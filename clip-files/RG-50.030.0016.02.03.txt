A: So first, as I said my oldest brother went, and the other brother went, and then my mother went, and she was caught, she was brought back to Warsaw to the quarantine, and then again everybody started out. We had several cousins everyone of the children, one cousin took care, you know, and it was fine, I mean there was a bite to eat.



Q: This was in Plonsk A: Plonsk.



Q: How did you get there? 01:53:17



A: Again, out of the ghetto, took a street car until the end of town and walk hundred kilometers. I mean it was a night and a day walk. Sometimes a horse and wagon go by, you used to jump it on it for a ride, like hitch hike.



Q: How much of you went at this time? A: By the end we were all over there, all.



Q: Right. But how many went in this little convoy of a hundred miles together? A: No one together, everybody separate, one by one.



Q: So you didn't go with your mother? A: No, no, no, no.



Q: And what year do you think this was? A: '41.



Q: Okay.



A: '41 because we were, we were there � I remember � the part of the summer, before '42.



Now, while in �



Q: Let me just ask you a question here, because I'm a little confused. I thought I had read that Korczak and the ghetto was evacuated in �42?



A: In '42, right, August '42. Yeah, you're right.



Q: So does that mean that you were still, that maybe you went a little later? A: Could be, yes.



Q: So, to Plonsk a little later? A: Yes, yes.



Q: Or did you go to Plonsk and come back?



A: No, no, no, I didn't go back. It was right after they took the children we went to Plonsk. The dates, you know. So we went to Plonsk and then the ghetto was created in Plonsk, and then it became already food not so much available, because a lot of people came, a lot of people came from all over other countries.



Q: And why did they go to Plonsk?



A: Because everybody had a sister or an uncle and it belonged to the � they call it � I don't know. There were a lot of Germans there in the area. And it belonged to � they call it the Third Reich.They call it a part of the Third Reich, and surrounded by farm lands, I mean rich. There was food. But so many people came there the food got less. So I try to find a way to make some money, so I used to buy in the ghetto cigarette paper, and went out of the ghetto and sold it to the farmers to make some money. And then I sold my two brothers. I didn't actually sell them, but I recommended to the farmers, if you need somebody to work for you just for food, is going to go. So I found a place for this one, and found a place for my oldest one; and then I look for myself.



01:56:07 While I was going, then I was also going to beg for food. I mean I went in and I says �If I can get something please?� One day a woman asked me, �A big boy like you shouldn't beg for food, he should become� � summertime you sent out the cows on a field, but somebody has to watch them that they don't go and eat the corn and the wheat, they should eat the grass � �A shepherd.� So I said, �Would you hire a Jewish boy?� She says, �My God, I would never believe your Jewish. But if your not gonna tell anybody, I won't tell anybody.� So, I make a deal with her, and I said, �I do it. By the end of the season you give me five�� it was by the meter then; I don�t know, five hundred pounds of potato and 80 deutschemark, and she set says, �You got it.� I went there, her son didn't know I'm Jewish, her daughter-in-law didn't know I'm Jewish, and there were a few boys 19 In 1939, Plonsk was annexed by the Germans along with the portion of Poland northwest of Warsaw. Wladyslaw Czaplinski and Tadeusz Ladogorski, The Historical Atlas of Poland (Warsaw: Panstwowe Przedsiebiorstwo Wyd. Kartograficznych, 1986), 50.



� never knew I�m Jewish, and I stood there the whole season, the whole summer. By the end of the term, they had to give me their potatoes. And the I took the horse and the wagon. And at that time the Germans brought in together potatoes and all that, and put them in basements, you know, down, to bury them; I don't know for what. So every for farmer had to donate so much. So I drove in with the horse and wagon myself. And they told me here, here, you have to put it here. And I says yeah, yeah, yeah, and I went straight to the house where my mother and my cousin was. We unloaded it, but we never had time to consume it. You know. And then �



Q: Was this ghetto very organized?



A: It was quite organized. But then, you had to be a residence, a resident, of that town. My oldest brother, who didn't survive, he used to go out with the daughter of the president of the ghetto. And they gave him an ID card that he is from here. One night they say everybody out in the field, all Jewish people out, out in the field; and they started to verify. Whoever had a resident card, the ID card could go home; whoever didn't have, about hundred brown uniform Germansthis way, one hundred this way, and everybody had their whip in the hand.



Q: I have to stop you. We're going to pick up. They need to change tapes. A: Okay.

Tape # 2



02:01:70



Q: We�re in Plonsk�



A: As I said, whoever had the ID card as a resident from the city were allowed to go home. I resumed normal activity. Whoever didn't have, there were about a hundred of the Germans in the brown uniforms on each side, making like a gate. Everybody had a whip, if they had to cut down a branch just to have something in their hands. And whoever didn't have it had to pass them. And everyone had to hit while running through. My two brothers and one sister were extremely lucky, they were the first one of the victims. So one German took them and walked them through that terrible gate. So the ones that get beaten should know to where to run. My oldest sister, unfortunately, wasn't so lucky she was beaten very badly, and then came my turn. They told me I had to go there, so I go there. So I was running like a snake, you know, nobody could hit me. I escaped everyone. By the very end one was waiting for me and hit me right across the face here and split my lip right open. When it was all over, they put us in trucks and put us in a field surrounded with barbed wire, and kept there I think for a day or so. No water to wash up or no food, no nothing, and then �



Q: What about your mother?



A: My mother was in Warsaw. My mother, she was then remained in Warsaw? Q: But she went to Plonsk for a while?



A: She did not make it because she was arrested on the Aryan side. She went to prison and she went to Warsaw. And she waited the for a chance to come to get some money or some goods for that person that smuggled the people out of the ghetto. So, we were there, and then we were put on trucks, and we were driven to a place called Pomiech�wek, which was a just a building, a big building, you know, with cement floor, and that's where we slept on the ground. No food, no water; waiting for a rain to come down with started to wash a little bit with the soap. Then the rain stopped. And eventually, after the third or fourth day, they brought in water in barrels of sour pickles. That water we drank, and then a little soup. And we were just kept there with, without saying anything to us or anything; we were just kept there. Guarded by Ukrainian soldiers which served the German Army. And I saw outside behind the gate, people from that town had relatives in that place, they used to come and brought a package. They called out the name and threw in a package, and the guards did not object. So I said to my sisters, you know what, why don't you go talk to them a little bit, flirt with them, distract them. They didn't know what I was about to do. When they went, I got down on my knees and dug a hole under the gate with my hands I dug a hole and crawled out, cleaned myself up, and stood up as if I were a visitor, you know. And �



02:05:00



Q: Were you scared?



A: No. And walked away, walked away; walked out on the highway with another boy. And I saw trucks of workers, I ask, �Where you going?� �Oh, we going to Plonsk.� I jumped on the truck and went to Plonsk. By then I was not afraid, I went straight to the gate to the Jewish policemen. �I am so and so, I am David.� David was my oldest brother, and the Jewish policeman was Moshe Niman (ph) who was friendly with my brother, you know. So I said, �I just escaped from Pomiech�wek.� I went in, and in a minute I was surrounded, �Who is the hero who is the hero? How could you escape from there?



What's going on there?� So I told them the story, and I go to my cousin. And by that time, I see my mother was there. She came from Warsaw. While we were all there. She came, oh, when she saw me, you know. And the rest of them apparently remained in this Pomiech�wek a few week until they evacuate them back to Warsaw.



Q: About how long was that?



A: I don't know, but it was quite a couple months I guess. They chased them on march back to Warsaw.



Q: Let me stop you a moment. When you got out of this Pomiech�wek? A: Yes.



Q: Did you feel any, anything about leaving the rest of your brothers and sisters in there?



A: If I feel any remorse, any guilt? Not really, no. It was � I felt that I'll be able to go there and get some food and bring to them. You see. I felt as a rescuer. You see like going to go to work. I figure I'll go, I'll get something and come back. Because being outside it didn't bother me, because I would appear as a resident of that town, it's legal there. And bringing a package was okay because they did not object.



Q: But, did you talk to people when they just thought you were Polish, and you told people you were just a Polish boy?



A: When I was begging? 02:07:30



Q: Yes.



A: Yeah, yeah, I did, �holy spirit, bless holy spirit,� [gestures sign of the cross] whatever you say, and �Can I ask for something?� They say �Why, why you begging you begging for something?� I say my, �Mother and father was killed in the war, you know, I am an orphan and I have nothing.� �What are you collecting?� I say, �Whatever you can, a little flour, a little barley, you know, some potatoes, a piece of bread.� So they gave me.



Q: You are how old now, about? Eighteen, 17? A: No�



Q: You�re still very young? 02:08:00



A: Then it was� we are talking now from '26 to '40? Q: '42.



A: No, no. From '26, '26 to '30 was 14.



Q: Well, Korczak was �42, so that makes you 16? A: Sixteen, I was in camp already.



Q: Okay, well Korczak �



A: Well, I was about 14, 15 then, before I went to Auschwitz. 15, but I was not developed because I'm hungry. So then my two brothers and two sisters, they were chased to Warsaw, and they told me they made a big fire so they couldn't go back. They were in Warsaw. Now, a postcard from, come from my two sisters to mother, �We are here. Icek is sick with typhus in a hospital, this one here. They have nothing to eat, they have no place to sleep. We are desperate, we are helpless, what are we going to do?� So, what is mother going to do? She takes off and walks to Warsaw to rescue the two girls and the two boys. By friends and so on, she found a little place where they can stay, they take him in. By that time, the girls came to Plonsk with that smuggler. The other brother, old, came, and he came. Then we were all in Plonsk already. And by that time, we were all in Plonsk, and during that time I sold my two brothers, you know, we spend like summer. And then the main evacuation started. Everybody, residents, non residents. Everybody transport, go to Auschwitz. So I think ours were the second transport that went to Auschwitz. My oldest brother remained because he was friendly with the president's daughter, unfortunately. If he would have come with us he might have been survived. So we went to Auschwitz, it was in the fall already. It was in the fall because I remember when we got dressed naked, the frost was sticking to my feet.



Q: You think this is '42ish?



A: I think it's '42ish, yeah.



Q: Okay, tell me a little bit about the trip to Auschwitz.



A: The trip to Auschwitz on the train, on a train me, my mother, my two sisters and my two brothers. Took about two on or three days, I think. No food, no water. I mean, the food � I mean we took a little bit of food with us, whatever we could, you know, and I was dressed in four suits, because there was a tailor down there, we didn't know where we are going he says take, take maybe we can sell, and � wherever we going, because it was resettling. We knew we were going to be resettled somewhere else.



Q: What other things did you take with you?



A: Take whatever we could carry, you know, suitcases, clothing, and what food we had. And I think they gave us some bread for the road, but water was � everybody was dying for water. So what my mother had, she had � she still had a very thin wedding ring. She gave it to a soldier so he could scoop up a little cup with snow for me, you know, she didn't � she couldn't take care of the others, but I was the youngest so he scooped up a little snow for the wedding ring. That was the last thing. And then early dawn one day we arrived on the ramp in Birkenauand he said, �Everybody out,� and we see the boys in the striped suits.



Q: So you were on this train, you had really no idea where you were going or what was in store?



A: No, no idea no, resettling, that's all.



Q: Was it at all frightening, or you didn't know? A: Didn't know, it wasn't even frightening.



Q: Okay.



02:12:20



A: Because we were promised we were going to a better place. We didn't know. So we arrived there, and naturally everybody out, you know. And the boys with the striped uniform say �Everybody out, go walk this way, walk this way.� Helping people and trying to carry the luggages, I mean we had to leave our luggage, we had to leave. And I 21 The German Army occupied Plonsk on September 5, 1939. A closed ghetto was established in May 1941.

know plenty, pots of pans, especially pots of pans. People used to make double decks and they hid some money in the pots or double suitcases. And then here comes big Mr.



Eichmann23



Q: How did you know that's who it was?



A: Later it I found out. I never knew, I never knew anybody, no. Q: Had you heard any stories yet?



A: No, no way.



Q: You knew nothing?



A: No way. In Warsaw there was a rumor that the they sending people to, they call it a fry pan, you mean they put people in the room and the floor turns over, and they get murder, so they call it a frying pan because a frying pan you flip over. 36 Never knew; nobody ever escape, never knew nothing.



Q: So when you arrive and see these people in uniforms and Germans, what's going through your mind?



02:13:37



A: We just didn't know who these people are, and then they speak JewishI said my God, people speak Jewish here, what is this? It's a paradise. People from Eretz Israelmaybe, you know, or something, because they spoke Jewish, �come out, come out,� and all.



Didn't give any indication whatsoever. Then it's ordered �women left, men right� or vice versa, separate men and women. Then the women and children were taken away, don't know where. Then comes men, you know, and I stay with my two brothers, try to make myself nice and tall and he says you know, pointing to two brothers on one side and two on the other side. I go, what do I know. And I stand for a while and I look and � first thinking, I see on the other side my two brothers are, about 45 boys, nice strong, and I'm between all people and children. And my brothers indicating to me like that, from far away. And I couldn't find a moment because the soldiers are were marching forth and back and watching, you know. And once the soldier passed me by and I snucked over to my brother, and he put me between him and the other one, they kept me there. And in a few minutes they told us to jog. And then we see Auschwitz �Arbeit Macht Frei�26 into 23 Adolf Eichmann (1906-1962), Nazi official who played central role in the organizing and execution of the �Final Solution.� Encyclopedia of the Holocaust, s.v. �Eichmann.�

26 Work Makes Free (German); infamous sign posted above the main entrance to Auschwitz concentration camp in the camp, and I was the youngest of the camp. And the part where I was, at that time they did not need any woman at the working camp. So all the woman were destroyed immediately, gas chambers, my mother, my sisters, and then the people where I was put, the older men and the children.



Q: Now, did you know this, or did it take some time for you to find out about your mother and sisters?



A: Later, later I found out, because we were speaking with people that work � that work SonderkommandoSonderkommando means they were putting people in the oven. So some people had indirect contact and they said the transport from Plonsk came so, you know, women came to labor camp. So then we came to find out. So here we come into Auschwitz, and people, you know, they put us up in barracks, and the beds are made so nice and straight, and everybody is afraid that they would not be able to make the bed. That came existed from before, you know, and German criminals were then political and the beds was straw sacks, and everybody got two boards to make the edges so straight and the pillow and the blankets had a stripe, and it was like a one hundred beds and one stripe. So many of them were afraid because we are given orders and people start asking questions, and then I shot off my big mouth in Polish, �What's the matter with you, don't you understand what they talking to you.� And one guy heard me and he said, �Come over here little boy, where are you from?� I says, �I'm from Warsaw.� �Oh, I'm from Warsaw too.� It was a Polish guy who was the bookkeeper here.



02:17:02 And then right away, �Here's a piece of bread, here's a bowl of soup,� and right away I'm a whole macherthere, you know. And I share it with my bothers, you know, and then they tell us to take off our clothes, it was frosty, completely naked, and the frost was � our feet were glued. And sent into the shower, shave the heads � the shower, and come out the other way, and we got striped clothes and we got our bowl. �This is your property.� Then we went for the numbers. They put the numbers, I talked to my brothers and I say, �We going to show you one day in the United States, I didn't even know United States exist.� So my brother got �630,� I got �631,� and my older brother, he curious, walked away, and we never saw him again. They counted out 50 people and took him away to coal mines to another camp, never saw him again.



Q: What were you thinking in all this process? 02:18:00

27 Special commando (German); A commando of Jewish prisoners in the six extermination camp selected to work in the gas chambers and crematoria. Encyclopedia of the Holocaust, s.v. �Sonderkommando.� 28 Influential person, �big-wig� (Yiddish).



A: I was thinking what's going on, we came to a camp, we are going to be kept, we are going to work, and until America will happen, something will be over.



Q: You thought this was just a labor camp, it wasn't going to be so bad?



A: Yes, I thought it was just a labor camp, and right away they took care of me, I didn't have to suffer any hunger, nobody was beating me up, you know, and we didn't have to work even, it was only � Auschwitz was only a passing. We were there about three days. Then we were walked off to Bunato another camp. We walk, and half the way, again we have to go into a place where they took our clothes and put it in the oven to disinfect it, to disinfect it, you know, and this was the dirty room and over there was the clean room. So, a part of the people walked from the � they went in the shower, and everything, they were waiting. And the people on this side wanted to know what's going on. So it was one of my cousins there, he says [draws forefinger across neck]. I said �no, nice,� and I show him a sign that they are not killing us, you know, just shower and disinfect so we are nice and clean. And we went to Buna. We went to Buna and we went to a quarantine again.



That was a camp quarantine. And again, I was the youngest, so they made me clean the block. It was a block�ltester30the head of the block, of the barrack. And he had a little room for himself with a bookkeeper, so he told me, �You going to be like my maid.� You know, every day I had to dust and clean and clean, and clean and dust, and help, like keep the spoon in the pot, you know. Cut the bread, make rations, and hand out the soup, hand out the potatoes, and try to put a little bit aside, and every night I give to my brothers a little bit more. So in quarantine you had to be like a certain time, and then you walked out to labor camp.



Q: How long was the quarantine?



A: I think a few weeks, about four weeks or so, you know. Q: Do you know what happened to your cousin or?



02:20:35



A: I didn't see him any more. When the quarantine was finished, this brother Joe worked labor camp, and they asked me if I want to remain where I am or if I want to go to labor camp. I says sure I want to remain where I am, you know. So I found a piece of bread, some potatoes my brother used to come every night I used to give him something and others. And during that time a transport came, and my oldest brother, that remained in Plonsk, came also. When he came, so, I was begging him, �David, whatever you do, try not to drink the water here, because it's very contaminated.� But he was thirsty, from the way he was drinking, he wouldn't listen to me, and also an excellent tailor so he made the 29 Buna-Monowitz (Auschwitz III), subcamp of Auschwitz.



30 Block elder (German).



hat for the block�ltester, but one of these people brought typhus with him, they took the whole transport and send them back, and my brother had to go back to Birkenau with them. And while he was marching he met his brother and he said they are taking him back to Birkenau, we are not going to see each other any more. They took him to Birkenau. A few days later they brought another transport, again typhus, and then they took everybody already even the people that were the supervisors and me too, to Birkenau, and right away I run look for my brother there and he was already taken to crematorium. He was gassed because he was sick. I didn't see him. And then Birkenau I remained.



Q: Your other brother, Icek? A: Yes. He remained in Buna. Q: He wasn't in the quarantine?



A: He was for the part that was required. Then he went to labor camp, but I had � they kept asking me, and asked me if I want to remain in the quarantine to do these little chores. I said �Of course, why not, I don't want to go to the hard labor. In here, what I do � I keep the place clean.�



Q: Let me ask you a question about Buna? A: Yes.



02:22:40



Q: In some of the reading that I've done, it said that one of the factories in Buna was making rubber. Do you know anything about that? Your brother said they were more involved with fuel and kerosene, or something of that. I had read that there was a big synthetics rubber plant over there.



A: There was the I. G. Farben31Farben, but rubber plant I don't know. Q: You don't know about that?



A: I don't know.



Q: That was one of the I.G. Farben businesses? A: Could be, could be, could be.



31 German limited company that was a conglomerate of eight leading German chemical manufacturers.



Encyclopedia of the Holocaust, s.v. �I. G. Farben.�



Q: Okay, please continue.



A: So then I remained in Birkenau, and doing all kinds of jobs. And again I met a landsmanyou know, and little by little, if you remain in one camp for long period of time, you get into a group, and you get an outlet a little bit to organize and to find a better place of work only where food was available. Like once there was a Dachdeck- Kommando (ph), which means a roof Kommando33and you had a chance to put a roof on the kitchen, work near the kitchen, so a piece of bread, little potatoes, or gone to the women's camp where you work in the women's camp, you know, and then there were girls, the hired girls, that had the little position like, �Here boy, here is piece of bread,� like playing little, little flirtation. There was nothing you could do, because God forbid you get caught talking to a woman, was bad for both them they were not allowed to talk us. And then finally I got a job to work with what they called Kanada. That was the cleanup Kommando. In other words, whatever the people brought on the transport we had to assort. Shoes separate, shirt separate, pants separate, and big, big wooden box where you had to put valuables in. So naturally if you found a hundred dollar bill or a gold coin, took it put in it in the condom, sticked it up, brought it into the camp, and traded for a bread for, you know, some people had connection with Polish civilian people that they brought the kielbasa, salami, bread, a bottle of vodka, and that's how we survived all those months.



Q: How many months were you with the Kanada group? A: A few months, not many months, not many months.



Q: Was it weird to be sorting out all these personal belongings? 02:25:35



A: You get, you get accustom to it. You get accustom. It's just the part of it. You know, no emotional feelings. Now, now any little thing I cry like a baby. But then, I could see my cousin or whatever, come to camp, and knew what's going to happen to him. I was looking, �he�s got a piece of bread somewhere or something if I could have something to eat,� because I knew he was going to perish anyways, I knew. You see. What we did, what we did as a group of boys, what we do makes me feel good. We also used to go to the ramp when the transport came. But we knew already what's going on, so when we saw a young woman with a child, with her mother, we took the child and gave it to her mother and say, �You hold it, it's better.� We didn't tell her why, because we knew if Eichmann sees a woman with a child, she is she goes to crematorium immediately, and the mother is an older woman, has no chance anyways. So, we gave her the child and we 32 Fellow countryman (Yiddish).



33 commando (German) able to send � to save the woman, and she go to labor camp and she could survive. Now one thing is going to be with me as long as I live. Here comes a Hungarian transport. By the end a lot of Hungarian. I don't remember now again the year, whether it was '43 or something, it was the last evacuation of Hungarians; two at daytime, two at nighttime.



One transport came, apparently they knew what's going on. When they came out of the train, it was during the night you could see the flames of the crematorium ten feet above the chimney. People just put on their praying shawls, you know, and say the last prayer. Apparently they knew. It was such a chaos � chaos?



Q: Chaotic.



02:28:03



A: You have, you know, we got all so emotional, and people are screaming and crying, and even the German soldiers got afraid they shouldn't be all right. �Go,� I say, �don't worry, don't worry, be fine.� And this other woman, �Oh Mutelesoon you going to get, going to get a shower, going to put you in nice clean bed, don't worry, just move ahead, just go, just go.� Here I walk over, and this young girl stays close to her mother, and I take her by the hand and I say, �You come and stay on the other hand.� And she takes me by my chin in Jewish and says, �I'm 18 years old, I didn't love in my life yet. Why do you take me to death already? Why you take me to death?� You know, like I would be the one. I says �No, no, what you talking about? You come with me you see, you'll be fine. I put you among all these young people.� I was able to save her, and she went through labor camp. But apparently she got crazy and she got destroyed, because I was able to, to, to come into the women�s, come into the women's camp once in a while by exchanging with somebody else that was carrying the kettles with food. So when somebody came into the camp with the food, I say you stay here today, I give them something and I took the food, and I wanted to see if she survived. She survived a few days, but she got crazy. This scene will remain with me for as long as I live. I was not emotional then, but she put such a guilt trip on me, and she said, �Why do you hate me? Why do you want me to die?� she says, �I�m only 18.� This was terrible. And the Germans are running so much that when I thought they had no room in the gas chambers, it was so active, that before every crematorium the dug a big hole very, very big, and it was burning fire and they used to put the people on blocks break up alive, into the fires burn them alive, the Hungarian transports.That was already way before the allied started to approach. And now, as I told you, my first miracle is when I escaped to go to Treblinka. The second miracle was when I came to Auschwitz. Here I am a worker now, and this SS woman is walking around always and looking and looking, and with her whip against her boots like that walking around like you know, proud and looking, looking taking numbers down, and she points at me to put my number down. Because I was in Birkenau, I was not a Muslim 34 Mother � diminutive (Yiddish).

She takes my number down, now the block�ltester knew why she takes my number down, they wouldn't tell me, but there was a request of sending out of Birkenau a few hundred people to another camp, to Stutthof, and he puts me there. And then he told me, �She took your number, she wants your skin to make a bag or gloves or something,� and he sent me away. And I escaped that, because they were making bags and gloves and lamp shades from our skins.



Q: How did you know this, or did you know this at the time?



A: I didn't know at the time, but later when they evacuated the complete Birkenau, that block�ltester came also, because block�ltesters, you see, they were all my inmates, you see we were all run by inmates. We got a barrack, you got a block�ltester, and then you got a stubendienstsomebody to see that it's clean, you know, that the beds are made and all that. When Birkenau was evacuated, then they took so many.But when the Allies � Russian were pushing, then they send us. So, my first was Stutthof, from Birkenau of Stutthof.



Q: Okay. I want to �



A: And he came also, and he told me.



Q: He told you how they were using the skins?



A: He told me, �You know why I send you here? You remember she wrote your name down.� So I says, �Why, what is it?� He says, �She wants to make a nice purse or gloves or a bag from you.�



Q: Did anybody that you know actually see this happening?



A: No, you know, they just took the boys, did whatever they had to do. Who could see? Q: But the prisoners �



A: No. Like they were castrating Jewish boys. Q: How did you know this?

A: Because what's his name, Morris, Morris he was a cook. He was a cook. His testicles were taken out, because he was with me in a few camps. So, I knew that he was taken, that he was taken, and then he said, �They put me to sleep, and whatever they did.�



Q: And he was aware that there were other boys � A: Yes.



Q: � that were in the same �



A: Yes, yes, he was aware of that, because as a matter of fact I was friendly with him. He was always a cook, and he always cook. So after when we would send food from one camp to another camp, I was maybe in 15 of them, but I don't know the locations because they used to send boys to build air strips. It means take big stones, break them up, make gravel, and then cover with cement. And every camp had a little kitchen. So, Morris was a chef � kitchen. So, I remember one day as we were walking, walking through German village, I saw an apple on the ground. I ran out and grabbed the apple and put it in my pocket. I think I'm going to give it to Morris that night and bribed him, you know, he had all the soup and all the potatoes he needs � but an apple. So, night at he came in to the barracks; I said, �Here Morris I have an apple for you.� So, for several days he brought me baked potatoes. Took raw potatoes and threw them in the fire. And one day they needed boys to peel potatoes, and he took me. One day the German took a truck and went with two boys to the village so the baker gave bread for the barrack, so he took me also. So the German gave me whole loaf of bread. I ate it up at once, because I had a bad experience with my men that slept with me, because I was a terrific worker, I always told to my � you � always a group, that we slept on the same platform � try to avoid to get beaten up � �Do as much as you can.� So, we work to please the contractor. The contractor had to make so many trips with his truck with stones, could so he could make more money. So I don't know at the time whether it was Christmas or something, he gave me like almost three quarter loaf of bread. So I figure, �I'm going to add a little bit to my every day rations.� Because once I went to Birkenau I was in trouble: No connections, no nothing no food, nothing to organize. So I depend on my strength and pleasing the civilian contractors, and they give me a nice piece of bread. And then at night I who to go use the big �



Q: Latrine?



A: Yeah, to urinate. Two minutes I came back, the bread was gone. He swallowed it so fast, he stole it from me. So I said to myself, �Next time anything I get, I don�t save, in here it is the safest.� And that poor man died in my eyes also, he didn't survive, Meir Bornstein (ph), he was French, from � French Jew.



Q: After you left �



A: Birkenau?



Q: No. I want to stay a little bit longer. You left � you stayed in the quarantine area longer? A: Yes.



Q: And then, when you left, you went directly to Birkenau? A: Birkenau, yes.



Q: You were there fairly early. Did you get involved in building anything, in � since a lot of the camp wasn't yet finished?



02:36:53



A: The only thing that was built was the Gypsy camp. An�another complete camp was added. That was � Birkenau was D camp. A, B, C, D, and then they were building Gypsy camp. It was building it was just � yes, it was putting together barracks. Putting together barracks that were prefabricated. We didn't know for what. It was prefabricated. We put them together every day, you know, Kommando means Baukommando � building Kommando. We used to go there and help put the barracks together. There were natural German civilian foremen, you know, and some professionals. It was very simple, a wooden barrack, no windows. And some German inmates became block�ltesters � block�ltesters means elders of the block � and they were by themselves to build an office for them, like � I mean not an office, a separate room, a stubeand they built an oven, an oven made out of bricks throughout the length of the barrack, just so high to be heated with wood, and then it was finished.



Q: This was in a separate area?



A: In Birkenau, but another camp like, it was like camp A, B, C, D, D was where I was, the D Lager. And then it was the Gypsy camp.



Q: So the Gypsy � did you know it was for Gypsies?



A: I don't know, but then a lot of Gypsies came, men and woman came together and they were kept there. They kept there for a while, and overnight one night they were destroyed.

40 A separate block for Gypsy families was established on February 26, 1943, when the first large transport of Gypsies arrived in Birkenau. Encyclopedia of the Holocaust, s.v. �Gypsies.�



Q: Did you have any contact with the Gypsies? A: No, just my first girlfriend was a Gypsy.



Q: Well?



A: German, German Gypsies from Germany. Q: You mean?



A: Yes.



Q: In that camp?



A: Yes.



Q: Because you were there fairly early, did you have a sense of the overall structure of Auschwitz Birkenau?



A: Structure?



Q: Well, I mean there were these different camps, and there were things going on in different places?



A: No, they were all the same. Birkenau was practically the same, the same barracks, you know. They all look the same.



Q: But in Birkenau was where the crematoria were? A: Crematoria, yes. We didn't get to see them.



Q: You never saw the crematoria?



A: No, we didn't. We saw the flames from a distance. I could smell like Sunday � we didn't work, you know � or at night you go out, you saw the flames. And the people they put in the oven, we couldn't get in touch with them also, because they were kept in a separate barrack, they called that Sonderkommando. And every few months they used to put them in an oven and get new, until they make an uprise, this Sonderkommando. They were to go up and got hold of some guns, but it was very fast made �hush, hush.� 41 October 7, 1944, Sonderkommando unit in Auschwitz-Birkenau Crematoria IV stage uprising which destroys crematoria facility � all participants are captured and executed.

Q: Did you see people going by you, going to the crematoria? Or groups? Anything like that, when they passed by you or�?



A: Well, when they were taken there were selections held, you know, selections held once in a while see who still has some meat on them, like everyone had to get naked outside you know, and MengeleDr. Mengele came out, and you had to present yourself, either you were sent to the barrack or sent on the side. The ones that sent on the side, they went to block number seven, seven, and they put a �L� on them here. �L� means generally means �leiche� � in English would mean �corpse.� They put in that block, and from then they put them in a truck and into the crematorium.



Q: You went through these selections often? A: Oh, yes, quiet often.



Q: How often?



02:41:15



A: Oh, many times, every few months; but I managed to � once I got � another miracle I escaped. Once I got pneumonia in Birkenau, and I went to hospital. And there were two Jewish doctors from Krak�w, and I remember they listen to me, and they made a picture of my lungs with little points, you know, they had no x-rays or anything, and they told me, �one thing will save you, you have to get some calcium.� Calcium you could only get injections from somebody who worked in Kanada, and in Kanada they had a little room where all the trucks came in they kept them there separately. So one of the men that I was friendly with got hold of calcium injections and put it in his rectum and brought it to me, and the doctors injected me, and I came out of it. But during that time was a selection, it was selection, but they manage to hide me. They confuse the number, somehow they confuse the number of the sick people minus less, minus one, and I got away. And then I got better again.



Q: What about the selections, you said you were in them every few months, but were they happening more often than that?



A: When there were enough sick people when they couldn't go to work, there were quite often, I don't exactly know, we didn't know what the purpose was, he says everybody up, you know.



Q: And was Mengele involved in all of them?



A: Indiana University Press, 1994), 239.



42 Josef Mengele (1911-1978?) , German doctor and SS officer.



A: I have no idea, but I knew that he was the main doctor, because when I went � when I went and I was so sick with fever, I knew that one boy, one boy went or man, he had done something with his finger, you know, I don't know what he, just took a scissor and cut and cut and cut to the bone. No injection or nothing.



Q: Were you aware of any of the medical experimentation that you read about now? 02:43:40



A: I saw � I don't know the experimentation, I saw one boy, there was a young boy running around in Auschwitz, it was a Polish boy, because once in a while they kept children � I didn't know the reason then, like they kept in Birkenau they kept two Rabbis two Greek Rabbis with beards, and used to allow them to pray in the shawls and made movies. Now I know it was for propaganda, so this boy was running around. All of a sudden I heard that the boy dropped dead. So there was a barrack where they did the experiments and I looked through a little pea hole, it was like the door there was spaces, and I saw they were cutting him. And I saw the they cut the scalp and pulled the skin over, I saw it, and there were � they took off the part of the scalp and I saw there was a big tumor on the brain, I saw it that with my own eyes, and I knew the reason they wanted to find out why he died. But to come back to the � to the �



Q: Experimenting?



A: Experimenting, I knew they going on, but I did not witness them because they were in all closed places.



Q: How did you know they were going on?



A: How I know they was going on, to tell you the truth, I didn't. I just found out later.



During my being there I didn't know, I didn't know.



Q: When you were with this Kanada group, how come you had to leave there? Did people have sort of a set time you were there? Did you get privileges?



A: No, no, no, no, how come I leave it was because eventually transport ceased, you know?



They stop coming, so they didn't need us any more, and then as the Allies start to approach, we were evacuated and took to Stutthof. Really it was a privilege to work there, to get to go there, an that Kommando was a big privilege because there was there was maybe 130 people, everybody was wanting to work there because you could wear any clothes you wanted, good shoes, good clean shirts, and there was � ladies were working there also, so everybody got somebody friendly, and every Friday this girl gave you a clean shirt.



Q: Did you tell me how you were chosen to work there? On that � in that�?



A: How I was chosen to work on that? I think recommendation by the block�ltester.



Recommendation that ask the Kapo� Zep, Zep (ph) was his name, �Why don't you take him.�



Q: You started to mention Sunday, you said it was not a workday. What happened on a typical Sunday?



A: On a typical Sunday. Q: Was it a day of rest? 02:46:50



A: It was a day of rest, it was a day of taking the lice off the clothes, sitting down and try to�



Q: That's mostly what you did on Sundays? A: Yes.



Q: Do you � what do you remember any humor, any enjoyment, any activities in the camp?



A: No, there were no humor because everybody was that hungry, you know, everybody was � I have death. The own entertainment was the gates when you walked out or walked in, the music, the orchestra was playing.



Q: What was it playing? A: A march, march songs.



Q: The Germans would play the songs?



A: No, it was inmates, everything was inmates it was a whole band. Q: Did it sound nice?



A: It sound pleasant, but who paid attention, because only as you walked by they were playing.



Q: Were there any concerts? Was there nothing like that?



43 Forman (colloquial German); term used for inmates appointed by the SS to head a labor Kommando of prisoners.



A: Concert, no.



Q: But your brother said that there were � I thought he said there were sometimes music, there was sometimes soccer games?



A: There was a boxing game, I remember there was a Polish guy I remember the name Czortek (ph), just for the, for the group of people for their entertainment � for the block�ltesters. But soccer games, I don't know of any soccer games. Maybe in his camp, not in Birkenau.



Q: There was no special �



A: No, no soccer games. The only activity Sunday activity was to witness how people got hanged or shot, because if somebody escaped they brought them back and they hung them and we had to witnessed that. Everybody had to see it.



Q: So you witnessed a lot of hangings?



A: Oh, yes. And then I remember very vividly they caught 22 Polish people, nice huge guys, six footers, very, very well. Apparently they were listening or operating some radio system. They got caught and they put first 11, and then another 11, at very close range they shot them dead, and the whole camp had to watch it.



Q: At close range?



A: Close range, yes, to make sure that they don't miss. And I understand that according to the law of � whether Geneva or general law � if somebody is being hanged and the cord breaks, the man can live. And I saw they hang a man, twice it ripped, third time they shot him. I don't know if it's true or not, the Geneva law, if you hang somebody and the cord breaks your life is granted.



Q: Now you say they have you seem to have pretty good relationships with the block�ltesters, and you seem to be able to charm them or finesse them?



A: Not really, not really. First of all in Auschwitz because I open up my mouth and I was the landsman � somebody from Warsaw and I was the youngest. And then so when I came to Birkenau, when I came to Birkenau there was one stubendienst � I mean one that took care of it � happened to be from the neighborhood Plonsk that was in the camp with my oldest brother, knew my oldest brother. So I got used to him, you know, so I became friendly with him a little bit, and then he knew somebody else, and that's how you get into the little group where you get a little more, but the block�ltester, they were already set up with their own group of people.



Q: How did somebody get chosen to be one of them? A: Stubendienst?



Q: Or a block-elder?



A: Well block�ltester were German inmates. The Germans got better positions, and his helper � and the Lager�ltester44you know.



Q: Were they mostly pretty horrible?



A: No, not really. Not really, not really. Not really. Q: Some of them were decent to you?



A: They were decent, but they wanted respect and discipline because they had to answer to the higher authorities also.



Q: But didn't they get points for treating you badly? A: No, no, no.



02:52:00



Q: Did you have strong relationships with a lot of the other inmates?



A: Not strong, but friendly, friendly we became like family, you know. Like I go to my brothers, I was friendly with two brothers, the Brown brothers, you know, we would be looking out for one another.



Q: You were?



A: Yeah, you know.



Q: Were there situations where you had to really just steal from each other and take care of yourselves?



A: Not from the immediate group, because there was no necessity, because everybody had a little bit, you know, and to steal from one another, there was nothing to steal from, unless the person was already in any minute he is dead, and the rations were given out, so another inmate is it near him and he got first to him and he took it.



44 Camp elder (German); prisoner functionary appointed by SS to serve as camp representative, but answering to the SS. Auschwitz Chronicle, 1939-1945, 827.



Q: Now, do you remember your reactions toward some of the prisoners who were treated better? For example, prisoners of war who were in there, or German criminals who were put in the camps and were given better positions?



A: If I had any�?



Q: Any sort of reaction to them? 02:53:30



A: Not really, because there were � they had their own gang again. They had � they were stuck with them.



Q: They had power over you, didn't they?



A: Oh, yes, they had power. They could ask us shine my shoes, you know, �Here is this, here's a couple cigarettes or here's a piece of bread,� because they always had a little more.



Q: Wasn't that strange? I mean, here they were in prison as well?



A: It wasn't strange because he was, he was like the boss because he was before me. He had the priorities, you know, and you were just newcomer, hey, so had you to wait until you [gestures rising up].



Q: Were you �



A: Priority. Was a priority.



Q: Were you ever aware of efforts to either resist or sabotage the hierarchy, or the Germans in the efforts � any resistance in the camp?



A: I know one thing, while I was in Buna, while I was in Buna a whole outfit of German soldiers in German uniforms were marched into the camp, the clothes taken away and put in striped clothes just like us. And then we wondered why, and we found out that they refused to fulfill an obligation that was against their will, never knew what, what it was, but something they asked to do and they refused, about 40 of them came into camp. So apparently that was a group that resisted their own people. But the inmates, nobody resisted anything. We were just afraid that nobody hits, us so we would got get beaten.



Q: Do you remember any specific advice you were given by people who had been there longer, or any advice that you would then give to new prisoners?



02:55:55



A: My only advice is � was not to be hitten, and try the best not to get sick, because people used to grab anything they can, me too. Found a bone, you know, from an animal, God knows where, that was in the in the later time, when I was hungry. I used to burn it in the garbage and chew on it the whole day. I had advice maybe you better go hungry and don't try to get sick. And advice, who could give somebody advice, because it was a survival from day to day. Somebody would say hey go over there, you could find something to eat or whatever. It was just survival, there was � I mean, what could anybody tell anybody.



Q: Well, they might know where there might be some food? A: They kept it for themselves.



Q: Let's change tapes.
