Q: Can you just beginning by stating your name, date of birth, and where you were born, whatever your name was, if at all different at any time? Whatever your name was then?







A: My name is Erwin Baum. I'm born on April 15, 1926 in Warsaw, Poland. Attended only � unfortunately four years school. Why I say four years, I couldn't make it to the fifth grade because I was beaten up by the Polish boys too much, so I failed to go to school. I made excuses to stay home. So I failed, and had to go for two years to grade four, and finally I graduated to the fifth grade, which I never made it; that's when the war broke out.







Q: Okay. The other thing I was going to mention to you, is that you don�t need to pay attention to the camera. You can just talk to me.







A: Okay.







Q: All right. Tell me a little bit about life before the war? What was your family life like?







What was�?







A: I was one of seven children. We lived in one big room in Warsaw, opposite from Army barracks. My father was a tailor, concentrated on making suits, uniforms for the officers and higher ranks. We lived quite comfortably. It was approximately 1933, '34, until my father got sick. And my mother also ran a little candy store up in front. My father got sick and eventually he died at age 48. I don't remember exactly the year, '45. I'm sorry, '35 or '36, and life became very, very, very unbearable, very hard for my mother and seven children to take care of us. We had to leave the apartment because we could not afford to pay the rent. So a gentleman by the name of � I think of Grenholc who had a factory and an a and a wood plant, where they cut wood and sold in round packages for heating, and also a factory of making cement blocks for sidewalks. And he offered to my mother a shed where she would sell coal and wood by the kilo, and we could have our place to stay. And I remember we were sleeping in that shed with the leaking roof, we had to put basins to catch the rain. It was very unbearable.







01:04:00 At that time my mother learned somehow that there is in existence an orphanage on Krochmalna Street, run by Dr. Janusz KorczakAnd when I speak of Janusz Korczak, I 1 Janusz Korczak (1879-1942), physician, writer, and educator. In 1912 he was appointed director the Jewish orphanage at Krochmalna Street in Warsaw, Poland. Israel Gutman, ed., Encyclopedia of the Holocaust (New York: Macmillan Publishing, 1990), s.v. �Korczak, Janusz.� would gladly give half of my life for him, that kind of a man he was. Mother tried to get somebody to � made an application, because she never learned how to read and write, none of us could to fill out any papers. Finally, application was made, and very intensive investigation took place, and I was accepted to this orphanage. However, my mother said I'm the youngest child and she would like to keep me around her as long as she can. So my brother Icek, which he calls himself Joseph now, if possible he would go in. So he was accepted to go in full-term, and I went to visit him, and I never wanted to go back. I was always crying when I had to go back home. So they give me permission to be � they call it �half internat,� internatwas orphanage, that mean that I could spend the whole day, have my meals, go to school, but I have to go home to go to sleep. Again, every night I cried when I had to go home. And life was so wonderful; they served five meals a day, and Dr. Korczak and all the supervisors and all the counselors made sure that every child eats properly this. They actually stood over your head and made sure you had your meal, that you feel good, and went to school for � you see? And we were so respected at school, anybody that was from Korczak�s home. Every month we went to a summer camp, which actually my brother was entitled to go for two months, but he gave one month to me. He went one month, and I went one month. Children had to be seven years old in the first grade, and they were kept until they were fourteen. When they reach fourteen they received two suits, two pair of shoes, a room and a job. Out, somebody else took place. When my brother finished his terms, I was accepted and I went in for the last two years, I think. And my life was just, just, just wonderful there. And then in 1938, '39 or '40, unfortunately the war broke out and everything became like turmoil, with the bombardments of small towns and some children started to come into our orphanage.







And Dr. Korczak just could not refuse anybody. Before there were only 107 children. There were 51 boys and 66 girls.







01:07:00







Q: I'm going to stop the you there a minute, because I want to ask you some questions about the orphanage.







A: Sure.







Q: But let's just go back a little bit before that. You had mentioned that there were children beating you up when you were a young boy?







A: Yes.







Q: Was this because you were Jewish?







A: Only because I was Jewish. Especially when religious classes took place. Jewish children 2 Boarding school (Polish).







3 Later in the interviewee states that there were 56 girls in the orphanage. The latter number would appear to be correct, since 66 and 51 do not add up to 107.







had to step out into the hallway for that hour. And when the religion class was over, all the boys just walked up and say �You killed Jesus,� and start to beat up on us. So since my mother had a candy store, I used to manage, for that day, to have some candies in pocket and bribe them, or a few pennies. But that was not the case always, so I always found an excuse to my mother when there was a religious class, I said I don't feel good, or there was a day off when the teacher is sick. I just didn't want to go to school because I couldn't bear being beaten up all the time.







Q: Now this was way before?







A: Way before the war; way before the war. Till I got into Dr. Korczak�s home.







Q: Now, also were � I mean you lived in an area where there were a lot of gentiles. A: Um-hum.







Q: Did you have any good friends or nice neighbors who were not Jewish?







A: We had neighbors, but I could not have any Polish friends, they were just � I think it was the finger is always pointed the at me, �Zyd. Don't play him with him he is a zyd.�







Q: And did this change or get worse once the war began? 01:08:45







A: Yes, it got worse when the war began. When the war began, for instance when the German walked into Warsaw they came in with trucks and handed out loaves of bread. So right away a line; and wherever it was a line, I stood in the line no matter what the reason was, because I knew I was going to get something. And if the Polish kids they pointed to me and said in German, �This man is a zyd.� So I had to run before I got beaten up.







Q: Do you remember the day the war broke out? Do you remember what was happening?







A: The war broke out when we came back from the summer campAnd I remember one of our neighbors came running to my mother and there was headline in the newspaper. "War started." And I say it in Polish; it said �wojna rozpoczeta,� in Polish.







Q: When �







A: A tenant that was friendly with my mother, she lived on the same floor where we lived, 4 September 1, 1939, war is declared when German troops cross over Polish frontier. Charles Messenger, The Chronological Atlas of World War Two (New York: Macmillan, 1989), 22.







and she was friendly with my mother because my mother was the first one that got � how you call it when you, you put the laundry through to �







Q: To wring it?







A: To wring it. A salesman came and sold to my mother to pay one zloty a week to him. So this lady borrowed always from my mother.







Q: And this was a non-Jewish?







A: She was non-Jewish, and she was friendly because she could, you know, she was friendly with my mother.







Q: So you found out that the war broke out? A: Yes.







Q: And what next signs did you see?







A: The reaction was exciting because we didn't know about war. And matter of fact, the feeling of war existed prior to start of the war, like being in the camp; we had a big place where we played in sand, building airplanes, building boats, building different things.







That summer we told everybody not to play, we are going to play war, like we made Polish Army and German Army. Me and other boy, we had a Polish army, and there was another boy by the name Mojzesz was the German Army. I was called Froim in the orphanage, I was also called MalyIcek. Icek is my brother, I'm the small Icek. So there was the army of Moses and the Army of Ariel and Froim � Ariel was the second general. And we prepared bunkers and all these things. And for bullets we would save chestnuts, and when the war broke out, we start throwing chestnuts. When we got hit three times, had to be carried out, so that was the feeling that naturally Poland lost, and Germany won. So then after the war � when the war started, naturally our building was one of the first to get burned down because they had announced that Solna number eight, where we have a room, is a point of refreshments for soldiers. A little bit later a bomb came down; an airplane was just cruising about, and they couldn't stop the fire or anything, and the building went down.







Q: Where were you? 01:12:20







A: We were in the apartment, and we ran out when the fire started. We ran out and just 5 children�s summer camp sponsored by Korczak�s orphanage.







6 Small (Polish).







crying, you know. We didn't have time to take any bedding or anything because it was full already. And then we marched off to one of my sister, which was married by then, she lived near the airport. We walked over there. And then couple days later, the they marched in the soldiers marched in.







Q: Do you remember what you were thinking, or were you terrified?







A: Not terrified; kind of excited. Because the notion was that Jewish people and the German were getting along because, basically more or less understood the language, could communicate more or less. So we believed it wouldn't be too bad.







Q: So you didn't have much information in terms of what was happening in Germany?







A: Not at all, not at all. Not interested, only to satisfy them, our hunger, because when the war broke out, right away everything was � all the stores were closed. There was no food available. And even in the orphanage, you know, it became rations like, you know. Food was available; Dr. Korczak saw to it that we get food, but � it appeared on the blackboard: Two slices of bread, or three slices of bread; as much as we can. And I will never forget, Dr. Korczak used to stand over us in good times. I remember good times and I remember bad times. In the good times he used to go behind the children and make sure they eat. And as a joke, if somebody was holding a piece of bread, he used to pull it out, grab it and put it in his mouth. Now I also remember when it appeared two slices each, also for Dr. Korczak two slices, but he never ate his two slices, he gave to another child. Every day he gave his bread to somebody else. And we stupid children, we took it. We never realize that the man grows thinner and thinner and thinner; that kind of man he was.







Q: So you hadn't heard anything about Kristallnacht or � A: No.







Q: And the Polish community, were they generally supportive of what the � of the Germans?







A: Oh, yes, they cooperated, and gave them all the information that they want. Q: Okay. Back to the orphanage.







A: Yes.







Q: You went in there, you think probably around 1937, '38? A: '38 and '39, that's for sure.







Q: Tell me a little bit more details about your life in the orphanage. How it was organized?







About some of the staff?







A: Well.







Q: If you want I can ask you a specific question. 01:15:41







A: Well, it was Dr. Korczak and there was Stefa Wilczynskashe was the head, and there was Mr. Aleksander Lewin � whom I met in Poland in 1988 � and there was Misza Wroblewski who were the staff. Strictly, I mean staff for the good of the child. Just see the child. We got in the morning when the alarm clock rang everybody had to go up, get up. If somebody overslept, they had to go to bed seven o�clock the next day. The beds had to be made. Everybody had to do their chores. Everybody had an assignment. You see, like my assignment was to wipe the tables, prepare the tables. And then we had a chance to change our assignments every second or third month. We had our court. We had a court run by children. It was run by children. If a child did something wrong to another child, you could sue him. And the judges were children. Even Dr. Korczak got sued by one child. He did something he put, I think he put a boy into a bottle of water, just as joke, and the boy didn't like it and he put him to court. And he received paragraph 100. Paragraph 100, it wasn't so terrible, but he didn't act properly. Since then he have the name setka � hundred. Setka means a hundred in Polish, so his name was setka. If any of Dr. Korczak�s is still alive, we ask how they call Dr. Korczak it was setka.







Q: What did that mean, paragraph 100?







A: Just paragraph 100 means, translated, did not do right. Paragraph 300 was receive for dishonesty.







Q: What were the � what was a typical punishment for one of these?







A: Well, if you accumulated certain paragraph you were deprived of something. Like a bicycle was given; and every child could ride that one bicycle at a certain time. But if during the year you accumulated 2,000, no bicycle. Okay. There were certain privileges taken away for getting too many paragraphs.







Q: How did you feel about this whole system?







A: Nice. It's involved. It's like a � it's like you were programmed to be good, you wanted to be good, you wanted not to have � see like one boy went � everybody had a little drawer in a big, big cupboard and you kept your things, you know, whether it's a comic book or 7 Stephania Wilczynska (1886-1942), head teacher and co-director of Korczak�s orphanage.







some cards or chestnuts, we used to play a lot of chestnuts. And that one boy open up my drawer and steal some chestnuts. And, actually, I sue him and he received a paragraph 300 that was for dishonesty. Now one boy was an invalid. I remember very well his name was Alter (ph). He stole a pair of swimming trunks from somebody. He received paragraph 2,000. You know what that meant? He had to leave the home, dismissed. His mother in no way could afford that boy, but it was given by the court, by the judges and that nothing could be done. He was thrown out of the orphanage. So we knew, we children knew you can't mess around, you have to obey. We were put in four categories, category one, two, three and four. Category number one was neat, clean. When we used to go Saturday to visit our parents, one parent our relatives, whoever was there. We received little bag of cookies, and Mrs. Wilczynska stood up front make sure the shoes were shined, hands clean, you could go. Seven o�clock you had to be home, you didn't come home by seven o�clock you didn't go next Saturday. Now category one and two, if somebody � everything was donation food, rich people. People donated material. If a lot of material came in, category one or two received a new coat or a new suit. Category three and four already, you know, got something was a little bit used. So it gives us always the inspiration, you know, your bed should be made nice, you know, behave nice, clean.







Q: Did the discipline seem strict or it seemed fair? 01:20:30







A: Not strict, not strict at all. I mean the punishment was normal, but you could live with it.







You knew, don't do it unless you have a reason. Like, when we were in the summer camp, you were allowed twice a month two visitors. Now I remember one time when my brother was there, it was in the first month of the summer, I went, my mother and my sister. So I figured my mothers, my sister were legally to visit my brother, and I, because I was part of it going to half time, I had the right to come. But it wasn't so. One girl was walking around, she saw three people and she wrote it down. Nothing. When my turn was there, I was not allowed any visitors. See, so you just know. The rules were made, you obey them. And everything went fine.







Q: Everybody get along well?







A: Very much so, very much. There were no fights, everybody had a big brother when you step in. You had a big brother, like he took care of you and says if anybody is going to say something wrong to you or do something that you don't like, come and tell me, he told us. As a matter of fact, I had one big brother, his name was Sammy Gogol. This boy was gifted playing the harmonica. Never took a lesson in his life, but he could play anything you want, any opera, anything he could play. So he was my big brother. I enjoyed him very much. When I was � I mean, we lost contact with each other, you know. I didn't go to the orphanage. I walked in, I went out, I went in, I came back, nobody saw me, nobody asked me. I was torn apart. I didn't know whether to stay there or to go to my mother. Since I was a hustler, I used to know how to jump out of the ghettos. I was begging for food. So I brought � sometimes I brought something for the orphanage, and I wanted to see that my mother was � had something to eat.







Q: This was while you were �







A: While I was in the orphanage, but I was kind of � I took it upon myself, I saw that there is no more discipline, there is no more control, because instead of 107 children, there were at that time over 200.







Q: How come there was so many?







A: Because Dr. Korczak could not refuse anybody, you see. Q: This was the after the occupation?







A: Yeah. The gentleman I gave you the name before, David Kohl, his parents were shot, were killed. And somebody brought him there. How could he refuse him.







Q: This was after Germany had occupied �







A: If after the occupation, this is � I am speaking this was during the ghetto, all right. Q: So you wouldn't living in the orphanage any more?







01:23:30







A: Not on fully basis. When I felt like staying over, I stayed over. If not, nobody knew whether I'm coming or going. But if I brought a little bag with flour or a sack of potatoes or some coal, it was accepted. But they didn't ask me where were you yesterday, because, you know, a lot of people, even a lot of the counselors went to Russia, escaped. Only Dr. Korczak was there to the very end. So then naturally one morning I � one night I was out, I used to jump out of the night always where I couldn't be seen. And I came one morning and the house was empty. They were all taken, the children were taken.







Q: At the orphanage? A: At the orphanage.







Q: I want to get about that, but let me just ask you a few more questions about the good days at the orphanage.







8 The Warsaw ghetto was established on October 2, 1940. Encyclopaedia Judaica Research Foundation, Encyclopaedia Judaica (Jerusalem: Encyclopaedia Judaica, corrected ed.) , s.v. �Warsaw.�







A: Yes.







Q: Now, when you all had these jobs, did the girls have different jobs than the boys?







A: No, no, no, they were, they were, they were jobs just to keep the house in order. Like peeling potatoes, helping with the dishes, putting up the cutlery on the tables, taking off, cut the bread, clean the windows. Sweep the bedrooms or sweep the dining room. So it was no difference. Some girls work in the sewing room, you know, putting on buttons and mending socks.







01:25:70







Q: They were basically treated the same? A: Same. Yes, same.







Q: And did you � what were the people on the staff, the counselors and all of that like? Was there usually a close relationship with them?







A: Not close, they were like � you know, how shall I say it, like teachers; supervising homework, and if somebody was not good enough, they helped out; they were like summer school. Like if you didn't have very good marks, they didn't force, but they suggested to take classes at the summer school. And they were helping you out, you know, just so you get better.







Q: And was this sort of divided men and women?







A: It was men and women equally. There was a teacher that used to teach us how to sing, there was a piano, whoever wanted to learn piano. I mean... Q. And you went to school outside of it?







A: School was outside, yes. But if there was a parent meeting, one of the counselors from the orphanage went because they wanted to have the full picture of the child, of the behavior, if there was any problem between the teacher and the counselor of the orphanage.







Q: But there wasn't a certain rule, by some of the women to be surrogate mothers to you, or







�







A: No, no, no, no, no. We used to � we used to address them as �pani� or �pan� � means







9 Miss/Misses (Polish).







10 Mister (Polish).







Mr. or Mrs.







Q: I know that they also brought some cultural activities?







A: Oh, yes, it was cultural activities, a lot of cultural activities. Q: What do you remember specifically?







01:28:50







A: Playing theater, I took part, as a matter of fact, in one � I don't remember, I think Sleeping Beauty, I think Sleeping Beauty. That was my part just to say a word that when the boy slept and said, �oh, what a wonderful dream I had,� something like that. And my part was, �Oh, let's wake him up very fast, because he is going to sleep he is going to get cross, and he won't be able to go on the outing � you know � on the trip.�







Q: Tell me a little bit about Dr. Korczak?







A: Well, it was Dr. Korczak how should I describe him? Was he superman, he was, a king, he was. Just a good, good old grandpa with a face of an angel, with his hands, they were little, like pillows so soft to touch, and so lovable. When he came, he just, he just felt like get inside of him.







Q: How did he do all this?







A: He had a habit of � if a child had a loose tooth, you know, he used to put his hands and somehow, without any pain, got the tooth out and give 50 cents to the child. And he collected all these teeth, and from the teeth of the children he build a little castle. How he did that all the time, is not to comprehend how he found time, but he had time for every child. Somehow he had time for every child. And he loved every child. No matter how, if a child came in from outside, if a desperate mother brought in a child that he was or was not accepted, the child could have been sick, full of pimples or whatever, Dr. Korczak took him in and kiss him right away. Whether he could accept him or could not, because, as I said, before the war was strict, 51 boys, 56 girls. One went out, another one could come in. But there was an application, a list very long.







Q: Now, he was out trying to get money and supplies all the time, but he was � also you felt he was around a lot too?







A: He was around, he was around a lot. Very, very, very much so. And all the supplies, all the donations were given by rich people before the war. And we produced for them nice place and concert. Like I say, somebody go play the harmonica, and there was another boy Jonas, number nine, he was a terrific violinist player, terrific. You know, we gave concert to this big � how you say digni�dignitary.







Q: Dignitary?







A: Dignitaries, yes. And naturally they saw, they could see where there money is going. To 107 children very well behaved, you know, nice clean dressed. So they knew in that the money is going for a good purpose. And suddenly, during the ghetto, when there was not much available, he just went and begged you know, to the JointThere was this man, the head of the Warsaw ghetto, Czerniak�w12I think. And Dr. Korczak used to manage to get always a couple sacks of potatoes, more than anybody, any other organization. We had our own horse and wagon. He had that capacity, the tongue, you know. And he was offered many time by the Polish underground to escape. He would not leave us. He would not.







01:31:00







Q: You said earlier that once you went to school, after you were part of the orphanage, you had a new respect?







A: Very new respect. Because they teaches us, the new student, the child of Dr. Janusz Korczak. Like there was � children got homework, okay? And the children had homework, so like she says, �For the next day or so you had to memorize page number so and so.� So certain children were reading, and they say, �Next, the student Baum, the child of Dr. Korczak.� I know everybody knew, so I read it, you know, and then was a different story. I don't know why, how. They knew that Korczak was like god. Because first of all, it was only Jewish person who had the program on Polish radio. Polish radio started, �Doctor, oh doctor.� Everything was children. He was � nothing was writing children�s� books. So, Polish children knew him. Also he took care of Polish, he participated in other orphanages that had only Polish children, non-Jewish. He was everywhere, and we, we gratefully thankful we had plenty of him also.







Q: So, when you were saying you got more respect, this was respect from non-Jewish?







A: From non-Jewish. The beatings stopped, the beatings stopped. And then eventually I went to a school where it was more Jewish than non-Jewish, it was in the � more in the Jewish area. So, it was okay.







Q: But it was mixed?







A: It was mixed, yes, it was mixed. The teacher was Polish, but nice. 01:32:55 11 American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee.







12 Adam Czerniak�w (1880-1942), head of Warsaw Judenrat (Jewish Council).







Q: Okay. Let's talk a little bit about the war now. When were you sent to the ghetto?







A: When everybody else went the ghetto. When the ghetto started, we lived down in the � like I said, the shed of the coals. The owner, apparently he saw what's going on, he left the whole thing and give us his trailer apartment, it was like a trailer apartment. We lived there for a while. And when the ghetto started, we had to find somebody to exchange apartments. Like people that the area was designated for ghetto, and they were not Jewish, they had to find apartment outside the ghetto. So we gave up our apartment, which was quite nice, in exchange for a small room like this, with an attic. And we crammed in, all of us, all six children. And one of my sister walked off to Russia. She went to Russia in 1941, just prior to the ghetto. She got married and went to Russia. To this day, I never heard from her. We had one postcard and that's it. We are still looking for her.







Q: So you were out of � you were officially old enough to be out of the orphanage at this point?







A: Ah �







Q: When the ghetto was formed?







A: If there would be no war I would still have a year or two. But I was � I was such a hustler, because like even before the war, when daddy was dead already and there was no food, and mama couldn't support, I was able to go to work at the plant; sit a presser all day, and by the end of the day, we receive one � one you received one zloty, and one zloty brought one bread and a smoked fish. And when I brought it home there was seven o�clock, my oldest brother jumped to the ceiling, because it was breakfast. And I was about maybe nine, ten years old. And see my brother Joe was in the orphanage, and the rest of the family was hungry. So instead of spending the day in the orphanage where I could get my good meals, I went to work so I could get some cash to buy a bread and smoked fish and bring home.







Q: So you left the orphanage early, or you were in and out?







A: In and out, I didn't leave it, you see, because I was torn apart. My mother and brother and sister were hungry, and I could get five meals there, so certain days I just didn't go.







Q: So �







A: Try to feed the family a little bit. Q: And you were the youngest?







A: The youngest, yes. The youngest and the hustler, always the hustler. Q: So in 1940 when the ghetto was formed�?







A: Yes.







Q: You all moved in, and at that point you�re back with your family. A: Yes.







Q: Your mom was � you�re not in the �? A: Yes.







Q: You weren't �







A: Yes, I was in the orphanage, I was in and out of Chlodna and Siennabut not officially full-term, because then there was no more � I mean there was no more such a control, and no more that they knew everybody is here. If you came, you came, you were welcome.







You were never sent away.







Q: So it became a little more chaotic? A: Right chaotic and sickness.







Q: Do you remember the move, when the orphanage had to move into the ghetto; do you remember that?







A: Yes, yes. We had the, we had the horse and the wagon, and there was Mr. John Zielinski, and we moved little by little, you know, and the kids helped as much as they could. And we moved to a school, but from the school we moved somewhere else, I just don't remember the street. We moved several times.







Q: Did you � was that was that an upsetting �







A: Very upsetting, because, sure, because the first orphanage home was a beautiful building, you know, and every child has his own beautiful bed, and every child has his own place in a big cupboard, and every child had his seat at a table in dining room, and, I mean, it was home. It was home. And over there we were we just cramped together; it was � it wasn't nice. But Dr. Korczak gave us aspiration and hope. You know, we just looked whatever he does, whatever he says.







13 Chlodna and Sienna were streets within the confines of the Warsaw ghetto. Chlodna 33 was the location of Korczak�s orphanage after it was forced to relocate from the Krochmalna building. Janusz Korczak, The Warsaw Ghetto Memoirs of Janusz Korczak (Washington, DC: University Press of America, 1978), 64.







Q: For � how long was Dr. Korczak able to really maintain sort of the organization of the of the orphanage? Did everybody still have their responsibilities in the ghetto? Was he still able to bring you food?







A: Until the end. He was able to bring some, you know, he was able to until the end. His struggle was like survival, but not for him, but for the children. He virtually got out and begged. He begged for my children he begged, you know.







Q: Did you ever see him do this?







A: Oh, yes; his life deteriorating, you know. He just would not walk away. You know, he stood in front of that door with that Joint representative, he says, �Doctor, I cannot help you, I cannot do it.� But, he says, �But my children.� And he used to wear the Polish uniform. He refused to wear the Star of David.







Q: I see. Why is that? 01:38:30







A: Because he served in the Polish Army.He was an officer. He refused. He was arrested once for not wearing it, but still refused to wear it. �But my children, but my children.� And he had a lot of support from non-Jewish organizations also. So we always had a little bit more than the people outside of the orphanage. But naturally not enough, because when you were hungry, you were hungry no matter how much you get. But this poor man, he was growing thinner and thinner and thinner, and he just ate very little.







Q: Did you � at that time were you too young to think, �I wonder why he is getting so thin?�







A: Who paid attention? You were so hungry and so eager we became like non-human any more. When you're hungry, it's just terrible. Now I think of it, why did I take that slice of bread that he gave me, I cannot forgive myself. I mean the guilt, you know�.







Q: Where were you when the orphanage was evacuated? 01:40:00







A: When the orphanage was evacuated15I remember I was there the day before, and then I went over and help my mother bring over the bread, and at night I spent, either I spent home, or I was out of the ghetto, because I managed, I figured out it's better at night to 14 Korczak enlisted in the Polish Army in 1919 and served as a military doctor.

come out of the ghetto and be on the Aryan side, and wait until it gets dark again to come back, or earlier dawn. So I was out, and then I managed to get some food. I think there was some grains or whatever. I was begging. And I ran so happily, you know, to the orphanage. And while going there, a woman come and, �Oh God they took the children, my God they took the children, my God they took the children,� you know. She was crying, and I said, I � where, so pointed � she pointed to the Umschlagplatz. The Umschlagplatz means the station where the trains came. And I ran there, I wanted to go there to him, you know. The German �Get lost, you are not Jewish, get lost.� And I saw that he was, by the end he was kind of disputing with a soldier, I found out later that they had papers for him and a passport for him to go to freedom, and he wouldn't go.You know, he went to the train and went straight to Treblinka, and I was left alone, and now I figure they took away my last hope from me, what am I going to do without him? How am I going to survive without him? You know. So I went back to mother. I didn't know where to go, I just didn't know. So I went back to mother, and from there we struggled, one by one to go out of the ghetto and go to Plonsk, where my mother had a sister.







Q: Okay, let me�. Are you okay? A: Sure.







Q: Do you want to take a second? A: I'm all right.







Q: Can you tell me, what were some of the things that you saw and experienced? What was life like, not just for you, but for your family in general?







A: Well, hunger, starvation, sickness. I mean... Q: You were aware of this as a child?







A: Yes. I saw it on a daily basis. I virtually walked over corpse, there were corpses lying around every day, everywhere.







Q: What did you think when you saw this?







A: Callous. How to, how to find an extra piece of bread, maybe there is a broken down store where you could find something that you could take, trade or sell or whatever, because there was a market, you know, there was like a here you call it a flea market, that you had something you could go sell in exchange, like my sister had a nice red coat with an fur collar made of Alaskan seal, so she didn't see, my oldest brother stole it from her, went to 16 Reputedly, Korczak had been provided with papers for his release by CENTOS (Federation of Associations for the Care of Orphans in Poland).

the market, sold it, and bought a bag of flour, brings home a bag of flour, very excited. And my mom cooks it, and it wasn't flour, it was plaster. These things were going on.







Q: As a kid, you were walking over a dead body, what � do you remember what you were thinking?







A: Found it natural, I said, oh just another poor soul, another poor soul. Just make sure I'm not going to be in that position.







Q: And what was your mother doing?







A: Nothing, but just sitting there and waiting and completely frustrated, not knowing how to prepare, how to find some frozen potatoes or some potato pills, or something to feed these kids day by day. As a last resort, I remember one day she didn't have anything to sell any more, so she had golden crowns, pulled out the golden crowns. She went to a dentist and had them taken off for a few zlotys just so we could survive a couple days or so; she sold the golden caps.







Q: Was there any school? A: No school.







Q: Or studies?







A: No. There might have been, but who had patience for that. It was just a daily way how to survive, how to get, how to get something to eat.







Q: Were you aware of any activities, like cultural activities or anything?







A: Not interested. I was not interested at all. I didn't want to go to school, I didn't want to participate in anything, only hustle. My best activities was jumping over the gate, run to the Polish market, buy a few loaves of bread, throw over. That gave me pride that I could do it.







Q: How did you learn how to do that?







A: They say in Jewish, tzuristeaches you how to survive, how to survive. Q: Weren't you afraid?







A: I was not, no. First of all, once I got through that Polish policeman I was fine, because I spoke good Polish, you know. And the farmers did not recognize me. I didn't deal with







17 Troubles (Yiddish).







any young � with any gang, so they didn't recognize me. And once legitimately, I bought I paid them, because out of the ghetto you didn't need any rations, so you put down the money and they sold you, one loaf, two loaves. So I took about three or four and run in, if I threw them over several times, so by the end of the day was one bread profit.







Q: So tell me, how did you get to the Polish side? How did you do this? Did you have a system for getting out of the ghetto?







01:48:50







A: As I said, there was a fence. And there was spaces between the boards, so my mother used to put her hands like creating a step ladder and I stepped, stepped and jumped over, jumped over. Once I was on the other side, I was waiting for a car18because the cars were going slow from the court or to the court. Once I was on the other side, I was in the middle of the street. And that was not the ghetto, that was the part that people were going to the courthouse.







Q: You said you went through the board or you went over?







A: Over the boards. She made like a stepladder for me, so I went. And the boards wasn't very high, especially on that street it wasn't very high. Luckily there was no wire fence or no cement blocks, just board, and it had a space where my mother could get her hands in there. And I used to step on her hands one by one and jumped over.







Q: Between each of the boards, that's where she put her hand in a to make the ladder? A: Between the boards.







Q: Between them, right? A: Between the boards.







Q: And how come the guards didn't see you?







A: Because they were quite � maybe 200 feet, on the corner of the street. And I � when I went out, I went in the middle of the block. And on the corner there was the police guard, just seeing that the cars going there.







Q: Now, were there other kids doing this?







A: Some of them did it, yes, quite a few did it. Some policemen looked away, and some were very nasty and tried to catch us, and we run fast. Sometimes they could catch us,







18 Streetcar.







sometimes they didn't. Once he got me. It was wintertime all the snow, and I couldn't run so fast. I fell down and he started hitting me with a club and took all the breads away from me.







Q: So you threw the bread over the fence? A: Yes.







Q: And your mother was waiting for you on the other side?







A: She caught them and she could sell them immediately to the people that could afford. And I was waiting there for ten, fifteen minutes, and she pass me the money and I went on another trip.







Q: What was it like on the other side?







A: A new world. Restaurants, food available, everything. I was afraid to go there, first, first of all, I couldn't afford it. I was afraid to go to a restaurant because they could tell on me, because the way I was dressed, you know, in rags.







01:49:25







Q: What were the Polish kids on that side doing?







A: There were no kids, because it was like commercial street, and mostly cars going into the court. So there were no houses. The only houses that were there in the ghetto on both sides.







Q: What is your memory of the organization of the ghetto? The Jewish police, the Jewish Councils?







A: I had nothing to do with the Councils, and the police, they were just standing at the post where the gates were to come in or out.







Q: But, in general, were the Jewish police nicer to the than the German police or?







A: We had no contact with the German police, because first you had to � if you had the papers to go out of the ghetto, you had to present them to the Jewish police. The Jewish police presented them to the German police, and you could go. It was like a border.







Q: But you were afraid of the Jewish police as well? A: Yeah, sure. Yes, of course. It was authority.







01:50:35







Q: And it was just authority, or was there something special about these councils and the police?







A: They had no guns and there was nothing special; there was authorities, and some of them played out the role the way they would be big heroes. If they didn't like something about you, they saw that you just coming in from the other side and you were successful to come through the German post, they took care, you know, if they wanted to let you through, if they didn't want to, they could arrest you or beat you up.







Q: And they did that?







A: They did that many times, yes, just to show authority. Q: You saw that?







A: Oh yeah, just to show authority.







Q: What other functions did the Jewish Council and the Jewish police serve?







A: I didn't see any council, but the Jewish police, I mean, this is the organized transport as I said, and groups of young boys to go to work that required to do some work for whatever the Germans wanted us to do. Like wintertime was most of all cleaning, snow shoveling for the whole day.







Q: Did you or any of your brothers or sisters do this?







A: Me and my brothers we did it, yes, we had to do it. Not in Warsaw, but outside, everybody got a � you know, off the road there is that � what you call it, trench; it was full of snow, so we had to clean it out so the water would go in. So everybody that like five hundred feet, clean it out, and you could go home.







Q: Was this outside the ghetto or inside?







A: Outside the ghetto, on the main highway. Q: So they would walk you outside?







A: They walk us outside, and we used to do our work.







Q: Okay. So what happened next? You mentioned that you went to Plonsk; how?







A: Yes but before I weren't were went to Plonsk. I told you that the orphanage was isolated.







Q: Yes.
