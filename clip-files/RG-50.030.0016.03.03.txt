Q: Do you remember, when you were in Birkenau, situations of real abuse by the people in authority?

A: Yes, I got, once I got badly abused. Q: By whom?

A: By the block�ltester, by the block�ltester. I mean he had a complaint from outside.

Apparently I stood in line twice, they were giving out, when an extra piece of bread and cigarettes, something. Sometimes they used to give out cigarettes for workers. And my couple, my foreman, gave me a name of somebody that deceased the day before, because everybody � so first I went to my name, and then I went for the other guy, say I'm him, so I could get three four more cigarettes to exchange for bread. So that there was a little boy that was working for the block�ltester or whatever, he said, �He, he was here already.� So, I start running, so I start running, and they caught me and they got my number. So the in evening after the appellthe block�ltester called out my number, and they hang me for 20 minutes by my hands like this. And I developed a bad disk there, you know. And while I was hanging they hit me on my whole body; it was pretty painful.

Q: Were you screaming?

A: Sure, I was crying. But then again, I did it again where I got away, you know. Q: Now you're � you also were working in other camps, yes?

A: Yes.

Q: Where?

A: The other camps after Birkenau was very, very hard work. First of all, it was breaking up stones with a big sledge hammer into small pieces. Once they were broken up, you had to load up trucks with them very fast. And the trucks were driven to the air strips. And after the trucks we walked toward the air strips and distributed the broken up little stones, gravel stones, nice evenly over the whole area, as much as was necessary, as a lot. And then we waited, waited for the cement truck to come. And we had to go in with the feet to the cement and were given big brooms to push the cement, even out. That was very, very hard work.

45 roll call (German).

Q: And if you couldn't do it?

A: You got beaten, you had to do it. Q: Did you see beatings a lot?

A: Yes, very much. Very much because they didn�t believe. I got beaten once again, we were building railroads and we had to carry on our shoulders the railroads. If we got even people then the load even up. Once, two � one from front of me one in back of me � were shorter than me, so the load fell on me, and I caved in, you know, and they wouldn't believe me. And I was hit, hit over the head. They thought that I'm playing games. And I told them, the guys are shorter. �Never mind, you verfluchte Jude,� It was a Belgian civilian worker that was not an inmate, he was just working for the German Kommando in that particular area, being paid, whatever, he bit me like anything, but things got � I got up, and next couple days they got little friendly with me because he saw I wore a coat. I had a coat made of good material. And inside the coat it was build in so much, and he wanted a hat � to made the hat, you know. So, there were two French tailors. He says you give them the material from inside, we going to cut it out, make a hat and get bread from him. So we made a deal, three partners, two tailors and me. I give them materials they sewed it and he got two loaves of bread and we split it up.

Q: You were building railroad tracks? A: Railroad tracks also.

Q: Was this kind of activity going on throughout your whole time there?

A: No, it was air strips and railroad tracks, air strip, railroad tracks, what else was there, that was practically it.

Q: Now, was this earlier on?

A: No, that was that was already � I think it was the last, the last that was the beginning of '45, because I remember the air raids were coming, and that was our only relief, because it was near the woods where we built this air strips, and when the Allies were coming, we were ordered to run into the woods to hide. When we run into the woods we used to grab the leaves, dried leaves from the trees, and we had the paper from the cement paper, and roll them up and we smoked just to relieve the hunger. And the planes were coming so low, you held on to, and they were British, they were the Royal Air Force we could see. We could almost see the pilot, they came down so low, because some German airplanes were sitting. They just got them on the ground and destroyed them.

03:07:20

Q: I don't want to get too far off yet, but since you are talking about it, when you saw or heard these air raids, did you think that there was some hope that you would be rescued?

A: If there was some hope, I knew a war was going on, but whether they are going to succeed, whether we are going to be liberated, that doesn't come to our mind, that didn't come to our mind.

Q: Why not?

A: The dream, we were so conditioned to it, that that's it, that's it, you know, that's it. We had one wish, enough bread before we die, because we are prepared, we; I don't say me, I was never prepared for that. Because whenever the boy ask me, �What do you think we going to survive all this?� I says me yes, you, I don't know, swear to God. I always had to positive attitude. And then I couldn't picture any liberation, any, how do you start, I don't know where my mother is, I don't know where my brothers are, I'm all alone here. I just didn't picture to resume a new life, what's it going to be, because I was kind of taken care of. Okay, I had to go to work. I had to sleep in my clothes because I was afraid to take them off, wet or dry, you know. And my feet were wet and cold all the time. It was winter time, snow, but yet, I was programmed. I got up in the morning got my little black coffee or a little piece of bread and I know lunch time came they brought the little thing, if I was lucky I got a little thick soup, if not I drink whatever I can. And then I stood in front of the German, three, four feet away made a pity face, you know, while he was peeling his potatoes and throwing the peels, I used to run, grab the peels. So, he throw me a potato sometimes, and sometimes then, just he did that [indicates grinding into ground] to the peels, nobody should get them. But always try to find some sympathy someplace, you know � throw me a potato. They were not allowed to do this, they were not allowed to. But some of them had a heart.

Q: Were there only things in the average day that come back to you that really stand out in your mind, the way you spent your days?

A: Not really, all the same, all the same, just nothing to look forward to, you know, nothing to look forward to, just.

Q: Why were these appells so difficult for people?

A: Standing those many hours with the cold, just standing and waiting. You got up in the morning, you wanted your little tea or whatever they gave you, you wanted it. Sometimes you couldn't sleep through the night because you are so hungry. In the morning they gave you the piece of bread with margarine and a little tea or coffee, whatever you wanted.

And they kept you hours and hours and hours, bad weather, rain, mud, you know. There was one German in Birkenau called SchillingerHe was so bad, he was so bad. Out of nowhere, he used to take people and he made us jump like a rabbit or roll over in the mud. So much punishment, unbelievable. One day a transport came from Poland, they told the Polish Jews, �Whoever had papers to go to United States and missed the ship, now it's time, take all your valuables and you�re going.� So people believed them. And they brought them straight to Auschwitz. And here goes this woman and this man, and he happened to be � the guy, Schillinger goes to this woman and man and have an argument with them. �Why did you fool us? You told us so and so, and you brought us.� So this Schillinger slaps the man. The woman grabs the gun and kills him, his own gun, and kills them.

Q: He killed Schillinger?

A: Yes, Schillinger. That was Yom Kipper when we heard that Schillinger got killed. I mean we prayed merciful to for God for taking him away from us.

Q: You didn't see this? A: I didn't see it.

Q: Were there reprisals? A: Excuse me?

Q: Was there sort of revenge by the Germans?

A: Oh, they took them right away, everybody � the whole transport was gassed. But this woman, you know, unbelievable.

Q: You said when you first arrived you saw Eichmann?

A: I found out later that is Eichmann, you know, that�[pointing]. Q: Did �

A: On the ramp and made the decision who lives who dies.

47 SS Staff Sergeant Josef Schillinger, successive appell leader and commander of outside squad for Auschwitz.

Auschwitz Chronicle, 1939-1945, 821.

48 October 23, 1943, a transport of 1,800 Polish Jews bearing passports for Latin America, arrived via Bergen- Belsen concentration camp in Poland. Apparently, these so-called �exchange Jews� did not realize their destination and fate until arriving on the selection platform at Birkenau. During the processing of the female prisoners, a woman grabbed Schillinger�s revolver, killed him and injured another SS officer. A riot ensued and re-enforcement�s were called who eventually subdued the women and herded them into the gas chamber. Auschwitz Chronicle, 1939-1945, 513.

Q: What was he like?

A: Serious, you know. Tall, dark and handsome. He was a nice man and he looked like a respectful man. He didn't speak, he didn't talk, just motion [pointing] with his hands, he didn't talk.

Q: So you walked out to these other places to work? A: Yes.

Q: Any particular experiences that stand out as you worked at all these other sites?

A: Well, we used to � there was a camp near Stuttgart we used to go to work every day, and we had to go to a village. And very, very often, very often, German woman used to come out and holding something in there, and waited to get okay from the SS that was accompanying us, and they used to throw out bread, piece of bread in fronts of us, or in the middle, whoever could grab it, if the soldiers give the permission, otherwise they would turn return their goods. Many of them they did allow.

Q: I wonder why?

A: Some had a heart, because the ones that watched us, they were not young soldiers, they were mens in the 60s, fathers, you know, so maybe they are � and just what � was not SS, there was the WehrmachtI don't even know the difference. I mean the SS was the closest � the most supportive to Hitler, and the other one was just like reserve. Were older men that could hardly carry their rifle.

Q: Do you think the people that you passed as you went through the villages had a clue what was going on inside?

A: If they had a clue what's going on? I don't know that they knew about the destruction, the gassing, the burning. They knew that we are inmates to do labor work for them. And when the they sad the way some of us look, and maybe some of the soldiers were talking to the wives, and the wives, you know, passed the word so they had idea that we are punished. Whether we were Jews or not, we had no idea, because everybody wear the striped uniforms, because we were never in contact with them, no close contact with the civilian population.

Q: Were you ever in any other camps for any length of time?

A: No, all of us were only short, short because Allies � but the last, by the end, again I don't 49 General title of German armed forces from 1935 to 1945. Encyclopedia of the Holocaust, s.v. �Wehrmacht.� remember the date, we were brought into Dachau one night.

Q: Let's hold on one second and let me see if there's anything else we need to cover about Birkenau. I don�t think so � pretty thorough. Anything that stands out in your mind?

A: Not really, not too bad.

Q: Other than the fact that you were there a long time, in Birkenau? A: Yes.

Q: Three, four years? A: [Nods �yes.�]

Q: It must have been have seemed endless?

A: Not Birkenau, all the camps together. Yes it was endless, it was endless. And at the end of all these little camps, we were finally brought in, at night, to Dachau.

Q: Why? A. I don't know why, it was � I guess it was the end of the trip for them, they had no place to get us any more, in Dachau we were we also were short time, few days, and then were sent on a march, you know, just walking, walking, day in and day out, and walking, walking, walking, walking and walking to nowhere. And people were falling like flies, left and right, left and right, you know, didn't know what's going on, getting a piece of bread a day, for warm weather, whatever it is, walking and walking and walking.

Q: You were walking by people in villages? A: No, no.

Q: Did anyone see you as you were walking?

A: Yeah, people were seeing, we were passing little towns, just a mass of people walking, walking and these old soldiers going, you know, creeping. And after, I don't know eight days or nine days walking, look back, the group gets smaller and smaller and smaller, and I don't even know how those people were taken away the ones that fell, you know. All of a sudden one time they tell us, �sit down for a rest period,� and the German people eat whatever they get, and then we sit, and they tell us �Okay, up, up, up aufstehenup.� And like it was a password, we refuse to go. What's the use, you know, we refuse to go.

Then the Germans get mad, they thought that we are rebelling. And they, they said, �Up, 50 get up, rise (German).

up, rouf, rouf!� I mean, up the hill, so big deal, we up the hill, then held his hands up, you know, face the trees and hands up, so we put our hands up. And then, then one officer says like �genickschuss�52means aim at the neck, you know. We hear the rifles, didn't bother anybody, and we stay and we stay, and we wait and we wait, then we hear one of the officers says, �My God, four kilometers are the Americans!� And we hold our hands, and, you know, it hurts. We look, look, look, no more German soldiers. We run down the hill, and we hear the noise of tanks, tanks, tanks coming. And we put our hands up, �Hey, hey, hey,� � didn't know, my God, liberated. The other Jews start singing the �Hatikvah�and they tell, �Us let us go, let us go.� � they spoke some German, the Americans ��Wir m�ssen gehen.� So what do we know, we let them go, they pass us by. And we all alone again, the German come back to take us. To take us and march again and again and again and again, and �

03:19:58

Q: What was going on then?

A: The Germans just passed, they wouldn't take us, they wouldn't liberate us, they just passed by. The Germans hid, they were hiding somewhere, the Americans passed by, the Germans came back. But apparently the Germans were in the occupied territory. We don't know. Then they made us turn around, like back towards Dachau, but there was a camp they name Allach. They put us in there, and I think we were there maybe a week or two. And that's where I told you where the Germans took off the uniforms and became civilian, and they started to be awful nice to us, awful nice. �Oh, we going to try to get you some barley, we are going to get some potatoes, we are going to get the soup a little thicker,� you know. And you are men at the appell, you know, we were so all of a sudden we became so confused. �Oh, you are men. Please behave, you know, like don't make us punish you or hit you,� you know, because some became very disorganized, �what the heck is going on.� A few weeks, and then all of a sudden, as I told you, the guards disappeared, you know, and again we don't know what's going on, and people go and break the gates. I wasn't even � didn't even have the strength to pick up a piece of stick, I weighed about 90 pounds. And all of a sudden some jeeps roll in with a, with a big truck with the red cross on there, you know, and some soldiers come out and shoot a gun and look and make pictures, you know. And I remember very good that there was one inmate, a German Jew, he spoke English and he says, �you bring food.� Now I know, then I didn't understand, he says �yah, yah, yah,� and went off. At that time I didn't bother looking at them, they wanted to make pictures, I say, �the hell with your pictures.� and looked and looked, and go in the truck to look for some food and I find a package and I say, �My God I got chocolate.� I like chocolate so much, and I ate the whole package of Exlax, you know, and later I get my business and get my cramps, and I woke up in the

51 Up (German).

52 Neck shot (German).

53 Hope (Hebrew); Jewish national anthem.

54 �We must go.� (German).

camp, nobody was there telling me, �yes go, no don't go,� and I went and there was this kitchen outside. I see the soldiers lined up and they�re serving beautiful white bread, and make pancakes, you know, and I start to talk to somebody. There was one soldier he was speaking Russian it was American soldiers, and he says, �What's wrong with you?� I say, �bubu, bolischmerzen.� And he took me in the Jeep, and it wasn't far away and drove me in to a town called M�hldorf and put me in hospital � new, and I got good � you know, cleaned out and the surgeon gave me farina, milk and sugar every day. And in two weeks I got [gestures to face] and I just walked out from the hospital.

03:23:40

Q: I just want to go back a little. So when the Americans came? A: Yes.

Q: Finally.

A: Yes; and I �.

Q: Do you remember how they treated you? Do you remember anything more about the scene? Where you�?

A: Well, I just told you. Didn't hate us at all. They just came in as visitors, appeared to me like visitors, you know, they just came in looked around, spoke to some civilian, you know, and that's all. And I � there, there was no treatment, didn't pay any attention to us, you know,

Q: What did you �

A: Just made pictures, I don't know, I said, �What the hell is going on, who are these people?� So they says we are free, or liberated � we are liberated. People started to sing the �Hatikvah,� and I wanted to eat, didn't get anything for three days since the Germans left. The night before we had the artilerske58 some people got killed in the barracks.

Q: The night before?

A: The night before, the father and son got hit with shrapnels. So when we they came in, they were looking around making pictures. There was nothing.

Q: Could you believe that you were free?

55 �Boo-hoo� (Polish).

56 Hurts (Polish).

57 Pain (German).

58 Artillery (Yiddish).

A: I could believe because the, the how you call, it the guards were gone. The guards were gone. And some people broke the gates, the doors were open, the gates were open. Some people got strong, they went in and out, and all of a sudden I see the inmates that were in my barracks sleeping next to me, came with � bring motorcycles in they were nice and strong motorcycles. Apparently they robbed some people, you know, but I was too sick.

Q: What � do you know what happened to the German guards, did they just disappear?

A: They disappeared, yes, the Germans disappeared. Some of the civilian remained to take care of us, just to play a role of repairing, and hoping that one of us would say a good word to the authorities, that they wouldn't imprison them or some prisoners, not to kill them, because prisoners take advantage later on Kapos and the block�ltesters. I know there was one block�ltester in Birkenau that the Ukrainian put them, and they cut him with a saw, because he was a bastard, he was bad. So prisoners, I mean inmates took revenge.

03:25:50

Q: Did you see this?

A: I didn't see this. It was just talking, you know.

Q: Do you remember approximately the date of all this; the date when you were liberated?

A: The date of liberation, it was spring, April sometimes, I know springtime, it started to get warm.

Q: What � where did you go from the hospital? You were in there a few months�

A: From the hospital, I walked out to a little town called Ampfing, and I met two boys, two Jewish boys, and I started talking to them, I just came out and �What are you doing?

What�s, what � where are you from?� �They say, well, we are from here.� And I said, �Where are you staying?� �We are going to two sisters, farmers, you know, they took us in. If you want you can come stay with us.� So I went with them, and there were two old sisters. They were so afraid that they thought that every survivor that comes in, they have to give up their life, you know. So they took care of us, all three of us. We stood there for several months. And then in that particular town, there was a camp in the forest, a camp. And they were making parts for airplanes. So we used to go there and get little motors, electric motors. We took the motors and went to a farmer in exchange for a cow or a calf, slaughtered and sold the meat to camps. Camps were established already, UNRRA camps, but they didn't get enough to eat, so we started to be in business.

59 United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration

Q: You�re a hustler!

A: Yes, started a business. Got a horse and wagon, and started the business. Then when we got sick of the little town, we says we going to go to Munich, so we go with the horse and wagon to Munich, and we go, and had already a little idea. And one of my partners had a landsman was an administrator in HIASyou know HIAS? So I do it here and there, what can we do, and he says �Well, you go and find out an apartment where a Nazi used to live and you can have that apartment.� So we found out that Nazi get a clearing order to clear in 24 hours, he had to not even take any bedding, nothing, leave everything as it is. And we got a beautiful apartment. So we took the horse and wagon back there, came up, moved into apartment, and start doing business.

Q: Who arranged for this Nazi to leave, or you just marched in?

A: German � we didn't march in, no. We asked around, �where do the Nazis live?� and Germans used to say, �Nazi used to live here, Nazi used to live here.� �You know his name?� �Yes.� So we talked the guy in the HIAS and he made an application and HIAS � the guy get an order, an eviction and had to give up the apartment. And we moved in, and then whoever came from Poland moved in with us to stay, and it was like a transit.

Q: What did you � at what point did you try to find out about your family, your brothers? A: I was looking all the time, but I was under the impression that they perished. However, this JoeJoe got liberated in Czechoslovakia, he remain in Czechoslovakia. My older brother somehow wound up now to be in Belgium, you know, from German they took him to Belgium, and me I was in Munich. I got organized, I got even a car, the first boy to get a car. Nobody could even get a car, I got a car. I registered the Palestinian embassy, and I used to drive around the doctor to the children in Palestine, I had the car, and the Rabbi used to drive around and do the weddings. And then I started to get � I got acquainted with somebody who had a connection with a Belgia consulate, not knowing that had I had a brother in Belgium. The Belgium consulate give a list of people that perished. So the men told me for 200 dollars, if anybody wants to emigrate to Belgium, we are going to make him a paper and as that man who perished, going home. So I got involved with that, you know, I made hundred dollars, he made hundred dollars. �You want to go to Belgium. Today your name is so and so, and you are going home legally with the picture.� He went to Belgium and in Belgium the HIAS took over, and made them stay until whatever, didn't know that I have a brother in Belgium. Then my brother comes from Belgium to Munich looking for me, he was on the street where I was, couldn't find me, goes back to Belgium, and somehow he got in contact with him � Czechoslovakian and Belgian and were writing to each other, and they crying over my 60 Hebrew Sheltering and Immigrant Aid Society (American).

61 Icek (Josef) Baum death, you know. While I doing business in Munich, I see one man who got approximately the same number. I say by the number we know the transport, you know, �Oh you from here, you must have been in Buna.� I say �yes.� �Do you know Icek Baum?� He say, �Sure I know him. He is in Friedlandto Czechoslovakia, I just came from there and here is the address.� He gives me address, I write a letter, came back �unknown.� The Czechs wouldn't let him out, they wanted him to remain there, they wanted him to become a citizen because he was working in electrical place. To make the story short, my brother Joe didn't want to be Czechoslovakian, he wants to join his brother in Belgium. To go to Belgium he has to go through Czechoslovakia and has to come to Germany, to the border. In Germany they meet two girls. They say, �Why don't you accompany us to,� � wherever they were��to, in UNRRA camp.� My brother says, �Okay I go.� He goes then to Munich. In Munich he meets the guy who told me about this. �You know, you have a brother here in Munich.� He says, �no way.� So the whole night I couldn't stand it, and the morning he brings me to him, you know, after years.

Then I start crying to him that the other one is dead. He says, �No he is not dead, he is in Belgium. Here's a picture.� So right away I go with this � with him and make papers.

Now we go to Belgium, who wants to be in Munich. So we make papers and I got suitcases. And the brother from Belgium comes to Munich. And then we all went to Belgium. We stayed in Belgium for a while, and the war broke out in Israel. We went to fight in 1948, me and the oldest.

Q: How did you get over there; was that easy? A: To?

Q: To Palestine.

A: To Palestine, my brother got smuggled in somehow. And I went to Marseilles. From Marseilles, the United States donated a ship, a frigate, a war ship. And they kept me from Israel again mobilized us in Marseilles. We walk on the ship prepared. We went out on sea under a Panama flag from Marseilles. And on the waters, a little Jewish fish boat came and passed the Jewish flag to us and we went into Haifa. In Haifa put in the cannons right away and out to war.

Q: So you went to Israel to fight for independence? A: Yes.

Q: Had you tried to get there legally before? Had you try to immigrate there earlier? 03:33:50 62 Fr�dlant, Czech Republic

A: No, no, no, I just went as a volunteer to fight. Q: And the same with your brother?

A: Yes, yes.

Q: And did you meet with up I with him there?

A: Yes, I meet up with him there. And then when the war ended, they had to liberate us because we were not aliyahyou know, at our request, because nobody wanted to be there; it was bad, there was no food, and I got married there and I couldn't find any occupation in the situation. Since they had to let me out, I went back to Belgium, and I applied to come to the United States or Canada. And in Belgium every day the police was chasing me, couldn't stay there, for a whole year. And I wrote a letter to Queen Victoria telling her my situation, and nobody came to Belgium to let me stay in Belgium, give me permission to work for as long as I want. At the same time, I got the permission � a permit that I was permitted to move to Canada. So 1951, I emigrated to Canada, and lived in Canada for 15 years and still wanted to come to this beautiful country and finally succeed.

Q: You wrote a letter to Queen Victoria? A: Yes.

Q: And somehow�

A: Explaining my situation. Q: � it got through?

A: Yes. I explained I have no place to go. I cannot back to Poland because of the persecution the survivors of such a Holocaust. And here I came to this wonderful country and I�m waiting to receive immigration papers. And then this Mr. � what's his name in the jus�, the palais of justice� send the police after me every day, every day where I'm going to go, because I was not legal in Belgium, because I was an alien.

Q: How long were you in Israel? A: About 14 months.

Q: Was it exciting fighting for the�?

63 Immigrant to Israel (Hebrew).

64 palais de justice; law-courts (French).

A: Sure it was it was exciting, sure. Ben-Gurioncame on our ship. I was a chef on the ship.

I had always a spoon in the pot! There was no food, it was very bad in Israel then, everything rations. But for the soldiers, we got � and I cooked for them meals. They loved it.

Q: When you got into Haifa you were fighting on land?

A: Not in on land, the Israeli navy. My brother was on land; I was in the navy, the Israeli navy.

Q: And you met were up with him in Israel?

A: Yes; I met him � I just visit him, just visiting. When I came there, he had furlough 24 hours, so he spend time with me, and then he had to go back on his camp and I was on the ship. He wanted to come on the ship too, but they never allowed two brothers in the same outfit because, God forbid, if something happens, at least one us should survive.

Q: Did your brother stay in Israel?

A: No, he came back to Belgium. He is older than Joe, he is in Canada.

Q: Now, one thing I didn't ask you about is, was religion ever important to you throughout all of this?

A: No. Believed in God, prayed to God, but you know, I had a hard time � you I used to go to � mama used to send me to chederyou know cheder? Jewish school, religious Jewish school where they had all the Rabbis? But they used to beat up on the children. If you didn't know something, "pow," or let defense down, and he hit. So I didn't want to go, I just refused to go to that. So Mama order � hired a tutor to come three times a week to the house and teach me Jewish, you know, how to pray and all that. But, he wanted one zloty, like one dollar every week, and we didn't have it, so he didn't come. So I never really learned. I know a little bit. Now I go to synagogue Friday, Saturday, just.

Q: How did you feel about being a Jew throughout all of this?

A: How I felt, I mean I wish � I used to wish I wasn't. You know, like, �Why did God want me Jew? Why did he want to punish me? Why? Look at all this. Why I was unprivileged?�

Q: You didn't necessarily look down on Jews, you just didn't like the position?

A: Yes, I wish I wasn't. I was trying to deny it, but � I could deny it but I couldn't hide it.

Q: When you look back at this long period, that you were really suffering, what do you think of that now?

A: Well, guilty, I mean why, why couldn't my mother have lived, why couldn't my beautiful three sisters have lived, my older brother, why? And then again, I put it in the hands of God, he wanted me. He wanted me to tell the story, although I'm still paying a high price for it. It's haunting me constantly. Especially that woman that took my number down. I see her so often, �take his number.�

Q: It seems throughout all of this there was some God?

A: And some sceneries that I have seen, like, for instance, in Plonsk, when they told the people to come out, out, out, so the woman tried to hide, and was hiding too, her child. So this young, young soldier about 17 years old grabbed the child out of her hands, and she was screaming and he shot her right in the mouth and threw the child down. You know, seeing all these sceneries just come back, come back to me, haunting me. The evacuation, the train rides, especially the train ride to Dachau. It wasn't an actual train, it was those little narrow on the narrow tracks, how you call this?

Q: You were in cattle cars, weren�t you?

A: Not cattle cars, there were narrow tracks and they were up and hanging in aisle like containers, with a little locomotive,67 and they were running during the night, and the whistle sounds in my ears so sad, you know, like a crying whistle. And you going to nowhere, to nowhere. And coming to the Dachau and the Germans with the dogs, you know, not where knowing the next what's going to be. So I'm free, I'm not free. Then I told you I liberated myself. In 1988 the Polish authorities tried to find whoever was in Dr. Korczak home and made anniversary celebration of 75 years of existence of the house, the building is still there, you know, that they built. So they got hold of me and my friend David, and there was another one, he moved to California, he would be a testimony. So we went to Poland; we went to Poland, and we come to Poland and people, introduce one another, comes a gentleman and he says my name is Aleksander Lewin, but in orphanage they used to call me Szura, and if there would be a hole I would fall right in. He was my Mr. Szura. He was the one that was like my father next to Dr. Korczak, you know, used to help me with my homework, come to my school, and we I mean we hugged and kissed. He didn't recognize but I show him my picture. It was � then we go into to the home and I look, and the feeling over came, came over me like the best to describe it like 67 Schmalspurbahn (narrow-gauge railway).

you have your famous toy, your famous doll, they take it away from you, they give it back but it's broken, you know. Like everybody � that commode, everybody had, with the little drawers where your toys were it's gone. Everything is different. But one thing, they assign a seat to me, you know, to sit down, and they assign me the same seat at the same table where I was when I was a child, you know, not knowingly. Unbelievable. And it was very emotional, everybody used to tell the story. But most of the people were prior to the war, prior to me, that immigrated to Israel and to Australia and to Brazil, they also came. So I was the youngest, and I remembered the most of Dr. Korczak, you know, so my stories were�. And they took us on tours to different camps. And then me and David hired a private chauffeur with a car and says I want to go a Auschwitz; I want to go to Birkenau. We had to have the courage, you know. So drive to Auschwitz, and naturally I walk in, now my memory comes. When I came to Auschwitz I was forced in. And this thing, you know, the railroad crossing that long thing was closed shut, electric wire, no way out. Here I walk in because I want to walk in. And I know on the other side is a guy waiting with a Mercedes for me, and I walk out. I'm liberated. That's why I say I didn't feel liberated when the Allies came. I walked in my free will and I walked out. And since then I feel liberated.

Q: You never felt got liberated since � A: No, because �

Q: Sort of just trapped with the memories?

A: I was just then, as I say, I came in and took over like a landlord buys a building and the tenants were there. They came and they were there; the territory was occupied and we were there. But there was no provision for us, you know, like I would understand they came in with doctors or, or Red Cross, you know, medication or some food, nothing.

Pictures.

Q: Anything else you want to add? A: Well, that's about it.
