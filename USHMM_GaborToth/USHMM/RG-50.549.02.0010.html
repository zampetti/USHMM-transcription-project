Weiss, who was at that point a citizen and I became a citizen because I married an American and I thought I better be an American, I regret it until today.</span> <span id="s20">I should have kept my Dutch passport.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: S -- was up and down with America.</span> <span id="s23">Right now I'm -- there are days when I'm very happy and very proud of America and there are days when I just wish I were Dutch.</span> <span id="s24">That has nothing to do with that.</span> <span id="s25">Anyway, 1957 I had a hearing for the citizenship and the guy said to me, “This is your chance to change your name.</span> <span id="s26">Why don't you become Linda or Marilyn?”</span> <span id="s27">Linda was because, it was of Linda Darnell or -- and many of the movie stars at that time, Marilyn was because of Marilyn Monroe.</span> <span id="s28">And I said, “I want one change.</span> <span id="s29">I want to change the “e” to an “a” from Renate, because I don't like the German ending and I want to chuck out my middle names.”</span> <span id="s30">And that's how I became Renata Laqueur.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: Now you were born in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: I was born in Brieg, Germany, which is today Poland, because the border -- after the Russians moved west, it is now near Breslau, which is Wroclaw today.</span> <span id="s33">And my grandparents were from there, it was the third or the fourth generation and I was very -- my mother all told me proudly, “You were born in your great-grandmother's bed.”</span> <span id="s34">And I was three years old when my father moved to Holland.</span> <span id="s35">That's a story in itself.</span> <span id="s36">And so I was born in November 19 and I was before Christmas in Holland and we made in Holland till -- I would say till Bergen-Belsen, so that is 1943.</span> <span id="s37">So my whole basic education, including gymnasium and -- no, and a year of study in Amsterdam, was all in Holland.</span> <span id="s38">So my mother -- my mother tongue is -- my parents spoke German and I answered in Holland, in Dutch.</span> <span id="s39">So again, like in America, where the kids are in there in English and the f -- and their parents speak either Italian or Russian or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: So what -- you're an American citizen, born in Germany, now Poland, grew up in Holland.</span> <span id="s41">What is your n -- your identity now?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: My identity?</span> <span id="s43">Only American.</span> <span id="s44">Because I've lived -- I would say -- I'm 78, so if I'm here since 1953, I've spent the greater part of my life in America and I've lived in Canada.</span> <span id="s45">And I couldn't immigrate to America because I was born in Germany and I was on the German quota, so I went on my Dutch passport, as an immigrant to Canada.</span> <span id="s46">And within nine months, the time it takes to get a baby, I had a visa to come in as an immigrant, because I hired a lawyer in Montreal.</span> <span id="s47">And the moment I hit Montreal, I got an immigration lawyer, who got me nine months later, on an immigration visa to America, because I had met my second husband and I was chasing him.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: So you were by yourself in Montreal?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: I was by myself.</span> <span id="s50">I immigrated alone and I wo-worked for a year in Montreal.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: This goes -- gives you some idea of the Dutch education.</span> <span id="s53">In a Dutch school, you grow up with four languages.</span> <span id="s54">So I had Dutch, French as a second language, German as the third, English as the fourth and a base of Latin and Greek.</span> <span id="s55">So when I got to Montreal -- I had gone to a secretarial school in Holland, because when I wanted to study, which was 1938, when I got my bachot, my what is it, the eindexamen for the gymnasium.</span> <span id="s56">My father said, “You don't study till you have a skill.”</span> <span id="s57">He was right.</span> <span id="s58">He said, “I'll send you to secretarial school for a year, you come out with French, German, English, Dutch, shorthand, bookkeeping, whatever.</span> <span id="s59">An international secretarial school.”</span> <span id="s60">I tell you, I made my life with that secretarial school.</span> <span id="s61">In Canada, later on I used this education when I studied, because I could do notes.</span> <span id="s62">I was in comparative literature in four languages, without any problem.</span> <span id="s63">So I'm very grateful, because I didn't study in Holland, but I made up for it by studying later on, 40 years later.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: I want to go back to your saying that y-your identity is as an American, because as you pointed out, you have a Dutch kitchen, you have this poster --</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: Yeah, I have d-d-d --</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: from Holland with [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: Don't forget, the older I get, you will see everywhere there's Holland.</span> <span id="s68">It's the flowers whether they're f -- they're all false, but they're from Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: The tulips.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: It is somehow the -- the remnants of some food things, of pictures, of culture.</span> <span id="s71">I've n -- I've not been back now for eight years.</span> <span id="s72">I'm going back this year for the first time again.</span> <span id="s73">But the Dutch and the American have a lot in common, I mean at least in the East.</span> <span id="s74">This feeling of being free, of talking against the authorities.</span> <span id="s75">That's very Dutch.</span> <span id="s76">And that's something I love.</span> <span id="s77">And I love the freedom of America, because I'm freer in America than I was in Holland.</span> <span id="s78">It's less provincial.</span> <span id="s79">Except right now with that whole crap with the president.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: L-Let's get back to the identity thing for a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: The or -- the identity thing.</span> <span id="s83">Your parents -- as I recall, you said in the first interview, were Jewish, but cultural or secular Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: Not only cultural, but my father -- my father was a physician, had studied and my mother was a rich girl and she was his cousin.</span> <span id="s85">They both were not raised Jewish, they had never been in a synagogue.</span> <span id="s86">The grandparents already, their parents were trying to assimilate.</span> <span id="s87">It was the time of Dreyfus in France.</span> <span id="s88">It was the time when a boy couldn't get into medical school if he was Jewish and so on and so on.</span> <span id="s89">So they got baptized I think, when they were very young, they were cousins.</span> <span id="s90">I think they were either 18 or 19.</span> <span id="s91">And so, no Jewish religion at all.</span> <span id="s92">And then comes Hitler.</span> <span id="s93">And then, he's in Holland and he's professor of medicine, pharmacology, st -- and MD, PhD and the immigrants are coming and he helps them and these were Jews who were Jews.</span> <span id="s94">Whether they were religious or not, they were marked as Jews and had to be helped.</span> <span id="s95">I have never, ever forgiven my father, it's also in my book, that in 1941, when the Germans came with this kind of … ordering people to fill in forms where they had to put in whether they had one or two or three or four Jewish grandparents, he was so fucking German, that he filled in four.</span> <span id="s96">He could have gotten by with filling in none or one and he would have gotten by and I've never forgiven him for that.</span> <span id="s97">Because this was again the -- what do you call this?</span> <span id="s98">Buckling under, because of the army, the militaries, my father was an officer in the German army in the first World War.</span> <span id="s99">This is all, incidentally, in the g -- book of my dissertation in German.</span> <span id="s100">The editor has written a t -- an, what do you call it?</span> <span id="s101">Introduction, in which he explained what my background is and my struggle with being German by … let's say, by genes.</span> <span id="s102">But not in feeling.</span> <span id="s103">And my father -- let me give you the story, because this is -- all had -- all to do with later on the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s104">My father is born in a -- in 1880.</span> <span id="s105">He marries in 1905, his cousin.</span> <span id="s106">They marry in Germany, they are both baptized.</span> <span id="s107">He is finished with medica -- medical school in Heidelberg.</span> <span id="s108">She has no profession.</span> <span id="s109">They marry in 1905, in 1912 he is called by the University of Groningen in Holland, to come as an assistant professor, because he had made his name in pharmacology.</span> <span id="s110">He is, incidentally, the guy who later on, in Amsterdam, in his laboratory, did develop testosterone.</span> <span id="s111">So he became a very famous pharmacologist and physician and whatever.</span> <span id="s112">So 1912 he goes to Groningen.</span> <span id="s113">My three older brothers and sisters are born already.</span> <span id="s114">1912 I'm not born yet.</span> <span id="s115">No, 19 f -- two were born in Germany, the third one was also not born -- was 14.</span> <span id="s116">1912, he's in Groningen, he's very happy, they have moved their two children and his wife and he is in Holland.</span> <span id="s117">The war breaks out, 1914, he volunteers -- that you should tay to a Dutch child -- he volunteers to go into the army as a medical officer.</span> <span id="s118">So he goes into the ROTC, whatever it is in Germany and what do they do?</span> <span id="s119">They stick him, because he's a pharmacologist, he's the -- in the -- occupying German army of Belgium.</span> <span id="s120">He works with the gas, with the -- what we call today, the Saddam Hussein kick ass, because as a pharmacologist, they develop…nitrogen, mustard, you name it.</span> <span id="s121">Later on I come across that again in Sloan-Kettering in '53, because the first chemo is a mustard thing.</span> <span id="s122">Anyway -- and the result of this is, although he never, ever worked on arms, that the Belgians say you get capital punishment if you ever come to Belgium after the war.</span> <span id="s123">This means that we lived in Holland already, because in nine -- let me -- I'm jumping.</span> <span id="s124">1914 is in Belgium for -- I don't know whether it was '16 or '17, I -- that I don't know.</span> <span id="s125">'18 the war is over, 1919 the Dutch want him back.</span> <span id="s126">And this time they want him in Amsterdam and they give him a professorship, a full chair pharmacology, MD, whatever and a laboratory.</span> <span id="s127">So he goes.</span> <span id="s128">He packs up -- by then his four children, Renata has been born.</span> <span id="s129">Lilo comes later, she's born in Holland.</span> <span id="s130">And -- why am I telling you this?</span> <span id="s131">And then in Holland, he -- is still 1932, he is a German citizen.</span> <span id="s132">In 1933 he becomes a Dutch citizen, with his children becoming Dutch because he wanted, he makes his money, he's there, the children are Dutch.</span> <span id="s133">It had nothing to do with Hitler, it was just before.</span> <span id="s134">And we become Dutch.</span> <span id="s135">But I was always second generation.</span> <span id="s136">So this may be also, just as I'm talking to you, why somewhere I'm more American, because this is -- was my free choice.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: You -- on the ph -- when we spoke on the phone a while back, you said that you weren't Jewish enough for the Holocaust Museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: I'm not Jewish enough for the Holocaust Museum in that sense, that I cannot even ask whether they, let's say, give me any sponsorship of any of the really Orthodox, or purely Jewish organizations, the U.G.A. or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: Do you feel Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: I've never been in a synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: Do you feel Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: No.</span> <span id="s143">If I feel anything -- and that it -- religion, and this is interesting because it comes out when I'm very sick or when there is major disaster, I pray and I was raised also in a Dutch reformed school environment, so I am basically Calvinist, but I've had Catholic boyfriends, Jewish boyfriends, so that's -- but I feel very, very, very un-Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: Do you have any spiritual practice?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: Any spiritual what?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: Practice.</span> <span id="s147">Was there an -- you said you prayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: Yeah, I pray, but with a shopping list.</span> <span id="s149">Or thankful God that I came through or that I'm still here.</span> <span id="s150">Never just pray.</span> <span id="s151">I pray with a shopping list.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: Do you --</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: God make me do this or let me have this or let it continue or discontinue, you know.</span> <span id="s154">I manipulate God.</span> <span id="s155">My --</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: Have you ever read the Bible?</span> <span id="s157">Old Testament?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: Oh yeah, I have read the Bible and the Bible, but I read the Bible more as literature.</span> <span id="s159">And as a cultural background, just as you -- you -- you read whatever, you know, in Liberal Arts.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: Y-You said that when you -- when you pray, it's -- it's to manipulate?</span> <span id="s161">Those were your words?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: I never thought of this, but I just said it.</span> <span id="s163">I don't know, you see that's a good question, why do I pray?</span> <span id="s164">Do I -- I pray of a mixture of guilt from I have to thank Him or I have to be angry or I have to do something.</span> <span id="s165">I definitely pray when I'm in trouble.</span> <span id="s166">But I also pray when I'm very happy.</span> <span id="s167">In between I forget.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: Do you --</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: I have to go to the bathroom.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: That is minesymbol 188 \f "Symbol" Did you find it?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s173">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: The coffee?</span> <span id="s175">symbol 188 \f "Symbol" What we are talking about is to my mind, cultural history.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: So I -- I want to get back to this Jewish thing for just a little bit, because so much of what happened to you, or everything that happened to you was predicated on your being Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: You mean the concentration camp?</span> <span id="s178">The concentration camp, yes.</span> <span id="s179">On the other hand, I'm not sure at all, I might have ended up in the same concen -- or in another concentration camp if I would have been plain Dutch and working in the -- what is it -- resistance.</span> <span id="s180">I don't know anybody who did not not work in the resistance.</span> <span id="s181">It's very interesting, the people of my gymnasium class, of my let's say, high school class, out of 22, 10 died -- but a percentage and this was a non-Jewish school, which means they didn't come back.</span> <span id="s182">D-Don't forget we had the Japanese occupation and the German occupation.</span> <span id="s183">At least three of, or four of my classmates were in Japanese prisoner of war, men or women.</span> <span id="s184">The other ones were either picked up because they were in the resistance -- and one other one was Jewish.</span> <span id="s185">So you see, the percentage in Holland is unbelievable, because it's not comparable to France or Denmark or Belgium.</span> <span id="s186">Because Bel-Belgium had a…military command, Denmark was somehow not very serious either.</span> <span id="s187">We had one of the very worst Nazis, Himmler-like Seyss-Inquart, who came from Austria and in many ways the Austrians were worse.</span> <span id="s188">So that was Holland.</span> <span id="s189">Holland had -- the percentage of people dying is enormous.</span> <span id="s190">And when you say the Jewishness has something to do with it, I'm not at all convinced of that.</span> <span id="s191">Because Bergen-Belsen, yes, but either Dachau or one of the female camp, Ravensbrück -- I read up on all these concentration camp because of my diary preoccupation in the dissertation.</span> <span id="s192">So the Jewishness -- and on the other hand, I also feel this has been a problem after the war was over -- that it didn't bring me closer to the whole Jewish problem.</span> <span id="s193">Because it would be naturally that I would say okay, they persecuted me, I didn't feel really part of it, but now I want to be part of it.</span> <span id="s194">I moved away from it.</span> <span id="s195">The more -- I thought about it before you came here and I thought if I add up who are my friends today and sociologically or that is -- yeah, sociologic -- where are they from?</span> <span id="s196">If you take 10 people, there are at least seven who are not Jewish.</span> <span id="s197">And this is in New York.</span> <span id="s198">A kind of, an almost -- to me it's not conscious, it's subconscious, but I avoid it carefully -- on a -- I don't know on what level, I can't -- can't even explain it.</span> <span id="s199">It has to do with friends, with relationships with men, friendships with women and it -- the really deepest involvements were with non-Jews.</span> <span id="s200">Both husbands, the first husband was baptized, is today Paul, lives in Germany.</span> <span id="s201">He married a woman who was 35 years younger.</span> <span id="s202">That is his third marriage and the second one was Dutch nobility.</span> <span id="s203">He had four children with her, the third one is 35 years younger, dee wasn't even born yet.</span> <span id="s204">He's 84 and we are corresponding, we see each other each time when I'm in Germany and we still love each other.</span> <span id="s205">We're friends.</span> <span id="s206">But he also has veered away from anything which is Jewish -- was fully Jewish born, parents were not even baptized.</span> <span id="s207">But you either go with or you do totally without.</span> <span id="s208">I have never realized it until now, when I get such interviews that I think.</span> <span id="s209">I said, “How does it tally up?”</span> <span id="s210">And I figured it out last night.</span> <span id="s211">Never thought about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: What ef-effect on your thinking --</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: The business of the ten -- ta -- take this -- this building where I live.</span> <span id="s214">There are Jewish people, non-Jewish, just on -- one or two blacks, this is today, everything is mixed, especially now on the east side.</span> <span id="s215">And when people ask me what are you -- you know, the holidays come.</span> <span id="s216">I said, “I'm nothing, but Merry Christmas.”</span> <span id="s217">Th-th-that's it.</span> <span id="s218">So there is something -- I know one thing, that if I wouldn't have any racially Jewishness, I would have been fanatically pro-Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: Because I would like to help them, because they were forever persecuted, they're forever the underdog and at the same time there are many things I don't like.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: Do you celebrate Christmas, Hanukkah?</span> <span id="s222">Neither?</span> <span id="s223">Both?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: Do you celebrate Christmas or Hanukkah?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: I celebrate Christmas, I've it -- I still have a tree.</span> <span id="s227">Now the problem is, in my own family in America, I have a sister in America, here, who -- some of the kids got married to Jews, then they got divorced and so on and so on.</span> <span id="s228">Some of them became lesbians, some of them became homo and th-the -- the all break up of families.</span> <span id="s229">But Christmas and Hannu-- in that family.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: What about Passover?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: And God forbid if you wouldn't have a Christmas tree.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: Do you relate to Passover?</span> <span id="s233">Freedom from oppression, all of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: Don't e-ed-ed -- you know that I only learned about this here?</span> <span id="s235">I never heard about it.</span> <span id="s236">And so this -- this is -- don't forget I went to school till I was, let's see, 18.</span> <span id="s237">Then I come back, then Hitler comes and somewhere I grew up with the whole German-Dutch culture of Protestantism.</span> <span id="s238">Christmas, Easter, always two days at Christmas, two days at Easter.</span> <span id="s239">You know, first day, second day.</span> <span id="s240">Jesus goes back to -- to the -- to heaven, it's two days, right after Easter, six weeks after.</span> <span id="s241">I mean all those holidays, I still have them in my head.</span> <span id="s242">So it's what you were raised into.</span> <span id="s243">And at the same time, a father who joined the German army and who dealt in gas?</span> <span id="s244">Can you imagine what that does to a…so-called Dutch child?</span> <span id="s245">And today I just tell myself -- not necessarily a war criminal.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: You said in that first interview --</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: In that first interview, you s -- when you were talking about your father joining the German army --</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: What did I say?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: You said, “I hated to be my father's daughter.”</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: Ah, yeah.</span> <span id="s252">That comes out again, my -- that's why my editor in Germany put that down and she said, she made peace with her father before he died, because I told them all of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: You still h -- sounds like you still hate being your father's daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: Yeah, because isn't the father figure some -- somebody you want to be very proud of?</span> <span id="s255">How come I married a man who was 18 years older?</span> <span id="s256">So I'm -- I'm very conflicted.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: How has the --</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: Since that time I've never had a guy who is not 20 years younger than that.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: You have a boyfriend now?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: Yeah, 25 years younger.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: Good for you.</span> <span id="s262">This guy?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: Look -- look at the picture there, with the color picture, here, o -- here, where I point.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: This one here?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: In the orange vest.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: That's California.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: No, Danish.</span> <span id="s270">But -- put it off for a second.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: Do with life, they have to do with father, with being a daughter who is trying to be obedient and being molded because he was a very, very interesting and important man.</span> <span id="s273">Short of the Nobel Prize, he had everything.</span> <span id="s274">Was a good- looking guy too.</span> <span id="s275">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: How did that influence your desire to keep learning and -- and becoming someone?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: I got even with him, in the sense of he had always said -- when I was 18 and when I wanted to go to the university in Amsterdam, he said, “What do you want to go to the university for?</span> <span id="s278">You good looking, you’re beautiful, you'll marry anywhere.”</span> <span id="s279">One of those.</span> <span id="s280">And I said, “Yeah, but I want an education.”</span> <span id="s281">And he said, “Not now.”</span> <span id="s282">So finally, in America, I was 40 exactly when I went for my BA.</span> <span id="s283">And I finished, I was 51 with a PhD, working and so on and so on.</span> <span id="s284">But only to prove I could do it.</span> <span id="s285">But politically and sociologically and genealogically, I understand and this is where I have full understanding when I'm in Germany, that people are not necessarily war criminals, if they go along with what is happening.</span> <span id="s286">And if they don't want to see what may be the dark side, because don't we all do this today?</span> <span id="s287">What gives us the right to say, “How could they?”</span> <span id="s288">I think if I -- the only thing where I think that of as unforgivable, is that they really didn't think at all, that they were just applauding and obeying and this is why I love America and this is why I love Holland, because we disobey.</span> <span id="s289">We make up our own minds.</span> <span id="s290">You have it today again.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s292">How did that influence --</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: The Clinton scandal.</span> <span id="s294">I don't care, you can put it on.</span> <span id="s295">I was absolutely devastated about two, three weeks ago when this bisery started, because I said -- I voted for Clinton and I told myself, the guy is doing everything right, I know there's something wrong sexually, but who the hell cares what he does, whether he lets his pants up or down, that's Hillary's problems.</span> <span id="s296">But then you get into the impact to the children.</span> <span id="s297">I mean, when a child says, “What's a president?”</span> <span id="s298">And you have to explain oval -- oral sex, it becomes very complicated.</span> <span id="s299">And that's where I start being ashamed of being American because this is something, it wouldn't happen in Europe.</span> <span id="s300">They would have said, “Fuck it.</span> <span id="s301">It's his problem.”</span> <span id="s302">Mrs. Mitterrand, even the scandal in Britain, when they had the minister who had to leave -- that's years ago, because he had an affair, so what?</span> <span id="s303">But not a president.</span> <span id="s304">So.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: Y-You mention often, your kind of independence, your chutzpah, manipulative, t-to use your words.</span> <span id="s306">How do you think that influenced your ability to get through all those situations that you found yourself in?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: Oh that -- that has nothing to do with m-my father.</span> <span id="s308">I think children are the -</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: No, I don't mean from the father, I mean that you have, you talk about the independent spirit of the Dutch and the Americans and that's what you relate to.</span> <span id="s310">In your first interview, you talk a lot about, you know, your -- your chutzpah, you're -- you know, if I don't get this out of you, I'm going to dunk you underwater and you scream back, “Well, how can I talk if I'm underwater?”</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A: Yeah, th-th-that's right -- right -- right -- right.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: How much do you think that has to do --</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: It's also realism.</span> <span id="s314">I mean, common sense.</span> <span id="s315">You s-- maybe that's also partially Dutch, they are very down to earth, very much down to earth and below the belt.</span> <span id="s316">So the functional thing, and you have to somehow -- there is the puncturing of pomposity.</span> <span id="s317">Let's say we all are terribly emotional and happy or not happy or we blow ourselves up and be, w-we want to be this and we want to be that.</span> <span id="s318">There is something in the Dutch and in the education, where they have a beautiful word for it, is aansteller.</span> <span id="s319">Which means you pretend to be something.</span> <span id="s320">And the Dutch come with a pin and the balloon is kaput.</span> <span id="s321">They puncture all this and that is survival also.</span> <span id="s322">So if -- and if the Germans scream and rant and rave and obey gehoorzaam, you have to be -- like my father did, you have to obey the rules, the military, you know, the whole business, the humpa.</span> <span id="s323">We laughed as kids.</span> <span id="s324">We said, “What's the matter with those guys?</span> <span id="s325">Why can't they walk normal, why can't they behave normal?”</span> <span id="s326">And that's survival.</span> <span id="s327">That helped me.</span> <span id="s328">Besides, it also helps if you're good looking.</span> <span id="s329">I was good looking.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: Still are.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: But I don't know, is that so way -- is that something special?</span> <span id="s332">To be -- it has also something to d-- it has nothing to do with humility, but maybe it has something to do, gee whiz, I'm not that important.</span> <span id="s333">What's important is I do not want to be pushed around and stepped upon and be destroyed.</span> <span id="s334">That is crucial.</span> <span id="s335">It came back in the cancer, in my treatment.</span> <span id="s336">It came back in the whole business of you do this or that.</span> <span id="s337">I said, “I won't do anything unless I understand it.”</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: You've had a number of illnesses.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: And this today, is medicine.</span> <span id="s340">The attitude of the patient, which helps or not helps, but you have to argue.</span> <span id="s341">Do you agree with me, by the way?</span> <span id="s342">Put it off for a second symbol 188 \f "Symbol" Do you understand why I had five hours with Joan?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: You're a good talker.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: She -- at that time -- five hours and 15 minutes video.</span> <span id="s345">What you saw is only part of it.</span> <span id="s346">Joan was incredible, she asked things which -- to give you one example, when she said, “Why did you write a diary?</span> <span id="s347">When did you write?”</span> <span id="s348">I suddenly came up with this answer, “Because I traveled.”</span> <span id="s349">Just as suddenly, I realized last night, when I told myself, “What am I going to tell Karen?</span> <span id="s350">How do I stand in this and this and this?”</span> <span id="s351">And then I came up with those, out of 10 friends, seven or eight are non-Jewish.</span> <span id="s352">So there is all these things come out from.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: How has that first interview affected you, now that you look back on it?</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A: It doesn't affect me at all.</span> <span id="s355">By now nothing can happen to me any more.</span> <span id="s356">All I want to do is stay on top and stay alive and not end up as a homeless person.</span> <span id="s357">So I'm trying to have too much -- th-th-the money I have goes -- that's why I asked you whether you have children -- the money goes to my nephew and nieces and they will say, “I wished she would have spent a little more on herself.”</span> <span id="s358">But the hell with it.</span> <span id="s359">I do my -- my best.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: But has -- has that first interview, where you were asked to remember certain things, helped you remember in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: How what?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: Has it helped you remember other things?</span> <span id="s363">Having been asked those questions before?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: The question of whether I -- what helps to remember or --</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: Yeah, if -- if having that first interview with Joan has prompted you to remember more things since then?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s367">And the reason why I protested against having another interview, I think that interview with Joan, I have the tape and the interesting thing is only two -- three parties of my friends have seen it, none of my family.</span> <span id="s368">I will not show it to my sister, I will not show it to her children because she would fight me.</span> <span id="s369">She would say, “That's your problem with Daddy,” or this or whatever or this isn't quite so -- I -- which is okay, I would fight it, but she said, “Why do you say that?”</span> <span id="s370">And I don't feel that at my age, when I was with Joan I was 76, I don't have to defend anything I do.</span> <span id="s371">Certainly not with my family.</span> <span id="s372">But I see it my way and their way is different.</span> <span id="s373">And I don't want any arguments.</span> <span id="s374">So the people who have seen it are close friends and I have no VCR, so I can't even see it.</span> <span id="s375">I refuse to have all that gadgetry.</span> <span id="s376">I have no time to read and I've only a television and not even a computer.</span> <span id="s377">No e-mail, no nothing.</span> <span id="s378">No fax.</span> <span id="s379">It's fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: In -- in that first, in -- you wrote a letter to Joan afterwards that you t -- where you mentioned the -- and I'm not going to get the words right, repressed memories that came out from doing that interview, repressed --</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: The what?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: Repressed and buried memories.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: I have all that stuff here.</span> <span id="s384">If you want me to I can look it up, there's --</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: No, that's okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: No, but -- depressed memories --</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: These are repressed.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: Re?</span> <span id="s389">Oh, repressed.</span> <span id="s390">Constantly.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: Repressed and buried memories.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: You see repression works -- that's another thing.</span> <span id="s393">If I meet people, let's say when I meet Paul in Germany or when I'm at my sister in Boston, she remembers things in a different way from I do and when I talk and then she says, “Don't you remember this?”</span> <span id="s394">I said, “I have not the vaguest idea what you're talking about.”</span> <span id="s395">I have honestly repressed it.</span> <span id="s396">There are so many things where I know that I don't remember a single name.</span> <span id="s397">How often do I run into people who ask me, “Did you know Anne Frank?”</span> <span id="s398">That's the first thing they ask.</span> <span id="s399">Did you know this or this or that?</span> <span id="s400">I said, “There were thousands of people.</span> <span id="s401">I've seen thousands of corpses.</span> <span id="s402">Maybe 500 living people, versus 10,000 corpses.</span> <span id="s403">I can't tell you what anybody looked like.</span> <span id="s404">It's all gone.”</span> <span id="s405">And it comes back in -- any time when I'm in Germany, when I'm walking in Bergen-Belsen or where I am -- I said the first time I was back, when we walked over the -- they say the grounds of Bergen-Belsen, I said, “I'm walking on my grave, I should have been dead.</span> <span id="s406">I should have been one of those here.”</span> <span id="s407">There's no guilt feeling, many people have guilt, I no -- I'm just glad.</span> <span id="s408">That's where I say, “Thank God.”</span> <span id="s409">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning of Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: How do repressed things come out?</span> <span id="s411">When you least expect them.</span> <span id="s412">There's something which triggers it, either a question, or a smell or a meeting, or whatever and suddenly it all comes back.</span> <span id="s413">And I have really, strangely enough, no problem with that, because if I don't want to think about it, I'm like Scarlett, I say, “I'll never be hungry again,” and I won't think about it.</span> <span id="s414">I just know I will never be hungry or dirty again.</span> <span id="s415">I'd rather die.</span> <span id="s416">And that I have lived by.</span> <span id="s417">These are my two tenets, Scarlett.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: What are your favorite foods?</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: What are you favorite foods?</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: Light.</span> <span id="s422">Everything without fat.</span> <span id="s423">Salads, berries, the hell with it?</span> <span id="s424">Cookies, but only one or two and then I can eat a jar of cookies and then not eat them for a year.</span> <span id="s425">Favorite foods, light, fresh, clean.</span> <span id="s426">And never, ever fat.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: I already screamed as a child.</span> <span id="s429">When I got older, whipped cream as a -- with a German mother and a German grandmother and a Kuchen mit der Schlagsahne and the coffee with the Schlagsahne and the gravy which was -- had little eyes on it, you know, the thing.</span> <span id="s430">And I was screaming.</span> <span id="s431">I had an aversion against fat.</span> <span id="s432">What do I end up with?</span> <span id="s433">Colon cancer, hypercholesterolemia.</span> <span id="s434">Genetic.</span> <span id="s435">I can only tell you it had nothing to do with anything, but I still have the aversion.</span> <span id="s436">And I remember in Holland, I hated the butter and the cheese.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: Are there --</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: But I wanted the peanuts and the fresh vegetables.</span> <span id="s439">I didn't know there was such a thing as light milk, didn't exist.</span> <span id="s440">We didn't have any idea what good food was.</span> <span id="s441">We always had heavy stuff.</span> <span id="s442">Think of your mother's kitchen.</span> <span id="s443">Think of Easter, of Christmas, of Hanukkah, whatever you want to do, all that stuff.</span> <span id="s444">Iß, mein Kind, eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: Do you cook?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: Do you cook?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: I love it.</span> <span id="s449">If I -- if I can cook quick.</span> <span id="s450">I don't want to spend time in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s451">But I'd -- I like to cook if I can stay -- stay away from the recipe.</span> <span id="s452">I get the idea and then I start.</span> <span id="s453">Then I have no idea and then occasionally I write it down.</span> <span id="s454">And then I do something else.</span> <span id="s455">It's the same where as this one.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: In --</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: I draw, I write, I cook, I do everything, because the whole family is artistic.</span> <span id="s458">This is my mother's painting, this is my brother's painting, it's all over.</span> <span id="s459">Psychiatrists, psychologists, this is my sister's painting.</span> <span id="s460">Everybody paints.</span> <span id="s461">And I draw only when I'm on vacation.</span> <span id="s462">Only architecture.</span> <span id="s463">So -- and this I did out of anger.</span> <span id="s464">I came for the first time from Italy, in 1959, in Venice and we needed a coffee table and I wanted to do what I had seen in Venice, these beautiful, beautiful colors.</span> <span id="s465">And my husband said, “You know what?</span> <span id="s466">Do your thing.”</span> <span id="s467">I said, “I'll make a coffee table.”</span> <span id="s468">He said, “How do you do that?”</span> <span id="s469">I said, “We go buy glass, we go buy things.”</span> <span id="s470">And I smashed the glass.</span> <span id="s471">I got rid of my aggression and we put it in together and I made sure that it wouldn't be concentric.</span> <span id="s472">And then I got a little Chinese who helped me to put it together and he said, “That's it.”</span> <span id="s473">And I've done this ever since.</span> <span id="s474">So, if you ask me what I like to do, I like to improvise.</span> <span id="s475">Studies the same way.</span> <span id="s476">I went to NYU Columbia, to get a degree, so I would be able to talk Spanish, because he'd been in Cuba and we had Spanish friends and I ended up, because of my course work, in Irish literature.</span> <span id="s477">I ended up with comparative literature and that's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: And then you went on to do more studies.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: Then you went on to do more studies, after?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: Well, I had to do -- da -- da -- now comes -- now comes, how did I get to the dissertation?</span> <span id="s482">And this is, of course, part of this whole thing, because you see, how come, if your life was so different in America.</span> <span id="s483">I was married to a psychiatrist, we didn't have much money because he had divorced and I didn't have the money yet, which would come free from Holland, only much later.</span> <span id="s484">And we were doing things in a very frugal way, but we had a lot of fun in New York.</span> <span id="s485">New York in the 50's was great.</span> <span id="s486">You could go to the theater for four dollars and to the movie for 50 cents.</span> <span id="s487">We went in the afternoon to the movies, in the evening to the theater, so that was fine.</span> <span id="s488">Butsymbol 188 \f "Symbol" in 1965, the diary I'd kept in -- in the camp, was published in Holland, as a paperback.</span> <span id="s489">And a friend of mine took care of that and she went to a good Dutch publisher and that was it and when I studied at NYU -- I don't know whether it's on the first tape, I don't think so.</span> <span id="s490">When I studied at NYU, it was between '60 and '71.</span> <span id="s491">Already, before the BA, I realized I don't want to have anything really to do with Spanish, I want English literature.</span> <span id="s492">Because it was a foreign literature for me.</span> <span id="s493">It opened up vistas.</span> <span id="s494">And my American lit professor said, when I wrote papers, he said, “Renata, you write well, have you ever written anything?”</span> <span id="s495">I said, “Sure.</span> <span id="s496">I wrote stories in Holland and I wrote for women's magazine and I always liked to report things.</span> <span id="s497">And I have a diary.”</span> <span id="s498">He said, “What kind?”</span> <span id="s499">I said, “A Dutch diary in Bergen-Bel --.”</span> <span id="s500">He said, “Ey?</span> <span id="s501">Anne Frank?”</span> <span id="s502">I said, “No Anne Frank.”</span> <span id="s503">I said, “I wrote in a camp and it is in Dutch and it's published.”</span> <span id="s504">He said, “Can I read it?”</span> <span id="s505">I said, “If you can read Dutch, you can read it.”</span> <span id="s506">He said, “Will you translate it?”</span> <span id="s507">I said, “Why would I?”</span> <span id="s508">It was 1963 or something.</span> <span id="s509">And he said, “Do me a favor, translate it.</span> <span id="s510">I'll get you somebody to help you with it, from NYU, a graduate student.</span> <span id="s511">You dictate and he puts it in a typewriter.”</span> <span id="s512">We didn't have a computer at that time.</span> <span id="s513">So I dictated and he did it and I still have that, I have the manuscript.</span> <span id="s514">It's still bad English because my English wasn't as good, was 25 years -- 30 years ago.</span> <span id="s515">Anyway, he tried at that time to get it to publishers.</span> <span id="s516">He tried everyone, from the biggies to the small ones, from Random House to everywhere and they all said, “It's not sexy enough, not violent enough, understated.</span> <span id="s517">It's Hemingway-like understated.”</span> <span id="s518">So nothing happened, forgot about it.</span> <span id="s519">Then comes the dissertation, where my husband says on a beach in Turkey, when I say I want to write the dissertation, 1969, about the aviator in literature or the doctor in literature.</span> <span id="s520">He said, “Are you crazy?</span> <span id="s521">You're never going to get finished.</span> <span id="s522">Why don't you take your diary and find other diaries.</span> <span id="s523">You know they were written.</span> <span id="s524">Get a fellowship, do it.”</span> <span id="s525">I did.</span> <span id="s526">Got it in a year and a half.</span> <span id="s527">So this is how the diary and then the -- the diary -- the di -- dissertation was done, he dies.</span> <span id="s528">To my mind, he -- his death came earlier and I felt very guilty about it, because I had been totally absorbed for two years in getting this stuff out of the way.</span> <span id="s529">And that's when you said to me, my husband didn't take to it too much when I went back to school.</span> <span id="s530">Deso fully understood my total dedication, was completely wrapped up with it himself, read everything I wrote, criticized very constructively, but was dead tired of the whole stuff, because I was -- I had also been in Germany in between and of course did whole stuff to digest that.</span> <span id="s531">I defended my dissertation in May 1971.</span> <span id="s532">He was dead 19th of November, '71.</span> <span id="s533">That meant -- he had congestive heart failure, he had smoked himself to death.</span> <span id="s534">And he kind of gave up.</span> <span id="s535">And that's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: What was your second husband's name?</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: Till '71 November, he died at New York Hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: Deso, he was D-D-Deso-Desiderio Weiss.</span> <span id="s540">Anyway --</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: Beautiful name.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: Middle name?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: No, b-beautiful name, does it re--</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: Yeah, okay, he was Desiderio and I was Renata, so the one was the wished for, the other one was the reborn one, so when he met me, he said, “My God, I always wanted to meet a Renata.”</span> <span id="s545">I said, “I never wanted to meet a Desiderio.”</span> <span id="s546">But whatever.</span> <span id="s547">This story I have to tell and I think this should be on tape.</span> <span id="s548">How did I meet him after the war?</span> <span id="s549">It's not on the f -- on the tape in --</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: I wanted to ask you about these things, so good, let's go ahead with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: Yeah, but now I'm going to tell you.</span> <span id="s552">And I leave out all the -- the titillating things, I just leave in the fact, it's good enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: Titillation is fact.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: I -- I married -- I married, since 1941, to Paul, who was my buddy, five years older, we had a wonderful relationship.</span> <span id="s555">He was the first man for me and we come back from the concentration camp, as he says today, I know I saved his life, so he is totally grateful and happy and whatever, we are good friends.</span> <span id="s556">Our marriage was on the rocks, because I don't know, I said this already on the tape, but I'm saying it again, I don't know any marriage which survived the concentration camp if they both were there.</span> <span id="s557">Because they grew apart.</span> <span id="s558">Same thing with prisoners of war in Japan and even Vietnam, I know all these things happen.</span> <span id="s559">Paul and I grew apart, he married, I remarried, how did I remarry?</span> <span id="s560">In 1950, I'm his wife and I write stories and I help him with his practice, he was a speech therapist and I'm a housewife.</span> <span id="s561">And I'm pretty happy.</span> <span id="s562">We had had a child, the child died.</span> <span id="s563">He had a girlfriend, I had boyfriends.</span> <span id="s564">We lived a very much after the war life, growing apart and still together.</span> <span id="s565">In 1950, in July, he tells me, “We have an international congress of speech pathology, why don't you work for that?”</span> <span id="s566">And I became the sec -- the treasurer for that, big deal.</span> <span id="s567">In August 1950, the treasurer of that international convention comes from New York and my husband Paul tells me, “He is the guy you should have married.</span> <span id="s568">Because I met him when I studied in Vienna before the war.”</span> <span id="s569">He had studied with him, speech pathology and whatever.</span> <span id="s570">And he said, “He is older than you, but this is exactly what you should have m -- cause you should have ne-never married me, we know that.”</span> <span id="s571">I said, “Okay, I'm not going to marry him, I'm -- I'm not going divorcing you.</span> <span id="s572">I'm okay.”</span> <span id="s573">A week later I asked him for a divorce.</span> <span id="s574">I said, “You're absolutely right, this is the guy I'm going to marry.</span> <span id="s575">He doesn't know it yet.</span> <span id="s576">I know I'm going to marry him.”</span> <span id="s577">Ah, let's see.</span> <span id="s578">I went with the guy to Paris, with the -- with my second husband and it was a wildly beautiful affair, 18 years older.</span> <span id="s579">And he said, “I'm married, I have no children, a very unhappy marriage.”</span> <span id="s580">I said, “I know.”</span> <span id="s581">I knew that already from Paul, from Vienna, from 1936.</span> <span id="s582">He had said, “He has a very unhappy marriage.”</span> <span id="s583">And so on.</span> <span id="s584">He said, “I love you, but we will never, ever get together because I live in New York, I have no money.</span> <span id="s585">I have to restudy, do my medicine over again.</span> <span id="s586">I have -- I'm only beginning and my wife will never let me go.”</span> <span id="s587">I said, “Leave it to me.</span> <span id="s588">I'm immigrating.”</span> <span id="s589">That's how I got to Canada, that's how I got to America.</span> <span id="s590">I divorced Paul, 1950.</span> <span id="s591">I said -- he had a girlfriend.</span> <span id="s592">I went to his girlfriend and I said, “I'm leaving.</span> <span id="s593">I'm going to Canada.</span> <span id="s594">Please marry Paul, he can't be alone.”</span> <span id="s595">She said, “I won't marry a Jew.”</span> <span id="s596">I said, “You can live with him and you can be your boyfriend and you won't marry him?”</span> <span id="s597">She said, “My family wouldn't let me.”</span> <span id="s598">I said, “He's not a Jew, he's baptized.”</span> <span id="s599">Any – could we go over this, she married him, they have four children.</span> <span id="s600">This is the Paul who then married the German girl.</span> <span id="s601">I went to America.</span> <span id="s602">My second husband we -- for a year we corresponded because I couldn't get, til about '52, out of Holland.</span> <span id="s603">It took me that long, the immigration, to get out, to wind up everything and in between he had come once, on borrowed money.</span> <span id="s604">He had borrowed money from my brother because he didn't have money.</span> <span id="s605">And we met in Amsterdam and in Switzerland and in Paris again and he went home in 1951 and he said, “We'll never see each other.”</span> <span id="s606">I said, “Leave it to me.”</span> <span id="s607">I immigrated.</span> <span id="s608">I was a year in Montreal, I came to New York and it took us four years to get married.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: When you were in Montreal, did you see each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: He came.</span> <span id="s611">I couldn't come back and he came every four, five weeks and I lived at the “Y”.</span> <span id="s612">So.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: Why did it take four years?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: His wife wouldn't give him a divorce.</span> <span id="s615">We'd made the usual mistakes, I had written him beautiful, explicit letters.</span> <span id="s616">The typical story, he -- she had found them before the jacket went to the cleaners and she said, “I'll run her out of the country, if she ever comes in.</span> <span id="s617">This is moral turpitude.”</span> <span id="s618">It was also the McCarran time.</span> <span id="s619">I had trouble already coming in because I had signed something in Europe, which had something to do with the Picasso peace movement.</span> <span id="s620">So this would be today, let's say, the peaceniks, that would have been something like in the 60's here.</span> <span id="s621">There were problems, politically.</span> <span id="s622">They --</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: Talk about that a little bit more.</span> <span id="s624">So you were a political activist before you --</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: I was a political activist in Holland.</span> <span id="s626">I was always a liberal, I always wanted to be -- I-I made up for the lost time in the concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: So, what'd you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: Be liberal, vote for the right people, help people, think about it, do things.</span> <span id="s629">I always did, I still --</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: So -- so were you working at the time as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: I was working, I was --</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: Doing what?</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: I worked in an office, I wrote stories for women's magazines.</span> <span id="s634">I don't know, I was a young, active person.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Q: You were in Amsterdam, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s636">A: In Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s637">Montreal -- in Montreal I went to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: But are y-you --</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: I went to McGill.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: Okay, wait a second, you're brushing over this and this is really interesting to me, okay?</span> <span id="s641">So you were writing stories for women's magazines?</span></p> <p><span id="s642">A: For women's magazine and what I usually wrote about was either love story or -- oh I forgot, I was a fashion reporter.</span> <span id="s643">I won a Vogue prize, first prize Vogue, 1949.</span> <span id="s644">That is something I'm more proud of than the PhD.</span> <span id="s645">1949, there is a competition.</span> <span id="s646">Combine a wardrobe for -- for a woman from 18 to 80.</span> <span id="s647">You can only have 10 pieces.</span> <span id="s648">And send us that and this was Vogue International.</span> <span id="s649">And I told myself, that's something I've been doing my whole life.</span> <span id="s650">So you combine the bottom, with the top, with the middle, with the upper, with the evening, with the middle, with the s -- beach, whatever.</span> <span id="s651">I had 10 pieces and I put them on a postcard, I drew them.</span> <span id="s652">One goes with one-A, 10 goes with this.</span> <span id="s653">I got number one prize from the Vogue and this was the paper in Holland, let's say the New York Times of Holland.</span> <span id="s654">And I got the first prize and I said, “What's the prize?”</span> <span id="s655">She said, “We want you to report the fashion shows when they come to Amsterdam.”</span> <span id="s656">That was Dior at the time, the new look, '47, '48, nine.</span> <span id="s657">And we will send you to Paris and you can have a dress and you can have perfume and you can have this and become a fashion reporter.</span> <span id="s658">So I did this for a year.</span> <span id="s659">And I had a press card, so when I went to Montreal, I still had a press card.</span> <span id="s660">So this is how I got into fashion and the fashion has remained with me, in a way that I'm still very interested, but I've never done anything.</span> <span id="s661">But it was again the competitive spirit.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q: How so?</span> <span id="s663">You wanted to win, or?</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: What I really -- what I always forget to tell -- in 1938, when I had my gymnasium, classical, nothing.</span> <span id="s665">I want to either study or become a fashion designer.</span> <span id="s666">And I said, I told them this in the -- in -- I think in -- in Washington.</span> <span id="s667">In refar to my father, “I want to go to Paris, I want to become a designer.”</span> <span id="s668">He said, “My daughter is not a whore.”</span> <span id="s669">Just like that.</span> <span id="s670">Meine Tochter ist keine Hure.</span> <span id="s671">“You do not go to Paris.</span> <span id="s672">You can study after you've been to secretarial school.”</span> <span id="s673">I also had another year of schooling.</span> <span id="s674">I learned to be a teacher.</span> <span id="s675">So I had -- I had all kinds of what I call skilled schools.</span> <span id="s676">And the fashion was always somewhere in my mind and in Bergen-Belsen, in the diary I have fashion drawings.</span> <span id="s677">And when they published the diary in Germany now and the book about the diary, there was an exposition in Bergen-Belsen where they took the drawings of the camp inmates and they asked me permission, “Can we put those fashion drawings?”</span> <span id="s678">I said, “Do what you want to, I don't care.”</span> <span id="s679">So they magnified them and they enlarged them and they're in Bergen-Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Q: What were you w --</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: The fashion doodles.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: Okay, but what were you wearing in Bergen-Belsen at the time you were doing these?</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: What was I wearing?</span> <span id="s684">An overall, an old sweater and lipstick.</span> <span id="s685">This is survival and I think I said this in -- maybe I said it in Washington, but I may -- may not have said it.</span> <span id="s686">When the Germans arrested me on the 18th of February, 1943, they took me to jail and you said, “You have -- you can pack something and you can take something,” so I said to Paul -- Paul wasn't arrested.</span> <span id="s687">I said, “I'll take the best sweater I have, I take perfume and I take my lipstick.”</span> <span id="s688">He said, “Are you crazy?”</span> <span id="s689">I said, “Leave it to me.”</span> <span id="s690">I always had lipstick.</span> <span id="s691">I traded in the perfume for food in Bergen-Belsen, I traded always something.</span> <span id="s692">But the lipstick and it has been ever since, it is protest against my father.</span> <span id="s693">When, in 1937, the year before I graduated gymnasium high school, I was at the wedding of my oldest brother, who married a Catholic girl from Brabant.</span> <span id="s694">Was a beautiful, Catholic wedding.</span> <span id="s695">And I had a dress which was eh, something I didn't like, but you know, teenage stuff.</span> <span id="s696">And I had my first lipstick on.</span> <span id="s697">My father walked across the hall in that hotel where the reception was.</span> <span id="s698">He came with his napkin.</span> <span id="s699">He spit on the napkin and he wiped off my lipstick, in public.</span> <span id="s700">“My daughter doesn't wear lipstick.”</span> <span id="s701">So the lipstick fixation came from something.</span> <span id="s702">I know where things come from.</span> <span id="s703">And that's not repressed.</span> <span id="s704">So there's the lipstick.</span> <span id="s705">Basta.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: When you drew these, when you made these drawings of fashion, what kind of fashions were you drawing?</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: What kinds of fashions were you drawing?</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: What I was drawing was always sporty stuff, it was always what I would say Calvin Klein-like.</span> <span id="s710">It was understated, always combinable.</span> <span id="s711">Nothing -- nothing romantic.</span> <span id="s712">Very wearable.</span> <span id="s713">So something -- I have suits which are -- I have cashmere sweaters which are from Liberty 1971.</span> <span id="s714">They're indestructible.</span> <span id="s715">Because I don't believe in anything which is high fashion.</span> <span id="s716">It has to fit the person, it has to fit the circumstances and it must be wearable at all times.</span> <span id="s717">Then it's fashion.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Q: It seems --</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A: I hate diamonds.</span> <span id="s720">Love pearls</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Q: You have a beautiful ring on.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: It is, it's beautiful.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: Yeah, okay, that's my so-called wedding ring.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: What do you mean so-called?</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: It's not a wedding ring, it's nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: From which -- which marriage?</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: Second marriage.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: Why do you still wear it?</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: Why do you still wear it?</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: I didn't -- I didn't -- I bought it in Holland, in 1970, just after I had come back -- the other one had broken, I had a gold band, which I can't wear any more anyway, it's a plain gold band.</span> <span id="s733">In Holland, in 1970, I had just come back from Munich.</span> <span id="s734">I'd worked on the dissertation.</span> <span id="s735">I saw in a store in Holland, this ring and I told myself, we have never had the money, we have never done any fancy stuff.</span> <span id="s736">Let me buy the ring and show it to Deso when I come home, whether he like it.</span> <span id="s737">It wasn't expensive.</span> <span id="s738">He loved it.</span> <span id="s739">He said, “It's your wedding ring.”</span> <span id="s740">I said, “But you didn't buy it.”</span> <span id="s741">He said, “You bought it, because I wasn't there.”</span> <span id="s742">That's the wedding ring.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: Do you think --</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A: It's not a wedding ring.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: Do you think of yourself as a very sentimental person?</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: Notsymbol 188 \f "Symbol" no, it's strange that you say sentimental.</span> <span id="s747">I think I'm more faithful than sentimental.</span> <span id="s748">I believe in continuation, in continuity.</span> <span id="s749">And it's funny that you asked that question, I have never thought about it.</span> <span id="s750">What I'm saying is what I'm really thinking.</span> <span id="s751">Continuity in a life which has been a constant fight against chaos.</span> <span id="s752">And remains a life against cha -- fight against chaos.</span> <span id="s753">We talked about God and praying, what I mainly pray for or am thankful for is continuity.</span> <span id="s754">If you come out of a concentration camp, if you come out of metastatic colon cancer, third degree, at an institute like Sloan-Kettering and you have a year of chemo and you can only take five months of this crap because the side effects are too bad.</span> <span id="s755">And if you then come back and struggle and are almost better than before, that's continuity.</span> <span id="s756">And sentimental, yes I am.</span> <span id="s757">Because when John Glenn decided or Clinton decided that John Glenn, whatever -- whatever plays up, will be in space this year, I got sentimental.</span> <span id="s758">I felt, hey, this is great, I was there.</span> <span id="s759">And I saw that and I was really grown up when he was doing that.</span> <span id="s760">It was 1960 -- whatever it was, '69 was the moon, so this must have been '62 or three.</span> <span id="s761">So I was just studying and now Glenn, who was my same age, one year younger, is going into space, then I tell myself, he's doing the impossible.</span> <span id="s762">That's continuity.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: The way you describe contin --</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: That's sentimental.</span> <span id="s765">That is pure sentimental because it has nothing to do with anything.</span> <span id="s766">It's just a sentiment that I admired the guy.</span> <span id="s767">I didn't particularly like him as a politician, but I liked him as an astronaut.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Q: The way you describe continuity sounds more like what someone else would call survival.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: Yeah but, is survival really -- you see, the trouble with survival is I'm not only talking about physical, because when I mentioned the physical, it's not too -- of course the cancer and I mentioned concentration camp, it's the physical, but I'm also talking about mental survival, spiritual survival.</span> <span id="s770">The mere fact of those, that's why I'm so bitter about the publication.</span> <span id="s771">The fact that there were people who had the spiritual resistance, defiance, to write under these circumstances, that to me is continuity, that to me is c-- survival, but that should be published.</span> <span id="s772">And so what, so if Anne diary -- writes diary while she is hiding, the danger is there, but it's not the danger of a concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: Why did you decide to kind of come out, in effect, with the diary an-and traveling and speaking--</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: Why did I decide to come out?</span> <span id="s775">I had the diary, I'm an orderly person, I decided I p -- put this all together, I never thought of publication, never.</span> <span id="s776">Just as Paul had a notebook about -- he was doing speech therapy in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s777">He had this notebook with him and the most unhappy thing which happened to him was not that he came out weighing 80 pounds instead of 200, but that that notebook was gone.</span> <span id="s778">He is still talking about it, I just saw his interview in Germany.</span> <span id="s779">He's still unhappy about the notebook.</span> <span id="s780">So if I would have lost my notebook, I would have been quite unhappy.</span> <span id="s781">I had given my time, my sleeping time, my energy to this thing.</span> <span id="s782">Why did I take it out?</span> <span id="s783">It was with me.</span> <span id="s784">If I had tried to keep it from bed to bed and straw mattress or wood -- wooden bunk or barrack to barrack, why wouldn't that put it in my wherever.</span> <span id="s785">It was this thick.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: But y-you held onto it for some time before you decided to make it public.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">A: I held on to it -- no, I gave it immediately, the same summer, as I was stuffing myself with food, getting fat, really fat.</span> <span id="s788">I was fat til I was 40.</span> <span id="s789">That's another story.</span> <span id="s790">I come back in July, I need to eat, I need to sleep, I need to screw, I need to do everything normal.</span> <span id="s791">And Paul says, “Why don't you write -- type up that diary, because nobody can read your thing.”</span> <span id="s792">I said, “Why not?</span> <span id="s793">Nothing better to do.”</span> <span id="s794">So I sat in the garden of my parents home, at the beach house in Holland and I typed.</span> <span id="s795">And I typed the manuscript and then I decided, “Why do I type it, I give it to the war documentation, what is the U.S. Holocaust Museum in Holland, and that's where it sat.</span> <span id="s796">And then something happened.</span> <span id="s797">Yes.</span> <span id="s798">I told you, it happened in America and somebody in Germany -- no, you will find this in the story of the diary, which I give you.</span> <span id="s799">My nephew, the son of my Dutch brother, is a NATO officer in Germany.</span> <span id="s800">And he comes across a page of my diary in German on a stone on the heath of Lüneburg, where the Pershing weapons on the left, on the west is the English and American, on the right is the Russian.</span> <span id="s801">They stand like this, 1950 -- something.</span> <span id="s802">He's in the army on the beginning of 1960.</span> <span id="s803">And a German historian had f -- se -- written -- seen my diary in the document -- documentary museum in Holland or historical institute, he had translated it and somehow seen to it that it got onto a stone in the heath.</span> <span id="s804">And my nephew Matthias, comes to America, he was a student, exchange student.</span> <span id="s805">And he says, “Hey, did you know that you're published in Germany on a stone?”</span> <span id="s806">I said, “How would I know?”</span> <span id="s807">Paul went there, made a picture, sent me the picture, I immediately throw it out, it was a rotten little picture.</span> <span id="s808">Don't even have it, forgot about it.</span> <span id="s809">Then comes my studies and the professor here who says, “Why don't you do something about the diary?</span> <span id="s810">You have it published, now translate it.”</span> <span id="s811">So this is how it comes.</span> <span id="s812">And then it begins and you get the whole story in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: Well, let's get it on the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A: I don't have to put that in -- in -- in -- in -- again on tape.</span> <span id="s815">How I get the first time to Germany, why I'm so worried about interviews because they ask me political things, I don't want to get into.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: I want to know about how -- how you felt that first time going to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: Heh heh, how I felt.</span> <span id="s818">I had been in Germany in 1970 on my fellowship, my one year, two year fellowship and in 1970, which was 15 years, it's 25 years after the war -- no, 15.</span> <span id="s819">How much is 45 of 70?</span> <span id="s820">25 years after the war, it felt to me as if the war was still on.</span> <span id="s821">I went to Munich.</span> <span id="s822">It was May, 1970.</span> <span id="s823">This is a crucial moment in America.</span> <span id="s824">This -- I was in Munich -- at Kent State, fourth of May, 1970.</span> <span id="s825">I never forget it.</span> <span id="s826">I was an American, they hated.</span> <span id="s827">Because the kids in Germany were protesting against Kent State.</span> <span id="s828">We had Nixon, I was a liberal.</span> <span id="s829">I had voted whoever it was at the time who was against it -- Kennedy, then Nixon, then -- Kennedy, th-that was -- who was -- came after Kennedy, the guy from Texas?</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q: Johnson.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: Johnson.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">Q: Lyndon Johnson.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">A: But this was already Nixon, Nixon was bombing Cambodia and therefore the Kent State started.</span> <span id="s834">The war had involved both Deso and me because Deso was a psychiatrist and kept people out of the war, with certifications.</span> <span id="s835">I was at NYU, you know, we were all anti, anti, anti.</span> <span id="s836">In the beginning we were for it.</span> <span id="s837">For the first, I would say, the first three years or two years, '33, '34, whenever we were in, being Europeans, we were for it.</span> <span id="s838">Because we saw again the salami.</span> <span id="s839">If you give them one piece, you give them everything.</span> <span id="s840">The whole Communist haunt, the whole business.</span> <span id="s841">And then as the war went on, we turned around.</span> <span id="s842">But by 1970, we were already in 1968, after Tonkin, we turned again.</span> <span id="s843">I have family, relatives, nephews who were in the Marines.</span> <span id="s844">The non-Jewish part of my family.</span> <span id="s845">They were Marines in Vietnam, captains, enlisted men, whatever.</span> <span id="s846">And those guys turned while they were there.</span> <span id="s847">My Lai.</span> <span id="s848">I mean I'm just giving you examples.</span> <span id="s849">You see, when we talk about chaos and continuity.</span> <span id="s850">So I'm in Munich, 1970, May, for the first time on my fellowship.</span> <span id="s851">First Paris, then Amsterdam, and then Munich, to find diaries.</span> <span id="s852">And I made one promise to myself, you do not shake hands with anybody who is your own age, you don't talk to anybody who is your own age, because you know that they all lied to you.</span> <span id="s853">So, in other words, at the institute where I did my research, if I got a real old guy and a guy who said, “Gnädige Frau,” kiss your hand, you know, the whole garbage, of the Bavarian civility, which is close to the Austrians.</span> <span id="s854">I was ice cold.</span> <span id="s855">I said, “I need this and this and this from your library, I need this and this and this.”</span> <span id="s856">I wouldn't fraternize with the younger people already then.</span> <span id="s857">When I met people who showed me -- give you one example.</span> <span id="s858">The younger people were already, in 1970, 25 years after the war, when I talked to the people who were 20, 25, 30, they had nothing to do with it.</span> <span id="s859">And I met younger people in Munich.</span> <span id="s860">Among others, a young woman who showed me around in Dachau.</span> <span id="s861">She said, “Do you want to see Dachau, now that you want the diaries?”</span> <span id="s862">I said, “Of course.”</span> <span id="s863">I had been a smoker, I smoked, learned to smoke only during the war.</span> <span id="s864">In Dachau, I hadn't smoked for 16 years.</span> <span id="s865">I hadn't smoked from '54 to 1970.</span> <span id="s866">In Dachau, I said, “I want a cigarette.”</span> <span id="s867">I smoked again from '70, til '92, til the cancer.</span> <span id="s868">They told me at Sloan-Kettering, “Do you smoke?”</span> <span id="s869">“I smoke very little.”</span> <span id="s870">He said, “If you smoke, we don't operate.”</span> <span id="s871">Anyway, so Germany was something I did because it wa-- End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: -- that's with espresso.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">Q: Excellent.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">A: Mixed.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">Q: Okay, so this is Renata Laqueur, tape two.</span> <span id="s876">Did you just say that Germany was business for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: Business what?</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: Germany was business for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s879">A: Yeah, Germany was business, Germans meant bringing back a box full of cards.</span> <span id="s880">Diaries, which I couldn't get at Harvard or Columbia or Washington or wherever I had gone.</span> <span id="s881">Because I knew there was stuff.</span> <span id="s882">And I really found six diaries from Germany and brought them back.</span> <span id="s883">Or five diary, I forget now.</span> <span id="s884">And the incredible surprise was the diaries, which were from 1933 to 1945, by Germans in Dachau, in Oranienburg, near Berlin and this is what the dissertation is about.</span> <span id="s885">Non-Jews, again.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q: Interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">A: And I didn't make any friends in Germany, except I became very friendly with the person who was the lady who showed me around in Dachau, who is today a very important person there, because she became someone who is in charge for all the documentation in the area.</span> <span id="s888">I've never seen her again, but to give you one example, I become easily friends with people if it is business and interesting.</span> <span id="s889">But I will not be intimidated or sentimental just because somebody is nice to me, if I don't trust them.</span> <span id="s890">That carried over into 1985.</span> <span id="s891">1985, the diary had been published in 1983 in Germany.</span> <span id="s892">I had seen the proofs, I had seen the translation and so on and then I had met my diarist, who is hanging up there, there's a picture on the left, the young guy.</span> <span id="s893">And he had translated it and I had met him in Amsterdam and he convinced me to come to Germany in May, 1985.</span> <span id="s894">As you say in French, in English, contre-coeur, against my heart.</span> <span id="s895">And I said, “Peter, I'll come, but I hate it.”</span> <span id="s896">He said, “I'll make it worth your while, you'll meet the people who are like me, who are born in the late 30's or in the early 40's or after the war and you will see that they want to know, they want to help, they want to do.”</span> <span id="s897">I said, “I don't believe it.”</span> <span id="s898">I was very Jewish in this respect.</span> <span id="s899">Jews never believe anybody would do that.</span> <span id="s900">And he said, “I'll prove it.”</span> <span id="s901">He proved it.</span> <span id="s902">He proved it from the moment till he disproved it and I never saw him again.</span> <span id="s903">The following -- I've never told anybody this.</span> <span id="s904">1945, in May, I came to Germany, he introduced me to the papers, he introduced me to the Frankfurter Zeitung.</span> <span id="s905">That's where I met the editor who now published my latest article.</span> <span id="s906">Everything went wrong.</span> <span id="s907">I had always told him, I will meet your family only if you can guarantee me that they were okay.</span> <span id="s908">Because I'm not going to be in anybody's house, where you were either involved.</span> <span id="s909">You told me that your father had worked in Bergen-Belsen as an electrician and that's how you knew.</span> <span id="s910">He couldn't help that he worked there, fine, good.</span> <span id="s911">I'll meet your family.</span> <span id="s912">While I was in May, with him, we spent a day with his family around Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s913">Were received very nicely, his mother, his father, sister, younger people, right?</span> <span id="s914">Very, very nice.</span> <span id="s915">When I came back, in '86 for the movie which they had made about him and me walking in Bergen-Belsen in 1985, I met him again in Hannover and we talked and we again talked about -- he was doing more research about this whole thing and we talked about meeting the wrong or the right people.</span> <span id="s916">He said, “I lied to you.</span> <span id="s917">My father was in the -- ” What is the brown -- the brown shirts?</span> <span id="s918">“The SA.”</span> <span id="s919">I said, “Okay.</span> <span id="s920">I still love you, but I will never meet you again and I will never meet your family again.”</span> <span id="s921">That's how you can trust people.</span> <span id="s922">I've never seen him again.</span> <span id="s923">He has disappeared.</span> <span id="s924">Because I told him, “This doesn't make any sense, why didn't you tell me right away?</span> <span id="s925">I would -- with you I have no problem.</span> <span id="s926">You were born in '44.</span> <span id="s927">You published my diary, you've translated it.</span> <span id="s928">I would sit by candlelight for your children.</span> <span id="s929">With -- with a pen,” not with a thing.</span> <span id="s930">But I said, “I don't want to be lied to, I don't trust you any more.”</span> <span id="s931">Bastard.</span> <span id="s932">That's it.</span> <span id="s933">That's the relationship with Germany.</span> <span id="s934">It remains that way.</span> <span id="s935">If I have friends who tried to whitewash the past, I said, “Look, I don't mind it.</span> <span id="s936">I have a father who was a quote unquote ‘war criminal.</span> <span id="s937">’” In the first World War, that's how they saw him in Belgium, but at least I knew about it.</span> <span id="s938">I can deal with it.</span> <span id="s939">But if I'm told something wrong, I can't deal with it.</span> <span id="s940">Then I don't open up.</span> <span id="s941">That's chaos.</span> <span id="s942">And I am too stupid to lie.</span> <span id="s943">Because if I lie, I have to remember when I lie.</span> <span id="s944">I can't do that.</span> <span id="s945">I may repress it, I may forget it.</span> <span id="s946">Reminds me of Clinton.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Q: Well in -- in your -- the diary excerpt that I have here, you have this epigraph from Goethe, from Faust, interestingly enough.</span> <span id="s948">And I'm not going to do the German because my German is really horrible, so I'll do the English translation.</span> <span id="s949">And you have here --</span></p> <p><span id="s950">A: Do you mean the epinow, wh-wh-what is on top of the diary?</span></p> <p><span id="s951">Q: “What I possess, I see as if from afar; what has vanished-- [indecipherable]”</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A: Yeah, but that was Goethe, that wasn't me who said it.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Q: I said, this is Goethe from Faust.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A: That's a beautiful, beautiful saying.</span> <span id="s955">Because if you're in trouble, any trouble -- marriage, illness, deprivation of freedom, you start living in the past, because you cannot accept reality.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Q: So is this true of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s957">A: No, but it's not only true of me, this was true of -- hey, I have a dissertation.</span> <span id="s958">Dissertation means you find something which is a general happening, this happened to the 13 diarists whom I describe.</span> <span id="s959">They had all the same hang up, the past.</span> <span id="s960">Because you can't survive if you have nothing.</span> <span id="s961">What you can remember is better.</span> <span id="s962">Think about it.</span> <span id="s963">If you have a diarist who entitles his diary, Goethe in Dachau, what does that mean?</span> <span id="s964">I'm only thinking about it now, I haven't thought about it for 30 years.</span> <span id="s965">That he is deep into literature, deep into all the things he remembers about the good, old time when he was a student, free, a teacher.</span> <span id="s966">And so he imagines how it would be if Goethe were in Dachau and if he meets Schiller or if he meets Hildemene or if he meets Shakespeare.</span> <span id="s967">As the Germans say, unser Shakespeare, our Shakespeare.</span> <span id="s968">And that is the intellectual, who is above the real thing.</span> <span id="s969">Just turn it off a minute, I want to show you somethingsymbol 188 \f "Symbol" ready quarter after four.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">Q: Oh, not to worry.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">A: This is your -- your free weekend too, this is your husbands time.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Q: Heh, heh, heh.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">A: By the way, do you get p-paid for this?</span> <span id="s974">I hope so.</span> <span id="s975">Does -- the united -- does the Holocaust Museum --</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q: Tape’s on.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">A: I'm wondering why I didn't ever tell Joan about this, because I've been -- the tape was in 1996.</span> <span id="s978">1994, two years after the cancer, I decided I always wanted to go to Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s979">Not because I'm Jewish, but because of the cultural history.</span> <span id="s980">The churches, the background, the Bible, the whole thing.</span> <span id="s981">I had to see Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s982">So in 1994, I took a tour with an American company and I went with my dissertation advisor, who was German, but 10 years younger, whose father died in a concentration camp, whose brother was killed in Russia and we are best friends, 10 years younger.</span> <span id="s983">And we went together on a trip which got us to Syria first.</span> <span id="s984">So we were in Damascus, we were in the whole Syrian north, so the art and the thing and then crossed over from Amman, we were in Jordan, very strange trip at that time.</span> <span id="s985">Crossed over the Allenby Bridge to get to Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s986">And we came not in by air, but by bus.</span> <span id="s987">So we were in Jericho, it was the hour of our time, we were in Jerusalem and in Tel Aviv when the bombs exploded in the buses.</span> <span id="s988">And for me Jerusalem was the absolute epitome of history come alive.</span> <span id="s989">Like Rome, or Florence, or Amsterdam, or Edinburgh, or you name it.</span> <span id="s990">So this is Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s991">How did we get to that?</span></p> <p><span id="s992">Q: You were asking --</span></p> <p><span id="s993">A: Because I asked you have you been in Israel.</span> <span id="s994">And I'm dying to go back, because I wasn't well, I had a terrible problem and -- and so on.</span> <span id="s995">Thought that the -- the cancer had returned, it didn't.</span> <span id="s996">Anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">Q: Did you feel Jewish there?</span></p> <p><span id="s998">A: No.</span> <span id="s999">Absolutely not, but I felt immensely Christian.</span> <span id="s1000">I mean, everything I knew from the children's Bible was real.</span> <span id="s1001">Gethsemane, and the crosses, and the road at Via Dolorosa, and the landscape from the paintings.</span> <span id="s1002">I mean, if you know your painting history, if you take one liberal arts course with painting and the books, as an undergraduate, you've seen all those painting.</span> <span id="s1003">Besides, I grew up with art.</span> <span id="s1004">No, I never felt Jewish.</span> <span id="s1005">Sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Q: The -- the -- your dissertation, you said you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">A: No, I mean for instance, when people went to the wailing wall and you saw all these people there with the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">Q: Pious.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">A: With the -- with the funny hats on and the -- and hair growing with -- on the -- out of the ears.</span> <span id="s1010">And the guide said, “Does anybody want to go to synagogue?”</span> <span id="s1011">And there were two or three people who wanted to go, who went.</span> <span id="s1012">And Doris -- and Doris said, “Would you want to go anywhere?”</span> <span id="s1013">I said, “No, I just want you to take pictures.”</span> <span id="s1014">Well, that's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">Q: Your dissertation, you said these were diaries of Germans?</span> <span id="s1016">Non-Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">A: Do you know, the dissertation were whatever I found.</span> <span id="s1018">I read diaries of three or four Dutch, I have to look it up again.</span> <span id="s1019">You have to just -- 13 in all.</span> <span id="s1020">Five Germans, not a single Jew in German.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">A: There were professionals, or doctors or painters or journalists and one woman who may have been half Jewish, I think.</span> <span id="s1023">And the Dutch were two Jews in Bergen-Belsen, one guy who was Jewish and who died in Auschwitz and I have his unpublished diary, so that's three and two resistance fighters.</span> <span id="s1024">The Goethe in Dachau is -- is a Dutchman, non-Jewish.</span> <span id="s1025">That's it.</span> <span id="s1026">And the diaries were in Dutch, in French and in German.</span> <span id="s1027">And I pulled them together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: In your, I think it's in the first interview, you talk about that you've always felt you were a translator.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: That what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">Q: You were a translator.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">A: I was a tran -- oh, that's what I did in Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">Q: Yeah, but I don't mean literally.</span> <span id="s1033">That you have always been in some way translating, not just from language to language, but in fact from experience to experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">A: That I don't know whether I meant it metaphorically, I don't remember.</span> <span id="s1035">I don't know how to say what a translator is, somebody who brings something across -- I don't know.</span> <span id="s1036">I don't know what that means.</span> <span id="s1037">To me, translation is taking something from one language into another language and with it comes also the knowledge of how people behave in that country.</span> <span id="s1038">Because if you look at the German language, the German language is very much like the Germans, very complicated, very precise and always putting something together which nobody else puts together.</span> <span id="s1039">The English language is to me the language.</span> <span id="s1040">It has more synonyms, for -- just look at a dictionary and a German dictionary, because it's combined of romance languages, Latin, Greek, Celtic, Germanic and everything.</span> <span id="s1041">It is the richest language in the world.</span> <span id="s1042">Because they have everything.</span> <span id="s1043">This goes for American English, same way, because it comes from English.</span> <span id="s1044">And then they threw in all the other languages here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Q: But do you see yourself as a translator from one -- one set of time to another time period, from one culture to another, from one kind of emotion to another?</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">A: I don't know, I'm very unemotional when I work.</span> <span id="s1047">I'm not sentimental.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">Q: So -- so you -- you don't -- you don't see the metaphoric application of the word --</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">A: I don't see it an anthropological, sociological way, but it's -- you have a good point, it's something which occasionally I may be even doing it without thinking.</span> <span id="s1050">You're absolutely right, because if I think of some of the troubles I had with the dissertation, because of the gruesomeness of the German language, which then describes certain situations in a concentration camp, I mean the word, it's zertrümmern I mean, I'm thinking of all the things where I tried to find -- you smash something.</span> <span id="s1051">The zertrümmern is you really split, you can hear almost the stones coming apart.</span> <span id="s1052">The German language is gruesome.</span> <span id="s1053">It's like the fairy tales.</span> <span id="s1054">Because they combine two things which are not combinable and it becomes a concept.</span> <span id="s1055">Never occurred to me.</span> <span id="s1056">And when you work with the concentration camp literature, you get into situations.</span> <span id="s1057">I'm thinking about how d -- I have a chapter in the dissertation about the German language, the SS language, where they talk about the Dritte Reich, the Third Reich expressions.</span> <span id="s1058">And if somebody yells at you in the concentration camp -- I'll say it in German first and then in English.</span> <span id="s1059">“Ich laß euch stehen bis euch die Scheiße aus dem – aus dem Nase – aus dem Mund koff.”</span> <span id="s1060">I let you stand here til the shit runs out of your mouth.</span> <span id="s1061">So in other words, abnormal, chaotic, whatever.</span> <span id="s1062">This was the language of the Third Reich.</span> <span id="s1063">And the Germans who -- which also is in Goldhagen, the famous Goldhagen book, which I despise.</span> <span id="s1064">I had a big argument in Germany about that book.</span> <span id="s1065">The Goldhagen book is incredible.</span> <span id="s1066">It's a lousy, biased version of the whole thing, because he “forgets” about the Gypsies, he forgets about the non-Jews who were killed.</span> <span id="s1067">And that, to my mind, six million is -- is not enough, there is more.</span> <span id="s1068">And that is what's coming out.</span> <span id="s1069">And that has something to do -- now going back from the language again, into the whole history, it will take hundred years till we have the whole story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">Q: How --</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">A: But when you mention translation, it gets me into things I never think about.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">Q: What language are you most comfortable in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">A: English.</span> <span id="s1074">I can't write in Dutch, I can't even write a letter any more.</span> <span id="s1075">Because I've been away now, wait a minute '52, say '92 is 40 years, so let's say 45 years.</span> <span id="s1076">I am 78, so my first 35 years are in Europe, and in Europe I already spoke more than Dutch.</span> <span id="s1077">I spoke fluent French, fluent English.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">Q: And German?</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">A: Couldn't help it, like a Swiss girl.</span> <span id="s1080">You learn it in school and I'm gifted.</span> <span id="s1081">So I mean, I've learn -- I've learned Spanish here, just for the hell of it.</span> <span id="s1082">I'm not bragging, it's just one of the things you get like you get vitamins, you get languages.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">Q: Oh, my family's the same way, I mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">Q: I'm the idiot, you know.</span> <span id="s1086">My mother speaks I don't know how many languages, her brother even more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">A: That's right, but you get this because you go to a decent public school.</span> <span id="s1088">It's not a private school.</span> <span id="s1089">I never went to private school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">Q: In your -- the diary, the translation that I have here, you use a lot of musical imagery.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">A: What, you -- do you have the diary?</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">Q: I have here, yeah, I have diary of Bergen-Belsen, N-March 1944, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">A: No, no, no, no, wait a minute --</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">Q: Okay --</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">A: What do you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">Q: Dear, you really have a copy.</span> <span id="s1097">Music, yeah, the music is something I grew up with, like the fashion, but the music has gone away, it has become theater now.</span> <span id="s1098">Since -- and that may be why I love America, I got all my background, beautiful and I'm grateful for that to God and my parents.</span> <span id="s1099">The background I have is one solid, liberal arts -- I could have had science, but I refused to get interested.</span> <span id="s1100">That's a different story.</span> <span id="s1101">In America, in New York, I became a theater addict.</span> <span id="s1102">In the 50's, no more, because it's crap right now, in comparison to what we had in the 50's.</span> <span id="s1103">I saw every great American play, from Miller to Tennessee William, not one time, but five, six times.</span> <span id="s1104">Cheap.</span> <span id="s1105">In the balcony.</span> <span id="s1106">I went through the whole Broadway, up, but also down.</span> <span id="s1107">Now we are back, we are coming back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">Q: Why theater and not music?</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">A: Because I had all the music and I don't, I got all the music as a youngster.</span> <span id="s1110">I couldn't do both because it was a matter of timing, a matter of money and why not music, because I don't have the patience to sit and just listen.</span> <span id="s1111">I got spoiled.</span> <span id="s1112">Now, since 1945, I don't think I've been to a single concert, I had all my concerts in the concertgebouw in Amsterdam with Mengelberg, with Furtwrangler, with Toscanini, whoever came over, we -- we heard and saw.</span> <span id="s1113">But since I came to New York, it was theater and literature.</span> <span id="s1114">And New York is both and it's also music.</span> <span id="s1115">But some other people, some my friends say, “How come you never went to Carnegie Hall?”</span> <span id="s1116">I only went to Carnegie Hall for certain things, at Christmas or so, or if Schneider was giving a kid concert, things like that.</span> <span id="s1117">With my nephews and nieces, of course they have to get it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">Q: You talk a lot about smells in the diary.</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">A: Smells.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">Q: Do you still connect strongly with smell?</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">A: Very much no, lost all of it with the chemotherapy.</span> <span id="s1122">Don't smell anything.</span> <span id="s1123">That's why I eat garlic, because I never smell it anyway.</span> <span id="s1124">Smell, sound -- I suddenly remember the smell of, what is that turnip?</span> <span id="s1125">The smell of stinking something, of the disinfecting in the shower.</span> <span id="s1126">That smell was unforgettable.</span> <span id="s1127">It is like in Proust, when he has the madeleine and he gets the whole thing back.</span> <span id="s1128">That's the things which you don't repress, which come back as they come.</span> <span id="s1129">If a certain smell comes, you associate with the smell.</span> <span id="s1130">If a certain sound, if a certain picture.</span> <span id="s1131">Associative memo-memory.</span> <span id="s1132">Don't you have that?</span> <span id="s1133">Every person has that.</span> <span id="s1134">What do you remember of your youth?</span> <span id="s1135">A sound, a smell, a feeling, a touch.</span> <span id="s1136">All the six senses.</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">Q: So you remember --</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">A: Strange.</span> <span id="s1139">As we talk about it, I suddenly realize, I can not remember pain.</span> <span id="s1140">That's repressed.</span> <span id="s1141">I'm thinking of pain -- strangely enough, that was in normal times, the pain of dentistry.</span> <span id="s1142">That is the pain I remember and that is the pain I refuse.</span> <span id="s1143">I do not go to any dentist who will not give me anything against nerve pain.</span> <span id="s1144">Be it a bridge, be it a nerve -- root canal, be it a drilling.</span> <span id="s1145">I said, “I won't come unless you deafen me, dumb me.”</span> <span id="s1146">He said, “Good.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">Q: Okay, I don't know if this is a pain, but you in the diary say, “The nightmares of the typhus siege have not left me.”</span> <span id="s1148">How about now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">A: The pain of -- I'm thinking of pain in the concentration camp, but I had very little pain.</span> <span id="s1150">Very little pain except -- discomfort is not pain.</span> <span id="s1151">Pain and discomfort is incredibly different.</span> <span id="s1152">Real pain is un -- I've never been tortured.</span> <span id="s1153">Unbearable pain, I only remember in connection with the colon cancer.</span> <span id="s1154">And that was unbearable because it was unexpected.</span> <span id="s1155">And once again I – d-don’t -- I'm not -- I don't know why that has anything to do with anything.</span> <span id="s1156">I wake up on the night that O.J. is driving his white whatever --</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">Q: Bronco.</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">A: Bronco -- with such horrible pain as I've never had in my life.</span> <span id="s1159">Friday the June 12th, going onto Saturday morning.</span> <span id="s1160">I go to the bathroom, I vomit.</span> <span id="s1161">I vomit and shit at the same time and I know what it is.</span> <span id="s1162">How do I know?</span> <span id="s1163">From literature, from Hemingway, from Snow of Kilimanjaro.</span> <span id="s1164">At four a.m. I call my doctor at home, the chief of gastroenterology at Sloan-Kettering.</span> <span id="s1165">And I said, “Sidney, I have gangrene.</span> <span id="s1166">I have an obstruction.”</span> <span id="s1167">He said, “Are you nuts?”</span> <span id="s1168">I said, “No.</span> <span id="s1169">I stink, nothing stays up or down and I -- I have such pain, I'm in absolute -- wild with pain.”</span> <span id="s1170">He said, “Go to the hospital.”</span> <span id="s1171">I said, “I can't move, I have such pain.”</span> <span id="s1172">He said, “I can't help you, my wife is dying.”</span> <span id="s1173">His wife died that night --</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Q: Oh my God.</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">A: At Sloan-Kettering.</span> <span id="s1176">But that has nothing to do with anything.</span> <span id="s1177">How I got from the bedroom to the phone, calling my super.</span> <span id="s1178">I said, “Ruben, I am dying of pain, I have to get to Sloan-Kettering, will you take me?”</span> <span id="s1179">He said, “I'm coming.”</span> <span id="s1180">Looking for my papers here, to get my papers, my keys, I ran into the desk, the desk broke apart, because everything is old here and rickety and Ruben comes up.</span> <span id="s1181">I said, “Ruben, help me get dressed, get me to the car and get me to Sloan-Kettering.”</span> <span id="s1182">It took us an hour to get me dressed, to get me there and then they took over and it took them 24 hours till they decided they operate.</span> <span id="s1183">My surgeon came back from the country.</span> <span id="s1184">He said, “Renata is ill, I come back.”</span> <span id="s1185">They operated, it was gangrene.</span> <span id="s1186">They took again, some stuff out, nothing to do with the cancer.</span> <span id="s1187">It had something to do with something I had in my belly for years and it had festered, infected itself, strangulated itself and that's it.</span> <span id="s1188">But it was the worst pain I've ever had in my life and after that I was six weeks with drainage, had home care here, in this apartment.</span> <span id="s1189">It was the most debilitating operation I ever had.</span> <span id="s1190">And then I went to the Near East and to Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s1191">And to Petra and in Petra climbed on a horse and thought I had split something.</span> <span id="s1192">And that's why it wasn't so happy in Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s1193">Then comes the third operation.</span> <span id="s1194">I am in the Far East, traveling, and I get a terrible cold in Bangkok, and I start coughing and I feel that I have another time, something going wrong in the right side.</span> <span id="s1195">I come back to Sloan-Kettering in January and see my surgeon.</span> <span id="s1196">“It's nothing.</span> <span id="s1197">It's a muscle which got in the way, you got to do exercise.</span> <span id="s1198">I will operate on you, but this time I can't do anything any more, unless you're really very thin.</span> <span id="s1199">Lose some weight, I will try to stitch you up from the inside.</span> <span id="s1200">Otherwise I have to put a maze in behind it, which is a foreign body and then you may reject it, you get more operations, more operations.</span> <span id="s1201">Do what I tell you, come back in three weeks, we'll operate.</span> <span id="s1202">Lose three, four pounds.”</span> <span id="s1203">We operate, I still have the stuff.</span> <span id="s1204">He could do what he could do.</span> <span id="s1205">He said, “Stay thin, you have no cancer.</span> <span id="s1206">Come back every year for your colonoscopy.”</span> <span id="s1207">But pain, if it's unbearable, I remember it.</span> <span id="s1208">But it had nothing to do with the concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">Q: Disease has shaped much of your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">Q: Disease has shaped a lot of your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">A: It's what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">Q: Has shaped a lot of your life, it seems.</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">A: It's shaped a lot of my life.</span> <span id="s1215">It's still shaping.</span> <span id="s1216">And I don't know, sometimes, I mean, I sound very upbeat when I meet Joan or you, because I only talk about the positive thing.</span> <span id="s1217">The negative things are getting older, feeling that you can't really do anything any more which is worth it.</span> <span id="s1218">You want to leave something for the young people and the only time I really feel very “with it” is when I talk to youngsters, be it at the U.N. or at the private schools, or in Germany and I tell them, “Let's avoid this.</span> <span id="s1219">Let's not discriminate,” andsymbol 188 \f "Symbol" I think it is the whole discrimin-ory-tory process of because he or she has a different skin or a different nose or a different background and this goes right into the 90's.</span> <span id="s1220">And I have been in America since the McCarthy time, through a couple of presidents, always voted against, never for.</span> <span id="s1221">What means for freedom, for liberalism, for whatever will give people what I consider a better life.</span> <span id="s1222">And that's it.</span> <span id="s1223">And if you live in New York, and if you keep your eyes open, you see almost as if everything in a microcosm, is because everything which happens here, happens all over the world.</span> <span id="s1224">All I have to do is go west or south in Manhattan, or even east, and walk along the river and I'm back in Holland, because it's the same landscape.</span> <span id="s1225">Especially if I go down to the battery.</span> <span id="s1226">Brooklyn is Holland in many ways.</span> <span id="s1227">New Jersey is in many way Holland.</span> <span id="s1228">And Ellis Island.</span> <span id="s1229">All that stuff is Holland.</span> <span id="s1230">Even with the church spires.</span> <span id="s1231">If you go mid-town, if you go downtown, you have America.</span> <span id="s1232">If you go uptown, out of New York, you're somewhere in Europe.</span> <span id="s1233">Because it's -- can be either Germany or Holland or England.</span> <span id="s1234">You go to Boston, you're almost in Portugal.</span> <span id="s1235">No, and this is living in America.</span> <span id="s1236">Everything repeats itself here.</span> <span id="s1237">I love it.</span> <span id="s1238">I love being a European who has become an American.</span> <span id="s1239">Because my Europeanism has reinforced what I love in America.</span> <span id="s1240">Whether I'm in Portugal and see the same stones, which I see when I am north of Boston, because that connects, or whether I'm in Ireland on the west coast and I know that someday this was all together.</span> <span id="s1241">And I understand the Irish and I understand the Scotch and I understand the Dutch and I understand the Portuguese because I learned Spanish.</span> <span id="s1242">And I have not been in South America, I've carefully avoided it because I like to go to countries where I feel comfortable.</span> <span id="s1243">I have avoided Chile because of the dictatorship, Brazil because of it's stuff.</span> <span id="s1244">Argentina because of Franco.</span> <span id="s1245">I wasn't in Spain more or less, till Franco was kaput.</span> <span id="s1246">In Greece till the dictatorship was kaput.</span> <span id="s1247">And that's very hard these days, to avoid countries.</span> <span id="s1248">I'm still dying to go to Iran Persepolis.</span> <span id="s1249">But I'll wait.</span> <span id="s1250">If I see it fine, if I don't see it, fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">Q: How's your health now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">Q: How is your health now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">A: It's okay.</span> <span id="s1255">It's okay if I don't overdo it.</span> <span id="s1256">I swim six times a week.</span> <span id="s1257">I walk five times a day up and down.</span> <span id="s1258">I walk every day at least half an hour.</span> <span id="s1259">Shop every day, carry every day and my family wants me in a nursing home.</span> <span id="s1260">I said n -- my doctors at Sloan-Kettering said, “Are you crazy?</span> <span id="s1261">Stay as long as you can and feet first.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">Q: Do you still work?</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">A: I still work at Sloan-Kettering at least once a week.</span> <span id="s1264">I am part of a program where they talk about nutrition and cancer and I help them with their grants.</span> <span id="s1265">I work with psychiatrist, who gives me manuscripts about post-traumatic stress and so on.</span> <span id="s1266">I do stuff.</span> <span id="s1267">Not enough.</span> <span id="s1268">Don't get paid.</span> <span id="s1269">They have no money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">Q: Hospital seems to be recurring in your life, you -- you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">Q: Hospitals seem to recur in your life, a-at one point I think, in the first interview, you talk about that it had nothing to do with patients or medicine, it was about food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">A: That's right, it had to do -- it wasn't true, because the first 10 years -- I worked 23 years.</span> <span id="s1274">The first 10 years I trained, in a sense of I had never, ever done any budgets, I'd never done any financial thing.</span> <span id="s1275">I went to school in the hospital, on my own time, didn't get paid for that.</span> <span id="s1276">And I learned how to write grants and then only the last 10 years had to do with food because I was in nutrition and cancer.</span> <span id="s1277">The rest of the time I just learned about cancer.</span> <span id="s1278">And boy did I learn.</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">Q: Why did you or how did you transition from comparative literature --</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">A: Oh, that's just very easy, the New York Times.</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning of Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">A: -- put you into cancer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">Q: Is it your PhD?</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">A: PhD, 1971, I look for jobs, I write hundreds of letters, get hundreds of nothing back.</span> <span id="s1285">In February, it must have been February the fourth, on the Sunday Times, there is an ad of Memorial Sl -- I had worked there as a secretary.</span> <span id="s1286">When I came off the boat here and off the train in Canada, I didn't want to work in business.</span> <span id="s1287">I worked at Sloan-Kettering, because it was on my avenue, I lived here and I was a medical secretary.</span> <span id="s1288">I could learn that, I had heard medicine at home, I had all the background.</span> <span id="s1289">I was six years a medical secretary at Sloan-Kettering, I need this in order to tell you how I got back.</span> <span id="s1290">I left there only because my mother had died and I got some money and I decided I don't want a mink coat, I don't want a house in the country, I want to study.</span> <span id="s1291">So I studied New York University, Columbia, 1960.</span> <span id="s1292">I had worked at Sloan-Kettering from 1953 to '59.</span> <span id="s1293">In between I worked as a part time secretary in medicine because I didn't want to give that up, so I had medical experience.</span> <span id="s1294">From '71 to '73, I looked for jobs in comparative literature, couldn't get a thing.</span> <span id="s1295">February fourth, 1973, there is an ad in the New York Time: Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, looking for a coordinator-writer for their grants office, who has medical background, languages.</span> <span id="s1296">I write a letter to my former boss, who lives on East 68th Street, bring it to his home and say, “Marty, I need that job.</span> <span id="s1297">I'm going to Antigua this week, because I need a tan for my application, see I have to look better.</span> <span id="s1298">Get me that job.”</span> <span id="s1299">I wrote a letter also to Sloan-Kettering and sent him a copy.</span> <span id="s1300">I come back from Antigua, I have the job.</span> <span id="s1301">He left a message -- I didn't have an answering phone, he left a message for me, call me, you have an interview.</span> <span id="s1302">Or they called me, whatever was the note, I had an interview.</span> <span id="s1303">I got the job.</span> <span id="s1304">At that time, 10,000 dollars a year, which was 200 a week, I worked from eight in the morning til 10 at night, no overtime, no nothing and learned the job, grant writing.</span> <span id="s1305">And I ended up with having something like 150 labs as my clients.</span> <span id="s1306">And reading their stuff, editing their stuff, putting it together in the format and shipping it out to the National Cancer Institute or to the National Institute of Heart and Lung and I learned more than I ever learned.</span> <span id="s1307">So this is how I got from literature into medicine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">Q: Medicine frames your life in so many ways, I mean your father --</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">A: Yeah, that's right.</span> <span id="s1310">I'm married, I'm -- father was a ph -- a physician, a husband who was a physician, a brother who was a physician, and so on.</span> <span id="s1311">And medicine is -- I always wanted to write about the doctor in literature.</span> <span id="s1312">Doctor and literature are very close.</span> <span id="s1313">Doctor and science and mathematics are very close.</span> <span id="s1314">It's the literature and the doctor which is very close to each other.</span> <span id="s1315">That's the answer.</span> <span id="s1316">And I end up with a dissertation was just literature.</span> <span id="s1317">And two years later I'm in medicine.</span> <span id="s1318">Never occurred to me till I talked to you.</span> <span id="s1319">So again I travel from one specialty to the other, from one country to another, from one discipline to another.</span> <span id="s1320">The fashion is the -- the drawing.</span> <span id="s1321">The drawing comes back as I travel, because I only draw every time -- a Christmas card is a building, is architecture.</span> <span id="s1322">That goes back to my youth, to my education, to the liberal arts.</span> <span id="s1323">So the whole thing is full cycle.</span> <span id="s1324">If the dissertation is finally published.</span> <span id="s1325">I'm waiting.</span> <span id="s1326">Look at that article in the Frankfurter Zeitung.</span> <span id="s1327">What else is that but going back in time from experience to transition, from chaos to order and continuity?</span> <span id="s1328">And I'm, by Jove, not an intellectual, I'm an intuitive talker, doer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">Q: Today, while we're talking, are you participant or spectator?</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">A: I'm very much a participant, I'm not a spectator.</span> <span id="s1331">I'd -- strange thing is -- that's very interesting.</span> <span id="s1332">If you talk, you don't document.</span> <span id="s1333">If I write, I better watch what I'm doing and there I become the spectator.</span> <span id="s1334">Because I cannot write unless I edit.</span> <span id="s1335">If I talk, unless you guys stop the machine, there are lots of things I might want edited out if it goes somewhere.</span> <span id="s1336">But if I talk, I talk honest.</span> <span id="s1337">It's an incredible question, are you a participant or a spectator.</span> <span id="s1338">I don't think I sense it a lot, I sense it a little bit, but very much on the surface.</span> <span id="s1339">I just ser-se -- sense it only four letter words, because I very often think in four letter words.</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">Q: You think in English?</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">A: I think -- I think in English, I dream in English, I react physiologically in English.</span> <span id="s1342">I know this because I went into shock.</span> <span id="s1343">I went -- they gave me the wrong medicine in 1956 when I was an employee at Sloan-Kettering, as a secretary.</span> <span id="s1344">They gave me penicillin and I went into shock.</span> <span id="s1345">And they called my husband who was work out in Creedmore as a psychiatrist, they said, “Renata is in shock, come.</span> <span id="s1346">We gave her penicillin and she's --” And he said, “What's she talking?”</span> <span id="s1347">He says, “English.”</span> <span id="s1348">So in other words, English has become my communication.</span> <span id="s1349">At the same time, I also know -- and this has nothing to do with me, but I know from Holland and from the resistance that if they gave people -- they didn't have to torture them, they just wanted to find out where they were from, all they had to do was take a pin, and how they said “ow”, or “ai” or “ouch” or “oy”, they know where they came from.</span> <span id="s1350">And I know from having been married to a psychiatrist and having dealt with all kinds of issues also at Sloan-Kettering, that if you are in pain and how you react, it will bring back your mother tongue.</span> <span id="s1351">And what I say, when they do something, I'm -- I'm usually don't say anything, I’m not a howler, I'm very tough -- is -- it may go back to German or to Dutch, but I doubt it.</span> <span id="s1352">Because even in shock I talked English.</span> <span id="s1353">But I know, for instance, that the aunt of my husband -- he was Jewish, Deso -- and she came from Poland and her children were very un-Jewish because they had married American Fortune 500 people.</span> <span id="s1354">And got made it up in the media and wherever, and she refused to say that she was Jewish, although her name was Margulies.</span> <span id="s1355">They said it was French and they said he had been to the Sorbonne when he had never been near it.</span> <span id="s1356">Doesn't make any difference, but they were not Jewish.</span> <span id="s1357">What does bad luck have?</span> <span id="s1358">She gets a stroke and she talks only Polish and Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1359">So this is where I'm very careful and I tell myself, don't ever deny anything, because if you're on your deathbed or if you have a stroke, you'll talk anyway, whatever it is.</span> <span id="s1360">So I don't deny anything, I would never deny anything, it's stupid.</span> <span id="s1361">If you lie you have to remember what you said.</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">Q: But you said in that first interview that you're -- can't --</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">A: I'm not Jewish enough for the Holocaust Museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">Q: No, no, wait a second, you said that your -- I think it was your second husband said that you were, what, a monster, you weren't a moral person.</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">A: That's right, no, my m -- m -- my Deso, not Paul, Paul is my generation.</span> <span id="s1366">My husband was the 19th century moralist, the very moral person.</span> <span id="s1367">He said, “You are an amoral person.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">Q: Are you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">Q: What does that mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">A: What does that mean?</span> <span id="s1372">It means that I have my own rules.</span> <span id="s1373">I don't feel, I felt -- I've -- I had to go into psychiatrist to be re-educated because I was lifting -- shoplifting left and right.</span> <span id="s1374">Because the barrack was so nice and I would take this or I would take that.</span> <span id="s1375">I still -- it's very hard to go somewhere that I don't pick up a lipstick.</span> <span id="s1376">But, I have my own rules.</span> <span id="s1377">As long as I don't hurt anybody.</span> <span id="s1378">For instance, all these sexual things, I don't want to talk about this, shut this offsymbol 188 \f "Symbol" -- you to the U.S. Holocaust Museum, my inner soul.</span> <span id="s1379">Give me -- give me an answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">Q: Because your soul and your experiences differ from anyone else's soul or experiences and that's how we learn.</span> <span id="s1381">That's where truth comes from.</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">A: You're not a psychiatrist.</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">A: And I'm not --</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">Q: I've been to a number, though.</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">Q: I've been to a few.</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">A: No, but what I mean and I have carefully avoided psychiatry, not because I've anything to hide, but because I don't believe in it.</span> <span id="s1389">You have to do it yourself.</span> <span id="s1390">And my husband agreed.</span> <span id="s1391">He was a psychiatrist, but he was a psychiatrist of the eclectic ilk.</span> <span id="s1392">He said, “If I have a patient who is with me longer than six months or a year, I kick him out.</span> <span id="s1393">Because if I haven't covered everything this person has to give me, there's something wrong with my approach or his denial.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">Q: Okay, you say you still shoplift.</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">Q: You said you still shoplift lipsticks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">A: So what?</span> <span id="s1398">So I've made peace with it.</span> <span id="s1399">But -- I'm very happy with it.</span> <span id="s1400">If I can live with myself and if I can function and overcome barricades which obstruct my life, be they in career or in health or in whatever and I still don't hurt people, why do I need psychiatry?</span> <span id="s1401">Why do I have to bare my soul?</span> <span id="s1402">It's nobody's business what is the third level, the fourth level?</span> <span id="s1403">I really feel -- I'm a Scorpio and Scorpio are diggers.</span> <span id="s1404">We dig deep down and then we hide.</span> <span id="s1405">Do you know how I learned that?</span> <span id="s1406">From my psychiatrist husband, who believed in somewhere, not in astrology, but he says, “You know, just look at your picture, we are both Scorpios, we fight like hell because we are both the same sign.</span> <span id="s1407">I'm a generation older than you and I have more moral beliefs than you do, you are totally demoralized by war.</span> <span id="s1408">Your relationship with your father, you were fa -- fighting the nine -- the 19th century all your life.</span> <span id="s1409">You're all 20th century.”</span> <span id="s1410">Now I'm 21st century.</span> <span id="s1411">He said, “The last thing you need is psychiatry.</span> <span id="s1412">You need an education, a re-education.</span> <span id="s1413">You have to learn that you can't do this, you can't do that, you can't do that without running into trouble.</span> <span id="s1414">But otherwise --”</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">Q: In the -- the article you sent me, the translation of -- for the Frankfurt paper, you say that you're -- you won't take a shower, you're --</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">A: I don't want -- I hate showers.</span> <span id="s1417">People who were in Auschwitz would understand this much better because shower was gas.</span> <span id="s1418">In Bergen-Belsen there was no gas, but a shower in Bergen-Belsen meant taking a shower while the SS is watching and with all these other skeletons and whatever.</span> <span id="s1419">I don't like showers, I've never liked showers.</span> <span id="s1420">I want a bathtub, where I'm alone and nobody watching me.</span> <span id="s1421">But showers for other people who were in concentration camp is gas.</span> <span id="s1422">And that -- that's why I don't make a big thing about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">Q: Y-You referred in the other interview to victims in Bloomingdale's clothes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">A: Yeah, that was that horrible movie, made about, I think it was m-meant -- it was based on a Gerald Green movie, where they showed the people in Theresienstadt and where they -- I said they were in Bloomingdale's clothes, they looked much too good.</span> <span id="s1425">And that is one of the reasons, I'm not bitter about it, but I ended up with the literary agent of Norman Mailer, Gerald Green and a couple of other famous writers, where I gave him my diary and the dissertation and I think I paid him 800 dollars to just read the crap.</span> <span id="s1426">And he came back with a criticism which I have somewhere.</span> <span id="s1427">I've hidden it, but it is like going into psychoanalysis.</span> <span id="s1428">What he said hurt so deeply that I got burned.</span> <span id="s1429">He said, “It's very original, it's very real, but it is totally unpublishable because there is no sex, there is no real violence, there is no -- it's not sellable, salable.”</span> <span id="s1430">If I would be dead it would sell like hotcakes!</span> <span id="s1431">I know that.</span> <span id="s1432">If Anne Frank wouldn't have died, the diary would never have been published.</span> <span id="s1433">You have to die in order to prove something.</span> <span id="s1434">I'm not bitter, because I'm delighted to be here.</span> <span id="s1435">But how often have I said in Germany, if I would have been died, I wouldn't need you to publish it.</span> <span id="s1436">But the Germans had a bad conscience, so they published it.</span> <span id="s1437">Isn't that kind of funny?</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">Q: Who would you like your audience to be for your work?</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">Q: Who would you like your audience to be?</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">A: The youngest possible, because they have no idea what we're talking about because all they get is the stuff from other countries where you have things like that happen, Bosnia, maybe even Iraq.</span> <span id="s1442">What do we know what this God damn guy is doing?</span> <span id="s1443">We know now about Taliban and the people in Afghanistan.</span> <span id="s1444">And especially how women are being mistreated and so on and so on.</span> <span id="s1445">It's going on.</span> <span id="s1446">And I still talk like an old professor.</span> <span id="s1447">Remember one of the guys whom I quote in my dissertation, who calls the 20th century the century of the grotesque?</span> <span id="s1448">We are going with the grotesque into the 21st century.</span> <span id="s1449">Everything is upside down, topsy turvy.</span> <span id="s1450">From the smart bombs to the coletvil damage, to the concentration camps, to the treatment of people, to the racism.</span> <span id="s1451">I mean everything.</span> <span id="s1452">There is nothing which is normal.</span> <span id="s1453">The good old times.</span> <span id="s1454">There is no continuity.</span> <span id="s1455">And if we lose respect, we lose continuity.</span> <span id="s1456">Boy am I preaching on the soapbox right now.</span> <span id="s1457">I would stand in Central Park and this is how I stood in Germany and this is how I stood at the UN.</span> <span id="s1458">I said, “Kids, do something about it, let's have some decency, continuity and I mean morality, which is acceptable.”</span> <span id="s1459">You can still steal a lipstick or have an affair and still be very moral.</span> <span id="s1460">You know what I mean.</span> <span id="s1461">Okay?</span> <span id="s1462">Basta.</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1464">When you went back --</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">A: It is 10 after five.</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">A: You started at 20 of three.</span> <span id="s1468">How long do you want to have this go on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">Q: Are you tired?</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">A: That was the trouble with Joan.</span> <span id="s1471">Joan says, “I have more questions.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">Q: Hey, I'm Jewish, of course I have more questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">A: That has nothing -- oh, wo-wo-wo-wo-wo-wait a minute.</span> <span id="s1474">Jews -- if you talk to Jews, real Jews, they ask you a question, but when you answer, their answer is a question.</span> <span id="s1475">And that's why it never stops.</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">Q: So why shouldn't it be?</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">Q: So why shouldn't it?</span> <span id="s1479">To answer you with a question.</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">A: No, no, I am very serious.</span> <span id="s1481">There comes a point where, to my mind, unless you have a real question, this all has been answered already, was by Joan.</span> <span id="s1482">No, she didn't ask me, do you feel a participant or do you feel a spectator.</span> <span id="s1483">This is as crucial as why did you write.</span> <span id="s1484">Because I come to c-certain level of insight, which actually makes me now even more keen on never giving more interviews.</span> <span id="s1485">There is no point to it.</span> <span id="s1486">I don't have to discover things, I know by now.</span> <span id="s1487">How important is it whether I'm a spectator or not?</span> <span id="s1488">It's a nice twist.</span> <span id="s1489">It's a psychological twisting the knife.</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">Q: I don't understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">A: I don't know what this is, but you guys, reporters, interviewers, historians, professors, psychologists, all of you God damn compassional, including myself, I have a feeling when you interview people, you sometimes open a wound.</span> <span id="s1492">And you're not cruel, but you twist the knife.</span> <span id="s1493">You go a little deeper.</span> <span id="s1494">And if you get an exhibitionist like me, who loves to talk, you're lucky, because you dig deeper and deeper and you find levels.</span> <span id="s1495">But there are always levels nobody will ever talk about.</span> <span id="s1496">So what?</span> <span id="s1497">So you go from level one with the elevator down in the basement and then you go below the earth's surface and then you go all the way up and you come on the other side of the earth and you come up again.</span> <span id="s1498">And what have you done?</span> <span id="s1499">Dug into something.</span> <span id="s1500">And what are we going to do about it?</span> <span id="s1501">That is the thing.</span> <span id="s1502">I'm not hurting more than anybody else, I think I hurt less, because I have in -- desensitized myself.</span> <span id="s1503">I refuse to feel pain.</span> <span id="s1504">That's part of survival.</span> <span id="s1505">Some people said to me, “You never mourned for your husband, whom you dearly loved.”</span> <span id="s1506">He was the great love of my life.</span> <span id="s1507">I said, “Who has time?”</span> <span id="s1508">If I do that -- I've barely given myself time to recuperate, in order to get on top again.</span> <span id="s1509">So that is the style, but that's not something which other people do, or should do.</span> <span id="s1510">This is very, very unusual and may eventually, finally kill me.</span> <span id="s1511">This week -- okay, let it be, I'll leave it on, although I haven't told anybody, ever.</span> <span id="s1512">This week I went to the tailor and I had to have a pair of sh -- pants shortened.</span> <span id="s1513">I step out of my pants, I step back into them and it's in a little stall where you have a curtain around you because it's in the shop and I have nothing to hold on and I knew I was going to fall.</span> <span id="s1514">And I only told myself, “Not on your head.”</span> <span id="s1515">So I fell backwards and I'm used to being very limber.</span> <span id="s1516">And the guy was not there.</span> <span id="s1517">I said, “I'm falling.”</span> <span id="s1518">He said, “Oh, my God.”</span> <span id="s1519">I told myself, “Geez, what does God have to do with?”</span> <span id="s1520">I fell.</span> <span id="s1521">I hurt myself quite badly on my right side and I told myself, “Don't break your hip.”</span> <span id="s1522">I have osteoporosis, of course.</span> <span id="s1523">Don't break this, but I suddenly realized, once again I had gone beyond what I should be doing.</span> <span id="s1524">I should have known that with this side effects I have, I should hold onto something.</span> <span id="s1525">But I didn't.</span> <span id="s1526">One of these days --</span></p> <p><span id="s1527">Q: What do you metaphorically hold onto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">A: What do I metaphorically do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">Q: What do you metaphorically hold onto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">A: Metaphorically I hold on to -- I just think of giving you the first thing I thought, staying on top.</span> <span id="s1531">Which is in control.</span> <span id="s1532">I -- Joan knows about it, I told her about it.</span> <span id="s1533">At Sloan-Kettering or wherever, they have trouble putting me to sleep, I will not do it.</span> <span id="s1534">They say, “Shut up already, we'll give you something.”</span> <span id="s1535">Because if I'm anesthetized, I don't feel anything, I'm not in control.</span> <span id="s1536">This has come back to 19 -- f -- I would say to the concentration -- I didn't have this before the war.</span> <span id="s1537">I was like everybody else, if I had to have something.</span> <span id="s1538">After the concentration camp, I will not be in the dark till it's dark.</span> <span id="s1539">“Death shall have no dominion.”</span> <span id="s1540">Death had it's dominion in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s1541">And Paul always says to me when he meets me, he said, “You are amazing.</span> <span id="s1542">You still alive.”</span> <span id="s1543">I said, “Yes, but so are you.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">Q: Because of you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1546">He says, “But I'm much more depressed than you.”</span> <span id="s1547">I said, “That's why I divorced you.”</span> <span id="s1548">I tell you -- no, I -- you should see my sister, my sister is two years younger and she's at least in looks and in behavior, at least 95 years old.</span> <span id="s1549">And we don't get along because she feels that I'm too theatrical, too outgoing, too this, too that, too rigot whatever.</span> <span id="s1550">Tough.</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">Q: Do you have fun?</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">Q: I have fun, most of the time.</span> <span id="s1554">But if I don't have fun, I also find how to get myself out of the pit.</span> <span id="s1555">I have new -- new therapies.</span> <span id="s1556">First of all I have book which is ideal, which is “The Erroneous Zones,” not the erogenous zones.</span> <span id="s1557">And that book answers many questions from why do you do this or why do you that.</span> <span id="s1558">If I'm really depressed I read it.</span> <span id="s1559">I don't remember it, but I know it.</span> <span id="s1560">I found a way, this fall, when I was terribly depressed, I was angry, bitter, lonely, I didn't want to be 78, didn't want to live.</span> <span id="s1561">And I told myself, “You got to do something because otherwise you end up paying 100 dollars an hour to talk about the crap.”</span> <span id="s1562">So that done it.</span> <span id="s1563">So what did I do?</span> <span id="s1564">I decided I wear, every day, besides clean underwear, which I do anyway, every day something different.</span> <span id="s1565">Even if you're alone.</span> <span id="s1566">Don't wear the same T-shirt, though you wash it.</span> <span id="s1567">Wear some jewelry.</span> <span id="s1568">You always wear lipstick.</span> <span id="s1569">So do it.</span> <span id="s1570">I've not been really depressed any more.</span> <span id="s1571">I found the way.</span> <span id="s1572">That happened in -- around my birthday in November.</span> <span id="s1573">Now it's February, I'm doing okay.</span> <span id="s1574">But I forced myself.</span> <span id="s1575">Do it, make a plan, finish every day something, even if it is crud, but do it.</span> <span id="s1576">And don't watch so much television, now again.</span> <span id="s1577">O.J. I didn't watch, but this Clinton thing.</span> <span id="s1578">Okay.</span> <span id="s1579">Questions?</span></p> <p><span id="s1580">Q: You had mentioned, and correct me if I'm -- if I'm not remembering well, your nickname was Gaga?</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">A: G-Gacka.</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">Q: Gacka.</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">A: G-a-c-k-a, which is talker, yakker.</span> <span id="s1584">I must already have done this when I was a kid, couldn't shut up.</span> <span id="s1585">My husband used to say, “You talk the air away.”</span> <span id="s1586">But then now, I'm alone and I don't talk to anybody, sometimes for days.</span> <span id="s1587">And if you have an interview, you're supposed to say, you're supposed to talk.</span> <span id="s1588">No, I've learned to shut up.</span> <span id="s1589">I can shut up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">Q: How would your parents feel about you doing these interviews, about you talking about all of this, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">A: How would they feel if they -- why do you think I don't show my family the tapes?</span> <span id="s1592">Because there are things I already did as a child, I talked about the impossible things.</span> <span id="s1593">I wanted them to be more open, more direct, less hypocritical.</span> <span id="s1594">My sister is two years younger, she is much more 19th century than I am.</span> <span id="s1595">She married a guy whose third wife she was, who named their first daughter after his first wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">Q: Whew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">A: I don't have to say anything else.</span> <span id="s1598">You can imagine how the relationship is between mother and daughter today.</span> <span id="s1599">It's totally fucked up.</span> <span id="s1600">The daughter became a lesbian.</span> <span id="s1601">Now, at the ripe old age of 45.</span> <span id="s1602">And married and divorced and ah.</span> <span id="s1603">Now I want you to shut off the thing.</span> <span id="s1604">Because I'm talking about something -- End of Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">Conclusion of Interview</span></p> <p><span
