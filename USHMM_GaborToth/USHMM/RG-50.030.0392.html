<span id="s21">The name of my parents were Leopold Hahn and Clotilde Hahn.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: Can you tell us something about your parents, and your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: My parents were distant relations.</span> <span id="s24">My mother didn’t change her name when she got married.</span> <span id="s25">She was born Hahn and sh-she -- both parents were born around Vienna, in small places.</span> <span id="s26">But late -- the most of the time, my mother grew up in Shtockerau, this is a little town near Vienna, where my grandparents had a shop.</span> <span id="s27">They were s-selling bicycles, motorbikes and sewing machines in -- in Shtockerau.</span> <span id="s28">And there they had a little house and had the four children.</span> <span id="s29">My mother was the second one.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: And tell me -- can you tell me about your parents, what you remember about what they were like and what they did?</span> <span id="s31">I understand --</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: My -- my father had learned to be -- he was the youngest of nine children in a village and when -- the older children were sent to school, but when he was growing up, he was sent to -- to -- to a -- to learn to be a -- a kilner -- as a -- a waiter.</span> <span id="s33">And I -- and he -- later on, when he had finished his time to learn, he went to Nitsa, to the Riviera and to Francesbath and Karlsbath, these are baths in -- in Czechoslovaki -- to -- to work.</span> <span id="s34">And then he worked in Vienna and s -- after the war -- and he was a soldier then, in the first World War.</span> <span id="s35">He was an invalid.</span> <span id="s36">He was -- his right shoulder was broken in the war and he could never lift his right hand any more.</span> <span id="s37">He was an invalid.</span> <span id="s38">But he came back -- he was a prisoner in Russia, but he came back half a year before the war ended.</span> <span id="s39">He escaped.</span> <span id="s40">And when he escaped, back home -- this was in spring 1918, he came back.</span> <span id="s41">I do remember that.</span> <span id="s42">I was four years old, yes, because I had to learn a -- a poem to say to him.</span> <span id="s43">This was -- and had flowers in my hand and was four years old and I didn’t know actu -- actually was -- what a father was.</span> <span id="s44">My mother told me -- was always talking about the Papa and she told me that one day I came home from the park and said, a child has said to a mum -- to a man, “Papa,” and it was for me -- as -- as -- I don’t know what I imagined a Papa is.</span> <span id="s45">And -- and so the Papa came.</span> <span id="s46">And this I do re -- I still remember --</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: Do you remember --</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: -- the excitement of when he came.</span> <span id="s49">I do remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: Do you remember the poem that you said to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: No, of course not.</span> <span id="s52">No.</span> <span id="s53">But I had to -- to -- we had always to learn poems, at birthplace and I -- his -- I suppose this must be a Victorian -- a Victorian ritual.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: Was it strange as well as exciting to have this person come in whom you didn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: Oh, I -- I -- I -- I don -- I took it, I suppose, and -- but itcho said children didn’t -- I didn’t know what a Papa is.</span> <span id="s56">Could have been a dog and -- and then I noticed that it is a man and my mother of course thought that I know what a Papa is.</span> <span id="s57">This is --</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: And when were your sisters born?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: My sister was born on the fifth of March, 1915, she was born.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: And this is Hansie, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: No, Mim -- Mari -- Mimi -- Maria was actually her name, after some relations who had died, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: And did your parents own a restaurant?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: Not at that ti-time, but m-my father established then the first restaurant, when he came back from -- when -- he -- he didn’t go into -- not -- not work any more, so he established a restaurant.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: Was that fun, as a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s66">I don’t -- this I don’t know.</span> <span id="s67">We were always kept very separate.</span> <span id="s68">Children were very separate from their parents.</span> <span id="s69">Too much.</span> <span id="s70">My mother said once to me -- later on, now -- that she only regrets that she was not more with her children.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: So she was working in the restaurant?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: No, she -- she was not working directly, but she was there.</span> <span id="s73">I don’t -- she was not cooking or anything, but she was there.</span> <span id="s74">They had to cook and all that and -- but of course she -- she supervised -- that and helped.</span> <span id="s75">She was very, very close to my father and they worked very, very good together and this was a very, very good relationship.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: And your other sister, Hansie, when was she born?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: She was born after the -- after the war.</span> <span id="s78">She was born 1921, on the first of July, 1921, after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: So what was it like in your home to grow up, as you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: We had always somebody -- somebody to look after us.</span> <span id="s81">Some maids or anything.</span> <span id="s82">I do remember the last one, she was for years with us.</span> <span id="s83">She had a kindergarten course.</span> <span id="s84">But -- but it was a separate life from the parents, of course, because in a restaurant, y -- you worked too -- always, day and night.</span> <span id="s85">As a -- on somedays -- in what I can remember my parents did -- because in -- in the langerstein, what I remember, this restaurant was in the center of Vienna and it was more or less as a -- for people who are working there and came for lunch and evening and then my -- the people were not working on Saturday and so my parents closed th -- closed on Saturday -- on -- not on Saturday, on Sunday.</span> <span id="s86">On Sunday it was closed.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: Did -- did you have much of a religious identity when you grew up?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: We did know we are Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: You did know, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: But -- but not religious upbringing.</span> <span id="s91">At first the maids what we had, they were all Catholics, but we -- th-they didn’t take us to church or anything.</span> <span id="s92">And in -- in my -- in -- in -- in my primary school, I do remember as a -- I do remember we went sometimes to what was called Yugenkotestines.</span> <span id="s93">To versidenshteten, as this was the synagogue.</span> <span id="s94">And for me is -- the synagogue still is the nicest synagogue in the world.</span> <span id="s95">That -- we went there as -- to rab -- Rabbi Heiss, he was a very famous rabbi -- what I heard later, pere -- and I do remember sissyougotastanst.</span> <span id="s96">I do remember we sang a song in German, it -- the Torah got -- do you understand German a bit?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: A little.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: The Torah gotas labbit unz desala imital.</span> <span id="s99">This was the beginning.</span> <span id="s100">This --</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: Will you translate it for us?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: Atho the Torah gotas labbit unz is -- is -- gives us -- cares for us, maybe.</span> <span id="s103">Cares for us always -- imital.</span> <span id="s104">This was -- I do remember the beginning of that song we sang in the Yugotestines.</span> <span id="s105">And I liked to go there -- I liked to go there.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: Did -- when you were in school and -- and at home, you were playing with friends, you had Jewish and non-Jewish friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: More non-Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: More non-Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: There weren’t -- where we lived, there were not many Jews.</span> <span id="s110">We were only three in class.</span> <span id="s111">And there were more non-Jewish friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: Did you experience any discrimination because you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: I didn’t understand it at that time and I didn’t feel discriminated, but now I know that there was, from the teacher.</span> <span id="s114">Because now I -- I still remember that my teacher ask me few times which langa -- language we are speaking at home.</span> <span id="s115">My parents couldn’t speak -- only German -- they couldn’t speak a foreign language, but I suppose she expected Yiddish or Polnish.</span> <span id="s116">And -- and at that time, I didn’t connect this with anti-Semitisms, but now I know.</span> <span id="s117">And then another thing, what I didn’t understand at that time, was -- I had, in every subject the best mark, one -- it was a one.</span> <span id="s118">Only in German, I had a -- a bad -- a -- a -- a two.</span> <span id="s119">This is not such a good mark.</span> <span id="s120">And when I came to the gimnasium, this was in -- in -- in -- in the school as a -- when I came to the gimnasium, I never had anything else than -- than very good.</span> <span id="s121">And my abbietour is even -- I wrote on very good.</span> <span id="s122">S-So I can’t believe that my German, as a child, was so bad that I had a -- I deserved a -- a -- a bad mark.</span> <span id="s123">I suppose this was pure anti-Semitism -- that she thought a Jewish child can’t speak proper German.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: What was your relationship to your two sisters?</span> <span id="s125">Were you -- you were fairly close in age, at least --</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: To?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: To your sisters.</span> <span id="s128">Your relationship with your sisters --</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: Yeah my -- my sister -- wa-was from birth very short-sighted.</span> <span id="s130">She sees -- runs in the family, my grandmother was shortsighted.</span> <span id="s131">And I had always to look after her, this I do remember.</span> <span id="s132">And she was -- even when -- when she grew up, she was always a bit jealous of me.</span> <span id="s133">When -- I had to look after her and to take her as I -- she was not trusted to go alone, I had always to take her.</span> <span id="s134">And s -- and she was always a bit jealous and still is.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: That’s -- that’s the youngest daughter, Mimi?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: I had to take her -- Mimi, mat -- Mimi -- I had to take her w-when I had dates, when I was a -- I had to take her to all my dates.</span> <span id="s137">I was not allowed to go on my own.</span> <span id="s138">It was a -- a -- a -- for years, when I -- or when I was invited for a birthday party, I had to ask if I can bring my do -- my sister, too.</span> <span id="s139">But she -- she didn’t have friends.</span> <span id="s140">She always was as o -- some ba -- hanging on -- my appendings.</span> <span id="s141">And this was not a good -- this was not very good for me and not good for her.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: Now why did she have to be your companion on dates?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: Yeah, this -- I suppose my -- my parents thought this is quite an insurance in that way, that we are always together, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: When did you start dating?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: When I started dating?</span> <span id="s146">I was -- I wasn’t allowed to date.</span> <span id="s147">This is -- I was then in -- up -- up to 14, I was in a girl’s school, because I didn’t go to the gimnasium at 11, and actually I was in the normal school what ended at 14.</span> <span id="s148">And in the restaurant there was a professor who liked to talk to us.</span> <span id="s149">Usually we were not allowed to talk to the guests, but he wa -- talked to us and he told my parents, or my father, he should let me start there.</span> <span id="s150">This was -- it was in -- Schpitzer was his name.</span> <span id="s151">It was a sectione [indecipherable] technical high school -- so in the techn -- techn -- in Vienna.</span> <span id="s152">And then -- after 14, I came to the gimnasi -- into the gimnasium.</span> <span id="s153">And up to 14, there were only girls.</span> <span id="s154">We were not allowed to play with boys, or anything, no.</span> <span id="s155">I suppose my father, in a restaurant, has seen too much, so he tried to be sure that his girls are kept properly.</span> <span id="s156">And wh-when I came to the other school, this was a special class for peop -- for girls -- as a -- for children, who come from this normal -- from this school -- from this -- to the gimnasium.</span> <span id="s157">And this was in a boy’s school, in this class.</span> <span id="s158">We were only -- the only girls among 500 boys.</span> <span id="s159">And here were -- I was -- I met that first time, boys, but I didn’t date -- I wasn’t -- didn’t date or anything, no.</span> <span id="s160">And -- I wasn’t allowed to go out in the afternoon, at all.</span> <span id="s161">And later on, I joined the socialistition middulshula pund.</span> <span id="s162">And then I was on -- this was from six with eight, as a -- not in -- deny it or anything.</span> <span id="s163">And I was only -- every weekend -- I was only allowed to go every fortnight.</span> <span id="s164">Every -- every week was for my father too much.</span> <span id="s165">And I was only every fortnight allowed to go.</span> <span id="s166">And in -- in this asa socialistition middulshula pund there were from other schools, too, and girls and boys.</span> <span id="s167">And there I met Peppy, in that -- in that -- but he was not in the same sc-school as I was.</span> <span id="s168">He was in hominastation gimnasium.</span> <span id="s169">He learned Greek and Latin.</span> <span id="s170">I learned French and Latin.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: Why did you join that group?</span> <span id="s172">The middleshula --</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: My father was a social -- was a member of the s -- of the socialle democratition partae.</span> <span id="s174">This was allowed.</span> <span id="s175">This he was.</span> <span id="s176">And I know they came all with somebody to -- when -- because he paid a membership to the -- to that club.</span> <span id="s177">And I know once, this man sold him, as a book -- gaves him some tickets for a picture that -- and when it came to that, my parents didn’t want to go.</span> <span id="s178">And then they said we should go.</span> <span id="s179">And we went, my -- my sister and I, we went to -- to that place.</span> <span id="s180">This was in Weedenhopstrassie, where -- where we went.</span> <span id="s181">And then we had -- at first had, and -- and when they saw new people coming, and those three boys -- three young men, accompanied us at home, walked us home.</span> <span id="s182">And then we got -- come in touch with them, through that.</span> <span id="s183">There was -- the leader of the group was Bruno Kaiska.</span> <span id="s184">It was in his district.</span> <span id="s185">He had been living in the same district, his family, as I grew up.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: Where was Hansie?</span> <span id="s187">How were you -- how were you --</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: Hansie was much younger and she was very spoiled, because my father hadn’t seen bringing us up.</span> <span id="s189">She was the only one he had seen grown -- growing up, because at -- at that time he was aw-away, as a soldier.</span> <span id="s190">And she was very spoiled and I had to -- in -- later on, a very good relationship to her.</span> <span id="s191">She was nearer to me than my other sister.</span> <span id="s192">And when it -- when she had somewhere to go, it was always me who had -- who -- who went with her and so on.</span> <span id="s193">We had a very good relationship.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: Did you love reading from a very early age?</span> <span id="s195">Did you start reading very young, and reading a lot?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: Not s -- not so much, no.</span> <span id="s197">No, only later, because, as I told you, we were under s -- very strict control.</span> <span id="s198">My mother controlled the books we had read, yes.</span> <span id="s199">We were very, very strictly brought up.</span> <span id="s200">And as a -- I couldn’t choose many.</span> <span id="s201">I sa -- I was reading in the restaurant.</span> <span id="s202">We had what they called salated sipter as a -- and in the restaurant I wrote the newspapers, all newspapers, in -- and -- and this [indecipherable] was, these were magazines, who were changed regularly, for the restaurant and th-this I read.</span> <span id="s203">And I know -- I had not -- no proper children’s book or something, because only that.</span> <span id="s204">And I know at school we were then ask once, to -- what we have read, to write.</span> <span id="s205">And I wrote about a book I have read.</span> <span id="s206">This was the -- the -- the fourlits taleebee dershernotfa airtrabbit.</span> <span id="s207">This means the last laugh of the beautiful airtrabbit.</span> <span id="s208">So airtrabbit mea -- is Hungar -- which is --means Elizabeth.</span> <span id="s209">And my teacher called me and said I should read different books, because is -- she didn’t find it as proper as I -- what I have written, yeah.</span> <span id="s210">And this I do remember.</span> <span id="s211">And then I got -- so later on I got -- I was a very avid reader then, later on.</span> <span id="s212">This was a secret domain, what I wanted to explore.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s214">Tell me how you met Peppy.</span> <span id="s215">You met him -- met him at a group?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: I met him -- I have -- I -- he was in same group, but he didn’t impress me at all.</span> <span id="s217">And he -- we had every -- ev -- at -- at my school, in the grammar school, we had every year a ball, on the day when we got the half te -- when the end of that term was.</span> <span id="s218">And at that ball, he was and he said he danced with me, but he didn’t impress me at all.</span> <span id="s219">I didn’t kn -- didn’t even know it, that he had danced with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: Now, is --</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: Yeah and -- and when I -- I was very, very happy girl, I loved school, I didn’t work at school.</span> <span id="s224">I ha -- I -- I was not -- not a hard worker, I -- I didn’t work at all, I think.</span> <span id="s225">I -- I -- I -- it was more entertainment that work, this school.</span> <span id="s226">And I went out with boys.</span> <span id="s227">Not only with one, with that and that and that.</span> <span id="s228">And was very happy with it.</span> <span id="s229">And my mother was not in Vienna and she had written once to me, I should buy something for her and send it to her.</span> <span id="s230">And I went with a boy to -- to that shop in -- in Vienna.</span> <span id="s231">This was not -- it was a friend.</span> <span id="s232">I went out with -- with Peppy and with his friend and didn’t -- didn’t mean to me and I went out with him.</span> <span id="s233">This was in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s234">I got wet, it was -- started to rain and he took me to his mother, to dry me.</span> <span id="s235">And she dried me, offered me strawberries with cream and the gramophone was put up and we were dancing and it was very ca -- very nice afternoon.</span> <span id="s236">But in the evening, in the same day, it -- I had a date with Peppy, his friend.</span> <span id="s237">And I -- I didn’t take it ser -- I didn’t want to go away.</span> <span id="s238">I liked the dancing and I left him.</span> <span id="s239">I didn’t go.</span> <span id="s240">And he was waiting for me.</span> <span id="s241">It was at eight o’clock.</span> <span id="s242">And I didn’t come.</span> <span id="s243">So he went to his friend.</span> <span id="s244">And he appeared there.</span> <span id="s245">When -- he danced with me and told me off, when he -- wh -- during the dance, because I didn’t come to the date.</span> <span id="s246">And -- and so it-- it was a hap -- very hap -- and so I -- it was nothing special.</span> <span id="s247">And Wolfgang, the other -- names in the -- name of the other was Wolfgang and Wolfgang walked me home, but Peppy had -- could not walk me home because he had always to be at 10 o’clock home and with his mother.</span> <span id="s248">His mother was -- as -- didn’t -- this was -- and -- and then these two young men said, “I am going out with -- with her.”</span> <span id="s249">The one said and the other said.</span> <span id="s250">And once I had a date with one and a third one came, with a letter -- I should choose between the two.</span> <span id="s251">This letter happened to be there.</span> <span id="s252">This -- this was Werner Felner, it was a third one from the group.</span> <span id="s253">And -- and then I choose, not Peppy, I choose Wolfgang.</span> <span id="s254">And -- but I was not seriously interested to go out with him.</span> <span id="s255">And I went then on holiday to San Kilton and didn’t write any more.</span> <span id="s256">This is -- it was -- it -- it -- it was ver -- it was nothing serious.</span> <span id="s257">And there, so it dropped up and a year later, or something, I -- I am got -- once I got -- I had to go to -- I wanted to go to the national library, I was writing an essay for school.</span> <span id="s258">And Peppy offered me to -- to show me the ropes in the library.</span> <span id="s259">It’s a national library, where I hadn’t been before.</span> <span id="s260">And he went with me and at that -- at that excursion we -- I should, of course ha -- have my sister on my side and had -- have to meet her, but we didn’t -- we let her -- let her and I didn’t come to the national library and this was the beginning of -- of the relationship.</span> <span id="s261">He was -- as of we -- we were -- I didn’t go to the national li-library and I didn’t see the ropes and we were talking and this was the beginning of our relationship.</span> <span id="s262">And my sister, I left.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: You left?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s265">And she was complaining.</span> <span id="s266">She was very, very -- I -- I mean it was a mad idea to -- always to have my sister on my side.</span> <span id="s267">We -- sometimes when we -- she came home, she complained to my mother that -- that our talk was not all right.</span> <span id="s268">She -- we were talking about the -- both -- all high school students, about different subjects, where she couldn’t join in and she complained to my mother.</span> <span id="s269">And s -- and it was an -- a terrible relationshi -- terrible -- you shouldn’t do that to children.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: Was -- Peppy’s name was Josef [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: Josef, yes.</span> <span id="s272">Josef Olsenfet.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: So where does Peppy come from?</span> <span id="s274">Is -- was that the -- was that a nickname he had that you gave him?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: No, everybody in every -- Josef is like here Bill.</span> <span id="s276">It is -- Peppy is -- is -- all J-Josephs are called Peppy in Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: This is -- I do -- I think it comes from the Italian, I don’t know where is comes from, but this is like you here call Williams, Bill.</span> <span id="s279">This is nothing special.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: E-Edith, as you’re -- you graduated gimnasium in 1933?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: So, during this period of time, things are going on in Germany, the Nazi party was --</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: Are you hearing about this and concerned about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: Yeah, we heard the -- we heard about it, of course we heard and all that, that Hitler had -- had taken over, but it was somewhere very away.</span> <span id="s286">As we -- we did not expect to -- to be mixed up with it.</span> <span id="s287">We heard at that time --Thomas Mann came from -- from Germany, and he had a talk in -- in Vienna.</span> <span id="s288">It was a -- a closed talk.</span> <span id="s289">It was for members of the Socialist party, as all the talk, but I don’t know how I got a ticket, but I had one and I know he started with the way -- with the words, “I don’t know what the evening f-for you means,” Evast evostat vas der a verseebadoit, that for -- for you means, “but for me it means more.”</span> <span id="s290">Famil fermish it itboided mere.</span> <span id="s291">This was his first words and he explained them why he cannot be a Nazi, why he -- he -- he was jouar -- as a -- is against it.</span> <span id="s292">This I do remember.</span> <span id="s293">And then at that time, Airish Kessler came fr-from Austria -- to Austria from -- from Germany and of course I heard him too.</span> <span id="s294">And all of this and it -- when we -- and I was interested of course, what happened.</span> <span id="s295">I read the Kampf.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: You did?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: Yes, I did.</span> <span id="s298">No, of course ammen -- as somebody who is interested in things, I was used to look into books.</span> <span id="s299">And I read not only the Kampf.</span> <span id="s300">I read Will Rosenberg too.</span> <span id="s301">This was a racial -- a racialist books.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: I have read that, too.</span> <span id="s304">Although the Kampf was for me so vulgar.</span> <span id="s305">Even the language.</span> <span id="s306">I love German and I -- it was very, very, I -- as I loved the language very, very much at that time and I ha --was widely read at that time and the -- the -- the writing, the German only, even the language, it was so vulgar.</span> <span id="s307">And, what he wrote about it, that I couldn’t believe that this can make an -- an impression.</span> <span id="s308">It was an awful book.</span> <span id="s309">Not only -- even when you -- objective -- not as a Jew, even when you objective, to go to the -- and -- and funny enough, I have read -- later now -- a book by Gola Mann, this is the son of Thomas Mann.</span> <span id="s310">It -- it is called, “An Yugen -- Youth in Germany”.</span> <span id="s311">And in that book, he had the same, this -- he wrote about the Kampf too and he wrote about the same.</span> <span id="s312">He wrote -- he wrote in the book too, what an awful book it is and how awful the language is.</span> <span id="s313">See he -- he -- and -- and so, as a -- I couldn’t believe that this can be of any -- o-o-of any meaning to anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: Did you read it before 1933?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: I think -- I -- I can’t say that, but I think ye -- I think yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: Before, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s318">I think I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: So then it must have been a shock to you when he became Chancellor in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: Yeah, it was, of course it was a shock.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: And what did you think of Rosenberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: No, Rosen -- silly.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: Silly?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: Silly, yes.</span> <span id="s325">About these racial differences and -- and -- silly.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: Did you, during this period of time, notice thing change -- noticing things changing in Austria?</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: Oth -- in Austria they came then -- the Schushnik periods, sess so chare der mokhaven were forbidden as a party and the libraries were cleaned, so we chose not to go to the library any more.</span> <span id="s328">And I -- we joined then -- I had a friend who brought me in touch with foiervare -- with the fire, foiervare -- this is the people who look, oh -- who are against fires when the fire breaks out.</span> <span id="s329">And -- and we were in that library then, they had a very, very good library, because we didn’t want -- we didn’t want the abbetob library any more, because they were cleaned of books.</span> <span id="s330">This was in the Schushniksat and I’ve -- when the fartallend de shiffront was -- the -- was rolling and I -- we -- I was in -- sometimes at meetings, at forbidden meetings in -- with Bruno Kisekey.</span> <span id="s331">There was -- I do remember we -- there was a political meeting and we were told, should the police come butsolt -- it is a singing, a choir meeting, what we had to sing.</span> <span id="s332">I was in these meetings, yes.</span> <span id="s333">And when I was in Itew University, after ‘33, colleagues -- I think it was my reputation, approached me to -- to join illical coop.</span> <span id="s334">And ex-explained to me the selsese thame, how it works, that you have a different name and you know only the people of -- of -- of the -- this little group, so -- and all this he explained to me.</span> <span id="s335">He was studying physics and I must say, I was inclined to join.</span> <span id="s336">And Peppy was the one who said, “You can’t do it.”</span> <span id="s337">Because ‘36, when my -- at that time -- my father had died and he said.</span> <span id="s338">“You can’t do -- you can’t do that, you could be arrested and think of your mother, and you can’t.”</span> <span id="s339">And he kept me.</span> <span id="s340">He was the sensible one in that thing.</span> <span id="s341">But I was inclined to join the illeeka -- the -- the anti-Fascist ishas underground ot -- at the university.</span> <span id="s342">But I didn’t, in the end.</span> <span id="s343">But this young man, this student who wanted to -- to get me to it, he happened -- what I didn’t know at that time, he happened to be a cousin of a friend of mine.</span> <span id="s344">He didn’t -- but I didn’t know it at that time and he’s not alive any more and when he came to London, he rang me up.</span> <span id="s345">Years, years, years after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: Why do you think he thought -- he approached you?</span> <span id="s347">What sort of a reputation did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: I suppose I -- as a Socialist.</span> <span id="s349">I had a reputation as a Socialist.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: Why -- what -- can I go back a little bit?</span> <span id="s351">Why did you decide you wanted to go to law school?</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: Why I bisish --</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: Yeah, how did that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A: Oh, this is very simple.</span> <span id="s355">I -- in the restaurant, I read all the papers and there was a case th -- what’s it call?</span> <span id="s356">How was it called?</span> <span id="s357">There was a Jewish -- a -- a -- a Jewish boy, a young man, who had -- who was in the Alps -- is a very famous came and h-he was walking and his father fell down and died.</span> <span id="s358">And he was sent -- a-accused of murdering his father and he was sentenced.</span> <span id="s359">I read it in every paper, what it -- how wa -- as I didn’t know the name always.</span> <span id="s360">It’s a very famous case.</span> <span id="s361">They say th -- they say, Austrian drifels case, they -- they called it.</span> <span id="s362">And he was sentenced -- yeah, in -- in -- it’s a case.</span> <span id="s363">It’s a proof of -- it’s a court.</span> <span id="s364">They came with the Oed-Oedipus complex and with such nonsense and toos -- and he was sentenced to -- a-after two years in prison, he was -- some -- and so he came out and he came to America and he became one of a famous phot-photographer here.</span> <span id="s365">He has photographed everybody who had a name here, but I -- I --</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: It’s not Eisenstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: Hm?</span> <span id="s368">Not Eisen -- no, not Eisenstadt.</span> <span id="s369">He was -- I sa -- I will -- it will come to me later on.</span> <span id="s370">And I -- I -- and this brought me to the -- to -- to know.</span> <span id="s371">I had such feeling -- I want -- I wanted to come -- to learn more about it, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s373">Did the fact that Peppy was also going to law school --</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: He was -- yes, but this didn’t -- he was a year in front of me, but this was not -- my father wanted me actually to study medicine.</span> <span id="s375">He liked a woman in a white coat.</span> <span id="s376">And he had -- yes -- and I was already at the university to -- to go to -- to medic -- to en-enroll for medicine.</span> <span id="s377">And then I got him around to go to law school.</span> <span id="s378">But I was already -- you had -- when you went, you had to hire a -- a ca -- a -- a closet for anatomy and I was supposed to do this with a -- with another one, but the other one came at that time, nin asa somewhere, it didn’t come and later on I got my father to agree that I go to law school.</span> <span id="s379">But he wanted -- he was -- as of -- wanted me to study, made it seem.</span> <span id="s380">But I wouldn’t have made a good doctor.</span> <span id="s381">I was too sensitive for that, no.</span> <span id="s382">And I didn’t -- I thought this -- tha -- so I come to -- came to law.</span> <span id="s383">And I loved it from the first moment.</span> <span id="s384">But it was after -- after the first Shtatakson.</span> <span id="s385">This you do in Austria in Roman law -- in church law.</span> <span id="s386">I had to learn church law.</span> <span id="s387">And -- and in all German law.</span> <span id="s388">I did it without any special course.</span> <span id="s389">There are special courses for, but I -- I didn’t bother to go to.</span> <span id="s390">I couldn’t -- I didn’t want -- I always didn’t want to be too expensive for my parents.</span> <span id="s391">This was always my -- didn’t want it to have to pay a course for me.</span> <span id="s392">And -- and -- but I -- I passed the exam and after the exam, I -- I was -- I didn’t -- I decided not to do anything.</span> <span id="s393">This was in April, somewhere, after three terms.</span> <span id="s394">And when I decided not to do anything after the old term, just to be free.</span> <span id="s395">Just to get out and just [inaudible], and I did.</span> <span id="s396">You had to -- you had to belake, it was called belake -- as a -- to choose what you want to hear.</span> <span id="s397">And I had only one lecture, a nine -- nine hour lecture a week, only.</span> <span id="s398">And 11 ho -- 11 hours was a minimum, but it was three years as a only silliness that I didn’t have more, that I had took only s -- nine lectures.</span> <span id="s399">And when I came forth to -- when I wanted to -- for the s-second sht -- state exam, after eight terms, I was told em -- is -- a term is missing.</span> <span id="s400">I have only nine hours and this doesn’t count.</span> <span id="s401">I have to make -- to stay another half a year.</span> <span id="s402">I went to sittykarn and everywhere, it was hopeless, hopeless.</span> <span id="s403">I was very unhappy, you can imagine.</span> <span id="s404">I was prepared to end -- to go to the exam and this silliness would have code -- code me half a year.</span> <span id="s405">And I didn’t say to anybody -- not to my mother, not to anybody, and one colleague, I told it, one [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s406">He said to me -- he came a few days ago to me and said if I want to -- if I want, a colleague, another colleague wants to meet me, he was the son of the first attorney in -- in Austria and his secre -- his friend was secretary of the Minister of Education.</span> <span id="s407">This was ‘37 already, in the -- in the Schushnik time.</span> <span id="s408">I said, “Yes, I want to meet him.”</span> <span id="s409">And he made me -- and itta -- as a -- an appointment with the secretary of the Minister of Education.</span> <span id="s410">This was, at that time, Baron Parasini.</span> <span id="s411">I went to the ministry and met this colleague.</span> <span id="s412">He received me with hand cuss -- hand kiss and -- and he said to me to make an application and the law was changed.</span> <span id="s413">For my sake, the law was changed, from -- it is in my book.</span> <span id="s414">When you have -- when you have the book, it is in my book from -- from that time on, nine hours are enough -- for -- to -- at that time -- this was already in the Schushnik time and I went -- sent to the uni -- netiskotes over the university.</span> <span id="s415">I made the -- the application through the university, through the Minister of Education, I have met him.</span> <span id="s416">And -- and I get it -- got it back through the university and then I said, “Now, you see, I can -- it’s all right.”</span> <span id="s417">And [indecipherable] said to me that God can do everything, he said to me.</span> <span id="s418">And he mentioned for my sake was a -- a law changed at the university.</span> <span id="s419">In my -- in one of these papers, in my papers, there it is written in it, that nine hours are enough from now on, to -- for a term.</span> <span id="s420">It was in the Shushnik time and there was a Jew and -- when it is -- I didn’t feel as -- I still wonder how it happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: Tell me when -- was your fath -- did your father die suddenly, did he have an illness?</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: Yeah, he died suddenly.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: So that must have been a very big shock for everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: Yes, it was.</span> <span id="s425">He was only 50, he was never ill.</span> <span id="s426">He was never ill and he died of a heart attack.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: So that changed --</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: Yeah, he wa -- he -- he died actually in Bartkastan.</span> <span id="s429">At that time, he -- we -- he had sold his -- his restaurant and he was manager in a Jewish hotel in Bartkastan, the only Jewish hotel which was allowed there, it was.</span> <span id="s430">And he -- he came there and he died in May, and so he -- he died there, yes.</span> <span id="s431">It was a -- a big shock for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: And how did things change for the family then?</span> <span id="s433">You were living [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: We were in Vinia -- were in Vienna and we got a telegram.</span> <span id="s435">My mother and -- and her brother went with her and he was buried in Vienna.</span> <span id="s436">He was brought to Vienna because he -- so that we can go to his grave at least.</span> <span id="s437">He was buried in Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: So you -- were you living still at home, while you were going to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s440">Yes, yes, I -- we -- I was living at home.</span> <span id="s441">I was a student at that time.</span> <span id="s442">‘36 he died, on the third of June, ‘36.</span> <span id="s443">Thirteens of Sivon is his -- yeah, yeah, it’s that, thirteen of Sivon.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: And your mother then had to go to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: My -- no, my mother was -- established herself as a dressmaker.</span> <span id="s446">She had, when she was young, she had made the -- what you call in wein the master.</span> <span id="s447">In -- in -- in -- in Austria there is a giltsistin, not like her, that an-anybody can establish themself.</span> <span id="s448">This -- and he had made -- had made the -- the exams, the speci -- all necessary, to be a dressmaker and now she -- she had worked as a dressmaker during the first World War, when my father was a soldier.</span> <span id="s449">And because at that time you didn’t get so much money, then in the second -- in the second World War, Hitler was very generous with money and -- and he was -- and now she established herself again as a dressmaker.</span> <span id="s450">And we had always work, or so it was.</span> <span id="s451">She had even an employee at that time, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: So you didn’t have to work at that time?</span> <span id="s453">You were still going to school --</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: I wa -- yeah, I always worked, when I was at school.</span> <span id="s455">I always worked, I always gave lessons for -- as a -- to -- as a student and I always wanted to be independent.</span> <span id="s456">I always wanted to have pocket money and so I came to my friend.</span> <span id="s457">I said my -- this was my -- in -- in the same house where I live -- where we lived, there lived a coup -- a family, Christina Denner.</span> <span id="s458">As a -- she lost her mother when she was 14.</span> <span id="s459">There were two girls and her father was looking for somebody to help the girls to come as a -- for the -- in the school, because you can imagine when the mother is ill of TB, that the girls were not very much involved in school.</span> <span id="s460">And I was recommended to him.</span> <span id="s461">I had a good name and a good reputation in [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s462">And it was a house -- the concierge of the house.</span> <span id="s463">And I was recommended.</span> <span id="s464">I did -- I say -- I have seen them.</span> <span id="s465">They were living in the same house, because everybody had a dog and went out with the dog.</span> <span id="s466">But I didn’t know them.</span> <span id="s467">And so I came in that house and I was then every afternoon in that house and the father was never there.</span> <span id="s468">Two girls of 14 and 11 were living on their own, practically.</span> <span id="s469">All on their own.</span> <span id="s470">And I was like -- I go to them and li -- as -- at first I -- I went to them to earn some money, but I was then like the elder sister.</span> <span id="s471">I was involved in everything and they came, like girls with everything to me.</span> <span id="s472">I went to school to ask how they are getting on.</span> <span id="s473">She went said, to the hundersackademi and I helped her, so she passed the hundersackademi.</span> <span id="s474">And -- and so it came that we were so near to each other, because there was nobody and I liked them.</span> <span id="s475">We -- we -- I know I wrote even a love letter for her when she had with her boyfriend the quarrel and she only copied it.</span> <span id="s476">Yes, so -- as a so -- so -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: -- near to each other, because there was nobody and I liked her.</span> <span id="s478">We -- we -- I know I wrote even a love letter for her when she had with her boyfriend the quarrel and she only copied it.</span> <span id="s479">Yes, so -- as a so -- so near was our relationship.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: And what was the difference in age between you and Christine?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: What was the difference --</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: Eight years.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: Eight years?</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: She’s eight years younger?</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: Yes, she was -- yes, she was at that feel -- 14 and I was at the university already.</span> <span id="s488">I was a student.</span> <span id="s489">I think I was from two to five or two to six, I don’t know any more, how long.</span> <span id="s490">I was every day -- every day in the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: Did -- were you -- did you become closer to your -- to your mother after your father died?</span></p> <p><span id="s492">A: We -- I was very, very close to my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: Always?</span> <span id="s494">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s496">More -- closer then -- closer then, yes.</span> <span id="s497">I was working i-in -- helping in the dress making business, too.</span> <span id="s498">I -- I don’t know when I started, actually.</span> <span id="s499">It came very easily to me, only for the second -- for the second shtatsberfong, I went to a course.</span> <span id="s500">And this was three times a week and it is still this ex -- still exists and this was a judge who had this course and he mentioned from nine to 12, or even longer, we were exposed to questions and answers around and when you got up without a break -- without a break.</span> <span id="s501">And when you -- were -- you got up at half past 12 or something, after such a session, you felt as though -- down -- you -- you were really drained.</span> <span id="s502">But he sa -- did it for years and for the -- for the second shtatsberfong.</span> <span id="s503">And -- and you make the shtatsberfong, this is -- the shtatsberfong is made for the service in the administration.</span> <span id="s504">And you make about the same subject a regrozum.</span> <span id="s505">A regrozum is made for the doctorate.</span> <span id="s506">But you have to make two exams, about the same subjects.</span> <span id="s507">There’s always four subjects or five.</span> <span id="s508">And for the -- at the university, for the -- for the -- anyway, I made one exam on the 11th of October and the second exam on the 14th of October, the same subject.</span> <span id="s509">One for the administration service and one for the doctorate.</span> <span id="s510">And as it was, when I came to university and started law, I thought I will meet a lot of Jews, because in Vienna there were all the lawyers.</span> <span id="s511">The most of the lawyers were Jews, but this didn’t happen.</span> <span id="s512">There were the -- the -- there were not in -- not so many Jews on -- at the university because the others -- the not -- the Gentiles who started, they always -- they fill the administration later -- later on.</span> <span id="s513">You didn’t see them, but the Jews had to go into business, in a way and work as -- in a free -- free profession, but the others were feeling a Jew wasn’t -- wasn’t taken into the administration at that time.</span> <span id="s514">And I don’t think there were ever a Jewish judge in Austria.</span> <span id="s515">And they always -- and so this was a discrepancy.</span> <span id="s516">I have only heard of Jewish lawyers, but they’re n-not of the people in the administration who were lawyers.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: When you describe administration, can you explain what that means, because it seems that it’s somewhat different from -- when you say a lawyer and administration, you mean -- do you mean the government?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: Yeah, I mean -- I mean lunder -- yeah, lunder’s help men and -- and bergermeisters and -- and the mayors and all of this, what you feel in the ministry -- in the ministry.</span> <span id="s519">Judges and -- and all what -- what you think in ministry.</span> <span id="s520">But you don -- you meet -- don’t meet these people, usually.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: What had you hoped to become as a lawyer?</span> <span id="s522">What did you want --</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: I didn’t, I -- what I wanted -- actually my aunt, an aunt of mine, who had -- she -- the agency for Buick in Austria -- for the Buick, American cars.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: Cars?</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: She was in industry and she promised me that she will help me to get a job in industry.</span> <span id="s526">But I never thought that I could be a judge.</span> <span id="s527">When is -- it -- it was my -- would have been my wish, but I never regarded that as a --a real possibility in Austria.</span> <span id="s528">No, I never did.</span> <span id="s529">She promised me as a -- when I finished, she will help me to get a -- a -- proposition in any firm.</span> <span id="s530">But I didn’t have a -- a specific hope or anything.</span> <span id="s531">I just studied, with -- and with love -- and I loved it.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: Did you study with Peppy also, even though you were in different classes?</span> <span id="s533">Did you talk --</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: We -- we talked -- as of -- we didn’t study together in that way, but we talked about a lot of law and we talked about everything.</span> <span id="s535">And when we were in company, and he -- a law question came up, everyone turned to him, never to me, to gerdel, he was -- always to him.</span> <span id="s536">But he never would answer without throwing me into the -- into the -- as a -- into the conversation.</span> <span id="s537">He would never talk about -- above me, never.</span> <span id="s538">This made -- this was something very attractive to me too, because you know how it is, gerdels, on the second hand.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: What -- what do you think made him so different?</span> <span id="s540">Why was he so different?</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: He wasn’t different, but people regarded boys -- and he -- at first he was a year -- a year in front of me and -- and it is just society.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: No, no, what I mean is why, wh-what made him different from other men, at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: From other -- why I got to -- I -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s544">This is -- I -- I -- he loved me and I loved him.</span> <span id="s545">This can’t -- can’t be explained in any way.</span> <span id="s546">But we -- we had -- we had everything -- discussed everything together.</span> <span id="s547">I didn’t discuss it with my sister, because my relationship was always a bit strained with her and my mother was busy and was wor -- and he was nearest to me.</span> <span id="s548">And he had a difficult life because of his mother.</span> <span id="s549">I didn’t know that and I accepted it and I helped him in a -- in -- in that way, that I went a lot to him and he went -- we went out.</span> <span id="s550">He had -- at 10 o’clock he had to be at home at an age where it is not e -- not yusherin.</span> <span id="s551">And so it came.</span> <span id="s552">When he made an exam, I was sitting behind him, usually.</span> <span id="s553">Once I was so near to him in an exam, that he was on the chair, he was moving about, that I put my foot on the chair that he couldn’t move.</span> <span id="s554">So near.</span> <span id="s555">At a state exam, I was so near to him.</span> <span id="s556">And we ex -- as a -- discussed law, of course.</span> <span id="s557">And bought books and everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: Did he have a good sense of humor?</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: I think so -- do -- I tho -- I think so, too, yes, I think so.</span> <span id="s560">As a -- good laugh, it -- it -- it was very, as a -- it was very near to him.</span> <span id="s561">Because I wasn’t so near to my sister, and the other one.</span> <span id="s562">And when -- I know my youngest sister, she learned French at school and my -- and she used -- she was very spoiled and she wanted -- my father wanted me to do her homework with her, but I didn’t want, of course.</span> <span id="s563">And he learned French so that he could ho -- could take my place.</span> <span id="s564">But he learned at school Greek and Latin.</span> <span id="s565">He couldn’t -- he didn’t -- and he started to learn French.</span> <span id="s566">I-It was the beginning of French, so that he could take my place.</span> <span id="s567">When we -- we --</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: Let’s talk a little bit about emigration.</span> <span id="s571">Did you -- did you -- all of you in your family and Peppy, begin to talk about leaving Austria?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: No, I -- Peppy didn’t dare to talk about leaving Austria because his mother said, when she -- at first -- he was brought up as a Jew and he left the Jewish religion only after Hitler came.</span> <span id="s573">So he -- after the Nuremberger laws, he was regarded as a Jew, not as a half-Jew.</span> <span id="s574">Even his mother was still a Jew.</span> <span id="s575">His mother became Jewish to get married, but not with her brain or with her feeling, just to get married.</span> <span id="s576">To -- he -- to the rich Jew, to the Jewish -- and she also left then the Jewish religion, but she was not a -- so that she doesn’t be regarded as a Jew.</span> <span id="s577">But he was regarded as a -- as a Jew and he w -- he was obliged to wear the star.</span> <span id="s578">He didn’t do it, but he va -- he was obliged to do it.</span> <span id="s579">And of course we -- when we talked -- when he talked at home, I mentioned immigration, then his mother said she’s jumping out of the window, she commit suicide.</span> <span id="s580">He was her only son and his mother h-had strong will and his father had died years ago.</span> <span id="s581">I didn’t ha -- I didn’t know his father.</span> <span id="s582">His father was -- ha -- I don’t know even the illness.</span> <span id="s583">It was a mental illness, it was something -- he died in a mental asylum.</span> <span id="s584">And he was in for long time.</span> <span id="s585">They went once a week, the mother and the son, to visit him in that -- it must have been as he was a teenager, it must pas -- have been a harrowing time.</span> <span id="s586">Yoyosee.</span> <span id="s587">And I think this time was when the power of the mother was established, about the son -- that he was the only son.</span> <span id="s588">She -- the family of his father paid her a pension, she didn’t work.</span> <span id="s589">And they gave -- and so everybody of the family -- I didn’t know all the family, gave something and she got it like a pension, without -- bit -- betting -- without saying -- paying, or -- or s -- even -- she didn’t have to say thank you.</span> <span id="s590">But she didn’t work to bring up the son.</span> <span id="s591">And -- seez -- and s-she got then married again and she kept her marriage secret from the family, so that she gets a pension [indecipherable] that’s her pay.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: Why don’t we take a break so we can change the tape?</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: Because you have -- End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s597">Edith, when we ended the last tape, you were talking about Peppy and emigration.</span> <span id="s598">I wanted to s-start, before getting to the Anschluss, with whether the -- you and your mother and your sisters were also talking about emigration?</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s600">We were all -- actually, my sister, my -- Mimi, who was near me, she -- sh -- our -- our concierge where we lived in that house, as th -- she took off our -- we had a plate that my mother’s a dressmaker.</span> <span id="s601">They took it off and they were worried.</span> <span id="s602">They thought all -- we are exempted because my father was an invalid and a soldier in the first World War and the Jews were -- they were against it, the Nazi, they were all somewhere, so this was an abstract -- abstract notion, somewhere on top, but not for us, it was and she recommended -- she didn’t know the people there and she put m-my sister in contact with a Jewish comasherot, it was called, as a -- in -- in [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s603">He -- and he told her about baitar -- about this illegal transport.</span> <span id="s604">And my sister went and with -- with her -- she got married before she left on -- in December and on the fourth of -- of February, she went with her husband on an illegal transport.</span> <span id="s605">And she was -- sh -- this transport was a very unhappy one.</span> <span id="s606">It -- sh-she got Scarlet fever in Romania and she was in hospital there and when -- they had a -- a fire on the ship and they were saved by Italian war ships and brought to Roldus and in Roldus they had to wait until fum -- some money comes from America and a new ship.</span> <span id="s607">And she was on her way, I think until end of August.</span> <span id="s608">From February until the end of August.</span> <span id="s609">But in the end, the ship a-arrived in Natania.</span> <span id="s610">And the youngest sister had joined a -- a Jewish youth camp, Shamere Hadsa’eer.</span> <span id="s611">And she got a visa certificate as a member of Shamere Hadsa’eer and she went on the day when the Kristallnacht -- on the Kristallnacht -- on the tenth of -- of November, at that time, she went normally over Trieste, to Israel with normal fare, they -- as a -- the illegal transport were all very expensive, because the Gestapo had to get their share of it and she went normally and she had a certificate from zavitzoh to a school, she was 17.</span> <span id="s612">And she has -- must have written -- made a tour of Israel as it was and our letters -- our correspondence was veero to Belgrade, where my mother’s sisters was married.</span> <span id="s613">And my mother’s sister ben -- put the letters in a different envelope and send it to Israel, because at that time, was war.</span> <span id="s614">And so we got our letters back.</span> <span id="s615">And this -- my sister’s letters stopped completely.</span> <span id="s616">And she must have written something about the country, what the censor didn’t approve of it.</span> <span id="s617">That was -- she was -- she must have had maybe a trip or something and she couldn’t write any more.</span> <span id="s618">And my mother didn’t get any letters any more from her, she was crying sometimes, the child does -- isn’t alive any more, because she didn’t [indecipherable] she’s all right, but she didn’t believe it, because she didn’t write -- my youngest sister -- no letter of my s -- youngest sister came through.</span> <span id="s619">This must be the British censor in -- in Palestine must have -- and after many months, then we got a letter and she had the idea to write she had an accident, she writes with the left hand.</span> <span id="s620">So this was not recognized as the same handwriting.</span> <span id="s621">But this -- my mother was crying sometimes and said the child isn’t alive any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: Did you continually hear from Mimi, the other sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: Yes, we did, but she -- but the youngest -- and she wrote she’s all right, but the -- but none letter from -- this must be the -- the mit -- milit -- military censorship.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: So how come you and your mother stayed in Vienna and the other two sisters left?</span> <span id="s625">Was it -- w-was the --</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: Well, we couldn’t -- a-at first it was one after the other and my mother had to settle something, to pay for my sister’s fare.</span> <span id="s627">We had lazaklub cecils and with a Persian carpet, when everybody was at that time, buying Jewish things and -- and so it -- it hadn’t slo -- we didn’t go so quickly, it was all a matter of time.</span> <span id="s628">And I was not thinking -- actually, strai -- other -- a peeper -- not me, myself, other people had made -- found somebody who would apply in England for me, as -- but it didn’t come to -- it didn’t -- I wasn’t very interested.</span> <span id="s629">I didn’t force it with -- with power or with -- with energy, to go abroad, because I thought it will -- as a -- I always hoped it will be over soon and I wanted to stay with Peppy and to see it through with him.</span> <span id="s630">And my mother was working as a dressmaker and we had on the -- on -- when the Kristallnacht was, two days ago, a colleague of mine came to us and ask if he can sleep that night and when the Kristallnacht is with us, because he -- we were only women and in a district which was not a diplomatic district.</span> <span id="s631">The neighbor of us was the Polnish embassy and -- in that day.</span> <span id="s632">And h-his brother was told by an friend, who was in the SR that the Kristallnacht is coming.</span> <span id="s633">He did know already and he was told that he and his brother should not be at home.</span> <span id="s634">Because at that time, they took only men in the Kristallnacht, not women.</span> <span id="s635">My mother said of course, yes, he can sleep with us when he is in danger and he did.</span> <span id="s636">And so he -- they came to collect him and his brother -- his brother slept somewhere, too.</span> <span id="s637">They -- an-and only the old parents were at home and the two young man were saved from Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s638">But he did know it before, an SS man had told him.</span> <span id="s639">This was a spontaneous kuntgabel [indecipherable] from the Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: Can you go back a little bit and describe what you remember about the Anschluss and about the resignation of Shussnik?</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: There we were on -- he -- he -- I was in the course.</span> <span id="s642">I made a course for the third -- start the exam in Rigarosen.</span> <span id="s643">And we -- this was in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s644">He -- in the late afternoon he collected me, we were walking down the Ringstrasse and there were nasties -- Nazis making noise -- na -- was not very comfortable, we feel -- didn’t feel comfortable and we went into the tenth -- tenth district, this is the working class district and there somebody shouted from a window, “Shussnik has resigned,” you know?</span> <span id="s645">And in the street -- and so he took me and at that time in his arm and we -- we gi -- as a -- promised each other to look -- to come through this thing by our -- together.</span> <span id="s646">And then he was -- Shussnik ased it was a Friday.</span> <span id="s647">And on Saturday, there was plant a folksabstemung as a -- a referendum -- a referendum.</span> <span id="s648">If Austria should be a part of Germany or not.</span> <span id="s649">If Hitler should -- but si -- Hitler did know that he would not win, because at that time, they thought -- they thought the itemocart ashiparti went together with the -- with the fartalandishin front and he wouldn’t know they wouldn’t -- he wou -- he did know.</span> <span id="s650">So he -- h -- this is why he -- he -- he invaded Austria and he -- on Sunday, there was no referendum, but he invaded Austria, he -- and this referendum was later on, with 99 percent is it usually -- no, it’s not setime.</span> <span id="s651">Or with 98 or 99, as though this was then and so it came.</span> <span id="s652">But he would not have won at that time, Hitler, because a sociale democratishipati and sifartalishifund jerhovan wel -- were together against him.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: D-Do you remember the -- the march into Austria -- Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: No.</span> <span id="s655">I wa -- at that time, thank God, there was no television, we couldn’t see the muss and we couldn’t see that.</span> <span id="s656">We were at home and we’re unhappy.</span> <span id="s657">You can’t imagine.</span> <span id="s658">Actually, on that Sunday, my grandparents had to go an wedding in Shtockerau.</span> <span id="s659">This was a day of -- they’re going -- we didn’t go.</span> <span id="s660">We were afraid we may not be able to come home again or something.</span> <span id="s661">And so the Golden wedding fell down because we were afraid, we stayed at home.</span> <span id="s662">And thank God there was no -- we didn’t -- we didn’t -- no television, so we didn’t see all.</span> <span id="s663">Now I see it on television, but not at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: What did you expect?</span> <span id="s665">What did you -- you were afraid, what were you afraid of at that point, do you think?</span> <span id="s666">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: Afraid?</span> <span id="s668">N-No -- what?</span> <span id="s669">That the Nazi get the power.</span> <span id="s670">Not beesh -- not -- nothing special, aso nots -- nothing special, but that -- very soon, after they got power, there was -- the first order came, that all Jews had to bring to the police, their radio and typewriters.</span> <span id="s671">This was not allowed to the Jews, they had to be brought to the -- not for money, just to -- to brought to the police.</span> <span id="s672">They -- and so we didn’t have a typewriter, only a radio and not a very good one, ifa so we didn’t lose at that time, very much.</span> <span id="s673">And so it came one after the other.</span> <span id="s674">Then all this -- the children were at once thrown out of school.</span> <span id="s675">They couldn’t go to school as a ve -- any more and at the university, I were -- we -- I had applied for a termin for my se -- state exam in April, but instead of a termin, I got my papers back.</span> <span id="s676">I got -- and there was no state -- I was completely prepared to make -- I was ex-expected to prom -- to have the promotion to be a doctor in the summer, because this was the last state exam in Rigarosen in -- in economy and -- and state [indecipherable] that we had to learn the Constitution of America, the Constitution of Britain and all of this we had to learn.</span> <span id="s677">And the Constitution of Austria and Germany, all this for that exam.</span> <span id="s678">And economy we had to learn.</span> <span id="s679">We had to learn the different failries of economy and all that.</span> <span id="s680">And I was pre -- completely prepared to -- for that.</span> <span id="s681">But I didn’t get to termin any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: So, was -- Peppy got his degree the year before --</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: He had it a year before, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q: So all the Jews could not take that exam?</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A: No, no, no, th-this was the end.</span> <span id="s686">Some of my colleagues did it later on.</span> <span id="s687">One of my colleague -- his name is Auchilled, I -- he wrote me a short while ago, as o -- he didn’t feel -- he could go to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s688">I suppose with such a name, you could go.</span> <span id="s689">And he was -- he didn’t -- he went back to Austria and he became dean -- what you call dean dakan, of the university in Lintz.</span> <span id="s690">He is ri -- living now in o -- in Vienna.</span> <span id="s691">He’s retired now and he’s living in Vienna.</span> <span id="s692">He wrote -- I had a letter from him a short while ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: So then what happened?</span> <span id="s694">Very shortly you have to register, all the Jews have to register.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: This was not shortly, it’s slowly -- it slowly came.</span> <span id="s696">This was ‘41, then.</span> <span id="s697">This was 30 --</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: So what happens --</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: We are -- were living -- we were living -- we were working, we were sewing.</span> <span id="s700">We had always work and my mother was a very gifted dressmaker and we had -- and we worked, as a -- lived quietly.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: But did you -- you have to move out of your apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: Yeah, this -- we had to move out.</span> <span id="s703">They wrote us, said they have to give us notice, because this house where we lived was, before -- and -- was a archbish -- a -- a palace, from an a-archbishop Solvato.</span> <span id="s704">And all this counted -- we got notice, ha -- Hapsburg [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s705">And we -- w -- see were then sent to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s706">But we lived in -- we got a room in the -- in the flat of my f -- brother-in-law’s aunt.</span> <span id="s707">His aunt and sh -- and so we -- in the ghetto, she had a -- her ow -- flat in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s708">There were two rooms and a -- what they call in Vienna, cabinet -- a small room.</span> <span id="s709">And in the first room the old lady lived, in the second room two sisters, one of them was married, lived.</span> <span id="s710">And in the third room, we lived.</span> <span id="s711">And we were still sewing there and was very, very -- and so had only sewing machine in the bats and something.</span> <span id="s712">And we had to walk through the first -- the kitchen was in front, in front of the rooms.</span> <span id="s713">But we were all sensible people, we didn’t quarrel.</span> <span id="s714">And there were no quarrels and stev -- no recklessness or anything.</span> <span id="s715">We -- we didn’t know each other before, but still it was all a very, very sensible living together.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: The name of the woman whose apartment it was, it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: Yes, it was Miman.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Q: Miman.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A: Mrs. Miman -- from the old lady.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: Was that difficult, to make the move?</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: Oh yeah, wi -- was -- it wasn’t easy, but y -- we had to do it and we did it.</span> <span id="s722">And -- ind -- before that, my -- how -- that you have an idea, in Shtockerau, my -- my grandfather, who was at that time a widower, his moth -- his wife had died, he was a diabetic, had a stroke and was an ill man.</span> <span id="s723">And he had to live his -- to go out of his house, not to take anything, that the Nazis came -- came -- can go in.</span> <span id="s724">He was, for 45 years, living in that house, had brought up his family there and he didn’t understand how the -- what happens.</span> <span id="s725">He really didn’t understand.</span> <span id="s726">He was sent to live with a distant cousin in a -- in a -- in one room.</span> <span id="s727">My mother send me to live there, too, because you had to bring him to the toilet, he couldn’t walk alone to the toilet.</span> <span

youngest sister, Johanna, as it is in Ashkenazi family, was already called after my grandmother, because she had died a short time ago, before.</span> <span id="s741">You know that is a -- so she was called Johanna, after the grandmother.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: Now, what is happening in terms of your s -- your social circle?</span> <span id="s743">Is it becoming [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A: Oh, the sa -- we -- the social circle [inaudible].</span> <span id="s745">My -- my mother could always go to one of her -- when she was a widow, to one of her sisters-in-law or something, she was not lonely in that way.</span> <span id="s746">And in the end she had us.</span> <span id="s747">She had a -- loved to do and was sewing and people -- some came and some lep -- some didn’t come, visit is always.</span> <span id="s748">Our best friend, my sister’s best friend, she was -- we were together on holidays.</span> <span id="s749">She was a student of medicine atall.</span> <span id="s750">They didn’t come.</span> <span id="s751">I went once and ask if I can sleep a night in their ha -- in their flat, when I didn’t have anywhere -- they said no, they hadn’t room for me and they became such Nazis, that they were -- after the war, forbidden to -- to be doctors in Vienna.</span> <span id="s752">The -- she and her -- her -- her boyfriend, at that time, later her husband, they were medici -- studied medicine and I suppose she became a doctor without the end exams and I suppose sh -- we were already afraid of the Jewish doctors -- of the conquerins.</span> <span id="s753">She became such Nazis that -- that they were not allowed to be -- practice in Vienna.</span> <span id="s754">Actually, her nephew was still studying medicine as well, after the war and came to Tel Aviv.</span> <span id="s755">Because when you work a term in Tel Aviv, in the Jewish hospital, it is counted in Vienna, as term.</span> <span id="s756">Not in any -- when you go to Spain, it isn’t counted, but tella -- as a -- a Jewish hospital is counted.</span> <span id="s757">When he was working a term, three months or something, in -- in a hospital in Tel Aviv as a student, he came to visit me.</span> <span id="s758">They sent him to me.</span> <span id="s759">He came to visit me.</span> <span id="s760">And so she’s now dead, she died of a har -- heart attack and -- and -- this friend, but so -- so the circle changed.</span> <span id="s761">You had suddenly -- your best friend was suddenly a Nazi.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: Was this surprising -- was this surprising to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: No, it wasn’t -- it was accepted by us.</span> <span id="s764">It was accep --</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Q: Did it anger you?</span></p> <p><span id="s766">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Q: Did it anger you?</span></p> <p><span id="s768">A: Anger you, ve -- of course we -- we didn’t feel a -- we -- we did feel, but this wa -- we were up to the la -- before my -- my sister left for Israel, the evening before -- they were coming to us to say -- to -- to -- we -- to -- with a present -- with a present for the traveling, for -- I think it was a trainings accen -- anzug at that time.</span> <span id="s769">And because this was -- si -- si -- I think it comes out in the book by Goldhagen.</span> <span id="s770">This different of the Jews -- of the Jewish neighbor and the Jewish amid -- aso -- a-administration on top somewhere, who was -- wants to reign the world.</span> <span id="s771">I think it come -- I have the feeling, when I read Goldhagen’s book, I had the feeling that he understood that.</span> <span id="s772">And this was what happened, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: So that -- you’re saying that people became afraid of this abstract emotion --</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: Yeah, pe-people were --</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: -- of the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: Yes, they were -- and -- and -- they said also Germany was on top of everything.</span> <span id="s777">There was the -- the expression, “Un deutshen raison vil develt kanasan.”</span> <span id="s778">Do you understand it?</span> <span id="s779">“Un deutshen raison.”</span> <span id="s780">this is the -- on the German way of -- of living maybe, “Vil,” the wer, “Vil,” will the world be healthy, or something.</span> <span id="s781">And the expression is, un -- un -- “Un deutshen raison vil develt kanasan.”</span> <span id="s782">That’s what this was.</span> <span id="s783">And -- and -- you ha-have to understand, the Nazis gave every German a possibly to feel about others, on top of others.</span> <span id="s784">And everybody was suddenly something special, because every other --even of -- if it was a Pole or Czech or anything, was underneath.</span> <span id="s785">And so, I had one of m-my schoolmates in the primary school was working in a factory where they made underwear.</span> <span id="s786">And we both fa -- she came to us in the set -- set -- she gets it cheaper and sold it to us, and we had wonderful underwear cheap -- at the cheaper price.</span> <span id="s787">But, it was stolen -- but we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s788">And she was sentenced to prison for that.</span> <span id="s789">She didn’t give us a name -- our name and so we were not connected with it, but she was, in the end found out and -- and sent to prison.</span> <span id="s790">And her mother, when the Nazi came, suddenly came to me -- to me personally on the street and express her pity for me.</span> <span id="s791">And so this, I fa -- it was horrible, can you imagine?</span> <span id="s792">This -- her daughter was sent to prison because of theft and -- and sh-she fel -- suddenly were on top somewhere and expressed her pity to me.</span> <span id="s793">This was -- this -- I do remember that.</span> <span id="s794">This was a horrible experience.</span> <span id="s795">And so everybody was now some -- a step higher in the society and we were the lowest.</span> <span id="s796">And this was -- was something -- what the Germans -- the -- the -- they really felt above everybody.</span> <span id="s797">Not only about -- a-above the Jews, above everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Q: Can you describe some of the restrictions that you had once the Nazis took over?</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: All the na -- we -- there were restrictions, the Jews were not allowed in certain streets.</span> <span id="s800">But we -- we didn’t take notice of it.</span> <span id="s801">Actually, I was jaywalking once, as it is -- with all this hat full and a policeman -- i-in Vienna when you ha -- were jaywalking, you had to pay five shillings as punishment.</span> <span id="s802">A policeman came to me and ask five shillings.</span> <span id="s803">I said, “I haven’t got any money, I’m a Jew.</span> <span id="s804">I haven’t got any money.”</span> <span id="s805">And then he didn’t ask a money any more.</span> <span id="s806">I didn’t have to pay.</span> <span id="s807">I have not paid this fi -- but I say to, “I have no money, I am a Jew.”</span> <span id="s808">To the policeman.</span> <span id="s809">This was a Nazi time.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: Do you think that was -- that wasn’t typical, that someone wouldn’t [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: I don’t know, I -- but it happened to me.</span> <span id="s812">It happened to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: Were there times, restricted times to buy food, or only certain places where you could buy food?</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A: Not at that time, later on.</span> <span id="s815">Not at that time, not in the beginning.</span> <span id="s816">I can’t remember when it started, I can’t -- I couldn’t say that.</span> <span id="s817">Later on the Jews had different -- we got the ration books before the war started, already.</span> <span id="s818">Everybody ha -- was a week or something -- before the war started, the ration books were already distributed.</span> <span id="s819">And it -- it later ca -- and -- is it, is -- I had a pupil, I always -- I told you I always gave lessons.</span> <span id="s820">She was a nurse and she wanted to study medicine and this -- she had to learn Latin.</span> <span id="s821">She was about this -- older than I was, about 30’s.</span> <span id="s822">And -- and I ta-taught her Latin for that and she was in Social Security somewhere involved and the Nazis gave at once everybody who was in Social Security got a food parcel, everybody.</span> <span id="s823">And she wa -- had to tell who -- to whom she got the food parcel and she got the food parcel to a Jewish family, because she said they didn’t have anything.</span> <span id="s824">So she was -- had one sect -- she lost her job [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s825">She said it was -- she -- she did it because they didn’t have anything, they were in need, but it was not meant for Jews.</span> <span id="s826">And so this was the end of her career.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Q: Were you hungry?</span></p> <p><span id="s828">A: Wasn’t -- can’t say that we were hungry.</span> <span id="s829">Actually, my uncle in -- in Belgrade, he was working for the donut armshifartska sayshaft, and he send us food.</span> <span id="s830">They -- with a capit -- with the skippers.</span> <span id="s831">When the ship came to --to Vienna from Belgrade, the skippers came to us and brought us food.</span> <span id="s832">He send us, this uncle.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Q: So that must have helped.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A: This helped, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">Q: Did things start getting worse after the war started in ‘39?</span></p> <p><span id="s836">A: I was very disappointed that ween wasn’t bombed.</span> <span id="s837">Actually, yeah, I was enjoying.</span> <span id="s838">When I -- I -- I was rejoicing when the war started.</span> <span id="s839">I hope this is the end.</span> <span id="s840">And I was very disappo -- I hope that the allieta will come and -- and bomb Vienna at once, and they didn’t and I was very disappointed that -- that not in -- in six weeks, Germany was bombed and -- and was -- that it wasn’t an end.</span> <span id="s841">This is -- I was not sorry that -- when the war started.</span> <span id="s842">I was very, very gay at -- I was never -- didn’t believe a minute that Hitler will mo -- will win the war.</span> <span id="s843">I didn’t win -- I didn’t think that.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Q: But you underestimated his --</span></p> <p><span id="s845">A: Yeah, well --</span></p> <p><span id="s846">Q: -- possibilities.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">A: Of course -- of course.</span> <span id="s848">I hoped always it will be end.</span> <span id="s849">When -- when -- when Paris fell, Peppy and I was in an -- at a lecture in the weena orania.</span> <span id="s850">And somebody came out and said Paris fell.</span> <span id="s851">And so he took me, he was af -- on -- on the -- on the -- in the middle of the lecture, h-he -- he put his arm around me, I was af -- he was afraid I would do something or have things and when Mussolini entered, we were walking -- we were walking around the donikanai, but when I heard that Mussolini entered, I got sick.</span> <span id="s852">I got -- I got -- I had to go home.</span> <span id="s853">I got doof -- how do you say?</span> <span id="s854">I wa -- I was completely sick.</span> <span id="s855">Ca -- bodily sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s858">When I heard that Musso-Mussolini entered the war, I -- I had to go home, I was sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: What -- what do you think happened to you?</span> <span id="s860">You thought that there was --</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A: I -- I -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s862">My body didn’t -- didn’t do any -- as a -- I -- I h -- I had -- I -- I was co -- co -- really sick.</span> <span id="s863">I had to go home, put to bed, was really sick.</span> <span id="s864">Because this was such a shock, that Mussolini entered the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">Q: Now, at this time, Peppy is hiding that he’s Jewish, you’re not hiding that you’re Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s866">A: No.</span> <span id="s867">I -- I -- man -- I had nobody to hide it far --except you re -- you didn’t wear a star and I moved about in Vienna like -- like normally.</span> <span id="s868">Actually, I never had the feeling I have enemies or anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: You didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: Na -- even later on, no.</span> <span id="s871">I never had the feeling.</span> <span id="s872">I was a very happy Viennese girl.</span> <span id="s873">I only wanted that this people, the Nazis are -- are away.</span> <span id="s874">And -- and even -- hadn’t -- wasn’t afraid of any special one and never had the feeling I have somebody who would be my enemy or would do me something personally.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">Q: Do you think that you were quite different from other -- from other Jews?</span> <span id="s876">I mean you were living in the ghetto, did you notice a different kind of feeling from other people that were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: N-No, no.</span> <span id="s878">We -- as o -- we -- we were -- I was never one who had much to say and my society was Peppy and we played a lot of chess together, we talked about it and -- and went for long walks in the parta at that time and -- and on stonacanals or in -- we -- and in -- I was sewing with my mother and so it was.</span> <span id="s879">We were working -- I came -- he came every evening and this was a very, very long walk from the tents [indecipherable] to -- to the second -- to the place where we were living.</span> <span id="s880">He was -- had a walk of at least an hour, every day.</span> <span id="s881">One way.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">Q: So Edith, did you never see mistreatment of Jews on the streets, that would --</span></p> <p><span id="s883">A: I have seen -- when they had to wash this -- I -- I was prepared to be -- to have to go too, but I wasn’t taken.</span> <span id="s884">I -- but my youngest sister, she was picked up on the street once, as a Jew.</span> <span id="s885">And -- and she was taken -- she was 17 -- she was taken to a place, she had to sew on buttons on uniforms.</span> <span id="s886">And in that place, she saw in that next room, pe -- Jews with beards, be forced to make kneebo -- athletic exercises -- exercises.</span> <span id="s887">She saw that.</span> <span id="s888">And she was so disturbed that she didn’t go home at once.</span> <span id="s889">She walks o the steer -- streets and when she came home, she was completely disturbed.</span> <span id="s890">My Hansie, my youngest sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">Q: So how -- knowing that that happened, or even seeing some of it, how do you account for your own not feeling as if you had any enemies?</span></p> <p><span id="s892">A: Not personally.</span> <span id="s893">I had never the feeling this is per -- as a -- I saw Nazis, but -- but -- but I never had the feeling that I have a personal -- that somebody would come and -- and want vengeance on me or anything, no, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Q: But you certainly experienced the Nazis as your enemies, but not --</span></p> <p><span id="s895">A: Yeah, yes, of course.</span> <span id="s896">Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Q: In some abstract way, but not --</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s899">Somebody you avoided.</span> <span id="s900">And it was forbidden to go to pictures, it was forbidden to go in -- in some streets.</span> <span id="s901">It was -- everything was forbidden, but when you ha -- when everything is forbidden, you have to live with it.</span> <span id="s902">You -- you -- or ignore it.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">Q: So you didn’t get depressed?</span></p> <p><span id="s904">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q: You got [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s906">A: I was nervous sometimes, I was nervous.</span> <span id="s907">I know Peppy borrowed -- borrowed me then, sanitogen or something from -- to -- to quiet my nerves.</span> <span id="s908">But occasionally, this is.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">Q: Do you remember the day you got the notice about having to register as a Jew?</span> <span id="s910">In April --</span></p> <p><span id="s911">A: This was ‘41.</span> <span id="s912">In May for -- April -- in -- e-end of April, ‘41.</span> <span id="s913">Ev-Every Jew had to be registered

<p><span id="s1005">A: No.</span> <span id="s1006">I ver -- I can’t say that.</span> <span id="s1007">This is -- actually I wrote to my mother that I have lost the menstruation and she went to a colleague of ours.</span> <span id="s1008">They were -- he was at that time doctor in Roch hospital in Vane.</span> <span id="s1009">And he said, “She will be -- I suppose she’s got pregnant.”</span>

from Vienna were not used to that and we complained.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">Q: And what was the result of the complaint?</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">A: No, it was no result at all.</span> <span id="s1022">No result at all.</span> <span id="s1023">We all wer -- ask for a par -- par -- for parcels from Vienna.</span> <span id="s1024">We all --</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">Q: And so you were allowed to get parcels?</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1027">And later on, when we worked there, I sent parcels too, to Vienna.</span> <span id="s1028">I sent a lot of food to Vienna and -- it -- something was suppo -- was forbidden to send.</span> <span id="s1029">Maybe pota -- I think potatoes or something.</span> <span id="s1030">But in the Post Office, they

-- you hadn’t -- I never had the feeling -- there were some who would not want to have anything to do with Jews, but I didn’t love a-all people and if they don’t love me, I don’t care.</span> <span

had.</span> <span id="s1066">For the people we were -- as it is in my letters -- a different society they had as workers.</span> <span id="s1067">They wondered that we are saying bitte -- bitte and danke, so -- please and thank you, what they were not used to and we didn’t steal from each other and all of these things.</span> <span id="s1068">It was a revolution -- it was something new to that people -- what they ever expected from farm workers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Q: And there was a Jewish population at Osterberg that you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">A: No, no.</span></p>

<span id="s1077">I did it.</span> <span id="s1078">I just --</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">Q: And did you do it openly, or did you hide?</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">A: I think -- I suppose I hi -- I didn’t put it o-openly.</span> <span id="s1081">I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1082">And so I ta -- I can’t remember that any more.</span> <span id="s1083">But for me it was not to make a -- ev -- to send it to Peppy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">Q: So he should see where you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">A: He should see where -- how it is, yes.</span> <span id="s1086">It was not the feeling to make a historical note, but I wanted to send him to -- send it to Peppy.</span> <span id="s1087">And I described very -- very solonly our work and what we have to do, because I wanted him to know.</span> <span id="s1088">I wrote him before, that to him I will always only the truth, but not to mother, I said to him.</span> <span id="s1089">To mother, I don’t know if I said it before, I will al -- I said to him it is the truth, but to mother, I may not tell everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">Q: Was he telling you the truth about what was happening in Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">A: Yeah, wa -- he was -- as a -- leaving very, very restricted.</span> <span id="s1092">He -- for him it was the danger that he will -- there were ratsius, as a -- the people were looking for deserters and h-he -- he was excluded from the army, as a Jew.</span> <span id="s1093">He had this paper.</span> <span id="s1094">But this t-told that he’s a Jew and this he couldn’t ha -- he couldn’t have and he pretended to be working.</span> <span id="s1095">So he went out only in the morning and came back as he -- he were coming back from work.</span> <span id="s1096">And he was very -- as o -- he was very conscious that he -- about these things, that people shouldn’t think he’s running about without being in the army.</span> <span id="s1097">And -- and he was living with his mother, his father was long dead.</span> <span id="s1098">He was forgi -- for -- he was for -- for-forgotten.</span> <span id="s1099">And he hadn’t any ration books, because he was a Jew and his mother kept him without ration books.</span> <span id="s1100">And, as it happens, these peop -- the woman who had to deal with the ration books, didn’t care.</span> <span id="s1101">If she had cared, it would be dangerous.</span> <span id="s1102">You always depended on people who didn’t -- who were not too thoroughly in their jobs, as she -- she -- she distributed sic -- the ration books -- she -- the ration cards she got, but she didn’t care if he has any or not.</span> <span id="s1103">He was living in the same house, but she didn’t -- she was not possi -- aga -- doing something about it, but he never had any ration cards.</span> <span id="s1104">His mother kept them.</span> <span id="s1105">His mother went swoll -- swore -- s-swore din -- a -- an -- an oath, said she smokes.</span> <span id="s1106">He was a heavy smoker and she -- only smokers got -- women only got -- got cigarettes who were -- who swore an -- an oath that they are smokers, because they wouldn’t get other -- and she did it to get cigarettes for him.</span> <span id="s1107">Yeah, she -- she went and swore that she is a smoker.</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">Q: Did men have to swear also, or wo --</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">A: No, I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">Q: So it’s only women.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">A: But women.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">Q: Can you describe the -- some of the other prisoners and did you become friends with other women at Osterberg quickly or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">A: I think it -- in -- in my letters, it comes out that this was -- we -- it was a normal relationship.</span> <span id="s1114">Some were better, some easier and -- but there were no prob -- no special problems.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">Q: No.</span> <span id="s1116">You -- what -- in one letter, you wrote -- this was the -- within, I guess it was at the end of May, after you’d been there a few weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">Q: You said, “You’ve never seen such a clean town as ours.</span> <span id="s1119">It may be clean, but it has no feelings.”</span> <span id="s1120">What are you -- what did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">A: Osterberg -- it was a special north German town without any -- any special expression or -- it was very clean.</span> <span id="s1122">It impressed me, north Germany, that it is very clean.</span> <span id="s1123">Cleaner than Vienna is, of course.</span> <span id="s1124">And so I was -- this was -- I wrote about it, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">Q: Did you mean that it had no feelings or it had no character, it wasn’t interesting?</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">A: It was not interesting and not -- I was used to different -- to different religious.</span> <span id="s1127">I haven’t been out of Austria before and this was, for me, somewhere strange.</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">Q: Now, du-during this period, were you having some difficulties in your letters with Peppy, in terms of what he would -- whether he would really marry you or he wouldn’t?</span> <span id="s1129">Because at one point, you say you prayed --</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">A: No, it was so -- that people in the -- in the camp could go home when they got mor -- when they were married.</span> <span id="s1131">This was the reason.</span> <span id="s1132">And -- as o -- I found it is a marriage between us, I experienced it in pure formality.</span> <span id="s1133">And when it can help me, we’ll do it.</span> <span id="s1134">If I could go to Vienna, maybe we could go to -- to Consibordo or something, it -- it would be a new -- a new possibility.</span> <span id="s1135">But he -- he didn’t react.</span> <span id="s1136">He -- he didn’t want to do it.</span> <span id="s1137">When he was sitting with his mother, and this hurt me very much, I must say, because I regarded it as a formality, not as -- as a sacrifice.</span> <span id="s1138">And this hurt me and -- this behavior, in that way, I -- was -- it wa -- made me dissad.</span> <span id="s1139">I would not have married him any more, after I came back.</span> <span id="s1140">If w -- if I had not met -- met Peppy, I would not have.</span> <span id="s1141">When I met Werner -- when I met Werner, when I wrote him about him, then he wrote to me, as oh, I shouldn’t do it and what would your mother say, and all these things what he didn’t do before.</span> <span id="s1142">H-He didn’t worry what my mother said when -- if he’s not marrying me and I would not have married him.</span> <span id="s1143">This was my vengeance, in a way.</span> <span id="s1144">I was good with him, but I would not have married him in any case.</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">Q: There is a letter that you write in August from Osterberg.</span> <span id="s1146">Actually, there are two.</span> <span id="s1147">One that you want to get Aryan identity and the other that you wanted to, in some way, withdraw from Judaism and Peppy, apparently, according to you, writes back and says, “Don’t do that.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">A: No, Aryan -- A-Aryan identity, I didn’t want, but somewhere, because I -- I don’t know -- I was in -- in -- at sometimes, I suppose very depressed and so I wrote in that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">Q: Were you thinking also in some way that maybe you could pass?</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">Q: No, you weren’t -- you were just -- [indecipherable] to get [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">A: Yeah, I wa -- I was depressed and maybe I just had time, I didn’t want to have anything to do with it any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">Q: And this is also after Peppy does not say --</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">A: Yes, yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">Q: So it may be part of the same?</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">Q: You also said in a letter, that you thought you should die young, that it would have been better to die young.</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">A: Mayess --</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">Q: Was that in a state of depression about your relationship?</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">A: Yes, it was, yes.</span> <span id="s1161">Of course, you -- certainly I was very depressed [inaudible].</span> <span id="s1162">I-In that state and -- and the hopelessness, that -- that you cannot go away and all these things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">Q: So that must have been one of the worst times for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">A: One of the worst, yes, of the [indecipherable] depressions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">Q: Did he understand that?</span> <span id="s1166">Did he understand what had hap -- what would --</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">A: He was only -- he always kept a distance to me.</span> <span id="s1168">He was in his place and he kept a distance.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">Q: I think we should take a break now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">Q: Edith, be-before we move on to the next camp that you went to, I -- A-Asherslabin, I wanted to ask you about money and Austrians and the Jews and your views about what it was that the Austrians were really interested in when the Nazis took over.</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">A: I was inter -- they were interested in money, very much in money and they -- every -- in -- in Austria there were 200,000 Jews.</span> <span id="s1174">Now is -- is 7,000.</span> <span id="s1175">And 200,000 Jews had businesses and had -- e-even Crystal

id="s1179">He said unkit things will pay [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1180">He made the joke.</span> <span id="s1181">And -- and they were -- everybody was better off in that way and many people could buy some things.</span> <span id="s1182">People had -- we have to have -- have sold Persian carpet, we have sold things, because we -- we did need some money.</span> <span id="s1183">And there were no place where wi -- to keep it.</span> <span id="s1184">My mother put her fur -- she had a fur coat, a Persian fur coat and was the coat -- at that time, the Jewish uniform in Vienna.</span> <span id="s1185">And she put it to a pawn broker, because she couldn’t keep it at home.</span> <span id="s1186">With a little money -- with a very, very little money.</span> <span id="s1187">When I came back from the camp, I -- Peppy had -- had the -- the paper.</span> <span id="s1188">I took the coat out and Mrs. Needelhile sold it for me.</span> <span id="s1189">This was my money, because I didn’t have any money.</span> <span id="s1190">Didn’t have a big aba -- bank account or something.</span> <span id="s1191">And she’s -- she sold it for me, very well.</span> <span id="s1192">But people could buy at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">Q: Describe the circumstance with your mother needing a dentist.</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">A: Yeah, I -- my -- yeah, my mother needed a dentist and with protection, s -- and -- and a dentist, because there was no Jewish dentist, a Jew -- a dentist was prepared to treat her, when she pays in gold.</span> <span id="s1195">And she had to give two necklaces, when he said how much it is worth [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1196">Had two good presents for his wife, and -- I suppose.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">Q: So he was willing to disobey --</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">A: He did --</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">Q: For [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">A: Yeah, yeah, because he wasn’t interested in her Jewishness, he was interested in her money.</span> <span id="s1201">He wanted to -- to -- to get the money.</span> <span id="s1202">As a -- he had not a -- something it -- I may sa -- as a -- a feeling, a racial feeling or anything.</span> <span id="s1203">This was not a hate, but there were no -- no Jewish dentists and when he treats a Jew, he had -- she had to pay with gold.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">Q: Did you think in Osterberg that you would be leaving and going back to Vienna, to be with your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">A: I -- I don -- my mother wasn’t there and I didn’t want to go back to Vienna.</span> <span id="s1206">No, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">Q: You didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">A: I could live easier in Germany than in Vienna, because I don’t -- don’t know how the Germans -- how the Viennese behave, but I didn’t know anything about the Germans.</span> <span id="s1209">And I would have stayed in Germany, because of my profession.</span> <span id="s1210">And I’ve -- I felt appreciated and I f-felt -- had friends and I -- I would have stayed in Germany, I had -- and, but I never wanted to go back to Vienna.</span> <span id="s1211">Actually, Bruno Kriseker wrote me once I should go and told me where to go and where to turn to, but this I couldn’t slee -- I -- I didn’t want to go back to Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">Q: Didn’t -- you’re ta -- you’re now talking about after the war, you didn’t want to go back to Europe, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">A: No, after the war, I didn’t want to go</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">Q: But, I mean, when you were in Osterberg, you thought you were protecting your mother in some way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">A: Yeah, I -- I was suppose -- I -- I thought, as long as I am working, she is protected.</span> <span id="s1216">It -- it did -- it happened that it didn’t say -- it was so, at first they took all th-the one who had a Polish origin.</span> <span id="s1217">They were ta -- and all the foreigners, they were taking at first and the Austrians were practically the last ones they took.</span> <span id="s1218">And Minna came, because she was a Polish Jew, she -- she was taken before me.</span> <span id="s1219">And -- and many who -- and the -- the girls who were still staying after me, they were usually half-Jews, many.</span> <span id="s1220">But they all were taken, in the end.</span> <span id="s1221">They were not -- there were quite a few ve -- half-Jews.</span> <span id="s1222">They only had wa -- one part was only Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">Q: So, your mother is still in Vienna, you’re sent to Asherslabin in October --</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">A: On the -- on the 13th of October.</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">Q: In 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">A: And ears we were, as on the 24th of September, the Jewish star, the yellow star was introduced.</span> <span id="s1227">And we were, at that time, only six girls in -- in Osterberg and we decided that this is impossible to wear such a thing, we couldn’t go into the shops any more with a Jewish star.</span> <span id="s1228">So we decided not to wear it and we didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">Q: So wait a minute.</span> <span id="s1230">It’s October 14th, 1941 [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">A: Nineteen forty -- and -- and on the 24th of September, ‘41, it was introduced.</span> <span id="s1232">We wrote -- we ha -- we got from the police the order to write to a Jewish community to send those to us.</span> <span id="s1233">Iso -- we thought Vienna is further away, we will get it later on fo -- later from Vienna than from Berlin, so we wrote to Vienna.</span> <span id="s1234">But they send it post wendit, at once we had the stars.</span> <span id="s1235">And then we decided it is impossible to go with that to shop -- to a shop and we didn’t wear it.</span> <span id="s1236">And we -- we -- we just didn’t -- ignored it and we wore it only on the 13th of October, when we had to go to Asherslabin, we had to wear it.</span> <span id="s1237">But in -- in the meantime, this fortnight, we lived happily and shopped happily without the star.</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">Q: And you -- nobody was punished because they didn’t wear it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">A: Nobody was punished and nobody was -- was talking about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">Q: But you wore it when you went to Asherslabin?</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">A: Yeah, then we had to -- when we left, we had to wear it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">Q: And did you then wear it throughout the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">A: We had to wear it in the factory and we had to wear it.</span> <span id="s1244">Once we went, as o -- we were allowed to go out on Sundays for two or three hours, I don’t know any more, beese -- we had to have a paper, but we were to alot.</span> <span id="s1245">And the Jewish families were very nice to us.</span> <span id="s1246">They invited every week people -- some of us for tea and helped when you did need somebody -- something or so and they helped in every way they could.</span> <span id="s1247">And once we were on the way to a ji -- Jewish family, four or five girls, I don’t know any more and German boys came against -- came on the other direction and when they passed us, these German boys, they said, “Kriksdani.”</span> <span id="s1248">This means lucky stars.</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">Q: Lucky stars?</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">A: Lucky stars.</span> <span id="s1251">But they didn’t incite us or anything and I -- I thought, his rarewish should be, too, yes.</span> <span id="s1252">I think if they had never safie, in-in this church family was a boy.</span> <span id="s1253">Be-Before five, no child had to wear the stars.</span> <span id="s1254">Up fi -- up to age of five -- after five, they had to wear the stars.</span> <span id="s1255">And this boy was four years old, he didn’t have to wear the stars.</span> <span id="s1256">And he went through half of Asherslabin alone to playmate, to play there and they didn’t wo-worry that something would happen to the Jewish boy.</span> <span id="s1257">He went -- he -- he walks through Asherslabin when everybody would know in -- in the district that he’s a Jewish boy, but nobody was worried.</span> <span id="s1258">I -- he wa -- he -- didn’t happen, anything to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">Q:

Rushow, to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1264">I helped them packing and -- and -- but nobody did know at that time, I think, that it is really more asa death.</span> <span id="s1265">Everybody hopes that it will be finished, the war and it -- nobody expected anything good.</span> <span id="s1266">But I don’t think that -- that we -- I didn’t know and I don’t think that they did know.</span> <span id="s1267">Because they wrote still kait -- as I say, one of these woman wrote then that [indecipherable] husband in Rushow, they made [indecipherable] that he helped so much -- as -- they were in -- in Rushow.</span> <span id="s1268">Actually, it was forbidden to -- as a -- it was allowed to send parcels to Poland, because there were so many German soldiers.</span> <span id="s1269">Pound parcels, small ones, for presents.</span> <span id="s1270">And from Vienna, when people were there, I wanted to send it, but when you -- you had to address it to the Judenrat, as a -- this was an -- when you went to a Post Office with a parcel -- ons -- twas a Judenrat, in Vienna they didn’t take it.</span> <span id="s1271">They didn’t take the post -- Post Office -- so what did I do?</span> <span id="s1272">I went to somebody who spoke Polish and ask Judenrat, what is Judenrat in Polish?</span> <span id="s1273">And I wrote on the Judenrat in Polish on the ped -- on the parcel and then they took it and it arrived.</span> <span id="s1274">Because we -- I got it -- I -- I -- I got to send it, it arrive, because in Vienna they took it, because they didn’t understand it.</span> <span id="s1275">And I didn’t go to the same Post Office again.</span> <span id="s1276">I went always to different Post Offices and I sends, in this way, to the ghetto, some parcels which arrived.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">Q: Now this is after you’ve left the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">A: This was before I left the camp, before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">Q: Right,

to say.</span> <span id="s1509">Maybe in the beginning, when -- when I’ll ask for cigarettes.</span> <span id="s1510">I never have smoked a cigarette in my life, but it was meant for the French.</span> <span id="s1511">I wouldn’t write, “This is for the French prisoner.”</span> <span id="s1512">But this was understood.</span> <span id="s1513">Peppy did know I’d -- I’m not smoking.</span> <span id="s1514">And many of these things.</span> <span id="s1515">Men once, to tell you about the -- there were girls in another camp and they went home and they had contact with the French prisoners, more contact, because the camp of the French prisoners was near.</span> <span id="s1516">And when they got home, they send me a parcel with men’s underwear, for the French prisoners.</span> <span id="s1517">I suppose they were complaining that they didn’t have underwear to change or something.</span> <span id="s1518">Now, I should give it to the prisoners.</span> <span id="s1519">How can -- can I go and give a French prisoner a present?</span> <span id="s1520">What to do?</span> <span id="s1521">But for me it was a holy duty to do what -- what is asked for me.</span> <span id="s1522">So one night -- this was in Osterberg, one night I went out by the window with this parcel.</span> <span id="s1523">In the parcel was no letter or anything, was only pure underwear.</span> <span id="s1524">I thought this was such a -- a parcel with pants or what -- what -- for the -- for the men.</span> <span id="s1525">And I went out by the window and went on the -- in the field and put the -- the parcel down, because I could speak to the French in French and tell them to go and collect it.</span> <span id="s1526">But I must have been seen.</span> <span id="s1527">When I told them, the parcel was stolen, they didn’t get it.</span> <span id="s1528">So I -- somebody mu -- but I was not denounced for it.</span> <span id="s1529">Somebody must have seen me and it wasn’t -- it didn’t come to the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s1530">So, the parcel, but they didn’t get the underwear.</span> <span id="s1531">I am so sorry.</span> <span id="s1532">But I -- it was a very exciting outing for me.</span> <span id="s1533">You can imagine in the -- in the night of -- to go out in the field.</span> <span id="s1534">But this was a -- a duty I had to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">Q: Were you upset when Minna left?</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">Q: When Minna left?</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">A: Yeah, no -- of course I was upset.</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">Q: It must have been difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">Q: And you kept hearing from her, up to a certain point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">A: Yeah, I have heard a little bit of hers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">Q: Cause her letters, at least from the way in which you wrote about them, seem very depressed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">A: Yes, yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">Q: You were not sure what was going on in Poland, or did you become more sure [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">A: No, I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1547">I didn’t know anything, no.</span> <span id="s1548">An-And didn’t expect anything good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">Q: No way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">A: Das a anything good.</span> <span id="s1551">I -- I thought it will be worse than our position in -- in -- in the camp, but what was going on, I didn’t know and I don’t think that anybody know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">Q: It -- there are two different letters, where your mother seems to be seeing one person named Weiss, a man and then Housner, who’s [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">A: Housner, as a he -- she -- she had met somebody in that time, I didn’t know -- I -- I’ve never met him and she ha-had -- she was only 40 -- end of -- end of 40 and she had some-somebody who was caring for her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1554">Q: So that was good, that she wasn’t alone?</span></p> <p><span id="s1555">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">Q: At that -- at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">Q: What were you writing to your mother?</span> <span id="s1559">Were you just writing very simple letters about what was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">A: I didn’t -- I didn’t write about anything bad.</span> <span id="s1561">So it didn’t make he-her worry.</span> <span id="s1562">I didn’t -- I -- I didn’t do that.</span> <span id="s1563">Usually I wrote what I have sent her and once I have sent her apples and she send it back as apple strudel.</span> <span id="s1564">Said -- she said, with an apfel strudel -- this is what I wrote to her, she shouldn’t send it back.</span> <span id="s1565">But she -- she made apfel strudel, send it back to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">Q: And you wanted her to eat it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">Q: And you wanted her to eat the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1570">And -- and I have sent in many, many parcels to her and to Remus.</span> <span id="s1571">Many, many parcels of food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">Q: You could have left for a few days to go to Vienna, had you been married, but you couldn’t leave as a single woman to go visit your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1573">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1574">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1575">This what made me very, very cross.</span> <span id="s1576">Because I would have done it, if I could help somebody in a -- in such a way.</span> <span id="s1577">I would have done it.</span> <span id="s1578">But he had an -- an iron bar, behind this I was not allowed.</span> <span id="s1579">And this was his mother.</span> <span id="s1580">And he was a very -- as a -- he liked comfort and he liked to be -- he -- he didn’t work and he liked the comfortable life.</span> <span id="s1581">To read and to eat and mother’s looking after him and so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">Q: So it made it doubly hard for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">Q: It made it doubly hard for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">A: No, it didn’t.</span> <span id="s1586">It -- it -- it -- I felt that h-his obligation to me is not the same than my obligation to him.</span> <span id="s1587">This I felt in that way.</span> <span id="s1588">And this made me decide not to marry him.</span> <span id="s1589">Even when I could go ba -- when -- after the war, I would not have married him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">Q: What were you thinking about when you knew that parents and children were sent together, that your mother wo -- presumably would be in Vienna, until --</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1592">I -- ine come -- yeah, no, but I think amin -- I could help her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">Q: If you would be together?</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">A: In a camp or anywhere, yes.</span> <span id="s1595">I wanted to go with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">Q: So you assumed -- w-why were you allowed to go to Vienna in June?</span> <span id="s1597">Why was that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">A: I was -- this was -- the Gestapo ask for me to come, because my mother was supported and -- and I was -- this was normal, this was normal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">Q: So it was your turn?</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">A: Yes, it was my turn.</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">Q: Now, when you left Asherslabin --</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">Q: You took your -- you ripped your star off your coat?</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1605">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">Q: That was very dangerous to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">A: Yeah, it was -- what was not dangerous in that -- this -- in -- in that time?</span> <span id="s1608">Everything was dangerous.</span> <span id="s1609">I was -- we were six, about, I think, who left.</span> <span id="s1610">And we decided not to know each other.</span> <span id="s1611">Only two -- nit -- in -- in groups.</span> <span id="s1612">Because six a-attract attention and we traveled in twos and not in the same carriage, in very different carriages.</span> <span id="s1613">We agreed about it, we planned it in that way.</span> <span id="s1614">And I -- I talk -- and we took off and I thought the star was only fixed in a way that you could riff -- rip it off at once.</span> <span id="s1615">At first I put my -- my handbag on top, because we -- as a -- at once I had my handbag on -- on top of it.</span> <span id="s1616">This is -- was -- is folded.</span> <span id="s1617">And then -- as soon -- we -- we took them off.</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">Q: So all of you took them off, also?</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">A: Yeah, all the others.</span> <span id="s1620">I think so.</span> <span id="s1621">Nobody traveled with this impossible star and but we made it sure that we do not know each other and that we do not aerate any attention -- attract any attention to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">Q: So where -- where did you pull it off?</span> <span id="s1623">Were you -- di-did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">A: On the toilet.</span> <span id="s1625">I went to the toilet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">Q: [indecipherable] y-you went alone?</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">A: Yeah, I went to the toilet and put it off.</span> <span id="s1628">It was only on the coat, not on the -- it was all prepared to be sewed off -- of putting it off igitta -- ripping it off again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1629">Q: And the six of you, when you thought of this, when you sat to -- you -- you talked about this in Asherslabin, I gather?</span></p> <p><span id="s1630">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1631">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1632">Before you left.</span> <span id="s1633">And the idea of pulling it off was what?</span> <span id="s1634">Why -- you just thought it would be --</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">A: No, as a -- who wants to go out with -- with -- with such a style on.</span> <span id="s1636">Of course we -- this wa -- it was natural.</span></p> <p><span id="s1637">Q: And the clothes you were wearing, were these the clothes that you had brought originally, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1638">A: No, we couldn’t buy any clothes there, but I have bood -- yes, what I had.</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">Q: So, you go to Vienna and you discover what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">A: In Vienna, Peppy and his mother, of course.</span> <span id="s1641">His mother didn’t let him be with me on -- alone.</span> <span id="s1642">His mother came to collect me and they were very glad I came without the star.</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">Q: This is at the train station?</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">A: Yeah, at the -- at the train station, yeah.</span> <span id="s1645">And then I was staying with my cousin.</span> <span id="s1646">I had a cousin in Vienna.</span> <span id="s1647">She had been married to a Gentile, a Czech -- a Czech it was.</span> <span id="s1648">And he was a soldier and fell in the war.</span> <span id="s1649">He was dead, already.</span> <span id="s1650">And he fell in Russia, on the Russian front.</span> <span id="s1651">And the -- 1940, a son was born to them and this son, because she married after 1936, was regarded as Jew.</span> <span id="s1652">And his father had given his life for Germany, but he didn’t get any normal rations.</span> <span id="s1653">He got only Jewish car -- Jewish cards.</span> <span id="s1654">Then, when I had my daughter then, later on, I -- my daughter got normal cards, because sh -- they thought she’s an Aryan.</span> <span id="s1655">And she got three-quarters of a liter milk.</span> <span id="s1656">And the cards were n-nationally.</span> <span id="s1657">I send -- I got two cards, one card for half a liter and one card for a quarter of a liter.</span> <span id="s1658">And they -- ga -- ga -- the liter, the quarter of a liter went to Vienna for little Otto.</span> <span id="s1659">That this -- this boy got -- get some milk too.</span> <span id="s1660">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1661">Q: So you stayed with her?</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">A: I stayed with her a few days and -- but she -- she wrote me, she invited me to stay with her when I come.</span> <span id="s1663">But she expected after a few days, I’m going to Poland.</span> <span id="s1664">Yes, n-not that I’m staying with her for longer.</span> <span id="s1665">Dangerous person what I am.</span> <span id="s1666">And -- and she -- she -- when I was there, she was already -- atha -- I was staying -- overstaying my invi -- invitation already.</span> <span id="s1667">Overstaying.</span> <span id="s1668">And she made -- made it clear to me that she doesn’t want me too long -- that she doesn’t want me any more.</span> <span id="s1669">She made it clear to me.</span> <span id="s1670">And then I had to find some -- another place where to stay.</span> <span id="s1671">This wasn’t easy and I me -- once I met -- he was a Jew, a -- a -- a brother of Mr. Rumer, Onkefelas we called him and he took me -- he was a Jew, but h-he could live -- he had a flat in what they called Himindaball -- in the community, from -- what belongs to -- to the community.</span> <span id="s1672">And he was -- had told them he had to bring the Aryan now -- asa -- the -- the proof that he’s an Aryan, what he didn’t -- was -- he wasn’t and he didn’t have any proo -- proof and he told them that his documents are at the moment in South Africa in the hands of her sister, because he is emigrating to there and he hasn’t the documents.</span> <span id="s1673">And this was again, this man does -- didn’t care much.</span> <span id="s1674">And so he was staying in that flat.</span> <span id="s1675">And he took me -- but an -- an old man could not easily take a la -- young girl into his house.</span> <span id="s1676">I stayed the night with him -- he may have take -- kept me in another night or something, but an old man cannot keep a young girl in his flat, this is clear.</span> <span id="s1677">Somebody would notice that there is a -- a young girl going out and in.</span> <span id="s1678">This was -- was -- as a -- one, but in-interesting is when I was there, going round in Vienna, I met one -- he was a bit younger than I was, from the socialist middulshunabrunt.</span> <span id="s1679">He was actually the opeman at that time.</span> <span id="s1680">His name was Cootberger.</span> <span id="s1681">And he had an idea.</span> <span id="s1682">He wrote -- he said he is not a Jew, he was exchanged in the nursing home.</span> <span id="s1683">It was in a -- a -- a difficult -- he was taken for a Jew, but this was not -- are not his parents.</span> <span id="s1684">His parents were others.</span> <span id="s1685">And he made an application to Berlin, to some office and the Nazis took that seriously.</span> <span id="s1686">Can you imagine?</span> <span id="s1687">That this was the Nazi time.</span> <span id="s1688">They took it seriously.</span> <span id="s1689">And he was going around in Vienna because he’s appi -- his application was still in Berlin.</span> <span id="s1690">But, for a long time -- but in the end, as a -- I don’t know -- he disappeared as well.</span> <span id="s1691">But from -- for months or years or something, I don’t know exactly how long it was, he was going around and telling, as a -- because his application that he is exchanged in the nursing home.</span> <span id="s1692">But how silly, how silly.</span> <span id="s1693">But they -- this is -- is bureaucracy, German bureaucracy.</span> <span id="s1694">I laughed -- we laughed about it -- I laughed about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">Q: Edith, who was -- if I can go back for a moment, what was the name of your cousin?</span></p> <p><span id="s1696">A: Ju-Julia Andre.</span> <span id="s1697">She’s still live -- alive.</span> <span id="s1698">She’s living in Vienna, still.</span></p> <p><span id="s1699">Q: Now, I -- I -- I know the answer to this question in a way, but I’m going to ask it anyway.</span> <span id="s1700">Peppy and his mother did not offer [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1701">A: No, no -- I have never -- never slept a night in -- in her flat.</span> <span id="s1702">But he -- Peppy must have had a -- a pressure on her, because I wasn’t sleeping in that flat -- in the house of the -- of other people, where she has the key to.</span> <span id="s1703">And she had the key to a flat and I suppose -- I suppose Peppy must have had a pressure -- pressure on her, because she drewls quite the time until she off -- until I had that possibility.</span> <span id="s1704">And I -- I slept in that house -- in that flat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">Q: So, was that after you left that older man, that you slept --</span></p> <p><span id="s1706">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1707">I was going around, I was asking other people and I had -- I’ve heard no -- I have I’m sorry, I’m very sorry, but I -- there was no room for me.</span> <span id="s1708">It was a ha -- terrible time.</span> <span id="s1709">Can you imagine going around -- and in -- in daytime, I was not staying in -- in Peppy’s flat.</span> <span id="s1710">I was in the street.</span> <span id="s1711">I couldn’t go to Crystal because this was in the same house where I have been living, but when I rang her, and said I need something, we met in coff -- in Kuffy’s and they always came at once.</span> <span id="s1712">Always.</span> <span id="s1713">She and Elsa.</span> <span id="s1714">They al -- this was -- I could trust them and could hopes them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1715">Q: Now Elsa’s the sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s1716">A: Elsa is her youngest sist -- she’s still alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1717">Q: Crystal is still alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s1718">A: Crys-Crystal, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">Q: No.</span> <span id="s1720">But the other --</span></p> <p><span id="s1721">A: Crystal died.</span></p> <p><span id="s1722">Q: But Elsa is --</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">A: Elsa is alive, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">Q: This is Crystal Denner?</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">A: Crystal Denner, Crys -- Christina Maria Marguerita Denner was her name.</span></p> <p><span id="s1726">Q: Then Crystal was the sort of nickname?</span></p> <p><span id="s1727">A: Yes, when I met her, she was called Teeny, but this was then changed to Crystal.</span> <span id="s1728">This seemed to be more grown up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1729">Q: Edith, when did you find out -- as soon as you arrived in -- in Vienna, did you re -- y-you knew that your mother was already deported?</span></p> <p><span id="s1730">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1731">I did know it, I think I did know it already before I came.</span> <span id="s1732">I don’t know, exactly.</span> <span id="s1733">But I -- I -- I found -- she was gone.</span> <span id="s1734">Because she wanted me -- she wrote me a card that they have to go and she was -- she wrote a card and she wrote -- she tried to -- she had courage, she wrote and she ask again for me.</span> <span id="s1735">And these SS mens ask her how old I am and she said 28 and he said, she can go on her own.</span> <span id="s1736">She saved my life.</span> <span id="s1737">Otherwise I would have gone with her on -- with her, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1738">Q: One of the other women that you [indecipherable] start to say something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1739">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1740">End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1741">A: -- can go on her own.</span> <span id="s1742">She saved my life.</span> <span id="s1743">Otherwise I would have gone with her on -- with her, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1744">Q: One of the other women that you [indecipherable] start to say something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1745">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1746">Q: You were starting to say something?</span></p> <p><span id="s1747">A: But I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">Q: I said, you were going to start to say something, I don’t want to interrupt you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">A: I didn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s1750">Q: Ah.</span> <span id="s1751">One of the women that you came with to Vienna --</span></p> <p><span id="s1752">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1753">Q: -- who also took off her star --</span></p> <p><span id="s1754">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1755">Q: -- got very frightened of the circumstances --</span></p> <p><span id="s1756">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1757">Q: -- and decided to go to collection center.</span></p> <p><span id="s1758">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1759">Q: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1760">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1761">In the end I would have to go, too, when they could not -- vay -- if -- if I had not found -- if all that -- not that SS man has given me this advice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1762">Q: You would have had to go, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1763">A: I couldn’t -- you -- you -- I could not -- for years, live -- live in that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1764">Q: So for how long were you living in that apartment that Peppy’s mother had the key to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">A: This was -- itho this -- I went to Mun-Munich at the beginning of August, I don’t know the date, the fifth or sixth of August and this was -- I went -- I came to Vienna in -- at -- at the end of June.</span> <span id="s1766">At first Mrs. Needelhile sent me -- I must have looked awful, for a rest to a farmer she was in contact with.</span> <span id="s1767">For if -- he didn’t know that I’m Jewish.</span> <span id="s1768">I don’t know what she told him, I should come there to have a -- when I came there and got a -- a normal meal, I was at once ill.</span> <span id="s1769">I couldn’t stand a normal meal any more.</span> <span id="s1770">But this was a real Nazi, 100 percent Nazi, they didn’t know anything about me and I was so terribly shocked about the opinion and about the life they had that I was glad to be underground again -- and -- and go -- and -- and left -- when I left them, it was a few days.</span> <span id="s1771">And I was thankful not to be there any more, in spite of the food and everything, because th-this was the first time and the only time I was in really Nazi environment.</span> <span id="s1772">H-He was leader of the farmers and -- ma -- na -- they treated me well and I had the room and I went out with him on -- and -- to -- but i-it was mentally horrible.</span> <span id="s1773">I couldn’t -- I -- it was horrible, it was -- the only one thing to -- i-it was sh -- I was shocked.</span> <span id="s1774">I was glad to be -- to be away again.</span> <span id="s1775">And then I went back to Vienna and -- and I was apelsush -- my cousin said -- in the house, I am a relation of her dead husband” So that this is not -- that nobody is --

told me exactly what is necessary to survive.</span> <span id="s1859">It wasn’t a long -- I said, “Thank you.”</span> <span id="s1860">I didn’t think of money and he didn’t ask any money.</span> <span id="s1861">I couldn’t have paid for that.</span> <span id="s1862">He mentioned what -- what it was worth for me.</span> <span id="s1863">I couldn’t have paid for that.</span> <span id="s1864">I didn’t -- didn’t talk about money.</span> <span id="s1865">It wasn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s1866">Q: Can you tell us what it -- I mean I know you wrote about it in the letter, can you tell us something

weeks you were away.</span> <span id="s1869">And he told me that my friend should get such a document and should go -- should tell the police that she has lost it, that her hus -- her bag with the document fell into the water -- in the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1870">She was -- and from the boat.</span> <span id="s1871">And he warned me even, that she ha -- she should not say it was torn, the documents, by a dog or anything, because the police could ask for -- for proof.</span> <span id="s1872">And -- and then he told me that I -- how to get a document with a -- with a lik -- with a photo.</span> <span id="s1873">And then he told me I should never ask for a -- for points for dresses, klidakartae -- for -- it was called klidakartae.</span> <span id="s1874">I should never ask for that.</span> <span id="s1875">This he told me too, because this is in -- is for the rye -- for the -- for the whole country.</span> <span id="s1876">And I should never ask for identity card.</span> <span id="s1877">He told me too.</span> <span id="s1878">As a identity card, what -- what was called kenung’s card at that time and then he -- this is -- he -- he told me -- he looked me up, he said -- as a -- I am -- I am looking well.</span> <span id="s1879">He -- he -- also said -- and he wished me good luck and then I went.</span> <span id="s1880">I said, “Thank you,” and went.</span> <span id="s1881">And he said of course I have to loo -- to -- to go away from Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s1882">Q: He’s -- he’s recognized at Yad Vashem, Platner?</span></p> <p><span id="s1883">A: Yes, yeah.</span> <span id="s1884">And this happened -- I didn’t know about these things, how did I know [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1885">I -- I went to the library in Edgeware and found the book -- fell in the book -- a love story in my hand, “Max and Helen,” by Simon Wiesenthal.</span> <span id="s1886">And I took it only because it was Simon Wiesenthal because love stories are -- is not my usual line of books what I am reading.</span> <span id="s1887">And I read it and he wrote in that -- right in that -- he -- he describes the -- how this couple came in contact with -- with la -- with camps and survive and he wrote, “We should not forget these people who helped us.”</span> <span id="s1888">And then I was thinking of -- of Crystal and I copied the sentence he has written in my letter to him, I wrote to -- to -- I didn’t know his direct address, I wrote to Vienna and I wrote -- I -- I sent -- I wrote the sentence in the -- in -- in -- in the letter and I wrote that Crystal Denner helped me.</span> <span id="s1889">But I didn’t write a long stories.</span> <span id="s1890">And he answered me at once.</span> <span id="s1891">He wrote to me, “I just came back from -- from America and found your letter” and he answered me at once and said he must know more.</span> <span id="s1892">He is contact with Israeli -- with -- with Yad Vashem and with the documents entering Israel and I must tell him more, so I told him more and he had -- took up contact with Crystal.</span> <span id="s1893">Crystal had an interview with him and then it was arranged -- he arranged it, I had nothing done any more and then the Israeli embassy made a celebration in -- in Vienna.</span> <span id="s1894">There were about 200 people or something.</span> <span id="s1895">And there was another woman -- another woman who had saved somebody and she and this other woman got medals.</span></p> <p><span id="s1896">Q: So Crystal -- Christine Denner got a medal?</span></p> <p><span id="s1897">A: Yes, she got a medal and I -- I -- a very nice medal in all leaf -- i-in -- a very nice medal and then I got one Yad Vashem [indecipherable] knew that she is -- that they’re happy to tell me that she ca -- is choo -- chosen to be -- have a -- a tree in Yad Vashem.</span></p> <p><span id="s1898">Q: But not Platner?</span></p> <p><span id="s1899">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1900">Q: Not Platner?</span></p> <p><span id="s1901">A: No, I didn’t talk about Platner at all.</span> <span id="s1902">I didn’t -- I thought this -- I didn’t know anything, I haven’t ha -- seen or helped him.</span> <span id="s1903">I was talking -- actually Crystal did -- did sadate and it was her.</span> <span id="s1904">Sh -- The others could say I have given her an advice or something, I can’t remember or this is not true or something.</span> <span id="s1905">But she went and gave the -- went to the police and gave the wrong aclare -- declaration on us.</span> <span id="s1906">That she has to de -- and this declaration, what -- what happened that the police says is here, in the documents.</span></p> <p><span id="s1907">Q: Well, we have to take a break now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1908">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1909">Q: Did we go over?</span></p> <p><span id="s1910">End of Tape Three, Side B Beginning Tape Four, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1911">Q: Edith, can you talk a little bit more about Christine or Crystal Denner, because I know that after you leave Platner, she’s going to help you a great deal.</span> <span id="s1912">Tell us a little bit about her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1913">A: Oh gee.</span> <span id="s1914">Her -- her father wanted to marry her and brought German officers into the house.</span> <span id="s1915">When -- when -- when there was somebody for dinner, I was always invited at the dinner, too.</span> <span id="s1916">But she didn’t want -- didn’t want anybody.</span> <span id="s1917">She had -- when she was 15 and sh-she met a -- a young man, he was a half-Jew and she’s -- was later on her husband.</span> <span id="s1918">I was at the -- I was with her when she met him and no other -- no other boy or man or -- was -- had any hope.</span> <span id="s1919">She was quarreling with him and not quarreling and going out with him and not going out with him and I -- I -- I was always with -- with her in that thing and later on, after the war, sh-she -- she married him.</span> <span id="s1920">He was -- his father was a Jew from Czechoslovakia, but he was married to a non-Jew.</span> <span id="s1921">They had a house in Vienna and they had a business of -- of things -- pipes and such things.</span> <span id="s1922">And they had a car, they were well off people and had a house and he’d think they were well off people.</span> <span id="s1923">And his father -- I think it was Crystal’s father who did it, but that didn’t -- he pretended that he is not a Jew and Crystal’s father, I think he was in Czechoslovakia and ra -- and t-tore out the book in -- out of the books what he pretended, so that he pretended that he’s not a Jew.</span> <span id="s1924">But he was found out.</span> <span id="s1925">And there was a trial and he was sentenced to prison and was sent to a prison in -- in Vienna -- ou-outside Vienna, to a prison.</span> <span id="s1926">This is why he survived.</span> <span id="s1927">Because, as a Jew he would be murdered, but as a prisoner, he survived.</span> <span id="s1928">This -- the parents were divorced, but more or less only because to keep the house.</span> <span id="s1929">They kept in touch.</span> <span id="s1930">He was then living in -- in -- in a different district, but they kept in touch.</span> <span id="s1931">And after the war -- and -- and -- when it came out, Hans Baron was his name, Baerchi he was called at school, he -- he was sent back from the army -- he was in the army and as his father was then a Jew, so he was sent from -- and he was not in the army and he was denounced once, because he was walk -- walking about -- that he’s a deserter.</span> <span id="s1932">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1933">Somebody -- he was missing, I think Crystal and so forth, but he was in -- before the end of the war, he was denounce, but he was legally out of the army, so it didn’t matter.</span> <span id="s1934">But this is the danger that he was -- he was denounced by somebody in -- in the district and after the war they got married this -- and had a son.</span></p> <p><span id="s1935">Q: And Crystal was never a Nazi?</span></p> <p><span id="s1936">A: No.</span> <span id="s1937">She was never a Nazi, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1938">Q: Talk about her being in the -- the women’s organization, the girl’s organization --</span></p> <p><span id="s1939">A: Oh, she was in -- I -- I thought this was automatically in the bundeutshameet and in the Nazi time, not only that -- because when the Nazi came, these two girls were living on their own, their father was somewhere in -- in the army, they got a -- from -- from the court.</span> <span id="s1940">Somebody shu -- a -- a guardian, that they were mi -- minors and were living on their own, they got mine -- a guardian.</span> <span id="s1941">And this guardian, this Nazi guardian came and at once she fell on the polished floor and fell down and it was su-such an unhappy meeting, that she didn’t come any more.</span> <span id="s1942">She was out of -- of the -- she -- she fell down and asuz -- this was no chemistry between them.</span> <span id="s1943">The guardian didn’t -- didn’t appear any more, she was gone.</span> <span id="s1944">And she -- she was in the bunter-buntdeutshamashin and didn’t fit in -- didn’t want to fit in, either.</span> <span id="s1945">And was then thrown out by a registered letter, that she’s not allowed to wear the uniform, which she didn’t want to do in any case and we had a good laugh about such things -- about such things, we have -- really we -- we -- it was our entertainment.</span> <span id="s1946">And then she was -- all young people were sent to work, the girls, to families which have many children, this was it.</span> <span id="s1947">She was sent somewhere, I don’t know where it was and was -- when she went, because she was at that age, that this was like drafting and she was at that age, she was this -- had decided to come back and not to stay, before.</span> <span id="s1948">And she had -- she -- they were not allowed to have money, but she had hidden the money for the fare back -- at once and in this c-camp, she had purposely a fall, that she could go to the doctor and the doctor sent her then home.</span> <span id="s1949">She pur -- as a -- she planted.</span></p> <p><span id="s1950">Q: So, when you left Platner, what did you do?</span> <span id="s1951">Did you go very quickly to [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1952">A: I -- I wa -- I met Peppy with them and Peppy was with me when I told her and she didn’t hesitate a minute.</span> <span id="s1953">She didn’t he -- sh-she -- th-they -- they always -- even when I was in the camp before, when I did need something, maybe a pair of shoes, ma -- you couldn’t buy anything, whatever they could, they send me.</span> <span id="s1954">And my mother could turn to them, that I need something and they -- I always had letters, I always was in contact with her and she -- when -- and now, when I came back, I -- I couldn’t go to her flight.</span> <span id="s1955">I went into the shop, in the camp ashlasser and -- and -- but not to have -- to have flight, because of -- when we have li -- been living 20 years in the same house, it was too dangerous.</span> <span id="s1956">But she -- when I say, come to that coffee house, she would come at once.</span> <span id="s1957">She -- they would leave everything and we have met.</span></p> <p><span id="s1958">Q: And so, what did she agree to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1959">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s1960">Q: What did she -- what -- what did Crystal do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1961">A: Once, I wanted to go to a swimming -- swimming.</span> <span id="s1962">So I ask Crystal f-for a swimming -- a swimming costume.</span> <span id="s1963">I got it at once.</span> <span id="s1964">I mean this was -- this was -- I -- whatever they could, they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1965">Q: So, when you came and told her what Platner had said --</span></p> <p><span id="s1966">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1967">Q: Crystal then immediately gave you her papers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1968">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1969">She -- yeah, no, she had to go -- th-they wanted, in any case, to go on holiday to Minsta, where her father was in the flak and Elsa especially said as I should go with them.</span> <span id="s1970">I should go with them to -- but I couldn’t -- Jews were -- were not allowed to travel on the -- on -- on the -- on the railway.</span> <span id="s1971">I couldn’t go with them and so -- and -- and then, because she said -- h-her father said there’s more to eat and I should go with them, but I couldn’t go and she had, in any case, I don’t know if she had it already, this paper, for the holiday, but the holiday was planned and -- or if she just get it and she gave me the paper and said -- and went to the police.</span> <span id="s1972">Very easily -- she was very -- when she did grow up in that district, she was not a stranger who comes from anywhere and the police -- she was -- police believed her and she ga -- she got replicas.</span></p> <p><span id="s1973">Q: So she was the one who said I lost my --</span></p> <p><span id="s1974">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1975">Q: -- in the water and I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1976">A: Yes, she told the story and -- and it was of course believed.</span> <span id="s1977">Min -- she grew up in that district and it is very plausible that her handbag had fall into the weet -- into the water on the Altadona.</span></p> <p><span id="s1978">Q: Edith, what papers did you have?</span> <span id="s1979">You were not wearing a star?</span></p> <p><span id="s1980">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1981">Q: But you said -- I understand the Jews could not travel on the trains.</span></p> <p><span id="s1982">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1983">Q: Right?</span> <span id="s1984">But how were you identified?</span> <span id="s1985">People knew who you were?</span> <span id="s1986">I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s1987">A: No, I was -- who should ent -- identify me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1988">Q: Well, that’s what I mean.</span> <span id="s1989">Why couldn’t you travel on the train?</span> <span id="s1990">Is it --</span></p> <p><span id="s1991">A: No -- Jews were not allowed to travel on the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s1992">Q: But you didn’t have papers that said you were Jewish.</span> <span id="s1993">Or did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1994">A: No, but I -- I -- could be -- there could be rats here -- I could be found out.</span> <span id="s1995">There were not -- ma-maybe in -- in one of the letters of my mother, she writes they went -- th-they walked to the cemetery, to my father’s grave.</span> <span id="s1996">This was very, very far away.</span> <span id="s1997">This was about two hours walk.</span> <span id="s1998">But, I suppose she could not travel with a star on that -- on that train.</span> <span id="s1999">Sh-She didn’t write, of course.</span> <span id="s2000">I don’t -- I couldn’t -- but she wrote, she -- she -- she was walking to the cemetery and this was very -- is in Vienna very, very far away.</span> <span id="s2001">When you g-go an hour by train.</span> <span id="s2002">And sh -- because she -- I suppose she couldn’t -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2003">She could not travel by -- she wore that star, she could not travel by train to the cemetery.</span></p> <p><span id="s2004">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2005">So, Crystal gets these duplicate coupons.</span></p> <p><span id="s2006">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2007">Q:

Now what happens?</span></p> <p><span id="s2016">A: No th -- I had -- I had to go -- I had to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s2017">Q: And you decided to go where?</span></p> <p><span id="s2018">A: I wa -- I decided to go to Munich, because I had seen a newsreel about the -- about the -- about Munich.</span> <span id="s2019">About the house, the deutshenkuntz.</span> <span id="s2020">About an art exhibition in Munich.</span> <span id="s2021">That was intere -- and -- and it is and it looks ridiculous when I say it, but this afiga in this art exhibition touched me so much, as is would speaking to me, as it would tell me to go.</span> <span id="s2022">And so I decided to seize it, that -- things -- to go to Munich.</span></p> <p><span id="s2023">Q: What was the -- what was the piece of art that spoke to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2024">A: It was -- it -- it was a -- a white -- white marmore --</span></p> <p><span id="s2025">Q: Marble?</span></p> <p><span id="s2026">A: Yes, a marble.</span> <span id="s2027">It was a -- a li -- a -- a woman and a woman lying, but i-it expressed peace so much -- what I missed so much.</span> <span id="s2028">It is worth so much what I missed that I wanted to see it.</span> <span id="s2029">And so I went to Munich and in Munich I had to live somewhere, no?</span> <span id="s2030">And then I bought the mune-munestalaraisinzae only.</span> <span id="s2031">Never before and never afterwards I bought that paper and I looked a-among -- among the rooms to let and there was one room to let -- not in Munich, outside Munich, in Disenhofen, for sewing.</span> <span id="s2032">For wor -- for -- not for money, but for doing some sewing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2033">Q: In exchange for the room?</span></p> <p><span id="s2034">A: In exchange.</span> <span id="s2035">And this fitted me because I didn’t have much money, I didn’t know how long I have to live wi -- on the fur coat of my mother and -- and this fitted me very well and I think I wrote a card with -- like that -- to that place, but then I went there, to -- I went -- I traveled back by night and didn’t know where to sleep in I -- in any case, I traveled by night and in the morning, I traveled to Disenhofen and it was after lunch I arrived and I suppose this was my first day with the wrong papers and with all that and -- and overtired as I was, I must have looked awful.</span> <span id="s2036">And I had a small suitcase and this woman, when I ope -- when they opened the door, and I told her who I am, she put me to bed.</span> <span id="s2037">She didn’t ask much questions.</span> <span id="s2038">Sh-sh-she’s said I shoulds lie down and in -- and I slept and I got coffee and cake into the bed and [indecipherable] is meant in my position.</span> <span id="s2039">I would have worked for -- day and night for her.</span> <span id="s2040">And then we agreed I work three nights -- three days.</span> <span id="s2041">And I made her -- and -- I kno -- did know soon her -- her stories, her life stories.</span> <span id="s2042">I told her that my father, oh, is a widower.</span> <span id="s2043">My mother died.</span> <span id="s2044">Had married a woman not much older than I am and I couldn’t get on -- on with her and so I have decided to leave Vienna, this wa --</span></p> <p><span id="s2045">Q: How -- how did you come up with that story?</span></p> <p><span id="s2046">A: Is very plausible.</span></p> <p><span id="s2047">Q: It’s very plausible.</span></p> <p><span id="s2048">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s2049">Q: Yes, ob-obviously.</span></p> <p><span id="s2050">A: And it is very plausible, so I -- I -- her mother -- Crystal’s mother was dead, this was true, but I had to have a reason why I leave Vienna and people didn’t ask me much.</span> <span id="s2051">Everyone believed it and it was very plausible and people were very tactful, they didn’t ask me more questions.</span> <span id="s2052">And I did know her st -- her life story soon.</span> <span id="s2053">She was a nurse in -- a private nurse for the mother of an yusteetsrad -- a Jewish yusteetsrad, and she was living in the Jewish house.</span> <span id="s2054">And she had -- and this -- the Gestapo had arrested her because they hope that she knows something about money.</span> <span id="s2055">Sec, it was always a money -- there were -- this is not -- is -- I think it doesn’t come out properly in all this -- this talks and they wanted to know about ma -- she didn’t know anything about money, of course.</span> <span id="s2056">But this yusteetsrad was of course, in prison, too.</span> <span id="s2057">Suppose em -- of money and he kneeled for her when they were confronted.</span> <span id="s2058">He kneeled for her and ask her for forgiveness, that she has so much to suffer, because she was employed in that house.</span> <span id="s2059">And then they thought she has a liaison with him, what wasn’t, of course.</span> <span id="s2060">And a -- a fu -- for a full fortnight she was in pris -- she was arrested and then they let her out.</span> <span id="s2061">And she was a Protestant and this was a Catholic place and nobody talked to her, because she was an outsider and this was very nice, too, because nobody asked me any questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s2062">Q: And what was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s2063">A: Gell.</span> <span id="s2064">She died of cancer.</span> <span id="s2065">I had to -- I -- I had contact with her in London, when I was still -- she died of cancer.</span></p> <p><span id="s2066">Q: But you did not -- you -- you couldn’t take the chance of telling her the truth.</span></p> <p><span id="s2067">A: No, I did -- I didn’t tell anybody.</span> <span id="s2068">I didn’t take -- no, no, I didn’t tell anybody.</span> <span id="s2069">I made her a -- a dearmed lerner wasa dearmed liss.</span> <span id="s2070">This is the -- wha -- what people in Austria were for holidays or -- you know what -- th-the folkstrat.</span> <span id="s2071">Th-This is -- and out of -- of the tallah of her -- of the joie yusteetrab, the blaiktella -- net -- he hardly -- I made her a dress of tho -- the blaiktella.</span> <span id="s2072">You know, I found that this had irony for me, because as a -- as a lawyer myself, to make dress out of a tallah of a lawyer, a dress.</span> <span id="s2073">But I did it and I -- I was sewing, but I could -- there was no obligation.</span> <span id="s2074">I could sew whenever I had li -- when I -- ever I wanted, when I said I am going to Munich, so I didn’t do any sewing.</span> <span id="s2075">It was a very easy relationship and we were very, very friendly together and she had a little boy.</span> <span id="s2076">She told me she got married on an -- in the course of an advertisement.</span> <span id="s2077">Yeah, she told me all her life story.</span> <span id="s2078">She was -- had -- had met her husband s -- on -- through -- through an allway advertisement.</span> <span id="s2079">I suppose she had money after they foam the Jews -- after they were -- to buy the house -- that she had a house there, a nice house.</span> <span id="s2080">And she had a second room to let, but I took the smallest one.</span> <span id="s2081">And -- and another room -- I could have changed for a bigger room and I was -- it was a very, very small room and I said I want that room.</span></p> <p><span id="s2082">Q: Was she close in age to you, was she much older?</span></p> <p><span id="s2083">A: She was i-in the 30’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s2084">Q: In the 30’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s2085">A: In the 30’s.</span> <span id="s2086">She had a four or a five year old boy at that time.</span> <span id="s2087">And -- and it -- I so -- it was a very, very easy relationship and I was very free.</span> <span id="s2088">And I went sometimes -- I couldn’t stay always in -- in the house.</span> <span id="s2089">I went to Munich -- I have never been before to Munich and it was a ver -- it was a holiday place at that time.</span> <span id="s2090">There were no bombs.</span> <span id="s2091">Only it was blackout in the evening.</span> <span id="s2092">There were n -- and people from all over the country came to Munich for holidays.</span> <span id="s2093">There was a exhibition and there were opera and this was a -- a -- a real holi -- what I didn’t know before, but it was a real holiday place.</span> <span id="s2094">And there were -- in Munich, it’s a beautiful town and as ha -- as it happened, there were many SS man -- men at that time, there from the Baltic.</span> <span id="s2095">There were -- this -- from latee -- from -- from the Baltic.</span> <span id="s2096">So they couldn’t speak a work of eng -- of German, but were SS men from the Baltic.</span> <span id="s2097">I have seen quite a lot of them.</span> <span id="s2098">This was -- was not my company.</span></p> <p><span id="s2099">Q: Did you go to see the sculpt that you had seen in the film?</span></p> <p><span id="s2100">A: Yeah, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s2101">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2102">A: Of co --</span></p> <p><span id="s2103">Q: Was it as beautiful as you when you [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2104">A: Yes, I liked it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2105">Q: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2106">A: Yes, I liked it.</span> <span id="s2107">I went there and I went to Munich and there were -- I zo -- as it happened, I didn’t have any points of ca-caretakarten and she said she -- she was very nice to me, she said she has a few points over, she would give it to me.</span> <span id="s2108">So we went to a dress shop in Munich to buy something.</span> <span id="s2109">She was with me and I put something on, but her points were -- were not enough for that.</span> <span id="s2110">And the people said it suits me so well, that they gave it to me without points.</span> <span id="s2111">I got the dress and this dress -- what -- she had a few points over, but she didn’t know it, sh-she will get a new card in -- in no time at all and the people in the shop said I -- as a -- it -- it -- it suits me so well, that they gave it to me only for these few points.</span></p> <p><span id="s2112">Q: So, in germ -- in -- in Germany during that period of time, it was a like a ration card for clothes?</span> <span id="s2113">It was --</span></p> <p><span id="s2114">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2115">There was everything ra -- you had -- you could not have your shoe -- shoes you couldn’t get.</span> <span id="s2116">You could not have your shoes repaired without registered some be -- without being registered some.</span> <span id="s2117">In Bramberg when I was, my -- Werner repaired my shoes, because I couldn’t go to a shoemak -- to -- I couldn’t have my shoes repaired.</span> <span id="s2118">And when he was drafted -- when he was -- be -- became a soldier, I did need shoes repaired.</span> <span id="s2119">Then I went to the shoemaker and gave him my shoes.</span> <span id="s2120">He said I am not in -- on his list.</span> <span id="s2121">I said, “You may -- you may find my husband on the list.”</span> <span id="s2122">He was on the list, of course.</span> <span id="s2123">And then he repaired my shoes.</span> <span id="s2124">He thought, because my -- he thought it is -- his nagation said I’m not there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2125">Q: Was it difficult for you to be in Munich walking around with --</span></p> <p><span id="s2126">A: No, it was -- this was not -- was very interesting in a way.</span> <span id="s2127">I’ve never been there before and I went -- I wanted to go to the opera.</span></p> <p><span id="s2128">Q: And you went once with --</span></p> <p><span id="s2129">A: I went to -- to Bohemme -- to see Bohemme.</span> <span id="s2130">I am -- I’m still liking opera and I was --</span></p> <p><span id="s2131">Q: Did you go alone?</span></p> <p><span id="s2132">A: I was in a long queue for a cheap ticket and then came a soldier and ask me if he can say I am his bride.</span> <span id="s2133">So I allowed him to say I am his bride, because the -- the soldiers didn’t have to queue for a tick --</span></p> <p><span id="s2134">Q: So you got in for nothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s2135">A: No, not for nothing, but without queuing.</span> <span id="s2136">I don’t know if I paid or he paid for the ticket.</span> <span id="s2137">I don’t know that any more.</span> <span id="s2138">But I was -- I hadn’t eaten anything and I said I haven’t eaten, we went into a restaurant.</span> <span id="s2139">He must have been officer or something.</span> <span id="s2140">When -- this was full, the restaurant and the waitresses were serving and when we came with the -- sat down and he just got to the waitress -- she was serving somebody.</span> <span id="s2141">Took the plates and put it in front of me.</span> <span id="s2142">And nobody said anything.</span> <span id="s2143">No-Nobody -- as o -- went -- this is what I -- I never did know who is an officer or not.</span> <span id="s2144">But this is what made me think that he was an officer.</span> <span id="s2145">And as it happened, he -- and so we went to the opera and he did know all the -- all the air -- arias of the opera and in the evening, when I went to the station, in the dark things -- he’s sang all the arias to me on the way.</span> <span id="s2146">It was a very romantic things.</span> <span id="s2147">He wanted to meet me again.</span> <span id="s2148">I made a date, but I didn’t go.</span></p> <p><span id="s2149">Q: Was that typical for you, that you would meet [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2150">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2151">I must say it was.</span> <span id="s2152">Because I -- how should I explain somebody that I don’t -- I was afraid then for questions and everything.</span> <span id="s2153">When I met new people, it was easy.</span> <span id="s2154">But people -- to meet people again is more difficult.</span> <span id="s2155">And then they may get doubt or ask question or a -- maybe -- may saf -- I knew in Vienna once, I was jaywalking again and somebody was on the bicycle and he sprang up and then he said, he said to me, “I have saved your life, now.”</span> <span id="s2156">Because -- because I was in front of the bicycle.</span> <span id="s2157">I wa -- I was walking in that way.</span> <span id="s2158">So he can accompa -- he can walk with me and accompany me, because he has saved my life.</span> <span id="s2159">So -- but I never allowed anybody to go with me as much as my cousin’s house, I never did that.</span> <span id="s2160">And he wanted to meet me again.</span> <span id="s2161">He -- he was talking against the German -- the Nazis.</span> <span id="s2162">Anyway -- and before he left me, he said, “If you denounce me, I say it’s all a lie, what you’ll say.”</span> <span id="s2163">But then he got afraid of it, I suppose and -- and he wanted to meet me again and -- and made me a date and he even gave me an amulet, a Christian amulet, what his mother has given him, so that it is -- that I see how much he wanted to meet me.</span> <span id="s2164">And I had this amulet for quite a time, I don’t know when I lost it.</span> <span id="s2165">And -- and -- but I didn’t go, of course.</span> <span id="s2166">I did not -- not meet him again.</span> <span id="s2167">This was a thing I -- I couldn’t do.</span></p> <p><span id="s2168">Q: You couldn’t take the chance?</span></p> <p><span id="s2169">A: No, couldn’t take a chance.</span></p> <p><span id="s2170">Q: So how did you meet Werner?</span></p> <p><span id="s2171">A: Werner?</span> <span id="s2172">In the -- in the -- in an art exhibition.</span> <span id="s2173">I was inclined for art.</span> <span id="s2174">I liked -- I like art.</span> <span id="s2175">And he was -- he -- he sat down beside me and started to talk and he wa -- he -- we went to the art exhibition again, he did know much more about art, what -- I found very attractive.</span> <span id="s2176">And we went toge -- and we went -- it was seven -- had another seven days holy day and we met every day, as I went.</span> <span id="s2177">We seem to Nimfemborg to Gamishbartenkieren to -- to the English garden and what -- what you see in -- in -- in --

<span id="s2180">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2181">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2182">Q: You don’t know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2183">A: I don’t know, I can’t tell -- can’t tell.</span> <span id="s2184">But some-something -- suppose I was charmed by something because I -- I went at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2185">Q: Now, did you tell him where you were living or you didn’t tell him, you simply met him in the city?</span></p> <p><span id="s2186">A: Oh, no -- yeah I met him in the city, always.</span> <span id="s2187">He didn’t take -- it didn’t go to desent -- there’s no -- but in the end I gave him a address.</span> <span id="s2188">He couldn’t -- otherwise he could not have written to me.</span> <span id="s2189">But ed -- I’d -- he didn’t ever go to Desenhoffen.</span></p> <p><span id="s2190">Q: Do you think you have instincts for who to trust and who not to trust?</span> <span id="s2191">Sounds like it, doesn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2192">A: No, I -- I -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2193">I -- as a -- I -- I didn’t -- I didn’t talk to anybody in all the Nazi time.</span> <span id="s2194">Only he -- only to him.</span> <span id="s2195">And this was because he wanted to marry me.</span> <span id="s2196">Otherwise I wouldn’t have told him either.</span></p> <p><span id="s2197">Q: So you spent a week seeing Werner every day?</span></p> <p><span id="s2198">A: With him, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2199">Q: And then he leaves?</span></p> <p><span id="s2200">A: Yeah, he had to leave --</span></p> <p><span

id="s2204">Q: And did you expect to hear from him or see him again, or you didn’t think about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2205">A: I -- I suppose we agreed to write to each other, or -- I don’t know if he -- I suppose he wrote, I am s-sure I didn’t write at first.</span> <span id="s2206">He wrote to me -- he send me a present.</span> <span id="s2207">He send me the -- the underkanter from -- from the sane, tha -- exists -- this is a replica of -- of a statuette.</span> <span id="s2208">The annon of the sane, as a -- somebody who was -- wh -- who died in the sane imperviasnat and he sent me of th-that.</span> <span id="s2209">It was a -- a little what I liked and we wrote to each other, but not much.</span> <span id="s2210">And so -- I didn’t write -- didn’t tell him about myself.</span> <span id="s2211">And I -- I suppose I wrote to him that I have enrolled at the -- at the Red Cross and I’m going to that -- to that place, I wrote to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2212">Q: And that was also a suggestion of Platner?</span> <span id="s2213">That you [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2214">A: This was after, when I was -- I had already the other people and he got to know me as Gretel Tanner.</span></p> <p><span id="s2215">Q: Werner did?</span> <span id="s2216">That you were Gretel --</span></p> <p><span id="s2217">A: Werner got to know re -- Gretel Tanner,

two trips -- you went, unannounced to Vienna, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2221">A: No -- yeah, because I went -- I’m -- I’m -- I went to Vienna after I had finished the Red Cross course.</span> <span id="s2222">I didn’t -- I have had to go because I hadn’t any winter clothes, it was beginning of November and I didn’t have a coat or anything.</span> <span id="s2223">I didn’t think I need that, I thought then it’s long finished, the Nazi time, until the winter.</span> <span id="s2224">I had only four or five summer dresses, I didn’t have anything else.</span> <span id="s2225">And I went -- I wanted to go for three days to Vienna and then I thought I can stay with my cousin for the three days, but I wasn’t very welcome.</span> <span id="s2226">This was -- I noticed it, that I wasn’t very welcome.</span> <span id="s2227">And -- as a -- I went to see Crystal, at Crystal’s I was always welcome and I went to see Mrs. Needelhile, but this was -- was .</span> <span id="s2228">I couldn’t stay there.</span> <span id="s2229">And so I decided to go home after two days.</span></p> <p><span id="s2230">Q: Did you see Peppy?</span></p> <p><span id="s2231">A: Yeah, of course I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s2232">Q: And you -- you weren’t welcome [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2233">A: I didn’t -- yeah, I was not welcome in -- in with his math -- mother, no.</span> <span id="s2234">And -- and as a -- I was a nu-nuisance, I’ve -- you knew -- you know when you are welcome or not.</span> <span id="s2235">I -- I’ve -- I had the feeling that this was my -- was not very nice to come to the friends and not to feel welcome, but I felt it at that time and I decided to go home after two days and not to stay three there -- another night in Vienna.</span> <span id="s2236">In Vienna, I always wore dark glasses.</span> <span id="s2237">Yes, this was my only one thing.</span> <span id="s2238">And I never wore the Red Cross uniform in Vienna, never -- didn’t -- this would give me away at once.</span> <span id="s2239">I never wore that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2240">Q: Why would it give you away?</span></p> <p><span id="s2241">A: No, be-because a Jew wasn’t allowed in the Red -- in the German Red Cross, you had to have an Aryan [indecipherable] this was not and I never wore that.</span> <span id="s2242">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s2243">Q: You also never wore the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2244">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s2245">Q: Red Cross broach.</span></p> <p><span id="s2246">A: No, they -- the Red Cross broach was worn in front -- only with the uniform.</span> <span id="s2247">But they were -- I never wore that because there was a little -- a swastika in the middle of the broach and I couldn’t go around with a swastika.</span></p> <p><span id="s2248">Q: And did that get you into trouble in the Red Cross?</span></p> <p><span id="s2249">A: I was ask -- of course, because the uniform wasn’t complete and as a -- said, “I’ve forgotten it, I’m sorry.”</span> <span id="s2250">Then I was always ask to join the women’s -- the -- the women’s organization for -- of the party.</span> <span id="s2251">I said yes, I ask where to go to and where to get the -- I got the address and go home -- went home and they are still waiting for me.</span> <span id="s2252">Yeah, and I -- as a -- and I was -- I ha -- now I would be among the party members, where -- if I had joined that organization, imagine.</span> <span id="s2253">No, as a -- I -- I -- this -- this -- it’s a passivity.</span> <span id="s2254">I was very pass -- I was a nobody.</span> <span id="s2255">And -- and Red Cross had a pa -- is a -- is a nobody.</span> <span id="s2256">I was a nobody and a pla -- I was satisfied with being a nobody, I didn’t want to shine and I was -- was -- I was a quiet nobody.</span> <span id="s2257">The nurses in the hospitals at that time, they were all going out with soldiers.</span> <span id="s2258">They were more interested in the soldiers than in the -- in then -- in the patients.</span> <span id="s2259">And -- but I was a nobody.</span></p> <p><span id="s2260">Q: So how -- you come back from Vienna and then do you hear from Werner soon after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2261">A: Yeah, there was a telegram there that he’s -- that he comes in the morning, on the same morning.</span> <span id="s2262">And, when I thought -- he has something in business or whatever.</span> <span id="s2263">Didn’t think of ma -- of myself, but I went to the station, I took off my hat, that he would recognize me.</span> <span id="s2264">And had now a winter coat and a hat and he arrived, he recognized me and we went -- an hour later, he had proposed marriage to me.</span> <span id="s2265">We went to a sh-shop where we could sit and at once he proposed marriage to me.</span> <span id="s2266">I thought -- this was a shock.</span> <span id="s2267">You can imagine.</span> <span id="s2268">Now he wanted -- as a -- I’d said yes, I love him, but you should not marry in -- you -- in war time and as all what you can say and what you can say -- I talked about it.</span> <span id="s2269">And -- but -- and in the end, I couldn’t get rid of him and he wanted --</span></p> <p><span id="s2270">Q: Had you fallen in love with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s2271">A: I don’t know -- as a -- I didn’t think of marrying at that time, believe me, I didn’t think of marrying.</span> <span id="s2272">But I was -- I -- as a -- I was in a desperate situation at that time.</span> <span id="s2273">But he was very, very pressing.</span> <span id="s2274">He wanted to meet my father, you know, I couldn’t -- I couldn’t produce a father.</span> <span id="s2275">And he was very, very -- he is very impulsive.</span> <span id="s2276">He was on the way to wor-work and just didn’t go to the works on -- to the -- a -- instead of going to araddo, he went to the station and came to Munich.</span> <span id="s2277">It suddenly came to him.</span> <span id="s2278">And so, in the end, that’s what I said to him.</span> <span id="s2279">And he had confessed -- confessed to me that he is in divorce and has a child and is in divorced proceedings.</span> <span id="s2280">He -- he had co-confessed that to me.</span> <span id="s2281">And then I said, I confess -- I said that I’m Jewish and live with somebody.</span> <span id="s2282">He said at once like this, “It doesn’t matter.”</span> <span id="s2283">This -- he said it is good that something is not right with me, as something is not right with him either.</span> <span id="s2284">He’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s2285">Q: But did you wonder that here he is -- was he in the -- was he a party member at this time, a Nazi party member?</span></p> <p><span id="s2286">A: Yeah, he was a part --</span></p> <p><span id="s2287">Q: He was.</span></p> <p><span id="s2288">Q: He had th-the -- in the -- in the label, he had sa -- he had the party badge on his -- in han -- on -- in -- ins -- on his suit.</span> <span id="s2289">He wore the party badge.</span></p> <p><span id="s2290">Q: So did you question him?</span> <span id="s2291">When he said it didn’t matter or that it was [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2292">A: No, I didn’t -- no, I -- no -- not -- he -- no, I didn’t question him.</span> <span id="s2293">When I was used -- that it doesn’t matter.</span> <span id="s2294">I met other Nazi, too.</span> <span id="s2295">But I -- he said it doesn’t matter, so it doesn’t matter, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2296">Q: So for you, the two of you were simply individuals at this moment?</span></p> <p><span id="s2297">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2298">Q: And the -- the political and the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2299">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2300">Q: -- horrible situation, was not there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2301">A: No, we -- yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s2302">And I -- but I said to him, positive I know that -- he should go back, I will wait for him, with -- after the war.</span> <span id="s2303">I love him, but he should go back and think it over.</span> <span id="s2304">Because he insisted that it doesn’t matter, when this is -- was a crime.</span> <span id="s2305">And -- and I -- but this, and I know I sh -- I should go to Brandenborg and think it over, I said to him.</span> <span id="s2306">Should go back.</span> <span id="s2307">And he went back in the evening of the same day and he wrote to me when -- then the worst thing is -- this is what you always -- he send me two or three telegrams I should come and I didn’t want to get telegrams.</span> <span id="s2308">This is not so easy.</span> <span id="s2309">And so I came.</span></p> <p><span id="s2310">Q: To Brandenborg?</span></p> <p><span id="s2311">A: On the 13th of December.</span> <span id="s2312">This was in November and on -- so a munch later already, I was on the way to Brandenborg.</span> <span id="s2313">On the 13th of December.</span> <span id="s2314">He arranged that I am staying with the wife of a friend of his.</span></p> <p><span id="s2315">Q: This is Hilda Shlagel?</span></p> <p><span id="s2316">A: Hilda Shlagel, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2317">Q: Did you -- during this month, say, I don’t think I should be doing this?</span> <span id="s2318">Or what am I doing, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s2319">A: No, I vor -- I -- I went be -- and -- I went because I -- he sent me telegrams.</span> <span id="s2320">I didn’t want to get telegrams.</span> <span id="s2321">I couldn’t s-say to him, “Stop se-sending telegrams, this is dangerous.”</span> <span id="s2322">I couldn’t do that.</span> <span id="s2323">And so this was a natural fi -- following that I went.</span></p> <p><span id="s2324">Q: No, what I mean is -- I un -- I understand you were trying to stop him from --</span></p> <p><span id="s2325">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2326">Q: -- putting you in danger.</span></p> <p><span id="s2327">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2328">Q: But now you were in another situation, where it appears you were taking a first step to saying yes, I will marry you.</span> <span id="s2329">And that --</span></p> <p><span id="s2330">A: Yeah, yeah, but it was a -- as a -- this was -- I -- I went -- I was staying with Hilda Shlagel -- hill -- and her husband was a soldier, wasn’t in -- wasn’t there and we were very good friends, very soon.</span> <span id="s2331">Hilda tell -- told me that they were all Nazis, [indecipherable], Hilda told me that she hadn’t tasted butter before Hitler came.</span> <span id="s2332">Her father was without work and she hadn’t tasted butter before Hitler came.</span> <span id="s2333">Sh-Sh-She told me.</span> <span id="s2334">And -- and her husband was wounded and was sent to a lautcerett in Metz.</span> <span id="s2335">Metz is in Emellsass.</span> <span id="s2336">And she went to him.</span> <span id="s2337">She had -- was six months -- six weeks in Ellsass, as -- as -- he’s -- and went out with him.</span> <span id="s2338">This was the nicest time of her life.</span> <span id="s2339">Was her first holiday and she had six weeks with her husband and because the women got a lot of money in the Nazi time.</span> <span id="s2340">When Werner was drafted, I got his full wages from the factory.</span> <span id="s2341">I didn’t even know before how much he earns.</span> <span id="s2342">And I got his full wages, automatically.</span> <span id="s2343">And -- and she had money, for the first time and had a -- a wonderful holiday in Metz.</span> <span id="s2344">He didn’t come back in the end.</span> <span id="s2345">He died in Roseland, but this was later and this was -- was forgi -- forget -- forgotten at that time, that it can happen.</span> <span id="s2346">The -- I -- I wondered sometimes, how easily it was -- the wo -- the women took the death of a soldier.</span> <span id="s2347">I couldn’t believe that.</span> <span id="s2348">They were -- at first they were written in -- in the announcement in Schtoltzatower, in -- as a -- in Schtoltzatower, how can I translate it?</span> <span id="s2349">I am proud -- proud -- I am sorry, but I am proud.</span> <span id="s2350">And then [indecipherable] stopped.</span> <span id="s2351">The English made once and -- and the English radio the ones how it stopped, as though -- how many there were the first years and how many the last years.</span> <span id="s2352">But they -- they -- I -- I didn’t know ma -- more women where the husband had died in the war and it was taken, to my -- from my feelings, too easily.</span> <span id="s2353">But they got all money and it may be that in -- in, “Machiavelli the Prince,” you know that book?</span> <span id="s2354">Yeah.</span> <span id="s2355">He writes that it is easier -- that it -- he writes definitely that people take -- as a -- easier the death of a person than the lo-lots of mon -- than the loss of money.</span> <span id="s2356">I don’t know if you have read it, but he is writing about it.</span> <span id="s2357">And I have found it is true.</span> <span id="s2358">There -- the s-soldiers asa -- died somewhere and then they got the note, but they got all money.</span> <span id="s2359">And -- and Hitler was generous with money.</span></p> <p><span id="s2360">Q: Did you feel any ambivalence, when you were living with Hilda Shlagel and thinking about being with Werner?</span></p> <p><span id="s2361">A: No, no, no, no, I -- no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2362">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s2363">A: Personally, we went on.</span> <span id="s2364">We went on, she -- every evening she went with me to Werner’s when he came home and we had a meal together usually and some talk and when we went home.</span> <span id="s2365">She went with us to Berlin for an exe -- for an -- for a trip and so no, I didn’t feel -- she was honest in her way, and I didn’t feel --</span></p> <p><span id="s2366">Q: But she didn’t know you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s2367">A: Of course she did not know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2368">Q: So -- obviously -- so if you had to always hide.</span></p> <p><span id="s2369">A: Yeah, I had to always.</span> <span id="s2370">Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2371">Q: That’s -- that’s not an easy situation to be in.</span></p> <p><span id="s2372">A: No, no, it -- a -- a -- I was not allowed to talk anything about my education, anything about my age.</span> <span id="s2373">I had to pretend that I am younger.</span> <span id="s2374">Werner sometimes, when we were in company, made -- made jokes about it, what only I understood.</span> <span id="s2375">And -- and he was -- no, it -- for me it was a life behind a screen.</span> <span id="s2376">It was not easy not to -- not -- but I found out, when you don’t talk, people don’t ask much.</span> <span id="s2377">I found out.</span> <span id="s2378">Usually people are talking more than they have to and they -- as a -- I had -- they were talking and I was listening.</span> <span id="s2379">In the hospital I had a patient, a Nazi industrialer, he was a private patient -- End of Tape Four, Side A Beginning Tape Four, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s2380">Q: -- but I found out, when you don’t talk, people don’t ask much.</span> <span id="s2381">I found out.</span> <span id="s2382">Usually people are talking more than they have to and they -- as a -- I had -- they were talking and I was listening.</span> <span id="s2383">In the hospital I had a patient, a Nazi industrialer, he was a private patient because he came to Brandenborg, because in Berlin were so many bombs.</span> <span id="s2384">So that he had a sto -- stroke and he came to Brandenborg in to so -- in -- into the hospital and I was -- happened to be the nurse.</span> <span id="s2385">And he liked to talk to me.</span> <span id="s2386">I was for him, the public opinion.</span> <span id="s2387">He met -- yeah, he wanted to ask sa -- as I was very careful, but once I gave myself -- he said, “Sister, you are clever.”</span> <span id="s2388">[indecipherable] I was shocked.</span> <span id="s2389">I was s -- i-i-it was -- for me it was terrible.</span> <span id="s2390">I was shocked, I was afraid I have given myself away.</span></p> <p><span id="s2391">Q: Because you were supposed to be a simple person.</span></p> <p><span id="s2392">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s2393">I was simple.</span> <span id="s2394">He said it once.</span> <span id="s2395">He wanted to take me as private nurse with him to Berlin, to Salandorf, where he was living.</span> <span id="s2396">I said, “It’s impossible, I’m a Red Cross nurse.”</span> <span id="s2397">He said he has enough connection to -- can do it.</span> <span id="s2398">But then I got married, no?</span> <span id="s2399">And he insisted that his sons send me moselwine.</span> <span id="s2400">This was like gold at that time.</span> <span id="s2401">And I -- so I got moselwine for my wedding, yeah.</span> <span id="s2402">He was -- he got flowers from Spier, net -- who was at that time in -- in -- in the government.</span> <span id="s2403">Yeah, he got flowers from them.</span> <span id="s2404">This was my compady.</span></p> <p><span id="s2405">Q: Edith, do you think that you -- you partly married Werner for protection, as well as for feelings, or did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2406">A: No, I -- I -- look, you have to understood, I felt jilted from th -- from Peppy.</span> <span id="s2407">I felt that he did not -- he di -- hasn’t behaved properly to me.</span> <span id="s2408">When I wrote him about Werner, he suddenly said think of your mo -- no, I should not marry and all arguments you can bring.</span> <span id="s2409">“What would your mother say?”</span> <span id="s2410">And think of that and -- and everything.</span> <span id="s2411">And he had time before.</span> <span id="s2412">Enough time, years and years and years.</span> <span id="s2413">He had time before.</span> <span id="s2414">And there comes somebody who doesn’t know anything of me -- of me.</span> <span id="s2415">He doesn’t know -- he -- he even knows I have a wrong name and wants me.</span> <span id="s2416">No, so it was a -- an natural reaction.</span> <span id="s2417">I felt definitely -- and I had made up, when I went to Munich, that I will never marry Peppy and that I felt jilted.</span> <span id="s2418">He did.</span> <span id="s2419">Because, for his comfort I had stayed and -- and now he has gone on a comfortable life in hi -- with his mother, but h -- I was not included.</span> <span id="s2420">I -- not even slept one night in that hou -- in that flat.</span> <span id="s2421">So I felt -- I felt jilted.</span> <span id="s2422">I felt he -- he didn’t behave properly and honestly to me.</span> <span id="s2423">And here comes somebody, sent from heaven, who hasn’t know me, doesn’t know anything of me and knows only that I -- that it is a crime to -- to marry me and he wants me.</span> <span id="s2424">So I -- I didn’t think so much of protection or something.</span> <span id="s2425">Someone -- I really wanted to share my life with him.</span> <span id="s2426">It was a protection, but it was not in front -- it was not as a -- for me it was not the -- the reason to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2427">Q: That’s what it seemed in your -- in the way in which your letters worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s2428">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2429">Q: That the anger against Peppy worked to even enhance the emotions with Werner.</span></p> <p><span id="s2430">A: Yes, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s2431">Q: Werner finally gets a divorce?</span></p> <p><span id="s2432">A: Yeah, end of January he got the divorce and then I moved into his flat, but I didn’t want to get married, not before -- I was afraid of the bureaucracy and all that.</span> <span id="s2433">We -- we lived very happily.</span></p> <p><span id="s2434">Q: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2435">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2436">When I was working and he wasn’t working, he made cutoffer poofa as o -- and -- and he was cooking and when he had an hour free, he came to the hospital, when I was working and in the time where I had the break or something, he came to the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s2437">Q: So he was very devoted to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2438">A: Yeah, he was.</span> <span id="s2439">When he was drafted, in -- in ‘44, he was in a -- in a casairner, this is a military establishment in Brandenborg.</span> <span id="s2440">He came ever --every evening home.</span> <span id="s2441">Every evening and it was forbidden to go out for the soldiers.</span> <span id="s2442">He came on his bike.</span> <span id="s2443">At midnight he had to be there, he had a -- a special way to come back into -- into this establishment and once he came down and a piece of his bicycle was stolen and he got a shock.</span> <span id="s2444">He stole the same piece from another bicycle and put it quickly on his bicycle and so that he is back, yeah.</span> <span id="s2445">It was some -- I -- I sa -- I don’t know a bicycle, but he had a shock that something was stolen from the bike.</span> <span id="s2446">No, but he came home every evening.</span></p> <p><span id="s2447">Q: Do you think that he knew what was happening to Jews and did you know what was happening to Jews in Poland at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s2448">A: No, I don’t think that he did know.</span> <span id="s2449">We didn’t talk about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2450">Q: You didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s2451">A: No, not -- not at all, not a bit.</span> <span id="s2452">I don’t think that he did know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2453">Q: And was he ever nervous about being caught having married you and protecting you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2454">A: I don’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s2455">Q: Or [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2456">A: I can’t say.</span> <span id="s2457">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2458">Q: You don’t know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2459">A: Maybe.</span> <span id="s2460">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2461">We didn’t talk about it, it was -- I -- I didn’t -- when I was afraid, I didn’t say -- I didn’t speak about it.</span> <span id="s2462">I was afraid as often as I entered a restaurant or something, because people were going around so much in the war.</span> <span id="s2463">But I -- we didn’t ta-talk about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2464">Q: So how did you get the marriage papers, since you couldn’t produce anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s2465">A: The marriage, as o -- I -- I had -- Peppy had, actually -- for the Red Cross, I did already, in -- prove that I am Aryan, I did it.</span> <span id="s2466">And, at that time, I have learned by heart my -- my grandparents and so forth, so -- so well, that when I came to that establishment, it was a lady in a -- in a palace or something and I enrolled for the Red Cross, she made a remark that it’s exceptionally how well I am a -- how well I know my grandparents, because she made a remark about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2467">Q: So that was dangerous.</span></p> <p><span id="s2468">A: Yeah, yes.</span> <span id="s2469">It is such [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2470">And so I had these papers, I had these papers, what he -- and now, as a -- when I went to -- to the register office, I -- I only went because I was pregnant and I wanted to preg a -- pregnant, I wanted a baby and he didn’t want -- I did -- I wanted an illegitimate baby, because I didn’t want to get married, but he found that he doesn’t want to be a father of an illegitimate baby.</span> <span id="s2471">Maybe the membership of the Nazi party or something, and so he -- he insisted we must get married.</span> <span id="s2472">And you -- he was not so afraid.</span> <span id="s2473">I was more afraid, but I sis -- and took my papers and went to the register office and he looked at my papers and said, “You haven’t any papers from your mother.”</span> <span id="s2474">And becau -- I said, “Yes, my mother was from white Russia and I could not get any papers from Russia now, in -- during the war.</span> <span id="s2475">He said, “Yeah, but she could have been a Jew.”</span> <span id="s2476">Imagine.</span> <span id="s2477">And I was standing there, then he dropped everything and he looked interesting in my face -- face.</span> <span id="s2478">I was sitting -- when you see it, he was in front of the desk and I was sitting on this side.</span> <span id="s2479">And he dropped everything.</span> <span id="s2480">I don’t know how -- I -- I can’t tell you how long he looked at my face and then he said, “It is to see that your mother wasn’t Jewish.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2481">Q: It’s what?</span> <span id="s2482">It’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s2483">A: It is to see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2484">Q: Ah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2485">A: Asum, this offenbyclar that my mother wasn’t Jew -- my father was Jewish too -- and -- and that my mother wasn’t Jewish and I could get married.</span> <span id="s2486">When I think of that, in the middle of Nazi Germany -- when I went home, I was laughing all the time.</span> <span id="s2487">I couldn’t -- he says, you -- you get --</span></p> <p><span id="s2488">Q: Was Werner with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2489">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2490">Q: So you were alone when you were with this man?</span></p> <p><span id="s2491">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2492">And I didn’t tell him about this, no, no.</span> <span id="s2493">I said we can get married.</span> <span id="s2494">I didn’t tell him about that, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2495">Q: All right, let’s take a break.</span></p> <p><span id="s2496">End of Tape Four, Side B Beginning Tape Five, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s2497">Q: Edith, when we took a break the last time, you were talking about going to the registry -- the registrar -- about getting married.</span></p> <p><span id="s2498">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2499">Q: So you were convinced by Werner to get married at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s2500">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2501">I -- I -- we -- we got married and I was very nervous at the wedding.</span> <span id="s2502">I don't know anything about the wedding, I was so afraid I’d sign unconsciously, the wrong name.</span> <span id="s2503">I had to sign my real, Christina Maria Marguerita Denner and was so afraid, that I don’t know anything.</span> <span id="s2504">Hilda Shlagel and her husband were my witnesses and -- now afterwards, we had a meal and nothing else.</span></p> <p><span id="s2505">Q: So just the four of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2506">A: Yes, of the four -- there were no other guests or anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s2507">Q: And how many months pregnant were you by then?</span></p> <p><span id="s2508">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s2509">Q: How many months pregnant were you?</span> <span id="s2510">S-Six months?</span></p> <p><span id="s2511">A: Noth -- yeah, about -- as a -- this was

told me I can’t have a child because of my heart condition, in Vienna, when I was 16.</span> <span id="s2514">I had forgotten about it and -- but I had to take pills for the heart during my pregnancy.</span> <span id="s2515">I had to take pills.</span></p> <p><span id="s2516">Q: So did that heart condition affect you when you were working?</span> <span id="s2517">It didn’t, did it?</span> <span id="s2518">In the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s2519">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2520">I had to work.</span> <span id="s2521">Nobody ask if I have a condi -- heart condition or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s2522">Q: So, how was it after you got married to Werner?</span> <span id="s2523">Things were fine?</span></p> <p><span id="s2524">A: Things were fine, yes.</span> <span id="s2525">When I was pregnant, I could s-stay home, then.</span> <span id="s2526">As soon as it was -- I never went to a doctor any more and -- and I had no -- no doctor there, I wa -- felt fine.</span> <span id="s2527">It was a hap -- a happy time in a way.</span> <span id="s2528">I was waiting for her and I didn’t work and was only at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s2529">Q: So you stopped working after the Red Cross went --</span></p> <p><span id="s2530">A: Yeah, est -- yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2531">Q: Before you got -- before you got married?</span> <span id="s2532">Or after?</span></p> <p><span id="s2533">A: No, when I got married, I was still working.</span> <span id="s2534">I -- I had only one day off.</span> <span id="s2535">I had - -and -- and I was still working, but soon afterwards, I was -- it was -- I stopped.</span></p> <p><span id="s2536">Q: So you had wanted a child for a long time, I gather?</span></p> <p><span id="s2537">A: Yeah, I wanted.</span> <span id="s2538">Yeah, I wanted her, because I had so many be -- I was already 29 years old and I’m af -- was afraid I’m getting too old for it.</span> <span id="s2539">And I was -- I wanted yeah -- f-five or six or something.</span> <span id="s2540">And I wanted to start.</span> <span id="s2541">And I was -- of -- of course I wanted her.</span></p> <p><span id="s2542">Q: So, you didn’t have a doctor.</span> <span id="s2543">So what happened the evening that you felt your labor pains?</span> <span id="s2544">You -- you said you played chess?</span></p> <p><span id="s2545">A: Oh, he -- he -- he took the lexicon -- the convers -- co -- what you have and looked it up, what you have when you have a labor pain and ask me if I have that and that and that -- what was written in -- in -- in the lexicon.</span> <span id="s2546">And I always said, “No, no.”</span> <span id="s2547">I didn’t know that wa -- at -- I said, “I don’t know, I don’t know.”</span> <span id="s2548">But at -- at midnight and I went -- but it -- there was no -- no carriage or anything.</span> <span id="s2549">I had to go -- to walk, more than half an hour, to -- to the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s2550">Q: You walked?</span></p> <p><span id="s2551">A: Walked.</span> <span id="s2552">No, there was no carriage or anything -- in that -- in the dark town.</span> <span id="s2553">Because it was all dark.</span> <span id="s2554">And -- and in the morning, she was born.</span></p> <p><span id="s2555">Q: But you said you were walking around half the night before you told Werner that you had --</span></p> <p><span id="s2556">A: Yeah, maybe -- up to midnight.</span></p> <p><span id="s2557">Q: Why?</span> <span id="s2558">Why did you wait so long?</span></p> <p><span id="s2559">A: I don’t know -- I -- I didn’t know, I can’t tell you that, but it -- but at midnight I woke him up and then he came with the conversationes lexicon and -- and told me -- ask me, I feel that -- I feel that -- I feel that and I said, “I don’t know.”</span> <span id="s2560">And I -- it was my first child, I didn’t know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2561">Q: So your daughter was born, and what did you name her?</span></p> <p><span id="s2562">A: I’m -- I’m -- Maria Ange -- Maria after Maria Needelhile, because without her, she wouldn’t have been born and Angelica was his choice.</span> <span id="s2563">Angelica Kaufman was a painter -- a painter.</span> <span id="s2564">And she was wa -- he was -- she was one of the founder of the Royal Academy in England.</span> <span id="s2565">But -- was very well known painter.</span> <span id="s2566">And he wanted that she should be a painter, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2567">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2568">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2569">And this -- as is -- this happened, she is a painter.</span></p> <p><span id="s2570">Q: And did he not make the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2571">A: Yeah, he made all -- every one, he -- he made himself.</span> <span id="s2572">This what is here -- he was -- was sent to Peppy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2573">Q: So it’s in the Holocaust Museum collection?</span></p> <p><span id="s2574">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2575">This was sent to Peppy, this -- and -- but all others he -- he made himself, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2576">Q: And he had met Peppy --</span></p> <p><span id="s2577">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2578">Q: -- before the birth of --</span></p> <p><span id="s2579">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s2580">He met -- he has met her -- he met him in Vienna.</span> <span id="s2581">And he hel -- had helped him to a document, to --</span></p> <p><span id="s2582">Q: What was that meeting like, between -- nothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s2583">A: No, they were quite normal, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2584">Q: So, was having a baby everything that you wished, when you saw this beautiful child?</span></p> <p><span id="s2585">A: Yeah, this was now my -- yes, she was -- she was a nice baby.</span> <span id="s2586">She was very good and she was a -- people came to me and ask me h-how to bring up a baby, as if I were -- because she was such a good baby.</span> <span id="s2587">Can’t believe it.</span> <span id="s2588">Above me, there was a woman, a -- a couple living, they wanted to adopt a child, but they were no Nazis, so they didn’t get a child to -- for adoption, uh?</span> <span id="s2589">And sh -- after Angela was about three months old, she came back with a baby, she had a baby.</span> <span id="s2590">And this -- as a -- sh -- they were -- they are very devoted to the baby.</span> <span id="s2591">As I have heard later on, the father was a French prisoner and the mother was a German girl.</span> <span id="s2592">And when our house was burned out in -- after the war, I was in office in the court, she came to me and she said to me, how long to -- does she have to pr -- go to prison when it comes out, then?</span> <span id="s2593">She had given her this child, and it -- in another town, where she went, she gave different name, as a -- she said it is her child, it wasn’t hers.</span> <span id="s2594">Because the Russians have all these mixed children from prisoners, have all taking away.</span> <span id="s2595">People who had children, who were already two or three years old, the Russian collected all children and took all children away.</span> <span id="s2596">And she had pretended that it is her child and now she came to me and ask me how long she’s -- she would have to go to prison when it comes out.</span> <span id="s2597">And she said to me, “They can take everything what I have, again, but not this child.”</span> <span id="s2598">Now she must be about -- over 50.</span> <span id="s2599">I hope it never came out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2600">Q: And how was Werner with the child?</span></p> <p><span id="s2601">A: No, it a -- he was -- at that time, it -- he was not so interested in ba -- he had ya -- had already a child and he didn’t take a s-special interest in her.</span></p> <p><span id="s2602">Q: Was he disappointed that it wasn’t a boy?</span></p> <p><span id="s2603">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2604">He was in -- disappointed, he wanted -- because he had a girl.</span> <span id="s2605">He loved his girl, and he wrote to her and -- but he was disappointed.</span> <span id="s2606">He wanted a boy and he -- he -- the boy should be named Klaus.</span> <span id="s2607">But it wasn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s2608">Q: Did you meet his other child?</span></p> <p><span id="s2609">A: Yeah, she wa -- came to me ev -- holiday.</span></p> <p><span id="s2610">Q: And what was --</span></p> <p><span id="s2611">A: She was six months in my hou -- six weeks in my house.</span> <span id="s2612">Yes, she came to me and -- and we -- at the age of four.</span></p> <p><span id="s2613">Q: And what was she like?</span></p> <p><span id="s2614">A: She -- she had -- as it happened, a club foot.</span> <span id="s2615">Do you know what that is?</span> <span id="s2616">Because her grandfather had too, and it was in the family, it run in the family.</span> <span id="s2617">And she had an operation at that time.</span> <span id="s2618">And she had to wear special sh-sheens and shoes at that time and she came.</span> <span id="s2619">Now she -- now I know -- I have met her after the war and she said -- sh-she tells -- her feet -- her legs are not quite the same and she says she had the -- a bicycle accident, to explain it.</span> <span id="s2620">She said -- but she said, if -- should one of her sons -- they had two sons, marry a girl she doesn’t like, then she will tell her about the -- the -- about the illness which is inherited, she said.</span> <span id="s2621">But she pretends she had an bicycle accident.</span> <span id="s2622">She’s very tall, not like my daughter.</span> <span id="s2623">She’s very, very tall, h-her mother was tall and she -- she was so tall that her sons didn’t want to go out with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s2624">Q: Was -- I thought I remembered you telling me that -- that she walked around and said, “Heil Hitler,” and one day [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2625">A: Yeah, wh -- yes, that -- she was -- her mother wa -- she -- she -- she went into my flat and noticed that I haven’t got the Hitler bild.</span> <span id="s2626">And she told me after the war, because I were -- I was talking, I told her that.</span> <span id="s2627">We met in London, she was living in London and I told her and she’s -- she said she was all -- going on, saying “Heil Hitler” to everybody, until her mother smacked her so hard that she stops making -- that she stops saying “Heil Hitler.”</span> <span id="s2628">Her mother must have been a great Nazi, that she brought up the child in that way, when she was only four years old and saying -- what can you expect when you are taught to say “Heil Hitler” to everybody?</span> <span id="s2629">Actually, when I was at court, Brandenborg, they -- in Brandenborg there was nothing burned or anything.</span> <span id="s2630">All the files were there.</span> <span id="s2631">And when I got files, the Germans had not on written “Heil Hitler”, this was normal.</span> <span id="s2632">Many wrote underneath, “Gott -- Gott strafa England.”</span> <span id="s2633">God punish England, on the end of -- of a -- wa -- wa -- of an appellation it was to the court, of an -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2634">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2635">A: I have seen it with my -- and then they were standing for me and told me that they were never Nazis.</span> <span id="s2636">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2637">Q: Now, did -- did -- Werner’s other daughter --</span></p> <p><span id="s2638">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s2639">Q: Go to her father and say, “Where is Hitler on the -- on the wall?</span> <span id="s2640">Why isn’t -- why isn’t there a picture?”</span> <span id="s2641">Or she didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s2642">A: No, she wa -- he was roundabout and she was li -- when she was used, I suppose, in every house to see a Hitler picture.</span> <span id="s2643">I didn’t go into it, what she said, I didn’t go into it.</span> <span id="s2644">And she had to live without the Hitler picture in my house.</span></p> <p><span id="s2645">Q: So tell me, did you have some sort of a -- a -- since now you were married, social engagements with colleagues of Werner, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s2646">A: No, at -- no, he hadn’t much -- many friends.</span> <span id="s2647">He hadn’t many -- many friends, no.</span> <span id="s2648">He wasn’t -- he hadn’t many friends, no.</span> <span id="s2649">I had -- nos -- not a special social life.</span> <span id="s2650">I was with Hilda Shlagel and -- but I -- I can’t remember if was somebody else, not --</span></p> <p><span id="s2651">Q: That was helpful to you not to have any social life.</span></p> <p><span id="s2652">A: Yes, I didn’t -- I didn’t look for a social li -- I -- I had a good relationship to everybody who lived in the house and I had -- and after the war I was -- I met -- happened a neighbor and we kept together, but I had no -- no social life in that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s2653">Q: Was it difficult for you to be a mother?</span> <span id="s2654">You had never been a mother and you hadn’t watched anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s2655">A: No, I have seen in -- in the hospital.</span> <span id="s2656">I was a nurse.</span></p> <p><span id="s2657">Q: Ah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2658">A: In -- in the maternity ward.</span> <span id="s2659">No, it was not difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s2660">Q: I had forgotten that you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s2661">A: Yeah, I was -- I knew -- this was not -- I did know about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2662">Q: But they took you away from some -- you were doing a certain job and then you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2663">A: No, I wa -- before I was -- it was in other wor -- wards.</span> <span id="s2664">But this was my last one, the maternity ward, because I was not allowed to work with foreigners any more, I was too friendly to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2665">Q: So the maternity ward was helpful to you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2666">A: Was fo --</span></p> <p><span id="s2667">Q: -- because then you learned a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s2668">A: Yes, I learned a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s2669">Q: So, you lived with Werner then for what?</span> <span id="s2670">A year and a -- you were married for a year and a half and then he was drafted?</span></p> <p><span id="s2671">A: He was drafted on the third of se -- first of September, ‘44, but two days later he went there.</span> <span id="s2672">H-He -- no -- no he -- he -- he was supposed to go on the first, but after two days he didn’t dare to stay away any more.</span> <span id="s2673">Af -- he went there on the third and then he was in Brandenborg and he was sent to F-Frankfurt on the Order, before Christmas and he wanted me to -- to come to Christmas and I came.</span> <span id="s2674">And -- and Hilda Shlagel looked after Angela for four days and I -- I went to him -- to -- to Frankfurt, this was a new year -- new year after Christmas, ‘45, in Frankfurt on the Order.</span></p> <p><span id="s2675">Q: And then he was -- went to the front?</span></p> <p><span id="s2676">A: Then he was -- I -- I -- I didn’t see him and he was -- then became a Russian prisoner in Kustrene.</span></p> <p><span id="s2677">Q: And so he was a prisoner for two years?</span></p> <p><span id="s2678">A: For two years.</span> <span id="s2679">In Sib-Siberia.</span> <span id="s2680">This is where he sent me that letter, from Siberia.</span></p> <p><span id="s2681">Q: That’s -- that’s hidden in the -- that was hidden in the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2682">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2683">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2684">Q: Was that a difficult period for you now, for two years you were alone with your daughter?</span> <span id="s2685">You had money, because you were getting a salary.</span></p> <p><span id="s2686">A: I get the salary, yes.</span> <span id="s2687">We -- we couldn’t buy much on -- for the salary and I -- what I saved on money, he had taken all our money with him.</span> <span id="s2688">Yes, we had -- what we had saved and he told me that he throw away 10,000 marks because he was afraid the Russians would take him for a Capitalist.</span> <span id="s2689">He throw it away.</span></p> <p><span id="s2690">Q: But why did he take the money?</span> <span id="s2691">He was going --</span></p> <p><span id="s2692">A: Yeah, he wa -- he thought he may have to buy something as a -- he felt better and I left him at -- when I -- I didn’t care for money at all and I had -- what I saved this half year I was alone, I took out before the Russians came -- out of the bank.</span> <span id="s2693">And I said to Hilda Shlagel she should take her money out of the bank, too, but she was afraid, she has too money -- much money in the house and she didn’t.</span> <span id="s2694">And she lost everything.</span> <span id="s2695">And I -- because, when the Russians came, they opened the banks, they throw the me -- money about.</span> <span id="s2696">And -- but I had -- and I did need it, I had the savings from the six months, I had with me.</span> <span

whooping cough and I was afraid more of whooping cough than of the ba -- bombs.</span> <span id="s2709">I was afraid of whooping cough.</span> <span id="s2710">And I was standing with the blanket in my hand, near the coat, so th -- I have to run.</span> <span id="s2711">And -- but it’s -- only on the end there were bombs.</span> <span id="s2712">Because they flew every day over.</span> <span id="s2713">And they said on the wireless, they are in unf -- they are unfluke -- how do you tell [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2714">An unfluke of Brandenborg, as a -- they are flying to

only BBC, I got barominster, this was Switzerland and Voice of America, this I got too.</span> <span id="s2726">And I got the Russian, too, but I didn’t -- they started always, “Death to the occupants.”</span> <span id="s2727">This was their beginning.</span> <span id="s2728">And I think the Russians were not -- not what I expected, I found that -- not what -- I -- I -- BBC, on BBC I heard Rosh Hashonah.</span> <span id="s2729">The -- the chief rabbi of England -- this was an experience, I tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2730">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2731">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2732">He -- he -- Brody, I think was his name at that time and he spoke.</span> <span id="s2733">My tears were running down and he -- this was a very touching experience, to

were more afraid -- I wasn’t afraid of the Russian.</span> <span id="s2753">They were more afraid than the Germans, they were -- of the Russians.</span> <span id="s2754">And they came into the flats -- not in front of it.</span> <span id="s2755">And then the SS came and with pis -- and with the pistol in the hands, they force him to go out again.</span> <span id="s2756">But in the end they took these people away and -- and then there was -- so we were in the cellar or everywhere -- everywhere and I think I was the only one who was asleep, because I was not so afraid as the others -- the others.</span> <span id="s2757">They told us -- I didn’t believe all the propaganda, even what we sa -- what was true, I didn’t believe any word the Nazis said of all the rapes and all, I didn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s2758">And then it -- I was in the -- in the house and the artillery -- the Russian artillery, shot aw-away the ha -- the roof.</span> <span id="s2759">And in the end, German soldiers came in -- this was in the night already and said we all have to go out and have to run away.</span> <span id="s2760">Then I put my baby into the pram and ran with the others, because -- and the -- the -- the bridges were already prepared for -- for blasting -- for explosion.</span> <span id="s2761">And this was the last what I have seen of my house and then I was running and in the end I ended up in a barn somewhere, I don’t know which -- which [indecipherable] and I noticed that my daughter has measles.</span> <span id="s2762">We’re -- I was going from house to house and ask they should a ill child let into a house, nobody let me.</span> <span id="s2763">Nobody let me in.</span> <span id="s2764">And in the end, this was a very small house, there were two women living and they let me in.</span> <span id="s2765">And then I was with them, I was sleeping -- the child was in the pram -- at least they could make it dark, because with measles you shouldn’t have sunlight.</span> <span id="s2766">No, and a doctor was not to think of.</span> <span id="s2767">A-And -- and then Russian soldiers were all streaming in -- everybody had a white -- a -- a -- a white flag already and everybody -- and they were streaming and they came to that house too and I made pancakes for them.</span> <span id="s2768">They found some eggs somewhere and they had a -- the-there were no electricity any more, but they had a battery.</span> <span id="s2769">They heard the last speech of they -- Dernis, who was the follow of Hitler at that time and he said that people should follow the -- the rules of the -- of the allyearten, and Germany is like a ship which has lost his direction.</span> <span id="s2770">He’s -- this I do remember and -- and then the German soldiers went to the east and -- and at that time, I -- I started to -- not to talk too friendly of the Nazis, I suppose and the soldier took me away and said that it’s still dangerous, I shouldn’t talk in such way.</span> <span id="s2771">As a -- a friendly soldier, and he warned me --</span></p> <p><span id="s2772">Q: This was a German?</span></p> <p><span id="s2773">A: It was a German.</span> <span id="s2774">He warned me from the Germans.</span> <span id="s2775">So I sa -- I shut up.</span> <span id="s2776">And they went away to the west.</span> <span id="s2777">They wanted to take me with them, actually, but I couldn’t go with a ill child and then there was nobody there and these two women went on her -- their bra -- on -- on their bicycles and went away, I was alone.</span> <span id="s2778">Didn’t want to receive -- to be alone, so I went to Brandenborg back with the baby.</span> <span id="s2779">I met the first Russian soldiers in the wood, they didn’t look at me and I didn’t look at them.</span> <span id="s2780">And I must say, I was never touched and never raped by a soldier.</span> <span id="s2781">I was -- I had a watch even, on my -- my -- on my wrist and it was not taken from me.</span> <span id="s2782">As -- I was lucky again.</span> <span id="s2783">And then I went into Brandenborg and here I had the worst experience of my life.</span> <span id="s2784">There we -- the way to -- into Brandenborg was over a deep, deep ditch and this -- the bridge over it was -- was bla -- exploded.</span> <span id="s2785">There was a hole in the middle and this hole was filled with the door -- with a -- a lavatory door, with a heart cut out.</span> <span id="s2786">And I had to walk over this door -- over this ditch with the pram.</span> <span id="s2787">This is an experience what still was -- I -- I still cannot see any height or anything.</span> <span id="s2788">This was a -- a terrible strain on me and I could --</span></p> <p><span id="s2789">Q: And how deep -- it was a deep ditch?</span></p> <p><span id="s2790">A: Yeah, the -- very deep.</span> <span id="s2791">Very, very deep.</span> <span id="s2792">Some -- somebody told me it’s filled out now and very deep ditch.</span> <span id="s2793">Not only -- as it would be death.</span> <span id="s2794">And -- and then I went to the place where I lived -- where I had been living, the house was burned out and in the cellar there was a small suitcase where my real document was.</span> <span id="s2795">And I wanted to get to that.</span> <span id="s2796">And it was so hot still, that I couldn’t go in.</span> <span id="s2797">I -- and a Russian soldier noticed that, that I tried and he went -- as I couldn’t speak, he went in for me and too -- and took out this suitcase for me.</span> <span id="s2798">He could -- and so he was -- he noticed that I am fighting with the heat, because we were lying -- they had taken out of the rest of the houses, the mattresses, put it there and they were lying about and so I -- and in this suitcase was a book, where in the book was my -- my exam paper of law and my identity card.</span></p> <p><span id="s2799">Q: The real one?</span></p> <p><span id="s2800">A: The real one.</span> <span id="s2801">This was built in between -- Peppy had done it for me -- between the covers.</span> <span id="s2802">As o -- then I had that book and then I met a neighbor and we kept together.</span> <span id="s2803">We see -- she was -- had a pram too, and was pregnant and had a -- a baby in a pram.</span> <span id="s2804">And we met -- we didn’t know where to go and we met our doctor.</span> <span id="s2805">The -- the baby -- the children’s doctor and she told us to go to a home of -- of chil -- a children’s home, a Protestant children’s home was there and so she knows that and we should go there.</span> <span id="s2806">We went there and they took us in and we were of twos -- what you have -- this were -- how do you call that in English?</span> <span id="s2807">When you have somebody ill and you put the bed o-on -- it was not a normal bed, it was just such -- for an -- for emergency.</span> <span id="s2808">And this too, they put in -- in the room behind the stage and we laid down -- were lying down there and the children were in the pram.</span> <span id="s2809">And in the night -- and so I didn’t think of -- of locking the door or anything and in the night drunk Russian soldiers came in and all the rooms where the lock was, they -- and they went -- they opened the door, but as it wasn’t closed, it wasn’t important.</span> <span id="s2810">When it were closed, they would have broken in.</span> <span id="s2811">But as it wasn’t closed, it -- the door went and -- I saw -- up and down and was moving.</span> <span id="s2812">And we were holding hands all the night, until the Russian soldi -- until it was quiet.</span> <span id="s2813">This was our night there.</span> <span id="s2814">And then we decided not a second night in that place and we went away.</span> <span id="s2815">And we went in the flat which was empty, where the people had run away.</span> <span id="s2816">The doors didn’t close and the win -- windows didn’t close, but this ul -- small things we didn’t mind.</span> <span id="s2817">And we were -- and we had no water, no gas, no electricity.</span> <span id="s2818">I had to go for every drop of water, to a hydrant in the street somewhere away.</span> <span id="s2819">And there we managed somewhere to survive.</span> <span id="s2820">I don’t know what we ate at that time.</span> <span id="s2821">There was no food at [inaudible] on top of it.</span> <span id="s2822">And she got in contact with her mother and may -- and moved to her mother and I was staying on in that flat until the people came back who were living there.</span> <span id="s2823">And we got -- they were very thankful because I hadn’t stolen anything.</span> <span id="s2824">There was all intact the house, even their watches and everything and I me -- ha -- they were very thankful that nothing was stolen.</span> <span id="s2825">And I lived then with that people for a month.</span> <span id="s2826">I was very friendly with their daughter and with the woman had a gruder, because -- I don’t know if you know that -- this is a -- an oven, what in Germany, it is -- this is a long -- an oven where they have coke.</span> <span id="s2827">And this is glowing.</span> <span id="s2828">And you -- to -- to cook something there, you need hours.</span> <span id="s2829">But the woman who -- of the house, she didn’t want me in the kitchen, she did all the cooking for me and did everything.</span> <span id="s2830">She didn’t want -- she didn’t want to be disturbed, was an elderly woman there, was good, we sat up in there.</span> <span id="s2831">I’ve -- had been living for months with them.</span> <span id="s2832">And sometimes they gave me an egg -- egg or something for the baby.</span> <span id="s2833">And then I moved into a-an empty house, where the people had run away.</span> <span id="s2834">This was not directly in Brandenborg, it was in a suburb of Brandenborg, in the -- on the gerdin.</span> <span id="s2835">And he -- I was living there and then in -- in September, half a year after the war, I applied for a job at the court.</span> <span id="s2836">They were very glad to see me and to receive me.</span> <span id="s2837">And because the Russians didn’t allow Nazi to be judges or something.</span> <span id="s2838">And then I was living in that house for quite a time and then the people came back.</span> <span id="s2839">And according to th -- how it was at that time, I could have stayed in the house, but I didn’t want -- I didn’t forget what happened to us.</span> <span id="s2840">I -- I moved out of the house, left everything.</span> <span id="s2841">And I couldn’t -- I -- I -- I couldn’t be with Angela at once, and Angela went to the people -- to a woman -- to a couple who was -- was looking after her when I was working then.</span> <span id="s2842">And I was working in -- was living in a room in th -- in the courthouse and there was with the people who were looking after the house, I was living with them.</span> <span id="s2843">So it was about two months until I got the fred what I had then.</span> <span id="s2844">And what I managed that -- to have.</span> <span id="s2845">And then, after a time -- and so it was empty, but people helped me to furnish it.</span> <span id="s2846">It was very nicely furnished already.</span> <span id="s2847">And then I --</span></p> <p><span id="s2848">Q: Can you tell me about your work?</span></p> <p><span id="s2849">A: Huh?</span> <span id="s2850">I was working all the time in that time.</span> <span id="s2851">From I -- I worked from September ‘45, I worked as a -- at the court.</span></p> <p><span id="s2852">Q: Even without a law degree?</span></p> <p><span id="s2853">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s2854">Q: Even without the degree?</span></p> <p><span id="s2855">A: I had -- I had -- according to German law, I had a better degree than in Austria.</span> <span id="s2856">Because they didn’t ask the -- what we call the third examination.</span> <span id="s2857">They didn’t ask for -- to -- to make an examination economy and inshta -- in -- in -- state in Constitutions and -- this was not asking in Germany.</span> <span id="s2858">And af-after German law, they had to a -- a -- to adjust the Aus -- after the Anschluss, they had to adjust the Austrian study and the German study.</span> <span id="s2859">And I was better qualified -- qualified in Germany than in Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s2860">Q: Now, did the Russians know who you really were?</span> <span id="s2861">They -- they knew who you -- they knew --</span></p> <p><span id="s2862">A: The Russians did.</span> <span id="s2863">They -- at first they -- what I know -- they were examining my -- my past, if I had worked with the Nazis or not.</span> <span id="s2864">My -- my past was -- was gloofsy and people told me that there were -- that they were interviewed about me and then they were -- as a -- I was working about -- after the Nuremberg tria-trial, the Russians wanted me to judge the Nazis, what I didn’t want to do.</span> <span id="s2865">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s2866">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s2867">A: I was the only Jew there.</span> <span id="s2868">Whatever I say would be wrong.</span> <span id="s2869">At first they would say is too strong an -- a -- a sentence or they would say it is too low a sentence.</span> <span id="s2870">I want -- I says, whatever I say, I had no confidence that my judgment would be accepted as ob-objective judgment.</span> <span id="s2871">And this is why I didn’t want to do it.</span> <span id="s2872">And because I had -- in the two years I worked there, I had no appellation against my sen -- any sentence of me.</span> <span id="s2873">Not from the attorney and not from the people.</span> <span id="s2874">They were -- it was accepted.</span> <span id="s2875">I was -- I -- I -- I ju -- I was working in criminal law.</span> <span id="s2876">Civil law was not very important at that time and I was working in family law and in youth.</span> <span id="s2877">They -- i-in -- the youngsters I didn’t want to send into prison -- 16 years or something.</span> <span id="s2878">They all were black marketing -- black market things.</span> <span id="s2879">So I -- I arranged -- I don’t know if it was legal at that time, now it is -- I didn’t -- don’t know -- I arranged that they have to work civ -- do civil work, because there was so much to do.</span> <span id="s2880">And that they have so many hours to work.</span> <span id="s2881">This was my invention.</span> <span id="s2882">I didn’t -- I don’t know if it was legal.</span> <span id="s2883">I -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2884">And -- and -- but I did it, because I didn’t want the youngsters to send to prison.</span> <span id="s2885">And they had to clean up the street and -- and work with old people or something.</span> <span id="s2886">The 16 and 17 years old.</span> <span id="s2887">Only one came back to -- to the court.</span> <span id="s2888">I suppose he will -- he has become a criminal, only one.</span> <span id="s2889">And the Russians had o -- all the prison.</span> <span id="s2890">So they were all free.</span> <span id="s2891">Many who were freed went into prison again and one was a special case.</span> <span id="s2892">He established himself as a doctor and after the first accidents, the first deaths, it came out that he isn’t a doctor.</span> <span id="s2893">And he was then -- came then to me and was put into prison again.</span> <span id="s2894">I know his mother came to me and said what a wonderful boy he was.</span> <span id="s2895">And he escaped from prison and after awhile, I got a letter from the west -- he escaped to the west, that he did the same there.</span> <span id="s2896">He established himself in the west as a doctor, he had -- yes, and he was caught in the west and they ask me what happened before.</span> <span id="s2897">So I know it.</span> <span id="s2898">This was -- was all in -- in the war.</span> <span id="s2899">Yes, it -- when -- when it came to it.</span> <span id="s2900">And -- but I -- I -- I had never a question, I wasn’t unsure, I had no sleepless night about my cases and I liked it.</span> <span id="s2901">I was -- I -- I was very happy in my profession.</span></p> <p><span id="s2902">Q: You -- you defended one person who was brought up on a criminal charge, a woman who had --</span></p> <p><span id="s2903">A: Yeah, yes.</span> <span id="s2904">She had murdered her three children.</span> <span id="s2905">And she was once my patient in the hospital.</span> <span id="s2906">And she was -- she had a very -- she told me all her stories when I was -- how brutal her husband was to her.</span> <span id="s2907">And she had -- in -- on the end of the war, murdered her three children, strangled them and -- and wanted commit suicide, jumped into the river.</span> <span id="s2908">And Russian soldiers saw it and saved her and -- and put her out.</span> <span id="s2909">And she got, she -- she -- she got sent -- an ex-officer, as a -- a -- a lawyer and when she heard that I am in the court, who did know her story, she ask the -- the director that I should defend her.</span> <span id="s2910">And the other lawyer, for her sake, put down his -- his -- his charge.</span> <span id="s2911">And she - -and I -- and this was the only case.</span> <span id="s2912">I was, at that time not -- not rikes-rikesflaga, that I was defend -- as a -- and I played -- I had made a play toyae about her and she got free.</span> <span id="s2913">Because I didn’t know her story so well.</span> <span id="s2914">She -- she had told it to me before and she -- she got free, she was -- and actually, she was then working with a woman, a friend, with the children.</span> <span id="s2915">And so it was a [indecipherable] -- it was the end of a very, very difficult life, what she did, because she had a very brutal husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s2916">Q: So what was your defense of her?</span></p> <p><span id="s2917">A: What -- what I told her story and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2918">Q: And they thought she shouldn’t be punished?</span></p> <p><span id="s2919">A: Yeah, I told her story, how sh -- how it developed and so she got free.</span> <span id="s2920">This was the only one that I was a defender.</span></p> <p><span id="s2921">Q: And what is happening to your daughter?</span> <span id="s2922">While you’re working, who’s taking care of her?</span> <span id="s2923">You now have a house.</span></p> <p><span id="s2924">A: She was -- she -- yes, she was -- during the day, she was in -- in a children’s -- th-this was Protestant nurses who took children in and I could leave her there even overnight when I once had to go to Berlin or something.</span> <span id="s2925">And she liked it and so she was very, very easy, everywhere she was very easy.</span> <span id="s2926">She was happy everywhere and everybody loved her and so if she -- but she got then diphtheria.</span> <span id="s2927">Yeah, she had diphtheria and this was -- and she was at home with diphtheria and I was -- stayed at home with her when she had diphtheria.</span> <span id="s2928">She was not in the hospital.</span> <span id="s2929">But after the diphtheria, she -- she had a -- a dark, smelly ossfloose --something coming out of her nose and she had to go to the hospital every few days to make -- for -- for to look after her.</span> <span id="s2930">And then I took her to Berlin, because in the east there was no penicillin.</span> <span id="s2931">And I took her to the French zone in Berlin and put her there into a hospital.</span> <span id="s2932">This was ‘47.</span> <span id="s2933">And -- and she was -- three weeks she was running about, because she wasn’t in bed any more, she was already healthy and she was running about.</span> <span id="s2934">I went once a week to visit her and she was running about with the nurses and she -- it -- it was easy with her.</span> <span id="s2935">You could tell her it is so and she didn’t cry and she accepted -- accepted it and after three wa -- weeks, she was cured.</span> <span id="s2936">They told me I could leave her, ish -- is -- but how can a girl run about -- be a danger to other people.</span> <span id="s2937">No, I didn’t -- and they had -- with penicillin she was cured.</span></p> <p><span id="s2938">Q: And when does Werner return?</span></p> <p><span id="s2939">A: A-At that time, when she was in hospital, when I told her, she -- she said only -- he had written to me, I don’t know, he hadn’t written, but she had the imagination, he had written to me.</span> <span id="s2940">She -- she didn’t know that he is coming.</span> <span id="s2941">She said -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2942">Q: Did she remember him?</span></p> <p><span id="s2943">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2944">Q: She didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s2945">A: She hadn’t seen him at all and she was a baby.</span> <span id="s2946">No, she didn’t know anything.</span> <span id="s2947">But maybe I told her and she -- she thought she had se -- he had written to her.</span> <span id="s2948">And then she came home and I had another girl in my house at that time, a girl from the orphanage, she’s was -- End of Tape Five, Side A Beginning Tape Five, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s2949">A: -- because she wasn’t in bed any more, she was already healthy and she was running about.</span> <span id="s2950">I went once a week to visit her and she was running about with the nurses and she -- it -- it was easy with her.</span> <span id="s2951">You could tell her it is so and she didn’t cry and she accepted -- accepted it and after three wa -- weeks, she was cured.</span> <span id="s2952">They told me I could leave her, ish -- is -- but how can a girl run about -- be a danger to other people.</span> <span id="s2953">No, I didn’t -- and they had -- with penicillin she was cured.</span></p> <p><span id="s2954">Q: And when does Werner return?</span></p> <p><span id="s2955">A: A-At that time, when she was in hospital, when I told her, she -- she said only -- he had written to me, I don’t know, he hadn’t written, but she had the imagination, he had written to me.</span> <span id="s2956">She -- she didn’t know that he is coming.</span> <span id="s2957">She said -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2958">Q: Did she remember him?</span></p> <p><span id="s2959">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2960">Q: She didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s2961">A: She hadn’t seen him at all and she was a baby.</span> <span id="s2962">No, she didn’t know anything.</span> <span id="s2963">But maybe I told her and she -- she thought she had se -- he had written to her.</span> <span id="s2964">And then she came home and I had another girl in my house at that time, a girl from the orphanage, she’s -- was her companion and they were happy together, they were -- it wa -- it worked all very normal.</span> <span id="s2965">Only Werner didn’t fit in.</span></p> <p><span id="s2966">Q: So that was difficult, when he --</span></p> <p><span id="s2967">A: Yes, it was diffi -- and the girls, when he left then, he left at first and went to sh -- Hilda Shlagel.</span> <span id="s2968">She was a widow at that time, already.</span> <span id="s2969">Her husband didn’t come home and he was welcomed there as a -- we -- she was a widow and the girls, the -- the two were very, very glad when he left.</span> <span id="s2970">Yeah, the children, because he was -- it -- it was a very easy living in my house, we were very, very happy.</span> <span id="s2971">And he was the one who disturbed the peace.</span></p> <p><span id="s2972">Q: And how did he disturb the peace?</span> <span id="s2973">What was --</span></p> <p><span id="s2974">A: How?</span></p> <p><span id="s2975">Q: Yeah, how?</span></p> <p><span id="s2976">A: A-At first -- at first he was brutal and he was -- he made the big row.</span> <span id="s2977">Maybe he had a so -- a hole in his sock.</span> <span id="s2978">This was my real occupation, to mend his socks, not to go to court.</span> <span id="s2979">And he -- he was -- as o -- i-in everything -- with the food and with everything, he -- and so he was very difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s2980">Q: So did you ask him to leave or did he leave on his own?</span></p> <p><span id="s2981">A: No, he leaved on his own.</span> <span id="s2982">I was ver -- I didn’t want hi -- I didn’t want a divorce.</span></p> <p><span id="s2983">Q: You didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s2984">A: No.</span> <span id="s2985">He wanted it.</span> <span id="s2986">He asked for the divorce.</span> <span id="s2987">Because he wanted to marry his first wife -- wife again and to live with her and with -- with the child.</span> <span id="s2988">And I -- and no, I didn’t want it.</span> <span id="s2989">He ask me even if I can ask to have it quicker sent to him, that -- so that he could marry quicker.</span> <span id="s2990">And he was -- married his first wife again and of course got divorced again.</span> <span id="s2991">And then -- he had not changed and she had not changed and then he got -- and I told him to go to the west.</span> <span id="s2992">I told him that.</span> <span id="s2993">He went to the west.</span> <span id="s2994">And in the west, I suppose he wanted to get something from organization.</span> <span id="s2995">I got an application, he had told that his wife -- that he -- he -- he and his wife had only divorced to save me, what wasn’t true [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2996">And I suppose he made an application maybe to the Joint or to anything and I got a -- I got a letter if it is true.</span> <span id="s2997">I didn’t want to do anything against him definitely, so I just didn’t open -- didn’t answer that letter.</span> <span id="s2998">And so I left -- I dropped it.</span> <span id="s2999">I won’t -- it didn’t come a second one, this was the only one.</span> <span id="s3000">But I suppose he wanted to get something at that time and had told such a lie.</span> <span id="s3001">But was not the first lie he told.</span> <span id="s3002">And -- and -- and then the -- I -- I didn’t react to it.</span> <span id="s3003">I didn’t want to -- to write that he’s a liar and I dropped it.</span> <span id="s3004">I didn’t -- and waited if I get the second.</span> <span id="s3005">But I didn’t get the second letter.</span></p> <p><span id="s3006">Q: Edith, why didn’t you want to divorce him?</span> <span id="s3007">Since it was so difficult, clearly you couldn’t live together?</span></p> <p><span id="s3008">A: I didn’t want to divorce him.</span> <span id="s3009">No, I hoped it -- I hoped it will be --</span></p> <p><span id="s3010">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3011">A: I mean there were difficulties, they -- people had changed.</span> <span id="s3012">A Nazi was nothing any more.</span> <span id="s3013">Before, he was a member of the party, now n-nothing wa -- it was nothing any more.</span> <span id="s3014">And I hope that he will get normal.</span> <span id="s3015">I didn’t want -- I didn’t want to live with him.</span> <span id="s3016">And so it -- it happened that he was divorced again and I don’t know, after -- he -- he married a few times more.</span></p> <p><span id="s3017">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s3018">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3019">He mar -- he married his fourth wife, yeah the fourth wife, I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s3020">I got to know aminster.</span> <span id="s3021">And we -- I -- I was always invited there.</span> <span id="s3022">She d-died a short time ago and when she -- Angela was then apported by the court to look aft -- to look after her as a guardian and this was the fourth wife and she -- he -- he got -- he was divorced of -- a-again to his first wife and then he married again a fifth -- a f -- a fifth -- I don’t know if he is st -- he -- no, at first he lived with somebody and then he married a-another one.</span> <span id="s3023">And so it -- he’s a difficult person, in that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s3024">Q: Was your -- do you think there was anything about your being Jewish after the war, that made a difference to him, or that it was [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3025">A: No, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s3026">No, no, no.</span> <span id="s3027">The other women were not Jewish and it was difficult with them atway -- had the same difficulties, no, I don’t think that this played a role.</span></p> <p><span id="s3028">Q: At -- at some point--</span></p> <p><span id="s3029">A: But he was influenced by Nazis -- Nazis in that way, that he said the Jewish race is stronger, as the Nazis say it.</span> <span id="s3030">And he say it when I wanted a baby even, that he is only the -- that will not be his baby in that way, it will be a Jewish baby.</span> <span id="s3031">It is because of the Jewish race and the -- he is only what they call the auslazin -- he -- his words, the auslazin, the elemen.</span> <span id="s3032">He is only one who makes it go -- who -- that it happens, but really, the Jewish race is stronger.</span> <span id="s3033">This was his -- his honest opinion.</span> <span id="s3034">I didn’t mind to have a Jewish child.</span></p> <p><span id="s3035">Q: When did he say that to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s3036">A: When I -- when I was -- when I --</span></p> <p><span id="s3037">Q: [indecipherable] was born?</span></p> <p><span id="s3038">A: When she was born, may before she was born.</span> <span id="s3039">Before she was born, even.</span> <span id="s3040">But I didn’t mind that she is my baby only, not his.</span> <span id="s3041">Didn’t mind that.</span> <span id="s3042">And Angela said afterwards, he said it to her, too.</span> <span id="s3043">But you hear it and hear it and hear it, so every -- it’s every German thought that he is something special.</span></p> <p><span id="s3044">Q: What was it like living under the Russians, in the --</span></p> <p><span id="s3045">A: Oh, under the Russians?</span> <span id="s3046">I had not contact with the Russians in -- in that way.</span> <span id="s3047">They came into the -- when they came to the -- to the court, they were very, very polite and ask me for -- they were not interested in the criminal law.</span> <span id="s3048">They were only interested in -- in something -- what happens with sabotage or something.</span> <span id="s3049">And actually, they -- there was a law -- they made a law you could char -- you could put into prison everybody, because of sabotage.</span> <span id="s3050">This was what we call the carchouk -- carchouk law.</span> <span id="s3051">As o -- what you can -- but nobody used it.</span> <span id="s3052">I never used it and I don’t think that anybody else used it.</span> <span id="s3053">And -- and though they were not -- as I -- they were not interested in the normal criminal law.</span> <span id="s3054">And only they wanted me to judge the -- the N-Nazis, what I didn’t do, and this was a bit difficult.</span> <span id="s3055">In the end, I had to give up being a judge and had to become an attorney, because of that.</span> <span id="s3056">But it was worthwhile.</span> <span id="s3057">And then he was in -- in -- in -- and then they wanted -- they encove -- encovered -- as o -- they get -- the Secret Service came.</span> <span id="s3058">And this was too much for me.</span> <span id="s3059">Nets -- you -- they wanted me to become an informer.</span> <span id="s3060">And this -- this as I -- was not -- couldn’t do.</span> <span id="s3061">But I could get everything from them if I would do it.</span> <span id="s3062">They s -- I could get food, I could have money, whatever I wanted.</span> <span id="s3063">They -- they are very cher -- ver -- they have been -- I was ill, they send me a kilo butter.</span> <span id="s3064">A kilo, this was a -- a fortune.</span> <span id="s3065">They send me in-into the hou -- into the -- without asking -- we -- I haven’t asked them to give me anything.</span> <span id="s3066">And they offered me money.</span> <span id="s3067">Ah, you --</span></p> <p><span id="s3068">Q: It’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3069">A: You [indecipherable] a day off, what --</span></p> <p><span id="s3070">Q: So you told them no?</span></p> <p><span id="s3071">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s3072">Q: You told them no?</span></p> <p><span id="s3073">A: No, they told me, you help -- we help you, now you help us.</span> <span id="s3074">They didn’t wear a uniform.</span> <span id="s3075">They went in civil -- they came to my flat -- they came to my flat.</span></p> <p><span id="s3076">Q: And what did you tell them?</span></p> <p><span id="s3077">A: I sa -- I -- I said that I don’t want to.</span> <span id="s3078">I so -- at first I said I want to -- I said I want to go to visit my sister.</span> <span id="s3079">And when they -- I -- I’m going -- I want to go to England to visit my sister.</span> <span id="s3080">I had a visitor permit.</span> <span id="s3081">And they said I will be arrested in -- in England.</span> <span id="s3082">I wasn’t afraid of being arrested in England.</span> <span id="s3083">And there was a meeting in the flat of a officer, Russian officer, where I was -- there was something, somebody higher than the -- I -- because nobody spoke when this man spoke.</span> <span id="s3084">And this was the one who told me I will be arrested and everything, when I go to England, but I -- it only made me sure that I have to go.</span> <span id="s3085">I could -- you ca -- cannot say straight, “I don’t do it,” because they don’t accept it</span></p> <p><span id="s3086">Q: Let’s take a break.</span></p> <p><span id="s3087">End of Tape Five, Side B Beginning Tape Six, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s3088">Q: Edith, can you -- can you tell us how you got out of Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s3089">A: This is a long story.</span> <span id="s3090">I -- well I dec -- I decided I had -- I had sleepless nights at that time, believe me.</span> <span id="s3091">And I didn’t tell anybody.</span> <span id="s3092">In the end I told one, the director of the amski -- of the amskery.</span> <span id="s3093">I told him, but I didn’t tell anybody else, I didn’t want that somebody has to carry a secret.</span> <span id="s3094">And I didn’t write -- after awhile to anybody, because I know the le -- the letters are s -- I didn’t want to bring anybody in danger.</span> <span id="s3095">This was my reason.</span> <span id="s3096">And -- as o -- I had to come to a passport and then I rented in the end, a room in Berlin, what I was told by -- in -- in a British -- in the British office and I applied for a passport there.</span> <span id="s3097">And I ha -- I didn’t need for that a -- a document of -- of the police, that I can come -- come through.</span> <span id="s3098">Because it was forbidden, even for Berliners to come -- to lea -- to go back to Berlin.</span> <span id="s3099">And I waited for this police officer I know and I told him that I don’t want any food or anything, I only want a -- this is in the -- in -- in the documents, too -- a personal, like it was youn ousewise, that I -- and he gave it to me.</span> <span id="s3100">He said he knows England and was very friendly and he gave it to me and then I got my passport in French -- French, English and Russian, not a German word was in it.</span> <span id="s3101">I am sorry they took it from me, they should -- I should not have given it to them.</span> <span id="s3102">The Germans took it then from me when I got a German passport.</span> <span id="s3103">And I’m -- I’m sorry I haven’t got it any more.</span> <span id="s3104">And when my -- my -- I wrote to my sister that I’m coming.</span> <span id="s3105">I had a visitor permit for two months and this is normal.</span> <span id="s3106">And in England you cannot change a permit easily.</span> <span id="s3107">It’s not changed.</span> <span id="s3108">And this -- and when I came to England then with my daughter, without luggage, because I didn’t take anything.</span> <span id="s3109">I had eve -- I had not even a chane -- a dress to change.</span> <span id="s3110">My brother-in-law was shocked that I am a refugee and cannot go -- he wanted me -- as -- a-actually his mother and his -- has said he should not invite -- they should not invite me and they have sent me this visitor permit and it was a -- a very, very big shock for them and he wanted me -- as o -- he said a-at first I am a liar, because I didn’t write that -- how can I write that I am f-fleeing?</span> <span id="s3111">I am a liar, a je -- an Englishman would never lie.</span> <span id="s3112">This was -- yeah, he said it to me.</span> <span id="s3113">An Englishman would never lie and I was an -- and so it was -- it was hell to be there, hell -- with my -- my sister said to me, you break up my marriage.</span> <span id="s3114">And was -- was a -- whats -- it was really not -- not overdone, it was true, because they were so much against me, because I was a refugee.</span> <span id="s3115">I was welcome for two months as a -- as a guest, but they didn’t want me as a refugee and I suppose his parents had said -- were afraid they have to look after me or help me or something.</span> <span id="s3116">I thought they were -- they were -- it was hell.</span> <span id="s3117">And then --</span></p> <p><span id="s3118">Q: This is -- this is Hansie?</span></p> <p><span id="s3119">A: Hansie, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3120">Q: Who left Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s3121">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3122">Q: To go to [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3123">A: Who -- who -- yes, she married him in -- in the arm -- in the army in Rome.</span> <span id="s3124">And she -- I think they never wanted him to marry a Jew.</span> <span id="s3125">It was his family and he was -- was be -- getting -- he was at law school to become a solicitor.</span> <span id="s3126">And he was living on what he got as -- from the army, but this was not enough, the parents gave them every -- gave them the money, as he was studying.</span> <span id="s3127">And they were living in a house which belonged to -- to his parents.</span> <span id="s3128">As o -- I was get -- I was not a welcome guest.</span> <span id="s3129">And he wrote to the -- to -- to the Home Office, they sh -- they should deport me, yes.</span> <span id="s3130">But they didn’t.</span> <span id="s3131">And -- and -- an MP -- a labor MP it was, who happened -- I don’t know how, about my story.</span> <span id="s3132">And I was -- I came then in touch with the foreign people, I was then staying with a cousin of mine and I came -- I don’t know any more, how it all came about, I came then in touch with a Dr. Davis a -- a -- a -- a late doctor, in Stamford Hill and this -- this labor MP, the letter I got is in the documents, he wrote to me when -- when she has difficulty with me to get the working -- is very difficult to chern -- to -- to change a visitor permit into a working permit, when -- if she has difficulties, they should turn to him.</span> <span id="s3133">He would do it.</span> <span id="s3134">And according -- when I showed that letter to the police in Piccadilly, those foreign police, I got some per-permission to work -- a working permission.</span> <span id="s3135">And I was then working with -- staying with this doctor and I could have stayed there for years, but I was staying for months, many months and she aray -- Angela went there to school in -- and she [indecipherable], she was anti-doctor and she went into her bed in the morning, Angela and she had no social life at all, only family life.</span> <span id="s3136">She was living with her mother.</span> <span id="s3137">And the reason for me to leave was that I didn’t hear an English word.</span> <span id="s3138">I couldn’t stay forever.</span> <span id="s3139">She spoke Yiddish with her mother and her mother couldn’t speak a word of English, they were from Romania.</span> <span id="s3140">Her wather was one of the directors of Sch-Schtettna, you know this firm?</span> <span id="s3141">This is a publicating firm, I think, a big one.</span> <span id="s3142">And he was a director.</span> <span id="s3143">And -- but I didn’t meet -- and a brother of her had a hat factory in Manchester.</span> <span id="s3144">And so I -- and I was treated there very nicely.</span> <span id="s3145">I didn’t want -- as a maid, I didn’t want to go in when she had visitor, but she said when I don’t go in, she stays with me in the kitchen -- the doctor.</span> <span id="s3146">And so I was really very nicely treated in that house.</span> <span id="s3147">And -- but then in the end I decided I have to f-find a way to -- to -- to do some Engl -- learn some English.</span> <span id="s3148">And I put an advertisement in the Times, as I made it out to -- after I saw advertisement, I don’t know it was the Times or the Telegraph.</span> <span id="s3149">And a -- a -- a lady answered and it was -- the lady -- had more answers, but I couldn’t -- some people ha -- were living abroa -- outside, where there was no school nearby.</span> <span id="s3150">I couldn’t go to a place where there was no school.</span> <span id="s3151">And one lady -- I had an interview, it was the sister-in-law of Antony Eden.</span> <span id="s3152">It was the wife of Sir Timothy Eden.</span> <span id="s3153">And she had a school in England and -- Idlan, and a school in Southampton.</span> <span id="s3154">And she wanted me -- she was an Austrian and she of course expected that every Austrian is a perfect cook and she wanted me to cook for her school in Southampton.</span> <span id="s3155">And there were 24 pupils in the school and I accepted.</span> <span id="s3156">Not that I was a cook, but I had a cookery book in Austrian for -- what a -- somebody gave me and you wouldn’t believe it, but they liked my cooking, because the girls had never eaten -- I su -- I suppose an Austrian would have thrown me out nex-next day, but they -- but these girls in the school had never eaten my cook -- Austrian cooking and they liked it.</span> <span id="s3157">The kinerl and all this what I’d -- I -- I so -- I started se -- very exactly the cookery book, every day and it was successful.</span> <span id="s3158">I was there for quite a time, I don’t know any more how long.</span> <span id="s3159">Angela was taken into the school and was exactly treated, we -- like any other girl, there was no difference.</span> <span id="s3160">They were very -- she -- I bought the uniform for her and she was bathed and washed by the matron.</span> <span id="s3161">And the matron put her to bed, as a -- I must say, I -- there were no difference at all to any other girl in the school, she was -- when she was there.</span> <span id="s3162">And in the end, I went back to -- to London.</span> <span id="s3163">I was very lonely, of course and her -- her -- s-son of them, who was at that time a young man, he came from Eden and he was -- he was living there.</span> <span id="s3164">Now he is an MP in -- in the House of Parliament and the kitchen maid what they had, was a Hungarian Baroness at that time, because they were the Russians and she came to London and was a 19 year old girl.</span> <span id="s3165">She was working there and she was [indecipherable] a Hungarian Baron -- aristocrat.</span> <span id="s3166">And so -- in any case, then I went back to London with Angela and I went -- I could give -- I -- I -- I was working -- living in the house.</span> <span id="s3167">This was the daughter of the British am-ambassador in Norway.</span> <span id="s3168">But they were very -- they had a house in Kensington.</span> <span id="s3169">I had one s-sh -- I had only working permission for a housemaid.</span> <span id="s3170">I couldn’t do anything else.</span> <span id="s3171">And she engaged me as housemaid, but she didn’t pay me.</span> <span id="s3172">They were -- they hadn’t any money, actually.</span> <span id="s3173">He was studying at -- architecture, a young couple and I work -- went out to work, I worked illegal.</span> <span id="s3174">People who -- who did surgical belts engaged me.</span></p> <p><span id="s3175">Q: Who did what?</span></p> <p><span id="s3176">A: Surgical belts.</span></p> <p><span id="s3177">Q: Sur -- oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3178">A: This is for people who have operations.</span> <span id="s3179">They made -- and I came to that place and she said, you ha -- toos -- to teach me s -- s -- with electric machine, to sew.</span> <span id="s3180">And when I saw what she did, I said to her I can do the same what she did, she --and then I did the cutting out and was in charge of the -- of -- of the room, because at that time, the health service was new in England and you can only get the working permission if they haven’t got any Englishmen to do the work, or English women.</span> <span id="s3181">And I was in -- and the cert -- in this business.</span> <span id="s3182">The ba -- both was a Viennese.</span> <span id="s3183">In this business they didn’t have workers, because it was so new, the health service.</span> <span id="s3184">And so I got the working permission.</span> <span id="s3185">When I got the working permission on -- on -- in the labor exchange, she was co -- ringing up other labor exchanges at first, if they have somebody for the job, but they didn’t.</span> <span id="s3186">And so I got the working permission there.</span> <span id="s3187">I did send the cutting out and fitting for surgical belts and I went into hospitals to measure people and had -- there were eight people sewing these belts.</span> <span id="s3188">And this I did for years, for many years there in -- in that job.</span></p> <p><span id="s3189">Q: Did you get back to having a relationship with your sister, Hansie?</span></p> <p><span id="s3190">A: No, I haven’t heard from her for -- for years [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s3191">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s3192">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3193">I had a very loose -- sometime -- once -- as a -- actually, it was agreement that Angela stays with her until the school starts, because there was no school at that time and suddenly she rang me up, I must take Angela away at once from her, because her husband has an examination at the law school and when he doesn’t pass, he will say Angela -- it’s Angela’s fault that he doesn’t.</span> <span id="s3194">Yeah, i-it -- this was -- he was horrible.</span> <span id="s3195">And so I told it to the doctor and she said, “Take it, she can come before the school starts.”</span></p> <p><span id="s3196">Q: And Mimi?</span></p> <p><span id="s3197">A: Mimi was in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s3198">Q: And s -- and -- how --</span></p> <p><span id="s3199">A: I wanted actually, when I came to -- at first to go to Israel, but I went to the embassy and at that time you did need an invitation.</span> <span id="s3200">The state was only half a year old, you did need an invitation.</span> <span id="s3201">So I sent a telegram to Mimi, she should send me the invitation, but she didn’t answer.</span> <span id="s3202">She didn’t want -- she was always jealous of me and she didn’t want me in Israel.</span> <span id="s3203">And she didn’t send me the invitation so I could go.</span> <span id="s3204">Later on, years later, I was very lonely.</span> <span id="s3205">M-My life in Israel would have been easier, because I wouldn’t -- I would have joined a kibbutz and I would not have been so lonely, with no English and bound with -- in the job, with a child.</span> <span id="s3206">You couldn’t go out anywhere.</span> <span id="s3207">I would not -- and later on, once Angela was at school and was on holiday, I thought I go to Israel in a fortnight whe -- when she is in England in -- on holiday in the summer.</span> <span id="s3208">And I wrote my sister that I want to come.</span> <span id="s3209">And her answer was not, “I’m looking forward to see you.”</span> <span id="s3210">Her answer was, “Don’t give up your job.”</span> <span id="s3211">And so she was afraid now, I don’t know what Hansie has written -- that I would come and be in -- something -- so I didn’t go.</span> <span id="s3212">This was the end of my visit, I didn’t go.</span> <span id="s3213">I didn’t see her.</span> <span id="s3214">And -- and so I -- I was staying in -- in London and was working at -- Angela was -- it was a difficulty where to live.</span> <span id="s3215">She was in different school, in four different school and in England at that time, I don’t know if you know, they made the 11 plus.</span> <span id="s3216">This was with 11 -- at the age of 11, every child had to make an exam.</span> <span id="s3217">If they get -- if they are ready for grammar school.</span> <span id="s3218">And she was in four different schools and she -- and in the end she was in the Solomon Wolfser school and there were 28 pupils and only four passed the exam.</span> <span id="s3219">And she was one of the four.</span> <span id="s3220">When she rang me up in my business, she passed, I couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s3221">I rang up at first somebody else if it’s true that she passed.</span> <span id="s3222">And then I left everything and -- and so she could go to grammar school.</span> <span id="s3223">She want -- won a -- a scholarship for a grammar school and she was taken by -- by the Burlington School.</span> <span id="s3224">This is a very old school with a good name and it was -- this is where she told -- she had an interview where she told she sees her father every two years.</span> <span id="s3225">And the headmistress -- in when I had the interview, she ask me what -- what it means.</span> <span id="s3226">So I told her I’m divorced, she didn’t know that I’m divorced, no.</span> <span id="s3227">She didn’t -- when I told her -- she was eleven [indecipherable] I must tell that I’m divorced.</span> <span id="s3228">When I told her, she said, “It can’t be.</span> <span id="s3229">You love each other.”</span> <span id="s3230">But she didn’t know.</span> <span id="s3231">She was brought up like in a complete family, I didn’t want her to know.</span> <span id="s3232">But then she -- and then she was [indecipherable] was in Burlington school and -- until I got married and then I may -- I moved -- she moved to a different school, to Copedale in Edgeware.</span></p> <p><span id="s3233">Q: And you married Fritz Beer?</span></p> <p><span id="s3234">A: Fred Beer, in -- on the 24th of March, 1957.</span></p> <p><span id="s3235">Q: And he -- he was due -- he comes from Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s3236">A: Yeah, he comes from Vienna, he wa -- he comes -- his mother was deported -- was deported to Theresienstadt and died in the -- in -- in the Holocaust, as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s3237">Q: You didn’t know him in Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s3238">A: No.</span> <span id="s3239">But he did know some of my family.</span></p> <p><span id="s3240">Q: He did?</span></p> <p><span id="s3241">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s3242">But not me and not my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s3243">Q: And that was a good relationship for you and for Angela?</span></p> <p><span id="s3244">A: Yeah, and I ask Angela --</span></p> <p><span id="s3245">Q: When he proposed to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s3246">A: Yeah, when he proposed to me, I ask Angela.</span></p> <p><span id="s3247">Q: And what did she say?</span></p> <p><span id="s3248">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s3249">She agreed, you see?</span> <span id="s3250">Now, because she was my first obligation, I couldn’t do that without asking her.</span> <span id="s3251">And it was -- she then -- she was in Copdory and she made -- actually I’m -- I sent her after the O levels in an academic exchange to Germany.</span> <span id="s3252">She made A level in Germany, that she should learn German properly, because she couldn’t speak German properly and this is where she met her future husband.</span> <span id="s3253">I didn’t send her that she gets married there, but he -- at the school party and she was there at school, that she was then living with her father for six months, I want her to know him and she went there to school and at a school party she met him.</span> <span id="s3254">And they invited her always again -- again -- again to come and so it happened that she married.</span> <span id="s3255">One day she came home from Winster and said, “I am engaged.”</span> <span id="s3256">She didn’t ask me, she said, “I am engaged to be married.”</span> <span id="s3257">And so it came that she got married to a German.</span> <span id="s3258">And she won then a scholarship to the Royal College of Art.</span> <span id="s3259">This is a -- a special place in -- in London.</span> <span id="s3260">When she -- when she applied for it, I di-didn’t think that she could win, but she did.</span></p> <p><span id="s3261">Q: What was it like for her to meet her father and spent six -- she was 16 years old, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s3262">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s3263">He was very, very keen to meet her.</span> <span id="s3264">He wrote me that he will look after her.</span> <span id="s3265">But he was, I suppose, brutal to her, because he -- he -- he -- as o -- I don’t know why -- I don’t know why, but he smacked her once so much that she had to have an oper -- that she still is not able to o -- to open her mouth properly.</span> <span id="s3266">She was -- she had an operation.</span></p> <p><span id="s3267">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s3268">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s3269">She was injured, but he is a str -- a strong -- a strong man and he smacked her as o -- she did not do what she -- what he wants.</span> <span id="s3270">I don’t know, I wasn’t there, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3271">Q: Did she leave immediately after that happened or she stayed?</span></p> <p><span id="s3272">A: No, she -- I -- I don’t know when it happened, exactly.</span> <span id="s3273">She came home as it was -- as it was agreed on.</span></p> <p><span id="s3274">Q: Did she know who he was then?</span> <span id="s3275">I mean, I know who -- she knew that he was her father.</span></p> <p><span id="s3276">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3277">Q: But did she know the history then of what had happened to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s3278">A: No, she didn’t know.</span> <span id="s3279">No, she -- she came -- he -- I don’t know how much he told her, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s3280">And so -- she didn’t know anything, only that he is her father.</span></p> <p><span id="s3281">Q: And you very consciously, didn’t tell her?</span></p> <p><span id="s3282">A: Yeah, I didn’t.</span> <span id="s3283">No, she had enough with losing every -- I didn’t want to add something.</span> <span id="s3284">So she -- she didn’t know that it’s a broken family, I didn’t want to add -- to add more to -- more trouble than she already had to -- to put up with.</span></p> <p><span id="s3285">Q: So when did she find out?</span> <span id="s3286">When were you able to talk with each other about what it was that happened to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s3287">A: What had happened about -- about the Holocaust [indecipherable] we didn’t talk about it at all, not much.</span> <span id="s3288">I don’t -- I -- I -- I can’t say that.</span> <span id="s3289">I didn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s3290">Q: But at some point you show her the documents [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3291">A: Very [indecipherable] years later.</span></p> <p><span id="s3292">Q: Years later?</span></p> <p><span id="s3293">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s3294">I don’t know exactly when it was.</span> <span id="s3295">And consciously, to sit down and talk to her, I never did, no.</span> <span id="s3296">It came slowly.</span> <span id="s3297">But I didn’t -- I don’t -- didn’t wan -- I wanted her -- sh-she had enough to put up with, I wanted her to grow up as a normal, English girl, not -- at the beginning she mixed up Austria and Australia.</span> <span id="s3298">I know she did mix it up.</span> <span id="s3299">And -- and it was -- you -- you don’t want -- so she went to school and grew up and she grew up as an English -- I s -- I didn’t speak English to her, didn’t want her to get my accent.</span></p> <p><span id="s3300">Q: So what did you speak to her, German?</span></p> <p><span id="s3301">A: German.</span> <span id="s3302">And she answered in English.</span> <span id="s3303">And when she was cheeky, I didn’t understand it in any case, this was a positive --</span></p> <p><span id="s3304">Q: It was positive for her.</span></p> <p><span id="s3305">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3306">Q: Did -- did you talk with -- with Fritz Beer about your past or did you not talk with him either, I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s3307">A: No, we -- we didn’t know each other, that both his mother, he -- he came from Prague [indecipherable] last and he was with one of the last planes he came and he actually waited f-for mother’s birthday.</span> <span id="s3308">As long as he could -- he was a mother’s boy.</span> <span id="s3309">He got married only after his mother was died -- was -- was away.</span> <span id="s3310">He got -- very late he married.</span> <span id="s3311">He was 11 years older than I -- than I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s3312">Q: Were you his first marriage or his second?</span></p> <p><span id="s3313">A: No, I was his second.</span> <span id="s3314">He was a widower, too.</span> <span id="s3315">His first wife died of a heart failure and he was two years a widow.</span> <span id="s3316">And then I -- I -- when I met him.</span> <span id="s3317">And I -- I didn’t know and so he tried to get his mother ous, but he -- it didn’t work and he had lost him mother in the Holocaust and I had lost my mother.</span> <span id="s3318">But then, people didn’t talk about it then, we didn’t talk.</span> <span id="s3319">Nobody did talk about it, it was accepted, it was a fact and -- but we -- we didn’t talk about it much.</span></p> <p><span id="s3320">Q: Do you wish you had?</span></p> <p><span id="s3321">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s3322">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3323">Q: And what is it like for you now?</span> <span id="s3324">Now you’re talking about it so much, did that come [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3325">A: Yeah, it came so -- in -- in -- it is now sometimes -- many things come up now, to me and sometimes disturbing.</span> <span id="s3326">I cannot so easily concentrate on other things, even on books or something, because it comes i-in tre -- in between.</span></p> <p><span id="s3327">Q: And it didn’t come in between so much before?</span></p> <p><span id="s3328">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s3329">He had a busine -- he was a businessman.</span> <span id="s3330">He was a -- a wholesaler in this -- these things and in j-jewelry.</span> <span id="s3331">But not -- not expensive jewelry, in -- and h -- he was sent to Australia.</span> <span id="s3332">This was before his first marriage, even, as an enemy alien, fron -- from England and he came back after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s3333">Q: And so you lived together for how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s3334">A: For 30 -- more than th -- from ‘47 to ‘84, when he died.</span></p> <p><span id="s3335">Q: No, ‘57, I think you mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s3336">A: ‘57 --</span></p> <p><span id="s3337">Q: ‘57 until ‘84.</span></p> <p><span id="s3338">A: ‘57 to ‘84, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3339">Q: So, that’s a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s3340">A: He was very, very ill.</span> <span id="s3341">He had [indecipherable] there were -- he was very, very ill.</span> <span id="s3342">He was a heavy smoker and he -- from this smoking he was very, very ill.</span> <span id="s3343">I was -- and then he had a -- in the dam, a hole.</span> <span id="s3344">He had -- for six months, he had a hole here, because he had a dam operation.</span> <span id="s3345">And so he was -- had -- had -- was very, very ill.</span></p> <p><span id="s3346">Q: But your daughter felt as -- he was her father?</span></p> <p><span id="s3347">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3348">Q: So this was very important for her?</span></p> <p><span id="s3349">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s3350">I know -- when he was so ill, I didn’t want her to go to see him, because I had tell -- told him stories.</span> <span id="s3351">I didn’t want that he knows that he’s so ill.</span> <span id="s3352">I didn’t -- I -- I -- I said to -- it was a-about Christmas time and I could go into the hospital at any time, because he was on the danger list.</span> <span id="s3353">I didn’t want him to know that, that he’s on the danger list.</span> <span id="s3354">I said always, I -- I sneaked in to the hospital, because they are pre-preparing for Christmas.</span> <span id="s3355">And I didn’t want that Angela would -- me -- would -- would to -- take -- talk silly things.</span> <span id="s3356">So I left her and then she was -- as o -- stricken, she was crying.</span> <span id="s3357">I -- I don’t want her to see her father.</span> <span id="s3358">She was very, very upset.</span> <span id="s3359">But for me it was a reason.</span> <span id="s3360">I didn’t want her to -- to say something what make him think of it.</span> <span id="s3361">But he was very, very ill.</span></p> <p><span id="s3362">Q: And then, when he died, you decided to change your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s3363">A: No, I had to.</span> <span id="s3364">I had to.</span> <span id="s3365">I was living in the house with -- three bedroom house with three double bedrooms, a garden in front and what should I do in that house?</span> <span id="s3366">And I had the feeling -- I couldn’t sit in the sitting room after -- after he was dead, without him.</span> <span id="s3367">You live in the sitting room and to sit alone, it was terrible.</span> <span id="s3368">I never went into -- I never went -- looked at television and went into the sitting room and then I decide -- as I had to -- to sell the house, in any case.</span> <span id="s3369">It did need a time until it got the probate.</span> <span id="s3370">It was -- was all in his name.</span> <span id="s3371">A year I did need to get the probate.</span> <span id="s3372">And then I decided that -- to give up the house.</span> <span id="s3373">And now where to go was the problem.</span> <span id="s3374">And then, I so -- I could -- cannot drive a car and London was a difficult place to be -- Angela was not living in London at that time and so I went to Israel, as -- I found that is the natural place for me.</span> <span id="s3375">And I was ha-half -- and I li -- I wanted to live in a smaller place, as I cannot drive a car, where I can walk to some -- where I can walk.</span> <span id="s3376">And in -- in London, I was all -- when I went to see somebody, was an hour on the underground.</span> <span id="s3377">When -- do you know London?</span> <span id="s3378">Yeah, then you do, that you can imagine, I -- I was from Edgeware, this is in the north.</span> <span id="s3379">I was always on the underground.</span> <span id="s3380">And then I gave up to meet somebody, because of the journey.</span> <span id="s3381">And so I wanted to live in a small place.</span> <span id="s3382">I hoped -- I was afraid of the language and I hoped I will learn it, as a -- at the beginning I was better, but I lost a little since I have cable television.</span> <span id="s3383">I cannot make up my mind to -- to put it off, the English and to listen to the Hebrew, where I understand only partly.</span> <span id="s3384">And this is the death of my Hebrew, the -- the cable television.</span></p> <p><span id="s3385">Q: The cable.</span></p> <p><span id="s3386">A: What?</span> <span id="s3387">Can you imagine?</span></p> <p><span id="s3388">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3389">A: Then I -- I --</span></p> <p><span id="s3390">Q: Through your third marriage, did you keep -- you kept in touch with Peppy until he died?</span></p> <p><span id="s3391">A: W-With my -- with my second -- with my second, my -- my -- I can’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s3392">Q: I mean your second.</span></p> <p><span id="s3393">A: I -- so, yeah.</span> <span id="s3394">I -- no, I -- I was not in regular contact, but when I was in Vienna, I visited him.</span> <span id="s3395">He didn’t know -- he got to know my husband and -- and -- but I wasn’t -- and I did know his wife, but it was not a regular -- not anything as it was before, not anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s3396">Q: But when did you get the letters that you had written to him?</span> <span id="s3397">It was after he married?</span></p> <p><span id="s3398">A: Yeah, yes, h-he was a -- yes, it -- he was already mar -- I didn’t go so early to -- to Vienna again and I -- he was already married and then I ask him to -- to have it back.</span></p> <p><span id="s3399">Q: And why did you ask him?</span></p> <p><span id="s3400">A: I tell you, I di-didn’t want that his wife is reading my love letters.</span> <span id="s3401">This was the reason, not -- not -- no other reason and I said -- and he didn -- he said he wants to keep them so long he -- as long as he’s alive.</span> <span id="s3402">Noneday I mention when he had something happen to him, she would put it in the mill -- millima when she sees -- when she sees what that is.</span></p> <p><span id="s3403">Q: So if he had not gotten married, we never would -- we might not have these letters.</span></p> <p><span id="s3404">A: Yeah, may [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s3405">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s3406">What have -- would have -- but you can imagine that I felt that this part of my life is now in his ha -- ha -- in -- in her hands, in the end.</span> <span id="s3407">And so, this was the reason, I didn’t think of the histor -- historical value at that time.</span> <span id="s3408">And so -- and then he gave it to me and I -- I took it home and put it in a drawer and didn’t talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3409">Q: Did you look at them?</span></p> <p><span id="s3410">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3411">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3412">A: No, I di -- I do -- I know what is in.</span> <span id="s3413">I didn’t look at them at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s3414">Q: And what year?</span> <span id="s3415">Do you remember approximately what year you got them?</span></p> <p><span id="s3416">A: No, I didn -- I -- I don’t know -- as -- it happened then, when I -- when I sold the house and when I -- and I had some -- wh-when did I give?</span> <span id="s3417">I think I had some in Israel and then I was thinking what happens -- I can -- I -- I’m e -- not immortal, I noticed.</span> <span id="s3418">And so, if somebody ha-happened to me, they would throw these letters away, too.</span> <span id="s3419">In German, in small, you see how small the papers in [indecipherable] who -- whoever will read that.</span> <span id="s3420">And then I gave it to Angela.</span> <span id="s3421">I thought this is the only place -- and so she may be interested one day.</span> <span id="s3422">And so it came.</span> <span id="s3423">She put it in a safe at first and -- and -- and so it came, I gave it to her -- as I gave her some of my jewelry.</span> <span id="s3424">I gave her not only that ac -- she had -- has my jewelry as well.</span> <span id="s3425">I gave it to her.</span></p> <p><span id="s3426">Q: And did she then read these letters?</span></p> <p><span id="s3427">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s3428">Q: Did she read them?</span></p> <p><span id="s3429">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3430">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3431">A: No, because she -- because they are in German.</span></p> <p><span id="s3432">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3433">A: She -- she doesn’t read German books.</span> <span id="s3434">She reads the German books in English translations, what I found horrible.</span> <span id="s3435">She speaks --</span></p> <p><span id="s3436">Q: But she speaks fluent?</span></p> <p><span id="s3437">A: Fluent, yes, she has teetoed so long, but she is -- so a German book, when you give her, it’s like poison.</span> <span id="s3438">She doesn’t -- she reads the German books in -- in English translation.</span></p> <p><span id="s3439">Q: But not because -- she’s able to, but she doesn’t to?</span></p> <p><span id="s3440">A: Yes, she doesn’t want -- she finds the s-sentences are too long, the words are not -- not what she wants and so she just hates it.</span> <span id="s3441">And I find it horrible, but what can I do?</span> <span id="s3442">And she would not -- she is not one who know -- who reads such small print and handwritten print, no.</span> <span id="s3443">Even Thomas Mann she read in -- i-in -- she’s a very avid reader, but in English translations.</span> <span id="s3444">I -- as -- this is -- can’t help it, this is outside my under -- I read German books, I wouldn’t read it in English translation, wouldn’t touch it -- I wouldn’t -- when I read the German book and -- even French I read in the -- I -- I was reading French, now I’m not -- I was even in England still reading French.</span> <span id="s3445">I wrote -- I wrote -- Sartre and this book.</span> <span id="s3446">But in -- in the original, yes, I wrote many books in -- in the French original, but never in translation.</span></p> <p><span id="s3447">Q: Edith, is there anything more that you would like to say that I -- I haven’t asked you or you would like to say to the world that will be watching this interview whenever they wish?</span></p> <p><span id="s3448">A: What I want to say -- I want to say that they should learn from the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s3449">The wells of a -- of human beings.</span> <span id="s3450">The -- the worse of human beings and live in a way that it doesn’t -- recut -- I have -- when I was working in -- we had [indecipherable] when I was working the surgical belt business, the boss came to me and ask me if he -- it -- it was difficult to get in -- to get people.</span> <span id="s3451">If he -- if I allow him to unga -- engage a Jamaican -- a color -- a Negro.</span> <span id="s3452">Of course I said yes, I would not take it, I said yes.</span> <span id="s3453">And we had then a Jamaican sewer.</span> <span id="s3454">And one of the girls was an Irish girl and something disappeared once in the sho -- in -- in this work room and everybody was looking at the Jamaican, everybody.</span> <span id="s3455">I have -- when -- it was that she was li -- like living -- everybody as so the Jamai -- and in real, we -- as it was found out later, it was not something very -- of high value, but it -- it -- has something disappeared and it came out that the Irish girl who had taken it.</span> <span id="s3456">Nobody thought -- looked at an English girl and everybod -- this is a racial prejudice -- was looking at the Jamaican girl, who didn’t have taken it.</span> <span id="s3457">And she had not a comfortable living at -- and working at that time and I have learned it in -- in that way, what it means to be prejudice -- what prejudice means.</span></p> <p><span id="s3458">Q: Well, I thank you very much for all your time.</span> <span id="s3459">And for your letters and all the documents.</span> <span id="s3460">Thank you [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s3461">A: I thought maybe they are of any use for the future.</span> <span id="s3462">This is my only
