Mrs. Hanna Sechel, S-E-C-H-E-L.</span> <span id="s19">This is tape one, side one, March 26, 1981, Nora Levin interviewing.</span> <span id="s20">[tape off then on] Corrections, this is 1982, and please spell Mrs. Seckel’s name S-E-C-K-E-L.</span> <span id="s21">Mrs. Seckel, can you first please tell us a little about your childhood, where you were born, and when, and a little about your family background?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A:O.</span> <span id="s23">K., I was born in Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q:In what town, please?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A:I was born in Kolin, which is like 60 kilometers out of Prague, but I moved when I was eight months old, which I don’t remember, to Prague.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q:How do you spell that, please?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A:My, K-O-L-I-N.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q:Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A:My grandparents, both my grandparents lived in that town.</span> <span id="s30">My parents then moved before I was one year to Prague.</span> <span id="s31">My father got into business.</span> <span id="s32">My mother was 19 when I was born, so basically I had a very young parent.</span> <span id="s33">I had a brother who was four years younger than I, and I think that as all middle-class Jewish families, the education, the religion, and the family circle was very important to us.</span> <span id="s34">You...</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q:You had just one brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A:I just had one brother.</span> <span id="s37">My mother was out of seven.</span> <span id="s38">My father was out of three.</span> <span id="s39">We were a very close clan with the whole family.</span> <span id="s40">There were no holidays where not everybody got together, except that one of my aunts, she divorced and that was grosse Schande [great shame].</span> <span id="s41">And another aunt married a Gentile.</span> <span id="s42">That was even worse.</span> <span id="s43">Actually she was the only one who survived, except me.</span> <span id="s44">So, the...</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q:You were...</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A:Family closeness was very important and we were always taught you do not do anything bad or so to speak or out of line, because you would shame the family.</span> <span id="s47">And we had a very close ties with the family, which I think our generation doesn’t understand at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q:Was it an observant family?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A:No.</span> <span id="s50">No.</span> <span id="s51">I think we, you know, just celebrated the holidays, but no, we didn’t keep kashrut at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q:Did you go to the synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q:On high...</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A:We went to the synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q:Holidays?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A:On high holidays.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q:On the high holidays.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A:And other children, you know, when I was a girl, when I was little I was allowed to go to the men’s section with my dad.</span> <span id="s60">That was sort of a very highlight thing.</span> <span id="s61">I, when I got ten I couldn’t, and that was sort of a heartbreak...</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q:Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A:Not to be able, because then I had to go over to the women’s section.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q:At ten.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A:Yeah.</span> <span id="s66">So...</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q:Did you go to Hebrew school, or a Sunday School?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A:No, because in Europe that was a little different.</span> <span id="s69">You did not have, the community didn’t support a synagogue.</span> <span id="s70">You paid the taxes.</span> <span id="s71">Now every religious group was taxed, so we had a Jewish tax.</span> <span id="s72">And that, thus the synagogues were supported, or any religious institution.</span> <span id="s73">And a fund drive.</span> <span id="s74">But in the public schools, you had your religious instruction always, which meant you had it three times a week, the first hour of the day.</span> <span id="s75">And it was a pretty, well, for the Jewish people the rabbi or the Hebrew instruction; the Catholic, the nuns came in.</span> <span id="s76">And the Protestants.</span> <span id="s77">And the one who were non-believer, they go to school an hour or two hours later.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q:I see.</span> <span id="s79">And your brother also had this kind of religious education?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A:Yeah, we all did.</span> <span id="s81">We were, yeah, we went to a regular public school before the “Jewish question” arose.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q:And what do you remember of your relations with non-Jewish children in the school?</span> <span id="s83">Did you feel...</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A:No different, no.</span> <span id="s85">No different, when I was in elementary school.</span> <span id="s86">But from fifth grade on, when I had to go to another school, and probably met diversified people, as a child I remember I always was told if somebody called me a “dirty Jew” or another word, don’t say anything.</span> <span id="s87">Don’t make waves.</span> <span id="s88">Take it.</span> <span id="s89">O.K.?</span> <span id="s90">And if somebody spilled ink on you or put your pigtails into the inkwell behind you because you were maybe Jewish, maybe they did to the other, but because we’re Jewish, don’t speak up.</span> <span id="s91">Don’t say anything.</span> <span id="s92">Take it.</span> <span id="s93">You know, O.K., don’t make waves.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q:Were there such anti-Jewish episodes from time to time?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A:I really cannot recall.</span> <span id="s96">I mean, it was sort of, maybe, I don’t know, maybe we developed an immunity towards being called a “dirty Jew.”</span> <span id="s97">I do not recall that somebody would personally accost me or be vengeful to me because I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s98">I cannot recall that at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q:And you had some non-Jewish playmates, I suppose?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A:Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s101">School was all right, as I said.</span> <span id="s102">We had Catholic, Protestant, and Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q:And in the fifth grade something happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A:The fifth grade, then you moved to different schools and like here you move to high school.</span> <span id="s105">You move to a different school as you pass an exam and could go to a different school.</span> <span id="s106">And it wasn’t too bad because then I went to a French school, a completely French schools, where all the subjects were taught in French.</span> <span id="s107">And this was outside of my neighborhood.</span> <span id="s108">And I really do not recall in school being very much abused of being Jewish...</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q:There weren’t many...</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A:At all.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q:Jewish children in such a school, I would suppose.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A:Yes, there were.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q:There were.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A:Many Jewish and...</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q:French rather than German was the preferred language for upper...</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A:No...</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q:Class?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A:German was.</span> <span id="s119">No we had...</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q:German.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A:Always all the Jewish families read a German-Jewish newspaper, which was published in Vienna and was called Prager Tageblatt.</span> <span id="s122">Maybe it was, or maybe it was published in Prague.</span> <span id="s123">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s124">But that was read.</span> <span id="s125">We always, always had a German-speaking maid, a governess.</span> <span id="s126">So we had been brought up bi-lingually, and eventually tri-lingual.</span> <span id="s127">Don’t forget that my parents actually were the first generation of Czechoslovakia before that it was the Austrian Empire, the Hungro-Austrian [Austro-Hungarian] Empire.</span> <span id="s128">And the official language, the official language, was German, for the official papers.</span> <span id="s129">So everybody spoke German rather than Yiddish.</span> <span id="s130">I never spoke Yiddish until I came to the States.</span> <span id="s131">That’s where I learned it.</span> <span id="s132">So, no, I..</span> <span id="s133">.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q:But the interest in French was cultural?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A:The French was, you know, toi toi, upper class.</span> <span id="s136">We were...</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q:The language of diplomacy...</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A:Yeah, diplomacy, yeah.</span> <span id="s139">And so and so, you, from fifth grade on I met some pretty nice people, pretty nice kids.</span> <span id="s140">And I don’t, O.K., so, I got myself very much involved in the Zionistic Youth Movement, when I was like ten.</span> <span id="s141">And thanks to that I really am here.</span> <span id="s142">But I was very much involved in that always after school and learning through Maccabi Hatzair which it was called.</span> <span id="s143">And we were learning Hebrew and singing all these Palestine—it was Palestine, not Israel, at that time—and so we were...</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q:Do you remember what attracted you to the movement, Hanna?</span> <span id="s145">Was there an inspiring leader or...</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A:Well, it was the way, O.K., when you, like in school you didn’t have sports.</span> <span id="s147">So of course your parents always looked out that their children should not just develop the brain but also the brawn.</span> <span id="s148">And there was a sports organization in Czech which was called Sokol, S-O-K-O-L, who did not accept Jews, like the country clubs here.</span> <span id="s149">But the Jewish people had their own gyms, and that was called Maccabi.</span> <span id="s150">And we used to go there after school two, three times.</span> <span id="s151">Red, whit-, blue and white shorts we used to wear.</span> <span id="s152">And I think through that, I really don’t know how I got into it.</span> <span id="s153">It seems like I’ve been it all my life.</span> <span id="s154">Through that, I think there was an outing or something like that.</span> <span id="s155">And I got caught up...</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q:You were caught up in the...</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A:Caught up in it, and I went to camp and had very that pioneer spirit.</span> <span id="s158">And hashachar [prepatory camp].</span> <span id="s159">We were, we slept on the floor and ate from the same pot for five weeks and...</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q:Real chalutzot.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A:Yeah!</span> <span id="s162">Anachnu chalutzim [we are pioneers], all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A:And I stuck with this.</span> <span id="s165">And my parents were very unhappy about that...</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q:I was going to ask.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A:At that time, extremely.</span> <span id="s168">And every time, “Where are you going?”</span> <span id="s169">“I’m going to a meeting here and there.”</span> <span id="s170">And, “Who is going to be there?”</span> <span id="s171">The first time I really broke loose and...</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q:They were not Zionists?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A:They were not Zionists.</span> <span id="s174">They were very, they didn’t give me too much, at least, maybe I was so caught up in it that I didn’t pay that much attention how heart-broken they were.</span> <span id="s175">But they were certainly not very supportive, and did not...</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q:And your brother, did they, did he...</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A:My brother was four years younger than I, so when I was ten, he was six.</span> <span id="s178">So it really didn’t matter that much to him.</span> <span id="s179">But...</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q:This was very meaningful for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A:Yeah, I was, I found my niche, finally.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q:And your parents...</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A:And as a matter of fact, most of my friends who survived, who are in Israel, are still from that era.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q:Well, that’s interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A:Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q:[coughs] Excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A:Here’s one [unclear]...</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q:And can you tell me a little about the life of your parents in the pre-war period?</span> <span id="s189">They were comfortable economically and socially?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A:Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q:And happy in their life?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A:I think so.</span> <span id="s193">It’s very difficult to think back what you saw as a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A:I was very happy.</span> <span id="s196">I had...we did a lot of things.</span> <span id="s197">My parents were very sporty, and we went skiing a lot.</span> <span id="s198">In particular my father was into the European football and we used to go to football games, played football.</span> <span id="s199">We rented in the summer, every summer, a summer house.</span> <span id="s200">We took the whole household including the maid to the summer house.</span> <span id="s201">And we were very much into the outdoors.</span> <span id="s202">I..</span> <span id="s203">.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q:What was...</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A:Don’t recall ever, at least I don’t think I recall ever having any serious arguments or disagreement, or hearing any in my house.</span> <span id="s206">Maybe they did it when we were asleep.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q:But it was a serene household?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A:I was, I had a very happy childhood and good relationships.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q:What was Father’s business, Hanna?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A:My father was a doctor.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q:And so his patients were Jewish and non-Jewish, I presume.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A:I do not know.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q:You don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A:That I do not know.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q:And would you know if they had any non-Jewish friends, socially?</span> <span id="s216">You weren’t aware at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A:I recall some dinner parties in the house, but you know, in that time the children were seen but not heard.</span> <span id="s218">And if there was a party for the adults, you just did not mix into that at all.</span> <span id="s219">You said, “Hello, how are you?”</span> <span id="s220">And, “Goodnight,” and say, “Hello,” and shake hands and make a curtsy and go away.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q:Can you tell me a little about the neighborhood where you lived?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A:We lived in, actually across a church, but within the boundaries of, where they call it the Alt-Neu Synagogue, the old-new synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q:Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A:Could walk it right across a main street there.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A:So with, from our windows there was a church, but it was, I think it was sort of mixed.</span> <span id="s227">Maybe the half a street later was practically all Jewish.</span> <span id="s228">When we, we lived in an apartment house and we had a maid who lived in.</span> <span id="s229">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q:And you could walk to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A:To elementary school, but to the, from fifth grade on to the French school I had to either take a streetcar.</span> <span id="s232">Or, if I wanted to save money, I walked it, which was about an hour’s walk.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q:And what year are we speaking about?</span> <span id="s234">When did you enter the French school, approximately?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A:‘35, ‘36.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q:‘36.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A:‘36.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q:And you were then about 11?</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A:Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q:And so...</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A:I stayed only two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q:Two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A:Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q:And what happened at the end of that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A:Well then...you know, is this, now you come to, two years later you come into ‘38...</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q:‘38.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A:Which was, of course the Sudetenland was...</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q:The Sudetenland.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A:Occupied, and...</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q:How did that affect your family or your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A:I think it did.</span> <span id="s252">I think, first of all, I think it affected it before because we had an aunt who was in Vienna.</span> <span id="s253">And they came to live with us.</span> <span id="s254">They escaped from Vienna and so then we were like, you know, two families in one apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q:I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A:Also, it started affecting us long before that, because the maid just left.</span> <span id="s257">O.K., well, we were told as kids that we are big enough.</span> <span id="s258">We don’t need a maid.</span> <span id="s259">But...</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q:There were other factors, undoubtedly.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A:Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s262">But there was, and so my aunt, Helena, with her family, they came from Vienna and they were telling us how things are.</span> <span id="s263">And of course everybody was saying, “That can happen in Austria but never, never in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s264">We are a democracy.</span> <span id="s265">We have a democratic president, and this will not happen.”</span> <span id="s266">But I, there were a lot of people coming, particular, I think, I don’t know, because I didn’t live anywhere else, but I thought that in our neighborhood there were a lot of strange Jewish people coming in suddenly.</span> <span id="s267">And so then the streets...</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q:Immigrants.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A:Were more crowded.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A:What happened in the other neighborhood, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s272">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q:They were coming mostly from Austria, do you suppose?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A:Austria.</span> <span id="s275">A lot of people came from Poland also.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q:From Poland also.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A:Yeah, many.</span> <span id="s278">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q:So you were aware of...</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A:What is the question?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q:What happened in the French school?</span> <span id="s282">And you were saying that in the middle ‘30s...</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A:Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s284">So then of course...</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q:That it really was changing.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A:Yeah, and you also asked how, and then of course when the Sudetenland was occupied and there was a general mobilization, and we had to leave.</span> <span id="s287">I mean, I don’t know, under Czechoslovakia there was a mobilization in ‘38.</span> <span id="s288">And we had to go to the country.</span> <span id="s289">They thought that the city is going to be bombed.</span> <span id="s290">And what affected us also that we, all kids, we had to walk with gas masks.</span> <span id="s291">Everybody had to buy a gas mask.</span> <span id="s292">But that’s not a “Jewish question.”</span> <span id="s293">It was just a question that the war is coming on, and we had all these exercises, you know, the gas alarms instead of fire alarm exercise.</span> <span id="s294">And so then we put on the gas mask on and how to go under the desks in the classroom and all that thing.</span> <span id="s295">But as far as the “Jewish question” was, was that in 1938 the Jews were not allowed to go to public schools any more.</span> <span id="s296">There was a decree that you cannot attend the school any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q:This was a Czech government decree?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A:No.</span> <span id="s299">I might be wrong, but...</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q:Maybe it’s...</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A:In 19-...</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q:‘39.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A:19-, March, 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q:Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A:March 1939, where we were occupied in what became Protectorate Bohemia-Moravia.</span> <span id="s306">And the decree was pretty soon after that that the Jews cannot attend schools.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q:That was after the destruction of the Republic...</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A:Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q:Actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A:Yeah.</span> <span id="s311">But the mobilization was ‘38.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q:‘38.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A:In September.</span> <span id="s314">And it was March ‘39...</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q:And Father was involved in that mobilization?</span> <span id="s316">You don’t remember.</span> <span id="s317">And when you say you were in...</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A:No, I think...I remember that just the kids and my mother, we just wandered out of the city and...</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q:Into the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A:Into the countryside, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q:And then between September ‘38, the time of Munich, and March ‘39 when the Republic was destroyed, there was...</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A:A lot of things were brewing...</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q:Melting...</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A:A lot of things were happening.</span> <span id="s325">For my part, you know, in the Zionistic organization, we got a lot of shaliach [emissary from Israel] came from Palestine and was telling us what’s going to happen.</span> <span id="s326">And I came home and I, my parents were saying, “It’s a lot of propaganda,” you know.</span> <span id="s327">“They all want you to go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s328">They...it’s nothing is going to happen.</span> <span id="s329">They just are painting the whole thing black in order to get the young people into Palestine and...”</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q:Did you want to go at that time, Hanna?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A:Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q:You did.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A:Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q:Did any of your friends go?</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A:All my, no, not directly, no.</span> <span id="s336">Because first we had to go, like we had a certain camp, like a summer camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q:Hachsharah.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A:A Hachsharah camp, like my kids were in Young Judea Camp.</span> <span id="s339">And so you had to go through the training and in 1938 I went to a camp.</span> <span id="s340">My parents let me go.</span> <span id="s341">And summer 19-, yeah, 1938, yeah... I’m really not prepared.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q:That’s all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A:1937, 1938 I went to the camp where we were, lived, chalutz life.</span> <span id="s344">I loved it.</span> <span id="s345">It was great.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q:And you really were getting yourself ready to go to Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A:Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s348">I learned Hebrew and...</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q:You learned Hebrew.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A:I learned Hebrew and we studied constantly Hebrew.</span> <span id="s351">And we studied the whole political situation, to the chagrin of my parents, instead of studying the French.</span> <span id="s352">And in 1939...</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q:[coughs] Excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A:Summer, O.K., now, the Protektorat became March.</span> <span id="s355">I still went to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q:That’s ‘39.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A:‘39, until May.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q:Until May.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A:And ‘39, in May, I came to school.</span> <span id="s360">Now, excuse me, that’s all wrong.</span> <span id="s361">In 1939, in March, April...</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q:April.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A:I went to school.</span> <span id="s364">And I get to school, and the whole school is full of German troops.</span> <span id="s365">They eliminated a French school.</span> <span id="s366">And they used it as the headquarters as the [unclear].</span> <span id="s367">So we all we sent home, but not by the virtue of being Jewish.</span> <span id="s368">At the time that French school was, there was also an English school and that German Army took...on.</span> <span id="s369">And they said that we are going to have classrooms somewhere else.</span> <span id="s370">That then happened except for the Jewish students.</span> <span id="s371">The Jewish student could not attend.</span> <span id="s372">I really do not know where the classrooms, where the classes were held.</span> <span id="s373">The school, the physical school, was occupied by the German Army.</span> <span id="s374">We got there one day and that was it.</span> <span id="s375">And we were sent home.</span> <span id="s376">And as a matter of fact, I do have sort of like a paper here where it says the school has been dissolved.</span> <span id="s377">But apparently there were still some classes somewhere else.</span> <span id="s378">But then it was that the Jewish people would not go, could not go.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q:To any public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A:To any public school, but there was a Jewish school.</span> <span id="s381">There was a Jewish school which was started which apparently was, of course I have some people now an age who remember, you know, who taught there.</span> <span id="s382">They were young women of 17 or 18 who became teachers, and there was established a Jewish group for Jewish children.</span> <span id="s383">I..</span> <span id="s384">.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q:You attended that?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A:Did not attend that...</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q:No.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A:Because this was April, and I didn’t want to go.</span> <span id="s389">I just was going to the Zionistic movement and I was saying that I’m going to go in September to school in aliyah, ‘39, September, ‘39.</span> <span id="s390">But then I started being very active in the Maccabi Hatzair and still wanted to organize a summer camp, which we did, in 1939.</span> <span id="s391">So I never went, except that we used to get together and just learn.</span> <span id="s392">But I didn’t go into any...</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q:Formal.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A:Official, formal school, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q:And what was happening to Brother?</span> <span id="s396">What is your brother’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A:My brother’s name was Peter.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q:Peter.</span> <span id="s399">And what was happening to his life during this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A:His, well, his life was...I like to think, I’m not sure, but I like to think that he was extremely brilliant.</span> <span id="s401">He was, because he wrote a lot of poetry when he was even like ten, eleven years old.</span> <span id="s402">He drew beautifully.</span> <span id="s403">He drew beautiful cartoons.</span> <span id="s404">He was...</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q:Talented.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A:Very talented.</span> <span id="s407">And he went to a Jewish school.</span> <span id="s408">He hated it.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q:He was not interested in those things?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A:Oh no.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q:Or was he...</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A:No, he just, I think that he was, he hated that he had to get out of his school and go into that...</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q:Which he had loved.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A:Which he had loved.</span> <span id="s415">And to go to a Jewish school.</span> <span id="s416">And he started going for the small children into the Maccabi Hatzair, in that tzophim [scout movement].</span> <span id="s417">And it’s funny because my daughter now is the regional director for Zionistic movement.</span> <span id="s418">So I always keep telling them I brought them a, their career, made a career out of that.</span> <span id="s419">So I pursued this all my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q:Yes.</span> <span id="s421">Did he...</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A:He was much more...</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q:Adjust, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A:He was much more, he could find happiness sort of within himself.</span> <span id="s425">He did a lot of writing and poetry.</span> <span id="s426">And so and so.</span> <span id="s427">He could, he was schlepping along as my younger brother.</span> <span id="s428">[tape off then on] Oh, what was the question?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q:About your brother and his writing.</span> <span id="s430">He started a newspaper?</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A:He started a newspaper for the Maccabi Hatzair, Zionistic movement, and he attended the Jewish school then.</span> <span id="s432">How it affected him emotionally, I really didn’t find out until sort of later, when I was in Denmark.</span> <span id="s433">[unclear] And my parents, I remember there were sort of like a lot of clandestine meetings in our house.</span> <span id="s434">I think they were trying to get to Uganda.</span> <span id="s435">I remember studying about Uganda in that time, because we had relatives in Cincinnati, Ohio—that’s how I came after the war to America—who they tried to get, you know, papers and get to America and get a visa here and get a affidavit to here.</span> <span id="s436">But nothing was moving out of America.</span> <span id="s437">Papers were not coming and...</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q:Very few Czech Jews were able to come to this country.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A:I do not know.</span> <span id="s440">I cannot really answer that.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q:It’s my...yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A:All I can answer is for my own family.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q:Were they thinking of Palestine as an alternative, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A:I cannot answer that, in all honesty either.</span> <span id="s445">I know there was a lot of talk about Uganda.</span> <span id="s446">We had to study Uganda because they were accepting Jews there at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q:Is that so?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A:Of all places!</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A:I remember because that was such a strange name for me, you know, Uganda.</span> <span id="s451">We kept saying it over and over and again, and looked it up.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q:Do you know the British had offered it to Jews in 1905?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A:Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q:And so this was a revival of the idea, possibly.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A:And then, of course, my grandmother had a sister here in Cincinnati, Ohio.</span> <span id="s456">So they were trying to get here, and get their papers here.</span> <span id="s457">But the wheels were just grinding too slow to save many people that way, as far as papers forged, I mean, from here.</span> <span id="s458">The affidavits and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q:Was Father’s business practice affected, after March ‘39?</span> <span id="s460">Was he able to practice?</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A:Not too, not too, not too, not yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q:Not yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A:No.</span> <span id="s464">Not...</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q:And were you aware that Jewish stores were being closed or taken over?</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A:Oh yes, oh yes, oh yeah, well, we wore the star and all that stuff, you know, we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q:As early as March?</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A:No, not as early as March.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q:A little later.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A:It was June...</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q:June ‘39.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A:Yeah, we wore the stars, and the stores had, you know, “This is a Jewish store,” the store, Juden Gesch@ft.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q:But Jews were still able to operate their stores, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A:Yeah, except that they were not allowed to have any Gentile employees.</span> <span id="s475">Also, our ration cards were different.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q:Was there curfew, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A:There was a curfew, but it was not steady.</span> <span id="s478">It would be like one week it was here and the next week there wouldn’t be a curfew.</span> <span id="s479">It was sort of...</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q:Erratic.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A:And there were the fancy strikes, like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q:Do you remember that your relations with non-Jewish children, or friends, were affected, Hanna?</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A:Yeah.</span> <span id="s484">Well, I don’t know whether they were affected.</span> <span id="s485">I think that we started to stick more to ourselves.</span> <span id="s486">You sort of, it was sort of like a natural progression that we started to sever all your relationship with the non-Jewish people, non-Jewish play-, well, they were not playmates any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q:Friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A:Friends, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q:But...</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A:And you sort of gravitated more towards your own at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q:But your parents were still able to keep their apartment...</span></p> <p><span id="s492">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q:Through the fall of ‘39?</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A:Oh yeah, right.</span> <span id="s495">After I left they still had their apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q:And so you stayed in Prague until when, Hanna?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A:October, ‘39.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q:And then what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A:I went to Denmark.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q:Why Denmark?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A:Well, you see, that’s, actually, what happened was that in, let me see, in the summer of ‘39, I still went to camp, to the Maccabi Hatzair camp, and came back.</span> <span id="s502">In any camp we sort of came back and...</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q:Had Denmark been...</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A:Started to think about emigration.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q:Had Denmark been discussed there as a transit...</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A:No.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q:No?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A:No.</span> <span id="s509">Because we were in Hachsharah, and because we were going to Palestine, we had to learn farming, O.K.?</span> <span id="s510">And the League for Peace and Freedom, the International League for Peace and Freedom put in that they are going to take a certain amount of children between the age of 12 and 15 into Denmark to teach them farming.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q:I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A:And that’s how we got to Denmark in...</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q:This was not connected to any Zionist movement, then, but quite independent.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A:No, I, it was in a way, because the Zionist movement submitted the list to the League of Peace and Freedom, which would not take just any children.</span> <span id="s515">It was more- Tape 1 of 3, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q:Tape one, side two, continuing our interview with Mrs. Hanna Seckel.</span> <span id="s517">[coughs] Excuse me.</span> <span id="s518">Hanna, I was asking about the League, this association that sponsored the agricultural training program.</span> <span id="s519">I asked if it was linked in any way with the Zionist movement.</span> <span id="s520">And you, I think you said that...</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A:Well the League itself wasn’t, but the League did fight against any kind of persecution.</span> <span id="s522">And they did say that they would accommodate so and so many young people.</span> <span id="s523">They used to call them children—it was like a Kinder aliyah [children’s immigration]—and to train them in Denmark in agriculture and farming.</span> <span id="s524">And it probably, the League, the Danish League for Peace and Freedom did contact the undercover Zionistic organizations because they didn’t exist, sort of.</span> <span id="s525">And they in turn contacted us youngsters who were there.</span> <span id="s526">But there was a price to be paid for that later.</span> <span id="s527">You know, you had to buy yourself out, or buy yourself into Denmark, or buy yourself out of Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s528">And it was really up to the parents of the children whether they could afford to pay for this expensive emigration.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q:And your parents, then, were required to pay the League for this so privileged...</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A:I really, I cannot answer whether it was the League or whether it was also partially supporting the Zionistic organization.</span> <span id="s531">But I know there was a high price to be paid for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q:And your parents paid it, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q:Were many other Jewish families involved in this, do you know, Hanna?</span> <span id="s535">Or was it too expensive?</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A:Well, we were, there were three transports going.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q:In ‘39.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A:In ‘39, to Denmark.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q:And about how many...</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A:And there were transports also going from Germany at this time.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q:And about how many children in each of the three transports?</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A:There were about close to 100.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q:Close to a hundred.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q:And your brother, was he interested?</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A:He was.</span> <span id="s547">He was too young.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q:He was too young.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A:He couldn’t go.</span> <span id="s550">There was a specific, I just was lucky.</span> <span id="s551">I fell into the age requirement at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q:So you left in October.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A:I left in October of ‘39.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q:It must have been a wrenching separation from your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A:Well, you know, looking back and being in a old, for me it was a fantastic adventure.</span> <span id="s556">And on looking back, I, many, many times in my life I said, “How selfish was I, and not...”</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q:But you were young.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A:Well I, and, it took me years before I even could even think about how my parents must have felt about that.</span> <span id="s559">It took me years even wanted to see the picture of my parents on the platform, on the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q:But you had no idea a war was coming, or that you’d be separated, did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A:Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q:You knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A:The war broke out, we left after the war broke out.</span> <span id="s564">We left in the end of October.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q:Ah yes, of, Poland was invaded, of course, in September.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A:Yeah.</span> <span id="s567">Oh yes, but things were going really bad, and we knew they are not going to get any better.</span> <span id="s568">And, you know, yet...</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q:But for you, going to Denmark...</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A:But for me...</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q:Was...</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A:Well, I was on my own.</span> <span id="s573">I was just 14.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q:14.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A:And we sat on the train and we sang Hebrew songs and going through Berlin and we were in this compartment, all closed in.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q:It was an intense experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A:I was in love with somebody and he was on the train and...then, you know, you got there, and you broke down.</span> <span id="s578">But...</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q:Were you able to maintain contact with your parents by mail?</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A:Mmm hmm.</span> <span id="s581">Because then in April Denmark was occupied.</span> <span id="s582">And so then we became the Grosses Deutsches Reich and so there was constant mail contact.</span> <span id="s583">And I still have all my letters.</span> <span id="s584">And when I came home I, after the war, I found all of my letters that I had sent it home.</span> <span id="s585">And I still have it.</span> <span id="s586">It’s all yellow and so on, but I have every single letter which we had, and which we corresponded.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q:Where...in Denmark did you stay when you got there?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A:Well...</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q:Were you taken to a farm?</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A:We were taken to a farm.</span> <span id="s591">Do you want to see a picture?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q:Of course.</span> <span id="s593">If...we could do that a little later.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A:Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q:Where in Denmark?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A:Görløse, per Görløse, G-O-R-L-O-S-E, and it’s a umlaut O, per, P-E-R, small p-e-r, it means like post office.</span> <span id="s597">And the same thing, Görløse.</span> <span id="s598">And that farm was an unusual Danish farm because there was neither running water nor electricity.</span> <span id="s599">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q:Was it near any city or town?</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A:It was near Hillrøb.</span> <span id="s602">And that was the closest place.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q:Can you spell that?</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A:H-I-L-L-R-Ø-B, umlaut O. And the Danes put like a slash through the O.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q:No running water?</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A:No running water, no electricity.</span> <span id="s607">And no, nothing but Danish spoken, no other language.</span> <span id="s608">I was...</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q:Were you with your comrades?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A:No, the thing is that somehow it happened that two of us, a boy who is now in Denmark, stayed in Denmark, and I, we were shipped into this little village.</span> <span id="s611">Now he was a little luckier than I, because he was shipped to a school teacher.</span> <span id="s612">We were met at the train, the two of us, by a priest, when we came from Copenhagen to Görløse, by a priest and a schoolteacher.</span> <span id="s613">They came to meet us at the train, in their...</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q:Regalia?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A:Regalia, right.</span> <span id="s616">And he stayed with the school teacher, whereas I was, I don’t remember if I was driven by horse, cart, to the farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q:To the priest’s farm?</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A:No.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q:No.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A:To another farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q:To another farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A:And they had four children, and they needed a maid.</span> <span id="s623">And here I was put into the position of being the helper.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q:And what happened to the other children in the transport?</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A:The boy, the other children went to another village.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q:Were they all scattered, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A:We were all scattered, yeah, each one.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q:All scattered.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A:All scattered.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q:I see.</span> <span id="s631">Of course this is not what you had in mind when you left.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">A:No.</span> <span id="s633">No, we were all scattered.</span> <span id="s634">It’s, actually under, in Copenhagen the representative, Mrs. Nielson, Frau Nielson...she met us and she, and we were running with those signs.</span> <span id="s635">And this one goes this way and this one goes this way and...</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q:I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A:So, but the two of us were the only ones who went from this train to the town.</span> <span id="s638">And the other ones went to another town, which was called Nostved.</span> <span id="s639">But they were sort of closer together.</span> <span id="s640">But this boy and I, we, at the time we thought it was far away.</span> <span id="s641">When I came back it wasn’t really that far away, but we thought it was far, far away.</span> <span id="s642">And there were just the two of us, trying contact.</span> <span id="s643">They did have a phone, though, which you cranked up by hand and called the operator.</span> <span id="s644">But...</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q:But you knew no Danish.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A:I didn’t know Danish.</span> <span id="s647">And the winter was extremely severe.</span> <span id="s648">The snow drifts were extremely severe.</span> <span id="s649">And I..</span> <span id="s650">.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q:It must have been a shocking experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A:It was a shock, it was, it was.</span> <span id="s653">Yeah, I had a completely unheated room, sort of outside.</span> <span id="s654">And I did all the farm chores and going, pump the water in the morning, from the pump, which was absolutely frozen.</span> <span id="s655">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q:Frozen.</span> <span id="s657">Did you have any warm clothing for that?</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s659">We were allowed to take like 50 kilograms with us, and well...we didn’t have any boots or anything like that.</span> <span id="s660">So we always had to write to the League and ask for boots.</span> <span id="s661">But they sort of collected clothing for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q:Did some representative come from time to time...</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A:Once in a while they should come.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q:To see how you were faring?</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A:And there was a Frau Openheimer.</span> <span id="s666">I remember her name.</span> <span id="s667">She came, but we always used to make fun of her, us kids, because she never did anything for us.</span> <span id="s668">You know, she would put down our name and say, she’d say, “I’ll send you a pair of boots.”</span> <span id="s669">But she didn’t.</span> <span id="s670">So, we had these wooden shoes.</span> <span id="s671">And we stuffed them with straw to keep them warm.</span> <span id="s672">And the farmer, I think the farmers was pretty much disillusioned with me, because I really did not know anything and did not know any farming.</span> <span id="s673">And in the morning you had to cook this oatmeal porridge.</span> <span id="s674">And I, in the beginning I did not know how to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q:Coming from an upper-class...</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A:Pumping the water, and then boiling the water and, or, in the morning you got up.</span> <span id="s677">Or you pumped the water in the evening, and so you could have water for cooking in the morning.</span> <span id="s678">And you would start your fire in the morning in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s679">But the water was, even in the kitchen, it was frozen deep.</span> <span id="s680">And so you had to hack that ice.</span> <span id="s681">And it was pretty cold.</span> <span id="s682">My room was so cold that like in the morning my sheets were frozen from my breath.</span> <span id="s683">My blankets were frozen.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q:Good heavens.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A:And so...</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q:You were in the main house, or in a barn?</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A:Well, I was not in the main house.</span> <span id="s688">And I was not in the barn.</span> <span id="s689">I was like in the servants’ quarters, which were not heated.</span> <span id="s690">Actually, the house wasn’t heated either, because you just kindled your fires...</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q:For each individual room.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A:For each individual room.</span> <span id="s693">Or you took a brick and stuck them in the stove and then...</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q:Took it to bed.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A:Took it...to bed, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q:Did you get enough to eat?</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A:Yeah.</span> <span id="s698">Oh yeah, I got fat.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q:And how did you withstand the cold?</span> <span id="s700">Or did you come down with colds that first winter?</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A:I..</span> <span id="s702">.</span> <span id="s703">withstood it, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q:You withstood it.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A:I withstood it, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q:And were they relatively kindly people or...</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A:I can’t tell, because we could not communicate at all.</span> <span id="s708">I..</span> <span id="s709">.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Q:You didn’t learn much Danish, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A:Yeah, well, of course.</span> <span id="s712">You do start learning.</span> <span id="s713">Eventually I went to school in Denmark, in that...</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q:But those first...</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A:Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q:Few months must have been very tough.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A:But, it was very hard.</span> <span id="s718">I cried many a tear.</span> <span id="s719">I didn’t want to write home any letters.</span> <span id="s720">Everything was fine when I wrote home because I know they had more than their share and they wanted me, they were happy that I was out of that situation.</span> <span id="s721">Until April of ‘40.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q:Did you hear, then, from your parents?</span> <span id="s723">The mail got through.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A:The mail got through.</span> <span id="s725">As a matter of fact, my parents were so that they sent that farmer also some presents for Yule, which is Christmas in Danish.</span> <span id="s726">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q:What did they write about their situation?</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A:Well, most of the letters were censored.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q:So they couldn’t say much?</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A:My brother, who did a very good cartoon at that time, and sort of enclosed cartoons in that, which I still do have.</span> <span id="s731">And so I could, you know...</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q:What were your parents writing?</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A:Well, you know...</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q:Just that they were all right?</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A:It’s an odd thing, because, or maybe it’s not, because it took me I would say a good 30 years before I even started to reread the letters.</span> <span id="s736">I just didn’t want to.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q:I can understand that.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A:And [pause; HS was pained to recall this].</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q:We’ll pass on that.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">A:The situation was so that, you know, this was taken, that was taken.</span> <span id="s741">And the jewelry was taken and they could go out on the street only such and such hours.</span> <span id="s742">And the ration cards were taken and then three families and four families and five families moved into our apartment, into the concentrated ghetto.</span> <span id="s743">And about the selections.</span> <span id="s744">This one was selected to go, and these ones were selected to go.</span> <span id="s745">And this family isn’t here any more.</span> <span id="s746">And if the family wasn’t, the family moved, you knew where they moved to, because you knew they couldn’t get out of the country.</span> <span id="s747">So the only way they could move to was into the cattle car.</span> <span id="s748">So...</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q:And...</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A:Yes, but...</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q:Were you in touch...</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A:Then...</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Q:With some of your own, excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">A:Yeah.</span> <span id="s755">April, ‘40, Denmark was occupied.</span> <span id="s756">O.K. And...</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q:How did that affect your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s758">A:In the beginning, terribly.</span> <span id="s759">But you learn to live with any situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q:Were you allowed to stay in the farm?</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A:The...I recall this quite vividly.</span> <span id="s762">Suddenly one morning, there’s a whole German Army marching through the field into that farm, a cavalry, on horses.</span> <span id="s763">And they settled themselves down in the barn.</span> <span id="s764">Now the, and I crawled under the bed.</span> <span id="s765">[chuckles] Not literally, but I just didn’t want to get out of my room.</span> <span id="s766">The farmer knew that I speak German, and he wanted me out there to communicate with the German soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Q:He knew of course that you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s768">A:Yeah, but I don’t think that ever was a question.</span> <span id="s769">You know, before WWII, there, except for the White Russians, who came through, Denmark, there was no Jewish question.</span> <span id="s770">The Danes are not very religious oriented.</span> <span id="s771">They are all more or less Lutheran.</span> <span id="s772">They go to church once a year on Christmas.</span> <span id="s773">And there was no...</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A:Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q:Very little anti-Semitism.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A:Particularly in the farms, or in the, in Copenhagen there was a synagogue, which I did not know until much, much later.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q:But there was really no Jewish problem in Denmark?</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A:No, they just probably found out, you know, the Danes at that time, are very good-natured people.</span> <span id="s780">So they just felt sorry and they took us.</span> <span id="s781">And, not only that but, you know, we were a helping hand.</span> <span id="s782">I mean, we didn’t get paid.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q:You didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A:No, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q:Just your board and keep?</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A:Yeah, as a matter of fact we didn’t even have money for stamps, you know, to send letters.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q:You had to get that from your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A:Yeah, they used to send this International Reply Card where you could go to the, you know, you can go to the post office and change it for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A:No, we didn’t...no, no money, no money whatsoever.</span> <span id="s791">I mean really no money.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q:Was this considered a fairly prosperous farm?</span></p> <p><span id="s793">A:No.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q:No.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A:I don’t think so because...</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q:Hard working.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A:I..</span> <span id="s798">.</span> <span id="s799">didn’t stay there, I stayed there one term through June.</span> <span id="s800">And then I moved to another farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q:Now I interrupted you.</span> <span id="s802">You were about to say the farmer wanted you to speak to the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">A:Yeah.</span> <span id="s804">And I said, “No.”</span> <span id="s805">I didn’t want to do that.</span> <span id="s806">Well, you see, it was very, for the farmer it was very advantageous, because the German would pay a lot, and it was, you know, the farmer did not know their money was worth nothing.</span> <span id="s807">But they printed their money like crazy, and they would pay three times, four times the market price of anything which they wanted.</span> <span id="s808">They didn’t, they did not take it.</span> <span id="s809">They would pay for it with their Deutsche Reichs Marks.</span> <span id="s810">And it was a very nice thing for the farmer to do.</span> <span id="s811">And I would not go there.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q:So how did he negotiate?</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A:And so he called, how did he negotiate?</span> <span id="s814">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s815">He called the school teacher where this other boy, the boy was in, and he complained to him that, you know, that, about that he asked me to do it and I do not want to do that.</span> <span id="s816">They, the Germans stayed on the farm I think like one week, and then they moved on.</span> <span id="s817">They supplied their horses and they supplied themselves with their, we slaughtered a lot of pigs at that farm, which I learned how to do too, and make sausages, which I learned how to do.</span> <span id="s818">And they took a lot of hay for their horses, and then they moved on.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">Q:They didn’t molest you or the farm family?</span></p> <p><span id="s820">A:No.</span> <span id="s821">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q:How did you get on with the children?</span></p> <p><span id="s823">A:They thought that I was unique, crazy, different, which I was.</span> <span id="s824">But I got along fine, because... Would you believe, this was my first Christmas present from the farmer in 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q:Oh, oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">A:A silver spoon.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Q:This was their name, Borg?</span></p> <p><span id="s828">A:No, that’s the castle.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q:Oh, that’s the castle, I see, Fredricksborg.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A:Yeah.</span> <span id="s831">Those were hamlets.</span> <span id="s832">[note, original typed MSS said, “It’s from Hamlet.”</span> <span id="s833">???]</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Q:Is that so?</span></p> <p><span id="s835">A:Mmm hmm.</span> <span id="s836">I was right near there, which I did not know at the time.</span> <span id="s837">Well, anyhow, so you cannot move around unless you learn how to ride a bike.</span> <span id="s838">I never knew how to ride a bike, so here they got me an old dilapidated bike and I learned how to ride a bike.</span> <span id="s839">And in the winter, we used to put rope around the tires, instead of snow tires, and I rode the bike that way.</span> <span id="s840">The snow was very, very deep.</span> <span id="s841">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s842">Q:So you stayed with this...</span></p> <p><span id="s843">A:I stayed until May...</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Q:Family until June?</span> <span id="s845">May.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A:Or June, ‘40.</span> <span id="s847">And then I moved to Naestved, where the whole nucleus of the hashachar people...</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q:You did this on your own, Hanna, or were you instructed to do it?</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A:No, no, you see, at that time when you lived on a farm, all the farm help, like the seasonal farm help, was contracted for six months at a time.</span> <span id="s850">So you could only move...</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q:After the contract was...</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A:After the contract.</span> <span id="s853">But...</span></p> <p><span id="s854">Q:Over.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A:Even the contract was a non-paying thing, but you could not move.</span> <span id="s856">And so, we got in touch with some of the kids who were in Naestved and I said, “I would like to go, you know, near you.”</span> <span id="s857">But they...had a pagishot [meeting] and they had a madrich [instructor] who came from, I think he was, he was financed both by the League and by the Zionistic organization, which was extremely, extremely small and extremely poor of funds.</span> <span id="s858">And of course now, don’t forget, it was under German occupation in Denmark.</span> <span id="s859">But they had a madrich who came around to these centers where the kids were, once a week, or you know, twice a month, where we got together to learn something.</span> <span id="s860">It either was math or, very informally, but mostly it was all Zionistic teaching, a lot of Hebrew, and Hebrew conversation.</span> <span id="s861">But we got together, at least.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q:And that must have been such a relief.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A:So I wanted to go there, and I did.</span> <span id="s864">You had to get a permit from the police to move from one place to the other, but I got there.</span> <span id="s865">And then I came to a very nice farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q:In Naestved.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A:In Naestved, yeah, near Naestved.</span> <span id="s868">I had a very good friend, who was not on a farm.</span> <span id="s869">She was sort of like a, she was lucky, she was adopted girl of a music teacher, in Naestved.</span> <span id="s870">And the farm was outside of Naestved.</span> <span id="s871">Of course Naestved is a little town.</span> <span id="s872">And she was, she lived with her family in town.</span> <span id="s873">Oh my God, you know, go to the village, and go to town was really quite a treat.</span> <span id="s874">But the woman, she lived, was a music teacher.</span> <span id="s875">Yeah, anyhow, talking about music, because there was no electricity, there was no radio.</span> <span id="s876">And when I came to Naestved, for the first time in a long time I heard music.</span> <span id="s877">And it was really quite something for me to hear just somebody plinking on the piano.</span> <span id="s878">It was, I envied her that she was there.</span> <span id="s879">And they really liked her because she was not like a maid there.</span> <span id="s880">She was like their adopted daughter, because they didn’t have any children.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">Q:They didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">A:She lives in Canada now.</span> <span id="s883">So, I’m still in touch with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q:So this...new place was quite pleasant?</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A:This was a very nice farm, and...</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q:The work you did was not quite so hard?</span></p> <p><span id="s887">A:Yeah, it was, and then, it was...the same work but...</span></p> <p><span id="s888">Q:The same work.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">A:It, you know, to kindle the fire, to work on the fields, to milk fourteen cows, by hand, in an hour.</span> <span id="s890">That was the goal.</span> <span id="s891">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q:Oh, so it was...</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A:To take care of the chickens.</span> <span id="s894">They had thousands of chickens.</span> <span id="s895">I learned that.</span> <span id="s896">And I think my worst job was always to empty the latrine.</span> <span id="s897">I hated that job!</span></p> <p><span id="s898">Q:It was an outdoor latrine?</span></p> <p><span id="s899">A:Outdoor, yeah, outdoor, like that.</span> <span id="s900">I hated to go there.</span> <span id="s901">Well, you know, people have done worse in concentration camps, my goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Q:But still, you were sixteen.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">A:But in the winter I loved it because it was all frozen, but in the summer I hated it because it was so full and I had to lift it up and it spilled all over the place.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">Q:Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">A:But, I also lived in the servant quarter.</span> <span id="s906">I was, but I ate with the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">Q:And your room was still unheated?</span></p> <p><span id="s908">A:My room was still unheated.</span> <span id="s909">As a matter of fact, that room was even worse because there was a, the wall, the outside wall where it comes together was cracked.</span> <span id="s910">So the cold air [she says “or”] was coming in.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q:The cold air drifted in.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">A:Yeah, it was.</span> <span id="s913">But they...</span></p> <p><span id="s914">Q:But you...</span></p> <p><span id="s915">A:They made me a birthday party, and they invited all the chaverim inside that.</span> <span id="s916">And they were very nice.</span> <span id="s917">They, all kind of...</span></p> <p><span id="s918">Q:Was there electricity and water in this...</span></p> <p><span id="s919">A:Yes, there was electricity and water.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">Q:This was a more modern farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">A:Not warm water but there was water, but not warm water.</span> <span id="s922">We used to wash the clothes.</span> <span id="s923">They had a washing machine which was run by hand.</span> <span id="s924">That was more than on the other farm.</span> <span id="s925">And I remember putting that thing, the clothes in the machine, boiling your water, bringing the water into the machine, and turning the machine by hand.</span> <span id="s926">And I always said after fifteen turns I have to know 15 Hebrew words.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">Q:Aw.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">A:That’s how I..</span> <span id="s929">.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">Q:It was a good routine.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">A:I was learning...Hebrew, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">Q:Yes, an excellent routine.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">A:So, and it was then that I..</span> <span id="s934">.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q:Were there children in this family, Hanna?</span></p> <p><span id="s936">A:There was only, the farmer was a newly wed.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q:I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A:See, on the farms it worked like this.</span> <span id="s939">If you inherit the farm from your parents, your parents stay on the farm.</span> <span id="s940">If you buy a farm, and the people are elderly, they stay on the farm too and they have like their own...</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q:Quarters.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">A:Quarters.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">Q:I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">A:This, their name was Nugord.</span> <span id="s945">He was one of 13 children.</span> <span id="s946">The parents, it was a fantastic family.</span> <span id="s947">His parents were school teachers.</span> <span id="s948">They lived in the schoolhouse.</span> <span id="s949">It was a one-room schoolhouse.</span> <span id="s950">And they kept adopting children all the time.</span> <span id="s951">That was the Finnish-Russian War, and they adopted, the one who had 13 children adopted two other Finnish orphans from the Finnish-Russian War.</span> <span id="s952">So they had, but all the children were from the age 30 to the age 1.</span> <span id="s953">That son was the oldest one, who just got married, and he bought this farm.</span> <span id="s954">So their owner, who also lived on the farm in his quarters on that side, and I lived on the other side.</span> <span id="s955">But they got, they had a baby then, when I was there.</span> <span id="s956">But they were young.</span> <span id="s957">They were like 19, 20 years old, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s958">Q:And you were in touch with your comrades...</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A:Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q:During that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A:Yeah, with the chaverim, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q:And still hearing from your parents, until when?</span></p> <p><span id="s963">A:‘41.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Q:‘41.</span> <span id="s965">And they were still in Prague until ‘41?</span> <span id="s966">What month, Hanna?</span></p> <p><span id="s967">A:September.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">Q:September.</span> <span id="s969">Were you hearing any news about the war...</span></p> <p><span id="s970">A:Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">Q:During this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s972">A:Well you see, they did, the farmers were, well, it’s very interesting, because first there were a lot of pro-German, very much so.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">Q:How do you account for that?</span></p> <p><span id="s974">A:I think they got a lot of money.</span> <span id="s975">Because the British, when they were exporting, like they’re exporting the pork or the bacon or anything to Britain, before the war Britain had very stringent requirements.</span> <span id="s976">And you know, the pig had to be fed to exactly that same weight so the bacon is exactly that way.</span> <span id="s977">And the German took it the way it was and they paid more than the British did.</span> <span id="s978">Now I do not know, at that time, I did not know, at that time, about all the underground which was going on in Denmark.</span> <span id="s979">That I did not know until like ‘42.</span> <span id="s980">I did not know about the sabotages which were done in the big cities.</span> <span id="s981">That I did not know.</span> <span id="s982">I only lived in this little, tiny world.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">Q:Yes.</span> <span id="s984">Your perspective was...</span></p> <p><span id="s985">A:So I, it would be extremely unfair to say to me [for me to say] that all the Danes were pro-Germanic.</span> <span id="s986">All I know is just where I lived, that...</span></p> <p><span id="s987">Q:But culturally there was a closeness, too, I think, between Danes and Germans, prior to the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">A:We didn’t ever meet any adults except the people where we lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">Q:You didn’t get into town very much?</span></p> <p><span id="s990">A:Oh, I got into church on Christmas, you know, to go to the midnight mass.</span> <span id="s991">And oh, we went to a couple of barn dances, where the farm boys came.</span> <span id="s992">But we, and I had no clothes, because I started developing.</span> <span id="s993">I developed very fast and I used to run with safety pins all around because I had no clothes, no clothes at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">Q:And so you stayed on this farm until when?</span></p> <p><span id="s995">A:You see, I was very hungry, I think we all were, for some kind of education.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">Q:Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">A:We were, at that time I spoke Danish.</span> <span id="s998">I wrote Danish.</span> <span id="s999">And so...</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Q:You just picked that up?</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">A:Yeah, where you live, you pick it up.</span> <span id="s1002">And I wanted to, how do you say, better myself, go higher in life.</span> <span id="s1003">And I wanted to do two things: first of all, work as a maid in the city, which I thought I would like to do, and second, I wanted to go to school.</span> <span id="s1004">So, I started, I still wanted to stay within the agricultural field because I was going to Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">Q:That was still your aim?</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">A:Ah yes, we all did.</span> <span id="s1007">But what happened was this, that in 1941 we got—and I do not know from whom; I’d really have to ask my friend in Denmark because he keeps fantastic records of what happened to all of us—that a transport is going to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1008">And they were transporting by 30.</span> <span id="s1009">And we were going to go because we couldn’t go any other way, because the war was going.</span> <span id="s1010">We were going to go to Sweden, to Finland, to Russia, and that way, to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1011">In other words, the eastern way.</span> <span id="s1012">And we got our...</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">Q:Papers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">A:Papers, and a little luggage was sent.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">Q:This was...</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A:And we were going.</span> <span id="s1017">That’s ‘41.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">Q:‘41.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">A:They picked 30 people to go, and one transport went.</span> <span id="s1020">And they got stuck in the Finnish-Russian conflict.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">Q:And had to come back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">A:And they had to come back.</span> <span id="s1023">Some of them- Tape 2 of 3, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">Q:This is tape two, side one, continuing our interview with Mrs. Hanna Seckel.</span> <span id="s1025">Now you were saying this transport was caught in the conflict of the...</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">A:Finnish-Russian War.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">Q:Finnish-Russian War.</span> <span id="s1028">And the transport had to come back...</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A:The Czech transport.</span> <span id="s1030">Some of the people, the German, some of the children from Germany, but they went somewhere else than we were, so I really did not know that at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">Q:Some of the German children, you think, may have gotten through?</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">A:Yeah, they got through.</span> <span id="s1033">And one of my friends got through.</span> <span id="s1034">And he is a big macher now in Israel.</span> <span id="s1035">I got a letter from him from India.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">Q:What a journey that must have been...</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">Q:By way of Russia!</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">A:Yes, yeah, Asiatic Russia and down through Asia at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">Q:My oh my!</span> <span id="s1041">And so you didn’t get onto one of these transports?</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">A:No, the luggage went, but.</span> <span id="s1043">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">Q:The luggage went?</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">A:Yeah, but we didn’t go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">Q:With your small supplies.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">A:Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">Q:So you returned to the farm?</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">A:Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">Q:Now you had talked about schooling.</span> <span id="s1051">Were you in school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">A:So now I started, started doing these things.</span> <span id="s1053">I, you see, on the farm it was like this.</span> <span id="s1054">You had a six month’s contract.</span> <span id="s1055">You only had to stay, you know, it goes from June to November and from November to May, or something like that.</span> <span id="s1056">And this was not just because of us, but all of them were employed that way, on that farm.</span> <span id="s1057">And they would like get paid at the end of the six months’ period.</span> <span id="s1058">So, what my farmer did, he gave me like thirty kroner at the time for the six months.</span> <span id="s1059">And I really wanted to go to school.</span> <span id="s1060">I really wanted to learn.</span> <span id="s1061">So I started to write to different schools, not a school school so to speak, but in Denmark they had these finishing schools.</span> <span id="s1062">I don’t know whether you know what it is.</span> <span id="s1063">It’s a school where girls from better families learn the proper way of housekeeping and entertainment and...</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">Q:Social amenities.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">A:Social things, yes.</span> <span id="s1066">O.K., I think that doesn’t exist any more either.</span> <span id="s1067">But it did exist.</span> <span id="s1068">There were like, and the boys starting to...be itchy also and they started to, wanted to go to agricultural schools.</span> <span id="s1069">And of course, at that time the girls couldn’t get into agricultural schools.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">Q:Not even in Denmark?</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">A:Not even in Denmark.</span> <span id="s1072">But, oh, maybe they could, but we never thought that it was our role to do that.</span> <span id="s1073">It never occurred to us.</span> <span id="s1074">And it just was not how you...</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">Q:No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">A:You were in Europe at all.</span> <span id="s1077">And so I started to write and apply to different schools, which were also around six months’ period, which were like boarding schools.</span> <span id="s1078">You stayed, you learned your nutrition and you learned your dietic, yeah, your...</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">Q:Dietetics.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">A:Dietetics.</span> <span id="s1081">You learned your...</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">Q:Menu making.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">A:Menu making.</span> <span id="s1084">I still have a big Danish cookbook now, which is written by hand.</span> <span id="s1085">And but what I did, I tried to strike a bargain with them.</span> <span id="s1086">I used to write to these schools and tell them that I would be a maid in the school, or a maid to the mistress, the owner of that school, for free tuition.</span> <span id="s1087">And one school, on the whole, did reply, and they told me, “Come on.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">Q:Well...</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">A:So, I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">Q:In one of the larger towns?</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">A:No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">Q:No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">A:No.</span> <span id="s1094">These schools were usually like on a estate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">Q:I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">A:Or ex-estate.</span> <span id="s1097">And, I remember, I took my toothbrush and my knapsack and I took my bicycle and I biked for hours and hours and hours and got to this school.</span> <span id="s1098">And I think that was sort of almost, it was a terrible let-down.</span> <span id="s1099">Because on the farm I was one of them.</span> <span id="s1100">And here on the school I certainly was [not] one of them.</span> <span id="s1101">All of these girls, they were from good families.</span> <span id="s1102">They...were learning how to be mistresses of the houses.</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">Q:Well-dressed, probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">A:Well, we had to wear uniforms during the school hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">Q:I see, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">A:I didn’t have that either.</span> <span id="s1107">And I didn’t have money for textbooks or anything like that.</span> <span id="s1108">I did become a maid to the owner of that school, who was incredible—I will show you pictures later, very interesting—who slept on a high-rise four poster, which were like two steps up, or really like this Queen Mary bed with the curtains all around it.</span> <span id="s1109">And so, I was her chamber maid in that I was emptying her chamber pots and things like that, and doing stuff in her house.</span> <span id="s1110">And I got my tuition free that way.</span> <span id="s1111">I think maybe it was my problem, looking back.</span> <span id="s1112">I thought that everybody hated me, everybody looked down on me.</span> <span id="s1113">I didn’t see any of the chaverim.</span> <span id="s1114">I..</span> <span id="s1115">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">Q:You were isolated from them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">A:Completely, completely isolated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">Q:Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">A:I was the only one who was in a position who didn’t pay tuition, who didn’t have textbooks.</span> <span id="s1120">And I was very unhappy.</span> <span id="s1121">I was extremely unhappy.</span> <span id="s1122">I had no money at all, I mean really, I mean no money.</span> <span id="s1123">And so I used to copy these textbooks and study at night, but then I got up early in the morning to do the housework in her house and then go to classes.</span> <span id="s1124">And [tape off then on]</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">Q:Hanna, what was the attitude of the director of this school toward you?</span> <span id="s1126">Was she...</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">A:Yeah, you see, that’s...</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">Q:At all involved with...</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">A:Later on in life, I really do not know, I think that I had a tremendous complex myself.</span> <span id="s1130">I thought that, you know, I was, I knew I was not as good as they were.</span> <span id="s1131">I knew I was that Cinderella.</span> <span id="s1132">I..</span> <span id="s1133">.</span> <span id="s1134">had a feeling that everybody is looking down on me.</span> <span id="s1135">I felt very uncomfortable with all the, I mean, really physical hard work which was so new to me except for being on Hachsharah when I was a kid, during the summer and this physical work.</span> <span id="s1136">I was emotionally more comfortable on the farm, because I just was, even though I was a maid, there was no class distinction.</span> <span id="s1137">I mean, I was one of them.</span> <span id="s1138">I ate with them and...</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">Q:You felt a part of the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">A:I felt part of the family.</span> <span id="s1141">But there, I certainly was not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">Q:There was a class distinction.</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">A:Yeah.</span> <span id="s1144">The girls, they came from all over.</span> <span id="s1145">They came from Sweden.</span> <span id="s1146">They came from Norway.</span> <span id="s1147">They were all, when they were out of their uniforms during the day, you know, I..</span> <span id="s1148">.</span> <span id="s1149">had the uniform, nothing.</span> <span id="s1150">But maybe I was wrong.</span> <span id="s1151">But that’s the way I felt.</span> <span id="s1152">Because when Christmas came they gave me a uniform because I only had one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">Q:But how could you have felt otherwise?</span> <span id="s1154">That situation...</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">A:And they gave me a uniform and they gave me textbooks for Christmas.</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">Q:Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">A:A textbook.</span> <span id="s1158">The girls got together, and they gave me a ring.</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">Q:A ring?</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">A:Yeah.</span> <span id="s1161">So they just...</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">Q:Just as a token of their love.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">A:Just as a token, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">Q:Did they have any idea of what your background had been in Prague?</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">A:No, they just knew that I was...</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">Q:Didn’t you ever...</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">A:A strange bird.</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">Q:Did you ever want to tell them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">A:No, no, no.</span> <span id="s1170">I didn’t, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">Q:I wonder why.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">A:I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1173">Maybe I just wanted to be so much a part of them...</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Q:You didn’t think that would interest them?</span> <span id="s1175">Or was it a world away?</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">A:I was still trying, I was trying so hard, so hard to be part of them that...</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">Q:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">A:I felt they didn’t want part of me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">Q:Mmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">A:I slept, I didn’t sleep in the dorm.</span> <span id="s1181">I slept in the maid’s quarters.</span> <span id="s1182">That was another thing.</span> <span id="s1183">So, and also like, you know, there was a boys’ military academy.</span> <span id="s1184">They got to dances together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">Q:You weren’t part of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">A:No.</span> <span id="s1187">I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1188">I didn’t.</span> <span id="s1189">I..</span> <span id="s1190">.</span> <span id="s1191">first of all, I was working.</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">Q:So you were shut out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">A:I was working.</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">Q:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">A:And secondly, I had no clothes.</span> <span id="s1196">And I had no money.</span> <span id="s1197">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">Q:Were you then...</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">A:I remember I was washing this uniform in the morning.</span> <span id="s1200">There were no dryers at that time.</span> <span id="s1201">And I am ironing it when it was wet, so I could wear it the next day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">Q:You were wearing...</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">A:And ironing it.</span> <span id="s1204">And then I had a, I still have it, I wrote everything by hand.</span> <span id="s1205">And I used to wr-, I don’t know why, but I always used to write in green ink.</span> <span id="s1206">I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s1207">But I had a window which was called Mansarde, that’s, under the roof where the window is slanted like that.</span> <span id="s1208">And I had a little, like a chest, like a toy chest, not a chest of drawers but an open chest.</span> <span id="s1209">And one day I came to their room and it snowed in and the snow washed all my textbooks out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">Q:Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">A:And I, I thought it was the worst tragedy.</span> <span id="s1212">In the meantime my parents are somewhere in concentration camp!</span> <span id="s1213">But...</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">Q:But, but...</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">A:And all my, everything was washed off.</span> <span id="s1216">And all the ink was running.</span> <span id="s1217">The snow was sitting and...</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">Q:Oh my dear.</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">A:Penetrating all through my books.</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">Q:Everything that you had handwritten.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">A:Handwritten, yeah, it was awful.</span> <span id="s1222">So that was sort of like before Christmas.</span> <span id="s1223">And for Christmas they gave me a textbook, one textbook.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">Q:That was a catastrophe!</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">A:Mmm hmm.</span> <span id="s1226">But it’s...you know, when you think of it now, it is so...</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">Q:Were you getting anything out of your studies?</span> <span id="s1228">Did they mean anything to you?</span> <span id="s1229">Or was it so unreal?</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">A:The studies were mostly [pause]...</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">Q:They were marginal.</span> <span id="s1232">They were marginal, weren’t they...</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">A:Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">Q:To any substantive work?</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">A:Well there was...</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">Q:Or did you have literature?</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">A:No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">Q:No literature.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">A:No, no.</span> <span id="s1240">It was a finishing, housekeeping school.</span> <span id="s1241">There was no Danish or there was no literature.</span> <span id="s1242">There was no math.</span> <span id="s1243">There was mostly...</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">Q:There was history?</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">A:Nutrition.</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">Q:Making of menus.</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">A:Make, yeah, making up menus, how to run your estates [chuckles].</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">Q:Were you hearing from your comrades during this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">A:No, um, no.</span> <span id="s1250">I, well, Christmas came, and everybody left the school to go home.</span> <span id="s1251">And here I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">Q:All alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">A:All alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">Q:Oh my.</span> <span id="s1255">Well how was the director?</span> <span id="s1256">Was she charitable?</span> <span id="s1257">Kindly?</span> <span id="s1258">Or self-centered?</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">A:She looked like Queen Victoria.</span> <span id="s1260">I’ll show you pictures later.</span> <span id="s1261">It’s, when I look at it today I think, unreal.</span> <span id="s1262">She wore a black dress, all the way down to the floor, with a..</span> <span id="s1263">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">Q:Brooch?</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">A:Cameo here, and a big bowler hat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">Q:Oh my dear.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">A:And she had a long mustache which were all here, and a white shawl.</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">Q:Grotesque.</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">A:And her daughter...</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">Q:What did...</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">A:Her daughter...</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">Q:Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">A:Was the, she was the head mistress and her daughter was whatever, the mistress.</span> <span id="s1274">There was a part in the middle, and the bun in the back.</span> <span id="s1275">Also had a dress but not black.</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">Q:How were the other teachers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">A:The only one who really took interest in me was a teacher who was teaching early child care, or child bear...</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">Q:Child care.</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">A:Child care.</span> <span id="s1280">She was a physician and she did not live on the estate.</span> <span id="s1281">She came in.</span> <span id="s1282">She was the one who really took some kind of interest in me.</span> <span id="s1283">Because I went in and baby-sit for her children once in a while.</span> <span id="s1284">And she said, “Well, you know, what do you want to do when you finish?</span> <span id="s1285">And what are you going to do?</span> <span id="s1286">And what are your plans?”</span> <span id="s1287">What am I going to do?</span> <span id="s1288">You know, for us the war is going to last a whole lifetime.</span> <span id="s1289">And it was, we never even think what’s going to happen.</span> <span id="s1290">“Going to Palestine.”</span> <span id="s1291">It still was Palestine at that time.</span> <span id="s1292">“But, and when you go, what are you going to do meantime when you finish school?”</span> <span id="s1293">And so I said, “Well my biggest ambition at this time is to become a maid in the city, not on the farm.</span> <span id="s1294">I want to get out of that farm business.”</span> <span id="s1295">And actually she was the one who was instrumental for me then to get a job after the school was finished, in a banking family, for a banker.</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">Q:So how long did you stay in this school then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">A:Six months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">Q:Six months.</span> <span id="s1299">This takes us into ‘42?</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">A:‘43.</span> <span id="s1301">It takes us into ‘43.</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">Q:‘43.</span> <span id="s1303">And you knew by then that your, pardon me, parents had gone to Theresienstadt?</span> <span id="s1304">And people also...</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">A:No, they did not go to Theresienstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">Q:No?</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">A:They went to Auschwitz right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">Q:From Prague?</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">A:Yeah.</span> <span id="s1310">I got a letter [pause] ‘42, ‘42, I got a letter from my brother at that time where he said, “You know, I thought I would be bar mitzvah but it doesn’t look that way.</span> <span id="s1311">And it was the only thing I wanted to live for was for my bar mitzvah.”</span> <span id="s1312">So that would be ‘42.</span> <span id="s1313">And then I got a letter also from my parents saying this is the last letter I’m getting.</span> <span id="s1314">O.K.</span> <span id="s1315">They had been selected.</span> <span id="s1316">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">Q:They said that in so many words?</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">A:Well, yeah, it’s the last letter.</span> <span id="s1319">And it was the last letter.</span> <span id="s1320">I had an uncle who escaped to Russia.</span> <span id="s1321">It was my mother’s brother.</span> <span id="s1322">And, you know, but nobody knew where he was.</span> <span id="s1323">And they felt that, you know, somehow if you ever can get in touch with him.</span> <span id="s1324">But of course then what was occupied by the Germans.</span> <span id="s1325">You couldn’t go to Russia, you know, right to Russia anywhere, you see.</span> <span id="s1326">Anyhow...</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">Q:So...</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">A:At that time I really tried to commit suicide seriously when I found out that, you know...</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">Q:You knew what Auschwitz meant, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">A:Yes and no.</span> <span id="s1331">I did not know what we know now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">Q:And I wonder...</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">A:There was no way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">Q:How much your parents knew.</span> <span id="s1335">Because in ‘42 it was still very early.</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">A:You knew it was...</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">Q:Something terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">A:Worse than bad.</span> <span id="s1339">But you did not know what it really was.</span> <span id="s1340">We did not know it.</span> <span id="s1341">Although, at that time also somehow when I was in the school, the underground, the Danish underground was brewing a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">Q:You were hearing some...</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">A:I was hearing a lot of, you know, vague, a lot of effects from the Danish underground.</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">Q:How did that come to the school, Hanna?</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">A:I do not know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">Q:Through the...</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">A:I do not know.</span> <span id="s1348">Maybe through the young people...</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">Q:Talk on the streets?</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">A:Through the talk.</span> <span id="s1351">The school was on an estate.</span> <span id="s1352">It was near Sorö.</span> <span id="s1353">That’s the name of the town, S-O-R-Ö.</span> <span id="s1354">And it was, there was a lot of talk about underground.</span> <span id="s1355">And they called themselves radishes, because the Danes are, their colors are white and red and the radish is underground.</span> <span id="s1356">And they’re white and red.</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">Q:I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">A:And so they were there radishes, they were called.</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">Q:Interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">A:Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">Q:And there was talk of sabotage...</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">A:Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">Q:In ‘42.</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">A:Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1365">There was a lot, maybe also through the faculty things started filtering down.</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">Q:Mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">A:And...</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">Q:Were you aware of an anti-German feeling by then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">A:Mmm hmm.</span> <span id="s1370">Mmm hmm.</span> <span id="s1371">Mmm hmm, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">Q:So, this physician that you’ve mentioned...</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">A:Yeah, Showek.</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">Q:She made arrangements for you to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">A:She made arrangements for me after we left the school, and found me in Naestved in a banking family a position as a maid.</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">Q:And Naestved is a fairly large town?</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">A:Naestved...</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">Q:Or a small town?</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">A:Oh, either [pause] I would say 100,000, 150,000.</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">Q:What sustained you during this terrible time, Hanna?</span> <span id="s1381">You said you...</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">A:You mean financially?</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">Q:No, no, spiritually.</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">A:I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1385">I really, I wish I could say some high-falutin philosophy...</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">Q:No, no, but...</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">A:Or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">Q:You were 18 or so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">A:No, I was 17, 16 at the...</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">Q:17, all alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">A:First of all, you knew that you are lucky.</span> <span id="s1392">We knew that.</span> <span id="s1393">I mean, you knew that.</span> <span id="s1394">You felt it.</span> <span id="s1395">You smelled it.</span> <span id="s1396">You could feel it that you’re lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">Q:You really did know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">A:Yeah, you knew that.</span> <span id="s1399">You knew that you were very lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">Q:Were you aware, then, of what was happening to Jews elsewhere in Europe, or just...</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">Q:Or you...</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">A:Not, as I said before, not as much, but you knew that if you stayed, you would not live in those conditions you are living in now, that you would not survive.</span> <span id="s1404">I mean, you knew that it was a thing you did not know about, the gas chambers, but I think you knew that you have it better...</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">Q:That it was terrible in your part of Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">A:Than they did.</span> <span id="s1407">You absolutely knew that.</span> <span id="s1408">You knew that.</span> <span id="s1409">You, I knew that I had plenty of food to eat, which I did.</span> <span id="s1410">I became real fat.</span> <span id="s1411">I knew I had a roof over my head.</span> <span id="s1412">I spoke Danish.</span> <span id="s1413">I, nobody was on my back.</span> <span id="s1414">The German were in Denmark already now for two years, but you really didn’t even feel them that much, at least I didn’t.</span> <span id="s1415">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">Q:Well, it was a model protectorate...</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">A:Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">Q:Up until ‘43.</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">A:Yeah.</span> <span id="s1420">So...</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">Q:And this...woman, this...</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">A:And I spoke Danish fluently and I wrote it and... One thing I never went through, like, you know, the kids go through, I never went through this finding myself business.</span> <span id="s1423">[chuckles] I never had this kind of a problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">Q:You didn’t have the luxury.</span> <span id="s1425">You need to have the luxury of...</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">A:Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">Q:Time and space for that.</span> <span id="s1428">Do you think this woman physician was a kind of support for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">A:Yeah, she...was the one who said, “What are you going to do?”</span> <span id="s1430">Yeah, and she posed me the question.</span> <span id="s1431">And I says, “Well, I’m going to stay here as a maid.”</span> <span id="s1432">Because that was the only thing I could think of, you know, continue to be, like for Christmas when all the girls went home I would, you know, do all the Christmas cleaning and all that and be there with...the owner, with the mistress.</span> <span id="s1433">And just think I never thought ahead.</span> <span id="s1434">I knew that eventually I’m going to go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1435">I knew that.</span> <span id="s1436">This is what was my raison d’être, to be there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">Q:So that must have been a very strong pulling force.</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">A:But, there started being crumbling things like there was some of the kids who started hearing about, who went over to Sweden already, and they were saying that, “Things are not going to stay that way under the German occupation and are going to get worse.</span> <span id="s1439">We are not going to stay pro-, you know, not persecuted.</span> <span id="s1440">Things are going to pop.</span> <span id="s1441">Now it’s almost two-and-a-half years after the occupation.</span> <span id="s1442">Nothing has been done against the Jews here, but it’s not going to stay that way.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">Q:I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1444">A:So some of them went to Sweden, but what Sweden did at that time was that they didn’t take them in.</span> <span id="s1445">They did not send them back to Denmark.</span> <span id="s1446">They sent them back to Czechoslovakia, Poland, Germany.</span> <span id="s1447">The Swedes did not send them back to the Danes, where they came from, and many of the young people who did take the courage, this is early ‘43 now I’m talking about...</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">Q:They deported them back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">A:They deported them from that place where they came from.</span> <span id="s1450">So many of them did perish in concentration camps later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1451">Q:This was ‘43?</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">A:That’s the beginning ‘43.</span> <span id="s1453">Don’t forget that Sweden in that time had a pact with Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">Q:Well Sweden was neutral I thought.</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">A:Sweden...was neutral, but...</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">Q:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">A:But Sweden was supplying all...</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">Q:Iron ore.</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">A:Iron ore to Germany.</span> <span id="s1460">They did have a sort of a government in exile, under the British auspices or something, in order to maintain their picture of neutrality.</span> <span id="s1461">But they did, commercially and politically, they were pro-Germanic, very much so, the Swedes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">Q:And...</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">A:In order to be sort of considered as a neutral country they had, you know, like, there was a Czech Embassy in exile there who had, which had no power, no diplomatic power or something like that.</span> <span id="s1464">But they were trying to help the immigrants or something, you know, like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">Q:And...</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">A:But the Swedes did, in the beginning, send them back to Poland, wherever people came from.</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">Q:And there were large numbers of such Jews who...</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">A:No.</span> <span id="s1469">There, we...all were, heard about incident here and incident there, and things starting to come filtering down to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">Q:So you went to work, then, with this banking family?</span> <span id="s1471">Was this...</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">A:I went to work with the banking family, in Naestved.</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">Q:Early, early ‘43?</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">A:No, June ‘43.</span></p> <p><span id="s1475">Q:June.</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">A:Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">Q:And how was that situation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">A:That was terrible.</span> <span id="s1479">But I was also near this girl who was at this music teacher because she stayed there, who was adopted, who lives in Canada now, whom I stayed...</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">Q:Very close to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">A:Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">Q:So you could see her at least.</span> <span id="s1483">And this family was...</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">A:This family was a banking family.</span> <span id="s1485">The bank was on the first floor.</span> <span id="s1486">Their headquarters was on the second floor, and my quarters were like on the third floor.</span> <span id="s1487">So it’s a little town like that.</span> <span id="s1488">And everything was fine, until one day I used their bathroom, instead of going up to, upstairs.</span> <span id="s1489">And the woman just absolutely flipped her lid, that I used her toilet on the second floor...</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">Q:Oh my dear.</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">A:Instead of third floor.</span> <span id="s1492">But I didn’t, I wasn’t there long.</span> <span id="s1493">I was there six weeks, when the thing against the Jewish people started.</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">Q:October, in ‘43.</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">A:October, yeah, it was ‘43.</span> <span id="s1496">And when I worked, like in September...was starting rumors, “You go underground.”</span> <span id="s1497">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">Q:You heard this from the Danish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">A:From the Danish people.</span> <span id="s1500">It was...a [pause] I really do not know.</span> <span id="s1501">Many of, particularly the boys—you know at that time they are 18, 19—they knew.</span> <span id="s1502">And they were supposed to, we had a chain if something happened.</span> <span id="s1503">You know, your contacts...</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">Q:Your comrades in the Zionist movement.</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">A:Yes, yeah.</span> <span id="s1506">The person who was supposed to contact me left, to save his own skin.</span> <span id="s1507">He is in Israel now too, without contacting me.</span> <span id="s1508">And nobody contacted me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">Q:Where did he go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">A:He went to the coast to go to Sweden.</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">Q:Oh, to flee.</span> <span id="s1512">And he never gave you the message?</span> <span id="s1513">[pause] And did your banking family know?</span> <span id="s1514">Did they warn you?</span> <span id="s1515">They didn’t try to protect you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">A:No, one day a Dane came and picked me up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">Q:A Danish policeman?</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">A:No, a Danish young man from the underground, from that other...</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">Q:I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">A:He picked me up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">Q:He...</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">A:Took me to the coast.</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">Q:He took, he knew you were Jewish.</span> <span id="s1524">How do you suppose he knew?</span> <span id="s1525">Did you ever find out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">A:Yeah.</span> <span id="s1527">We were all registered with police.</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">Q:I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">A:But you see, in Copenhagen where the...</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">Q:Bulk of the population was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">A:Jewish population is, their list came from the Jewish community or from the synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">Q:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1533">A:But they already had left a long, long time, I mean not a long time ago.</span> <span id="s1534">That time two weeks is a long time.</span> <span id="s1535">You know, one day is a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">Q:Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">A:And so before this sort of fizzled down, and that, I must say the Danes really made sure of, there was a transport 350 Jews going to concentra-, to Theresienstadt, from Denmark.</span> <span id="s1538">That was it.</span> <span id="s1539">That was it.</span> <span id="s1540">That was the only one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">Q:The only one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">A:The only one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">Q:Were any of your friends in that...</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">A:So we were, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">Q:No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">A:These were mostly people from Copenhagen.</span> <span id="s1547">And we were not allowed in cities.</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">Q:I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">A:Yeah, by the police.</span> <span id="s1550">And we were not allowed to the cities.</span> <span id="s1551">And when we got to Sweden we were not allowed in the cities either.</span> <span id="s1552">Sweden was much stricter at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">Q:And so your other friends were similarly picked up by Danes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1554">A:By Danes, yes.</span> <span id="s1555">And taken to the coast.</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">Q:By bicycle?</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">A:Mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">Q:What did this young man...</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">A:But the curfew, there was curfew, right?</span> <span id="s1560">So we was...</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">Q:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">A:Going through the curfew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">Q:What did this young man say to you, Hanna?</span> <span id="s1564">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">A:Oh, he said to me, “Go in hiding,” you know?</span> <span id="s1566">But at that time you’re already, you know, things were brewing and you knew, you develop a seventh sense or sixth sense for these things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">Q:And so you went to the coast with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">A:We went to the coast, on a bike.</span> <span id="s1569">We went to a church and stayed in that church for one week.</span></p> <p><span id="s1570">Q:Just housed there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">A:Housed in the church, and we slept under the pews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">Q:You were told...</span></p> <p><span id="s1573">A:I was the...</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">Q:Did they give you some food?</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">A:Yeah, they brought some food in.</span> <span id="s1576">O.K., now this is a completely different story in my life.</span> <span id="s1577">I, where I was in the church, I was the only female and only Jewish.</span> <span id="s1578">Most of them were Danish officers who were there at the time.</span> <span id="s1579">But I was particularly involved...</span></p> <p><span id="s1580">Q:They were also in hiding or underground?</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">A:They were underground, but they wanted to flee to Denmark.</span> <span id="s1582">O.K., they were from there...</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">Q:To Sweden.</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">A:To, excuse me, yes, to Sweden, and flee Denmark.</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">Q:I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">A:And there were people who were in the Danish Army that probably had, I really do not know, because nobody talked...</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">Q:A sort of...</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">A:Anti-Nazi...</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">Q:Resistance army.</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">A:Yeah.</span> <span id="s1591">But there were no Jewish families, except there was one mother who was like 80, with her daughter, who was like 60.</span> <span id="s1592">And they were pretty much feeble.</span> <span id="s1593">And when I..</span> <span id="s1594">.</span> <span id="s1595">And every night we took outings to that, to the beach and to see whether, you know, a boat came.</span> <span id="s1596">Now the thing is this, the Danish fishermen, they took you over.</span> <span id="s1597">But you had to pay.</span> <span id="s1598">Well, I had nothing.</span> <span id="s1599">So, you know, nobody does anything for altruistic motives.</span> <span id="s1600">And so the ones who could pay more, they got in first.</span> <span id="s1601">The ones who didn’t pay anything, they had to sneak themselves, almost, on the boat.</span> <span id="s1602">But the heads were counted.</span> <span id="s1603">And I often wondered later in life whether even the banking family knew when I left or why I left.</span> <span id="s1604">Because...</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">Q:I wondered about that myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s1607">I often wondered, yes, because I just left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">Q:They knew you...were Jewish, of course?</span></p> <p><span id="s1609">A:You know, I think so, yeah.</span> <span id="s1610">I think, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">Q:You’re not even sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">A:Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1613">They knew I was a poor immigrant.</span> <span id="s1614">[chuckles] Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">Q:So you stayed in this church for a week.</span> <span id="s1616">You were the only young woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">A:Yeah.</span> <span id="s1618">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">Q:And...</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">A:Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">Q:Were you treated respectfully?</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">A:Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1623">I mean there were, you know, this church was sort of like a center where people came, people left, people came, people left.</span> <span id="s1624">And you...</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">Q:And eventually.</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">A:Were processing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">Q:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">A:So, I got on a boat.</span> <span id="s1629">And it was a fishing boat, a herring boat, a little, tiny boat.</span> <span id="s1630">And there were 25 of us.</span> <span id="s1631">And it was, so what do you call these little fishing boats?</span> <span id="s1632">There is a name for it.</span> <span id="s1633">Anyhow, and you see, people came from different hiding places.</span> <span id="s1634">And who is on my boat is the chief rabbi, Rabbi Melchior.</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">Q:Melchior?</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">A:Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1637">Q:Of Copenhagen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1638">A:Of Copenhagen, whose grandson my daughter eventually met in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">Q:My word.</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">A:O.</span> <span id="s1641">K.</span></p> <p><span id="s1642">Q:Was he with his family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">A:With his whole family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">Q:What sort of...</span></p> <p><span id="s1645">A:Five children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">Q:What sort of man was he?</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">A:O.</span> <span id="s1648">K., could we shut off the machine?</span> <span id="s1649">This I don’t [tape off then on] O.K., I found out that he- Tape 2 of 3, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">Q:This is tape two, side two, continuing our interview with Mrs. Hanna Seckel.</span> <span id="s1651">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">A:I did not know.</span> <span id="s1653">I..</span> <span id="s1654">.</span> <span id="s1655">never was in Copenhagen, except on the train station, when I arrived in ‘39.</span> <span id="s1656">And I, at that time when I arrived, this is, the site that I see, the first thing I see telephone, telegraph.</span> <span id="s1657">And I says, “Oh my gosh, that looks like Czech, you know, I won’t have such a hard time of speaking the Danish language.”</span> <span id="s1658">But that was the only time that I was in Copenhagen.</span> <span id="s1659">Never was, we were not allowed to go to the cities.</span> <span id="s1660">And every time you moved like from one place to the other you had to have a permit from the police to do that and they took a long time.</span> <span id="s1661">And so, I really had nothing to do with the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s1662">We were a nucleus of people.</span> <span id="s1663">We got together sometimes on Hanukkah and on Pesach.</span> <span id="s1664">We got together on each other’s birthday.</span> <span id="s1665">But that was all out in the country.</span> <span id="s1666">We really did not know what was happening in the city.</span> <span id="s1667">So I did not know who he was, even.</span> <span id="s1668">You knew right away, but I did not know his name was Melchior.</span> <span id="s1669">I did not know.</span> <span id="s1670">I found that out on the boat.</span> <span id="s1671">And he was there with his wife and five children.</span> <span id="s1672">And of course he wanted certain privileges, being the Chief Rabbi.</span> <span id="s1673">And there was also this lady, this, with her mother, with her 80-year-old mother.</span> <span id="s1674">And there were a couple of Danish officers on the boat.</span> <span id="s1675">And then some other young Danish people who were in the underground.</span> <span id="s1676">Nobody ever revealed...</span></p> <p><span id="s1677">Q:To...</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">A:But the Rabbi, his family, myself and those two ladies were the only Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1679">The other ones were the Danes, who were fleeing, so it was not a boat full of Jews.</span> <span id="s1680">There were 25 of us.</span> <span id="s1681">And we go in the hull of the ship and they cover us up with straw and all of us and so on.</span> <span id="s1682">And we are sailing and sailing and sailing and sailing and sailing and sailing.</span> <span id="s1683">Well, between Helsingör and Hälsingborg, which is the Kattegat, the distance is really nothing.</span> <span id="s1684">And we’re on the boat for ten hours and we are getting no where.</span></p> <p><span id="s1685">Q:Right.</span> <span id="s1686">And you’re under these...</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">A:Yeah, so, you know, when we are up on the open sea, this is October now, it’s right after.</span> <span id="s1688">We see the German always did the raids on yomtov, right, on the Jewish holiday.</span> <span id="s1689">So that was right after Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s1690">And suddenly, O.K., I think it was the Rabbi, who did find out that this fisherman, who really was not a f-, either he was not a fisherman but he didn’t have a map.</span> <span id="s1691">He didn’t have a compass.</span> <span id="s1692">He didn’t nothing.</span> <span id="s1693">He just sailed according to the stars.</span> <span id="s1694">And what happened that we wound up in Gödser, which is the Polish side, right, on the Kattegat.</span> <span id="s1695">And the German came on board of the ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s1696">Q:Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s1697">A:The German soldiers with their bayonets.</span> <span id="s1698">And we were under this.</span> <span id="s1699">They were walking on top of that boat.</span> <span id="s1700">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s1701">Q:Mmm!</span></p> <p><span id="s1702">A:You know...</span></p> <p><span id="s1703">Q:Oh!</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">A:Your heart was in your throat, to say the least.</span> <span id="s1705">And we were all there.</span> <span id="s1706">And later on, I think to this day, I think that the German must have known that we were there.</span> <span id="s1707">It’s impossible they did not know, when they examined this little shanty, that they would not know that we were not there.</span> <span id="s1708">O.K.?</span></p> <p><span id="s1709">Q:And never once uncovered the tarpaulin?</span></p> <p><span id="s1710">A:No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1711">Q:No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">A:Well, they never, there were some herring on top of that tarpaulin and we were under the herrings.</span></p> <p><span id="s1713">Q:Just one man, one German?</span></p> <p><span id="s1714">A:No.</span> <span id="s1715">I think there were, they all, they never came one, never, never, never.</span> <span id="s1716">They always came in pairs.</span> <span id="s1717">And he ordered the fisherman to go back...</span></p> <p><span id="s1718">Q:To Denmark.</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">A:To Denmark, which we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">Q:Another ten-hour trip.</span> <span id="s1721">And what [unclear]...</span></p> <p><span id="s1722">A:We turned around on the same boat and went the other direction.</span> <span id="s1723">Well, at that time, everybody was getting sea sick, absolutely, you know.</span> <span id="s1724">Everybody was sick.</span> <span id="s1725">I didn’t because I hadn’t eaten for four days, so I had nothing to throw up.</span> <span id="s1726">But...</span></p> <p><span id="s1727">Q:Oh, you must have been...</span></p> <p><span id="s1728">A:Now the Rabbi started such a stink.</span> <span id="s1729">Oh gosh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1730">Q:Because the man had lost his direction?</span></p> <p><span id="s1731">A:He was now saying he’s a, you know, he was bribing him.</span> <span id="s1732">He says, you know, “If you’ve got a value, I’ll give you,” I don’t know, well he was just absolutely bribing him, saying, “I’m a Chief Rabbi and you have to take us to Denmark [Sweden] and I have a suitcase full of silver.”</span> <span id="s1733">I remember this so vividly.</span> <span id="s1734">And, “You have to,” and so on, so on.</span> <span id="s1735">And the fisherman says to him, “Look, my life is at stake just as much”—he had a young man there with him— “as yours.</span> <span id="s1736">I mean, I am going to be decapitated as much.</span> <span id="s1737">Well I have a interest to get you over too, not for you, but for me.”</span> <span id="s1738">And we got to Sweden eventually.</span> <span id="s1739">What I want to say, maybe off the record, is that many, many years later when my children attended Hebrew School, they used to get a newspaper which was called New Horizon or something, from the Union Hebrew organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s1740">Q:Of Congregations.</span></p> <p><span id="s1741">A:Congregations.</span></p> <p><span id="s1742">Q:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1743">A:And there is an article about the brave Jews.</span> <span id="s1744">And one of them is about Rabbi Melchior, that he knocked over, or knocked out the fisherman, and he took the boat himself, with all of us, to safety.</span></p> <p><span id="s1745">Q:Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s1746">A:And when I saw that...</span></p> <p><span id="s1747">Q:Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">A:When my children, I read that, I wrote to the publisher, and I wrote them my maiden name.</span> <span id="s1749">And I said, “This is not so.</span> <span id="s1750">I know the date.</span> <span id="s1751">I know the day.”</span> <span id="s1752">And I says, “I have nothing against the Rabbi.</span> <span id="s1753">At this point he must be an elderly man.”</span> <span id="s1754">Still, the other son still was alive, and then his son became a Rabbi, and his grandson also.</span></p> <p><span id="s1755">Q:Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s1756">A:But it was not true.</span> <span id="s1757">It is not true.</span></p> <p><span id="s1758">Q:He was far from a hero.</span></p> <p><span id="s1759">A:And I still have the...</span></p> <p><span id="s1760">Q:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1761">A:I still have the book, where it says, A Rabbi Remembers, it’s called.</span> <span id="s1762">It is not true.</span> <span id="s1763">That is not what that man did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1764">Q:He wasn’t behaving very nicely at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">A:Not at all.</span> <span id="s1766">Not at all.</span> <span id="s1767">I remember even that his son who, now, of course, he was a real redhead and he was always throwing up and green in his face.</span> <span id="s1768">And I..</span> <span id="s1769">.</span> <span id="s1770">wasn’t sick.</span> <span id="s1771">So I used to carry all these buckets and throw in into the sea.</span> <span id="s1772">But that really bothered me quite many years later.</span> <span id="s1773">I don’t know why, but it did bother me, that did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1774">Q:Well, you expect some moral leadership at a time like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1775">A:That he was, you know, that then, 25 years later, he makes himself such a hero that he took us to safety, which was not true at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1776">Q:It became a myth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1777">A:Yeah.</span> <span id="s1778">But I was...</span></p> <p><span id="s1779">Q:Well how do you account for the fact that the fisherman lost his direction?</span> <span id="s1780">Was he just inexperienced?</span></p> <p><span id="s1781">A:Well, then many, much later we found out that he was really, you know, he was a criminal.</span> <span id="s1782">And his, all his criminal in the Danish, not in the war sense, O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s1783">Q:But...</span></p> <p><span id="s1784">A:I mean, not subversive element to the...</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">Q:But had...</span></p> <p><span id="s1786">A:Occupation, but he was a criminal, and his license was revoked.</span> <span id="s1787">His compass was revoked, and his [unclear].</span> <span id="s1788">Everything was, and he was trying to make money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1789">Q:I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1790">A:Then somebody else told me later on that he really was not a fisherman at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1791">Q:I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1792">A:But we got into the Danish [Swedish] waters.</span> <span id="s1793">And that was 22 hours later after we left...</span></p> <p><span id="s1794">Q:22 hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s1795">A:That I know.</span> <span id="s1796">And you know, it’s like crossing the...</span></p> <p><span id="s1797">Q:It’s two-and-a-half miles or so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1798">A:Delaware!</span> <span id="s1799">Yeah, like crossing the Delaware.</span></p> <p><span id="s1800">Q:Isn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1801">A:And I think that was really something.</span> <span id="s1802">Because suddenly you see the coast.</span> <span id="s1803">Yeah, first we didn’t even know whether it was the Danish coast or the Swedish coast or the Polish coast.</span> <span id="s1804">And suddenly we see all these little rowboats coming, rowing out to us and waving and God, I mean, it really was something, you know?</span> <span id="s1805">And many years later when I sort of see about these Vietnamese, the boat people, how they came over and Israel took some of the boat people, I know exactly...</span></p> <p><span id="s1806">Q:Exactly...</span></p> <p><span id="s1807">A:Exactly how they felt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1808">Q:How it felt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1809">A:I know.</span> <span id="s1810">And the Swedes came over in rowboats and they took us on the rowboats.</span> <span id="s1811">Now, we didn’t even know where we landed, I mean, what town or what not.</span> <span id="s1812">And we all just, we just all cried.</span> <span id="s1813">We all just abso-, it was like seeing the Promised Land, you know?</span> <span id="s1814">We all did cry a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1815">Q:How did you...</span></p> <p><span id="s1816">A:And now we come to the Danish coast [Swedish], and, yeah, go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1817">Q:Excuse me.</span> <span id="s1818">What happened to change Swedish opinion about immigrants?</span></p> <p><span id="s1819">A:I think it was...</span></p> <p><span id="s1820">Q:[coughing] Excuse me, it was...</span></p> <p><span id="s1821">A:Stalingrad.</span></p> <p><span id="s1822">Q:Stalingrad.</span> <span id="s1823">I have read that.</span> <span id="s1824">And a more pro-Allied feeling developing within Sweden.</span> <span id="s1825">Did you also hear that there had been an arrangement made between Neils Bohr, the famous Dutch scientist, and the Swedish king to create a haven for Danish Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s1826">A:Neils Bohr?</span></p> <p><span id="s1827">Q:Neils Bohr.</span> <span id="s1828">Did you ever hear that story?</span> <span id="s1829">That has appeared also in some of the texts.</span></p> <p><span id="s1830">A:Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1831">Q:But there was a real welcome for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1832">A:Well you see, the Danes themselves were very protective towards the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1833">Q:But it required a refuge in Sweden...</span></p> <p><span id="s1834">A:Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1835">Q:To make this possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1836">A:Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1837">Q:So Sweden had to be willing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1838">A:Well you know the famous story about that Danish king didn’t allow the Danes to wear the Jewish star, right?</span> <span id="s1839">And that he was the first one who rode on his horse, and which is an absolutely true story.</span> <span id="s1840">And we never wore a star.</span></p> <p><span id="s1841">Q:But the fact that Sweden allowed itself and became willing to be the refuge, that’s an interesting patch of history.</span> <span id="s1842">In any case...</span></p> <p><span id="s1843">A:At that time there was already a lot of, like government, right, we, when I got there late, and this is ‘43 now, there was a Czech government in exile there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1844">Q:In Sweden?</span></p> <p><span id="s1845">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1846">Q:Interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1847">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1848">Q:So where were you taken then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1849">A:Like I said, we did not know where we landed, O.K.?</span> <span id="s1850">One more little story which...</span></p> <p><span id="s1851">Q:Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1852">A:I always really like.</span> <span id="s1853">It’s sort of a little anecdote.</span> <span id="s1854">We come to the coast, and the fishermen, or the people in the rowboats kind of pick us up.</span> <span id="s1855">And at that time we landed on the land, set foot on the land.</span> <span id="s1856">It’s a fishing village.</span> <span id="s1857">And here’s the boat full of 25, 30 people.</span> <span id="s1858">And now that, have never seen, in this town, never seen anything in this fishing village like that.</span> <span id="s1859">And they’re all starting to fight among each other.</span> <span id="s1860">Now Danish and Swedish is very similar, the language.</span> <span id="s1861">It’s, you can understand particularly when they get mad, you can understand what they’re talking about.</span> <span id="s1862">And they were, these fishing wives, they were fighting who is going to go whose house to eat?</span> <span id="s1863">Because they set out big spreads for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1864">Q:They were really quarreling over...</span></p> <p><span id="s1865">A:Who, yeah...</span></p> <p><span id="s1866">Q:Who would have the honor?</span></p> <p><span id="s1867">A:How, well, who is going to have how many for lunch, or for dinner, or for that, who.</span></p> <p><span id="s1868">Q:Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1869">A:O.</span> <span id="s1870">K.?</span> <span id="s1871">We haven’t eaten.</span></p> <p><span id="s1872">Q:Interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1873">A:And now, I did not know most of the people on the boat, because everybody, you know, just stuck to himself except I met all of them but didn’t ask their name in that I was emptying all these buckets of that vomit all the time.</span> <span id="s1874">And so, and everybody was pulling people, “Come to my house.</span> <span id="s1875">Come to my house.</span> <span id="s1876">Come to my house to eat.”</span> <span id="s1877">And I then decided I better stick with the rabbi, even though I didn’t like him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1878">Q:[chuckles]</span></p> <p><span id="s1879">A:But go with the Jewish family, anyhow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1880">Q:[laughing, coughing] Excuse me!</span></p> <p><span id="s1881">A:So I go to this house, and here is set up a typically, typically Swedish...smorgasbord, O.K.?</span> <span id="s1882">And the table is full with salamis and cheeses and herrings and bread, dark bread, rye bread, and oh, oh my God.</span></p> <p><span id="s1883">Q:Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s1884">A:And I haven’t eaten for four days.</span></p> <p><span id="s1885">Q:Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s1886">A:And just looking at it, and...the rabbi looks at it and he says, “That’s not kosher.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1887">Q:Oh my dear.</span></p> <p><span id="s1888">A:“All I want is a hard-boiled egg.”</span> <span id="s1889">But I..</span> <span id="s1890">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1891">Q:Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s1892">A:I don’t know, it just hit me so badly, because and now I did not know what shall I do?</span> <span id="s1893">Shall I eat or shall I have a hard-boiled egg?</span> <span id="s1894">[chuckling] And you know, I’m saying this anecdote for one reason, because you went through so much, and this suddenly became a big problem!</span></p> <p><span id="s1895">Q:It was a problem.</span> <span id="s1896">You were in a dilemma.</span> <span id="s1897">Were the Swedish people horrified by the Rabbi’s lack of hospitality?</span></p> <p><span id="s1898">A:I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1899">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1900">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1901">Q:They produced the hard-boiled egg.</span> <span id="s1902">And what did you decide?</span> <span id="s1903">I don’t...</span></p> <p><span id="s1904">A:I ate a hard-boiled egg too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1905">Q:You didn’t partake of...</span></p> <p><span id="s1906">A:Yeah, I..</span> <span id="s1907">.</span> <span id="s1908">and I ate the herring.</span></p> <p><span id="s1909">Q:All of the...</span></p> <p><span id="s1910">A:Because they had all these kinds of herring.</span> <span id="s1911">I ate the hard-boiled egg.</span> <span id="s1912">So then...</span></p> <p><span id="s1913">Q:My.</span> <span id="s1914">Were there other refugees with...</span></p> <p><span id="s1915">A:We, I was the only one in this house with the rabbi’s family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1916">Q:I see.</span> <span id="s1917">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s1918">A:And in the evening, or next day, in the evening—in the evening, because we didn’t stay there overnight—the police came.</span> <span id="s1919">We called the police and the police came, took our data.</span> <span id="s1920">They took our fingerprints.</span> <span id="s1921">They took our pictures.</span> <span id="s1922">And they took us to a high school.</span> <span id="s1923">No, yeah, they took us to a high school.</span> <span id="s1924">And there was more paper formalities and so on.</span> <span id="s1925">And they assigned us to go to different places.</span> <span id="s1926">Now in the meantime I was just thinking, “Where are all the chaverim?</span> <span id="s1927">Where did they go?”</span></p> <p><span id="s1928">Q:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1929">A:“When did they go?</span> <span id="s1930">Where, now, how come I’m the only one?”</span></p> <p><span id="s1931">Q:Where...</span></p> <p><span id="s1932">A:“Or did they all go?”</span> <span id="s1933">I did not know.</span> <span id="s1934">“How am I going to get in touch with them,” and all that stuff.</span> <span id="s1935">Now, an interesting anecdote was this, that they brought us clothes, because nothing.</span> <span id="s1936">So, I got my first pair of black panties, my first pair of a black bra, a black dress, and black stockings.</span></p> <p><span id="s1937">Q:All black?</span></p> <p><span id="s1938">A:All black.</span> <span id="s1939">Somebody must have been mourning.</span> <span id="s1940">And, but I never in my life had black panties.</span> <span id="s1941">And they were really sexy.</span> <span id="s1942">But, at the same time, we got, which I, I was 18, but I was as innocent as a baby.</span> <span id="s1943">No idea today, just it’s like last century.</span> <span id="s1944">Maybe it was.</span> <span id="s1945">They gave us birth control pills.</span></p> <p><span id="s1946">Q:My word!</span></p> <p><span id="s1947">A:And they gave us a little soap, or it was like for the vagina, a little foam.</span></p> <p><span id="s1948">Q:Douche?</span></p> <p><span id="s1949">A:I became so insulted.</span> <span id="s1950">You have no idea.</span> <span id="s1951">I said, “What do they think I am?</span> <span id="s1952">Do they think that I am a street girl?”</span></p> <p><span id="s1953">Q:This was given to you by...</span></p> <p><span id="s1954">A:By the Red Cross.</span></p> <p><span id="s1955">Q:In the high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1956">A:Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1957">Q:By the Swedish Red Cross?</span> <span id="s1958">How very Swedish.</span> <span id="s1959">But how...extremely...</span></p> <p><span id="s1960">A:I was, I thought, “Who do they think I am?”</span> <span id="s1961">You know, what am I?</span> <span id="s1962">Look, oh...</span></p> <p><span id="s1963">Q:Oh my.</span> <span id="s1964">What did the Red Cross worker say?</span></p> <p><span id="s1965">A:Nothing.</span> <span id="s1966">They just, you know, they had packages and they gave it to...</span></p> <p><span id="s1967">Q:Routine, like giving you Band-Aids.</span></p> <p><span id="s1968">A:Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1969">And...that’s also one of my memories which sort of was a new experience!</span> <span id="s1970">[chuckles]</span></p> <p><span id="s1971">Q:Oh [unclear].</span> <span id="s1972">How many people were there in the high school, do you suppose?</span></p> <p><span id="s1973">A:A lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1974">Q:Hundreds or more?</span></p> <p><span id="s1975">A:Yeah, a lot of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1976">Q:Hundreds.</span></p> <p><span id="s1977">A:Now...</span></p> <p><span id="s1978">Q:But still, you didn’t see any of your comrades.</span></p> <p><span id="s1979">A:No.</span> <span id="s1980">No, no.</span> <span id="s1981">“Where are you going?</span> <span id="s1982">Do you have relatives?</span> <span id="s1983">Who is going to take you?”</span> <span id="s1984">You know, “Nobody is going to take me.”</span> <span id="s1985">“So what are you going to do?”</span> <span id="s1986">You know, “Stay here for one week or so.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1987">Q:They had even baths there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1988">A:But it was not really a..</span> <span id="s1989">.</span> <span id="s1990">high school.</span> <span id="s1991">It was also a agricultural boarding school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1992">Q:I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1993">A:But they were like on a potato break, what they call potato vacation break, where the kids go home and pick the potatoes and then they come back to school.</span> <span id="s1994">And the school had to start pretty soon.</span> <span id="s1995">So they had to empty the gym where we were sleeping, eating.</span> <span id="s1996">And so now what am, oh, what am I going to do?</span> <span id="s1997">No idea where the other people were, absolutely no idea.</span> <span id="s1998">No way to get in touch with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1999">Q:Did any...</span></p> <p><span id="s2000">A:And that class did not do very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s2001">Q:Were there any representatives of Jewish organizations at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s2002">A:No, no, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2003">Q:Nothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s2004">A:Nothing.</span> <span id="s2005">Nothing.</span> <span id="s2006">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2007">Q:Because I had read that the Jewish community actually provided...</span></p> <p><span id="s2008">A:Maybe they did, but not for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2009">Q:A good deal of funds for this reception.</span></p> <p><span id="s2010">A:Probably yes, but not for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2011">Q:But you didn’t see any.</span></p> <p><span id="s2012">A:No.</span> <span id="s2013">And the rabbi disappears with his wife, because he has of course contacts.</span></p> <p><span id="s2014">Q:Contacts.</span></p> <p><span id="s2015">A:He doesn’t say a word to me, “Do you want to come along?</span> <span id="s2016">Where do you have to go?</span> <span id="s2017">Where do you have to...?”</span> <span id="s2018">Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2019">Q:Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2020">A:Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2021">Q:Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2022">A:O.</span> <span id="s2023">K.</span></p> <p><span id="s2024">Q:That’s...</span></p> <p><span id="s2025">A:So what I decided is to become a maid in the school, O.K.?</span> <span id="s2026">When the students arrive, it’s boys.</span></p> <p><span id="s2027">Q:There wasn’t a family that came to ask if you would be willing...</span></p> <p><span id="s2028">A:No, at that time I was 18 also.</span></p> <p><span id="s2029">Q:I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2030">A:I was no more a child.</span> <span id="s2031">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s2032">Q:So again you relied on your own resources.</span></p> <p><span id="s2033">A:So I decided to become a maid in the school.</span> <span id="s2034">So they...I asked, you know, when the school starts and so on.</span> <span id="s2035">And they understood.</span> <span id="s2036">You see, this southern part of Sweden, they use a lot of Danish words.</span> <span id="s2037">Further on when you come up to Stockholm in the northern part of Sweden, then it becomes really Swedish.</span> <span id="s2038">But they have a lot of, you know, don’t forget those kings were also brothers, right?</span> <span id="s2039">The Danish [unclear].</span> <span id="s2040">So, it’s sort of a cousin language.</span> <span id="s2041">So that’s what I did.</span> <span id="s2042">But...</span></p> <p><span id="s2043">Q:You introduced yourself to the officials of the school?</span></p> <p><span id="s2044">A:Yeah.</span> <span id="s2045">I said, you know, to, whether I could stay there and work in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s2046">So they told me the only job they would have is in the kitchen, to clean fish, because they like, in Sweden you eat herring every lunch, breakfast, and dinner.</span> <span id="s2047">And that’s what I did for six months.</span> <span id="s2048">I was over there.</span> <span id="s2049">Later I was sitting in the kitchen with a..</span> <span id="s2050">.</span></p> <p><span id="s2051">Q:Fish knife?</span></p> <p><span id="s2052">A:Fish knife, and a apron, which was made of burlap.</span> <span id="s2053">And I was cleaning fish and once in a while I was cooking in these big, big pots the oatmeal for breakfast, and washing the pots.</span> <span id="s2054">The pots were so big you could stand in them and wash them.</span> <span id="s2055">And that’s what I did, for six months.</span></p> <p><span id="s2056">Q:And Hannah, all of the other people were farmed out to homes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2057">A:All of the other people were farmed out...</span></p> <p><span id="s2058">Q:And you were the only person...</span></p> <p><span id="s2059">A:I was the only one who stayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2060">Q:Who had no place to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s2061">A:In the meantime I was trying to get in touch somehow with the chaverim.</span></p> <p><span id="s2062">Q:With your friends.</span> <span id="s2063">Yes, what had happened to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2064">A:What had happened?</span> <span id="s2065">I could not get in touch with anybody.</span> <span id="s2066">I, today I think that I didn’t go about it the right way.</span> <span id="s2067">I did not know which way to go about it.</span> <span id="s2068">However...</span></p> <p><span id="s2069">Q:They did come to Sweden, didn’t they?</span></p> <p><span id="s2070">A:They did come to Sweden, yeah.</span> <span id="s2071">They did come to Sweden.</span> <span id="s2072">Some of them immediately, the boys, immediately when they came to Sweden, by Sweden being neutral, they enlisted in the Czech Army out of England.</span> <span id="s2073">And they went to England.</span></p> <p><span id="s2074">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2075">A:And they got into that Czech Army...</span></p> <p><span id="s2076">Q:In exile.</span></p> <p><span id="s2077">A:In exile.</span></p> <p><span id="s2078">Q:And the girls?</span></p> <p><span id="s2079">A:The girls stayed on.</span> <span id="s2080">But by that time there were a lot of romances going on also.</span></p> <p><span id="s2081">Q:I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2082">A:Very, you know, we were a, like a, you know, why I am so friendly with all these people, we were the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s2083">Q:Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s2084">A:We were very, we thought we were supportive of each other and we probably were.</span></p> <p><span id="s2085">Q:And you were.</span> <span id="s2086">But how terrible that you couldn’t make contact.</span></p> <p><span id="s2087">A:So, I couldn’t get contact.</span> <span id="s2088">And then it went on, and then afterwards I started, you know...</span></p> <p><span id="s2089">Q:Excuse me, were you far from Stockholm?</span></p> <p><span id="s2090">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s2091">I was right on the southern tip.</span> <span id="s2092">I was near Lund.</span></p> <p><span id="s2093">Q:I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2094">A:Lund.</span> <span id="s2095">O.K.?</span> <span id="s2096">Between Malmö and Lund I was, O.K.?</span> <span id="s2097">And Lund...is the oldest university really in Scandinavia there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2098">Q:So...you...</span></p> <p><span id="s2099">A:So I was running, you know, going to the uni-, O.K., and also it was the first time, when I was there afterwards, I saw lit streets.</span> <span id="s2100">I never remembered.</span> <span id="s2101">Because as long as I remembered, we always had blackouts.</span> <span id="s2102">We had, you know, when I saw a movie with a neon sign, marquee, I..</span> <span id="s2103">.</span> <span id="s2104">that was really quite able to see that, because you know, all, since ‘38, really, there always was a blackout.</span></p> <p><span id="s2105">Q:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2106">A:And no lights and...</span></p> <p><span id="s2107">Q:Six years already.</span></p> <p><span id="s2108">A:The, always the windows...</span></p> <p><span id="s2109">Q:The curtains.</span></p> <p><span id="s2110">A:Yeah, the black paper, the tar paper on the windows and so...</span></p> <p><span id="s2111">Q:Were you treated decently at the school?</span></p> <p><span id="s2112">A:Yeah, it was O.K., you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2113">Q:Six months of cleaning herring.</span></p> <p><span id="s2114">A:Cleaning herring, and so, and then...</span></p> <p><span id="s2115">Q:What, eight hours a day?</span></p> <p><span id="s2116">A:Yeah, eight hours a day.</span></p> <p><span id="s2117">Q:Did they pay you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2118">A:No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2119">Q:Still no pay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2120">A:No, I got room and board and, you know...</span></p> <p><span id="s2121">Q:And did you make friends with any people there?</span></p> <p><span id="s2122">A:I made friends with a very, very old lady, who was a real heavy old lady.</span> <span id="s2123">She always sat there and her legs were bad and she [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s2124">Q:But not with the other students?</span></p> <p><span id="s2125">A:But then I made friends with a male student, a great friend, who was a German-Jew, who was going to that school there.</span> <span id="s2126">And, well, anyhow, I decided this is not what I’m going to do, not something what I want to do all my life.</span> <span id="s2127">And I applied to nursing school.</span></p> <p><span id="s2128">Q:In Lund?</span></p> <p><span id="s2129">A:Anywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s2130">Q:Oh you just wrote.</span></p> <p><span

I had the same ad in the Jewish Exponent [chuckles] many years later!</span></p> <p><span id="s2134">Q:I see the...origin of that now, Hanna.</span></p> <p><span id="s2135">A:I am going to do for you to pay for my tuition any housework, any work, any for your children.</span> <span id="s2136">And I was accepted in a nursing school, in Norköping, which is north Sweden.</span></p> <p><span

you get there?</span></p> <p><span id="s2145">A:By train, but for hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s2146">Q:Did you get some money for that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2147">A:The Red Cross.</span></p>

head of the Swedish Red Cross, I believe, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2163">A:He started going to the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s2164">And of course now you read papers, now you find out everything which is happening.</span> <span id="s2165">You are now starting to get information.</span> <span id="s2166">I did then contact the Czech government in exile, and I got—and that was really my blessing—I got to a family, a Czech family, Jewish.</span> <span id="s2167">She wasn’t Jewish, but anyhow, we were Jewish, a family.</span></p> <p><span id="s2168">Q:[coughing] excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2169">A:Whose husband, the name was Jakerle [?]</span> <span id="s2170">.</span> <span id="s2171">And he worked at the exile embassy in Stockholm.</span> <span id="s2172">And they lived in Stockholm.</span> <span id="s2173">And through them I was first time, first time, first time accepted somewhere as a member of the family.</span> <span id="s2174">I mean, a true member of the family.</span> <span id="s2175">They had no children.</span> <span id="s2176">At that time I am 18 also.</span> <span id="s2177">They had a lot of contacts.</span> <span id="s2178">No, I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s2179">This is much later.</span> <span id="s2180">This is later.</span> <span id="s2181">This is later.</span> <span id="s2182">This is later.</span> <span id="s2183">This is the end of ‘44 now.</span></p> <p><span id="s2184">Q:So we’ll go back to the nursing school.</span></p> <p><span id="s2185">A:Nursing school.</span></p> <p><span id="s2186">Q:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2187">A:Anyhow, so I get to this nursing school, and I did the same thing.</span> <span id="s2188">Now I stayed there, and I think I got a stipend of 20 kroner.</span> <span id="s2189">I got 20 kroner from the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s2190">And I had the same problem again.</span> <span id="s2191">Now, how do I buy a uniform?</span> <span id="s2192">No money, you know.</span> <span id="s2193">So I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2194">I got some old uniform.</span> <span id="s2195">And the same thing, I kept washing this uniform at night and ironing it in the morning.</span> <span id="s2196">And I..</span> <span id="s2197">.</span></p> <p><span id="s2198">Q:No textbooks.</span></p> <p><span id="s2199">A:No textbooks.</span> <span id="s2200">I still have my Swedish nursing textbook here.</span> <span id="s2201">[chuckles] And, starting to learn the language, which wasn’t really that difficult, but it was different again.</span></p> <p><span id="s2202">Q:You had a new, new life.</span></p> <p><span id="s2203">A:A new language.</span> <span id="s2204">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s2205">Q:You didn’t...</span></p> <p><span id="s2206">A:And they gave me a whole semester tuition free.</span></p> <p><span id="s2207">Q:For...in return for menial work.</span></p> <p><span id="s2208">A:Yeah.</span> <span id="s2209">But they told me the second semester they cannot do it, that I have to get, it wasn’t really that expensive, but it was, you know, you don’t have it, you don’t have it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2210">Q:It’s expensive if you don’t have it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2211">A:Right.</span> <span id="s2212">And the second semester, they told me they cannot do this any more, because, and I either have to come up with the money or quit.</span></p> <p><span id="s2213">Q:You can’t come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s2214">A:Quit.</span> <span id="s2215">So, what I did was that I contacted another hospital, with another nursing school, with the same proposition.</span> <span id="s2216">And I went there, which was in Söderlje.</span> <span id="s2217">And that’s really closer to Stockholm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2218">Q:Would you be good enough to spell that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2219">A:S-Ö-D-E-R-L-J-E, and the O is again umlaut, Söderlje.</span></p> <p><span id="s2220">Q:And that was also in the north?</span></p> <p><span id="s2221">A:But, in the [unclear] was the first time I delivered a baby.</span> <span id="s2222">I helped a, they had midwives.</span> <span id="s2223">They didn’t have obstetricians.</span> <span id="s2224">It was winter.</span> <span id="s2225">It was a hospital sort of out in the country, in the boondocks.</span> <span id="s2226">And I remember women coming like on skis to have their babies delivered.</span></p> <p><span id="s2227">Q:My word!</span> <span id="s2228">And you already became an expert midwife?</span></p> <p><span id="s2229">A:Well, I was in the deliveries.</span> <span id="s2230">And I cried the first time I saw a baby coming.</span> <span id="s2231">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2232">Q:What an experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s2233">A:So...</span></p> <p><span id="s2234">Q:This was also in the north?</span></p> <p><span id="s2235">A:The first time I saw, and now I am able, mind you I am now all of 18, and I’m going to have to change, go to the men’s ward.</span> <span id="s2236">You know, there are not hospitals like this.</span> <span id="s2237">A long ward with one bed next to the other.</span> <span id="s2238">O.K., but when you are working you have this.</span></p> <p><span id="s2239">Q:Was the course work interesting for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2240">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s2241">The nursing work?</span></p> <p><span id="s2242">Q:The nursing work, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2243">A:Yes, I liked it, yeah.</span> <span id="s2244">I really liked it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2245">Q:You liked that.</span> <span id="s2246">And the people...</span></p> <p><span id="s2247">A:Also, you know, and there...were not many avenues for a woman, you know?</span> <span id="s2248">You’re either a maid or you’re a nurse or...</span></p> <p><span id="s2249">Q:[unclear]</span></p> <p><span id="s2250">A:[unclear] you couldn’t be, and there was no, not that much.</span></p> <p><span id="s2251">Q:Very limited opportunities.</span></p> <p><span id="s2252">A:Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2253">Q:Were the people there kindly disposed toward you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2254">A:Yeah.</span> <span id="s2255">I think so.</span> <span id="s2256">I made good friends with a..</span> <span id="s2257">.</span></p> <p><span id="s2258">Q:Good friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s2259">A:Norwegian girl.</span> <span id="s2260">I made very good friends there.</span> <span id="s2261">We slept there and it was... And, well anyhow, so then I went to another hospital, with this, on the same premise.</span> <span id="s2262">And I was there one semester.</span> <span id="s2263">But our shifts were 12-hour shifts, not 8-hour shifts.</span> <span id="s2264">It was from 8:00 in the morning to 8:00 at night, from 8:00 at night to 8:00 in the morning.</span> <span id="s2265">The shifts were only two shifts.</span> <span id="s2266">No, three, like here.</span> <span id="s2267">I think that has changed.</span> <span id="s2268">After we were only two shifts always.</span></p> <p><span id="s2269">Q:And was it [unclear]...</span></p> <p><span id="s2270">A:[unclear] something...</span></p> <p><span id="s2271">Q:Contact?</span></p> <p><span id="s2272">A:Something.</span> <span id="s2273">I’m sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s2274">Q:Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s2275">A:After this school, and after cleaning the fish- Tape 3 of 3, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s2276">Q:Continuing the interview with Mrs. Hanna Seckel.</span> <span id="s2277">This is tape three, side one.</span> <span id="s2278">Yes, you wanted to insert something after the fish cleaning job.</span></p> <p><span id="s2279">A:Yeah.</span> <span id="s2280">In Sweden.</span></p> <p><span id="s2281">Q:In Sweden.</span></p> <p><span id="s2282">A:Before I went to nursing school in Norköping, I went to work in a nursing home which was sponsored by, I think, the Jewish Agency, which were like the Danish people who escaped to Sweden who were elderly and ill.</span> <span id="s2283">And it was sort of like a stopover for them.</span> <span id="s2284">And I worked there and at that time, the invasion of Normandy took place.</span></p> <p><span id="s2285">Q:I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2286">A:And I remember buying myself a big chocolate bar and giving all the patients big chocolate bars because I think that was the greatest thing that has happened in all these years.</span></p> <p><span id="s2287">Q:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2288">A:And from then on I really was hoping maybe, thinking maybe the war is going to be over in a week, in a day, and hoping that starting to get some kind of information from home, which didn’t happen.</span> <span id="s2289">And when the nursing home then was, well, in the nursing home, I started to apply to nursing schools.</span> <span id="s2290">That’s all.</span> <span id="s2291">I just wanted to say that.</span> <span id="s2292">Because the invasion of Normandy took place at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2293">Q:It’s a very important, memorable date.</span></p> <p><span id="s2294">A:Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2295">Q:And so, you had said earlier that, was it late ‘44 you began making inquiries of the Czech government in exile to try to find some Czech families in Sweden?</span></p> <p><span id="s2296">A:Yeah, Czech families.</span> <span id="s2297">And you know, on the whole, because they also had a lot of contact with the British and so on.</span> <span id="s2298">And as I said before, the young men, the chaverim now, they were 18 or 19, they started, enlisted into the British Army.</span> <span id="s2299">And that I found out through the Czech Embassy in exile at that time.</span> <span id="s2300">Another time I was trying to get in touch with the chaverim but they were scattered all over.</span> <span id="s2301">The boys were in England where some of the girls went with them because their romance is starting to blossom out at that time.</span> <span id="s2302">And however, I was stuck way up there in the north of Sweden and not having money to take a train or a bus or anything like that.</span> <span id="s2303">I just stuck it out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2304">Q:And you...were out of touch, then.</span></p> <p><span id="s2305">A:I was completely, completely out of touch until 1972.</span> <span id="s2306">Believe that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2307">Q:My, oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s2308">A:Yeah, out of that.</span> <span id="s2309">Anyhow, it’s so, right, so from Norköping I went to another hospital with the same agreement.</span> <span id="s2310">And that was in [unclear].</span> <span id="s2311">It was an hour away from Stockholm [unclear].</span> <span id="s2312">And then I got sick.</span> <span id="s2313">I got a ruptured appendix and so was quite ill there.</span> <span id="s2314">And the thing was this same thing it was...</span></p> <p><span id="s2315">Q:You still hadn’t gotten a nursing certificate?</span></p> <p><span id="s2316">A:No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2317">Q:The same thing...</span></p> <p><span id="s2318">A:The semester was over, and I got a job and now I really wanted money.</span></p> <p><span id="s2319">Q:Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s2320">A:I wanted some kind of money.</span> <span id="s2321">And also, all, every hospital had a different uniform so you had to, so I decided to go and work for money and I went to an insane asylum to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s2322">Q:Oh my dear.</span></p> <p><span id="s2323">A:Which was near Uppsala.</span> <span id="s2324">And Uppsala is the old university which here they call it Uppsal.</span></p> <p><span id="s2325">Q:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2326">A:But it’s Uppsala.</span> <span id="s2327">And it was called Ullerokes.</span> <span id="s2328">We were Rokes Hospital and that was like 20 miles out of Uppsala.</span> <span id="s2329">It was a big insane asylum there.</span> <span id="s2330">And I worked in the, well, they stuck me right away into the very, very...</span></p> <p><span id="s2331">Q:Violent.</span></p> <p><span id="s2332">A:Violent ward, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2333">Q:Oh my dear.</span></p> <p><span id="s2334">A:But, I got paid.</span></p> <p><span id="s2335">Q:This was 1945 by then?</span></p> <p><span id="s2336">A:That’s ‘44, ‘45.</span></p> <p><span id="s2337">Q:Still ‘44.</span></p> <p><span id="s2338">A:‘44, ‘45 I was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2339">Q:How did you handle them, Hanna?</span> <span id="s2340">Were they giving...</span></p> <p><span id="s2341">A:With difficulty.</span></p> <p><span id="s2342">Q:Were they giving them, they weren’t giving drugs yet, were they?</span></p> <p><span id="s2343">A:No.</span> <span id="s2344">But they were getting shock treatments.</span></p> <p><span id="s2345">Q:Shock treatment.</span> <span id="s2346">My, my, my.</span></p> <p><span id="s2347">A:So I worked there and I celebrated my 20th birthday down there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2348">Q:All alone still.</span></p> <p><span id="s2349">A:Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2350">Q:How long did you stay?</span></p> <p><span id="s2351">A:And at that time I started, well being in Sweden, and being...in a country which is, as we said before, with sexual...</span></p> <p><span id="s2352">Q:[unclear]</span></p> <p><span id="s2353">A:relations, I started to think, I’m 20 and I still know nothing, as far as sexual life is concerned.</span> <span id="s2354">And, but I really wouldn’t even say I wasn’t interested in men.</span> <span id="s2355">It was just...</span></p> <p><span id="s2356">Q:No opportunity.</span></p> <p><span id="s2357">A:There was no opportunity.</span> <span id="s2358">There was no, maybe not a need, there was not a..</span> <span id="s2359">.</span></p> <p><span id="s2360">Q:And you were out of your milieu.</span></p> <p><span id="s2361">A:Yeah.</span> <span id="s2362">It wasn’t my thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2363">Q:Your old friends...</span></p> <p><span id="s2364">A:But I remember my 20th birthday, when I thought, my gosh, you know, I don’t even know...</span></p> <p><span id="s2365">Q:A young man.</span></p> <p><span id="s2366">A:A young man.</span> <span id="s2367">I never had a, well, I had a romance when I was 14, and I started thinking about myself a little more than a machine who works and maybe started thinking what’s all about that, a young woman, you know, who, maybe my needs started to coming out, having some kind of a close relationship.</span> <span id="s2368">But it didn’t come about, and I think that too passed.</span> <span id="s2369">But I really do remember my, when I was 20 I was starting, thinking a little, you know, what...is going to be as far as me, my femininity is concerned.</span></p> <p><span id="s2370">Q:Did you have any days off at this institution?</span> <span id="s2371">And how could you spend them, if you knew some people or...</span></p> <p><span id="s2372">A:I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2373">I had a bicycle.</span> <span id="s2374">And I would go to the Uppsala University.</span> <span id="s2375">And so I go to the Uppsala University and I find out that one of the chaverim is a student there...</span></p> <p><span id="s2376">Q:I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2377">A:Whose name is now, his name was Hardie Burger.</span> <span id="s2378">His name is Daniel Alon, whom I wrote down, and he is a, the professor of archaeology in Jerusalem University.</span> <span id="s2379">And he is very famous for soil conservation in Israel.</span> <span id="s2380">So...</span></p> <p><span id="s2381">Q:You made contact with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2382">A:I made contact with him.</span> <span id="s2383">And he was one of them who did not go to England, for some reason.</span> <span id="s2384">However, his sister, I think, was in England.</span> <span id="s2385">And his sister eventually married an Israeli who became a diplomat in Norway.</span> <span id="s2386">But he left like very shortly after that also.</span></p> <p><span id="s2387">Q:So that...</span></p> <p><span id="s2388">A:So, as far, you know, my romantic life, or anything like that in my...</span></p> <p><span id="s2389">Q:Very [unclear]...</span></p> <p><span id="s2390">A:Normal...</span></p> <p><span id="s2391">Q:Development.</span></p> <p><span id="s2392">A:Development, sort of was always stagnated.</span> <span id="s2393">But I didn’t feel it that it did.</span></p> <p><span id="s2394">Q:Did you take some courses at the University or did you just audit?</span></p> <p><span id="s2395">A:Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2396">Q:You audited.</span></p> <p><span id="s2397">A:I just audited.</span></p> <p><span id="s2398">Q:You...had already learned the language.</span></p> <p><span id="s2399">A:Oh yeah, well I was in school, in nursing school already for years.</span></p> <p><span id="s2400">Q:In the nursing school, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2401">A:O.</span> <span id="s2402">K., one nursing school here and one nursing school there.</span> <span id="s2403">It’s just, so, and that, and I got my, what they call, not a diploma, but after 18 months you get like a..</span> <span id="s2404">.</span></p> <p><span id="s2405">Q:Certificate?</span></p> <p><span id="s2406">A:Certificate, and a cross, a silver cross.</span> <span id="s2407">You could wear out your uniform before you...</span></p> <p><span id="s2408">Q:Certifying that you were a nurse.</span></p> <p><span id="s2409">A:Certifying, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2410">Q:And how long did you stay in the insane asylum?</span></p> <p><span id="s2411">A:Well, now we are ‘45 and the war is over.</span></p> <p><span id="s2412">Q:But you were still in the insane asylum?</span></p> <p><span id="s2413">A:And now the rumor starts going around that those who escaped from Denmark, and they go back to Denmark now, will become automatically Danish citizens.</span></p> <p><span id="s2414">Q:I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2415">A:And that was a big thing with me, because I was a citizen of nothing.</span> <span id="s2416">I had no citizenship.</span> <span id="s2417">And, you know, a human being consists of what is all in paperwork.</span> <span id="s2418">And if you don’t have paperwork...</span></p> <p><span id="s2419">Q:Especially in Europe, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2420">A:Especially in Europe.</span> <span id="s2421">And Sweden was...very, very strict about these things.</span></p> <p><span id="s2422">Q:Is that so?</span></p> <p><span id="s2423">A:It’s, for us, for all the immigrants now, this is what was very difficult for me when I was cleaning the fish in the school.</span> <span id="s2424">It took months before I got a permit from the police to be something else than a fish cleaner.</span> <span id="s2425">You always had to stay within the profession.</span> <span id="s2426">You had to have somebody to vouch for you, and I had no one, to go like to nursing school.</span> <span id="s2427">And it also took you a police permit to move from one place to the other.</span> <span id="s2428">So, this is where you always stayed, within your...</span></p> <p><span id="s2429">Q:Bounds, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2430">A:Whatever were your boundaries, with your trade, or what not, because it was...</span></p> <p><span id="s2431">Q:How could you...</span></p> <p><span id="s2432">A:Practically impossible to climb.</span> <span id="s2433">And so now this thing comes that you can become a citizen, if you return at a certain time, which I did.</span> <span id="s2434">But I want to retrack a little.</span> <span id="s2435">I, the Czech family in Stockholm, which I mentioned the husband who worked for the Czech government in exile, really took to me.</span> <span id="s2436">They were very, really good to me.</span> <span id="s2437">And through them I met like the Czech community there.</span> <span id="s2438">It was not necessarily all Jewish.</span> <span id="s2439">Some of them escaped from the Nazis and so on.</span> <span id="s2440">But there was a culture, finally, which I thought I, they used to give me tickets to go to concerts and I’d go to theater.</span> <span id="s2441">I went first time to a museum in a hundred years.</span> <span id="s2442">And it, I..</span> <span id="s2443">.</span></p> <p><span id="s2444">Q:Oh, what a [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s2445">A:I was invited for dinner where the table was set, the first time.</span> <span id="s2446">You know, so, and...</span></p> <p><span id="s2447">Q:Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2448">A:They gave me a present on my birthday.</span></p> <p><span id="s2449">Q:Yes, you could speak Czech finally.</span></p> <p><span id="s2450">A:Or something very nice.</span> <span id="s2451">And I sort of was eating all this up.</span> <span id="s2452">And I think I was good for them too, because they had no children and they felt they were doing something for me.</span> <span id="s2453">But our friendship remained.</span> <span id="s2454">I mean, and they had a summer house.</span> <span id="s2455">I used to go out there with them to their summer house.</span> <span id="s2456">And they had a dog.</span> <span id="s2457">I used to play with the dog.</span> <span id="s2458">It was like a normal life!</span></p> <p><span id="s2459">Q:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2460">A:A normal family life.</span></p> <p><span id="s2461">Q:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2462">A:Yeah, I had somewhere to go on the weekend.</span> <span id="s2463">So, and this is the outfit I got.</span> <span id="s2464">She made me this.</span> <span id="s2465">This is still from her.</span></p> <p><span id="s2466">Q:Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2467">A:As a tea cozy.</span> <span id="s2468">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s2469">Q:You’re still in touch?</span></p> <p><span id="s2470">A:Well, they’re both dead now.</span> <span id="s2471">See, she, he died in Sweden and she came to live with me and she dissolved the house in Sweden, came to live with me, went to visit somebody in Seattle, and met somebody and married there.</span> <span id="s2472">And then she died, you know, shortly after that.</span> <span id="s2473">He, but she lived with me quite a while here.</span> <span id="s2474">And she was an author.</span> <span id="s2475">She wrote several books.</span> <span id="s2476">And through her I met other people in literature who were authors, and musicians, who were their friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s2477">Q:A stimulating circle for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2478">A:So, it was...nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s2479">Q:Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2480">A:It was very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s2481">Q:Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2482">A:So that émigré society of course were all these artists and authors...</span></p> <p><span id="s2483">Q:Intellectuals, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2484">A:Were, and the, yeah...</span></p> <p><span id="s2485">Q:Yes.</span> <span id="s2486">Had any of them known your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s2487">A:No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2488">Q:No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2489">A:No, no.</span> <span id="s2490">So, that was a..</span> <span id="s2491">.</span></p> <p><span id="s2492">Q:And you went back to Denmark.</span> <span id="s2493">When?</span></p> <p><span id="s2494">A:I went back to Denmark, and now we were interned in Denmark again.</span> <span id="s2495">We got to Denmark and we were interned for one week again in a school and slept on the floor and so on.</span> <span id="s2496">But, the rumor wasn’t true.</span> <span id="s2497">We didn’t get any citizenship.</span></p> <p><span id="s2498">Q:You didn’t get your citizenship.</span></p> <p><span id="s2499">A:And nobody knew who started the rumors.</span></p> <p><span id="s2500">Q:Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s2501">A:Now we are in ‘45.</span> <span id="s2502">But I got a job pretty fast.</span> <span id="s2503">I got a job in a restitution office.</span></p> <p><span id="s2504">Q:Office.</span></p> <p><span id="s2505">A:[pause] Which was really nice.</span> <span id="s2506">It was the first time I took courses in typing and I worked there and did a lot of translating and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s2507">Q:This was for applicants, Danish-Jewish applicants for restitution, because of...</span></p> <p><span id="s2508">A:Restitution, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2509">Q:Their internment.</span></p> <p><span id="s2510">A:It’s called Zentralkontore.</span></p> <p><span id="s2511">Q:And so you were earning a little money.</span></p> <p><span id="s2512">A:I was earning money.</span> <span id="s2513">I got myself a room, with a Jewish family who had a retarded child and I took care of the child for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2514">Q:This was in Copenhagen?</span></p> <p><span id="s2515">A:That’s in, now...I’m in Copenhagen.</span></p> <p><span id="s2516">Q:Finally in the city.</span></p> <p><span id="s2517">A:Yeah, in the city, yeah.</span> <span id="s2518">And I’m eating it all up.</span></p> <p><span id="s2519">Q:And that must, oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2520">A:It’s ‘45 now.</span> <span id="s2521">And I worked there.</span> <span id="s2522">And in 1946 I decided to go back home.</span> <span id="s2523">And that’s the end of my story.</span></p> <p><span id="s2524">Q:You heard nothing about the fate of your parents specifically?</span></p> <p><span id="s2525">A:Well, I went back home in ‘46...</span></p> <p><span id="s2526">Q:To Prague?</span></p> <p><span id="s2527">A:To Prague.</span> <span id="s2528">And my uncle, who was in Russia, he did survive.</span> <span id="s2529">He came back.</span> <span id="s2530">And at that time he made the military his career.</span> <span id="s2531">He became a real ardent Communist.</span> <span id="s2532">Is this off?</span></p> <p><span id="s2533">Q:We can turn it off.</span></p> <p><span id="s2534">A:[tape off then on] And he has an interesting story too, which I find interesting.</span> <span id="s2535">But during the whole course of the war and, I mean, during the course in Sweden and all this, I really lost contact of all the chaverim.</span> <span id="s2536">They were, all after the war, they’re all all spread out.</span> <span id="s2537">I was not, and I think, I don’t know why, but I was the only one who sort of lost contact.</span> <span id="s2538">Because I was, in ‘43 the person who was supposed to contact me to escape didn’t, and they all escaped in one group.</span> <span id="s2539">And I never, never contacted them again until in the ‘70s.</span></p> <p><span id="s2540">Q:They had no way of getting to you...</span></p> <p><span id="s2541">A:And they did not know where I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s2542">Q:Once you went down to the farms.</span></p> <p><span id="s2543">A:Where I was, right.</span> <span id="s2544">And this was...</span></p> <p><span id="s2545">Q:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2546">A:In ‘72, ten years ago, when I contacted them again.</span> <span id="s2547">I want to go to my uncle.</span> <span id="s2548">In the beginning I said my mother was out of seven and my father was out of three.</span> <span id="s2549">Nobody survived, except my uncle, and my aunt on my father’s side who married a Gentile, who never let go of her.</span> <span id="s2550">He was actually the first, he was the one who went before her, because he didn’t want to divorce her.</span> <span id="s2551">They had a daughter, whom they put into a convent, who...</span></p> <p><span id="s2552">Q:Survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s2553">A:Survived.</span> <span id="s2554">I’m in touch with her.</span> <span id="s2555">My aunt and uncle on my father’s side, they came both back, but he contracted bone tuberculosis, and he died not long after liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s2556">Q:They were in Theresienstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s2557">A:And he was in a work camp.</span> <span id="s2558">She was in Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s2559">And she lived until, she was a young woman, a young woman, well, she was my age.</span></p> <p><span id="s2560">Q:Well...</span></p> <p><span id="s2561">A:But she died in the ‘60s.</span> <span id="s2562">My uncle, who was the youngest of the seven children, he was the only boy, he came back from Russia.</span> <span id="s2563">He made military his career, an ardent Communist.</span> <span id="s2564">He had a marvelous life.</span> <span id="s2565">He had a pheasant under the glass and the caviar on the table.</span> <span id="s2566">In 1966—he’s a General now—and he is a specialist in strategic command, whatever this means.</span></p> <p><span id="s2567">Q:In Czechoslovakia?</span></p> <p><span id="s2568">A:In Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s2569">He also lectures at the military academy.</span> <span id="s2570">He is a professor there at the military academy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2571">Q:Do you hear from him, Hanna?</span></p> <p><span id="s2572">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2573">Q:You do.</span></p> <p><span id="s2574">A:Oh yes.</span> <span id="s2575">At that time, I didn’t.</span> <span id="s2576">I did hear from him through a contact.</span> <span id="s2577">But he would never write directly to me.</span> <span id="s2578">In 1946 when I came back, he, because he had the military uniform—and that means a lot in Europe, to run around with a military uniform—he could rescue little things which my parents hid with the Gentile people, and thus I had that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2579">Q:I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2580">A:And the letters.</span> <span id="s2581">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s2582">Q:Their, the apartment was still pretty much intact?</span></p> <p><span id="s2583">A:The apartment was there, but they wouldn’t let me in when I saw it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2584">Q:They wouldn’t let you in.</span></p> <p><span id="s2585">A:And, right.</span> <span id="s2586">And I stayed in Czechoslovakia for one year.</span></p> <p><span id="s2587">Q:Where did you live, Hanna?</span></p> <p><span id="s2588">A:I lived with my aunt, and with my cousin.</span> <span id="s2589">And I went to the university.</span> <span id="s2590">I had an exam and I went to Charles University.</span></p> <p><span id="s2591">Q:I see.</span> <span id="s2592">How was life there for Jews in ‘46, ‘47?</span> <span id="s2593">Of course there were so few Jews left.</span></p> <p><span id="s2594">A:There were so few Jews, and it was irrelevant.</span> <span id="s2595">It was...</span></p> <p><span id="s2596">Q:The Communists had not yet taken over, had they?</span></p> <p><span id="s2597">A:No.</span> <span id="s2598">Well, you see, I was there while the Communistic coup took place.</span> <span id="s2599">So then I went back to Denmark again.</span></p> <p><span id="s2600">Q:I see.</span> <span id="s2601">But in ‘46 it was still...</span></p> <p><span id="s2602">A:Yeah, but, ‘46 and by then the Communists took over while I was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2603">Q:‘47, ‘48.</span></p> <p><span id="s2604">A:Yeah.</span> <span id="s2605">And I went back to Denmark.</span></p> <p><span id="s2606">Q:To Denmark.</span> <span id="s2607">How was life at the university while you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s2608">A:It was fine.</span> <span id="s2609">There was a professor who lectured who also lived in Denmark for a while and...</span></p> <p><span id="s2610">Q:You found some friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s2611">A:I found some friends.</span> <span id="s2612">I lived with my aunt and I was trying to, I was really busy trying to find some contact about the survived people.</span> <span id="s2613">I was running to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s2614">I took the train, I took the bus, running to Theresienstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s2615">Q:You did go there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2616">A:To look at that.</span> <span id="s2617">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s2618">Q:What did you major...</span></p> <p><span id="s2619">A:I wanted to get a, some kind of a death certificate.</span> <span id="s2620">I wanted to do something with some insurance and all these paper, paper, paper things.</span> <span id="s2621">And my uncle...</span></p> <p><span id="s2622">Q:Helped you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2623">A:Was quite helpful in that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2624">Q:He was already leaning toward Communism?</span></p> <p><span id="s2625">A:Oh, he was...</span></p> <p><span id="s2626">Q:A committed Communist.</span></p> <p><span id="s2627">A:[unclear]</span></p> <p><span id="s2628">Q:He was committed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2629">A:He was an absolutely committed Communist.</span> <span id="s2630">In 1966—this is my uncle’s story, not mine—he gets a call from the military headquarters.</span> <span id="s2631">In 24 hours he is going to Cairo to teach the Egyptians tactics against the Jews in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s2632">Q:Oh my.</span> <span id="s2633">Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s2634">A:O.</span> <span id="s2635">K.?</span> <span id="s2636">He is to teach them, well, anyway.</span> <span id="s2637">Well, it wasn’t spelled out that way but that’s the way he told it to me later.</span> <span id="s2638">And now all these years nobody knew he was Jewish.</span> <span id="s2639">[pause] And he married a Gentile woman.</span> <span id="s2640">And he didn’t want to have that much with it to do either.</span> <span id="s2641">He was 15, I think, when he left, when the war started.</span> <span id="s2642">And he walked all the way through Poland.</span> <span id="s2643">He walked all the way to Russia, all by foot.</span> <span id="s2644">It took him a couple of years.</span> <span id="s2645">And it really didn’t mean that much.</span> <span id="s2646">Communism was his religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s2647">Q:He didn’t have any feeling about...</span></p> <p><span id="s2648">A:He didn’t have any feeling about it, but...</span></p> <p><span id="s2649">Q:The Jewish State?</span></p> <p><span id="s2650">A:Yet when I was home, I went to see my rabbi from way back who married my parents and all this, who survived the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s2651">He was at that time blind and he was in his 80’s, but he did survive.</span> <span id="s2652">And my uncle took me to see him.</span> <span id="s2653">But that’s about it.</span> <span id="s2654">He did not have any, at least overtly, he never expressed any feelings.</span></p> <p><span id="s2655">Q:Expressed it, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2656">A:Yeah, Communism took over.</span></p> <p><span id="s2657">Q:Well he was just a child when he left.</span></p> <p><span id="s2658">A:And, but I was in a Zionistic atmosphere and Jewish atmosphere so for me it was different.</span> <span id="s2659">So 1966 he gets a call that he has to go to Egypt.</span> <span id="s2660">And they knew that they are going to proclaim a war against Israel.</span> <span id="s2661">And he is going to instruct the Egyptian Army, whatever.</span> <span id="s2662">And suddenly the wheels started going in his head.</span> <span id="s2663">And that’s what he told me.</span> <span id="s2664">He says, “What am I going to do?</span> <span id="s2665">Slaughter my people again who have been slaughtered?</span> <span id="s2666">Am I going to be responsible?</span> <span id="s2667">But I am a military man.</span> <span id="s2668">You know, even in this army you don’t say no.</span> <span id="s2669">You can’t.</span> <span id="s2670">Well I’m not going to admit that I am Jewish.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2671">Q:Mmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2672">A:And he accepted that, he encountered a tremendous, did not know, really did not know what to do.</span> <span id="s2673">He couldn’t say no, and he knew that he cannot teach wrong.</span> <span id="s2674">And of course he says, “I wrote my lectures the other way around,” or something, you know.</span> <span id="s2675">He’s stalling it and so on.</span> <span id="s2676">And you see how fate does catch up with you, right?</span> <span id="s2677">Or your background catches up with you.</span> <span id="s2678">All that.</span> <span id="s2679">Most unexpected circumstances, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2680">Q:He did go to Cairo?</span></p> <p><span id="s2681">A:No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2682">Q:He didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s2683">A:The interesting part of it is that neither the Russian nor the Czech Army ever ever dug into his background.</span> <span id="s2684">The Arabs did.</span> <span id="s2685">The Egyptians did.</span></p> <p><span id="s2686">Q:How ironic.</span></p> <p><span id="s2687">A:They went to the town where he was born, the same town I was born.</span> <span id="s2688">They went to interview the people who were the neighbors.</span> <span id="s2689">And they were told that they never came back after the war.</span> <span id="s2690">They never got any really proof.</span> <span id="s2691">That’s my uncle saying.</span> <span id="s2692">Although I think they must have because if they got into the records to the Jewish community, records which were kept, they must have found his birth certificate.</span> <span id="s2693">Because he never changed his name.</span> <span id="s2694">My mother’s maiden name was not...typically like Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s2695">Q:Jewish, so...</span></p> <p><span id="s2696">A:[unclear] could have been anything, O.K.?</span></p> <p><span id="s2697">Q:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2698">A:Neither was mine, really, the maiden name was not Jewish, really Jewish either.</span> <span id="s2699">It could be anything.</span> <span id="s2700">So it was not like, you know, something which you know is definitely Jewish.</span> <span id="s2701">And like two days, 48 hours, he told me, before he was called into the headquarters again, and they said they are sending somebody else, which was one of his brilliant students they were sending.</span></p> <p><span id="s2702">Q:How ironic.</span></p> <p><span id="s2703">A:So he got off the hook that way.</span> <span id="s2704">But he was saying, you know, “If I didn’t, if the Arabs didn’t, I really...”</span></p> <p><span id="s2705">Q:He would have gone...</span></p> <p><span id="s2706">A:“I would have to do it.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2707">Q:“To...go to war against Israel.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2708">A:But he never became, I mean after that, even that experience didn’t teach him that he is going to...</span></p> <p><span id="s2709">Q:Change the course of his life.</span></p> <p><span id="s2710">A:No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2711">Q:No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2712">A:No.</span> <span id="s2713">He is still alive.</span> <span id="s2714">He is...only a couple of years older than I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s2715">Q:What he has watched the Communists do to Jewish life, one wonders.</span></p> <p><span id="s2716">A:It doesn’t faze him.</span> <span id="s2717">It does not faze him.</span> <span id="s2718">He is...retired, a retired General.</span> <span id="s2719">He’s retired as a professor of strategic command.</span> <span id="s2720">And the military academy in Brno sends, the people from Cuba come there to study, people from El Salvador, now all these South American countries they come and study there.</span> <span id="s2721">The guerrilla warfare there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2722">Q:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2723">A:And he is lecturing that.</span> <span id="s2724">You know, El Salvador is another thing.</span> <span id="s2725">I think [unclear].</span> <span id="s2726">But he is retired now, and what, he gets retirement from both places.</span> <span id="s2727">What he does, he takes tours.</span> <span id="s2728">He’s like the constant tour guide into Russia.</span> <span id="s2729">He takes people who go...</span></p> <p><span id="s2730">Q:I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2731">A:So he is very much sold on Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s2732">Q:The “good life,” in quotation marks.</span></p> <p><span id="s2733">A:Yeah.</span> <span id="s2734">He...does live a good life.</span></p> <p><span id="s2735">Q:Hanna, what did you feel in ‘47 that made you return to Denmark?</span> <span id="s2736">What was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s2737">A:All right, O.K., first of all, I didn’t think that I really, when I got there, I wanted to leave that same day.</span> <span id="s2738">There was, if it weren’t for my aunt who was there, and my uncle who was there, I felt nothing.</span> <span id="s2739">I did not feel I belonged.</span> <span id="s2740">I just didn’t feel, I..</span> <span id="s2741">.</span> <span id="s2742">didn’t.</span> <span id="s2743">I went to the house we lived in.</span> <span id="s2744">I went to that school I went in.</span> <span id="s2745">I went to the shul.</span> <span id="s2746">I felt that’s...not me.</span> <span id="s2747">That’s not for me.</span> <span id="s2748">This is not my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s2749">Q:Ghosts.</span></p> <p><span id="s2750">A:But I don’t know where my life is.</span> <span id="s2751">I don’t know what my life is.</span> <span id="s2752">But I know this is not it.</span> <span id="s2753">Because I feel worse being a stranger here than being a stranger in a strange land, or in Denmark, or in Sweden, which I knew.</span> <span id="s2754">But it is a stranger feeling to be a stranger at home than be a stranger in a strange place.</span> <span id="s2755">And I figure I want to get this degree, because the education was free, number one.</span> <span id="s2756">Number two, I still had all these ends to tie.</span> <span id="s2757">Number three, I wanted to spend some time with my relatives, the few.</span> <span id="s2758">And I think the main thing was that I wanted to get a degree.</span></p> <p><span id="s2759">Q:And you did get it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2760">A:Yeah.</span> <span id="s2761">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s2762">Q:So you left in ‘47.</span></p> <p><span id="s2763">A:Yeah.</span> <span id="s2764">I left in ‘47, went back to Denmark.</span></p> <p><span id="s2765">Q:And what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s2766">A:Oh yeah, that thing was this, yeah, why I did this was that, you see, because I was not a citizen, right, when I didn’t have a passport, I had the Nansen Pass, the stateless passport, which was...</span></p> <p><span id="s2767">Q:Didn’t you get your Czech citizenship back?</span> <span id="s2768">Or didn’t you want it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2769">A:I didn’t even, well see, I never, the passport I emigrated on, the piece of paper which the Nazi gave us was a Jewish passport, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2770">Q:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2771">A:I went through Czechoslovakia on a Danish stateless passport.</span></p> <p><span id="s2772">Q:I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2773">A:Which [pause] I would have become no citizen at all if I didn’t return within six months.</span> <span id="s2774">But I went to the Czech and the Danish Embassy and got it renewed for another six months.</span> <span id="s2775">So, and by that time I knew I am not going to stay.</span> <span id="s2776">I never, never wanted to become a Czech citizen ever again.</span> <span id="s2777">Also, everything was very shabby.</span> <span id="s2778">The Communists were creeping in.</span> <span id="s2779">Everybody was, it was the same thing like under the Nazis.</span> <span id="s2780">Everybody was afraid for...of everybody.</span> <span id="s2781">Everybody was whispering under the table.</span> <span id="s2782">Everything was done very secretly.</span></p> <p><span id="s2783">Q:Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2784">A:The tension and the fear...</span></p> <p><span id="s2785">Q:Not...</span></p> <p><span id="s2786">A:You could sweat it.</span> <span id="s2787">You could smell it again.</span> <span id="s2788">You could feel it.</span> <span id="s2789">And I lived in a different land.</span> <span id="s2790">I..</span> <span id="s2791">.</span> <span id="s2792">knew, and also, the consumer goods which, I’m not a materialistic person at all, but I could have had it if I had the money.</span> <span id="s2793">It was there.</span> <span id="s2794">It was available.</span> <span id="s2795">It was for me to see in the shop windows.</span> <span id="s2796">And there it was and everybody was very drab.</span> <span id="s2797">But I think the smell of the fear was worse than anything else.</span> <span id="s2798">And I never...my aunt and my uncle, they wanted me to stay there, because...</span></p> <p><span id="s2799">Q:You were the last in the family for them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2800">A:Yeah, but they had a daughter, Eva, who still I’m in contact with.</span></p> <p><span id="s2801">Q:She’s still in Czechoslovakia?</span></p> <p><span id="s2802">A:Mmm hmm, and she’s a very devout Catholic, because she was raised in a convent and she retained.</span> <span id="s2803">And of course it was a mixed marriage to begin with.</span> <span id="s2804">And so but...</span></p> <p><span id="s2805">Q:She...</span></p> <p><span id="s2806">A:She was a devout Catholic.</span> <span id="s2807">Now she is a devout Communist, in Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s2808">Q:So you returned to Denmark.</span></p> <p><span id="s2809">A:And so I returned to Denmark.</span> <span id="s2810">And I got extremely ill.</span> <span id="s2811">I was very sick.</span> <span id="s2812">I was sick for three months.</span></p> <p><span id="s2813">Q:Who took care of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2814">A:The hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s2815">Q:It was too many shocks, too much.</span> <span id="s2816">It was a breakdown I suppose?</span></p> <p><span id="s2817">A:No, no, it was a physical...</span></p> <p><span id="s2818">Q:Physical.</span></p> <p><span id="s2819">A:Physical, physical state.</span> <span id="s2820">No, I’m pretty strong and...</span></p> <p><span id="s2821">Q:Of course you are.</span></p> <p><span id="s2822">A:And, oh, it’s funny.</span> <span id="s2823">I shouldn’t say that.</span> <span id="s2824">And [pause]...</span></p> <p><span id="s2825">Q:Did you go...</span></p> <p><span id="s2826">A:I went back to Sweden.</span> <span id="s2827">I couldn’t find...</span></p> <p><span id="s2828">Q:You went back to Sweden.</span></p> <p><span id="s2829">A:I went back to Sweden.</span></p> <p><span id="s2830">Q:You couldn’t find a place for yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s2831">A:First of all, there was, the housing was, I couldn’t find a room.</span> <span id="s2832">I couldn’t find a job.</span> <span id="s2833">I was sick for three months.</span> <span id="s2834">I had poisoning, blood poisoning all over my body.</span> <span id="s2835">And...I woke up one day and I thought I, then I took a streetcar to the hospital and I [mumbling].</span> <span id="s2836">Well, anyhow, so that was that.</span> <span id="s2837">And I finally got a room near this train station and [chuckles] I see I’m naive.</span> <span id="s2838">Now I’m 22, almost 22.</span> <span id="s2839">Naive.</span></p> <p><span id="s2840">Q:This is now in Sweden?</span></p> <p><span id="s2841">A:No, that’s in Denmark there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2842">Q:Still in Denmark.</span></p> <p><span id="s2843">A:When I returned to Denmark from Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s2844">I get this room.</span></p> <p><span id="s2845">Tape 3 of 3, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s2846">A:In 1946, before I went to Czechoslovakia, I’m in Copenhagen, and they think that an American big vessel is coming.</span> <span id="s2847">Well, you know, for us, the American was next to God, next to angel.</span> <span id="s2848">And we ran to the lange linie [Copenhagen waterfront] to see this big American ship coming in, American Navy.</span> <span id="s2849">But it was, oh, you know, and well just the naiveté of us standing there, standing at the pier and that ship comes and everybody is just, it’s after the war, but still.</span> <span id="s2850">But it was quite something, you know, to see the Americans who liberated all these people...</span></p> <p><span id="s2851">Q:Yes, a great s________.</span></p> <p><span id="s2852">A:Throughout the war.</span> <span id="s2853">And I am standing there.</span> <span id="s2854">And suddenly this sailor comes, two sailors coming and they grabbed me on each side.</span> <span id="s2855">I did not know, I did not know what they wanted from me.</span> <span id="s2856">I found out the hard way!</span> <span id="s2857">[chuckles] I was so naive!</span> <span id="s2858">Can you believe that?</span> <span id="s2859">All this I went through, I mean I, that field, I was...</span></p> <p><span id="s2860">Q:Still...</span></p> <p><span id="s2861">A:The most naive person.</span></p> <p><span id="s2862">Q:It wasn’t, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2863">A:But anyhow, so, I found out soon enough that, you know, where I rented a room from, on the floor I was... And I wrote to these Czech people in Sweden that I really would like to go back to Sweden.</span></p> <p><span id="s2864">Q:They had remained in Sweden?</span></p> <p><span id="s2865">A:Oh yes, oh yes.</span> <span id="s2866">And I went back to Sweden, and I got a very nice job.</span> <span id="s2867">And I got an apartment and I worked for Aktieboluget Gas Accumulator, was Mr. Nobel, Nobel’s firm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2868">Q:The Nobel of the Nobel Peace Prize?</span></p> <p><span id="s2869">A:And just by [unclear] you know, he invented the dynamite.</span></p> <p><span id="s2870">Q:The dynamite, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2871">A:And that was sort of a very interesting thing that he is given a peace prize.</span> <span id="s2872">And I worked there as a translator, an interpreter in the office, for the, it was an engineering firm, and they did a lot of engineering.</span></p> <p><span id="s2873">Q:Finally you had a job that was really commensurate with your talents.</span></p> <p><span id="s2874">A:And it was very nice.</span> <span id="s2875">I really liked that.</span> <span id="s2876">I made friends.</span> <span id="s2877">I started to go to school to learn English.</span></p> <p><span id="s2878">Q:This was now your ninth language, I suppose.</span></p> <p><span id="s2879">A:However, in 194-, see, my parents had, my grandmother had a step-sister in Cincinnati, Ohio.</span> <span id="s2880">And when this whole thing, Holocaust, broke out, everybody was trying to find a relative who would send you an affidavit.</span> <span id="s2881">And they hemmed and hawed.</span> <span id="s2882">And when they finally decided they are going to do it, it was much, much, much, much too late.</span> <span id="s2883">But in 1945, after the war finished, I went to the American Embassy.</span> <span id="s2884">And I said whether this would be good for me.</span> <span id="s2885">It was not for me, but since, oh, since, I think that I am the sole survivor, whether that would reflect upon me.</span> <span id="s2886">And thus I went to Czechoslovakia in ‘46 and got all these mass death certificates to present to the American Embassy that yes, they are not alive.</span> <span id="s2887">And thus the affidavit would come to me.</span> <span id="s2888">And because I was on a Czech quota, living in Sweden, they took till 1950 before I came here.</span> <span id="s2889">In the meantime, though, I was working in the Gas Accumulator, and when the affidavit finally came, I didn’t want to go.</span> <span id="s2890">Because I really did...</span></p> <p><span id="s2891">Q:You wanted to stay in Sweden.</span></p> <p><span id="s2892">A:I, well, I had a good, I..</span> <span id="s2893">.</span> <span id="s2894">was somebody.</span></p> <p><span id="s2895">Q:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2896">A:I had a good life.</span> <span id="s2897">I have good friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s2898">Q:A good life, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2899">A:I had this family.</span> <span id="s2900">I belonged now to some hiking club and you know, this and this and that.</span> <span id="s2901">And I tour, and also I had to starting saving money to go to this big Atlantic trip.</span></p> <p><span id="s2902">Q:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2903">A:Over the Atlantic Ocean.</span> <span id="s2904">And then I finally decided, well, I learned more English and worse comes to worse I can, I still am no citizen of no country, which meant, well, I have to return within six months.</span> <span id="s2905">If I don’t like it, now I have to have money for two trips...</span></p> <p><span id="s2906">Q:Back and forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s2907">A:Back and forth.</span> <span id="s2908">And well, I came and I never returned.</span> <span id="s2909">I stayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2910">Q:Whom did, you contacted your relatives in Cincinnati, Hanna?</span></p> <p><span id="s2911">A:Yeah, I went to Cincinnati.</span> <span id="s2912">I went to New York, and as a matter of fact, I also found out that my aunt had a sister-in-law in Jackson Heights, New York.</span> <span id="s2913">And I stayed there two days or something.</span> <span id="s2914">And then I had to go.</span> <span id="s2915">At that time it was different than it’s now.</span> <span id="s2916">You had to go to the town or to the city where your sponsor came from.</span></p> <p><span id="s2917">Q:I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2918">A:So I went to Cincinnati, Ohio.</span> <span id="s2919">[chuckles] And, nobody told me that America is so big!</span> <span id="s2920">Even if you see it on the map.</span></p> <p><span id="s2921">Q:[chuckles]</span></p> <p><span id="s2922">A:So I get on the train in New York and think three hours later I’m going to be in Cincinnati.</span></p> <p><span id="s2923">Q:[chuckles]</span></p> <p><span id="s2924">A:So I was in Cincinnati, Ohio.</span></p> <p><span id="s2925">Q:Did you get a cordial reception?</span></p> <p><span id="s2926">A:Well, that was another thing.</span> <span id="s2927">You see, while I was in Sweden, I got in contact with this family Weil.</span> <span id="s2928">And they had a son by the name Joe.</span> <span id="s2929">And they wrote me, in German, that if I marry Joe, pro forma, that I can come to America immediately.</span> <span id="s2930">Well, I didn’t want to do that.</span> <span id="s2931">I..</span> <span id="s2932">.</span> <span id="s2933">my life was not in jeopardy.</span> <span id="s2934">So I say, “I’ll wait my turn.”</span> <span id="s2935">If it takes another year, you know.</span> <span id="s2936">And then I really wasn’t that eager.</span> <span id="s2937">But when I get to Cincinnati, they wanted me to marry Joe for real, you see?</span> <span id="s2938">And I..</span> <span id="s2939">.</span> <span id="s2940">made quite a few boo-boo’s, but that doesn’t belong to that.</span> <span id="s2941">I made [tape off then on] Sweden...</span></p> <p><span id="s2942">Q:A few words about the American experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s2943">A:In Sweden I saved enough money that I decided if I’m leaving Europe I want to see France and England, because I worked in this firm.</span> <span id="s2944">And I got very good friends; I am still in touch with the people who worked, I worked with.</span> <span id="s2945">And so I was in France for a couple weeks, a couple weeks, and England.</span> <span id="s2946">And then I went on the Queen Elizabeth II to America.</span> <span id="s2947">You can edit this if you want.</span> <span id="s2948">I mean you can...</span></p> <p><span id="s2949">Q:Well I just would like to know how you made your way once you had to support yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s2950">A:O.</span> <span id="s2951">K., so then...now, I come to these people and I said to them, “I have this package to deliver to these people.”</span> <span id="s2952">And they said, “You’re not going there.”</span> <span id="s2953">And I says, “Why not?</span> <span id="s2954">I want to call them.”</span> <span id="s2955">They said, “No, you are not calling them.”</span> <span id="s2956">I says, “Why not?”</span> <span id="s2957">And they said, “Well, they are niggers.</span> <span id="s2958">O.K.?</span> <span id="s2959">You are not going to do this.”</span> <span id="s2960">And I says, “Why not?”</span> <span id="s2961">“You do not understand.”</span> <span id="s2962">“Oh no, I am very smart.</span> <span id="s2963">Yes, I understand.”</span> <span id="s2964">“If somebody finds out that...” “No!”</span> <span id="s2965">It was like this.</span> <span id="s2966">I ask him to come and pick it up, and he is telling me he can’t, he can’t come to pick, O.K.?</span> <span id="s2967">And I says, “Why not?”</span> <span id="s2968">He says, “I just can’t.”</span> <span id="s2969">So I tell my relatives, I says, “I am going there, to deliver it.</span> <span id="s2970">How to get there?”</span> <span id="s2971">And they say I can’t, to go there.</span> <span id="s2972">O.K.?</span> <span id="s2973">I’m still figuring out anything.</span> <span id="s2974">I can’t figure this thing out.</span> <span id="s2975">So then finally he says, “Oh, they are niggers.”</span> <span id="s2976">So I says, “So what?”</span> <span id="s2977">You know.</span> <span id="s2978">“You can’t do this.”</span> <span id="s2979">So I decided that I’m going to meet this man, who was the brother of this man, and they are sending Joe, their son, to chaperone me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2980">Q:Mmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2981">A:And, he chaperones me, and I get off the bus.</span> <span id="s2982">And he is on the bus with me.</span> <span id="s2983">And in front of the man he slaps me in the face, Joe, and he says, “I don’t want you to be a nigger lover,” in front of him.</span> <span id="s2984">And I..</span> <span id="s2985">.</span></p> <p><span id="s2986">Q:Oh my.</span> <span id="s2987">This was your introduction...</span></p> <p><span id="s2988">A:I was stubborn.</span> <span id="s2989">And I go with this, this black young man.</span> <span id="s2990">He just wanted to disappear.</span> <span id="s2991">I says, “Oh no,” with my broken English.</span> <span id="s2992">“We are going to have a cup of coffee somewhere.”</span> <span id="s2993">And there was no where to go and have a cup of coffee.</span> <span id="s2994">And he called me, this black man, and invited me to his house.</span> <span id="s2995">And I said it to my relatives, and I came back, and my suitcase was in front of the door.</span> <span id="s2996">And they said they don’t want to see me any more, because their house is going to be burned down.</span> <span id="s2997">And that was, I was here two months.</span> <span id="s2998">I thought I was such a smart alec, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2999">Q:That was your introduction to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s3000">A:Mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3001">Q:Then you went back east to New York?</span> <span id="s3002">You stayed in Cincinnati?</span></p> <p><span id="s3003">A:Mmm, I was looking for a job.</span> <span id="s3004">No, and then I, in the meantime I met a girl from Denmark, a Jewish girl from Denmark who had some relatives there.</span> <span id="s3005">And I said to her...and I got a room for $5 a week.</span> <span id="s3006">I shared a bed.</span> <span id="s3007">And I was looking for a job.</span> <span id="s3008">And since I had a nursing degree, I was looking for Red Cross.</span> <span id="s3009">And the first thing I see in the paper is Blue Cross.</span> <span id="s3010">I thought, Blue Cross, Red Cross, the same thing.</span> <span id="s3011">I go in and apply to Blue Cross for a job, and I was a file clerk.</span> <span id="s3012">And I got the job.</span> <span id="s3013">And I stayed there.</span> <span id="s3014">And then, for a while, and then I got a job in a speech and hearing clinic.</span> <span id="s3015">And then I decided that I hated Cincinnati with a passion.</span> <span id="s3016">In the meantime I met my future husband, which is another story.</span> <span id="s3017">But I, and he was engaged to somebody else, which I did not know.</span> <span id="s3018">And I didn’t like it.</span> <span id="s3019">I probably wouldn’t have liked it anywhere after coming from Sweden.</span> <span id="s3020">I hated the heat.</span> <span id="s3021">I just could not stand the heat.</span> <span id="s3022">Air conditioning didn’t exist at the time.</span> <span id="s3023">You know, the air conditioning, this was ‘50.</span> <span id="s3024">And all I knew about America, what I read, but I always was sort of fascinated by San Francisco.</span> <span id="s3025">And I saved my money, I bought my one-way ticket, and went to San Francisco.</span> <span id="s3026">I stopped by in Colorado.</span> <span id="s3027">I fell in love with Denver.</span> <span id="s3028">I got a, went to the Jewish hospital, got a job in the Jewish hospital in Denver, Colorado.</span> <span id="s3029">I’m staying at the Y for $2 a night.</span> <span id="s3030">Remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3031">Q:[chuckles]</span></p> <p><span id="s3032">A:Alone.</span> <span id="s3033">And the day I was supposed to start the job I called them up and I said, “You know, I still want to go to San Francisco.”</span> <span id="s3034">And I went to San Francisco.</span> <span id="s3035">I stayed there for two years.</span> <span id="s3036">I worked in a hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s3037">Q:That must have been lovely.</span></p> <p><span id="s3038">A:And the man whom I met in Cincinnati came to San Francisco to propose, because his engagement was off.</span> <span id="s3039">And I said, “Only under one condition, that we come to San Francisco.”</span> <span id="s3040">And I never did, I never did again.</span> <span id="s3041">And that’s fate.</span> <span id="s3042">So, I worked in San Francisco.</span> <span id="s3043">At that time I was getting $50 a, $45, no, in Cincinnati I was getting $35 a week.</span> <span id="s3044">And it was a fortune.</span></p> <p><span id="s3045">Q:Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s3046">A:$5 a week was my room.</span> <span id="s3047">I saved in three months to go by train.</span> <span id="s3048">I want on this California Zephyr, by train.</span> <span id="s3049">Oh boy, oh my God, I mean, such a country.</span></p> <p><span id="s3050">Q:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3051">A:I stayed in Salt Lake City, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3052">Q:You saw the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s3053">A:Today the youngsters, they just buy a car and they go.</span></p> <p><span id="s3054">Q:I know, but in those days that was an adventure.</span></p> <p><span id="s3055">A:Yeah.</span> <span id="s3056">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s3057">Q:Thank you so very much, Hanna.</span></p> <p><span id="s3058">A:So there, I don’t know that...</span></p> <p><span id="s3059">Q:This was an extraordinary saga.</span></p> <p><span id="s3060">A:It’s much...</span></p> <p><span id="s3061">Q:Yes, oh, there is much of value and of interest...</span></p> <p><span id="s3062">A:And...</span></p> <p><span id="s3063">Q:That will be important, especially for younger people.</span> <span id="s3064">Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s3065">A:Yeah, it was...</span></p> <p><span id="s3066">Most of the Jews from Czechoslovakia were sent to Theresienstadt and ultimately perished in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s3067">This transport consisted mostly of old people who could not easily hide or be hidden.</span> <span id="s3068">Many of them survived as a result of the continuous intervention of Danish officials and King Christian.</span></p> <p><span id="s3069">USHMM
