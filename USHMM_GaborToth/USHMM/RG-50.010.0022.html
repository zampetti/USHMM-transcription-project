<span id="s5">Could you tell me your full name, please.</span></p> <p><span id="s6">A: Kenneth William Cotton.</span> <span id="s7">Q: And what is your address?</span></p> <p><span id="s8">A: 533 Scott Street in Rippon, Wisconsin.</span> <span id="s9">Q: And when were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s10">A: I was born March 27, 1922.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: And how old were you at the time you went into the armed services?</span> <span id="s12">A: I was 20 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: Were you drafted?</span> <span id="s14">A: I was drafted.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: And what was your prospective profession before you went into the Army?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: I was a repairman in a washing machine factory.</span> <span id="s17">Q: And what kind of occupation do you have today?</span> <span id="s18">A: I am a rural mail carrier.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: Which military unit did you serve with and your rank?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: I was a technician fifth grade with the 62nd Armored Infantry Battalion of the 14th Armored Division.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: Just for the record, were you present at the liberation of any of the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: I was not present at the actual liberation.</span> <span id="s23">I went there as a mechanic.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">I was at the scene after they were liberated, but not at the actual liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: Earlier when we were talking, you described the situation that happened shortly after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: Could you tell me a little bit about what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: After the war ended, our battalion was sent to [unintelligible], Germany which is on the Austrian border.</span> <span id="s29">Our duty was to guard a bridge over the Saale River.</span> <span id="s30">A short time after we got there -- and incidentally we were stationed in the town square in what was called the Opera House, but was in actuality the City Hall -- the discovery was made.</span> <span id="s31">I’m not sure where these bodies were discovered, but there were a number of bodies buried in a common grave that had been executed.</span> <span id="s32">How they were executed, I’m not sure, but they had been executed and buried in a common grave.</span> <span id="s33">The Army exhumed the bodies, put them on trucks, and brought them to Birkhausen to be buried.</span> <span id="s34">They parked the trucks in the town square and the stench was almost unbearable even with the windows closed in our building.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">They took these bodies, dug separate graves for each one, made everybody in the town turn out for the funeral, had services for them, and buried them individually.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: Were you present at the services that were conducted?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: I wasn’t present at the services that were conducted.</span> <span id="s38">A number of our men went to the services, but they just wanted more or less of a representative group from the Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: You wouldn't happen to know off-hand the names of any of the men who might have attended?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: No, I wouldn't.</span> <span id="s41">I'm pretty sure our officers did, but I couldn't say for sure who did attend.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: About how long after the war were these bodies discovered?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: It was probably about a month or two months.</span> <span id="s44">It’s hard to recall exactly, but it was before our outfit was broken up.</span> <span id="s45">They shipped a number of our people out of our division back to join the 45th Division.</span> <span id="s46">A number of us were left there, but I'm sure this was before they shipped the men to the 45th Division.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: What was your reaction?</span> <span id="s48">Do you think this was a good thing that they had done that?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: The only thing I questioned was that perhaps they were punishing some people by forcing them to go to the funeral for something that they didn't have any part in and did not approve of.</span> <span id="s50">Nevertheless, it made an impressive ceremony to have all those people there.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Certainly, a number of them were undoubtedly Nazis or followers of the Nazi political beliefs and probably approved of what had happened, but there were probably some who didn't.</span> <span id="s52">Probably many that didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: Do you think what the Army did in exhuming the bodies and having this funeral was correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: Yes, I think this was correct because, at least in our religious beliefs and everything, we would not approve of a common grave and we gave them some kind of a service which undoubtedly they didn't get when they were executed.</span> <span id="s55">At least, we buried them with a Christian burial, which all of us desire or most of us desire, at least.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: Do you have any idea of what the reaction of the townspeople was?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A, The townspeople, from what we could tell, were reluctant to go, didn’t like the idea, but they went without any violent protest or anything.</span> <span id="s58">I can understand why but they did turn out a couple of the infirm or the children.</span> <span id="s59">They didn't make the children go as I remember.</span> <span id="s60">I think it was just the adults who they made go.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: What was the reaction of the other men in your company or in your platoon?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A, I think that they felt much the same way as I did.</span> <span id="s63">It gave a tribute to these people, at least partially.</span> <span id="s64">Perhaps some of the German people didn't approve of it, of what happened to them either, but they still had to go to the funeral.</span> <span id="s65">I think that most of them felt it was justified because it was the German nation as a whole that was responsible, to a certain extent, for all these things that happened.</span> <span id="s66">Even though they didn't, perhaps, approve of some of these things, they tolerated it.</span> <span id="s67">I think in that sense that the whole German nation had to share in a sense of any guilt.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: It's been almost 34 years, almost to the exact mark.</span> <span id="s69">We're in the middle of July now.</span> <span id="s70">Looking back at it, when we teach children in schools about this history, how should these questions be approached?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: I think these things shouldn't be covered up, that children should be aware of what can happen under a totalitarian rule and under the influence of a person like Adolph Hitler, and not only Adolph Hitler, but the rest of the hierarchy of the Nazi party.</span> <span id="s72">I think it's their duty to see that such a thing can't happen here.</span> <span id="s73">And with our democratic form of government, whether we approve of everything or anything that the President does, it still is the best way to keep something like that from happening.</span> <span id="s74">The President and the Congress have to respond to the wishes of the people to a certain extent because they know that eventually the people are going to rule anyhow, where in Germany, after Hitler took over, it was only a small group of people who had any say in what was done and people got to the point that there was nothing they could do to stop it.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: Has the event that you lived through in the Army and the things that you saw, such as this funeral in this town, affected your life in any particular way or your philosophy?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A, Not me.</span> <span id="s77">I don't think it has really affected my life.</span> <span id="s78">I think my attitude toward such things hasn't changed.</span> <span id="s79">It certainly has given me a better understanding of what did happen because in a lot of people's minds there are doubts about whether some of these things are being exaggerated or not.</span> <span id="s80">I think that in many cases the news media and various scholars have downplayed what happened and after the passage of time, they are trying to soft pedal it a little bit.</span> <span id="s81">But I think we should be aware of what can happen and what did happen and just to be sure that it doesn't happen again.</span> <span id="s82">As a matter of fact, now they are having this same problem in other countries.</span> <span id="s83">If it could happen in Germany at that time, it is certainly happening in these countries and there's no denying that it can happen if the people aren't responsible enough to see that it doesn't happen to begin with, that the nation doesn't get in such position that it can happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: When you say it's happening in other countries, do you have any particular areas in mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: There are atrocities that are happening in Africa that are pretty well documented and in the Middle East.</span> <span id="s86">I think that there is no doubt about the things that are happening there -- the mass murders, the political executions that have taken place there.</span> <span id="s87">It's the same type of thing.</span> <span id="s88">People are killed without trial, without really any provocation, and I think it's against the American way of life.</span> <span id="s89">I think we have to realize that these things are happening today, perhaps not in a broader scale, but certainly shouldn't even happen on a small scale.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: Thinking back now, has your opinion of the German nation changed?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A, I think that right now the way the German nation [unintelligible] I think they have learned their lesson.</span> <span id="s92">I think that there's a strange sense of guilt among the older people about what happened and I think that they are trying to keep that from ever happening again.</span> <span id="s93">Wen we were over in Germany last year, I went back to a POW camp.</span> <span id="s94">They still retained some of those barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: Which Prisoner of War camp was that?</span> <span id="s96">A: That was at Moosburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: Moosburg was one of the very large prisoner camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: This was near the end of the war and the Germans were retreating.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">They were taking the prisoners along, marching them along.</span> <span id="s100">They got them as far as Moosburg and they put them in a prison camp there.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">This camp had lots more people than it was designed for because they had brought prisoners from all these other camps into there.</span> <span id="s102">There’s been a lot of estimates about how many there were.</span> <span id="s103">You hear a lot of different figures, but I think the most reliable from what I've been able to gather is somewhere between 120,000 and 200,000 which is supposed to be the largest number of Allied prisoners that were freed in Europe at one time.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: Were you present near or about the time that Moosburg was liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s106">I wasn't in Moosburg but we went through Moosburg the night after the town was freed.</span> <span id="s107">It was like going through Times Square on New Years Eve.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q..</span> <span id="s109">A lot of people milling around?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: I think we moved about two miles an hour going through there because there were so many prisoners of every nationality imaginable.</span> <span id="s111">We were throwing off rations to them.</span> <span id="s112">There were a bunch of Algerian prisoners sitting on our half-track going down the street and they had a box of rations that they were throwing out to the prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: How did you feel going through Moosburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: I was pretty happy to see that many prisoners freed and to think that we had had a hand in freeing them.</span> <span id="s115">There was a feeling of accomplishment to see that we had freed them, knowing that some of the prisoners from our own outfit were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: Had you heard prior to coming to Moosburg either about prisoner of war camps or concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: No, we hadn't heard about them, but I’m sure that Division Intelligence knew they were there.</span> <span id="s118">But there’s a lot of information that doesn't get down to the line of soldiers.</span> <span id="s119">You're told to pursue the Germans in a certain route and that's what you do.</span> <span id="s120">I think it was a surprise to everybody that they freed that many prisoners, although I’m sure that the American Intelligence knew there was a prison camp</span></p> <p><span id="s121">there.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: Were you given any particular instructions beyond just to keep pursuing the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A, No, not our echelon, the troops that were there, because we moved right through and kept on going.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: The passing out of rations as you were moving through was something that was spontaneous?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: Yes, spontaneous.</span> <span id="s126">We were carrying quite a number of rations that were surplus, more or less, and when we saw those guys, we couldn't tell them, "No, you can't have anything."</span> <span id="s127">I think we had a trailer on our half-track and we must have had about 25 or 30 pieces of rations that they couldn't carry on the kitchen truck, so we passed some of them off to some of the prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: How did those men look?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: The ones that we saw looked in pretty good condition.</span> <span id="s130">Of course, a number of them were officers.</span> <span id="s131">They usually kept the officers separated from the enlisted men in prison camps and, in many instances, they did treat the officers probably a little better than the enlisted men.</span> <span id="s132">I didn't see anybody that looked really in bad condition, although perhaps the ones that weren't in good physical condition weren’t up in the town square where we were.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: Did you see any people along the roads or anything that had been liberated from the concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A, No, I didn't see any myself.</span> <span id="s135">We didn't get in to the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s136">At least, my company didn't but we did free two prison camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: The question I would like to ask you is how the things that you saw shortly after the war, such as these people that were reinterred and the things you saw at Moosburg, affected your own faith?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: I don't think it really made a change in my faith but it gave me faith in my own faith that somebody would see that these people got a Christian burial and they were paid the proper respect.</span> <span id="s139">But, actually, to affect my own faith, I couldn't say that I became affected one way or the other too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: If your child said to you that he wanted to be a Nazi, what would your reaction to him be?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A, The first reaction would be anger, probably disappointment, and then I would try to tell him some of the things that happened and I would try to reason with him and tell him things that happened from my own experience, from the experience of others that I talked to, and things that I know about the situation.</span> <span id="s142">I would try to impress upon him what would you do if this happened to you or your family.</span> <span id="s143">Do you still want to be a Nazi?</span> <span id="s144">Is there any way you can justify that?</span> <span id="s145">I guess that's about all any person can do.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: Is there something you would like to add in reflecting about the things you saw?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: I think that these things are resurfacing now.</span> <span id="s148">The showing of the film, Holocaust, has brought the subject up again, and I think it should be done.</span> <span id="s149">Some people have the attitude “It's over.</span> <span id="s150">It's done with.</span> <span id="s151">It happened many years ago.</span> <span id="s152">Let's forget it."</span> <span id="s153">I don’t think we can forget this thing any more than we can forget things like the Civil War or the way the slaves were treated at that time, which the film Roots has brought emphasis to.</span> <span id="s154">I think we have to go back and we have to learn lessons from the past, and every so often we have to have a renewal of a lot of these subjects brought up again and emphasized so we can take a direction to keep these things from happening again.</span> <span id="s155">I think it is proper that they should be taught in the schools, that we should have a certain amount of emphasis on them so that we keep remembering that those things happened and that they can happen again if we aren't vigilant.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: You mentioned the Holocaust TV movie.</span> <span id="s157">Did you see it?</span> <span id="s158">A: Parts of it.</span> <span id="s159">I wasn't able to see it all.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: What did you think about the parts that you saw?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: It made you feel sad but it refreshed those things that happened.</span> <span id="s162">I remember thinking at the time that I hope a lot of young people watch this movie so they will know what happened.</span> <span id="s163">I know what happened and I think most of the people at that time had a pretty good education about what happened, but this upcoming generation has to realize that these things actually did happen, that they are not fairy stories, that they are not things that are exaggerated.</span> <span id="s164">They were really true.</span> <span id="s165">I know I was very interested in what I saw.</span> <span id="s166">I wouldn't say it was entertaining.</span> <span id="s167">It was educational though -- very educational.</span> <span id="s168">.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: You mentioned the Roots and Holocaust TV programs.</span> <span id="s170">Do you think that's an important role for TV to play?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s172">I think TV can be many things.</span> <span id="s173">It should be involved in education.</span> <span id="s174">It should be both entertainment and informational.</span> <span id="s175">You have to have in programs some pure entertainment.</span> <span id="s176">There's a certain amount of time that should be for things that are educational.such as those two programs.</span> <span id="s177">They were stories, but they were certainly educational.</span> <span id="s178">They were factual.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: I'm wondering if as a result of part of those TV programs or the experiences you had your attitudes toward Blacks changed?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A, I don't think so.</span> <span id="s181">I’ve never had any prejudice against Blacks.</span> <span id="s182">Where I live we do not have many Blacks living in our town but I've known a lot of Blacks.</span> <span id="s183">I have been good friends with quite a few Blacks because I'm in a college town and as a side line I write sports for a newspaper, so I get a lot of contact with so many black athletes.</span> <span id="s184">They became good friends of mine and, if somebody mentions them, I have to stop and think sometimes whether they are Black or not.</span> <span id="s185">They are just people.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: How about your attitudes towards Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: I always got along fine.</span> <span id="s188">I worked for a Jew for about 3 or 4 years and always had good relations wi th him.</span> <span id="s189">I've known a lot of Jews and I've never had any animosity toward them.</span> <span id="s190">I've always felt that they were people, there’s no difference.</span> <span id="s191">The Jew I worked for is now a multimillionaire, started out with nothing in 1939 and today is a multimillionaire.</span> <span id="s192">And I'm sure that if I ever wanted to, I could go down and [unintelligible] give me a job and he would do it right now because he feels loyalty to his early employees and the people he associated with when he first got started.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: Were you aware of any Jewish men in your unit?</span> <span id="s194">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s195">We had many -- a good friend of mine.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: Let's say this vignette that we started out with, were their reactions any different from some of the other men in your unit?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: In some instances.</span> <span id="s198">When you go back, look up the story in that history of Ken [unintelligible].</span> <span id="s199">He was in my company.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: A Jewish man?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: Jewish, and here was a man that was one of the most intelligent men in the Company.</span> <span id="s202">He was a crack radio operator, but he was [unintelligible].</span> <span id="s203">He wanted to get out of the Army and he tried everything in the world to try to get out of the Army.</span> <span id="s204">He tried to get what was known as a Section 8, which is a mental, and they knew that he was faking and they finally transferred him into our Company.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">He was under guard a lot of the time doing company punishment and I'll never forget.</span> <span id="s206">When we got ready to go overseas, we shipped from Camp Campbell to Camp Shenks, New York on a train, and each of the FCO’s was assigned a certain compartment and he got put in my compartment.</span> <span id="s207">Everybody was betting that he was going to jump the train because he really wanted to get out of the Army and he was afraid to go overseas.</span> <span id="s208">So I went to him and I said, “Look, everybody is betting you're going to jump the train.</span> <span id="s209">I can't watch you every minute.</span> <span id="s210">Are you going to jump the train or not?"</span> <span id="s211">He said, “Don’t worry - I wouldn’t do that to you.</span> <span id="s212">Maybe to some of the other guys I would.</span> <span id="s213">The First Sergeant is one.</span> <span id="s214">But you don't have to worry."</span> <span id="s215">And I never had no trouble.</span> <span id="s216">We got overseas and he was the best soldier in the outfit.</span> <span id="s217">He would do anything and because he was Jewish, he was out [unintelligible].</span> <span id="s218">He said “I won't be satisfied until I see the German blood running down the hill."</span> <span id="s219">He ended up with the Distinguished Service Cross and would have probably gotten the Congressional Medal of Honor if he didn't have such a bad record in the States.</span> <span id="s220">I can verify that they were going to nominate him for the Congressional Medal of Honor, but they wouldn't because of his poor record in the States.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: Any particular incidents or just the fact that he had shaped up?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s223">One of the first [unintelligible] we were in, we stopped our half- tracks outside the town.</span> <span id="s224">Our company moved in to the town with no resistance.</span> <span id="s225">Once we got in there, the Germans were hiding in the cellars and everything.</span> <span id="s226">But they were [unintelligible] the middle of our men.</span> <span id="s227">Some of the men got cut off without ammunition.</span> <span id="s228">They radioed back to the company headquarters that they were out of ammunition and cut off.</span> <span id="s229">He took 30 caliber machine gun belts and hung them around his neck -- he had the weight of machine gun belts that a normal man couldn't carry -- crawled on his hands and knees through the sniper fire to get to this company and led them back out of there.</span> <span id="s230">And that wasn't the only thing he did.</span> <span id="s231">Anytime they wanted somebody to go out on a scouting mission or go out and bring back a German prisoner he’d volunteer for it and go out and do it.</span> <span id="s232">And finally, one time when we were going to take a town, he was out scouting in front of our lines and he got hit in the stomach.</span> <span id="s233">He stood.</span> <span id="s234">up and started shaking his fist at the Germans and shouting at them, calling them names and everything.</span> <span id="s235">We had medics that had to go out and pull him down and take him back.</span> <span id="s236">He lived but that was the last we saw of him.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: Do you know if he is alive today?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A, I don't know if he’s alive today.</span> <span id="s239">Nobody’s been able to find him, but he didn't get killed They know he survived.</span> <span id="s240">There were a number of other instances.</span> <span id="s241">One time he went out to get a German prisoner.</span> <span id="s242">They told him not to bring back a prisoner.</span> <span id="s243">They wanted to find out what was in the town that we were going in to and he came back and he didn't have a prisoner.</span> <span id="s244">He said, "I had one.</span> <span id="s245">But I was marching him back and I forgot to take his gun away and I turned around and he shot me.</span> <span id="s246">The bullet went in to his gun stock so he said he had to shoot him.</span> <span id="s247">There’s quite a story in that book [unintelligible].</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: Thank you very much.</span></p></body></html>
