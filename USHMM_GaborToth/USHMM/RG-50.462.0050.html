the town itself, approximately what was the population GT: The population was approximately nine to ten thousand people.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">EM: And of these about 500 Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">GT: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">EM: Do you come from an Orthodox home?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">GT: No, not at all.</span> <span id="s36">My father believed very little,

Did you have brothers or sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">GT: We were three brothers and we were three sisters and like I said I was the youngest.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">EM: What was the occupation of your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">GT: My father was a tinsmith, but he had a big shop and he was working mostly for the government, for the state, for the city.</span> <span id="s42">He was a very intelligent man and he was an artist in his field.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">EM: So you would say that it was a middle class family?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">GT: Yes, we were a middle class family.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">EM: Tell me, did you go to public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">GT: No, I never went to public school.</span> <span id="s47">I went to the Jewish school which was…</span></p> <p><span id="s48">EM: Private?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">GT: It wasn’t a private school, but in this little town every denomination had a school of their own and they were subsidized from the state.</span> <span id="s50">But in this Jewish school, from where I came there were lots of Germans living around which came five-six hundred years back from Germany…</span></p> <p><span id="s51">EM: And not Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">GT: Not Jews, Germans and they settled down so the people spoke German there and especially the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">EM: So in the Jewish school what language was spoken, German?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">GT: The main language was German and of course Slovak because it was already Czechoslovakia and we learned Hebrew, which was an elementary school.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">EM: And then you went to …?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">GT: Then after four years I went to the German Gymnasium.</span> <span id="s57">This was Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s58">It was very democratic and every minority had so much and so much schools according to population of the minority.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">EM: Now, the town of Levoèa was in Slovakia?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">GT: It was in Slovakia.</span> <span id="s61">It was called Sipsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">EM: How do you spell it?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">GT: S-I-P-S-E-N.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">EM: The area was called Sipsen?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">GT: Yes, Sipsen, it was like a Gau, a county, and Levoèa was the capital of this county and there was lots of schools there.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">EM: Now, did you experience much antisemitism when you were growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">GT: It was, it was antisemitism.</span> <span id="s68">The Slovaks, which was really the natives of the county, of the land, they were very antisemitic and the Germans naturally too and we always felt you are a Jew and usually the Jews went with the Jews and the Gentiles with the Gentiles, but they were pretty good with each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">EM: Did you have any close friends that were non-Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">GT: Not that I can say.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">EM: How about the Zionist movement?</span></p> <p><span

Instructed?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">GT: Instructed in Jewish history.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">EM: So you were active... how about your sisters and brothers?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">GT: We were all in this Zionist organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">EM: How about your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">GT: My parents were good Jews, but they did not belong to the organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">EM: Did you keep a Kosher house?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">GT: Yes, definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">EM: And you attended the synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">GT: Only on High Holy days.</span> <span id="s86">My father went every Saturday to the Temple and my mother … it was not a style by us for women to go to the synagogue</span></p> <p><span id="s87">EM: But your father went?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">GT: My father went because we had lots of friends and all the news we got from there.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">EM: Now, could you tell me what you recall of the time when the war started?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">GT: It was a very traumatic time.</span> <span id="s91">My father couldn’t understand it at all.</span> <span id="s92">He lost his friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">EM: When did the Germans come in to …?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">GT: The Germans really did not come in to Slovakia because the Germans took Bohemia in ’39 and the Slovaks were big nationalists.</span> <span id="s95">The Slovak nationalists had a leader.</span> <span id="s96">He was a priest.</span> <span id="s97">His name was Hlinka and they became Hlinkists, the same as the German nationalists they became Slovak nationalists.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">EM: They were Fascists.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">GT: They were Fascists and they became independent in 1939.</span> <span id="s100">They became augeschlossen.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">EM: Allied…</span></p> <p><span id="s102">GT: Yes, allied with the Germans, Hungarians, Italians and Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">EM: The Axis.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">GT: The Axis, exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">EM: So did things change?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">GT: Things changed very much.</span> <span id="s107">The Jews couldn’t go to school anymore.</span> <span id="s108">They couldn’t finish the school anymore and we couldn’t go anymore at certain times, in the city, in the town.</span> <span id="s109">We had certain hours when we could shop and slowly but surely we lost, say, acquaintances with the Gentiles.</span> <span id="s110">My father had a friend a Gentile, a very good friend, and he was really a Communist and when it started, the nationalistic era, he became a Nazi and this was the biggest surprise of my father and a … very painful surprise.</span> <span id="s111">That a man, he was a very smart man, this friend, and a rich man.</span> <span id="s112">He was a painter, very successful, and when he became a Nazi my father couldn’t understand.</span> <span id="s113">And he knew everybody in the town, you know, [unclear] and he was everywhere, he was in the city, in the City Council.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">EM: Big shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">GT: Yes, he was in the Trade Union, he was in the Jewish Community, he was all over.</span> <span id="s116">My father was very well known.</span> <span id="s117">He was a very decent man.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">EM: Your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">GT: Yes, my father, was a very decent man and everyone knew of him and then at once he had no friends anymore.</span> <span id="s120">Nobody stopped him and said hello Mr. Braun or shook his hand, which was what he was accustomed to.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">EM: Did he continue with his work?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">GT: We continued till 1940 and because he was so well known, the state took him over.</span> <span id="s123">He was then employed by the state and he then made work for the state with my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">EM: Now, did the Jews have to move into a special area, a ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">GT: No, not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">EM: And could the children still go to school like before?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">GT: Yea, but only in the elementary school, in the Jewish school and there was one teacher there.</span> <span id="s128">I really don’t know anymore very clear how it happened or what happened in the last years of ’41 and ’42.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">EM: So life was going on more or less normal except for more restrictions?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">GT: A lot of restrictions and then …</span></p> <p><span id="s131">EM: How about food?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">GT: Food was very difficult to get, very difficult to get.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">EM: Were there ration cards or were there …?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">GT: No, there wasn’t ration cards, but because we were Jews, you know, when we came in to the stores we couldn’t get it anymore and there was no money either because there was no work and no money.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">EM: But the government did not confiscate any stores or Jewish businesses?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">GT: Oh, yes, they confiscated, I think, in 1940 and ’41, they confiscated all the Jewish stores.</span> <span id="s137">All Jews who were independent, they were confiscated, they were arisiert [aryanized].</span> <span id="s138">We were not because my father was employed, like I said, by the state in the last year.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">EM: This was going on till when?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">GT: Till 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">EM: And then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">GT: And then it so happened that Germany, the President of Slovakia was a priest, Kitso [Tiso], and Germany asked from Kitso [Tiso] that he should send thousand people to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s143">This started …</span></p> <p><span id="s144">EM: To alarm the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">GT: Yea, to send the Jews, they started … I think they wanted to know what the world would say to that.</span> <span id="s146">So we were rounded up, thousand girls, not only from Levoèa, in Levoèa there were no thousand girls – but a thousand girls from the surrounding … there was a … from 14 years to 40 years, unmarried girls were rounded up and I was too, I was rounded up too and they came for me on the 21st of March.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">EM: Of 19.</span> <span id="s148">.</span> <span id="s149">?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">GT: Of 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">EM: What happened to your brothers?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">GT: Two brothers were in Bucharest and they were Slovakian citizens in Romania so they were okay, for the time being.</span> <span id="s153">My two sisters were married so for the time being they too were left alone, not my oldest sister.</span> <span id="s154">I was the first one to go away from home and then my oldest sister’s husband went.</span> <span id="s155">They took him because someone was missing from the …</span></p> <p><span id="s156">EM: The work …?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">GT: Not from the work, but from the contingent.</span> <span id="s158">They had to deliver from the town where he was and somebody was missing so they took him too and he shouldn’t have gone because he had two children and a wife, but they took him.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">EM: So you went on the transport?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">GT: First, they took us from Levoèa to Poprad.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">EM: To where?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">GT: To Poprad, it was another town.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">EM: Would you spell it, please?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">GT: P-O-P-R-A-D – this was the Sammelplatz.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">EM: The gathering…</span></p> <p><span id="s166">GT: The gathering, yea, and they gathered us there from all over the small towns, religious, everybody who was from 14 to 40 who wasn’t married and it was a horrible feeling.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">EM: Did you have any idea where you were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">GT: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">EM: Or what was really happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">GT: They told us that we will go to work for a time.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">EM: And they didn’t say where?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">GT: They didn’t say where … to Poland.</span> <span id="s173">They said we will go to Poland and we will work there.</span> <span id="s174">It was such a horrible feeling, we were concentrated in my town in the German Gymnasium where I went to school.</span> <span id="s175">Then they took us with all the packages we were carrying and they took us to the railroad station and all the Gentiles was standing, you know, on both sides of the highway because we took the highway down and it was a horrible feeling.</span> <span id="s176">We felt like a pariah, absolute without thought we couldn’t even think what was happening to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">EM: What was the attitude of the non-Jews when they saw you being rounded up?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">GT: Some people, most people they didn’t care, absolutely not.</span> <span id="s179">The Germans, the minority of Germans and the minority of Hungarians they couldn’t care less.</span> <span id="s180">There was a few people that were sympathetic.</span> <span id="s181">Those few people who … when I went away it was a very new experience for everybody and they didn’t sort it out, the people, what is happening because the Jews themselves didn’t know because they couldn’t image in their wildest dreams that something like that could happen in 1942 in the middle of Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">EM: So you were taken to Poprad and from there?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">GT: From Poprad, my brother came through to visit me the next day because he was still free and he came to visit me.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">EM: They didn’t take young men, just women?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">GT: No, first they took only women and he came to visit me and … he gave me advise, never volunteer, he said.</span> <span id="s186">You know, he was in the army and he said never volunteer just do what you have to.</span> <span id="s187">It was very, very sad.</span> <span id="s188">There was other men who came to visit the brides, the girlfriends, you know, and there was a Stacheldraht [barbed wire] that divided us and it was …</span></p> <p><span id="s189">EM: Barbed wire.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">GT: Barbed wire, yea, it was a very sad and frightening thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">EM: How long did you stay in Poprad?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">GT: Only two days.</span> <span id="s193">The 23rd they put us in freight cars.</span> <span id="s194">I don’t know how many they put us in.</span> <span id="s195">I don’t remember anymore, 40 or 50.</span> <span id="s196">We were like sardines and there was nothing where to sit, where to lay down.</span> <span id="s197">It was closed and it was like animals they took in this car, a transport like animals.</span> <span id="s198">There was a little window on the top … with .</span> <span id="s199">.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">EM: With wire.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">GT: With wire.</span> <span id="s202">There was no air, it was frightening, there was no toilets there.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">EM: How about water?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">GT: Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">EM: How long were you in the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">GT: I really could not… We went the whole day and the whole night and the next day morning we came to Auschwitz and they stopped the train outside of Auschwitz and they said … and they opened the car and they said everybody out and we had to jump, maybe six feet, you know, high but we were very young and in good conditions.</span> <span id="s207">Everybody jumped out and they said leave... we didn’t know where we are.</span> <span id="s208">It was an unbelievable place for us and we had not the faintest idea where we were and what is awaiting of us and the SS … it was all over the SS and we saw a few people in stripes below us, but we didn’t even think of it that something … going in a prison and of course, we were terribly tired and frightened and these feelings of despair, you know, but nobody wanted to believe that something … nobody could imagine what will happen to us.</span> <span id="s209">And they said we should leave the valises there and we should just go and so we went and we came to a door where it was written Arbeit macht frei and we went in and we were standing there … they took us to a barrack and they said we should get undressed … no, no, we were standing there and they said we should wait, but then there came German women in striped clothes, not Jewish, and they told us … they came an hour before us …so they brought these German women because they didn’t know what will happen to us… the Germans didn’t know, the SS didn’t know what will happen, how it will develop the whole thing so these German women they brought them to tell us how to work, what to do, how to behave.</span> <span id="s210">These were women who were prisoners for political reason or they were thieves taken out from prisons or they were street girls who didn’t want to work.</span> <span id="s211">They called them asocial.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">EM: Asocial.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">GT: Asocial, yes.</span> <span id="s214">And so we were waiting there in line and then they took us in, ten by ten, I don’t remember anymore how many they took in at once and they cut our hair.</span> <span id="s215">I think this was a … Waschküche, how do you say it?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">EM: A laundry?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">GT: A laundry, yea, and there were big tubs and my number is also 1,337 so I was 337th that went in and I saw how they put these girls in these tubs and this hot water, it was terrible and then they came out… I never spoke about this because this was so horrible, horrible to see it.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">EM: It wasn’t a shower?</span> <span id="s219">You had to go into the tub to wash?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">GT: We had to get undressed and was like Entlausung</span></p> <p><span id="s221">EM: Disinfection.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">GT: Disinfection, yes, and they were dressed in military clothes that belonged to the Russians that was killed before us, no buttons, no belts, no nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">EM: So when you came out of the tub you had to …</span></p> <p><span id="s224">GT: But first they cut your hair and this was to me the most horrible experience, my legs jumped up and down and the girl who cut my hair, she was a German, she said be careful they shouldn’t see because they will think you have some sickness and something awful can happen to you and I didn’t know what she meant.</span> <span id="s225">Only later on, you know, I remembered what she said to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">EM: So you were trembling?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">GT: I was trembling, my feet went up five, six inches, shaking.</span> <span id="s228">I didn’t even know it, but what I saw had such a horrible impression on me, I was absolutely without any thoughts, without any feeling, I mean conscious feelings.</span> <span id="s229">And then there was a doctor who examined us, how shall I say that?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">EM: Was he a German or was he Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">GT: A German captain, I forgot his name, but he was examining us like a female examination.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">EM: A gynecological … ?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">GT: A gynecologist and 80% of these women were virgins.</span> <span id="s234">It was most, what shall I say, it took away all the humanity from us.</span> <span id="s235">We felt like dirt.</span> <span id="s236">We felt like just a piece of meat, you know.</span> <span id="s237">It was horrible because, like I said, 80% was all … virgins and I never heard of a gynecologist, but nobody went through something like that, and it shook us to the bone, it shook us to our souls.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">EM: How was the examination done … privately?</span></p> <p><span id="s239">GT: No, no, it wasn’t privately.</span> <span id="s240">This was even more terrible .</span> <span id="s241">.</span> <span id="s242">it was open so everybody could see it and everybody went through.</span> <span id="s243">The first thousand went through.</span> <span id="s244">After that …</span></p> <p><span id="s245">EM: And it was one doctor?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">GT: One doctor.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">EM: You don’t remember his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">GT: No, I don’t remember his name.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">EM: Was he in uniform?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">GT: SS uniform, he was.</span> <span id="s251">He didn’t even have a white coat on, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">EM: What was the excuse, what did he say, why was he …?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">GT: If we didn’t have stashed away gold or diamonds or something like that.</span> <span id="s254">Just to make us lose our … how should I say this …</span></p> <p><span id="s255">EM: Dignity.</span> <span id="s256">Well, you know if he really was a doctor?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">GT: I don’t know, but as a doctor he was a long time there.</span> <span id="s258">He was a doctor.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">EM: Where did you go from there?</span> <span id="s260">What happened next?</span> <span id="s261">After the examination …</span></p> <p><span id="s262">GT: After the examination they gave us the uniform.</span> <span id="s263">We put it on.</span> <span id="s264">They gave us wooden shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">EM: When did you have that disinfection bath, before the examination or after?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">GT: I think before.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">EM: Before that…</span></p> <p><span id="s268">GT: No, after the bath was the examination, after the bath and then they gave us the uniform.</span> <span id="s269">They gave us one towel, I think and we put it on the head because I remember it was March and it was still cold and we had shaven heads and they gave us stockings, gray rough stockings with no hole that fit nothing and wooden shoes … Tape one, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s270">EM: So you were staying outside?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">GT: Yes, it was horrible, we didn’t get anything from our own clothes back.</span> <span id="s272">We just got this uniform, like I said, no buttons, no girdles, no belts, anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">EM: So how did the stockings hold up?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">GT: They didn’t, they didn’t, and the pants we had to hold … it was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s275">It was such an eerie feeling.</span> <span id="s276">We didn’t recognize each other without hair, without clothes, because it was horrible.</span> <span id="s277">But we went through these phases, I think, automatically.</span> <span id="s278">We weren’t capable of thinking.</span> <span id="s279">And then they lined us up and they took us .</span> <span id="s280">.</span> <span id="s281">there was ten barracks, ten houses, they called it barracks, blocks they called it and so they took us to the first block because there was nobody there.</span> <span id="s282">We were the first Jewish transport there.</span> <span id="s283">There was men there in the men Lager, but we were separate, the ten blocks were separate, and they took us in the first block, a thousand of us and there we were.</span> <span id="s284">Then it was already night and there was straw on the floor and we were so tired that everybody just …</span></p> <p><span id="s285">EM: Collapsed?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">GT: Collapsed.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">EM: Did you get any food on the first day, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">GT: I don’t remember anymore.</span> <span id="s289">I really don’t remember.</span> <span id="s290">I think there was some tea.</span> <span id="s291">[unclear]</span></p> <p><span id="s292">EM: So after the first night you stayed in the barracks, slept on the straw …</span></p> <p><span id="s293">GT: They woke us up early in the morning, maybe 5 o’clock in the morning and we had to go in the yard and stand up for Appel, and they were counting us, stood two, three hours and then they looked for workers and the Germans was the kapos and so they took us to work outside and there was a Polish-German war and all the houses …</span></p> <p><span id="s294">EM: A Polish-German what .</span> <span id="s295">.</span> <span id="s296">?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">GT: War, the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">EM: The war .</span> <span id="s299">.</span> <span id="s300">?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">GT: Yea, and the houses was all bombarded.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">EM: Oh, oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">GT: So they put us there to take apart the bricks, the traverses, the iron traverses and they showed us how … and the dogs … the SS with the dogs, was around us … and we worked there, but the second or third day we thought that was that, you know, the thousand of us, but the third day the other transports came and then they was asking who speaks German and who can register these newcomers, so I went to … they took me too and I was registering the newcomers and we went on and on and then it was a lull, they didn’t come.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">EM: Do you remember where these transports came from?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">GT: All over Slovakia, only from Slovakia, so the ten blocks was very quick filled up with Slovakian girls.</span> <span id="s306">Later on they brought over not only girls but they brought wives.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">EM: Women.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">GT: Who didn’t have children and maybe of the six weeks we was there, in between when it was allowed I went to work outside in the fields and I too worked with the bricks and the traverses and so forth and when we had to come home they told us to take our shoes off and we had to come back barefoot we had to come home with stones and in the fields where there was this staple [stubble].</span> <span id="s309">You cut your feet – we weren’t used to go barefoot.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">EM: Why did they make you go...?</span></p> <p><span id="s311">GT Just because they wanted to.</span> <span id="s312">They wanted to inhumanize … they wanted to take everything away from us, every human feeling, every dignity, every pride, everything.</span> <span id="s313">They wanted to... we were worse than a cockroach, [and more worth] the worse than we had and then we came once home from the fields there was a man standing there with two big dogs.</span> <span id="s314">We recognized him.</span> <span id="s315">This man was from our home town, who was a Hungarian before but became an SS.</span> <span id="s316">This was the thing to do.</span> <span id="s317">He was a Gentile and he recognized us and later when we came home we heard that he told the Jews that were still there that he saw us.</span> <span id="s318">It was a horrible, horrible time and many people died already in the first days.</span> <span id="s319">Once there was a horrible picture, one girl … we were surrounded with Stacheldraht.</span> <span id="s320">[barbed wire]</span></p> <p><span id="s321">EM: Barbed wire.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">GT: Barbed wire and one girl was so distraught that she went on the wire and it was …</span></p> <p><span id="s323">EM: Electric.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">GT: Electric wire and she was hanging there, nobody came to take... she wasn’t dead.</span> <span id="s325">She was yelling for help and they didn’t allow us to help her and nobody went to help her and she was hanging there for hours till she finally died and this was … such a horrible experience, but of all the horrible experiences we went through this was unbelievable that this could have happened.</span> <span id="s326">And so it went, like I said, six weeks, seven weeks after we came there.</span> <span id="s327">They brought mothers and small children to the camp and they put them in a separate block and nobody really saw them and nobody knew who they were or from where they came and after a long, long time, after months I heard... my sister came...</span></p> <p><span id="s328">EM: We are interrupting for a little while.</span> <span id="s329">Mrs. Truly is overcome by emotion.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">GT: My sister was married in the [unclear] in Dolny Kubin, it was a county.</span> <span id="s331">She came, she was 32 years old.</span> <span id="s332">She came with a four and a half year old son.</span> <span id="s333">I didn’t know that she came because I thought they were safe where they lived.</span> <span id="s334">They were rich and they had good connections so I never thought it would happen to her, but she was there and they were holding them for two, three weeks because they didn’t know what to do with them so … of course, I knew this only later on – they telegraphed to Berlin and till the answer came they were holding these people and finally the answer came they should gas them.</span> <span id="s335">This was the first gassing in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s336">They gassed the mothers with small children.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">EM: Did you know at that time that your sister was in that transport?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">GT: No, no I did not know.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">EM: So you learned later?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">GT: Much later because it was allowed … once we wrote home, once and I wrote to my parents .</span> <span id="s341">.</span> <span id="s342">we had a code, everybody had a .</span> <span id="s343">.</span> <span id="s344">code how to write home to let them know what was going on and I wrote to them that they should never come where I am.</span> <span id="s345">If they have to come they should rather go to Aunt Hani who was dead already so they understood what I meant.</span> <span id="s346">But my sister was married to a very nice rich Jewish man and he had family and he could have stayed still because he had a permit to stay, for some reason or other, but they came for his parents and his brother and he was attached to his parents, like normally every child is, so he wanted to go with his parents and his brother too, and so they went and so they lost their lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">EM: Were you still working and registering?</span></p> <p><span id="s348">GT: No, I was not registering anymore.</span> <span id="s349">I was working outside and it was a horrible, horrible work because first of all, you had to have a pair of shoes.</span> <span id="s350">If you didn’t have a pair of shoes you was dead already.</span> <span id="s351">It was only a matter of days that you died.</span> <span id="s352">Shoes was the most important thing in Auschwitz and I saw that this work outside was horrible and I will not survive if I work outside, if I do the Aussenarbeit [outside work] too long and I tried and I succeeded to come in the camp in the Washküche which means laundry, where they cleaned the clothes of the SS, no, not the SS, from the Heftlinge [prisoners] who died or were murdered, really, we was cleaning these clothes full of lice, you know, but I knew I had to come somewhere inside to work otherwise I will not survive.</span> <span id="s353">So I came there, somehow they took me.</span> <span id="s354">A German was there, a kapo, a German Heftling, a prisoner.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">EM: A woman?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">GT: A woman, only women, there was no men in the whole camp in the .</span> <span id="s357">.</span> <span id="s358">women’s camp and I brought brought my girlfriend there.</span> <span id="s359">She was a professor, she had a Ph.D. and she wouldn’t have survived work outside either so I asked the kapo if she would take her and she was very impressed that she has a Ph.D. so she took her.</span> <span id="s360">And I had two cousins there, young cousins …</span></p> <p><span id="s361">EM: Do you remember the name of this friend?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">GT: Yes, Julia Ferdi.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">EM: Did she survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">GT: She survived, yes, but she committed suicide .</span> <span id="s365">.</span> <span id="s366">ten, fifteen years after she came out.</span> <span id="s367">She was physically and mentally …</span></p> <p><span id="s368">EM: Broken?</span></p> <p><span id="s369">GT: Broken.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">EM: Let’s go back to .</span> <span id="s371">.</span> <span id="s372">you were working in the laundry …</span></p> <p><span id="s373">GT: Yea, and I brought my two cousins in .</span> <span id="s374">.</span> <span id="s375">I mean, I wasn’t such a big shot, I was just a worker like everybody else there, but somehow I said they are strong girls, young strong girls, so she took them in.</span> <span id="s376">They was maybe 16 or 17 years old and they worked maybe two or three days there and then they went out.</span> <span id="s377">They said they don’t want to work here.</span> <span id="s378">They said this is very bad air and they want to be with their friends.</span> <span id="s379">I did my utmost to bring them in.</span> <span id="s380">I couldn’t help them anymore because you were so busy with yourself to stay alive that you didn’t had .</span> <span id="s381">.</span> <span id="s382">not the time but .</span> <span id="s383">.</span> <span id="s384">you just was busy with yourself .</span> <span id="s385">.</span> <span id="s386">self-preservation was so strong in you and you really had to watch every minute to stay alive.</span> <span id="s387">I lost them, these girls, they didn’t come to see me because they were working outside and they got always weaker and weaker and once I heard they brought the younger one from work dead into the camp and the other one .</span> <span id="s388">.</span> <span id="s389">came to visit me and she said I don’t want to live anymore.</span> <span id="s390">My parents… they brought the parents in and with the youngest sister they went straight in the gas, and Evy died, she said, I don’t want to live anymore and she disappeared and [unclear] I said don’t do this, watch yourself and be strong and try to live, but she didn’t She disappeared too and that was all that I heard from the nearer family, otherwise, I was all by myself.</span> <span id="s391">Somehow I was glad I was by myself because if I had to watch over somebody else it was true to say it was a horrible burden, you know, because you were so busy with yourself to stay alive that I felt I was happy that I was alone.</span> <span id="s392">I was praying not because I didn’t want to have somebody, I didn’t want anybody should come from the family because I didn’t want they should go through what I’m going through and because it was impossible to watch somebody else.</span> <span id="s393">There was no chance because you had to watch yourself.</span> <span id="s394">You couldn’t look at anybody else.</span> <span id="s395">I don’t know if somebody can understand this, but it was a life without hope, without reason, without future, but everybody wanted to live.</span> <span id="s396">That was the last that dies in a person, the self-preservation.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">EM: Because many people say that what helped them to survive is the close bond that they had with somebody and worrying and doing .</span> <span id="s398">.</span> <span id="s399">and they had to live for somebody else to pull them through and that gave them the incentive to fight back.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">GT: It depends where you were.</span> <span id="s401">If you were in an office, if you were working in an office, life was easier, you know, but if you were working in the fields it was much more difficult.</span> <span id="s402">In an office you had an opportunity to wash yourself, to go in a … toilet, to close the door, to steal some food from somewhere or you looked for some connections, you know, somebody was working in the kitchen and you had a friend there so she gave you here and there a potato, something.</span> <span id="s403">But if you was working outside you had no opportunity whatsoever so life was one hundred percent harder to work outside than somewhere to work inside.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">EM: So tell me, how long did you work in the laundromat [laundry]?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">GT: In the laundromat [laundry] I was working till I went from Auschwitz to Birkenau.</span> <span id="s406">Then we went to Birkenau because the camp was too small for the people who came in a rapid succession every day, every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">EM: That was in 1942?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">GT: In ’42, March, April, May, June, July and there was, of course, regular gassing of people and still only from Slovakia and so they opened Birkenau.</span> <span id="s409">Birkenau was an absolute desolate place with huts, big huts, put together from stone and mortar, nothing else and a roof, which was leaking always and it wasn’t like earth it was clay.</span> <span id="s410">It was light brown and it was very difficult when it was raining.</span> <span id="s411">You sunk in there.</span> <span id="s412">And who didn’t have the strength to pull yourself up died in this mud and there was nobody .</span> <span id="s413">.</span> <span id="s414">after a while you were staying there.</span> <span id="s415">.</span> <span id="s416">I was working outside and there was always malaria .</span> <span id="s417">.</span> <span id="s418">There was no water there and the food, you can’t speak about the food …</span></p> <p><span id="s419">EM: How come they transferred you to Birkenau?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">GT: Everybody was transferred, only the people .</span> <span id="s421">.</span> <span id="s422">everybody was transferred, but in the first week they took out the girls which was in the office or which was in the Nahstube [sewing room] you know .</span> <span id="s423">.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">EM: The sewing room.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">GT: The sewing, ya, because the SS didn’t want to be with the people from Birkenau because there was lice there, there was mosquitoes, there was diarrhea, there was typhus, you know, so they took these people in the beginning they know what it was there, you know.</span> <span id="s426">The killed 30,000 Russians before we came there so they know the place so they took these girls out and they took them in the Staatsgebäude [administration building].</span> <span id="s427">.</span> <span id="s428">this was like...</span></p> <p><span id="s429">EM: Which girls?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">GT: From the office that worked in some other capacity for the SS, so they took them in a building which once must have been a municipal building but they made it over into a barrack for SS women and these girls lived in a basement which was… they had beds.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">EM: The Jewish girls?</span></p> <p><span id="s432">GT: The Jewish girls, they had beds, and there was a toilet and there was a shower there so we can’t compare this life with the life of the people that lived in Birkenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">EM: But you said you were transferred to Birkenau?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">GT: I went to Birkenau</span></p> <p><span id="s435">EM: And then you came back?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">GT: I didn’t come back, I stayed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">EM: Oh, I thought you went .</span> <span id="s438">.</span> <span id="s439">you stayed .</span> <span id="s440">.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">GT: Many of my friends went because there was a girl from my home town who was a very big shot there, who was a Friseuse [hairdresser] you know.</span> <span id="s442">She was very street-wise and she brought all her family in.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">EM: To where?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">GT: To Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s445">She asked .</span> <span id="s446">.</span> <span id="s447">she was making the hair of the … Commandant’s wife and for the SS women and she had that rapport with them.</span> <span id="s448">She knew how to speak with them She wasn’t smart at all, but street-wise and her parents and my parents was very good friends and the grandparents and great-grandparents and she was a friend of my sister and she took a lot of girls in.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">EM: To the .</span> <span id="s450">.</span> <span id="s451">?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">GT: To the Staatsgebäude from Birkenau and I was still in Birkenau and then I got very sick.</span> <span id="s453">I got typhus and I had the diarrhea and all the friends I had, one was in Auschwitz and two was in Birkenau, they were for themselves, you know.</span> <span id="s454">They found .</span> <span id="s455">.</span> <span id="s456">every one was look for a niche.</span> <span id="s457">One good friend I had, she went with another girl, she was a kapo, so she was Blockälteste [block elder] and she was like her girlfriend, you know, so when I was so very, very sick I went to her and I said I just want to have warm water.</span> <span id="s458">She was a very poor girl.</span> <span id="s459">Interestingly, the poor kids which were from poor home they found their way much easier in this Lager than us.</span> <span id="s460">They knew from home how to fight for life, for survival, and she was a very poor girls home, but in the last years we were friends, but when we came to Auschwitz she just left us all and she looked for a better place for herself.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">EM: And she became a .</span> <span id="s462">.</span> <span id="s463">?</span></p> <p><span id="s464">GT: And she became a friend of the Blockälteste .</span> <span id="s465">.</span> <span id="s466">she had a block.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">EM: The Blockälteste was Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s468">GT: The block .</span> <span id="s469">.</span> <span id="s470">was Jewish too, everybody was Jewish.</span> <span id="s471">And when the food came she gave the food out and everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">EM: And this was in Birkenau?</span></p> <p><span id="s473">GT: This was in Birkenau.</span> <span id="s474">It was already in Auschwitz that it started and in Birkenau it was even worse, the conditions .</span> <span id="s475">.</span> <span id="s476">you can say it was one hundred percent worse than in Auschwitz and in Auschwitz it was bad, really bad and I got typhus and diarrhea and I had from my nutrition I had on my foot an Ausschlag.</span> <span id="s477">[rash, eczema] EM: Eczema?</span></p> <p><span id="s478">GT: Eczema, but I didn’t have time to look at what is happening because I had pants on.</span> <span id="s479">In between it got winter and somebody somehow I came … gave me .</span> <span id="s480">.</span> <span id="s481">I got that pair of pants.</span> <span id="s482">I wore those pants and I didn’t have the time to take off the pants because we were staying Appel four or five hours in the evening, in the morning we were standing three, four hours from three o’clock, 4 o’clock in the morning to seven o’clock.</span> <span id="s483">Seven o’clock in the morning we went to work and in between I got a better place to work, not in the fields, but I went with a column, we went to barracks where they had all the things that the Jews brought with them, you know, and we sorted them out and they were sent to Germany back.</span> <span id="s484">This was a good place to be because here and there you found a cookie, a piece of candy, a piece of chocolate, a piece of salami or a can of condensed milk so this was a better place to be, you know, but when I got so sick I couldn’t work anymore any foot was so swollen that I couldn’t even take my pants off, but finally somehow one day I went in a barrack where a friend of mine from that Zionist organization was, she was a nurse, in the Revier, a small hospital and I said .</span> <span id="s485">.</span> <span id="s486">she was an .</span> <span id="s487">.</span> <span id="s488">American-born girl, but she lived in .</span> <span id="s489">.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">EM: Slovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">GT: In Slovakia because the mother brought her back when she was a small girl, but, of course, it didn’t help her when they took her.</span> <span id="s492">When they took her they didn’t let her out anymore.</span> <span id="s493">So I knew her from the Zionist organization and I said Sylvia, I said, “I don’t know what happened to my foot, will you look at it?”</span> <span id="s494">I was afraid to go in the Revier this was .</span> <span id="s495">.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">EM: The Revier is the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">GT: It was already beginning ’43.</span> <span id="s498">So, somehow I took my pants off and she looked at my foot and it was absolutely red and swollen, double like it usually was.</span> <span id="s499">And she said, you know what, here is a doctor Pearl, she was a Jewish woman.</span> <span id="s500">She lived it through and I think she’s still alive, she’s in New York.</span> <span id="s501">She said I will bring you ichthiol and you put it on your foot and I bring you bandages too and you come in two or three days and we will see what’s happening.</span> <span id="s502">But in-between I got so big and so thin, I lost so much weight that I hardly could walk.</span> <span id="s503">So I somehow managed not to go in daytime to work, but I went in the night to work that they should not see me and after two or three days .</span> <span id="s504">.</span> <span id="s505">it was already November in ’42.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">EM: ’42 or ’43?</span></p> <p><span id="s507">GT: ’42 and it was icy and the highway was icy.</span> <span id="s508">We had to walk maybe two kilometers and I hardly could walk.</span> <span id="s509">I couldn’t breathe.</span> <span id="s510">I was so thin already and I fell and in the moment I fell I felt something busted in my foot and the foot somehow was better.</span> <span id="s511">I felt better.</span> <span id="s512">I couldn’t go up.</span> <span id="s513">I had a girlfriend, friend from home, I said, “Mimi, help me to go up” .</span> <span id="s514">.</span> <span id="s515">and she didn’t want to because she was afraid that she will stay behind and they will shot her or beat her, but somehow they picked me up and I went in the lager.</span> <span id="s516">Then I went to this girl again in the Revier, no, not in the Revier in the block and she said now it is better because the pus is going out, you know.</span> <span id="s517">And then it was… Tape two, side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s518">EM: Now, how long were you in Birkenau?</span> <span id="s519">You got better, the leg got better?</span></p> <p><span id="s520">GT: The leg got better, but it always renewed.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">EM: It came back?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">GT: It came back and it gave me trouble till it opened again, you know, and the pus always came out of this foot and I could hardly walk and then it was cold and we stayed on Appel for hours and hours and I was very weak already from the malaria and from the typhus and the diarrhea.</span> <span id="s523">I was just like a shadow of myself and my toes were frozen.</span> <span id="s524">One shoe was a 38 and the other was a 45 and I couldn’t go .</span> <span id="s525">.</span> <span id="s526">I wanted to go one evening to work again and there was a Blockältester, [block elder] a Jewish girl whom I knew and who knew my relatives and she pulled me out and she says to the officer, to the SS woman, she says, look this mussulman, she wants to go with the Rotköpfchen she wants to work in there (because the Rotkopfchen was one of the best columns).</span></p> <p><span id="s527">EM: That was the name of the column, Rotköpfchen?</span></p> <p><span id="s528">GT: And she said, such a mussulman and she wants to go and she pulled me out and I said to her in Slovak, I said, Elsa, you know who I am, look how I look.</span> <span id="s529">I can’t survive if you take me out and she didn’t care.</span> <span id="s530">She wanted to put somebody else, a better friend than I was, and the SS woman saw that I was talking to her and she slapped me and I was fleeing 20 feet and I was out of there.</span> <span id="s531">And the next morning a cousin of my sister-in-law came to me and she says take my cousin, who was my sister-in-law’s sister, take her with you and go in the … Pflanzenzucht.</span> <span id="s532">This girl, my sister-in-law’s cousin was a kapo in Aussendierst.</span> <span id="s533">She was working outside.</span> <span id="s534">She had a card for outside work and this cousin of hers which was my sister-in-law’s sister she said, “Go with Walli.”</span> <span id="s535">Walli was her name.</span> <span id="s536">“Go with Walli in the Pflanzenzucht.”</span></p> <p><span id="s537">EM: What was Pflanzenzucht?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">GT: It was another place to go which was not a bad place.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">EM: To work?</span></p> <p><span id="s540">GT: Ya, and we were so, both of us, we were such mussulmans.</span> <span id="s541">Pfalzenzucht was where they made experiments for vegetables, for flowers .</span> <span id="s542">.</span> <span id="s543">and so she said, “Go with her, go together because you are both looking so bad and I’m afraid to leave Walli in the lager, they will take her to the gas.”</span> <span id="s544">And so we went there together and we came somehow there and there was a girl whom I knew very well because when we came there we looked very much alike and they always mistook one for each other, for the other.</span> <span id="s545">She was from a small town too, no far from us, and she said “Ella, how do you look, I wouldn’t recognize you.”</span> <span id="s546">So I said to her … and she lived in this Staatsgebäude, [Administration building] this Eva, and I says to Eva, Gaban [Gabany] was her name, Eva Gabany, “Eva you should go back to the staatsgebaude and you’ll see Monsi.</span> <span id="s547">(This was the Friseuse´) and Lilly (who was a very good friend from home.)”</span> <span id="s548">I said, “Tell them if they don’t bring me in a few days into the Staatsgebaude then they shouldn’t bother anymore.</span> <span id="s549">I will be not alive.”</span> <span id="s550">And really, in a few days it came .</span> <span id="s551">.</span> <span id="s552">they was looking for me that I should go in the staatsgebaude.</span> <span id="s553">I was in a terrible condition.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">EM: So you were taken from Birkenau to Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">GT: Yes, from Birkenau to Auschwitz, but I had to go through the Entlausung.</span> <span id="s556">[delousing] You know, you went in the sauna.</span> <span id="s557">.</span> <span id="s558">I almost died there from the heat.</span> <span id="s559">I didn’t weigh more than maybe 30 pounds, 60 pounds, you know, I was just bones and I had all eczema on me and the foot … the pus was running out and there was a doctor, she was not even a doctor, but she acted as a doctor, a Jewish girl, I forgot her name, and she saw my number.</span> <span id="s560">All of us who went to Auschwitz, not only I went to Auschwitz, but other ones went through the staatsgebaude to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s561">There were many of us and there was a German girl too, Emy was her name, which I was very good with her.</span> <span id="s562">She was in the laundry, too.</span> <span id="s563">She was asocial, she was a street girl, so she came this doctor came with Mengele and Mengele looked at me and said, “She looks terrible this girl.”</span></p> <p><span id="s564">EM: The girl said that?</span></p> <p><span id="s565">GT: No, Mengele said, “This girl looks terrible.</span> <span id="s566">She goes to the staatsgebäude?</span> <span id="s567">So the doctor said, she saw my number.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">EM: The woman doctor?</span></p> <p><span id="s569">GT: Who was a Jewish girl, Ena, was her name.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">EM: And she was with .</span> <span id="s571">.</span> <span id="s572">?</span></p> <p><span id="s573">GT: She worked with the German doctor.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">EM: Even with Mengele?</span></p> <p><span id="s575">GT: Yea, with all of them, because she was considered as a doctor and she looked at me and she saw my number that I was the first and she says oh, she goes in the Staatsgebäude and they will give her better food, she will come to herself, and so I went.</span> <span id="s576">This was in February 1943, I, this Emy, this Gentile girl, German girl and I (she was not such a girl anymore she was in her forties) and two SS women and one SS man and a dog.</span> <span id="s577">And they took us, this was maybe 3 kilometers, Birkenau from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s578">On foot we went and I couldn’t walk because I couldn’t make the smallest hill and before it was raining.</span> <span id="s579">It was dry, the highway was dry, but there was a little water, you know .</span> <span id="s580">.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">EM: A puddle?</span></p> <p><span id="s582">GT: A puddle .</span> <span id="s583">.</span> <span id="s584">and I fell in the puddle and I couldn’t go up.</span> <span id="s585">I was so weak I couldn’t go up and the dog was jumping at me and the SS man was beating, was hitting me I should go up, I should go up.</span> <span id="s586">They would have killed me only the Commandant first was asking me.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">EM: Asking for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">GT: Asking for me because this girlfriend, Monsi, who was the Friseuse, she told the wife of the Commandant that she should ask for me because I am an expert in knitting and they had five children, so if the Commandant wouldn’t have asked for me they would have killed me on the spot.</span> <span id="s589">So I said, “I can’t go up,” I said, “it is no use.</span> <span id="s590">If you hit me or the dog jumps at me I just can’t go up.”</span> <span id="s591">I said, “Emy help me.”</span></p> <p><span id="s592">EM: Emy was the .</span> <span id="s593">.</span> <span id="s594">?</span></p> <p><span id="s595">GT: Emy was the Gentile girl and she put her arms to her hips and she said [unclear] “I, the Gentile, to help a Jewess?”</span> <span id="s596">And she didn’t.</span> <span id="s597">So, finally, I made it and we came to Staatsgebaude and it was already maybe six o’clock and everybody was already home from the offices and I who knew a lot of people, nobody recognized me.</span> <span id="s598">And then came from Monsi, the friseuse the sister, by name of Edna and she said, “Ella, for God’s sake, how you look!”</span> <span id="s599">And she brought me, I was sitting, and she brought me a cup of milk which I didn’t see since I went from home away and I was like an animal.</span> <span id="s600">I was drinking this milk like an animal and then the girls came.</span> <span id="s601">I was full of hair, you know, what they call the “Hungerhaare.”</span></p> <p><span id="s602">EM: What is that… hair of hunger?</span></p> <p><span id="s603">GT: Ya, ya.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">EM: Why, did more hair grow on you?</span></p> <p><span id="s605">GT: Yes, I was full of hair, I was and only the eyes I had, you know no hair on head.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">EM: You mean, hair grew on the face?</span></p> <p><span id="s607">GT: Yea, on the face.</span> <span id="s608">It was called the Hungerhaare.</span> <span id="s609">Such light hair, like fuzz.</span> <span id="s610">And my hair was cut, my hair was cut eleven times and everybody came, “Ella, how you look!”</span> <span id="s611">And Monsi came down, they told her I am here.</span> <span id="s612">She came down and she said, “I take you to the Revier.”</span> <span id="s613">She was so street-wise, she was so smart in this direction and she said I take you to the Revier because she saw I am not capable of anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">EM: The Revier was the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">GT: The hospital – there was a small hospital there and I had to take a bath and we went to the hospital and I was there four weeks without being able to budge – I was completely out of it and they brought me something… Monsi had access to a little food because she was with the SS so good so they gave her food and she brought me food and her sister and my girlfriend, a little bit, not much what I had, but I was there four weeks and then she came and one very significant thing happened.</span> <span id="s616">There was in the Revier a woman who was a Bibelforscher, something like a Jehovah Witness, and they were there because they were Jehovah Witnesses.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">EM: So, I want to come back to that point to the Jehovah Witnesses, were there many Jehovah Witnesses?</span></p> <p><span id="s618">GT: Quite a lot.</span> <span id="s619">They had always very good jobs, you know, because the only sin that they had was they were Jehovah Witnesses and they didn’t recognize people like that.</span> <span id="s620">So this woman was there…</span></p> <p><span id="s621">EM: She was in the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s622">GT: She was in the hospital with me and I was already maybe two or three weeks there, but I was really out of it and…</span></p> <p><span id="s623">EM: And this Jehovah Witness was also a patient?</span></p> <p><span id="s624">GT: A patient there.</span> <span id="s625">I was in the lowest courier and she was on the top.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">EM: In the bunks?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">GT: I was in the lowest bunk and she was on the third, the upper-most bunk and there was milk in the jar and the next morning it was missing from the jar, a little bit of milk from the jar was missing.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">EM: For whom was the milk?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">GT: I don’t know to whom it belonged, but it was there where this Bibelforscher was sleeping.</span> <span id="s630">In the morning they said, “who drank the milk?</span> <span id="s631">That was me,” they said, that I drank the milk because I was the hungriest there, you know, and I said, “How could I do this?</span> <span id="s632">I can’t even walk, how could I go up three bunks for the milk?”</span> <span id="s633">Everybody said yes I was the one and nobody spoke with me.</span> <span id="s634">I , of course, didn’t drink the milk because even if I would have wanted to I couldn’t have gone up because I didn’t have the strength and it mostly hurt me, but it was my friends that really believed I didn’t do it, you know.</span> <span id="s635">The third day this Bibelforscher which was decent people, her conscience bothered her and she said that she drank the milk and not I, but I was so insulted, I was so hurt that til now I can’t forget this.</span> <span id="s636">So I was there four weeks in the Revier then the Monsi came, the Friseuse, and said that the Aufscherin told her to take the Braun out because Mengele is coming tomorrow.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">EM: What do you mean the Braun?</span></p> <p><span id="s638">GT: Braun, my name.</span> <span id="s639">So she came and she said you have to go out.</span> <span id="s640">So I went out.</span> <span id="s641">I didn’t know from… my mind was really gone.</span> <span id="s642">Only faintly I oriented myself, but I went and I was sitting in the … she was so smart this girl, this Monsi, somebody else did my work, the knitting for the Commandant, and she said that I made it because she didn’t tell her that I’m so sick, you know.</span> <span id="s643">So after four weeks when I came out I did something, I don’t know, but slowly I got better and I did fantastic work and I don’t know even how I did it, how I could do this knitting for the Commandant.</span> <span id="s644">I made the most beautiful things and she was so happy with my work that sometimes she sent me an egg or a tomato or something.</span> <span id="s645">And then the Commandant Hoess…</span></p> <p><span id="s646">EM: And this was the wife of Hoess?</span></p> <p><span id="s647">GT: Ya, this was the wife of Hoess.</span> <span id="s648">And I was looking so bad and I was in the Nähstube.</span> <span id="s649">Then once the Aufscherin when I came out of the Revier and she said – Monsi, she says bring her for the Braun something – bring for the Braun every day food.</span> <span id="s650">I was so terribly looking that she couldn’t…</span></p> <p><span id="s651">EM: Couldn’t take it?</span></p> <p><span id="s652">GT: She couldn’t take it.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">EM: She was German?</span></p> <p><span id="s654">GT: She was a German SS woman and she was watching us, you know.</span> <span id="s655">So she said bring her.</span> <span id="s656">So she brought me every day in a milk can soup, but she gave to her sister, to her cousin, to her other cousin.</span> <span id="s657">Till it came to me I had maybe five spoons of soup and I so hungry I could have eaten the walls, and the ceilings and the can and everything.</span> <span id="s658">But slowly, slowly I came to myself, halfway.</span> <span id="s659">I couldn’t walk because my foot was still … the pus still came, and there came this doctor in this Revier, her name was Kosciuszko.</span> <span id="s660">Her great-great-grand uncle was Kosciuszko.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">EM: General Kosciuszko?</span></p> <p><span id="s662">GT: General Kosciuszko, who came as a solder in the American war, revolution, and she said – I have Knochentuberkulose.</span> <span id="s663">I have bone tuberculosis and I was, I knew that bone tuberculosis was contagious so I didn’t say to anybody what she said because I was afraid they would send me back to Birkenau if I have a contagious sickness and I really couldn’t walk.</span> <span id="s664">I couldn’t even go for my food, so once my girlfriend brought it.</span> <span id="s665">I had a cousin there so she said she should bring it to me, she didn’t want to bring it.</span> <span id="s666">Then Hoess was sent away…</span></p> <p><span id="s667">EM: So where were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s668">GT: I was in Staatsgebaude in the basement.</span> <span id="s669">The girls that worked for the SS men lived in the basement.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">EM: And that’s where?</span></p> <p><span id="s671">GT: I had to … [unclear] .</span> <span id="s672">.</span> <span id="s673">and first time when I came and I had to go to the toilet, so I went to the toilet and water was running.</span> <span id="s674">What I didn’t see water running for such a long time since I went away from home and I went to the toilet and I closed the door.</span> <span id="s675">I thought I’m in heaven.</span> <span id="s676">Nobody outside can understand what it is because we went to the latrine in wind, in snow, in storm.</span> <span id="s677">We had to go maybe fifty feet and sometimes we didn’t make it because we had diarrhea so it was to me, as if I have come to heaven.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">EM: The toilet?</span></p> <p><span id="s679">GT: Such luxury!</span> <span id="s680">And then in ’43 …</span></p> <p><span id="s681">EM: So you slept … then you went to the Nähstube?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">GT: No, the Nähstube was there on the same level in the basement, so I didn’t have to go very far and never went out so I couldn’t walk really, not very well, I walked very badly.</span> <span id="s683">I was so sick that my girlfriend, that Ph.D. girlfriend, when I first came out of the hospital, of the Revier, she made my bed for a whole month because I was unable to make it and so then the months went by.</span> <span id="s684">I wrote here and there to my family.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">EM: You could write, you were allowed?</span></p> <p><span id="s686">GT: Very seldom, but we could write.</span> <span id="s687">I really have a letter, a card still today from my, I wrote my brother to Bucharest and I wrote them they shouldn’t think of coming to me and they should wait for Eszo [?]</span> <span id="s688">who was the Russians, so they understood where I was and what life was there, if it was a life you can say so, and I was living for a whole year there and then Hoess was versetzt.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">EM: Transferred.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">GT: He was transferred to Poland to deeper in Poland to another Lager and I lost my job.</span> <span id="s691">I didn’t have for whom to knit anymore and so a girl said to me, you know, what you can come to the Verwaltung because there is a girl missing.</span> <span id="s692">They need a girl there.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">EM: In the administration …?</span></p> <p><span id="s694">GT: In the administration, the Verwaltung.</span> <span id="s695">And so I went there and I was working in the personnel and there I was till we went away from Auschwitz, the 18th of January.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">EM: What did you do in the personnel office?</span></p> <p><span id="s697">GT: Oh, I did the Kartothek – the SS man who came, who went for vacation who was transferred.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">EM: You mean the files …?</span></p> <p><span id="s699">GT: Yes, I was filing and there was a man, my boss was a man who was a lawyer from Romania.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">EM: A Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s701">GT: No, he was an SS man, but he made believe that he had nothing to do with Auschwitz, you know.</span> <span id="s702">He was very nice to me, I can say.</span> <span id="s703">I got a … across the street from the Verwaltung was a politische where Elsa was working [a cousin].</span> <span id="s704">Once they called me there and who came there hardly went out anymore.</span> <span id="s705">They beat them to death, you know, they beat them to a pulp.</span> <span id="s706">That was the rule and they called me there and they called other girls too and they told me that I got a permit to go to Israel, to Palestine, because I was in the Shomer Hatzair so somehow they had a list and everybody who was in the Shomer Hatzair they sent permits to go to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">EM: Who sent the permits?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">GT: Who was already in Israel, you know, who was already in Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">EM: Sent permits to Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s710">GT: They should let them go.</span> <span id="s711">They told the people who have permits that they will let us go.</span> <span id="s712">But of course it’s… [unclear]</span></p> <p><span id="s713">EM: That’s very interesting that these permits came to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">GT: And they called us.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">EM: What did they tell you?</span></p> <p><span id="s716">GT: They were asking me what I was, what I did, why they sent me.</span> <span id="s717">I said I don’t know who was sending me this I said I don’t know and I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s718">There was many of them because many girls was in Shomer.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">EM: But nothing happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s720">GT: Nothing happened, nobody could go out.</span> <span id="s721">Once was there nobody … the Jews, of course .</span> <span id="s722">.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">EM: What’s interesting is that the papers even came to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">GT: So my boss when I came back he was so relieved to see me back, you know, and so I was there till the 18th of January when we went to this march.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">EM: The death march.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">GT: The death march, we went for three days and three nights till we came to Loslau.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">EM: Loslau?</span> <span id="s728">How …?</span></p> <p><span id="s729">GT: I don’t know what the Polish name for it is, Loslau.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">EM: Not Breslau?</span></p> <p><span id="s731">GT: No, Loslau was German and lots of people died because who couldn’t walk they shot them, you know, and so every ten steps somebody was shot, you know, and there was a wind and a snow and there was English airplanes coming over us and they let down the .</span> <span id="s732">.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">EM: Bombs?</span></p> <p><span id="s734">GT: Not bombs, but the candles, you know, and I thought any minute they will come and save our lives.</span> <span id="s735">And I had a pair of boots, somebody gave me a pair of boots, [unclear] and it was a cut in the soles and the snow went under and we went from maybe four o‘clock in the afternoon until the next day, lunch time, next day twelve o’clock, one o’clock we walked and I could hardly walk anymore because I couldn’t walk good anyhow and this hurt me more and a girl near me, she was operated on appendix, and she had just little shoes on and she had a pair of boots in her hand which she was carrying and she said, “Who?”</span> <span id="s736">She was so weak she couldn’t.</span> <span id="s737">Everybody was throwing away everything, the bread, everything was ahead more than themselves and she said, “Who wants a pair of boots?”</span> <span id="s738">And I said, “Aniska, give me your boots.”</span> <span id="s739">I knew the girl and so she gave me the boots and I was carrying them through the whole night, through the day, till we came in a school and we stopped there and everybody fell asleep by the way and I tried to put off my shoes and put on the other boots, because I knew if I don’t change them that’s the end of me.</span> <span id="s740">And I changed the boots and so we made it to Loslau and in Loslau we was put in open wagons.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">EM: Cars?</span></p> <p><span id="s742">GT: Open trains where cows were or coals, where wood was transported and it was bitter cold because it was January, you know, because it was snowing .</span> <span id="s743">.</span> <span id="s744">and the bombardment .</span> <span id="s745">.</span> <span id="s746">and we were so pressed in together.</span> <span id="s747">So we came to Ravensbruck.</span> <span id="s748">Ravensbruck was overflown with people.</span> <span id="s749">And we got there one night, I think one night, and all our column went to another Lager outside of Ravensbruck where older people was there, which they was waiting they should die or they were gassed and there we stayed for a few days and then we went out from there …</span></p> <p><span id="s750">EM: Was it part of Ravensbruck?</span></p> <p><span id="s751">GT: Part of Ravensbruck, and I was, I knew that my mother was in Levoèa, that my brother took my mother from Seret to Levoèa because there was a revolution in Czechoslovakia in ’44, in October and he knew that, he took my mother… my father died in ’43 of cancer in Seret.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">EM: Where is Seret?</span></p> <p><span id="s753">GT: They went to Seret because my brother was a Inner Architect</span></p> <p><span id="s754">EM: Interior architect.</span> <span id="s755">And where is Seret, a town in Slovakia?</span></p> <p><span id="s756">GT: Slovakia, near Bratislava and my brother was, they was asking people who, like carpenters, because they made a factory of furniture and my brother saw because they took the boys already in between too, not only the girls, but they took the boys, they took families already, so my brother saw that here is no way out, he has to do something.</span> <span id="s757">So he went to Seret and he became the manager of this factory and he could take my parents with him.</span> <span id="s758">So my parents went there too and my father was the head of the tinsmith department.</span> <span id="s759">And, so they brought my sister who had the two children, they brought her in through protection, through connections, you know, they brought her in with the two children.</span> <span id="s760">So he took in October ’44 when the revolution, he took my mother home to, and she was hidden by a worker of ours, I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">EM: A non-Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s762">GT: A non-Jew and this I knew that she was there and I was happy she’s safe, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">EM: You knew that all the time or you knew that in Ravensbruck you learned?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">GT: No, I didn’t, I knew that in Auschwitz that she was hidden by this worker.</span> <span id="s765">And then when we went out of Ravensbruck in this old, in this Lager where the old people were, we stayed there two days.</span> <span id="s766">And then we went out again because we were so overcrowded that they took us out from this camp again and we didn’t know where we’re going, but we went.</span> <span id="s767">We had to go with the SS men and we went on this highway and there was this little embankment and there I recognized my mother .</span> <span id="s768">.</span> <span id="s769">[Mrs. Truly is weeping] She was so small …[weeping].</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Tape two, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s771">EM: Mrs. Braun is overcome by emotion.</span> <span id="s772">We are going to stop for a while.</span> <span id="s773">[Tape off, then on.]</span> <span id="s774">You were saying you walked near the embankment and you …</span></p> <p><span id="s775">GT: And my mother was standing with the other women – she was so small, she was only 62 years old [weeping] and we hugged each other, we kissed each other and then I had to go because the officer said Braun, Braun you have to go, and my mother wanted to give me her bread and I said, “No, no keep it you’ll need it,” and I had to go.</span> <span id="s776">[weeping]</span></p> <p><span id="s777">EM: Do you want to stop, Ella?</span></p> <p><span id="s778">GT: No.</span> <span id="s779">I had to leave her there and it is always on my conscience, but I had to leave her [weeping].</span> <span id="s780">I couldn’t do nothing else about it.</span> <span id="s781">And we went to Malchow with the train [unclear] and we went to Malchow.</span> <span id="s782">I couldn’t have taken her because they never would let her go.</span> <span id="s783">[crying]</span></p> <p><span id="s784">EM: [unclear]</span></p> <p><span id="s785">GT: Then we went to Malchow.</span> <span id="s786">We went on the train – on a personal train where you could sit down …</span></p> <p><span id="s787">EM: Passenger train.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">GT: Passenger train.</span> <span id="s789">And we went to Malchow…</span></p> <p><span id="s790">EM: From Ravensbruck to Malchow?</span></p> <p><span id="s791">GT: I don’t even know – two, three hours we went on the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">EM: So they were mostly young people that were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s793">GT: Yea, they came from Auschwitz, mostly girls from Staatsgebäude and, we were there, and it was absolutely a hunger Lager, there was nothing.</span> <span id="s794">.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">EM: Where?</span> <span id="s796">In Malchow?</span></p> <p><span id="s797">GT: In Malchow, nothing absolutely nothing, we got the food was water with grass in it.</span> <span id="s798">People died, they sat down and they couldn’t get up anymore.</span> <span id="s799">The food in Auschwitz was horrible.</span> <span id="s800">It wasn’t fit for a pig, it wasn’t fit for a human being, but somehow we survived and what we could steal here and there, a morsel here and a morsel there, a potato.</span> <span id="s801">And there we had nothing, but after a week a girl who was the Lageralteste she knew me and she liked me, so they were looking for thirty girls to go in the kitchen outside the Lager to clean the vegetables.</span> <span id="s802">I was one of the first she took and other thirty girls.</span> <span id="s803">So then, we stole there a lot, stole half of the vegetables what they gave us to clean.</span> <span id="s804">We stole and took it in the Lager.</span> <span id="s805">If they had catched us they would have killed us.</span> <span id="s806">And after a while they cleaned Ravensbruck out, too.</span> <span id="s807">Of course, my mother never came and only the younger sister of my sister-in-law came.</span> <span id="s808">She was 18 years old and she was sick already and I met her there.</span> <span id="s809">So, the first of May we went out of Malchow.</span> <span id="s810">They took us somewhere, they didn’t know themselves.</span> <span id="s811">We didn’t even have anymore SS men to watch us, only Wehrmacht, old men from sixty and up because they didn’t have any SS men to spare for us.</span> <span id="s812">So they took us again on the road and on the highways was already the Germans that came from Danzig that was running from the Russians and they wanted to reach the Americans or the English.</span> <span id="s813">And so we said to the, these soldiers didn’t know anymore where they are taking us, so they were glad that they mingled with the Germans on the road and we disappeared.</span> <span id="s814">So I was with this Yudith, this sister of my sister-in-law and a second cousin and two girls from the Pressburger Rabbi, the grandchildren.</span> <span id="s815">So we were five girls and we went now alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">EM: What did you wear, what did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s817">GT: I had still the boots, I had still my boots.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">EM: And what clothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s819">GT: And I had the striped clothes.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">EM: You still had the .</span> <span id="s821">.</span> <span id="s822">?</span></p> <p><span id="s823">GT: The striped clothes from Auschwitz, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">EM: But still in the striped clothing you were mingling with the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s825">GT: Ya, they didn’t mind anymore you know, because they had themselves got themselves … The soldiers shed the soldier’s uniforms and put on civilian clothes, you know.</span> <span id="s826">They all had [unclear] on the head, they all were afraid what these people, the Heftlings…</span></p> <p><span id="s827">EM: Prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s828">GT: But the prisoners were so weak they didn’t even think of killing these people, you know.</span> <span id="s829">They thought they would be killed by the prisoners, but the prisoners were so happy that the end is here that they wasn’t thinking of killing these people, at least 99% wasn’t thinking of it and just to be free.</span> <span id="s830">So many died because they ate too much, they ate too fast and they died from that.</span> <span id="s831">We five girls we went to a few villages and then we came to a city which was called Krivitz …</span></p> <p><span id="s832">EM: Krivitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s833">GT: Krivitz, yes, and, the first house I said, “Here we stop I can’t go further,” because I was tired.</span> <span id="s834">I was tired of shlepping Yudith.</span> <span id="s835">Yuditka was so sick and weak, and I said, “we stay here.”</span> <span id="s836">So, it was pronounced as a free city, with white flags outside and they were waiting for the Russians and the Russians came, maybe two, three hours after we was there.</span> <span id="s837">The Russians came and, like soldiers are, they wanted girls and we saw this is not a good thing to be here in the first house.</span> <span id="s838">They gave us food.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">EM: The Russians?</span></p> <p><span id="s840">GT: The Russians gave us food.</span> <span id="s841">They gave us noodles with something, I remember, but I thought I never ate such good food in my life.</span> <span id="s842">And so when I saw the situation I and the other girl, Trude was her name, we went to the town and was looking for a house to go in.</span> <span id="s843">So we went in a house and they said, “No, we never was Nazis, we was Social Democrats.”</span> <span id="s844">And so I said, “We want to stay here.”</span> <span id="s845">I don’t know where I had the courage, but I did.</span> <span id="s846">I said, “We have to come to you and we have to live here till further.”</span> <span id="s847">And they had a room outside of the house.</span> <span id="s848">I said Yudith should stay because she was so sick.</span> <span id="s849">“Yudith will stay in the house with you and we four girls will go stay in this outside room.”</span> <span id="s850">But then the evening came and the Russians came and they raped two of the Rabbi’s granddaughters and it was dark so I went under the bed and the other, the cousin of mine, somehow she made it outside.</span> <span id="s851">I was about three hours under the bed and the floors was from stone.</span> <span id="s852">I was frozen.</span> <span id="s853">Finally, these Russian soldiers went out.</span> <span id="s854">They was shooting in the ceilings, the revolvers.</span> <span id="s855">So then, it was maybe two o’clock in the night, so we all ran in the house and we lived there in the house till the Czechoslovakians.</span> <span id="s856">There was men already there, because the men from Oranienburg they was there, the prisoners, and there was a lot of Czechoslovakians from the city of Lidice, was all the men and woman there and so they put themselves together.</span> <span id="s857">And there was Antonin Zapoltowski, who became later the President, he was in, I think, Oranienburg, it doesn’t matter.</span> <span id="s858">It was a men’s Lager.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">EM: He was a Czech?</span></p> <p><span id="s860">GT: He was a Czech, yes.</span> <span id="s861">He was a Communist.</span> <span id="s862">He was a Communist Councilman and he was there for many years.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">EM: So he was in this town Krivitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s864">GT: Krivitz.</span> <span id="s865">And then there was this doctor Suki who was a Communist too, he was a lawyer.</span> <span id="s866">And there was already the Russians and the Russians gave them airplanes to fly because there was no tracks.</span> <span id="s867">You couldn’t go with a train and to this time airplanes was non-existent for civilian people, so for this Suki and Zapoltowski, he was an antisemite this Zapoltowski because with boys it was all Gentile men from Bohemia and he told them, “Why you going with all the Slovakian Jewish girls?</span> <span id="s868">Why you don’t go with the women from Lidice?”</span> <span id="s869">And so he organized them there and we went from Krivitz to New Brandenburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">EM: So you walked?</span></p> <p><span id="s871">GT: We walked, yes to New Brandenburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">EM: So it was a large group?</span></p> <p><span id="s873">GT: A large group of men and women from Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s874">We went to New Brandenburg and in New Brandenburg they sent this Dr. Suki and Zapoltowski with an airplane to Moscow and from Moscow to Prague and they organized camions to come for us and after days or so they came for us with the camions.</span> <span id="s875">.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">EM: What do you mean camions?</span></p> <p><span id="s877">GT: Trucks.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">EM: Oh, the trucks.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">GT: And they took us into Prague and in Prague they put us in an Internat, in the girls Internat because we looked so horrible.</span> <span id="s880">We were in such a condition that we couldn’t go home and nobody knew where to go home and when I felt better.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">EM: So it was a residence.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">GT: It was a residence, yes, and we got food there and it was clean there because it was like human beings are living.</span> <span id="s883">And in Prague I met a young man from my home town, Dr. Schwartz, and I said, “What should we do?”</span> <span id="s884">I was with Yudith and I was with my girlfriend and he said, “Don’t go home because nobody is home.”</span> <span id="s885">And Ladsi, my brother Ladsi, Ladislow was his name, we called him Ladsi, Ladsi was a partisan and he was stationed in Moravia, so he said, “It’s no use to go home for you.”</span> <span id="s886">So I sent my cousin home and I took Yudith because Yudith had nobody, the whole family was.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">EM: Killed?</span></p> <p><span id="s888">GT: Was killed, only my sister-in-law and my brother was in Bucharest.</span> <span id="s889">This was the only sister left for her and so I went to this town where I said we should go for my brother.</span> <span id="s890">My brother was there, but in the meantime my brother went to Prague to look for me and I looked for him there, and there I met again a boy from my hometown.</span> <span id="s891">He said, “No, no, Ladsi went to see you.”</span> <span id="s892">But we couldn’t stay there longer so I said, “I’m going home.</span> <span id="s893">If he comes back tell him I went home.”</span> <span id="s894">And I came to Zilina, another city we came with this Yudith.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">EM: Zilina?</span></p> <p><span id="s896">GT: Zilina, and there I met a boy from home too.</span> <span id="s897">He’s now in Israel, Mr. Stauber, from the shochet, the son, and he says don’t go home your sister is in Pesinov, this is a city near Bratislava with the two children, nobody is home.</span> <span id="s898">So I went again back to Bratislava, but Yudith was already halfway well so I put her on a bus and she went home, to her town, to her hometown.</span> <span id="s899">And I went to my sister and I went on the tracks because maybe two kilometers the trains couldn’t go on the tracks so I went on foot and I sprained my ankle.</span> <span id="s900">So, when I came to my sister, of course it was terrible to see each other again, not terrible, after all we went through.</span> <span id="s901">I stayed there for three weeks and then in-between my brother came and he brought us shoes and brought all kinds of things for us and he said go home.</span> <span id="s902">We had a house home, somebody lives there, but they know.</span> <span id="s903">He knew already that I am alive because he met girls from Auschwitz and they told him that I am alive and so he said, “You have there a room, furnished for you, and these people know that you are coming.”</span> <span id="s904">So I went home after three weeks and it was a terrible homecoming.</span> <span id="s905">It was maybe twelve o’clock in the night and the train didn’t go from the, how should I say, our town was a little away from that main…</span></p> <p><span id="s906">EM: Main railroad?</span></p> <p><span id="s907">GT: Main railroad.</span> <span id="s908">So we stopped there in this town of the main railroad.</span> <span id="s909">And I should have gone with the other train to my town to my hometown, but this train didn’t go.</span> <span id="s910">It was absolutely dark and somebody came with a wagon, with a big wagon, and we all sit down on this wagon and he took us home.</span> <span id="s911">And I came home and it was maybe 12 o’clock in the night and I was banging on the window and people came and so I came home all by myself.</span> <span id="s912">[Mrs. Truly is crying] It was a hard homecoming.</span> <span id="s913">Nobody was there.</span> <span id="s914">[weeping] I stayed there six weeks and then I went to my brother to Prague.</span> <span id="s915">I asked for… my father had four sisters and my mother had one brother in America and I wrote them right away, that was in June, beginning of June and I was asking for affidavits for me and my brother and in September we got the affidavits and we registered.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">EM: That was in what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s917">GT: In ’45 and we registered, but it took us three years.</span> <span id="s918">The Americans didn’t want to … In ’46 they let out a few, you know, but they stopped maybe after five, six hundred they stopped.</span> <span id="s919">And it took till ’48 till they finally gave out more permits and my brother had the number 900 and I had #1017, #1027 because I was somewhere else and he registered me meanwhile.</span> <span id="s920">And in three years, we went to America.</span> <span id="s921">And so ended the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">EM: And so you came in 1948?</span></p> <p><span id="s923">GT: 1948, May 15th and my brother came, went away from Prague one day after the revolution in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s924">I was so afraid they wouldn’t let him.</span> <span id="s925">It was really a “Putsch” – a communistic “Putsch”.</span> <span id="s926">He went away the 29th of February from Prague to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">EM: So tell me, how many brothers survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s928">GT: Three brothers survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">EM: Survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">GT: Really survived five of us, my sister survived with her two children, the husband didn’t come back.</span> <span id="s931">He went to Majdanek and there was a revolt and he was one of the…</span></p> <p><span id="s932">EM: Leaders?</span></p> <p><span id="s933">GT: Leaders and, of course, he was killed, so only this one sister with her husband and little boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">EM: They perished?</span></p> <p><span id="s935">GT: They perished in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s936">And my brothers…</span></p> <p><span id="s937">EM: One was a partisan you said?</span></p> <p><span id="s938">GT: The youngest was a partisan and the other ones was in Bucharest because they were Slovak citizens…</span></p> <p><span id="s939">EM: And they were never sent to…?</span></p> <p><span id="s940">GT: No, because they were foreigners in Bucharest so they didn’t and they knew a lot of people, you know, and they stayed there.</span> <span id="s941">And my sister married a man who was in Seret too after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">EM: Your sister?</span> <span id="s943">So she married …</span></p> <p><span id="s944">GT: She had two children.</span> <span id="s945">She met a man, she knew her husband was dead and she met a man there in Seret and after the war they was hidden, after the revolution, they were hidden by peasants.</span> <span id="s946">They went out of the Seret Lger and they came to the first village and they stopped there for overnight.</span> <span id="s947">The next day the Germans was there again and so they stayed in this peasant house for nine months in a shed over the cows, where the cows were, over there, there was a shed.</span> <span id="s948">It was maybe one and a half meters long and one and a half meters high and there they were five people, two men, my sister and the two kids, one was nine and one was ten, and they was nine months there.</span> <span id="s949">They could come only two o’clock in the night down and the peasants gave them food.</span> <span id="s950">The peasant, the man, went to the priest and he told him that he has these five people in the shed, what should he do.</span> <span id="s951">So the priest said to him, it was a village priest, he said to him, “If you... you know what will happen to you if they catch you, but if you have it in your heart to keep them then keep them.”</span> <span id="s952">And he kept them.</span> <span id="s953">And after the war, of course, everybody was … my sister, of course, he was paid, everything was paid and not only it was paid, but my sister went in ’49 with her family to Australia and she sent them, till she died, she sent them always everything what they needed and they met once.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">EM: But when they finally did it, they didn’t do it for money?</span> <span id="s955">Did they immediately …?</span></p> <p><span id="s956">GT: Maybe, one man had the money and he gave them what he had.</span> <span id="s957">But you can’t say that they did it only for money.</span> <span id="s958">They must have been human beings too, to do this.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">EM: Did you ever find out how come your mother, who was hidden first .</span> <span id="s960">.</span> <span id="s961">how come she found herself in …?</span></p> <p><span id="s962">GT: Yes, there was a couple, their name was Braun, too, like ours, and they were old people, they were maybe 85, old people, so the older children ran away or were caught too and sent away.</span> <span id="s963">They were rich people, they had a big store, they had a house, they had a big house, they were very religious, too.</span> <span id="s964">And my mother was not far from them hidden and they was sick people, old people, and my mother who was very charitative to everybody, she went in the night to cook for them, because they would have died of hunger.</span> <span id="s965">So she took them food from this man that she was hidden and she cooked for them.</span> <span id="s966">And once, in the night when she was there, the Hlinka guards came and they took them away and my mother was there and one of the men who knew my mother said to my mother, “Mrs. Braun, go away, get lost,” you know.</span> <span id="s967">And my mother didn’t care, she was so, she just wanted to, she just didn’t want to live alone [Mrs. Truly is crying].</span> <span id="s968">She wanted to be where her children are.</span> <span id="s969">That’s what I think, and that’s how she came to Ravensbruck.</span> <span id="s970">And my sister-in-law’s parents they went together.</span> <span id="s971">They was hidden too.</span> <span id="s972">Her mother was hidden too the whole time and she had to go away from this worker of ours and she was hidden in Levoce, but she came back to him, you know.</span> <span id="s973">So, she was caught there by these old people and they took these old people away and they died in the train.</span> <span id="s974">They didn’t even make it to the concentration camp and so my mother came to Ravensbruck.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">EM: Now, you came in 1948, you settled in New York and you got married in…?</span></p> <p><span id="s976">EM: He was a Jewish man?</span></p> <p><span id="s977">GT: He was a Jewish man, yes, not religious, absolutely not religious, but he was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">GT: I didn’t have children.</span> <span id="s979">My brother was here already so I didn’t go to the relatives.</span> <span id="s980">I had four aunts, two aunts here in New York and two aunts in Chicago and one uncle from my mother’s side here in New York.</span> <span id="s981">But my brother went to work the fourth or fifth day he went to work, for a man who had a soda fountain factory and luncheonette equipment.</span> <span id="s982">Because my father worked with tin, you know, and the boys was helping him always in the summertime, so he knew how to work with that and he knew how to read the plans because he was an interior decorator, he was very good in making plans, in drawings, so he made very good money.</span> <span id="s983">My aunt said, my son is born here and he’s a jeweler and he doesn’t make so much money as you.</span> <span id="s984">And I went to work, I came here with $10 because they didn’t allow more money to take out of Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s985">So I came here with $10, but I came to my brother already because he had the apartment already and after a week I went to work in the dress factory as a finisher, but I made enough money to sustain myself and so life went on.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">EM: Okay, I think we’re going to stop now and thank you very much.</span> <span id="s987">I hope it wasn’t too hard on you.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">GT: It was very hard.</span> <span id="s989">There was things that I never talk about, like about my sister and definitely not about my mother … because if something hurts you, you can’t talk about it.</span> <span id="s990">You can only talk about things that you can overcome, but about things what you can’t overcome you can’t talk.</span></p> <p><span id="s991">GT: I wanted to do this.</span> <span id="s992">I wanted to do this for my nephew because he was born here and he always tell me, “Ella, if you don’t leave something then we will never know what happened about the family.”</span> <span id="s993">He is very, very dear to me, so he said that “I have to know, I want to know it because of my family too.</span> <span id="s994">I want to tell it to my children.”</span> <span id="s995">I thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">EM: I’m going to make copies of the tapes so you will have it for your nephew and for yourself.</span> <span id="s997">Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">GT: Thank you, I really can’t tell you how grateful I am to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">EM: I’m grateful, really, thank you very much.</span> <span id="s1000">Its very important, all the testimonies are extremely important, so thank you again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">GT: I thank you.</span></p></body></html>
