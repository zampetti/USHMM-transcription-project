To get started I thought it would be a good idea to tell our listeners when you were born, and where.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Answer: I was born October 21, 1922, ow -- by coincident in Munich, because my mother was visiting her family there, she didn’t expect.</span> <span id="s18">But I was raised -- I went through the Holocaust in Stanislawow in Poland, southeast of Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: And if you would now give us your names.</span> <span id="s20">The name you had a birth, the name you took on during the war, and the name -- and your married name.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: First I have to start with a joke.</span> <span id="s22">My late parents called my Manya.</span> <span id="s23">First -- in the first grade I learned my name is Amalie when my teacher called out Amalie Petrenka to give me my report card.</span> <span id="s24">So this is the first time I learned that my name is Amalie, on -- and not Manya.</span> <span id="s25">When I started as a Christian Pole -- masquerading as a Christian Pole, I chose actually, my fictitious name, Felitsia Mewashefsky.</span> <span id="s26">I took Felitsia from Latin, Felitsia Felitsitakislak.</span> <span id="s27">Mewashefsky ma -- was my beloved writer, I liked her booked.</span> <span id="s28">So I dec -- and also, I had a German French r.</span> <span id="s29">When I was masquerading, I had to blend -- almost hundred percent the local population, to the Slavic r.</span> <span id="s30">So naturally, I tried to eliminate r from any possible word that I can -- that I can.</span> <span id="s31">Otherwise, probably, I would have remained Petrenka, because Petrenka is not a Jewish name.</span> <span id="s32">But, I have chosen Mewashefsky.</span> <span id="s33">I stayed with minash -- Mewashefsky till I got married to Norman s -- actually Naftali Salishitz at that time.</span> <span id="s34">So I became Amalie Salishitz.</span> <span id="s35">When we came to United States, he changed his name Salishitz to Salsitz, because his oldest brother, who was here for 20 years, at -- before m-my husband -- after my husband was born.</span> <span id="s36">So he wanted to have the same family name so he beca -- I became Amalie Salsitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: Let me ask you this, before we then go onto the duration.</span> <span id="s38">Who was Amalie Petrenka?</span> <span id="s39">Who was she as a girl, as a young person, and who was Felitsia Mewashefsky as a person?</span> <span id="s40">How did you feel about the change?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: Fala -- ama -- Amalie Petrenka was a very happy go lucky type, with shiny eyes that I didn’t know, but they were pointed out to me constantly, even during the war.</span> <span id="s42">I couldn’t carry for a long time, a grudge, or hatred.</span> <span id="s43">I loved people, but Amalie Salsitz was also fighter, because she was the middle child, so she fought for her rights, because my older sister was only year and a half older than I, and the younger, one year younger.</span> <span id="s44">And my parents wanted always to keep me with my younger sister.</span> <span id="s45">So I learned to fight for my rights.</span> <span id="s46">And, little mischievous, rebellious, this was Amalie Petrenka.</span> <span id="s47">As matter of fact, I have done things to big displeasure of my parents, because sometimes I questioned their judgment.</span> <span id="s48">For example, I come from middle or above class, and I got -- we -- private schooling, very expensive.</span> <span id="s49">So, when my parents complained about it, and they said for this money they could have traveled in Europe, I dared to tell them I didn’t ask to be born.</span> <span id="s50">This is not something in Europe, that parents appreciate.</span> <span id="s51">Felitsia Mewashefsky became a very cautious person that -- full of fear, and she played th -- la -- a -- helhole lak reeda payatso.</span> <span id="s52">Laughing during the day with people, the pillow all wet during the night.</span> <span id="s53">And afraid to face people, still she was exposed every time to people.</span> <span id="s54">Many times I walked with downcast eyes, although as a child I was told, supposedly, I have very beautiful eyes.</span> <span id="s55">I used to have very big one, and dark -- the eyelight -- eye white were even blue with the fair complexion and the fair hair, I guess it was outstanding, and the shiny eyes, like somebody who drinks.</span> <span id="s56">Here, I was downcast because I was afraid that people will recognize me.</span> <span id="s57">So, predominant factor in me was cautiousness, afraid, fearful, and in a way, also I decided I will fight Hitler with [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s58">I will prove to him that it is all really nothing, that it’s not true.</span> <span id="s59">I will excel so much, even as a Christian Pole, and be admired, to prove how false his theory was, which I succeeded.</span> <span id="s60">Many cases later -- maybe I will tell it i-if you want, later.</span> <span id="s61">So this was the Amalie.</span> <span id="s62">Still, this Felitsia Mewashefsky, if she could -- she c -- just couldn’t forget about the cultural life.</span> <span id="s63">Actually it was taboo to -- for Poles -- Christians, to go to movie houses, to go to resort, but Felitsia Mewashefsky was able to g -- venture to movie houses, no feedeutsch, no -- because I thought I’ll be less caught there.</span> <span id="s64">And I went -- for example, I have done things, like I went to the copanna, which was forbidden for Poles, just to prove my point.</span> <span id="s65">I felt also, I play with fire later on.</span> <span id="s66">If so, let me be caught to -- not only because I w -- am Jewish, but I have done things that even the Poles were not permitted, the Christians.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: We will speak later about all three of you, but especially who Amalie Salsitz became in the United States, but for the time being, let’s talk -- let’s go back a -- or stay with the time just before liberation.</span> <span id="s68">What was your state of mind, and what were the events that followed?</span> <span id="s69">A: Just few months before the liberation, were this first German evacuation.</span> <span id="s70">Was a very trying time for me because one part of Poland was liberated half year before I was liberated.</span> <span id="s71">I was tempted to run over to the Russian side, or the Russian -- o-or the la -- Jeshuf townoof, and to shorten my time of expectation, meantime I could have been killed.</span> <span id="s72">But then I decided it’s very risky, even to run to the Russian tine, so I will endure, and take my chances to legal -- to be liberated here, in Kraków, where I survived.</span> <span id="s73">And also, I was offered, and requested, by my two companies, the first company vi -- m -- batonin -- isen bentongbal by Wilhelm Langert from Swekow saxon, to evacuate with him and his company.</span> <span id="s74">I refused on the grounds that I don’t want to leave my motherland, Poland.</span> <span id="s75">And the same thing, first I was also requested to evacuate with the second company, Myrader and Krauss, the Viennese company, to evacute -- or evacuate with them to Vienna, and also I refused on the grounds that I don’t want to leave my motherland.</span> <span id="s76">I felt, why to endanger on my life now, towards the end.</span> <span id="s77">I didn’t expect the terrible anti-Semitism which was in Poland after liberation.</span> <span id="s78">So I decided not to take any chances, but to stay put in Poland.</span> <span id="s79">But nights, I always was contemplating if -- what should I do?</span> <span id="s80">What is the right thing to do?</span> <span id="s81">To run to the Russian oc -- and now conquered, liberated territories.</span> <span id="s82">And one thing, I don’t know if it’s important.</span> <span id="s83">Well, I -- I learned that I’m a little psychic.</span> <span id="s84">My dreams towards the end of the war were that I meet friends.</span> <span id="s85">Some friends embraced me, kissed me, were very happy to see me.</span> <span id="s86">My dearest friend, my childhood swee -- Julia Logbel, she pushed me away from her all the time.</span> <span id="s87">I couldn’t understand this, this was in my dreams.</span> <span id="s88">After the war, I found out that the people who pushed me away, like Alec Lamenstor, for example, my boyfriend who wanted -- we became fiancé, he pushed me away, they were all killed.</span> <span id="s89">Unbelievable.</span> <span id="s90">People that didn’t survive pushed me away.</span> <span id="s91">And people who survived, even that there was not so closed, and I didn’t think about them, survived.</span> <span id="s92">And I met them after the war, and then I told them, “I knew you were alive, because you aka -- embraced me, you greeted me.”</span> <span id="s93">So, this was the situation, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: Did you -- did you feel at the time when you dreamt it, did you interpret it then as a rejection, or did you interpret it as --</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: No, at first rejection.</span> <span id="s96">I cried, I -- I felt very badly, and I used to say, “I didn’t do anything wrong, why do you push me away?”</span> <span id="s97">Like my best friend -- no, I didn’t rationalize, only later, when I met, then I understood that this was the reason.</span> <span id="s98">So this is just before the liberation, and naturally I had to be double cautious.</span> <span id="s99">One way it was easier for me, because according to my assumed things, and false papers, because I was born supposedly in Vilna, I was safer, because if I was caught na -- in -- in this period, first thing they checked with the parish and police.</span> <span id="s100">The parish was already in the Russian hands.</span> <span id="s101">And, on the police, I had a legitimate cancarte made out on the fa -- a-assumed name, but they didn’t know it, and the s -- false baptismal paper.</span> <span id="s102">So I was safer in this respect, but still I had to be very, very careful.</span> <span id="s103">I had many incidents.</span> <span id="s104">Like after Myrader and hama -- this beton [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s105">I -- after they evacuated.</span> <span id="s106">So I was referred to organization Torte, which built the -- you know, [inaudible] th -- they built -- to protect, you know, ditches, ditches, to protect the armies, and to slow down the onslaught of the approaching enemy.</span> <span id="s107">And my boss wanted me to evacuate with them, too.</span> <span id="s108">I refused.</span> <span id="s109">But there was one employee, an a-accountant.</span> <span id="s110">He himself looked Jewish too, German, ricedeutsch.</span> <span id="s111">And he said to me, “Fraulein Felitsia, what do you celebrate, Sabbat?”</span> <span id="s112">I knew he recognized me, naturally I play dumb.</span> <span id="s113">Was still very dangerous period for me, very dangerous.</span> <span id="s114">I -- another one -- when -- in the new company, a Ukrainian, who worked in the bookkeeping department, turned to another white Russian, and he said to him, “You know what?</span> <span id="s115">I suspect that Felitsia Mewashefsky is a Jewess.”</span> <span id="s116">And he spoke it in front of the women with whom I lived, who was the daughter -- daughter-in-law of the building where the company was located.</span> <span id="s117">And the yow -- white Russian said, “Why do you go for her life?</span> <span id="s118">What did she do to you?”</span> <span id="s119">So there were some decent people, but still was very dangerous to the last moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: And then, in a very unexpected way, you met your husband to be.</span> <span id="s121">What -- what happened that -- that day?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: You see, when I was the secretary of the company, Myrader am-and Krauss, my boss, Klammenchitch, who happens be -- was a -- a Yugoslavian German, married to the daughter of the owner of the Myrader Krauss do -- Myrader’s daughter, and he -- when they were supposed to evacuate and I didn’t -- I refused to join them, he came over to me, and he said, “Listen, those are the keys from the safe.</span> <span id="s123">We will be back about two thr -- three months.</span> <span id="s124">Meanti -- you will manage the office, and you’ll pay out the checks.”</span> <span id="s125">He gave me the checks.</span> <span id="s126">Then he told me, “You will get some very important telephone call, and cooperate.”</span> <span id="s127">But didn’t explain what will be the phone call, from whom.</span> <span id="s128">Just after I think two or three days, I’m not exact -- so sure now, I got a phone call from the camp’s commandanten, from Kraków military camp.</span> <span id="s129">And he ha -- just identify if this is the company Myrader and Krauss.</span> <span id="s130">I said yavolt.</span> <span id="s131">And the command came, “Springen sie de zoilen.”</span> <span id="s132">Now, the -- I didn’t know anything about zoilen.</span> <span id="s133">I know -- knew only that my co -- the company built bunkers a-around big office building -- German office.</span> <span id="s134">And I didn’t know -- I saw the pyramids like form on the main thoroughfares, but I was not -- I-I-I -- informed, and I didn’t know that this is the company our built, and those are the zoilen, but I connected immediately.</span> <span id="s135">Now, I had to think very fast.</span> <span id="s136">Had I been a German, I would have told them that they must do it themselves because my company evacuated.</span> <span id="s137">And then I said, “I can save this city being ruined.”</span> <span id="s138">A-And -- not that -- a-after all, it is a historic sto -- city, Kraków, but not that all -- all in the Poles, that they helped me to survive.</span> <span id="s139">But still, it is the country where I lived.</span> <span id="s140">And I was thinking also for -- I analyzed the danger what will be for me, not to tell them to do themselves, and being I was not the only one left in the office.</span> <span id="s141">There was -- still was the lady Lydia Lu-Lublevska, the daughter-in-law.</span> <span id="s142">There was -- still was maintenance men, two chambermaids, and hi -- they didn’t ask me who was speaking, so I thought I am not endangering my life, because I can always deny receiving the phone call.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: I just want to say for our listeners that the Swengsvi zoilen, the translation is dynamite the columns.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: Detonate.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: Detonate the columns.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: And so, after a few days, three man came, three knocked ma -- ma -- m --at the gate of the building where ma -- [indecipherable] where the office was, and I told to the m-maintenance man, I told him, “Listen, now be a terrible, unstable situation, very dangerous, because this is now a German section, German building.</span> <span id="s147">People may want to come to plunder.</span> <span id="s148">They wouldn’t know to kill, but definitely to plunder.</span> <span id="s149">Don’t open the iron gate till I will let you know.”</span> <span id="s150">So when the three officers came, we -- I saw them through the window, I told him not to open.</span> <span id="s151">And they knocked -- then they came again.</span> <span id="s152">When they came again, among them was one officer who looked like a Jew.</span> <span id="s153">So I said from this quarter cannot be any danger.</span> <span id="s154">So I will find out what they want, and I will explain what it is.</span> <span id="s155">So I told the man to open the gate, he let them in, they came to my office, and among them was my present husband Norman Salsitz.</span> <span id="s156">Norman was in -- wi -- in a leather coat.</span> <span id="s157">Norman looks very Slavic.</span> <span id="s158">And after they checked who we are, they dwelt on me, they stop with me.</span> <span id="s159">And my husband started, a very nasty in -- interrogation.</span> <span id="s160">Finally, I got very mad.</span> <span id="s161">Who I am, I show the ID, it’s impossible that I am Felitsia Mewashefsky, a Pole, to be a such sensitive job, that I’m lying.</span> <span id="s162">So I said, “If -- so take me to your superiors.”</span> <span id="s163">So he told me, “I am the superior.”</span> <span id="s164">And thr-threatened me, and to frighten me, he a -- opened his coat where the -- his gun was there, a revolver.</span> <span id="s165">And I said, “For God sake, it’s towards the end of the war.</span> <span id="s166">I don’t have to take anything from such a anti-Semite.”</span> <span id="s167">I got annoyed, and I called the officer who looked Jewish to the other room that I want to talk to him.</span> <span id="s168">In the other room when we came, he se -- asked me, “Well, who are you?”</span> <span id="s169">I said, “I’m Jewish, I am the same that you are.”</span> <span id="s170">“How do you know?”</span> <span id="s171">I said, “Look at your face.”</span> <span id="s172">You know, this the saying in Europe.</span> <span id="s173">So, “From where are you?”</span> <span id="s174">I said, “From Saint Swabof, from where are you?”</span> <span id="s175">He said, “I am from Kraków.”</span> <span id="s176">I said, “Kraków, we had many refugees during the Russian occupation, and one of them I befriended was in my Jewish gimnasium, by the name Oskar Margolies.”</span> <span id="s177">Lo and behold, this Oskar Margolies was his first cousin.</span> <span id="s178">From all the people in the world, what an accountant.</span> <span id="s179">Ver -- very emotion from Miskey.</span> <span id="s180">Naturally, he ask about his fate, and then we went in.</span> <span id="s181">He came over to Norman, and told him to leave me alone, that I’m okay.</span> <span id="s182">And he whispered that I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s183">Norman didn’t believe till he started interrogo-gated me -- interrogating me again, because he knew this Yamen Miskey to be a womanizer, he thought, God knows.</span> <span id="s184">And he -- he sta -- th-then somehow, in back of his mind, he said maybe, maybe she is Jewish.</span> <span id="s185">And it was very danger -- the situation was not stable to reveal that I am Jewish, because in case the Russians retreat, the Germans come, then they -- I’m exposed as a Jew, and they kill me.</span> <span id="s186">Oo -- iha -- it happened many times.</span> <span id="s187">So this is one, he decided to be more careful.</span> <span id="s188">He ask if I s -- speak other languages.</span> <span id="s189">I said yes.</span> <span id="s190">“What?”</span> <span id="s191">I said, “Russian, German,” and I couldn’t say Hebrew, because I was afraid they will understand.</span> <span id="s192">So he switch to his broken English, as little as he knew, what nationality I am.</span> <span id="s193">I said I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s194">He didn’t believe, so he started again about Jewish religion, and -- and custom, and then he asked me [inaudible] about the very sacred day in our Jewish life, Yom Kippur, the big atonement day that every Jew knows, and he asked me what we say on Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s195">When he asked me this question, only a Jew kn-knows.</span> <span id="s196">Then I knew that he is Jewish, too.</span> <span id="s197">I answered immediately Yom Kippur, then, with tears from my eyes I said, “You too?</span> <span id="s198">You too Jewish?”</span> <span id="s199">And this is how we met.</span> <span id="s200">So then we -- but, because we [indecipherable] he sa -- I told him I speak Hebrew too, and I called him names in Hebrew, I did.</span> <span id="s201">So he thought being I’m young, that the Germans taught me Hebrew in order I should spy on Jews and give them out -- not that I am Jewish, because they have done it.</span> <span id="s202">So they taught me Hebrew so perfect in order to fish out the poor Jews who were masquerading as Gentile.</span> <span id="s203">So then we switched to Polish, and then he stated the reason why he came.</span> <span id="s204">And s -- th -- I said, “Why didn’t you tell me right away?</span> <span id="s205">Why did I have to go through such interrogation, and you know it?”</span> <span id="s206">I was so aggravated.</span> <span id="s207">And so I took him to the office across, because the -- those were the living quarters, I took him to -- across the hall, to the office, and I gave him the plans of the pyramids, of the columns that were erected, because there was a master plan, so they didn’t -- they could deton -- detonate it.</span> <span id="s208">And this is how I met Norman.</span> <span id="s209">Started with hate.</span> <span id="s210">He actually came to kill me, and as matter of fact, they were discussing who is the one who will kill me, because they were afraid after I give the plans I can get in touch with the ca -- m-military commandant, and tell them already that they have the plans.</span> <span id="s211">A-And even my husband felt badly because it came upon him to kill, and he felt he never killed a woman, even if she’s German, even all his sisters were killed by the Germans, all his gra -- nieces and nephews, but still he couldn’t bring himself.</span> <span id="s212">So this is the story.</span> <span id="s213">From hatred, for wanted to kill me, we fell in love, we got married, and here we are, married, will be in October, 54 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: Let’s tal -- [inaudible] just a tiny little bit more [inaudible].</span> <span id="s215">Let’s -- let’s speak a little bit more about what happened then, though.</span> <span id="s216">Your -- your courtship developed over a period of time.</span> <span id="s217">He was busy, you were doing things.</span> <span id="s218">Ex-Explain a little bit more about th-the time [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: Actually, mine -- I ha -- this was also something.</span> <span id="s220">I was of age, 22, when the Polish army drafted women to the army.</span> <span id="s221">And the army was actually under the Communist authority, you know, they were satellites.</span> <span id="s222">And -- and that’s why I didn’t want to go.</span> <span id="s223">So the first thing, I went to -- at that time he was Tadoush Szaleski, in the high position, and I said, “I don’t want to be drafted.”</span> <span id="s224">And, also they wanted to expel me from this beautiful German apartment, and -- a woman.</span> <span id="s225">So he put his name, that he lives there.</span> <span id="s226">Then, I wanted to continue with my studies.</span> <span id="s227">I wanted to go to medical school, that’s what I planned.</span> <span id="s228">So, Norm -- it was very hard to get into medical school, s -- priority had only the one who started already.</span> <span id="s229">So Norman, because of high position, was able for me to work out, I should be accepted.</span> <span id="s230">Because they said they had certain number of places for students who are Communist.</span> <span id="s231">If I will declare that I am a Communist, I am accepted.</span> <span id="s232">And I told Norman, “I never was, I’m not, and for this I will not put the ti -- I am in order to be accepted.”</span> <span id="s233">But because of his connections, and high position, I was accepted.</span> <span id="s234">But I had to go through ast -- extra -- you know, old subjects, because I didn’t have any papers.</span> <span id="s235">I had to take all the exams, [indecipherable] from -- to make my matriculation, I was accepted.</span> <span id="s236">But then, Norman couldn’t stay in Kraków because of his position, and he traced a lot of Akar, Poles from the national government in London, whose aim was to get rid of Germans and Jews, and kill the lot.</span> <span id="s237">So Norman discovered many, so the ha -- the ground was too hot for him.</span> <span id="s238">And I was able to obta -- obtain for him a transfer to -- first to Lipnitsa Breslau, a -- but we didn’t want to stay in Poland.</span> <span id="s239">So I was not busy, my -- actually what I occupied myself, I tried to help the people who came out from concentration camp, in tatters, hungry, starving, till it was organized, till they could get some help from o -- Jewish organization.</span> <span id="s240">So Norman supplied for me, and I used to go -- I used to find them from Plaszów, living in one room, four or five, sick, emaciated, bringing food, helping.</span> <span id="s241">And others -- and through grapeline they found out that I have clothes I can give them, and they used to come.</span> <span id="s242">So was mostlal welfare.</span> <span id="s243">Not official, but wel-welfare.</span> <span id="s244">And then in Breslau, I could have enrolled again to medical school, but I saw the anti-Semitism in Poland, and I felt it’s a Communist Poland.</span> <span id="s245">I didn’t survive the war to go from one jail to another.</span> <span id="s246">And my only goal and strength to survive was to be reunited with my family that I had at that time in Palestine, from Germany.</span> <span id="s247">My grandmother, my sister, my mother’s brothers, cousins, uncles.</span> <span id="s248">So this gave me the strength, but I -- because I knew, although I’m the sole survivor from the family who was in Poland during the Holocaust, but I am not an orphan completely, because I still had a good maternal grandmother and uncles in Palestine at that time, and I will be able to be reunited with them.</span> <span id="s249">So I felt, how can I stay in Poland?</span> <span id="s250">Here I endanger my life, because the Poles started the pogroms, killing of Jews.</span> <span id="s251">Personna non grata.</span> <span id="s252">This is not a reason why I survived.</span> <span id="s253">And because legally we couldn’t leave Poland, so we escaped illegally to Munich.</span> <span id="s254">So this is -- otherwise there were gatherings with struyas -- survivors, and really we felt like family, like blood relations because we were -- like Imann, he lost everybody, but didn’t have even a brother, anyone.</span> <span id="s255">At least I had, they didn’t.</span> <span id="s256">So we clung to each other.</span> <span id="s257">We sha -- we looked for solace in each other’s arms.</span> <span id="s258">So this was till we escaped -- till I arranged a escape.</span> <span id="s259">First my husband, because my brother-in-law decided that he has a store, and has to liquidate.</span> <span id="s260">So the wife doesn’t belong to the husband.</span> <span id="s261">I had to stay with my older brother-in-law, till he liquidates me, then my husband escaped.</span> <span id="s262">I arranged for him.</span> <span id="s263">And later we found -- we were supposed to meet in the Jewish communion house in Munich, but unfortunately, my husband was not there.</span> <span id="s264">After I struggled, after I almost got killed crossing illegally the border, because I brought some of our belongings.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: Maybe we should stop here to flip over.</span> <span id="s266">[indecipherable] This is the end of tape one, side A, with Amalie Salsitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Amalie Salsitz.</span> <span id="s269">This is tape number one, side B. Before we go on to what happened afterwards, I would just like to ask you about liberation.</span> <span id="s270">So often the word suggests a beautiful, brief moment.</span> <span id="s271">That was the moment of liberation.</span> <span id="s272">But the feelings were more complicated for you, were they not?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: Can you speak a little bit more about the liberation, and having survived?</span> <span id="s275">What did that mean to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: One way, again, I decided I have to survive, to bear witness, in spite of Hitler’s theory, but when I found myself liberated, and you couldn’t stop and question, where are my loved ones?</span> <span id="s277">You couldn’t accept it.</span> <span id="s278">Why I?</span> <span id="s279">Why not my sister, the lovely Celia, 17 ye -- years co -- killed.</span> <span id="s280">Why not my beautiful mother, 41 years old?</span> <span id="s281">Why not my father, 45 years old?</span> <span id="s282">Not speaking about my cousins, uncles, and not speaking of my dear friends, my childhood friends.</span> <span id="s283">So it -- it was a mixed feeling, one laced with like guilt, why I -- why was I chosen?</span> <span id="s284">And then, naturally, relief, that finally it’s over, and I can be a free person, and I can do, and -- and not -- threat of death, the Damocles sword over my head, that was for me since ’41 till ’45.</span> <span id="s285">But it was not the real joy, not like that you would accomplished something very big, because the price you pay for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: How -- how did you decide where to go, to po -- where to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: My only stand -- I mentioned was the knowledge that I still have family in Palestine at that time.</span> <span id="s288">So naturally, the choice was I have to be reunited with them.</span> <span id="s289">But, when it was proven, when we escaped from -- to Germany, and because of the policy of Great Britain, was not permitted to immigrate to Palestine, I didn’t want to risk again, and to be caught -- sent to Cyprus, a-and God knows for how long, and then to Palestine.</span> <span id="s290">So I felt all roads are leading to Rome.</span> <span id="s291">Doesn’t matter which I take.</span> <span id="s292">Being that Jews had an opportunity to -- under joint certific -- group certificate to immigrate to United States, I decided to take what comes first, and then I will go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s293">What I have done.</span> <span id="s294">Now, to United States is a story I must tell you.</span> <span id="s295">We know we cannot stay in Germany.</span> <span id="s296">Each face I scrutinized, I couldn’t look -- and it was a terrible emotional -- terrible emotional for me, because everyone I looked, is this the killer?</span> <span id="s297">Is this the killer of my parents, my family, my sister, my beloved ones?</span> <span id="s298">Oh, we knew we cannot stay in Germany.</span> <span id="s299">We tried to make it as brief as possible, but in order to immigrate to United States, we needed papers to get visa.</span> <span id="s300">Ironically, the Germans who applied had all the papers, they didn’t have any difficulties, and they were processed very fast.</span> <span id="s301">We survivors, who didn’t have any papers, or the one who survived the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s302">Or like I, who had to leave everything, any scrap of paper which will identify me, and be under assumed, I didn’t, so we couldn’t be processed, we couldn’t be -- get -- obtain a visa.</span> <span id="s303">So finally, my husband and I, we decided to approach the general council, explain the situation, what it is, and that something must be done.</span> <span id="s304">Some Jews bribed the secretary -- again, who was the secretary?</span> <span id="s305">A German Christian.</span> <span id="s306">And they -- some -- she let them go -- approach to co -- to present it to their ambassador of council.</span> <span id="s307">So one day, lunch time, we accosted the general council, by the name Clark, and we ask him in our English, broken English, that i-if -- for audience, we want to explain some situation.</span> <span id="s308">After we explain to him, he got up, he was very tall.</span> <span id="s309">He put his hands on our heads, and said, “Now, set children must come to United States.”</span> <span id="s310">He changed the law that it is far -- enough if two eye witnesses, notarized, will give testimony that they know the person, where it ca -- was born and when.</span> <span id="s311">And this will be accepted.</span> <span id="s312">So, in a way, we changed the law.</span> <span id="s313">And we helped a lot of survivors this way.</span> <span id="s314">So finally, when our papers came through -- meantime was very hard for my husband too, because -- in the trolley cars and the many compiljamas -- complaints, so many -- so many refugees, that they brought them as slave workers was okay.</span> <span id="s315">So my husband started fights, fistfights, killi -- you know, he got bruised, he will not let it go.</span> <span id="s316">I souta -- so the ground is very hot, we have to leave.</span> <span id="s317">So luckily, after we got the visa, we were sent to the camp -- immigration camp in Bremenhaven, but we have to stay there for half year because in United States was a coal strike.</span> <span id="s318">So till we be able to leave, it was January.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: How did you live during that time?</span> <span id="s320">Who -- who gave you food or clothes [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: Many, many Jews were in DP camps, so Joint supported.</span> <span id="s322">I somehow avoided camps, I just didn’t want to go to the camps.</span> <span id="s323">I -- I d -- wasn’t doin -- in the camp during the war -- I masqueraded, I lived openly, I didn’t.</span> <span id="s324">So we lived on our resources.</span> <span id="s325">The black market was flourishing, so we got cigarettes, we bought food, we bought clothing, and this how we sustained ourselves.</span> <span id="s326">In Munich again, many of my schoolmates who survived -- ma -- not many survived.</span> <span id="s327">Many -- I will say, five, four, the m -- enrolled in UNRRA University.</span> <span id="s328">A -- being I knew I cannot stand in Germany, I will not be able with my husband.</span> <span id="s329">So I didn’t enroll, and when the time came, we immigrated to United States.</span> <span id="s330">And from United States, luckily of my schooling, I was able to become a Hebrew teacher, and at ‘49, they had the first chartered plane to Hebrew University in Jerusalem for Hebrew teachers, to supplement their -- and enrich their knowledge in Hebrew.</span> <span id="s331">So we decided to go to be among them, although we didn’t have even still, citizen paper.</span> <span id="s332">We had only the green papers, we caused a lot of trouble for the whole group, because each time we were the -- they were detained because of us, still they checked thoroughly, they didn’t like it so much.</span> <span id="s333">But finally -- and this is when we came, in ’49, to Pala -- Israel [indecipherable] was Israel state after the war of liberation, where I had the reunion with my sister, my grandmother, with my uncles, with the whole family, and Norman with his brother.</span> <span id="s334">And, it was a very moving, touching, naturally, situation.</span> <span id="s335">And when I shared with them my experience, they just couldn’t believe such atrocity took place.</span> <span id="s336">They thought -- and my sister, who left in ’39, who survived in Palestine, marrying palestin -- British subject, she thought that I got a nervous breakdown.</span> <span id="s337">She ju -- they just couldn’t accept.</span> <span id="s338">Yes, they knew that my mother wa-was killed, but also the atrocities, only when this was Eichmann trial televised, I got a long letter from my sister Babka, apologizing for not understanding, and not being able to accept or comprehend it.</span> <span id="s339">On -- after so many witnesses testified, and she -- now she learned that this was true, she felt so guilty, so badly.</span> <span id="s340">But this what happened to us survivors, all of them.</span> <span id="s341">So the job for the deniers in the beginning was easy, because nobody could understand the atrocities.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: I would li -- I’ll come back to is -- to Israel again, because I have some follow up questions, but let’s go back to the time when you arrived.</span> <span id="s343">How did you go to the United States?</span> <span id="s344">By boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: This is another story, terrible one.</span> <span id="s346">W -- Joint paid for us for passage like any other passenger, tourist class, not first class.</span> <span id="s347">We were women assigned 48 to one cabin, three tiers ba -- bunks.</span> <span id="s348">Men were hundred on the C deck, like cockroaches on the floor, on the C deck.</span> <span id="s349">Germans who got papers got second class and first rate accommodation.</span> <span id="s350">First class not the same money, but the others, they were just assigned a family to a cabin.</span> <span id="s351">Norman, my husband, got very, very sick, seasickness.</span> <span id="s352">It was very rough weather, this was 14 days in the crossing.</span> <span id="s353">So, after three days, when he was completely dehydirted -- dehydrated, I decided to dress him up as a woman.</span> <span id="s354">I gave him a scarf, and a dress, and I arranged with another survivor that I will give him my bunk, and I will sleep with her.</span> <span id="s355">As a matter of fact, she is here, United States.</span> <span id="s356">And her name was Zwotorilka Zwotto.</span> <span id="s357">So when they checked the cabins, if there is not socializing, because we were not permitted with our -- to be with our spouses, like the Germans.</span> <span id="s358">We were women separated.</span> <span id="s359">So -- in different even dining room.</span> <span id="s360">So there was a woman with a scarf, and they didn’t know.</span> <span id="s361">This how we passed.</span> <span id="s362">Tor -- as a matter -- he wished he should -- death upon him.</span> <span id="s363">After what you went through, s -- he was so seasick.</span> <span id="s364">But the last day, when we s -- were told that we are approaching the Statue of Liberty, and -- New York harbor, natural we dressed up all in our best, and we went on the deck.</span> <span id="s365">And this was some moment, seeing the Statue of Liberty, the torch, the liberty.</span> <span id="s366">Ah -- we were elated, finally we are liberated.</span> <span id="s367">We came -- we arrived, we didn’t have to go to Ellis Island, because at that time they checked us in Germany, in the special office of immigration, and when we arrived at the pier, they grouped us according to the alphabet.</span> <span id="s368">Staying there under the S, Salsitz, a guy in lumberjacket comes -- approaches me again, and asks me if I know a family sal -- Salishitz, he’s supposed to come.</span> <span id="s369">I said, “We are Salishitz.”</span> <span id="s370">It was Norman’s second cousin.</span> <span id="s371">Being he had an [indecipherable] across this pier, he knew everybody, and he got the permission to enter, and to be the first one who greeted us, and outside was waiting Norman’s brother Al, who immigrated the year when Norman was born, i -- to United States, and his family was very emotional, and very warm, and this brother took us to his house.</span> <span id="s372">Well, we stated for a month, I think, till we got our apartment.</span> <span id="s373">But about a house, another story.</span> <span id="s374">In my dreams -- it’s unbelievable, I never thought about United States, because my whole family in Palestine, and I thought that after liberation, we’ll go straight there.</span> <span id="s375">I saw a red brick house.</span> <span id="s376">I never had seen such style of house in my town in Poland.</span> <span id="s377">When we approached the house in Brooklyn, tomor -- in Flatbush, where Norman’s brother Al lived, this was the house.</span> <span id="s378">And I too -- pointed to him.</span> <span id="s379">He said, “How do you know?”</span> <span id="s380">I said, “I saw it in my dreams.”</span> <span id="s381">I never thought -- I had never been -- and, like I said, I never thought after liberation that I will be in United States.</span> <span id="s382">So we stayed with him for a month, then by coincident, traveling on the subway, we were approached by the old -- elder man Italia.</span> <span id="s383">His name was Rosario.</span> <span id="s384">With broken English he asked us who are we, and so.</span> <span id="s385">And we told him that we are survivors, refugees, and we are looking for apartment.</span> <span id="s386">He offered his apartment -- he was by 72 years old.</span> <span id="s387">He said he never became a citizen.</span> <span id="s388">His wife and family are still in Italy, and he sa -- decided now to reun -- to reunite with them, so he offered his apartment for nothing, rent-free, so long he stay still, to share with us.</span> <span id="s389">And this how we got the first apartment, where also Norman’s cousin lived, and the daughter.</span> <span id="s390">And the cousin, it’s by coincidence you -- she came -- she was a widow, she was brought by this cousin who -- the lumberjacket -- Jack Rodbot at the pier.</span> <span id="s391">She was brought over very -- she was a widow.</span> <span id="s392">Very nice woman, and she taught me how to cook.</span> <span id="s393">Her daughter Regina offered -- found for me the first job, and for Norman.</span> <span id="s394">For Norman he wor -- walked to the ink company that he hated.</span> <span id="s395">It’s was physical, and he thought he will get crazy, because didn’t absorb -- his mind had to be busy, especially a big shot in Poland after the war, here he’s mixing ink with another two black men, he thought he will get crazy.</span> <span id="s396">And she got me a job in the tie factory.</span> <span id="s397">But I had to sit with my head down, and m -- probably not nourish enough, my blood used to come I -- from my nose all the time.</span> <span id="s398">On top of it, she said I even don’t make minimum quota of ties.</span> <span id="s399">She said, “Look, I would like to keep you.”</span> <span id="s400">She was a German refuge.</span> <span id="s401">So I quit the job.</span> <span id="s402">And I said, “For God’s sake, my parents spent so much money on my Hebrew education.</span> <span id="s403">I’m a qualified teacher, why not look in this field?”</span> <span id="s404">And this how I got a job, half year later, in the first Hebrew school, in -- on Avenue P, Magen Davide.</span> <span id="s405">And then I switched to another one, which was a very religious school for boys in Borapart ats haim.</span> <span id="s406">And this how star -- I started on my career as a teacher, which I just quit 15 years ago.</span> <span id="s407">And I was doing -- and very happy, and quite successful, because for 10 years, I didn’t have any children.</span> <span id="s408">My whole love to children went to my schoolch -- pupils, and they felt it.</span> <span id="s409">Children feel it.</span> <span id="s410">And they reciprocated.</span> <span id="s411">It was a beautiful relationship.</span> <span id="s412">As a matter of fact, I was able to handle the hardest cases the principal gave me.</span> <span id="s413">I think because of my love and understanding.</span> <span id="s414">They used to wait for me after la -- lessons, to talk to me.</span> <span id="s415">And they had problems, because this was the time the divorces.</span> <span id="s416">It affected very much the children, and they talked to me about it, and I patiently listened.</span> <span id="s417">I had cases where the student from first grade ask me if I will wait for him, he gets older, he wants to marry me.</span> <span id="s418">You know the stories.</span> <span id="s419">And waiting -- walking me to school.</span> <span id="s420">It was really love.</span> <span id="s421">My chil -- my daughter was born --</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: Did you want -- had -- did you want children?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: In the beginning, no.</span> <span id="s424">I was not ready.</span> <span id="s425">In the beginning, I felt what will I teach my child.</span> <span id="s426">She will ask me about her grandparents, everything.</span> <span id="s427">To lie I didn’t want.</span> <span id="s428">They didn’t die, they were killed.</span> <span id="s429">Teach your child.</span> <span id="s430">When it’s three, starts asking kill, who?</span> <span id="s431">By Hitler, cruel man.</span> <span id="s432">Where is God?</span> <span id="s433">God is our father.</span> <span id="s434">Why did he permit it?</span> <span id="s435">Why didn’t he protect us?</span> <span id="s436">Which, later, I encountered.</span> <span id="s437">So I didn’t want that.</span> <span id="s438">I was not emotionally ready, I didn’t want.</span> <span id="s439">But then when, finally, I decided I did -- I think it was by three or four years after the war, we decided to have a child.</span> <span id="s440">So it didn’t come as we wanted.</span> <span id="s441">As a matter of fact, it took us ta -- our daughter was born to our 11th anniversary.</span> <span id="s442">Meantime, we want to adopt.</span> <span id="s443">We were refused, because medically we were found able to have children.</span> <span id="s444">And when we couldn’t even if -- we approached the black market.</span> <span id="s445">The same time I was pregnant three months with my daughter, I got a phone call from Philadelphia that they have a baby girl for our adopt.</span> <span id="s446">But naturally, I didn’t accept it.</span> <span id="s447">First of all, I said, what right do I have to do it?</span> <span id="s448">Another parent who cannot have a child, and I am having.</span> <span id="s449">And what will do to raise two children, one mine, and no -- will have to be mine.</span> <span id="s450">So I declined, and this is when my daughter was born, and then we had problems.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: Yeah, I wi -- I will make that connection to -- to the problems.</span> <span id="s452">One more question.</span> <span id="s453">Were people in America at that time ready to hear about your experiences, and did you want to talk about them?</span> <span id="s454">A: No, the people were not ready, they didn’t want.</span> <span id="s455">They felt guilty for number of years, Jews, and non-Jews.</span> <span id="s456">Jews were also complaining that they had had ration card, they suffered.</span> <span id="s457">They didn’t have enough meat and sugar.</span> <span id="s458">And they felt guilty that they didn’t do too much.</span> <span id="s459">Th -- like the black people marches to Washington and everything?</span> <span id="s460">Not.</span> <span id="s461">There was only one group, the very Orthodox Jews, and they saved some Jews.</span> <span id="s462">So they didn’t want to hear about it.</span> <span id="s463">Norman was ready to talk about it all the time.</span> <span id="s464">I saw the lack of understanding in the first years, so I decided what to waste my time, and emotional to open my wounds all the time, I decided to wait, when it’s right.</span> <span id="s465">But in school I had to because they started teaching about the Holocaust, but you s --</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: When was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: In school that they started to teach?</span> <span id="s468">I think ’50, ’51, ’52.</span> <span id="s469">And also, when -- you see now how I get emotional.</span> <span id="s470">So I used to cry.</span> <span id="s471">I didn’t want to, I couldn’t control.</span> <span id="s472">So I reduce as much as possible [indecipherable] I talked.</span> <span id="s473">So then did we decided after all -- and Norman spoke and told all the time.</span> <span id="s474">And so are -- we decided we have to write a book, because after all, why did we survive, if not to bear witness for the victims?</span> <span id="s475">We must share our experience.</span> <span id="s476">And naturally there was -- they crept up, the deniers, the revisionists.</span> <span id="s477">So we said, if we will not do anything about it, they will win.</span> <span id="s478">So this where we started.</span> <span id="s479">Now, we had bad experiences, too.</span> <span id="s480">Not so much I, like Norman.</span> <span id="s481">You know when you among educated people, professional people, you accepted.</span> <span id="s482">And it doesn’t matter.</span> <span id="s483">Like you, it doesn’t matter if you have a accent or not, you’re accepted.</span> <span id="s484">But when you go -- first he was a peddler -- lower class, blue collar.</span> <span id="s485">Why did you survive?</span> <span id="s486">How comes you -- you are alive?</span> <span id="s487">Why aren’t you ne -- any misunderstanding, anything, why weren’t you not gassed?</span> <span id="s488">You know how painful it was?</span> <span id="s489">So he went through a lot.</span> <span id="s490">As a matter of fact, in the beginning, he wanted even to commit suicide.</span> <span id="s491">He just couldn’t accept.</span> <span id="s492">The family was not warm either.</span> <span id="s493">Again, I was lucky.</span> <span id="s494">I had only here a fa -- my father’s brother’s family.</span> <span id="s495">The oldest one, from Berlin, they left in ’38, the last ship.</span> <span id="s496">And I was received beautiful, till today.</span> <span id="s497">My aunt -- although her husband was -- she was divorced from him, she took me in like a child, and she made sure that her children accepted me as a child of the family.</span> <span id="s498">There was not Friday dinner, any holiday, that she didn’t include.</span> <span id="s499">So much that her har -- son Leor, who graduated in Berlin, but he went here to Columbia, he was -- he is a artist, commercial artist, he was later director very big com -- advertising company, Beore.</span> <span id="s500">He was single.</span> <span id="s501">On every date, he took Norman and I. He’s the one who took us all over, any concert.</span> <span id="s502">Tavern on the Green, to Carnegie Hall, Radio City, explained the architecture.</span> <span id="s503">Beautiful, felt family.</span> <span id="s504">On my mother’s side, my grandmother’s -- Rifka Genga’s sister, Esther Inglestein, when she found out we don’t have any religious wedding, to her it’s blasphemy, sin.</span> <span id="s505">We lived in sin.</span> <span id="s506">She made the wedding in her apartment, by t -- she invited about 20 people.</span> <span id="s507">The rabbi was a cousin who officiated, and her oldest son Harold, till today, now he’s 89 -- there was, when his wife was even alive, Doris, she was for -- she immigrated from Vienna, actual -- re-refugee -- oh, it was in ’38, like family, again.</span> <span id="s508">A-Any family gathering, any holiday.</span> <span id="s509">So we had a home.</span> <span id="s510">Norman had a tremendous family here.</span> <span id="s511">Only the poor uncle, his father’s brother, Uncle Shulamoon, he is the one who cared, who wanted the vano -- to get the job, to find a job for Norman, was always in touch, was very warm.</span> <span id="s512">But his children, and so many others, they didn’t even invite us for dinner.</span> <span id="s513">Only later on, when we became successful, suddenly we got phone calls.</span> <span id="s514">So Norman was very disappointed.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: How did you feel -- did you get -- did you try to get help, or to talk to somebody else about it?</span> <span id="s516">It sounds as if you two were really just --</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: How did you help Norman with his feelings about [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: We survivors.</span> <span id="s520">This is why we kept -- we were very comfortable only with survivors.</span> <span id="s521">They -- the Americans didn’t want us, we didn’t care for them, because they didn’t understand us, it was waste of time.</span> <span id="s522">Very superficial.</span> <span id="s523">We couldn’t get used to it, hi, how are you, and running, even not waiting for the answer.</span> <span id="s524">And I love you superficially, killed us.</span> <span id="s525">We were the most comfortable with survivors.</span> <span id="s526">As a matter of fact, when from Brooklyn we moved to New Jersey, I met a friend in the mountains, Viennese refugee, Edith Geller, happens we were in the same hotel.</span> <span id="s527">We befriended, we became like sisters.</span> <span id="s528">Very comfortable.</span> <span id="s529">I moved here.</span> <span id="s530">Only two families were of survivors, the rest all Americans, God knows how many generations, Jews, and non-Jews, they are the same.</span> <span id="s531">I moved here because I taught not far from here, so -- and I wanted also -- we wanted a community where everybody’s starts from beginning, not [indecipherable] anybody asks from where did you come.</span> <span id="s532">The --</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: Where’s here?</span> <span id="s534">Here is --</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: Springfield.</span> <span id="s536">Because they came from Newark, and Elizabeth, all over, so everybody was new, not only we.</span> <span id="s537">We started.</span> <span id="s538">But whom did we befriend?</span> <span id="s539">There was a pediatrician, a survivor.</span> <span id="s540">She was my age, again we were like sisters.</span> <span id="s541">We loved each other so much.</span> <span id="s542">She was only 39 when she died.</span> <span id="s543">She got cancer on the breasts, she had two little children.</span> <span id="s544">She just built up her practice, and it spread all over.</span> <span id="s545">On her dying bed, one in the morning, my -- her husband called me to come to the hospital.</span> <span id="s546">She was in a tent.</span> <span id="s547">She was in coma, but she was very restless.</span> <span id="s548">I came.</span> <span id="s549">I said, “It’s Manya.</span> <span id="s550">Everything okay.”</span> <span id="s551">She held my hand.</span> <span id="s552">She quiet down, and she died.</span> <span id="s553">But that -- you see, we have very intensive feeling, or we like, or we don’t care.</span> <span id="s554">We just don’t go for acquaintances, we don’t care.</span> <span id="s555">And there was another family that -- also survivors, Gershwin.</span> <span id="s556">From Mamil and from Wachau, we befriended.</span> <span id="s557">Later, we moved in more -- I think by -- we are now by eight survivors family.</span> <span id="s558">Some [indecipherable] out, but the closest relationship, w-we have.</span> <span id="s559">And also, we survivor, we get together.</span> <span id="s560">It’s like family.</span> <span id="s561">As a matter of fact, it was very hard on my child, because she wanted happier people.</span> <span id="s562">She was tired already.</span> <span id="s563">She didn’t know how to cope about killing, surviving, everybody sharing their experience.</span> <span id="s564">So she adopted other grandparents from my neighbor, who the grandparents were born already in the States.</span> <span id="s565">And they died now, they would be now a hundred years old, her best friends.</span> <span id="s566">And when she got married, I guess also the selection was she didn’t want the child of survivor.</span> <span id="s567">She met -- her husband is fifth generation American Jew.</span> <span id="s568">Family, family, she [indecipherable] Norman.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: When did you -- when did you start talking to her?</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: It -- unfortunately too early.</span> <span id="s571">Not I. My husband.</span> <span id="s572">I warned him.</span> <span id="s573">Okay, she ask question, naturally, why -- where are my grandparents?</span> <span id="s574">Every weekend grandparents coming, everybody showered with love, with toys, where are mine?</span> <span id="s575">So, I had to tell her.</span> <span id="s576">And it was hard for her to accept, poor child.</span> <span id="s577">And so the only relief was -- this is why we traveled so often to Israel, because there was my sister.</span> <span id="s578">No, she never met my grandmother, she was born after my grandmother died.</span> <span id="s579">But my sister and family.</span> <span id="s580">So when my sister’s children said, “Let’s go to grandma.”</span> <span id="s581">Because they had their grandmother on paternal side, who immigrated when my brother-in-law, in ’35, or ’34 to Israel.</span> <span id="s582">She said, “We don’t have any grandparents.</span> <span id="s583">Why do you say grandma?”</span> <span id="s584">So I had to explain her, she was a child, that there’s two parts, father and so.</span> <span id="s585">And we took her there to kindergarten, and we wanted her to get the real warmth from uncle, and -- and from cousins, and so she suffered very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: This is the end of tape one, side B, interview with Amalie Salsitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Amalie Salsitz.</span> <span id="s589">This is tape number two, side A. Now, I would like to go back -- or we ha -- actually just been in Israel so to speak, when you introduced your daughter to -- to the family.</span> <span id="s590">Could you speak a little bit more about what did you expect, what was your dream?</span> <span id="s591">Your family was Zionist, it was your dream to go there.</span> <span id="s592">What did you expect, and what did you see?</span> <span id="s593">What were the different -- what was different, the expectations, what -- in what shape was the country, how were survivors perceived, how did you feel?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: How the survivors were received, I don’t know, because I came from United States.</span> <span id="s595">I only know what I heard from some, and what I read in the press.</span> <span id="s596">And so I wouldn’t like discuss because it’s hearsay and people [indecipherable] from the press themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: But you as a survivor, how were you --</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: But it’s different, because I was from the United States, and I didn’t deprive the Israelis from their income, what they felt any newcomer does.</span> <span id="s599">It’s a big difference.</span> <span id="s600">And so I will not speak, because my family, naturally, was very happy.</span> <span id="s601">Why it was happy?</span> <span id="s602">Well, the reunu-ion was in ’49.</span> <span id="s603">We came with the tour to settle, this what was our aim, in Israel.</span> <span id="s604">We are happy, it’s finally a state, and finally we have someplace to go when they chase us out, not like n-no door was open for us, even you know, the big boat that they sent back, and not one, only how my uncle was saying, and he was on the Struma, and you know, Saint Louis, and all this.</span> <span id="s605">So finally, we felt we a nation, we have home.</span> <span id="s606">If God forbid one country decides to persecute the Jews -- I’m not talking already about genocide, but this a safe haven where Jews can run and go.</span> <span id="s607">Now, when we came in ’49, and we expressed our desire to settle, this was the time the country was very, very poor.</span> <span id="s608">And they didn’t have -- really each citizen, each took away from the other.</span> <span id="s609">So my uncle, especially the oldest brother of my mother, Max Gengar, childless, he said to me -- and he was quite well off, be -- he came there in 1922, he had -- 1919.</span> <span id="s610">Then ’22 he had to escape because he was kill -- an Arab wanted to kill him, he killed him, so he escaped to Germany, back to his brothers.</span> <span id="s611">He advised us, he said, “You are very young.”</span> <span id="s612">At that time, ’49, so I was 27, and my husband was 29.</span> <span id="s613">He said, “You young, you have to start your life.</span> <span id="s614">Why don’t you start it really, in United States, where the possibilities are better, and larger, and you will be able to help us out in Israel.”</span> <span id="s615">And this what we accepted, and I must say modestly, humbly, we have done it.</span> <span id="s616">My sister, who struggled terribly, we are able to send her children to a univer -- give education, because in Israel is only mandatory I think five or six grades, and then we are able to pay for their studies for high school.</span> <span id="s617">And naturally all s -- all the necessities.</span> <span id="s618">My sister lived on the farm with children, primitive.</span> <span id="s619">We bought -- I didn’t have at that time a Frigidaire, I had the icebox in Brooklyn, and a -- Frigidaire, she had two children, I sent a washing machine, just to help her out, because again, she came from such a very comforta -- [ringing]</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: The telephone.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: But we could let --</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: Do you want --</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: Yeah, we couldn’t -- I couldn’t have it.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: Okay, let -- let’s stop for a second.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: And I will take it off.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: Yes, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: Okay, continue.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: So -- so we decided this what we have done, and we were able to help with a wedding, with everything.</span> <span id="s630">And you know, if they were in [indecipherable] village, so they didn’t get any money.</span> <span id="s631">They needed a house, they needed to buy.</span> <span id="s632">We were able to help her.</span> <span id="s633">And especially 10 years we didn’t have any children, and I had a steady job as a teacher, and I got -- I was very well paid for the times.</span> <span id="s634">Norman was able, because of my salary later, to quit the job in the ink factory, and he went into peddling, on installment.</span> <span id="s635">He went to the Polish section, which was here in New Jersey, Jersey City.</span> <span id="s636">And he looks like a Pole, and they thought he is Polish, and Norman doesn’t wear a wedding band, probably you noticed, so he was single, on the market.</span> <span id="s637">Any woman who wanted, really, thought she has chances with him, this is Norman.</span> <span id="s638">So this is the story.</span> <span id="s639">So he got customers, and he started making money, and I with my teaching, we -- and then, he started very small items, then naturally he gained confidence from people, he was able -- lately he selled new -- to newlyweds, furnished them, everything.</span> <span id="s640">He [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s641">But then he had enough, and he switch, he decided now -- real estate, building development was flourishing, so he decided to switch into this field, but naturally he didn’t know anything about it, like he didn’t know about -- anything about furnishing people, too.</span> <span id="s642">So nights he went to school to learn to be a decorator, and here he -- being now he had the capital, so he took in a German -- an Italian builder.</span> <span id="s643">The builder didn’t have any money, but he taught him, and they worked together.</span> <span id="s644">So this how he learned.</span> <span id="s645">He started, and he flourished, he built.</span> <span id="s646">And it’s first few houses, then bigger, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: Before we go, we stay in the United States and -- and talk a lit-little bit more about your life, then I will have one more question with regard to Israel.</span> <span id="s648">Did you feel Jewish in a special way, in a different way than you had before entering the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: No comparison.</span> <span id="s650">Here I am among mine.</span> <span id="s651">I am not a minority.</span> <span id="s652">Do you n -- I -- no one who didn’t go through it doesn’t understand the feeling to be a minority, and be picked, always sacrificial lamb for anything goes wrong.</span> <span id="s653">Here I among -- I’m e-equal to others.</span> <span id="s654">And this such a wonderful feeling.</span> <span id="s655">I -- and so proud, and especially I was privileged to watch the development of this county since ’49.</span> <span id="s656">At least every two years we were there, from the very hard times, economically how the county built up, and physically from the desert how cities flourished and built up.</span> <span id="s657">And how people really, also, were able to live differently, and the culture.</span> <span id="s658">One thing is always very nice, high standard, how people were informed, well-read, and in the pleasure to discuss with them.</span> <span id="s659">And there’s a pride, pride to be among people equal -- intellectual people, very bright people.</span> <span id="s660">Even they are algart.</span> <span id="s661">But this is the thing, the characteristic of the Jews.</span> <span id="s662">And -- and pushy, because otherwise they wouldn’t survive.</span> <span id="s663">But you accept it, but you are proud what you see, what they achieved.</span> <span id="s664">And anybody tries to downtrod, even when the state was proclaimed, you know, the American wanted to actually is -- dissolve it, and to say Israel stop, you know, to exist, you know, because of the Arabs.</span> <span id="s665">And oil, do -- we surrounded with Arabs, always the danger.</span> <span id="s666">They wanted to throw, and still want to throw it to the sea.</span> <span id="s667">So there is a feeling -- I feel responsible.</span> <span id="s668">I remember when the Six Day War was, how I cried.</span> <span id="s669">I wanted to bring all the children, because of security.</span> <span id="s670">I was afraid, so many armies, what will happen?</span> <span id="s671">They will squash, they will kill.</span> <span id="s672">So I had wanted to save the children at least, but thank God, it was very successful.</span> <span id="s673">Then the Yom Kippur War, I lived through it, okay?</span> <span id="s674">I share the fate of the Israelis.</span> <span id="s675">Every election, every news.</span> <span id="s676">It’s very important to me, the security of the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: How do you feel then, and that is the last question, but it’s an important [indecipherable] how do you feel then about right now the situation, what with the peace negotiations, they -- the direction taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: I am not happy because I don’t trust.</span> <span id="s679">I believe what Arafat said, what he says to the Arabs.</span> <span id="s680">It’s a piecemeal.</span> <span id="s681">He wants part, whatever he can get it, without the war, then he will be strong, and he feels he -- he wants really, to erase this -- the state of Israel.</span> <span id="s682">He will do a favor, he will permit some Jews to stay, maybe.</span> <span id="s683">And this scares me, very much so.</span> <span id="s684">And the pressure from the world, in order to appease this oil, the Arab oil, the Saudi oil, the pressure they put on Israel to make concessions, when they know that the concessions endanger the security of the land, yes.</span> <span id="s685">I am very unhappy about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: Let’s go to America then, and let me ask you this.</span> <span id="s687">Do you remember -- not the moment, of course, but -- but sort of the time when you began to feel comfortable with your identity as Americans, and what did that mean to you, to be American?</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: Who doesn’t like to have a rich father, who doesn’t like to be from something very successful like United States?</span> <span id="s689">And not always I’m so proud, because I am still critical.</span> <span id="s690">I lo -- don’t like the bully.</span> <span id="s691">I am very unhappy now with the situation with Kosovo, not that [indecipherable] had to be stopped, but definitely not by bombs, not by breaking sovanti of a county.</span> <span id="s692">I don’t like it.</span> <span id="s693">And I’m afraid it may backfire, because now this is the biggest, strongest bully in the world, and if the Russians are pushed too hard -- they don’t have the means now, but they still have atom -- nuclear, and if they are pushed too much, and knowing the Russians, they will never forgive it -- United States, how it was treated.</span> <span id="s694">Now, with NATO, and entering s -- Yugoslavia, Serbs, and everything, I am afraid that may backfire.</span> <span id="s695">I learned history repeats himse -- itself.</span> <span id="s696">Look the Roman empire, Hellenistic empire, Britain, the big ones.</span> <span id="s697">They reach the peak, and then it goes down.</span> <span id="s698">I will not live to see, and I hope my children and grandchildren will not live, but unfortunately, this is how history is.</span> <span id="s699">And we shouldn’t pay for the mistakes we making.</span> <span id="s700">Hurts me that we Americans are not to like around the world, because we bully everybody.</span> <span id="s701">This hurts me, because really, it’s the only democracy, not the best, but is the best comparing to others, and the opportunities and the freedom, it gives everybody, according to abilities.</span> <span id="s702">The only thing really what a newcomer cannot be is a president.</span> <span id="s703">But take Kissinger, take others.</span> <span id="s704">If you’re just capable -- take us.</span> <span id="s705">After all, with no help from anybody, we are very comfortable.</span> <span id="s706">All the doors -- I must say almost all the doors were open to us.</span> <span id="s707">Okay, my was Jewish education, my husband was self-employed.</span> <span id="s708">No doors closed.</span> <span id="s709">I see my son-in-law, brilliant, he was accepted to Harvard, he is working, he is on staff of Harvard Hospital.</span> <span id="s710">My daughter is a lawyer.</span> <span id="s711">She could have been the biggest one if she wanted.</span> <span id="s712">The doors are open, according to your ability.</span> <span id="s713">It’s -- now they start little bit a quota, but it wasn’t a quo -- when I came was still the quota, Norman’s nephew was a quota, because then, when he wanted to go, I remember, he was accepted to -- to Columbia, and there was a quota, but no more.</span> <span id="s714">Now they start little bit, but it’s very high position, I am very proud again, how many Jews achieved very high positions now.</span> <span id="s715">They couldn’t before.</span> <span id="s716">And so I am proud that -- watching the progress.</span> <span id="s717">I’m proud that I am a country which is not controlled by the church, and this why I wi -- we selected to come here, not to Latin America.</span> <span id="s718">Why I mentioned la -- South America, because argen -- Argentina was my bro -- father’s brother, who immigrated from Stanislawow in ’28, and he was quite well off, established.</span> <span id="s719">Unfortunately, when I came to United States, a year later he died, age 45 on cancer of stomach.</span> <span id="s720">But he wanted to bring us over to Argentina, and I said, “Nevermore I go to a country, especially a Catholic country, and controlled by the church.”</span> <span id="s721">And thank God, here is the country, if I don’t like I can speak up.</span> <span id="s722">And if anybody tells me -- like, I had the neighbor here, German descendent, Mr. Spiegel, Charlie.</span> <span id="s723">And once our dogs had fight when I had the dog.</span> <span id="s724">He said, “You Jew, you go to Palestine.”</span> <span id="s725">And I said, “You German, go to Germany.”</span> <span id="s726">So everybody came from someplace, doesn’t matter if you was born here.</span> <span id="s727">The only really Americans are the Indians, so it’s a wonderful feeling.</span> <span id="s728">You’re not afraid to speak up.</span> <span id="s729">And if somebody insults you, you’re just free to fight back.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q: I have a few other questions, but it seems to be the moment to ask you -- we had talked about Amalie Petrenka in the beginning, who she was.</span> <span id="s731">We had talked about Felitsia Mewashefsky.</span> <span id="s732">Now we are talking who is Amalie Salsitz.</span> <span id="s733">Is that who you are then?</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s735">The only question I have to know, Amalie Salsitz, now presently a old woman, who retired, who lives just to -- for pleasant things, to -- as much as she can take out of life, or the Amalie who came, because of there’s a big difference.</span> <span id="s736">The one who arrived had to est -- had to establish herself.</span> <span id="s737">Without no help from anybody.</span> <span id="s738">So she had to be aggressive.</span> <span id="s739">She felt satify -- satisfied, accomplished, because in her profession she was very happy.</span> <span id="s740">As a mother having a daughter, a good daughter, the relationship was nice.</span> <span id="s741">There was some, like daughter mother missed, but straight in the time of the drugs, my daughter was not.</span> <span id="s742">She was in Boston, age 17, she graduated earlier.</span> <span id="s743">She became a lawyer.</span> <span id="s744">I’m happy, successful, and there’s respect.</span> <span id="s745">I am not a very active person.</span> <span id="s746">I love -- I’m a very private person, luckily, because Norman has to be at every organization, at every meeting, but not only to be a member -- a member, a paid member I am also.</span> <span id="s747">B’Nai Brith, Hadassah, Sisterhood.</span> <span id="s748">But I don’t -- I come very seldom, unless it’s something very important.</span> <span id="s749">Otherwise I prefer my privacy, my book I enjoy immensely, I lose myself.</span> <span id="s750">I like the privacy, also maybe -- maybe there’s the reaction to the war time, when I didn’t have a private corner where I could be myself, and I realized this is why I’m such need of privacy.</span> <span id="s751">Like so many, especially women, like to dine in the restaurants, and this is the biggest thing, go away for a weekend.</span> <span id="s752">I like my meals when I cook, not that I am such a good cook, and not that I love to cook.</span> <span id="s753">But I have my home.</span> <span id="s754">Because during the war again, I only had eat with the ration card, masquerading as a Gentile.</span> <span id="s755">In the restaurant, bring the potato in the restaurant, and I longed for a cook -- home-cooked meal.</span> <span id="s756">I remember when my landlady was making her soup, the aroma, the fragrance, and I ask, my goodness, will it be time when I will be able to make my own soup, my own tea?</span> <span id="s757">This probably shaped me.</span> <span id="s758">So till now, like I said, I like the privacy.</span> <span id="s759">I like people very much, but I’m as happy when I’m by myself.</span> <span id="s760">It’s not that I have to be beneath.</span> <span id="s761">Again, like Norman functions the best, he’s a ham when there’s a lot of people.</span> <span id="s762">When he doesn’t have a big group, at least four people listeners, he likes to sulk little bit, and sul -- and really y-you wouldn’t believe the joker, the storyteller than can be so quiet, that home you have to pry out from him a sentence.</span> <span id="s763">But most comedians are that way, I heard from other women too, that they’re so good when they entertain, but home they don’t open their mouth.</span> <span id="s764">So -- and -- but I am content.</span> <span id="s765">I love to be with my family.</span> <span id="s766">Naturally, with my daughter means the whole world to me.</span> <span id="s767">My grandsons.</span> <span id="s768">And even I have relationship from the beginning with my cousin Petrenka.</span> <span id="s769">He is now 70, and he’s a year and a half older than I am.</span> <span id="s770">As much as we can, we spend holidays together -- together.</span> <span id="s771">It’s harder to travel.</span> <span id="s772">And also with my friends still from home, I’m still in touch, whoever is alive.</span> <span id="s773">They moved now, many of them to Florida, because they’re old.</span> <span id="s774">Some are older.</span> <span id="s775">One -- one is 89, wa -- or 80.</span> <span id="s776">I have only my friend, to -- two that are my age.</span> <span id="s777">Mostly they were in the woods, they were married.</span> <span id="s778">But we in touch, and again, it’s like family.</span> <span id="s779">And on the phone, I -- I don’t like to call too much.</span> <span id="s780">I told -- I think I mentioned to you.</span> <span id="s781">I don’t have the patience to talk too much on the phone, but I will call to check how they are doing.</span> <span id="s782">I like celebrations.</span> <span id="s783">You know, at to -- attend when sp -- especially from family.</span> <span id="s784">It means a lot to me.</span> <span id="s785">Like se -- Thanksgiving, on my daughter, or my cousin Leo Petrenka’s daughter, she makes it, Joyce, in her house, means a lot to me.</span> <span id="s786">I don’t like big gatherings when the people are strange.</span> <span id="s787">Like my daughter ha -- Norman likes a lot of people.</span> <span id="s788">And when we go there for Passover, she has at least 32 people.</span> <span id="s789">So it means -- we are only by seven family, the rest are friends.</span> <span id="s790">I don’t mind close friends, 15 people, but the friends bring -- but she invites with their parents, total strangers.</span> <span id="s791">And I feel a celebration of holiday, I want with close people.</span> <span id="s792">So I stopped going, and I gave a ultimatum.</span> <span id="s793">All you make for family.</span> <span id="s794">I’d rather go to Joyce here in Long Island.</span> <span id="s795">I don’t want to come holiday and meet a lot of strange people.</span> <span id="s796">And this is how to celebrate.</span> <span id="s797">But remarkably, and astonishly, I read in the Jewlson Post that the survivors as in Israel, was an article complain about the same thing.</span> <span id="s798">When they go to celebrate family with family, there is no family, because so many, and they are not too com -- not comfortable, but not so happy.</span> <span id="s799">They want the warmth.</span> <span id="s800">We are missing, lacking the warmth, family warmth.</span> <span id="s801">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Q: I would just like to say in between, that we are getting a little bit wind against the microphone, but Amalie needs the -- the air coming through the window to -- to keep speaking, and to be comfortable, so we’ll just stay here, and now and then this little funny sound is simply the wind through the window.</span> <span id="s803">And it’s very hot.</span> <span id="s804">I just want our listeners to know that.</span> <span id="s805">And I do have -- I interrupted you.</span> <span id="s806">Would you -- would you continue, or I have another question I will ask.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: Go ahead.</span> <span id="s808">And I covered it.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s810">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: So you heard I like to read very much.</span> <span id="s812">I like theater.</span> <span id="s813">Like, for example, S-Sunday we are going to see, The Gathering, with Theodore Bickel.</span> <span id="s814">It’s excellent.</span> <span id="s815">Few years ago, just few years, there was not a Broadway show.</span> <span id="s816">But only drama, or musical, I don’t go for comedy too much.</span> <span id="s817">On the way to [indecipherable] all this.</span> <span id="s818">I don’t go.</span> <span id="s819">I go for drama, or musical that we didn’t see.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: What kind of books do you like?</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: I like -- first of all are historical biographies, historical books.</span> <span id="s822">Biographies, there is not book on Holocaust that I didn’t read, although they say we shouldn’t do it, but I am like a drunkard who goes to the closet with the bottles.</span> <span id="s823">I have to read every one.</span> <span id="s824">And -- but I don’t care so much just novels.</span> <span id="s825">I do from time to time, but most of my books, I will show you, are historical.</span> <span id="s826">This how I learned about American history, because when I learned English, I was taught about the British English -- history, but not the American.</span> <span id="s827">So actually, I filled up the gap, not taking a course in college, but by reading historical biographies.</span> <span id="s828">And I like -- also I like very much gardening, and naturally I am exercise fan.</span> <span id="s829">I -- every day -- every day religiously, oh of -- regardless of weather, I walk for a half hour.</span> <span id="s830">By the way, my doctors now, my age, compliment me very much, because I’m not exactly a healthy person.</span> <span id="s831">Blood pressure, and -- and I have a high cholesterol, and I have an enlarged heart, and I have all -- that is set.</span> <span id="s832">If not that I walk every day, I wouldn’t be alive.</span> <span id="s833">My arteries would be clogged, and also my density of bone is not so bad for the age.</span> <span id="s834">It is naturally -- I have osteoporize, because anyone in the age, but according to my age, it’s not bad, because of the walk.</span> <span id="s835">I like to exercise, I like to walk, but most important, I must have a lot of fresh air.</span> <span id="s836">I cannot be cooped up, I’m like a fish without water.</span> <span id="s837">Even in wintertime.</span> <span id="s838">I got [indecipherable] I fall, it’s slippery, but I walk.</span> <span id="s839">You see, I cannot be in close p-place, like we wa -- we -- we like to go -- we go for cruises, but I had to cut out, because it’s not properly ventilated, and I come home with infection in my bronchial tubes.</span> <span id="s840">So the price is too high.</span> <span id="s841">So I always have a open window, even in wintertime, next to my bed, then I can breathe.</span> <span id="s842">But I help myself.</span> <span id="s843">.</span> <span id="s844">And like any woman in the golden age, I don’t complain, I get up.</span> <span id="s845">And still I live longer than my mother, 41.</span> <span id="s846">I always look like this.</span> <span id="s847">And my father, my sister 17.</span> <span id="s848">So, after the war, every year was given to me.</span> <span id="s849">Every birthday, I appreciate it.</span> <span id="s850">Because -- and how long for a survivor, where I starved, where I got boils, because after the war, I didn’t have cultume enough, and everything.</span> <span id="s851">I don’t complain.</span> <span id="s852">I’m functioning well.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">Q: And you still speak out, too, and I have a question about that.</span> <span id="s854">You have written books, and we’ll talk about that a little bit more, too.</span> <span id="s855">You have spoken out a lot, and in public -- in schools, I believe, too.</span> <span id="s856">Is it difficult sometimes, because in a sense it keeps the wound open all the time, or is that necessary to -- to keep healing, to --</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: It’s both.</span> <span id="s858">It’s both.</span> <span id="s859">We have the obligation to talk, like I mentioned.</span> <span id="s860">With high blood pressure -- if you’re really curious, I’ll measure, if I don’t have now 200 and so.</span> <span id="s861">Costs me a lot, you know, health-wise.</span> <span id="s862">I reduced it, yes.</span> <span id="s863">I don’t accept.</span> <span id="s864">Norman still goes.</span> <span id="s865">I compliment -- I congratulate him, I admire him for this.</span> <span id="s866">He speaks.</span> <span id="s867">It takes too much out of me.</span> <span id="s868">As -- now I decline many, because unless it’s important like something for Holocaust Museum to commentary.</span> <span id="s869">Or when we had last year one of the drive for the pennies for the Righteous People.</span> <span id="s870">There were so many interviews, any channel on television, CNN, amen 33, CNN, eight, 13, 12, whatever you want, 11, all was.</span> <span id="s871">I had to.</span> <span id="s872">But also, before was so many.</span> <span id="s873">F -- lem -- all organizations, I felt I had to.</span> <span id="s874">But now, like for example, they wanted us to come out to Louisville, Kentucky, we declined.</span> <span id="s875">I don’t know if Norman told you, we got letters, because the teacher made them read our book.</span> <span id="s876">As much as tha -- they read only the part about Norman, they divided, and then they ask, and the letters were beautiful, but we couldn’t go.</span> <span id="s877">We invited, February the 29th, from Georgetown University, to speak about Holocaust.</span> <span id="s878">It’s a big if.</span> <span id="s879">I don’t know if I will be able to go, health wise.</span> <span id="s880">So, but still we have to do it.</span> <span id="s881">We have to do so long we can bear witness, and give testimony, because we always going on, even Germany built a monument, and acknowledged.</span> <span id="s882">The deniers are still -- try to deny it.</span> <span id="s883">And we are dead an -- in another five years, even the children survivors will be gone -- another 10 years, the children survivors, I’m talking, who are now 68.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: What do you think will happen to the memory of the Holocaust when the survivors are gone?</span> <span id="s885">What -- do you think there has been already in -- what is the impact of survivor’s testimonies already, on the collective Holocaust memory, and what will happen when they’re gone, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s886">A: I had to tell you the tru -- you just go by proof.</span> <span id="s887">Norman published a book to Syracuse University.</span> <span id="s888">They sent him his -- their catalog.</span> <span id="s889">On the new books, I think it’s new books they published, I’m not sure, but I think by 10, half are on Holocaust, 50 years after.</span> <span id="s890">As a matter of fact, people, because they can cope better with this now, are really doing more.</span> <span id="s891">Shows -- now, the gathering I had, it was supposed to be sh -- played only till the 18th of July.</span> <span id="s892">By popular demand they had to prolong it.</span> <span id="s893">Speeches, lectures, and specially I will tell you, Schindler’s List, by Spielberg, helped a lot.</span> <span id="s894">Also, The Holocaust, by what is his name?</span> <span id="s895">I forgot his name -- helped the awareness of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Q: You mean this -- this late 70’s movies [indecipherable] on NBC.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">A: Yeah, what is his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s898">Q: I don’t re-remember who did it, but I just remember --</span></p> <p><span id="s899">A: Wait, it’ll come to me.</span> <span id="s900">And Spielberg’s, helped a lot, too.</span> <span id="s901">Even -- even the comedy, which really never ta -- anybody thought that you can write about Holocaust in a comedy form.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Q: Life is Beautiful?</span></p> <p><span id="s903">A: Life is Beautiful, still brought the awareness.</span> <span id="s904">It’s not facts, it’s dis -- but it still -- that was something so cruel.</span> <span id="s905">His reaction with the boy being in the camp.</span> <span id="s906">At least, in any form, they try now, and they’re very successful.</span> <span id="s907">It’s very accept -- very, very successful.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q: So you think those -- those popular expressions, or representations of the Holocaust are very important?</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: Oh, very important, because we don’t forget -- the world to forget the -- now it’s the second generation what took upon themselves to do it.</span> <span id="s910">Not exactly my daughter, but many children of survivors, who continue.</span> <span id="s911">And their children, probably.</span> <span id="s912">You see, with us Jews, we never forget the goodness done to us, and we never ga -- forget the wickedness.</span> <span id="s913">We still celebrate Purim, which is remembrance of Hamen, who was han -- was hanged.</span> <span id="s914">We never forget the one thing physician, and we -- the c -- th-the crusaders.</span> <span id="s915">We’ll never forget it.</span> <span id="s916">Not I personally, I will not be there.</span> <span id="s917">I’m talking about the future generations.</span> <span id="s918">Such cruelty, no.</span> <span id="s919">You know, every Passover now, we say a special prayer now, included in ours when we recite the Haggadah, which is the book that we read on Passover about the camps, the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s920">We have services on our -- at home in the Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s921">And this will go for generations.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Q: This concludes tape two, side A, interview with Amalie Salsitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Amalie Salsitz.</span> <span id="s925">This is tape number two, side B. And you wanted to move -- add something to what we were saying.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: Yeah, I wanted to elaborate.</span> <span id="s927">Like I mentioned before, we Jews remember our benefactors, and remember our killers.</span> <span id="s928">Now we -- ma -- Norman was in touch with a Polish woman, Stashka, who was helpful.</span> <span id="s929">She didn’t save him -- his life, but she was helpful, and in the way -- some ways, endangered her life, because for harboring a Jew, or helping a Jew -- not helping, but harboring a Jew, she could be -- have been killed together with the -- Norman.</span> <span id="s930">And the other woman, who took me in, my f-father’s partner’s wife.</span> <span id="s931">I search for her, but I had the wrong address, I couldn’t find her.</span> <span id="s932">Till finally, 11 years ago, a friend of Norman, a Pole, located her.</span> <span id="s933">So we sent invitation -- at that time she was already 76 years old, and we invited both of them to United States as our guests.</span> <span id="s934">They were here for three weeks.</span> <span id="s935">They were honored, they got -- we live in Springfield, they got, from the city hall, they got the key of the city.</span> <span id="s936">They were invited to -- they gave testimony, and for Yale, whitesafe, they ga -- they were invited to ADL.</span> <span id="s937">They -- we spoke there.</span> <span id="s938">The Polish consulate was there.</span> <span id="s939">We have even the tapes from there.</span> <span id="s940">And naturally we took them sightseeing, and they met my daughter, and nis -- to old -- Mrs. Eezhaniecekov, the older one who helped me, said to me, “You stayed in my house three weeks, I stayed in you, now we even.”</span> <span id="s941">I said, “No, we are not even.</span> <span id="s942">You harboring me endangered your life, and the life of your whole family by keeping me.</span> <span id="s943">I invite you, normal times, materially it didn’t matter, I have the facilities, and um -- I just hosted you as a friend, without any fear of repercussion.</span> <span id="s944">So we are not even.</span> <span id="s945">I still am in debt to you.”</span> <span id="s946">And then, also a -- I would like to tell that after the war, when we met and we got married, we got married under our real name, but not officially.</span> <span id="s947">We had the reception, people we didn’t know -- the only one that we knew, it was my boyfriend -- my late boyfriend’s sister Sasha.</span> <span id="s948">The rest we didn’t know the people, big officials, and big -- in our apartment.</span> <span id="s949">So Norman and I, we promised ourselves, if we will live to age to be able to celebrate the 50th anniversary, we may -- will make it like a wedding, and thank God we able to fulfill our dream, our wish, and four years ago, I made -- we made a big -- for 120 people, a reception.</span> <span id="s950">Like a wedding, except that the -- we didn’t exchange the vows, the -- and my sister came from Israel, Babka.</span> <span id="s951">My cousin, first cousin from Argentina came with her husband.</span> <span id="s952">My cousin from Toronto, Canada came.</span> <span id="s953">My family from Chicago, from Dallas.</span> <span id="s954">Not -- not only my daughter from Boston with the family.</span> <span id="s955">And from Washington, from all over.</span> <span id="s956">This meant so much for me.</span> <span id="s957">The warmth, the firs time.</span> <span id="s958">And the speeches were just beautiful.</span> <span id="s959">Again, I missed my sister.</span> <span id="s960">My parents I understood, they wouldn’t have lived, normally, to be able to participate in our party.</span> <span id="s961">But my sister was only 17.</span> <span id="s962">She would have been 72 years old.</span> <span id="s963">She probably would have been a grandmother.</span> <span id="s964">And I missed her, and her family that she never had.</span> <span id="s965">But it was a very big affair, and I was -- it -- and also the survivor’s friends, came, who ard.</span> <span id="s966">So at least there was a celebration.</span> <span id="s967">But like any other celebration -- on my daughter’s wedding, too, was a -- being she’s a only child, it was done in Short Hills, which i-is here in New Jersey, exquisite place, beautiful.</span> <span id="s968">But when I walked to the aisle with my husband, I didn’t have tears from joy, only missing my parents, who couldn’t be at the wedding.</span> <span id="s969">So, on every happy occasion, there’s this sadness, that lo -- that -- the loss of the dear ones.</span> <span id="s970">Naturally, also, my sister came from Israel with her late husband, but still, the other sister wasn’t -- the -- that she could have been -- at that time my parents could be still alive.</span> <span id="s971">So no celebration ha -- is -- it sure is supposed to be a hundred percent happy, it’s never.</span> <span id="s972">Also, because outwardly, we live a normal life.</span> <span id="s973">I can’t complain.</span> <span id="s974">We were quite successful in the United States in many respects.</span> <span id="s975">Acknowledged, respected in our community, in our Temple.</span> <span id="s976">We publish a lot, we known people.</span> <span id="s977">Say as much as we can, we quite charitable, we known.</span> <span id="s978">But during the night, where we cannot control our thoughts, the dreams are still terrible.</span> <span id="s979">We are still chased, are still killed, and we caught.</span> <span id="s980">And this is when one awakes the other.</span> <span id="s981">One spouse -- or my husband e -- or I -- my husband.</span> <span id="s982">Because we screaming still.</span> <span id="s983">But I guess this will be till the day till we die.</span> <span id="s984">People thought we -- we thought that with time there wouldn’t be bleeding so much, but it’s not true.</span> <span id="s985">It was with us.</span> <span id="s986">So we will ask, can we ever forgive, and forget.</span> <span id="s987">And I tell, I cannot forget.</span> <span id="s988">I don’t have any right to forgive, because the victims are not there to forgive.</span> <span id="s989">I’m still alive, but they are not there, so I don’t have the right to forgive.</span> <span id="s990">People ask me if I’m religious, if I believe in God.</span> <span id="s991">I say, I observe, I’m not so religious.</span> <span id="s992">Iv -- but I believe in God.</span> <span id="s993">I cannot prove that there is not a God.</span> <span id="s994">In moments of distress, I will still turn to God.</span> <span id="s995">But I cannot say that I love Him.</span> <span id="s996">I cannot say that I hate Him, but I don’t love Him.</span> <span id="s997">I still questioning, where was He, that He permitted such atrocities.</span> <span id="s998">If I found peace, no.</span> <span id="s999">I cannot.</span> <span id="s1000">Not because nor -- I -- I can sed -- I can generalize, in United States, we didn’t get any help how to cope.</span> <span id="s1001">First we were immersed in life, to establish us, as we are busy.</span> <span id="s1002">So the days were easier.</span> <span id="s1003">But in -- older we get, and now when we -- I am retired, my husband’s semi-retired, it’s still so fresh, and so painful.</span> <span id="s1004">And we try to reason, doesn’t work.</span> <span id="s1005">And also by association.</span> <span id="s1006">We traveled extensively, except I must -- I shouldn’t brag, except India, and South Africa, we were all over the world.</span> <span id="s1007">When I saw in schools children led by teacher, I didn’t see Jewish children led by teacher.</span> <span id="s1008">I saw that the children left to the Umshlaktplatz.</span> <span id="s1009">Dr. Kolchuk’s children.</span> <span id="s1010">There were times in the beginning, not now any more, when I was in a place with a lot of people, especially when there was commemoration of the Holocaust, few thousand people.</span> <span id="s1011">I was always afraid to -- that there will be --a bomb will be thrown in, or fire, because I remember some of my friend’s family were put in the synagogue, and let -- and burned to -- the synagogue, bur -- and burn in the synagogue.</span> <span id="s1012">I was afraid of gatherings.</span> <span id="s1013">And many times when I see -- when I saw a dogcatcher, I associated it with the chasings, and catching the Jews, hunting for them.</span> <span id="s1014">I remember my neighbor had a lot of cats, so the see -- SPS called her, told her to put cages.</span> <span id="s1015">And when I saw it, I started to cry, I said, “Open it, I cannot see it.”</span> <span id="s1016">Because when I -- me -- I -- we -- we caught.</span> <span id="s1017">Till now, when I see cattle cars, picture [indecipherable] how my dear one were caught in it.</span> <span id="s1018">See my mother was not sent to concentration camp, nor my father, we didn’t have any in my town, Stanislawow, when we were under -- because we were under the Russians.</span> <span id="s1019">The Germans had excuse for the war that we are all Communists.</span> <span id="s1020">And they just killed us in ditches, the -- dug in the ghetto, on Jewish cemetery, we saw it.</span> <span id="s1021">One different excuse, different, supposedly reason, every time.</span> <span id="s1022">So you see, this -- you cannot erase something like this.</span> <span id="s1023">It stays with you.</span> <span id="s1024">And the same thing with food, when I give, till now I cannot face food, because I remember the times we starved, and moi -- my poor daughter said -- she was quite chubby one ch-child, because she said, “You always reminded me how we -- you starved, and the children in ghetto starved, and you always make me eat,” which is true.</span> <span id="s1025">I cannot, because -- so there are many things that shaped me, remained with me.</span> <span id="s1026">Again, Imelda has a lot of shoes.</span> <span id="s1027">I stuff too.</span> <span id="s1028">Not as many as she has, and clothes.</span> <span id="s1029">In case I cannot buy because I didn’t have, and the same with food.</span> <span id="s1030">And my daughter with food also.</span> <span id="s1031">She’ll buy a lot she doesn’t eat.</span> <span id="s1032">God forbid that something should happen, her children shouldn’t have food.</span> <span id="s1033">So certain things remained with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">Q: Are there certain -- which are your favorite holidays, and which don’t you celebrate any more, because they have memories, that you can’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">A: I always like Passover, Easter, always.</span> <span id="s1036">High holidays I celebrate, but it’s hard for me, because there’s a lot of prayers for dead, for killing, and very hard, but I do.</span> <span id="s1037">But then again I recall how it was home, how I used to come to my mother, because we girls didn’t attend synagogue like it -- Christians, or an American girls go.</span> <span id="s1038">We used to bring just perfume, because we used to feast -- no fast, not feast, not to eat, so naturally, salts, and [indecipherable] to revive.</span> <span id="s1039">I -- so I remember it vividly.</span> <span id="s1040">So it’s hard, it’s hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">Q: Let’s maybe talk about something that is more joyful for the moment, and that’s the family of your -- your daughter.</span> <span id="s1042">You had difficulties understanding sometimes, but she -- she is a successful professional --</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">A: Very.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">Q: -- she has three boys.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">A: Well, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">Q: Talk a little bit more about [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">A: You see with my daughter is only really -- she is not -- never was the girl who liked to laugh, like other, to giggle, they happy, because of us.</span> <span id="s1048">Only child, with older parents than others.</span> <span id="s1049">I was 34 years old, Norman 37, were in this time -- not now, but at that time particular, women had really children 25, 24, young mothers.</span> <span id="s1050">I was older, and she was a good girl, she was obedient, she liked to, but inside, probably, she rebelled.</span> <span id="s1051">And because the only child, like she said, I smothered her with love.</span> <span id="s1052">So when she was 17, she wanted to -- she was accepted to college, because she graduated one year before, being she wanted to go graduate school, and she was a very good student, they experiment here in Springfield.</span> <span id="s1053">So I let her go, because I felt she needs to get away, to be on her own.</span> <span id="s1054">I was hurt when she decided to settle in Boston, because I’ve told her, “You’re our only child, I would like to watch you children, my grandchildren growing up.”</span> <span id="s1055">I’m -- I know -- after all, we are not such young parents to start off, we were by 60 something.</span> <span id="s1056">And I knew that it will be harder and harder.</span> <span id="s1057">“I will prefer it,” I said, “if you move closer by at least an hour drive if you don’t want to be next to us.</span> <span id="s1058">To be -- we should be able really, to be more with you.”</span> <span id="s1059">But she decided to go to Boston.</span> <span id="s1060">I was hurt, but it was her choice.</span> <span id="s1061">And really, it is the situation.</span> <span id="s1062">The older son Dustin, m-m-m -- I have so many beautiful memories about him, h-his talk and everything, because we -- we were able still to see him at least once a month.</span> <span id="s1063">And he adores Norman, because happens when he was born, his father was doing internship, so interns worked 37 hours in the hospital, so he hardly saw.</span> <span id="s1064">So every time it was my husband, whom he calls in Hebrew Saba.</span> <span id="s1065">Saba, Saba all the time, because he was used.</span> <span id="s1066">The middle one, we love him, but we’re not so close, and he’s not close to us.</span> <span id="s1067">The youngest one, same story.</span> <span id="s1068">What, we see them once in three months, once in two months, and also it’s not that my daughter tells them at least once a week, call them.</span> <span id="s1069">They actually call now more, once a month when we give them allowances, you know?</span> <span id="s1070">But not how we feel, how we are.</span> <span id="s1071">There’s not the closeness, which hurt me very much so.</span> <span id="s1072">Because this is the whole world.</span> <span id="s1073">My daughter was the whole world for me.</span> <span id="s1074">There was --every place we went, we took her along.</span> <span id="s1075">As a matter of fact, she liked to go so -- so much, that sometimes when there was a wedding, and she was not invited, I make believe I am sick so she can go with my husband, okay?</span> <span id="s1076">And it’s not so because of distance.</span> <span id="s1077">We are very candid to each other.</span> <span id="s1078">There’s respect, there is kind of love.</span> <span id="s1079">It is.</span> <span id="s1080">But it’s not the warmth that I expected.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">Q: Have you ever found that kind of warmth, and that kind of love that you really wanted then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">A: Was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">Q: Anybody?</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">A: To be honest, with my friend who died.</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">A: This Dr. Dubin.</span> <span id="s1087">Yes.</span> <span id="s1088">Then I had another friend, also survivor, she was about six years older than I am, also.</span> <span id="s1089">You see, when I have really friends, it’s not acquaintance.</span> <span id="s1090">It’s like sisters even more, because they went through what I went through.</span> <span id="s1091">There is so much understanding, openness, even candidly we can [indecipherable] our -- our hurts, our feelings, even our husband, our children, candid, straight.</span> <span id="s1092">Unfortunately both are deceased, thi -- I did find it.</span> <span id="s1093">It was such warm, beautiful relationship.</span> <span id="s1094">My daughter is like my husband, not demonstrative.</span> <span id="s1095">She is hurt now, that her two sons are not demonstrative, not warm, but she is the same way, now she admits.</span> <span id="s1096">And now she understands, being a mother, how it hurt me at that time.</span> <span id="s1097">But she’s trying.</span> <span id="s1098">She’s a decent human being, I’m proud of her.</span> <span id="s1099">Like she didn’t want to be a criminal lawyer, because she cannot defend people who are guilty.</span> <span id="s1100">I’m proud.</span> <span id="s1101">You know, this ap -- attitude to life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">Q: When you just said she doesn’t want to defend people who are guilty, it reminded me of the question that I wanted to ask you.</span> <span id="s1103">Did you ever testify?</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">A: Oh yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">Q: You had seen so many things.</span> <span id="s1106">You did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">A: I was called in 1963 or four, to come to Minsta, and testify against the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s1108">Hans Krieger, who was the chef of Gestapo for -- in my town Stanislawow, and am -- Brand, and then Doust.</span> <span id="s1109">As a matter of fact, I witnesses willful killing by Doust.</span> <span id="s1110">But something happened to me.</span> <span id="s1111">When I was called the first time, I went by myself.</span> <span id="s1112">The second time they called me during the vacation, I didn’t have with whom to leave my daughter, I took her along.</span> <span id="s1113">Then -- but each time I got notification from the German consulate, they arranged the tickets, everything.</span> <span id="s1114">When there was suppear -- supposed to be the judgment of Doust, willful killing, I was surprised.</span> <span id="s1115">I got just a phone call, no tickets, that I have to come to the tr -- to the verdict of the trial.</span> <span id="s1116">I didn’t like it, because usually it was accompanied by the ticket.</span> <span id="s1117">I found it fishy.</span> <span id="s1118">I called up the German consulate, they didn’t know anything about it.</span> <span id="s1119">Luckily, luckily, in my cen -- how you call it, 10 cents or something, that I checked.</span> <span id="s1120">They didn’t know anything about it.</span> <span id="s1121">Naturally, I didn’t go.</span> <span id="s1122">And I didn’t hear anything, why I didn’t come, nothing, and no tickets.</span> <span id="s1123">Luckily.</span> <span id="s1124">Then, I was asked to come to Vienna, to testify against two brothers, Mauer, Willie and Hans, who were really very cold.</span> <span id="s1125">But one of them, the older one, wenald was killing in ghetto aktion action.</span> <span id="s1126">He knew me because I had to work as a chambermaid in apartment downstairs by this Doust, and he saw -- know -- knew me by sight.</span> <span id="s1127">In this particular case he saved my life.</span> <span id="s1128">He pushed me inside, not I should be taken into transport.</span> <span id="s1129">And then, also, I was able to save my father, the whole family, because I told this my father, later, after, they believe, because my father was very young looking, I saved him.</span> <span id="s1130">So when I had to testify, and he recognized me by my eyes.</span> <span id="s1131">Somehow he said, you know, gestap -- es -- no German, especially SS off -- were not supposed to have any -- anything to do with Jewesses.</span> <span id="s1132">Luckily, majority didn’t do it, they were afraid.</span> <span id="s1133">But somehow he was intrigued.</span> <span id="s1134">I told you I had the dark eyes, but my eyes -- and he recognized me, because when there was the killings, when we went to the ghetto, they discharge all the chambermaids.</span> <span id="s1135">We can work as slave labors, but not in their private homes.</span> <span id="s1136">He recognized me.</span> <span id="s1137">So I felt, if I go to testify -- I really didn’t know what decision to make.</span> <span id="s1138">If he still recognized the eyes, and he said, “Look, here I saved this Jewess, and how she’s paying my back.”</span> <span id="s1139">I felt my duty is to testify, but I couldn’t bring myself to do it, because I didn’t.</span> <span id="s1140">I didn’t go.</span> <span id="s1141">Till now I’m bothered, because he killed so many.</span> <span id="s1142">After he saved me and my family, I witnessed the killing of my neighbor.</span> <span id="s1143">She was walking on Umshlaktplatz.</span> <span id="s1144">From behind, she was walking, he shot her.</span> <span id="s1145">Just for pleasure.</span> <span id="s1146">It was not that he was ordered, it was not that it was the aktion, where they used.</span> <span id="s1147">But I couldn’t bring myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">Q: So you didn’t want him to -- to -- to say you betrayed him, when he in fact saved your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">A: He would feel I betrayed him, the Jewess, you know how it is.</span> <span id="s1150">If this would be puzzle, that he would blame me, I wouldn’t care.</span> <span id="s1151">This is the point.</span> <span id="s1152">Because in his theory, Jews are vermin, Jews are everything, look.</span> <span id="s1153">This is the reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">Q: I just want a quick follow up question to the Doust thing.</span> <span id="s1155">So what did you expect had happened with this notification that was not accompanied by a ticket?</span> <span id="s1156">What -- what did you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">A: There was a group of Nazis, [indecipherable] Nazis, who tried to get away with -- to -- to do away with witnesses to the trials.</span> <span id="s1158">And the -- because I heard later another case like this.</span> <span id="s1159">But when I checked the consulate, luckily, I said, “You invited me?”</span> <span id="s1160">They sent me a letter.</span> <span id="s1161">I said, “How comes you send me -- you didn’t send me the tickets?”</span> <span id="s1162">They checked, he said, “We didn’t send you a letter.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">Q: I forgot to ask you that.</span> <span id="s1164">I have -- actually just one more question left -- two.</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">A: Good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">Q: And one question is, how do you feel about the role of the Holocaust Museum?</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">A: I think it’s very important, because our people learned about it.</span> <span id="s1168">After all, statistically it’s proven.</span> <span id="s1169">So far they had 10 and a half, by now probably 11 millions people wi -- very small percentage Jews, the rest are non-Jews.</span> <span id="s1170">And Jew -- non-Jews, from the bible belt, from the west, that they never heard it, and never would know about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1171">It’s doing what it’s supposed to do.</span> <span id="s1172">I don’t know, like inclusion of other killings, but they’re not genocide, it’s a big difference.</span> <span id="s1173">This is a holocaust.</span> <span id="s1174">It’s terrible if you kill one person, but still you cannot compare it when you try to erase the whole -- whole people, whole race.</span> <span id="s1175">So I don’t like it.</span> <span id="s1176">But being -- I have to accept it.</span> <span id="s1177">It’s better something than nothing.</span> <span id="s1178">It’s underground, so if the government gave the -- so this is -- thank God we have also the Yad Vashem.</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">Q: And I also wanted to ask you if you think back -- I mean 50 years, and 55 years are a long time, but if you think back for just a minute, talk to me about one or two events in this country that were really important to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">A: In United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">Q: That made -- in the United States, that made an impression.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">A: Oh, now, wait a moment, important, impressions big difference.</span> <span id="s1183">Important was the birth of my daughter, see?</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">Q: Yeah, alri -- alright.</span> <span id="s1185">Let me re -- no, you’re right, let me rephrase this then.</span> <span id="s1186">An important cultural or political event, or a movement, the Civil Rights Movement.</span> <span id="s1187">Did that touch you in any way?</span> <span id="s1188">I don’t want to lead you now, I just want to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">A: Now, wait a moment, important again was when I became a citizen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">Q: There you go, that’s one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">A: Important, my daughter’s wedding.</span> <span id="s1192">Those are close to me.</span> <span id="s1193">Civil Rights, yes, I felt they should have.</span> <span id="s1194">I didn’t like the discrimination, and I’m glad the situation is improving.</span> <span id="s1195">Unfortunately they have their Farrakons, and if they could do, it’s not the majority, but you have -- but first there was not the majority in Germany either with Hitler.</span> <span id="s1196">This how it starts.</span> <span id="s1197">If they have the free -- if they would have the upper hand, I’m afraid, too.</span> <span id="s1198">But I still think I was happy.</span> <span id="s1199">I wouldn’t march for them.</span> <span id="s1200">But I was happy that the situation is improving.</span> <span id="s1201">I didn’t like what I heard, what the Americans had done to Indians, either.</span> <span id="s1202">I am -- I am for equal rights, I am for freedom, and for respect to everybody.</span> <span id="s1203">And it’s very important to teach everyone to respect, and to accept, because if we would teach, and succeed, we won’t have a holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">Q: I want to ask you that last question on another tape because we are nearing the end, but maybe just a brief one.</span> <span id="s1205">You have lived under Russian occupation.</span> <span id="s1206">How did you feel about the -- in the early 50’s when the -- the fear and the hatred really, of Communism was very great in this country?</span> <span id="s1207">Did you have a di -- slightly different opinion, or did you approve of what --</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">A: Yes, there should have been fear, because that’s what I witness -- I lived.</span> <span id="s1209">It was a big prison.</span> <span id="s1210">Imagine, they have their classification.</span> <span id="s1211">Everyone’s supposed to be equal.</span> <span id="s1212">No.</span> <span id="s1213">So you had to be a daughter of a -- a streetcleaner, to be -- become something, and God forbid if you are middle class again, the door was closed.</span> <span id="s1214">As a matter -- I had very bad experience, if not of my lat -- late sister Celia, who was so beautiful, we would have been sent to Siberia.</span> <span id="s1215">We got paragraph 11.</span> <span id="s1216">They were supposed to take away our a-apartment.</span> <span id="s1217">I wanted to study, and I wanted to become a doctor, they didn’t expe -- accept me.</span> <span id="s1218">So they only accepted me as a teacher because they were short on teachers.</span> <span id="s1219">But when they found out my background, even from this they expelled me, unless I pay tuition, which was more then if my father made in two months.</span> <span id="s1220">So where’s the equality.</span> <span id="s1221">Race too.</span> <span id="s1222">Unless -- when you a Jew, you were a Jew.</span> <span id="s1223">It was written in the kemkart yevari.</span> <span id="s1224">So not that we had the door open for us.</span> <span id="s1225">Actually, in my part, the Ukrainian got all the rights, he became the big one.</span> <span id="s1226">The Pole was the second.</span> <span id="s1227">It -- again on the third place was Ivray, the Jew.</span> <span id="s1228">And the fear.</span> <span id="s1229">I -- they blackmailed, for example, us students.</span> <span id="s1230">They had special department political spedsjust.</span> <span id="s1231">And they called us in, especially the one like middle class, that unless you denounce your friend, unless you find something, they make you a informer, blackmailer, and they blackmail you.</span> <span id="s1232">I was afraid to speak.</span> <span id="s1233">Only home, to parents.</span> <span id="s1234">And the fear that they will ship us to Siberia.</span> <span id="s1235">Then I thought it’s very bad, but lo behold, I didn’t know what is awaiting me when Hitler came, when the Germans occupied.</span> <span id="s1236">So at least this one, they let you live.</span> <span id="s1237">But here, our lives was in danger.</span> <span id="s1238">So I understood, they wanted to enslave people, robots.</span> <span id="s1239">And also, there was the machinery, the one who was a [indecipherable] Stalin, who lived like kings, and the people still didn’t have enough food.</span> <span id="s1240">They’re barely to live on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">Q: It’s a good place to stop.</span> <span id="s1242">This is the end of tape two, side B, interview with Amalie Salsitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">A: You want some more?</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">Q: -- view with Amalie Salsitz, this is tape number three, side A. My question, my next question is what do you think -- you may have said it, but maybe you can elaborate one more time on it, what do you think are the lessons?</span> <span id="s1246">Do you think there are lessons that can be drawn from the Holocaust, and has the world learned from them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">A: Yes, there are lessons that can be drawn from the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1248">What intolerance can do, what hatred can do, how destructive it is.</span> <span id="s1249">But, if the world learned something, I’m sorry to tell you not.</span> <span id="s1250">Otherwise, we wouldn’t have Rwanda, we wouldn’t have Cambodia, and we wouldn’t have other mass killings that I don’t know how to stop because there’s so many now o-occur in this world.</span> <span id="s1251">So there’s still deep hatred, still, and I don’t know -- trying -- we try, but the difference is, when the Armenians were killed by the Turks, the world stood by quietly, and it was not later -- there were not -- no -- no trials, and not too much really, in the press.</span> <span id="s1252">With the Holocaust --</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">Q: You mean the Kurds by the Turks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">A: No, no, no, Armenians.</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">Q: The Armen -- Armenians.</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">A: Armenians.</span> <span id="s1257">This is why Hitler felt that he can do it, because what’s to the byhear, when there was killing of people, and -- and here there were Christians ki -- Moslems killing Christians.</span> <span id="s1258">The church stood by, and everything.</span> <span id="s1259">So he thought he will have a free hand -- and he was right -- to do with the Jews.</span> <span id="s1260">But now with the Holocaust, because there was a trial.</span> <span id="s1261">It’s so much written and done about it to educate the people, I do hope -- I do hope that it will not occur.</span> <span id="s1262">At least our President Clinton cited as a reason to bomb, and to enter f-f-f -- for [indecipherable] country, because that the world stood by during the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1263">I don’t accept it, but still this was an excuse.</span> <span id="s1264">So let’s hope.</span> <span id="s1265">And the trials that they have now in Geneva, and ha -- Hague.</span> <span id="s1266">Maybe this will prevent.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">Q: But you don’t accept the argument, no?</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">Q: Why not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">A: The argument that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">Q: From Clinton, that Clinton made.</span> <span id="s1272">You said, “I don’t accept it.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">A: From -- because the truth is where was he in Rwanda, other countries?</span> <span id="s1274">And where is he with the Kurds in Turkey?</span> <span id="s1275">In s -- in Iraq, in Syria?</span> <span id="s1276">If so -- so why he had to step in?</span> <span id="s1277">This why I don’t accept it.</span> <span id="s1278">And also, the truth is, when one state broke away from Yugoslavia, one after another, why didn’t he do when the Croatians expelled the Serbs, and the killings?</span> <span id="s1279">Why he permitted this?</span> <span id="s1280">If so, I will take him seriously.</span> <span id="s1281">Had he acted the same way with the others.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">Q: Is there anything that you would like to say before we conclude this interview?</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">A: It’s very important, really, to keep it up in schools, and to teach and educate, because the children are the future of a nation.</span> <span id="s1284">And if you teach them, hopefully something will sink in that never again such cruelty will be perpetuated among another human being.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">Q: Thank you very much for the conversation with the interview.</span> <span id="s1286">This concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial interview with Amalie Salsitz.</span> <span id="s1287">Yeah, that’s the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">End of Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">Conclusion of Interview USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*00 PAGE 2</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">PAGE</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">PAGE 58</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054</span></p></body></html>
