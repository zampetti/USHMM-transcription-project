morning Miles.</span> <span id="s11">A: Good morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Q: It’s lovely to see you, finally.</span> <span id="s13">A: Good to see you.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q: Miles tell me, where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: I was born in Tomashev Rovelski, which is a small town in between Lublin and Lvov.</span> <span id="s16">Q: And when were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: In 1920.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: January?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: 20th?</span> <span id="s21">Yeah.</span> <span id="s22">Tell me something.</span> <span id="s23">I want -- I want to get some idea about your family, and about living in Poland bef -- before the war, but if I would ask you, what is your first memory, the most prominent memory you have of your childhood, what would come to your mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: Well, it’s growing up in a small town, you know, and what would come to my mind probably most, would be the fact that I was the youngest in the family, and my parents were Orthodox Jews, and my older siblings, my brothers and my sisters, were kind of paving the way for me, which, you know, getting our parents to accept certain things that normally they would not.</span> <span id="s25">So, in Yiddish they call it the mizinik, that means the -- the youngest.</span> <span id="s26">I was fortunate, and privileged as a result of this, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: So tell me, you -- you have a brother Shlomo.</span> <span id="s28">A: I had a brother Shlomo.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: You had a brother Shlomo, and he was -- he was -- A: He was --</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: -- the eldest?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: He wa -- he was the oldest.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: And when was he born, do you remember?</span> <span id="s33">A: 1904.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: 1904?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s37">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: And then I had a sister, Esther, she was born in 1906, and I had another sister, she was born in 1908, and that --</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: And that’s Peshe.</span> <span id="s40">A: Peshe.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: And then I have a brother who lives in Florida now, and he was born in 1910.</span> <span id="s43">Q: And what’s his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: Jonah.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: Jonah.</span> <span id="s46">And were all the siblings prior to your birth, moving away from Orthodoxy?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: Well, not all of them.</span> <span id="s48">My oldest sister Esther did not.</span> <span id="s49">But bear in mind that this was a period that the -- the coming out of -- of Jewish, young Jewish people, coming out of the O-Orthodox confines, you know, and embracing the culture and -- and the type of living that was, you know, in the process of developing.</span> <span id="s50">It was in the process of developing.</span> <span id="s51">So, it -- it is difficult to say what was the year that a break point came.</span> <span id="s52">It was more you have to deal with it, you know, in periods, in that case, perhaps.</span> <span id="s53">But it was an interesting period, it was a period where the transition from straight Orthodoxy, and you know, no questions asked, to you know, this is the Jewish law, and this is the custom, and this is what you do, came under scrutiny by young people.</span> <span id="s54">Young people wanted to embrace, you know, the customs and, you know, culture of the country, either that they lived in, or that was neighboring, you know, Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: And did -- did this distress your parents, from what you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: Yes, it did, because they felt that we are wandering off, and we will wind up in a different culture, an-and to them it was a very, very major problem, no question about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: Did this -- did this mean that there was a kind of internal argument, in -- in the -- in the household?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: It was not only internal, it was -- it was -- our -- our parents did not take kindly to the fact that, for instance, my brother, my oldest brother, you know, he was not kosher.</span> <span id="s59">This was unheard of in those days, you know.</span> <span id="s60">My older sister, Esther, she was perhaps a little more progressive than my parents, but religious, and following the rules and customs, you know, that she was raised -- she was brought up in.</span> <span id="s61">My younger sister was -- Peshe was desiring to make progress, but was not quite that courageous.</span> <span id="s62">But Jonah, he was the fighter.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s64">And were you -- were you modeling yourself off of [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: I was -- first of all, bear in mind that there was a difference between -- in my ye -- young -- my oldest -- my youngest sibling, and me, what there was a difference of 10 years.</span> <span id="s66">So, you know, it’s a substantial difference.</span> <span id="s67">And I was the baby in the family, and -- you know, and -- and that’s -- I pointed out to you the fact that I was the youngest, you know, everybody treated me with a little extra affection, and what have you.</span> <span id="s68">And I would say, when I look at it back, that my effort to embrace, you know, progress and, you know, and modern methods and -- and -- and stepping away from some of the Jewish laws was the most af -- most vivid.</span> <span id="s69">And my parents recognized it, and they tried, but they tried with me, not ano -- in the manner of laying down the law and no questions asked, but trying to persuade me, trying to do certain things, you know.</span> <span id="s70">But they realized that times are changing, and it will be a different world.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: Did you speak Polish and Yiddish in the house, or -- A: In the house, Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: With my colleagues, Polish and Yiddish.</span> <span id="s74">Q: And did your parents speak Polish as well?</span> <span id="s75">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: They did?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: So when you grew up, were you growing up in a very mixed atmosphere, or because your parents were Orthodox Jews, it was very enclosed within the Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: They were two processes of growing up.</span> <span id="s80">One was the growing up at home, and the other one is the growing up at outside.</span> <span id="s81">At home my parents were Orthodox Jews.</span> <span id="s82">My father was a -- a lieutenant of one of the famous rabbis of those days, the Belzai rabbi that you probably heard about it, you know, the Belzai rab -- the Belzai rabbi was one of the major, major, ra-rabbinic dynasties of those days, and my father was a lieutenant there.</span> <span id="s83">This was something very unusual.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: And what does that mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: He was very close to the -- the rabbi, and when he ki -- first of all, he supported him substantially.</span> <span id="s86">And when he came to Beltz, where the rabbi lived, is -- my father was called [indecipherable] Tomasheva, that was a big to-do.</span> <span id="s87">If the rabbi or his family, or his brother, who was the chief rabbi of Bilgori, which was a neighboring city, came to Tomashev, they stayed in our house.</span> <span id="s88">This is something extra, extra special.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: Mm.</span> <span id="s90">So your father was a prominent person?</span> <span id="s91">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: And mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: And mother.</span> <span id="s95">So tell me about him.</span> <span id="s96">What do you remember about your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: Well, first of all, you’ll have to bear in mind that we are dealing about a period where Jews were confined to their own cultural environment.</span> <span id="s98">And my father, for in-- to give you an example, was very friendly with the township judge.</span> <span id="s99">But being friendly with the township judge did not mean that the township judge invited my father for dinner, or my father invited the judge for dinner.</span> <span id="s100">But they were very, very friendly, you know, and th -- my father was very respected.</span> <span id="s101">As far as our material position in town, I would say we were considered one of the wealthiest people, and this had it’s impact also.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: And your father was as a -- a business person?</span> <span id="s103">He ran a --</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: My father, yes.</span> <span id="s105">My father concentrated on -- we -- we were millers.</span> <span id="s106">And some mills we owned, and some mills we leased and operated.</span> <span id="s107">But we were millers for generations, you know?</span> <span id="s108">And my mother was a very, very bright woman, very bright woman, very unusual woman, and she was running businesses on her own.</span> <span id="s109">She had a wholesale import, and -- an import business of tea, and coffee, and -- and spices, and you know -- it was a very large business.</span> <span id="s110">L-Large to an extent -- to give you it -- it’s -- it will sound funny.</span> <span id="s111">When salespeople came to town -- it’s going to be difficult to describe it for you in English, because in English the -- in Polish there is a difference between male and female when you refer to somebody.</span> <span id="s112">In English you don’t -- who is Joan Ringleheim, who is Miles Lerman?</span> <span id="s113">But in Polish is, this is -- you know, defined in masculine, and in -- in -- in -- in</span></p> <p><span id="s114">--</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: In feminine.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: In feminine.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: And salesmen used to come and ask who is this, but referring to it, you know, as a man, Jarket Lerman, you know.</span> <span id="s119">In other words, they couldn’t believe that a business of this magnitude, of this size, is run and operated by a woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: So how did that happen?</span> <span id="s121">It’s so unusual, it would seem to me, during that era.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: Yes, yeah, yes.</span> <span id="s123">You have to bear in mind that for women to be involved in -- in the p -- in -- in -- in the task of earning a living was not unusual in Poland, because you have to understand that going back not too many years, not too many decades, it was the nicest thing.</span> <span id="s124">The best thing that could happen to a man is to sit and study Torah, and his wife was the breadwinner.</span> <span id="s125">But the breadwinner, she had a little stall, you know, and was selling a herring, or you know, or some flour, or some sugar, you know, and scraped out a living.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: This is not what my mother did.</span> <span id="s128">My mother ran a very, very large business.</span> <span id="s129">And it was difficult for th -- [indecipherable] I told you, it was difficult for them to conceive that a woman is on this level.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: Did she come from a family where they were business people as well, is this what --</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: Well, y-yes, my grandfa -- I remember my grandfather on the ma -- on the maternal side, he was at -- he had a -- he was mun -- he was in charge, he had -- I was gonna call it a factory, it was not a factory, it was a plant, where they were making wooden shingles, because wooden shingles were used, you know, for roofs, and this was th -- it’s like having a -- a roofing business, you know.</span> <span id="s132">So, yes, they came from a business family, but not of the size, and not of the caliber that my mother developed.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: So the kids of the family, did they help in the milling business of your father?</span> <span id="s134">Didn’t you help more with your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: Depends.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: Depends.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: It depends.</span> <span id="s138">This was not the only business we had.</span> <span id="s139">We had a wholesale business of liquor, which is, you know, this -- this -- you needed special license for it.</span> <span id="s140">So, my brother, for instance, when he was in Tomashev, was in charge of the liquor business.</span> <span id="s141">My sister Peshe and her husband were in charge helping mother with her business.</span> <span id="s142">My older sister, Esther, and her second husband -- because she lost her husband at a very early age, were in charge of helping father with the mills.</span> <span id="s143">So everybody did something, you know, specifically, and mother and father were directing traffic, they were, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: And you?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: I -- I was in school.</span> <span id="s146">I was the youngest, you know, and my father died in 1938.</span> <span id="s147">Normal death, you know.</span> <span id="s148">When I say normal, it was not part of the Holocaust --</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: -- it was 1938.</span> <span id="s151">And I came home, and the family decided now because I wa -- I studied in Lvov, you know, so the family decided that mother is going to need help, and you know, and there will be a reshuffling of who will do what, and they decided that I need to interrupt my schooling and stay home, which I regret very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: So let me go back to when you were a kid.</span> <span id="s153">Were you a very spoiled kid?</span> <span id="s154">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s155">I was not very spoiled, but spoiled.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: Did you like school?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: I liked school, I was very good in school.</span> <span id="s158">I was not a very intensive studier, you know, but I had no trouble, I had good grades, and you know, I -- I’m a little bit of a devil.</span> <span id="s159">I was a little bit of a devil.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: I’m surprised.</span> <span id="s161">Was it a little bit difficult at home in some ways, being the youngest, because all your siblings were so much older?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: No, this was -- my being the youngest was a plus, because everybody felt that they -- you know, I’m the kid, the kid brother, and they need to be good to me, and they need to be good with me, and they need to play a role in, you know, in bringing me up, because bear in mind that mother is, you know, the impressive person she was in the world of business, she was an extremely religious woman.</span> <span id="s163">She bought a shaitel, you know what a shaitel is?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: The wig.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: Wig.</span> <span id="s168">And you know, the maids that we had, had to run a very, very tight, and kosher with -- there’s no question about it.</span> <span id="s169">Not only kosher, but a very, very carefully, you know, managed kosher home.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: So, in mother, as -- as busy as she was with her business, always -- the -- the -- there used to be a form of reading the Bible in a woman’s way, it’s what’s called atsana varanay.</span> <span id="s172">Let it -- it’s a Hebrew, say [indecipherable] let’s go out and see -- to -- to study.</span> <span id="s173">My mother, as busy as she was, always, you know, you could find her when she was sitting and studying, you know Jewish customs, Jewish ways, Jewish stories.</span> <span id="s174">I have very warm recollections about it, it’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: You were close to your mother.</span> <span id="s176">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: Were you closer than your -- with your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: No, I was closer with my mother, because my mother was home all the time, my father traveled a lot --</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: -- on account of the flour mills, because they were all over eastern Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: Did you all, brothers and sisters and husbands eat dinner together, or was this once a week, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: Those that were home, yes, th -- but on Shabbas predominantly, not in the middle of the week.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s184">So you would eat dinner with your mother, usually?</span> <span id="s185">A: Ah, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: And you had a cook in the house, [indecipherable] maid, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: Oh yes, we had a cook, and a maid, I mean th -- that -- my parents were very, very much wrapped up in --</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: -- in a -- large businesses.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: And what sort of cultural life was there in town?</span> <span id="s191">Were there movies?</span> <span id="s192">There was theater?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: Oh yes, yes.</span> <span id="s194">It was a small town, you know, but the -- you ask me whether there was a movie house, yes.</span> <span id="s195">Theaters used to come.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: You know, traveling theaters.</span> <span id="s198">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: But let me say this to you, it was a town where was in the process of reforming itself, and there were many, many young people, either my brother’s age, or my sister’s age, who really were carrying the ball to reshape the character of the community.</span> <span id="s200">There were Zionist organizations, there were sports clubs, you know.</span> <span id="s201">And all -- the -- if you ask me whether my father was in favor of my brother playing soccer, no.</span> <span id="s202">He would much rather have him sit and study, you know, the Bible, and what have you.</span> <span id="s203">But this was not the case, they were, you know, rebelling, rebelling in a -- in a gradual manner, but making their way into modern life.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: And was this happening all over Poland -- A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: -- as far as you understand -- A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: -- that this was a -- a big movement.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: It was more even than Poland, I would say that we are talking about a period -- because I keep saying to you that I don’t want -- don’t want to define it for days --</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: -- it was more a period of years, or decades.</span> <span id="s210">It was a period where Europe chain -- s-say it was described as the spring of Europe, you know, that there was modernization in every aspect.</span> <span id="s211">In the aspect of doing business, in the aspect of culture, in the aspect of study, and in the aspect of Jews making their place in the non-Jewish society.</span> <span id="s212">And bear in mind that this was a period when Jews were ghettoized, but not in the sense of ghetto from the Holocaust, ghettoized means that there were sections of town where Jews lived, you know.</span> <span id="s213">And I would say that the process -- for instance, to give you an example.</span> <span id="s214">In our entire town there were three -- three people that graduated high school and went on to college.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: I-It -- graduating high school was a high level of education.</span> <span id="s217">Predominantly it was public school, you know.</span> <span id="s218">So the progress came in this way, the -- politically, the -- the Jews started to assert themselves, to have representation in the house of -- in the parliament.</span> <span id="s219">Anti-Semitism was there, but anti-Semitism in a kind of segmented way.</span> <span id="s220">It -- it was not an anti-Semitism that was active every day of the year, but in the last few years before the war, it intensified substantially.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: So in your growing up, you were not feeling a great deal of anti-Semitism as a -- as a young boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: I -- I was feeling -- the fact that I was Jewish, you know, I was different than -- I -- I had some non-Jewish friends, but very few, very few.</span> <span id="s223">Most of my friends were Jewish, and we -- for instance, I’d mentioned to you sports clubs.</span> <span id="s224">We had a Harpoyle and a Macarbie, these were two s -- Jewish sports clubs.</span> <span id="s225">And sometimes we participated in -- in soccer games where there was a representation of our town, then they were from the Polish sports clubs, and from our clubs.</span> <span id="s226">But I always -- we always felt that we are Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: No matter what.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: We always felt that we are Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: When you had non-Jewish friends, did you discuss your differences, or was this simply not going to be a --</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: Well, no, we discussed it, but let me say this to you.</span> <span id="s231">We -- first of all, we kind of felt that we are intellectually superior to -- that -- you know, the object of study and working hard to learn more, was more, you know, in the province of Jewish life, because Jews always aimed for being more educated, because Jews felt that the only way, the only thing that will bring them into society is, you know, by being educated well, or being better educated.</span> <span id="s232">You know, for instance, for a Jew to be accepted to high school, he had to have much better grades, and had to be much better prepared than a non-Jew.</span> <span id="s233">So th -- are you asking me whether they were killing Jews every day?</span> <span id="s234">No.</span> <span id="s235">You know, we li --</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: Well but -- yeah -- no, go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: We lived in our town, we knew that we are different, we -- first of all, we knew that we are different, we had to be different because wi -- I couldn’t eat, you know, because my -- my -- my parents would know that I had dinner with my non-Jewish friend in their house, they would be heartbroken.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: Did you -- did you find that difficult, that you wanted to eat in the house of your friend because you liked them?</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: I wanted to be the same -- Q: The same, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: -- I did not like the fact that we were identified as them.</span> <span id="s241">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: I wanted to -- there to be us.</span> <span id="s243">And it was a gradual process.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s245">Did you -- when you had non-Jewish friends, were they good friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: I recall two that were good friends, good friends, and I am certain that inasmuch as they could have had problems of -- of us being friends, they were my friends.</span> <span id="s247">There were bullies that were looking for an opportunity to get a Jewish kid, you know, on the way home from school, and beat him up, or push him, or bully him and what have you.</span> <span id="s248">They would probably come to my help.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: Did you get trained in sort of -- what do you call it, not fighting -- A: Self defense?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: Self defense, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: Well, we had Jewish sports clubs, and bear in mind that this is what I’ve been trying to bring out to you, that I lived in a period where young people desired to leave the beta midrash, the yeshiva and to enter into modern schooling, you know, so in -- as a result of this, we felt that we need to do everything that modern life has.</span> <span id="s254">Be active in sports, be active in theater, be active in -- in debates, be active in -- in -- in discussions, and what have you.</span> <span id="s255">So, as a result of this, what I’m trying to bring out is that in the sports clubs, yes we studied self defense.</span> <span id="s256">You know, not karate or something like it, but first of all, we were educated.</span> <span id="s257">You know, our organizational leaders.</span> <span id="s258">Don’t let yourself, don’t -- don’t -- don’t accept the fact that you are less, lesser, or weaker, or -- and what have you.</span> <span id="s259">And then the immigration to Israel began when I grew up, and my brother, my youngest brother, Jonah --</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: Jonah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: -- who is here, after he served in the army, in the Polish army, because this was army in s -- serving in the army was by conscription.</span> <span id="s262">Right after he finished, he decided that he wants to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s263">And this for my parents was a big problem, because they went to the rabbe, and the rabbe said, “When the here will come, when the Messiah will come, we’ll all go to Israel.”</span> <span id="s264">You know, my -- for instance, there were people who suggested to my parents, you know, because as I mentioned to you, we were rather -- substantially, you know, comfortable, wealthy, that we should buy a large parcel of land, or a building in Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s265">So it was customary in those days, that the Jews didn’t do anything without sharing it with a rabbe -- not a rabbi, the rabbe.</span> <span id="s266">Do you know the distinction between one and the other?</span> <span id="s267">A rabbi --</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: How would you dis --</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: A rabbi -- a rabbi is a rabbi, a roof.</span> <span id="s270">A functionary in the community.</span> <span id="s271">The rabbe was the head of the dynasty, of the rabbinic dynasty, this, you know [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s272">So any major decision that Jews had to make, you know, like, you know, going abroad with, you know, with a major investment, usually my father, or whoever it would be, would go to the rabbe, and ask for a brucha, ask for a blessing, you know?</span> <span id="s273">And ask for his advice.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">And when my father came to the rabbe to tell him that Jonah wants to go to Israel, and there are friends that are advising our parents to invest a substantial amount of money in Israel -- in Palestine in those days, not Israel.</span> <span id="s275">So, the rabbe’s answer -- the rabbe’s answer was, when Messiah will come, we will all go to Israel.</span> <span id="s276">Right now we should stay here, and we should serve God in a -- in a pious manner.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: But in spite of that, your brother left in 1934?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: Yes, he was the strongest revolutionary in the family.</span> <span id="s279">Q: Was he?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: But that -- was that hard for you when he left?</span> <span id="s282">You were 14 years old.</span> <span id="s283">A: I missed him.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: I missed him very much.</span> <span id="s286">He was, you know, he was part of the aggressively, you know, aggressive group that were asserting themselves, to make their way into modern society, and to accepting new ways.</span> <span id="s287">And most of all, going to Palestine, and building a -- you know, a state.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: Did he also f -- do you think that he believed that anti-Semitism was only going to get worse, that he couldn’t live a life in [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: There ne -- there was no discussion about that.</span> <span id="s290">Everybody recognized it, including my parents, including people that -- my parents equals.</span> <span id="s291">We all recognized that anti-Semitism is escalating, and it’s going to get worse, and something needs to be done.</span> <span id="s292">But no one, no one, in his wildest dreams, has any idea what is coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s294">Did you think about going?</span> <span id="s295">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: To follow your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s298">Yes, as a matter of fact, I started in junior college, a Hebrew junior college in Lvov, and my aim was to go to the University of Jerusalem to continue studies.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: So when you gra -- you graduated high school, obviously -- A: It -- it -- well, bear in mind, it was the -- I had --</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: -- high school, but the -- the school that I am talking about was a junior college, a Hebrew junior college, which was a combination of the -- of the leedselm, you know what leedselm is?</span> <span id="s302">The le -- this is the last two years of high school, and college.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: So you left Hamishov -- A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: The last two years of high school -- A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: -- to go to Lvov?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: Right, right.</span> <span id="s307">And then came --</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: And so what year -- what year was --</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: -- ca -- and I came home in ’38 when my father died.</span> <span id="s310">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s311">So when did you leave to go to school?</span> <span id="s312">A: ’36.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: ’36.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: ’35 -- ’36.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s316">And where did you live in Lvov?</span> <span id="s317">Why Lvov anyway?</span> <span id="s318">A: Lvov was one of the largest cities.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: And it was a beautiful city, and my father’s sister lived in Lvov, and they were -- when I, you know, convinced them that I want to go to Lvov, and I want to study in Lvov, they came to realize that they are fighting a l -- a losing battle.</span> <span id="s321">They didn’t admit it, but they -- they realized it.</span> <span id="s322">So they figured at least let me be well educated, and you know, let’s pick the best of what is coming.</span> <span id="s323">And he had a sister in Lvov, so I lived with his sister, with an aunt of mine.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: So was this a -- a new awakening too, to be able to be in such a large city like that?</span> <span id="s325">A: Oh yes, it --</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: -- ma -- made a major impact on me.</span> <span id="s328">It was a cultural city, and it was a large city, and you know, in the youth, it was a wonderful youth.</span> <span id="s329">There were wonderful Jewish organizations, and I was -- I was very, very fortunate that I spent two years in [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: It contributed a lot to the shaping of me as a young man.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: Tell me a little bit about social relations between boys and girls, and -- and what was that like growing up, was there --</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: Again, I must repeat that this was a transitional period.</span> <span id="s334">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: And some of the people, you know, participated in it -- some of the young people, and some of the young people didn’t.</span> <span id="s336">But by and large, we were the avant-garde.</span> <span id="s337">For instance, I was a member of the Shamare Atsyere.</span> <span id="s338">Shamare Atsyere was a leftist, you know, very progressive organization, but intellectual.</span> <span id="s339">You know, they -- we -- hebr -- knowing Hebrew was a must, otherwise you couldn’t be a member of this organization.</span> <span id="s340">And they were to -- you know, my friends, boys and girls, you know, we -- whatever we were unable to do at home, you know, and I mean the lifestyle, and even the reading, you know, and what have you, it all took place in the organization, the organization shaped the youth, you know.</span> <span id="s341">And it was -- it was a small town, but a small town that had all the aspects of a developing community with -- in -- in -- in every manner.</span> <span id="s342">It -- it -- the -- to give you some silly examples, there were two cars in our community.</span> <span id="s343">Two cars that were privately owned.</span> <span id="s344">There were 30 telephones.</span> <span id="s345">30 telephones in the entire community.</span> <span id="s346">And - - but there were many very fine institutions.</span> <span id="s347">For instance, there was a -- a loan society that didn’t charge interest.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: Oh, loan.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: A loan society.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: To help people, you know, if they needed a transition from a difficult period.</span> <span id="s352">And this was a wonderful institution.</span> <span id="s353">There was a Jewish bank, you know, that it was more of a -- it was a bank, it -- it functioned as a bank, and it charged interest, but it was more a beneficial society, you know.</span> <span id="s354">And so there were all kinds of organizations in town.</span> <span id="s355">There were the -- you know, the typical divisions between the Betar, the Shabotinsky group, and Shamare Atsyere.</span> <span id="s356">You know, we were f -- yo -- the -- constantly fighting with one ano -- not physically fighting, but discussing, and you know, and trying to mobilize and get more of the young people into our organization than into the other -- it was a major issue, you know.</span> <span id="s357">Where the one was a Revisionist, you know, Betar, over the one [indecipherable] Shamare Atsyere, it was a haloots, you know.</span> <span id="s358">All the organizations.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: And when you would sit and argue, what would be the major portions of the argument?</span> <span id="s360">A: The major por -- is the ideology of -- you know, of how we should conquer Palestine, and should -- should it be -- the Shabotinsky was a -- you know, a fabulous orator, and he felt that, you know, the only way how to do it is by training Jewish youth to be physically able, and capable of handling weapons, and -- and what have you.</span> <span id="s361">And prepare like th -- fight like the rest of the world is fighting.</span> <span id="s362">The Zionist organizations felt that it was an intellectual process.</span> <span id="s363">We need to educate young people, you know, we need to take them away from the Hassidic ways and methods of living, and bring them in -- into modern -- into, you know, Jewish philosophical debate, Jewish, you know, readings, Jewish classics.</span> <span id="s364">Bear in mind that the Yiddish culture, the Yiddish [indecipherable] came to be within a period of, I would say 50 years, 60 years.</span> <span id="s365">You know, when you talk about Shalomar [indecipherable] Farin -- are -- these names mean anything to you?</span> <span id="s366">You know, these -- they all --</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: What’s the last name that you -- A: Mandolere Mochais Farin.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: That -- he was one of the early ones, even before Shalomar Lachin, you know.</span> <span id="s370">So it was - - it was a -- a transformation in the making.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: You know, and I was very fortunate that I lived in that time, because it was a very creative period.</span> <span id="s373">It -- you know, 50 years before that, there were no questions asked.</span> <span id="s374">A young man needed to go to the Yeshiva and sit, and study, and -- and be pious, and wear the same attire that, you know, Jews were wearing.</span> <span id="s375">Not us.</span> <span id="s376">You know, we were already -- we were rebelling, and -- and I’ll tell you a joke which will be reflective of this.</span> <span id="s377">Our way of demonstrating that we are progressive was, for instance, to walk around without hats, you know.</span> <span id="s378">Not to have a cover.</span> <span id="s379">But you never dared to do it in the presence of your father or your mother, because you would hurt them terribly.</span> <span id="s380">So I remember once walking with a friend of mine on the -- you know, on the -- on -- on the street, and neither one of us wore a hat, you know, because this was our way of expressing our rebellion.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">And suddenly his father came across, he didn’t expect him, and he saw him without a hat.</span> <span id="s382">So he says, “Why are you walking around without a hat, with a,” -- you know, “with a bare head?”</span> <span id="s383">So he said, “I’m hot.”</span> <span id="s384">So he says, “If you’re hot, why don’t you take off your pants?”</span> <span id="s385">But it was a transitional period, and many of the young people of our town got involved in Zionist organizations.</span> <span id="s386">Quite a few went to Palestine, including of my brother, you know.</span> <span id="s387">And some of them became very, very active in Jewish defense.</span> <span id="s388">Some of them became very active in Hagganah.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: Including of my brother.</span> <span id="s391">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: You know.</span> <span id="s393">And they were the ones that prepared Palestine to be able to accept the immigration of -- after -- after the war of -- you know, after the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: Without any question.</span> <span id="s395">I mean, we -- I would say that it was -- beginning with my brother’s generation, it was a constant transition from the old Hassidic, pious, you know, very restricted manner, that the progress was made on opening the windows, and letting in fresh air.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: So -- so there was sexual experimentation as well -- A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: -- which would have been somewhat different.</span> <span id="s398">A: Yes, yes it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: Do you think Jewish young women, as well as young boys, or was more so among the boys you had --</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: No, Jewish young women and boys, that -- well, le-le-let me say this -- this to you, if you are referring to promiscuity, you -- if you -- if you went with a girl steady, you didn’t want her to --</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: You didn’t want to have sex.</span> <span id="s402">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: You may have desired it, but you know, if she was going to be your steady, you wanted her to be pure.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: I see, and you -- I see.</span> <span id="s406">That’s interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: So the dating was more in school, with non-Jewish girls, and -- Q: So you --</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: -- no dates, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: But -- sexual experimentation -- A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: -- would be with non-Jewish girls?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: Right.</span> <span id="s412">Very, very seldom it happened with a Jewish girl.</span> <span id="s413">You know, th -- the -- these things were taken seriously, it -- again, it depends when we are talking about.</span> <span id="s414">Are we talking 1920, are we talking 1930?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: Well, 1920 you were a baby.</span> <span id="s416">A: I was a baby.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: So we’re talking the 30’s for you -- A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: -- not what --</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: There is no question about it that by the time I grew up, and I was, let’s say 15 - 16 years old, that our town, like many other towns were on a rapid path of transition.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: Of a certain kind of modernization?</span> <span id="s421">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: But it’s -- i-it’s -- there’s something t -- is painfully ironic about all of this, because here the world seems to be changing in some radical ways, opening up to a kind of modern world, and then there is this huge machine of death that comes in the midst of it.</span> <span id="s423">It’s so --</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: We didn’t expect this.</span> <span id="s425">Q: Of course not.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: No one --</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: -- no one expected it.</span> <span id="s429">Bear in mind that, you know, the -- the history was that Germany, in first World War, has occupied our -- the town where I lived.</span> <span id="s430">They -- they ran occupational force, but there was nothing, you know, that they would do to -- nothing.</span> <span id="s431">And another thing, the fighting -- the fighting took place on the front line.</span> <span id="s432">Once the front line moved 10 -- 10 kilometers, or 20 kilometers, that was the end of the fighting.</span> <span id="s433">So instead of having the Russian -- the Russian police, or Polish police -- you know, you had German police, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: No different.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: And -- but in 19 -- [indecipherable] let me say this to you, I mean, we all had radios, we ordered newspapers, and we knew that in 1933, when Hitler came to power, that terrible things are happening in -- in Germany.</span> <span id="s436">Terrible things are happening in Germany.</span> <span id="s437">In Poland, the Poles aped, you know, many of the things that were happening in Germany.</span> <span id="s438">They started implementing laws, which were outright anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s439">For instance, Jewish students that were in college, could not sit on the benches with the Poles, they had to be on the left side.</span> <span id="s440">And those who didn’t want to be on the left side, stood in the back.</span> <span id="s441">You know, there were constant fights for, you know, equal rights, and -- and what have you.</span> <span id="s442">Poland was in the process of becoming a very, very anti-Semitic country.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: Was -- did -- so there was a great deal of nationalism, and a great deal of fascism that was beginning to grow --</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: -- in Poland in a way that you hadn’t experienced before.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: It -- well, bear in mind that -- you know, that it -- the love for Jews was never there.</span> <span id="s447">You know, if -- for instance, if you are talking about Poland was occupied, as you know from history, by Russia, Germany, and Austria.</span> <span id="s448">Austria was the only -- the only area where they were liberal and progressive, and they treated the Jews very well, and gave them opportunity to enter schools, and study.</span> <span id="s449">The Russian occupation was very, very oppressive.</span> <span id="s450">You know, the -- in the [indecipherable] they were, you know.</span> <span id="s451">And the Germans not as much, but w -- the Germans that we remembered were not Germans that we were afraid of, but when you started seeing what Hitler is predicting, you know, and we read Mein Kampf, and we knew --</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: You did?</span> <span id="s453">You read it?</span> <span id="s454">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: You read it in Polish or in German?</span> <span id="s456">A: Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: In Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: And what did you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: It was frightening.</span> <span id="s461">We knew that terrible things are coming.</span> <span id="s462">Q: Did you actually read it from cover to cover?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: No, but you know, major excerpts -- Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: -- and what have you.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: So did you, in your groups -- A: Discuss.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: -- you discussed this?</span> <span id="s469">A: Absolutely, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: And -- and were there people who thought that there was going to be a war, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: Well, as far as war is concerned, yes we saw -- if -- it depends when.</span> <span id="s473">If you are talking, for instance in 1934 - 1935, Hitler started his expansionary programs, you know, and he entered -- in 1938 he entered Austria, and he occupied Czechoslovakia, and [indecipherable] you know, from the French.</span> <span id="s474">It -- it was all coming, and it was coming rapidly, and it was very scary.</span> <span id="s475">But you want to know something?</span> <span id="s476">You just don’t pick yourself up and go.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: It wasn’t that easy.</span> <span id="s479">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: In particular in those days.</span> <span id="s481">You know, some people, for instance, I met them after the war, and I asked them, did they went in Palestine?</span> <span id="s482">Why did you leave?</span> <span id="s483">He said, “We knew what was coming.</span> <span id="s484">We knew that we have to build an independent home for the,” -- you know, “for the -- the Jews.”</span> <span id="s485">But on the other hand, in many cases people were, let’s say, the only one, and they were parents, they were not well, and what have you.</span> <span id="s486">Picking yourself up and leaving, and uprooting yourself is a major issue.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s488">Even for a very wealthy family.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: Did your brother write and say get out of there?</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: My brother was pleading.</span> <span id="s494">First of all, he -- he was more sensitive to the fact what’s coming, because the German Jews started coming into Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: So he was more aware of it.</span> <span id="s497">There were Polish Jews that lived in Germany that were pushed over the border, in the boneshin --</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: -- for instance, you know there was a -- so for me to tell you that the onslaught of Nazism came unexpectedly, I don’t think I would be telling you actual conditions.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: It was coming in that we saw it coming, but none of us, none of us had any idea about total annihilation.</span> <span id="s502">We felt we are going to have a bad time, we are gonna be in for a very difficult period, you know, something like, you know, the [indecipherable] in the end of the 19th century, maybe worse, you know.</span> <span id="s503">Believe it or not, but we were preconditioned to the fact that for one reason or another, destiny has designated a lot of suffering and struggling for us, you know.</span> <span id="s504">And it -- it was a difficult time, but I don’t want to talk to you generalities, I want to talk to you specifics.</span> <span id="s505">Specifics is that in spite of all this, you know, life had to go on, life had to function.</span> <span id="s506">And the community had -- it -- it was a microcosm.</span> <span id="s507">Tom -- Tomashev was a microcosm of the larger being.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: For instance, if you talk about Wilno, Wilno had a very, very active, you know, cultural Jewish life, and you know, poets, and writers, you know, came out of there, it was that way.</span> <span id="s510">Wilno was described as Jerusalem of Lithuania.</span> <span id="s511">Or you talk about Warsaw.</span> <span id="s512">Warsaw was the capital of Poland.</span> <span id="s513">And you also had the emergence of a labor organized movement, a Jewish labor movement, the Bund, and the Communist party.</span> <span id="s514">The Communist party consisted -- members of the Communist party came from different walk of life, they came from poor working class, came from very rich.</span> <span id="s515">Some of my very dear friends, you know, and our parents were dear friends, they were members of the Communist party.</span> <span id="s516">But it was a small group.</span> <span id="s517">The biggest group was the Bund.</span> <span id="s518">These were the Jewish unions, so to say, unions.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: You know, that became part of a -- an organization.</span> <span id="s521">The Bund was not in favor of building a home in Israel, the Bund was in favor of establishing our presence, and our life, and our privileges in Poland, in th -- Lithuania, in Czechoslovakia, and they played a major role, because they did more than -- than -- than expressed -- you know formulated, you know, ad -- and advocated the policy of fighting for our rights.</span> <span id="s522">They gave the Jewish laborers a sense of pride, a sense of being something special, of being organized as a union.</span> <span id="s523">It -- it [indecipherable] and, you know, Medem was the leader of the Bund, but there were poets and writers, that were very much in favor of th -- very much siding, like [indecipherable] for instance, siding with the philosophy of the Bund, that we have to fight for our rights, for our existence in Poland.</span> <span id="s524">And there were designers that figured that we are wasting our time, that the ti -- the place where to go and concentrate our efforts is Palestine, because this is the land -- you know, Hertzel was earlier, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: But these were successions, and you know, it -- so what I’m trying to say to you, everything that I am talking to you about, did not happen from the beginning of the year to the end of the year.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: It was a gradual succession.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: [indecipherable] we -- were you ever attracted to join the Bund?</span> <span id="s530">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: No.</span> <span id="s533">I was a Zionist.</span> <span id="s534">The basic difference between the Bund, and the Zionist movement is the Bund, A was a labor organization.</span> <span id="s535">Fought religion, because they felt that religion is -- is opium for the masses.</span> <span id="s536">This used to be the slogan.</span> <span id="s537">And they fought -- they tried to ally themselves with Socialists, and -- pol -- Polish Socialists, which were on the [indecipherable] there was an organization of Polish Socialists, and they tried to align themselves with them.</span> <span id="s538">But if you ask me whether they were many wealthy Jewish people that became part of the Bund, perhaps.</span> <span id="s539">You know, it -- it wa -- this wasn’t a matter of wealth or poverty.</span> <span id="s540">By and large, you know, the Jewish people in Poland were poor people.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: You know.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s544">It was [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: They were a small percentage, you know, that emerged as people of substantial wealth.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Was there a middle class?</span> <span id="s547">Perhaps, but -- Q: Not big.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: No, and -- and it -- the middle class that we are talking about is a pitiful middle class.</span> <span id="s549">Middle class is where, you know, they scratched out a living, you know, and perhaps maybe a little more, but by and large, the Jews were not wealthy.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: By and large as I described it to you, until the changes started coming about, the husband was the one that was -- saw himself as the scholar, and he needs to study the Bible, and -- and sit, and go to services three times a day, and -- and what have you.</span> <span id="s552">And the woman was the one that sit in the marketplace, and sell some beans, or -- or -- or vegetables, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: -- or you know, herring, and a -- it -- it -- it was politic.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: Let me just ask you one -- one more question for this section.</span> <span id="s556">When you went to Lvov to go to school, what -- what were you studying, what did you think at this point if the w -- if your dad hadn’t died, and you didn’t go back home, what would you have done?</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: I would have -- I would have graduated th-th -- the junior college, and I would have gone to Israel.</span> <span id="s558">I had the promise of my parents that they will permit --</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: -- for this to happen, yes.</span> <span id="s561">Because, as I told you, it was my brother -- in particular my brother, and my younger sister, that paved the way for me, that --</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: -- you know, won some compromises from our parents.</span> <span id="s564">Our parents were very, very war - - religious, very religious.</span> <span id="s565">But smart, and worldly.</span> <span id="s566">They knew that the direction is.</span> <span id="s567">They refused to accept it, but they knew that the direction is going the way we are going, you know, to blend in, but no-not to get mixed in with society, but to be able that i -- study the language.</span> <span id="s568">There were many Jews that spoke a very broken Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: You know, a very broken Polish.</span> <span id="s571">And this was, no way, we -- we felt even if to stay in Poland, we must be part and parcel of the community as such.</span> <span id="s572">We must have our representatives in parliament, we must educate our children in -- in we -- there’s one thing I will want to tell you, that the Jews of the -- of Poland, and of Lithuania, had a tremendous sense for social justice.</span> <span id="s573">As I mentioned to you, they were loan -- a society to free -- a loan free -- interest free society.</span> <span id="s574">They were, in those days, to give you another example, they were -- to help a Jewish girl find a husband and get married was a big mitsveh.</span> <span id="s575">My mother was known that she always tries to find a match, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: And she arranged the wedding.</span> <span id="s578">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: She arranged the wedding.</span> <span id="s580">But it was a sense of social justice, a sense of helping people.</span> <span id="s581">And this was not only my mother, there were all, you know, many people in town that did that.</span> <span id="s582">There were many -- there were many customs there that need to be understood.</span> <span id="s583">For instance, there were beggars that were going from town to town and stopped, and asked for a fenegar, or a few pennies, and what have you.</span> <span id="s584">Friday night, they came to synagogue.</span> <span id="s585">It was an established custom that the synagogue -- th -- the people that belong to the synagogue cannot go home without taking a noyrech, which means a guest.</span> <span id="s586">And -- and he was seated at a table, you know, and he had Shabbas with us.</span> <span id="s587">Th-This was a very, very noble thing to do.</span> <span id="s588">There was a place, it was called the hagdish.</span> <span id="s589">A hagdish was a place -- a poor -- a -- a -- a -- a poorhouse, where these traveling beggars, you know, when they came, could come in and they got a bundle of straw, you know, and they could sleep.</span> <span id="s590">They didn’t pay anything for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: This was done by the cultural society of the community, and by the gemeni, which was the organized Jewish society, you know?</span> <span id="s593">We were of sorts, we always had a certain degree of self rule, you know, between ourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: To give you an example of self rule, if there was a dispute between two Jewish people, between two Jewish businessmen or what have you, it was customary not to go to court, but to go to a dintorah.</span> <span id="s596">They went to a -- to a rabbi -- not a rabbe, a rabbi, this was the functioning, and they both presented their case, and -- and he pass judgment, and whatever the judgment was, this was it.</span> <span id="s597">So what I’m trying to say to you is, in the small towns, and I’m talking about Tomashev as a microcosm because the same thing applied to Zamosc, and it applied to Lublin, depending how large it was, and what particular part of economic life is in one place.</span> <span id="s598">If there were a lot of forests, there were sawmills, if there was a lot of --</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: That’s okay [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: -- if there was a lot of agriculturals, there were flour mills, you know, the mills were normally settled, you know, in -- in -- in the areas where there were good col -- large agricultural, you know, teran -- terrains.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: Miles, it interests me that your parents, who clearly had a -- a very set idea about religion, and the importance of religion, were also very open, and smart enough not to alienate any of you children, who were moving in another direction.</span> <span id="s602">Cause there are different ways of handling these changes.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: Well, you’re not -- my brother -- you’re not -- didn’t have it so easy.</span> <span id="s604">Q: You had --</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: I had it easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: He paved the way for me.</span> <span id="s608">Q: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: He paved the way for me.</span> <span id="s610">He’s a wonderful guy, he just wrote a book, you know, that -- Q: Stone Pillars?</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: Stone Pillars.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: Yes, I read it.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: You know, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: It’s -- it’s wa -- quite wonderful.</span> <span id="s615">A: It’s very interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: Yes, it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: Because, you know, he talks about a -- an aspect of life that is hardly known here.</span> <span id="s618">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: You know.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: For instance, you asked me a question before, how did you, interact, with your friends, with your girls, and was there promiscuity, and what have you.</span> <span id="s622">Well, we were human beings, you know?</span> <span id="s623">Kids and dogs, they s -- weren’t any different than they are today.</span> <span id="s624">But this difference that, you know, my predecessors had the fear of religion, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Dating girls was not accepted, you know.</span> <span id="s626">So depends of the period that you are talking about.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: We’re going to change the tape now, we’ve come to the end of the tape.</span> <span id="s628">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: Miles, I wanted to go back to one question that I -- I think you moved away from a little bit.</span> <span id="s631">What were you studying?</span> <span id="s632">You were studying in order t -- when you went to Lvov -- in order to be able to go to Israel’s -- I mean Palestine, so that you were studying things that would be related?</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: Of sorts, yes.</span> <span id="s634">First of all, it was a junior college, where Hebrew was a very major part of it.</span> <span id="s635">And the arrangement was that one who graduated junior college in Lvov, gained a year in the university, could enter on the second year of the university immediately.</span> <span id="s636">So this was of sorts a program to make it easier for students who intended to study in the Jerusalem University.</span> <span id="s637">It was cheaper, it was easier, they didn’t have to leave home.</span> <span id="s638">So this was of sorts an in -- an inducement.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s640">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: And the studies, they were -- they were the secular studies, the normal studies like anybody else, plus the Hebrew.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: And were there things like agriculture being taught?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: Theoretically.</span> <span id="s644">The-theoretically.</span> <span id="s645">I’m serious about it, th -- what you are talking about is a different thing altogether, this was the kibbutzim.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: They were -- they were the people that young men and women, who were planning to go to Israel joined Hasharah, it was called, where they lear-learned to -- to plant, to cultivate, to chop woods, you know, and they -- the -- bear in mind that a good many of these young people grew up in -- in a non-physical world.</span> <span id="s648">Do you know -- am I expressing myself?</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: Yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: In -- it was the Hasharah where they were exposed to physical hardship.</span> <span id="s651">You know, they were exposed -- first of all they were taught a love for the soil, a love for planting, and -- and reaping.</span> <span id="s652">It was more than just a training school, it -- it was a training school in many ways.</span> <span id="s653">It was a process of refurbishing, redoing the mentality of the young people.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: And what was your favorite subject?</span> <span id="s655">A: My favorite subject?</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: History.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: And any particular part of history?</span> <span id="s661">A: No, history.</span> <span id="s662">I -- I -- I love history.</span> <span id="s663">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: I love history.</span> <span id="s665">When I -- when I read a historic novel, I don’t read the story.</span> <span id="s666">I -- I like to understand the -- the surrounding of it, what made it, what brought it about, and how did it affect, you know, the outside of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: So you like structure.</span> <span id="s668">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: You like to understand the structure of something.</span> <span id="s670">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: So had you been able to continue with school, you think you would have focused on history?</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: If my father wouldn’t have died, I had another year and a half to graduate the -- the -- the -- the seminar, what we called.</span> <span id="s673">And I would have gone to Israel, to the [indecipherable] Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">A: Because, you see, my going to Israel was a two fold one.</span> <span id="s675">Number one, I wanted the education, you know, as a Jew, because my brother influenced me a lot, and as a young man, when I look back today, I was a very -- he -- he -- he educated me.</span> <span id="s676">He brainwashed me, if you want to use this terminology.</span> <span id="s677">And I was a very ardent believer in th -- in -- in the Jews have no choice, this is the only way, is to go to Israel, to Palestine, and build a home.</span> <span id="s678">A -- a Jew -- build a Jewish homeland.</span> <span id="s679">Build a Jewish homeland.</span> <span id="s680">Now, I -- I’m ke -- I’m coming back to the Tomashev, and I ke -- use the terminology t -- a microcosm.</span> <span id="s681">Tomashev was a very vibrant community, I have very fond memories of it, in every possible way.</span> <span id="s682">The fact that, you know, the doors opened for me, you know, culturally, historically, intellectually.</span> <span id="s683">I didn’t sense it at that time.</span> <span id="s684">At that time I was excited with the issue of the day.</span> <span id="s685">I was excited with a soccer game that I participated in playing, or -- or a ping pong game, or -- or what have you.</span> <span id="s686">And this was all -- you know, these were all things that took us away from the synagogue, and took us to the outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s688">Was your father sick for a long time, did you exp --</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s690">He was not.</span> <span id="s691">He had high blood pressure, and had the stroke, and he didn’t come out of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s693">So that was a big shock -- A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: -- for the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s696">He was a very, very loving father.</span> <span id="s697">Very loving father.</span> <span id="s698">Di -- di -- no -- you’re smiling.</span> <span id="s699">The -- you have to look at life as it was.</span> <span id="s700">They were people that were bitter, and as a result of this became bitter with their children.</span> <span id="s701">They were bitter they had poverty, they were bitter on their, you know, being persecuted as Jews, they were bitter that they didn’t marry right, because this was not a time where marriage was, you know, by a boy finding a girl, it was matchmaking.</span> <span id="s702">All these things, you know, had played a role in how the community functions.</span> <span id="s703">But I must tell you that my recollections of the community are very good, because when I look back at it, you know, and I look at all these things, you know, like making sure that no Jewish girl remains an alteh moid, an -- an old maid.</span> <span id="s704">You know, very nice.</span> <span id="s705">It affected -- there was a poor house where a person could go in and go to sleep without any questions.</span> <span id="s706">Very nice, you know.</span> <span id="s707">It -- it -- it affected Friday night, that no man could remain without being fed.</span> <span id="s708">These are things that, you know, speak to you.</span> <span id="s709">They give you the quality, you know.</span> <span id="s710">And then I started -- I am coming back to the breakthrough.</span> <span id="s711">Reading the poetry, bre -- reading Bialek, read -- reading, you know the Chonyahofsky.</span> <span id="s712">I-It was a new world, and it was an exciting world.</span> <span id="s713">I remember we used to si -- recite by heart, you know, poems like [indecipherable] you know [indecipherable] the city of Florida, you know, and what have you.</span> <span id="s714">So all in all, my recollections of those day, taking into consideration the restrictions, the constraints, and the situations as they were, my recollections are good.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s716">Do you remember the funeral of your father?</span> <span id="s717">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Q: Was it a big funeral?</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A: A very big funeral.</span> <span id="s720">What I remember specifically, it was not customary in nower -- in those days, that if a Jew died, that they should be necrolog -- necrology, it -- they should be in -- in the paper, the -- you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Q: Oh, an obituary.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">A: Obituaries.</span> <span id="s723">My father had three quarters of the paper full of obituaries from all over Poland.</span> <span id="s724">And this was not customary for -- well, for those days, for Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: So that must have been very moving to the whole family.</span> <span id="s726">A: It was, it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: And the funeral was a very traditional Orthodox funeral?</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: Very much so.</span> <span id="s729">Ver -- an Orthodox funeral.</span> <span id="s730">Th -- in those days it was customary that the body was washed by a special group, and dressed in white linen, and he was carried from -- carried to the funeral -- to the cemetery.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: In a pine box?</span> <span id="s732">No.</span> <span id="s733">A: Not in a box.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: Carried with the -- in the white --</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: Carried -- he wa -- it was like a -- al -- it -- it -- i -- a -- a -- like hard tree boards, you know, tied together, and it was an honor to carry the -- the ti -- the -- to carry the deceased, you know.</span> <span id="s736">And people walked over, there were usually eight people that carried them.</span> <span id="s737">And when he was -- when the -- the body was brought to the cemetery, there were within -- within the grave, there were sideboards, but the Jewish law called for that the body must -- the body must lay on soil.</span> <span id="s738">And this conflicted with the laws of Poland.</span> <span id="s739">The laws of Poland were that you had to be in a box.</span> <span id="s740">So what they did is they built the -- the sideboards, and then -- and headboards, but before they started covering it, they pulled the boards out.</span> <span id="s741">That’s breaking the law, but they d -- what I’m trying to say to you, that a religious law, to Jews, prevailed, always prevailed.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: Were there speeches at the funeral, or not?</span> <span id="s743">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Q: Oh no, just prayers.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: Yes, there were, before it -- before he was put in the -- in the -- in the grave, but of a religious nature.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s747">Now, your father was what, 56?</span> <span id="s748">A: And my father was 56 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: And your mother was a little younger, or -- A: My mother was three or four years younger.</span> <span id="s750">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: You know, but my mother perished.</span> <span id="s752">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: In the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Q: Yes, I understand.</span> <span id="s755">How did -- how was she after her husband died, was this -- it must have been a very difficult time --</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: It was a very difficult period.</span> <span id="s757">It affected us strongly, you know.</span> <span id="s758">You know, we were -- used to know the Jarket Lerman, the strong, the assertive, the decision maker, the p -- the power in the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">Q: No more?</span></p> <p><span id="s760">A: Nope.</span> <span id="s761">She was -- she was very -- she was broody -- she was brooding, you know.</span> <span id="s762">It affected her very strongly.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: So they were an extremely close couple, I gather?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s765">Close, but bear in mind, you are talking about a Hassidic couple.</span> <span id="s766">Q: Has -- yes, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">A: You know.</span> <span id="s768">I don’t remember seeing my father kissing my mother.</span> <span id="s769">Q: Or holding her hand.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: Or holding -- well, holding her hand -- Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: -- I don’t remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">Q: That’s interesting.</span> <span id="s773">But clearly, given her response -- A: Oh, very much so.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q: Then it was something --</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A: They had a wonderful, wonderful life together.</span> <span id="s776">But it was a Hassidic life, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s778">So, do all of the -- the brothers and sisters who are home, get together after -- a few days after the funeral and decide --</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Q: -- that you do need to come -- A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: -- you can’t continue with school.</span> <span id="s782">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: Was --</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: Well, Mother predominantly, because she felt that, you know, that she liked me a lot, and as far as my brother is concerned, you know he was in Israel, you know, and Shlomo, and Esther and Peshe, they were married, they had their own families, you know, and what have you.</span> <span id="s785">So she felt that I am the closest to her, and she will need me.</span> <span id="s786">And it was a decision that family made, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s788">Did that disappoint you in some way?</span></p> <p><span id="s789">A: It did, because I very much wanted to graduate, I wanted to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s790">I was hoping that I will prevail upon my mother, you know, to invest in Israel, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q: Ok -- s-so you -- so you come home, and you live at home now with your mother -- A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: -- I gather, right?</span> <span id="s793">And you take over what?</span></p> <p><span id="s794">A: I, at that time, took over -- assisted mother in her business -- Q: In her business.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: In her business.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: And so what’s happening to your father’s -- the mill business, what was that --</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: My oldest brother.</span> <span id="s798">Q: Shlomo.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: Shlomo stepped into it.</span> <span id="s800">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Q: And Esther, and Peshe are --</span></p> <p><span id="s803">A: Esther was in the flour mills all along.</span> <span id="s804">Esther lost her first husband a few years after they got married.</span> <span id="s805">And she remarried, and she had two children with her new husband, and she was always in the flour mills.</span> <span id="s806">But one was in Beljets.</span> <span id="s807">By the way, one of our mills was right across the street from the death camp of Beljets --</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: Unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: But, you know, I am talking -- I’m jumping ahead of myself.</span> <span id="s810">Q: Jumping ahead, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: But Esther was always, Esther and her husband, Yoshu, they were always involved with the flour -- with the flour mill business.</span> <span id="s812">And one was in Beljets, one was in Zamusc, one was in Tomashev, one was in Daszhisk.</span> <span id="s813">You know, so this was a big business.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q: Mm.</span> <span id="s815">So you have, what?</span> <span id="s816">A year, two years before the war starts?</span> <span id="s817">A: Two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q: Two years.</span> <span id="s819">Was this --</span></p> <p><span id="s820">A: Two -- a year and a half to be exact.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s822">Was this difficult for you, to make this switch to be [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s823">A: I missed -- I missed my town.</span> <span id="s824">I missed Lvov, I missed the life in Lvov, because it was a very modern life already, with, you know, theaters, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">A: -- you know, operas, and ballets, and it was a -- that -- it -- it was a -- that -- th-the life, you know, that -- you know, modern -- modern people have appreciated, and, you know, I could afford it, I could afford the tickets and what have you.</span> <span id="s827">It was great life, wonderful, and I had good friends in school, wonderful, wonderful people I -- you know -</span></p> <p><span id="s828">-</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: So your life became somewhat smaller again, in a certain way, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s831">It -- it -- no, I -- I wouldn’t say it became smaller, because when I came back, I was more assertive, and mother recognized that if she wants me, she cannot fight me, you know.</span> <span id="s832">So I was very active in working with mother, but I was very active in the community.</span> <span id="s833">I was active in our -- our sports club was the Harpoyle.</span> <span id="s834">I was active in the sports club, I was active in Shamere Atsyere, you know, and we -- I brought you some pictures out -- i-it’s amazing, you know.</span> <span id="s835">You will see a group of people, you know, like you’d see a group of people here, young ones today, but wonderful, wonderful, and some of them are really -- you could sense, you could feel that they are the future leaders of -- of the -- and -- of the community, or the Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s837">Did you like business in some ways?</span></p> <p><span id="s838">A: Yes, yes, but I didn’t permit it to swallow me.</span> <span id="s839">I liked it very much, but I didn’t permit it to swallow me.</span> <span id="s840">No, I had a sense for business.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s842">Clearly.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">A: If you asking me whether I was the scholarly type, always to -- to live on books, and -- and -- no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Q: In terms of hearing about what’s going on in Germany, in 1938, in November, there’s Kristallnacht, there’s The Night of Broken Glass.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">Q: You heard about this.</span> <span id="s847">Was there any repercussions in Poland, where you were?</span> <span id="s848">A: As I told you before, first of all, Poland itself was in an escalating process of anti- Semitism.</span> <span id="s849">The leader of the Polish government, who was most benevolent, was Pilsudski, and after he died, the right wing organizations took the upper hand in Parliament, and took the upper hand in the country.</span> <span id="s850">And you know, again the same story.</span> <span id="s851">They were afraid of Germany as much as we did.</span> <span id="s852">And their fear expressed itself by finding victims, you know, by looking for scapegoats.</span> <span id="s853">And anti-Semitism escalated substantially, very substantially.</span> <span id="s854">And these were not good days in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Q: Was there any kind of pogrom right after Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s856">A: There was -- there was a pogrom in Pshittik.</span> <span id="s857">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">A: One pogrom, but Jews resisted.</span> <span id="s859">The Jews resisted, but there was a pogrom, and one Jew got killed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">Q: But in Tomashev?</span> <span id="s861">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: No.</span> <span id="s864">But, for instance, it was customary before the boys went to the army, they had to go and, you know, be checked out whether they’re healthy, whether they’re suitable, whether they’re fitted.</span> <span id="s865">So the boys from Tomashev, and the surrounding areas used to come and this was kind of like a -- a bachelor’s party, you know, so they went into the liquor stores, and bought liquor, got drunk and started beating up Jews.</span> <span id="s866">We in Tomashev didn’t take too kindly to it, so we organized -- even my brother, in his youth, you know, organized defense.</span> <span id="s867">And when they started beating up Jews, next time the Jews were prepared for it, and they got their portion, and they’d stopped it.</span> <span id="s868">So it was a normal, ongoing life.</span> <span id="s869">It wasn’t all peaches and cream, it wasn’t all wonderful things.</span> <span id="s870">There were, you know difficulties, there were sadness in it.</span> <span id="s871">But also, health.</span> <span id="s872">I’m not talking about physical health, I’m talking commununal health.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">Q: Was there talk about war, about Germany attacking Poland in ’38 - ’39?</span></p> <p><span id="s874">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s875">Because first of all, Czechoslovakia was invaded already.</span> <span id="s876">Austria was invad -- not invad -- invaded -- invaded by -- invited, but invaded.</span> <span id="s877">So i-it was clear, without any question in Hitler, you know, Hitler and Goebbels, you know what they are, remarks, public -- public addresses, they talked about expansion, you know, labensurround, which means they needed space to expand, you know, to be able to live, and to allow the -- the Third Reich, which they were hoping that will last a thousand years, to establish itself, not -- th-the -- there -- the signals -- the signs were there, without any question.</span> <span id="s878">The signs were there that we are heading for bad times, but no one -- no one had any inkling of what was coming.</span> <span id="s879">I’m talking about a massive annihilation.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: Did the -- did the Polish government say we can defeat the -- I mean, was -- was there a kind of propaganda, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: There was empty talk, sure, sure.</span> <span id="s882">I remember two days before the Germans invaded Poland they were -- you know, there was a dispute over Dansik.</span> <span id="s883">Dansik was a -- a free city, you know, that was near -- it was a port city, a free city.</span> <span id="s884">So you could see young Poles going on the streets, we will smother them with our helmets, we will throw the helmets at them.</span> <span id="s885">You know, empty talk, you know, bravado, and what have you.</span> <span id="s886">But we realized that we are dealing with a formidable enemy.</span> <span id="s887">It was an enemy -- to describe it to you, the Poles had cavalry.</span> <span id="s888">You know, riding, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s889">Q: Horses, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">A: Horses.</span> <span id="s891">And good cavalry, a good army, but this cavalry had to fight tanks.</span> <span id="s892">How does cavalry fight tanks, you know, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s893">Q: At what age wer -- was one s -- wer-were boys supposed to be conscripted, 18?</span> <span id="s894">A: No, 21.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">Q: Ah, 21.</span> <span id="s896">So you were not at that point yet.</span> <span id="s897">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">Q: Fortunately.</span> <span id="s899">So what’s the first experience of war in 1939 for you, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: Well, it was -- it came unexpectedly.</span> <span id="s901">I -- I mean there were -- you know, that -- feuds -- there were the discussions, and -- and the Polish minister Farnafayas, who went to Berlin to try to negotiate something, and they would have -- in my opinion they would have been very good collaborators.</span> <span id="s902">The way the -- th -- it prevailed at that time, the Socialist party is, among Poles, weakened.</span> <span id="s903">The -- the extreme right party got stronger, and you asked me what was the first impact of war?</span> <span id="s904">Totally unexpected air raids, killing and burning.</span> <span id="s905">Killing and burning, you know, homes.</span> <span id="s906">Our home was burned the second day of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">Q: Wow.</span> <span id="s908">And where were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: I was at that time, when the war broke out, the biggest problem was to get gasoline, you know, to have -- so we had -- the Polish army retreated, and there was -- two officers were in Poland with a car.</span> <span id="s910">And I made them an offer, because in our business, we also had a wholesale business of gasoline.</span> <span id="s911">It’s like [indecipherable] you know, everything of [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s912">We had many businesses.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">A: So we have gasoline, and we had it stored in a warehouse.</span> <span id="s915">I offered them, you know, to fill up their car, and to take four or five containers, and I should go with them, and they were -- they -- they backed up without realizing that from the other side, the Soviet Union will come in, you know.</span> <span id="s916">So I was not home, and I came home a few days later, and all of Poland was occupied already.</span> <span id="s917">And I found Mother.</span> <span id="s918">The house was burned.</span> <span id="s919">A major -- the store was burned, and the whole city was badly damaged.</span> <span id="s920">Two of my colleagues that I grew up with were killed in the bombardment, you know.</span> <span id="s921">It was sporadic bombardment that -- not that there was any specific reason to bombard Tomashev.</span> <span id="s922">It was not a -- you know, a military center or anything, it was a community.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s924">Do you remember your -- your impression as this young person, who’s lived a rather privileged life in many ways, coming back into --</span></p> <p><span id="s925">A: I was very shaken, very shaken.</span> <span id="s926">Very scared.</span> <span id="s927">And I know one thing, that I will not stay with the Germans.</span> <span id="s928">So I moved forward -- because I came back, I told you, when I w-went with these officers.</span> <span id="s929">And at that time, when the Soviet army came in, a good many people looked to them as liberators, because, you know, they -- they were talking about freedom of the individual, and no anti-Semitism, you know, that it’s against the law to be anti- Semitic and what have you.</span> <span id="s930">So we truly believed that, you know, they are the defenders of right, and good, and so I went to Lvov, because Lvov was the city where I studied, and I -- I knew the city.</span> <span id="s931">And I took mother with me to Lvov, and then my sister came, and then my brother came.</span> <span id="s932">So it was turmoil, it was turmoil.</span> <span id="s933">Our town was occupied by the Germans.</span> <span id="s934">In our town, the border between the occupation that wa -- they carved up Poland into two half, was about 20 miles south of -- of our town.</span> <span id="s935">So, my mother and my sister left Tomashev because it was burned down, and they were, in the beginning when they came in, they killed a few Jews, just without any reason.</span> <span id="s936">So the signals were bad, and we felt that being with Russians is going to be, you know, a way of surviving, not having all these things in a Communist regime, but surviving.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: Now, Lvov is about what, 120 kilometers?</span> <span id="s938">A: More or less, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: From Tomashev.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: From Tomashev.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: So how did you go from one to the other, and what did you take, one place to the other?</span> <span id="s942">A: Took nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">Q: Nothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s944">A: There was nothing to take.</span> <span id="s945">I --</span></p> <p><span id="s946">Q: Because the place had burned down.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">A: You know, sure.</span> <span id="s948">I c -- I think my -- my older brother, Shlomo, gave me some of his clothing, because where he lived, and my sister Peshe lived, this was not bombarded, so they remained.</span> <span id="s949">And I got some clothing from them, and I -- and I went, and I took Mother with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: And how did you go, you walked?</span></p> <p><span id="s951">A: Partially walked, and partially on -- on trucks, you know.</span> <span id="s952">It -- it -- because the military, the -- the Soviet military units were only about eight miles from us.</span> <span id="s953">So the minute we got into Ravaruska, which was the next town, you know, the -- no, there was a small one, Lubicha, a small one in between.</span> <span id="s954">But Ravaruska was already a town more or less the size of ours, maybe a little bigger.</span> <span id="s955">And there we had people that -- customers, they used to buy from us, and -- and what have you.</span> <span id="s956">So, it wasn’t in two [indecipherable] so to say.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">We got into Ravaruska, and to catch our breath, and collect our senses, and from there I said to Mother, “Let’s go to Lvov, because this is a large city, and we’ll be able to function better.”</span></p> <p><span id="s958">Q: Now I know this is going to sound stupid, but do you have money?</span> <span id="s959">Do you have banks in other towns other than Tomashev?</span> <span id="s960">I mean what are you -- you’re coming into a place where the --</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: The only thing what we -- what -- the -- the -- the question is a good question, no we didn’t, because whatever was it -- in -- in -- in our home, including, you know, jewelry and what have you, this all burned down.</span> <span id="s962">The jewelry, I think, was found by somebody and they refused to rec -- to admit that they found it.</span> <span id="s963">And mother and I came in with practically nothing.</span> <span id="s964">But how did we survive?</span> <span id="s965">In Lemberg -- in Lvov, there were several factories that we bought stuff from them.</span> <span id="s966">There was a candy factory that we bought candy from them.</span> <span id="s967">There was a factory of lachmas, which is a blue color that you put into -- into whitewash, you know, to paint houses.</span> <span id="s968">So, at that time, b-before the Russians establish themselves, there was an in between period, a hiatus.</span> <span id="s969">So the fact that we dealt with them, and we knew them -- so they gave us s-some of the m -- some of the manufactured goods at hard cost prices from before the war.</span> <span id="s970">And this was the war, and everything jumped a thousandfold.</span> <span id="s971">So in -- we -- this gave us a good start, and we have managed to establish ourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Q: So they gave it to you on a loan because you didn’t have anything to -- A: Sure, we didn’t have anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">Q: -- obviously, so then you paid it off.</span> <span id="s974">A: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: But the object was to get it and to take it out from the factory, because as [indecipherable] the factory [indecipherable] 10 times as much.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s978">So where did you live?</span> <span id="s979">A: We got an apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">Q: So you didn’t go to your father’s sister?</span> <span id="s981">Not with --</span></p> <p><span id="s982">A: Not with Mother, because you know, she didn’t have an enormously large apartment.</span> <span id="s983">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s984">So did you rent a place?</span></p> <p><span id="s985">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Q: You did?</span></p> <p><span id="s987">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">Q: And -- a nice place, a simple -- A: A nice place, it -- di --</span></p> <p><span id="s989">Q: Not like what you had.</span></p> <p><span id="s990">A: Not like what we had.</span> <span id="s991">It was a small -- a small -- it was a room with a very small kitchen.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">With a -- with a small -- small set up.</span> <span id="s993">But for Mother and I it was enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">Q: But now your -- your brother Shlomo came, and Esther came, and -- and Peshe -- A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Q: Peshe came.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">A: Esther -- Esther remained where she was, because Esther was in an area where it was right on the border, but it was the Russians, you know.</span> <span id="s997">So they were there, but Peshe came, you know and it -- it was a matter of trying to organize ourselves, to find a place where to sleep and, you know, and how to -- how to earn a -- a -- to buy a l -- a loaf of bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">A: We went from extreme riches, to extreme poverty.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Q: It’s a big --</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">A: It’s a transition.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q: A big transition.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">A: And a difficult one.</span> <span id="s1004">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">A: But i -- the -- the good name that Mother had, and the reputation that Mother had, was very helpful with these businesses that were in Lvov, you know, for us to bounce back a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Q: And how was her mood now?</span> <span id="s1007">A: Sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">Q: Her mood?</span> <span id="s1009">How -- was she coming out of depression, or -- A: Very depressed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">Q: Very depressed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">A: Very depressed, very depressed.</span> <span id="s1012">And, you know, she couldn’t take all this, you know, and I -- I am very, very glad today, that -- at the opportunities developed in a way that I could be with her, and I could steady, and I could be of help to her, because I loved Mother very much, I -- she was a very special lady.</span> <span id="s1013">Very special lady.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">Q: I don’t -- I don’t know the ti -- the times well enough.</span> <span id="s1015">Wo-would you talk to her about her feelings, or did you simply try to [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: We just tried to do.</span> <span id="s1017">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">A: You just tried to do.</span> <span id="s1019">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">A: You know, again, you know, you are talking about days when a mother and son didn’t embrace and kiss.</span> <span id="s1021">I kissed her hand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">Q: In the old fashioned way of kissing hand, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">A: Yes, yes, when I came from out of town, shook hands, I kissed her hand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: How interesting.</span> <span id="s1027">And your sisters, how were they?</span> <span id="s1028">W-Was there more affection between mother and daughter?</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: There was more affection -- no, affection there was -- you’re talking about visible affection?</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">Q: Th -- yes, physical affection -- A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">Q: -- I didn’t mean feelings.</span> <span id="s1032">A: Bet -- between sister, yes.</span> <span id="s1033">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">A: Yes, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">Q: Did your mother have friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">A: Mother had friends, but I am trying -- I am thinking what to tell you.</span> <span id="s1037">Mother had friends, but these were not friends that they went to play golf, or you know.</span> <span id="s1038">These were friends that were similar in -- in -- you know, in their -- in their religious -- in the degree of their religiosity.</span> <span id="s1039">Friends that, you know, that were also at least middle class, you know, at least middle class, with whom they had something in common, you know, and -- neighbors, you know.</span> <span id="s1040">Are you asking me whether there was an organized Jewish social life for religious women?</span> <span id="s1041">Not quite.</span> <span id="s1042">Not quite.</span> <span id="s1043">Fr-Free time was for prayer, for -- for study, and you know.</span> <span id="s1044">And there wasn’t any free time.</span> <span id="s1045">There wasn’t any free time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">Q: Right, because you had to work so hard.</span> <span id="s1047">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">Q: But did you immediately go back with the friends that you had from school, was there ano -- a re --</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">A: Oh, I -- we picked up --</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A: -- well, first of all, the turmoil was all over -- Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">A: -- in, you know, some as I told you were killed, you know, from the bombardment.</span> <span id="s1053">Some went into Russia immediately and some remained in pol -- in Lvov.</span> <span id="s1054">And I had no trouble regrouping and finding my friends, and finding some of my friends, and -- and I made new friends, young people made new friends easily.</span> <span id="s1055">The object was to grow in into a new system, to a new society.</span> <span id="s1056">A society that, you know, perfomra advocated, you know, wonderful things.</span> <span id="s1057">But it was far from it.</span> <span id="s1058">It was far from it.</span> <span id="s1059">Now, believe it or not, but when things settled down a little bit, there was many people, many Jews that felt that they want to go back home.</span> <span id="s1060">Many.</span> <span id="s1061">They want to go back home, they -- because you know, the -- the mass killings didn’t start yet.</span> <span id="s1062">We are talking ’39.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">A: You know, the mass killing -- the actual mass killing started in ’41.</span> <span id="s1065">In between ’39 and ’41 there were sporadic killings, there were brutalities, there were catching Jews and taking them to work, you know, to dig ditches, and what have you.</span> <span id="s1066">But there was not the onslaught, you know, the -- th-the massive process of annihilation was not there yet, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">Q: So there were people who were in Lvov who decided to go back to -- A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">Q: -- where the Germans were occupying in Tomashev.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1070">And another thing is that the Russians suggested to the -- those that came and stayed there to take Russian passports.</span> <span id="s1071">And the Jews didn’t want to take Russian passports because they were hoping that, you know, things will straighten out, and they will be able to go home.</span> <span id="s1072">So the Russians gave them passports with an 11th paragraph, that this is what it was called.</span> <span id="s1073">And this is -- 11th paragraph was a passport of not trustworthy people, that they could not live a hundred kilometers -- less than a hundred kilometers from the border.</span> <span id="s1074">And then, after awhile, it was the first massive tran -- ex -- th -- th -- the first massive transport of Jews from Poland, and Poles from Poland.</span> <span id="s1075">Poles even more so, to Siberia.</span> <span id="s1076">And my brother and his family were taken to Siberia.</span> <span id="s1077">My sister Peshe was taken to Siberia.</span> <span id="s1078">And Mother was on the train already, to be taken to Siberia.</span> <span id="s1079">But when I came back from work, and I found out what is happening, I went out to the rail station.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">And there was a general from the KGB.</span> <span id="s1081">And I walked over to him, and I say, “I have a complaint.”</span> <span id="s1082">You know, general of KGB didn’t know what it means to have a complaint.</span> <span id="s1083">I was naïve, you know.</span> <span id="s1084">I said I have a complaint, and he said, “What is your complaint?”</span> <span id="s1085">I say, “Why did you take my mother away?”</span> <span id="s1086">I am a citizen of Lvov, I have studied in Lvov before the war, she lives with me, and you have no reason to take her away.”</span> <span id="s1087">So he looked at me, and looked at me, and he said, “Do you know where she is?”</span> <span id="s1088">I say, “No, but I know the transport.”</span> <span id="s1089">So he went with me, and we knocked in the boxcars, and calling her name.</span> <span id="s1090">And finally I found the boxcar and I took her out, and took her back home.</span> <span id="s1091">Of about 120 people that were, you know, e-expedited -- that -- do you know, exported, two people came out.</span> <span id="s1092">One was a grandmother of a officer of the KGB, he escaped to Russia 20 years before that, and my mother.</span> <span id="s1093">And I brought her out, you know, to -- she would have survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">Q: If th -- if she had gone, yeah.</span> <span id="s1095">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">Q: But who was gonna know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">A: Who was know -- who -- who was -- who was to know at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">Q: And the -- the -- I think I’m not exactly clear about why these particular people were sent.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">They were considered to be --</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">A: They were considered not trustworthy.</span> <span id="s1101">Q: Trustworthy people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">A: The excuse was that they are not trustworthy people, and they are taking to Siberia to help build the -- the Russian effort.</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">Q: And where --</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">A: Anyone that -- I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s1105">Q: No, no, go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">A: Anyone that the KGB, or the Encoverdaire, which was called at that time, did not consider trustworthy, you know, for turning the new terrains over into an established Communist regime, were shipped off.</span> <span id="s1107">Many Poles -- many Poles were shipped off, and -- and perhaps in a more cruel manner, because these were the former police, the former judges, the former -- you know, the Polish intelligentsia.</span> <span id="s1108">The Soviets felt that the intelligentsia is the most dangerous for them, because these are people that, you know, are thinking, and -- and they will eventually form resistance organizations, so they felt that the best thing to do is to ship them off to Siberia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">A: I was working at -- no, the railroad I was working at a time when the Nazis came in.</span> <span id="s1110">Q: Uh-huh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">A: I was in the supply -- in the su -- in s -- in the office of supply, state office of supply.</span> <span id="s1112">Q: Ah, for the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">Q: And what does that mean, Miles, what does that kind of a job -- A: In Russian it’s called snubjoinya.</span> <span id="s1115">Subjoinya means to supply.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">A: Where i-if s -- if a factory -- let’s assume a factory that was manufacturing suits, I’ll give you an example, needed the material, they couldn’t buy it directly, they had to go through the state office of supply, they got a material.</span> <span id="s1118">They needed lining, it was a different story.</span> <span id="s1119">They needed buttons, it was a different story.</span> <span id="s1120">The same thing goes for any other.</span> <span id="s1121">Let’s say food supplies.</span> <span id="s1122">They had -- everything had to go through the office of supply, it was a very peculiar way of running a -- an economy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">Q: And you were -- what -- what was your job in this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">A: My job, I was like a -- th -- a -- a -- the maseetsala channika -- I’m saying it in Russian, a -- a vice chair of a department.</span> <span id="s1125">A vice -- a vis -- a vice manager -- a -- the assistant manager of a department.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">Q: And how did you get this job?</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">A: I needed the job, and you know, I wanted to do something, you know, that you can use your head a little bit, I wasn’t interested you know, in -- in -- in going out on the farm and working, and what have you.</span> <span id="s1128">And th-the fact that, you know, they knew that I am educated, and I will learn the Russian quickly, th -- they -- they also wanted an educated cadre, you know, to work for them, and they wanted an educated cadre which will promote, and will help them, you know, implement, you know, the Communist regime.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">Q: So your sort of Capitalist background didn’t bother them, in this case?</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">A: No, th -- well, it -- I needed to be careful not to tell them too much about it, because when you went for a job, you needed to apply -- you applied for the job, and you needed to write your life history.</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">A: This was a common thing, no matter what you did [indecipherable] an application with the life history.</span> <span id="s1133">They needed to know immediately who you were, you know.</span> <span id="s1134">So, with the life history, I had trouble.</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">Q: So you fudged it a little bit.</span> <span id="s1136">A: Fudged it.</span> <span id="s1137">Fudged it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1139">Now, your mother is also working in some way, or not at all at this point?</span> <span id="s1140">A: At this point, y -- b --</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">Q: -- we’re now --</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">A: -- we are talk about a period where the factories were already nationalized, and it was -- you couldn’t get any more.</span> <span id="s1143">In other words, the -- the -- the -- the gray market period is gone, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">Q: So are we talking 1940 now?</span> <span id="s1145">A: We are talking 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">A: The beginning of 1940.</span> <span id="s1148">And this went on, you know, with intensification, until it -- June of 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1150">Now, yo -- your mother then, her life is really i -- in -- more radically changed, because she doesn’t have work to do.</span> <span id="s1151">So it’s -- so you’re supporting her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">A: I s -- I was supporting mother, she -- she kept home for me.</span> <span id="s1153">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">A: You know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">Q: And Peshe is in Lvov?</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">A: Peshe was in Siberia by then.</span> <span id="s1157">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">A: And my brother was in Siberia.</span> <span id="s1159">And -- Q: Did they go on their own?</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">Q: No, they were sent.</span> <span id="s1162">They’re sent in that -- A: That was -- I told you, in that transport.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">Q: And that’s -- same transport.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">A: And that -- mother i -- for instance, to send packages to my sister and to my brother, you couldn’t do it from Lvov.</span> <span id="s1165">Don’t ask me why, but you couldn’t do it from Lvov, you had to go to Kolomia.</span> <span id="s1166">And Kolomia was a hundred, 130 kilometers from Lvov.</span> <span id="s1167">So, for Mother to send a couple of packages to my sister and to my brother, it was a two day effort.</span> <span id="s1168">You know, get on the train, go to Kolomias, stay in line, send the package, come back.</span> <span id="s1169">So this she did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">A: It was not easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">A: It was a difficult time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Q: So, you earned enough to pay the rent, to ba -- purchase food.</span> <span id="s1175">A: Yes, no I earned enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">A: Di -- judging by -- by those circumstances, at that time, this was a pretty good job.</span> <span id="s1178">A pretty good job.</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">Q: Did you feel comfortable with the Russians, and what they were ch -- what you thought they were trying to do at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">A: I -- I -- I felt comfortable because first of all, bear in mind, I was a product of Shamere Atsyere.</span> <span id="s1181">I was a product of, you know, leftist leanings.</span> <span id="s1182">And, you know, I did not believe that -- you know, these stories that revealed themself later, that they are so brutal, and they are so, you know, authoritarian, and so if -- so far away from what they were preaching.</span> <span id="s1183">They were preaching one thing and doing another.</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">Q: But you didn’t believe it at the time?</span> <span id="s1185">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">Q: Your experience was not that, either.</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">A: My experience wasn’t -- wasn’t like this, and you know -- but I knew that they are -- it’s not a liberal system, but it -- to make the comparison between Poland, of what we started, you know, feeling and experiencing, said so the heck with the wealth, and the heck -- heck with the material comfort.</span> <span id="s1188">At least here, you know, I am an equal with equals, and you know, I’m doing a good job, and I’m getting compensated, and perhaps later I will be upgraded, and so on and so on.</span> <span id="s1189">So for all practical purposes, I was satisfied.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">Q: Were they asking you to join the Communist party?</span> <span id="s1191">Was there any pressure?</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">A: Not that easy.</span> <span id="s1193">Joining the Communist party was not so fast.</span> <span id="s1194">First of all, it -- it was a gradual thing.</span> <span id="s1195">And they -- you needed to prove yourself I -- at your word, and -- at meetings, because on every -- every workstation, there were political meetings, and you needed to stand up, and you know, praise the system, and praise -- praise what’s going on.</span> <span id="s1196">Getting into the Communist party was not an easy manner, and I wasn’t too anxious for it.</span> <span id="s1197">I was still hoping that -- you know, that somehow things will settle down.</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">A: Still didn’t think of Germany as a country of mass killers.</span> <span id="s1200">You know, we figured, you know, we had Pshittik, the pogrom of Pshittik, so they had the -- the -- the Night of the Broken Glass.</span> <span id="s1201">And everybody -- most people believed that the terrible things that you heard abo -- from Hitler and from Goering and from Goebbels, that it will blow over.</span> <span id="s1202">Human nature is such that you look for hope.</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">A: You -- for the slightest thread that you can catch, this is human nature.</span> <span id="s1205">Human nature does not accept the formidable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">Q: Did you hear about what was happening in Poland?</span> <span id="s1207">The yet -- the establishment of ghettos, since --</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">A: Not yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">Q: You hadn’t heard anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">A: No.</span> <span id="s1211">No, there were no ghettos yet.</span> <span id="s1212">The ghettos started in 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">Q: Right, but we’re in 1940.</span> <span id="s1214">That’s a -- A: Yes, in 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">Q: ’40 [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">A: Yes, we heard that Jews are being isolated, and -- but again, isolated, but not for mass killings, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">Q: Not for that, right.</span> <span id="s1218">And there’s -- is there talk of -- is Germany going to attack?</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">A: Yes, there is talk.</span> <span id="s1220">First of all there is talk that, you know there are sporadic killings, and that the Germans are very brutal.</span> <span id="s1221">And that the SS is a political party, it’s not a military party, it’s a political party.</span> <span id="s1222">We heard all these things, and that’s why we felt that being in Russia was, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">Q: [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">A: -- a wonderful thing.</span> <span id="s1225">Q: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">A: A wonderful thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">Q: So, your perspective on what’s happening is you’re going to live your life in Russia now, it’s a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">A: We had -- at that time, if you are talking about 1940, it was a matter of accepting wu -- one of two evils.</span> <span id="s1231">But this was not an evil, you know.</span> <span id="s1232">We functioned.</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">A: You know, we were able to, you know, to -- there was a little bit of a gray market, you know, and if there was a possibility to buy something and sell it -- even clothing, you know, that -- there used to be an open market, you know, it’s -- it was called pochawk.</span> <span id="s1235">But people were selling their own stuff to -- to improve on their living, because --</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">A: They didn’t earn enough.</span> <span id="s1238">These were war years, and they were difficult years, but not terrible years.</span> <span id="s1239">The terrible years were in Germany, and Poland, occupied by Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">A: And the real terrible years started in 1941, when they invaded Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">Q: So -- actually we don’t have that much time on the tape.</span> <span id="s1243">Cause I was going to ask you what that first one -- what that -- happened in June, in 1941.</span> <span id="s1244">So 1940 is going on, and in January you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">A: Of sort -- stabilizing itself.</span> <span id="s1246">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">A: Going -- of sort -- stabilizing itself.</span> <span id="s1248">In other words, as you mentioned before, I accepted the fact that I leave in a countr -- I live in a country where there’s a Communist regime, there’s no private enterprise, and you’ll need to -- we got to know them, and we got to know their weakness, and we used to laugh, you know how, you know they wear six watches, six wristwatches, you know, and -- and how corrupt they are, very corrupt, terribly corrupt system.</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">Q: And as a Jewish person, you’re feeling okay?</span> <span id="s1250">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1251">Qualified, but yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">Q: And what’s the qualification?</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">A: The qualification is that we knew that anti-Semitism in particular, you know, in the country, is strong, but we didn’t feel that we are being, you know, that we are in danger.</span> <span id="s1254">And mind you, this is in time when the entire -- when the -- the entire Jewish population that it crossed the border either legitimately remained, or was shipped to Siberia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">A: You know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">A: But we didn’t look at Siberia as a annihilation place, and it wasn’t.</span> <span id="s1259">Q: And it wasn’t, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">A: It wasn’t.</span> <span id="s1261">You know, people that went to Russia, inasmuch as Stalin was a terrible, terrible, you know, paranoiac brutal killer, you know, Jews were not mass murdered at that time.</span> <span id="s1262">They were shipped to Siberia to -- you know, to -- t -- to the slave labor camps, and what have you.</span> <span id="s1263">It was a difficult time, a bad time, but not a horrible time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">Q: Now, since there’s a certain kind of normalization because war is not yet upon you again, right, is -- are there theater groups, is there culture --</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">A: Very much so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">A: The cultural life in Lemberg was at it’s height.</span> <span id="s1268">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">A: Oh, tremendous.</span> <span id="s1270">And I must tell you, you know, they were terrible in, you know, equipping the army.</span> <span id="s1271">They were insane in slaughtering off their generals.</span> <span id="s1272">They slaughtered off -- between 1932 and 1940, they slaughtered off the best of generals that they had.</span> <span id="s1273">Marshall Bleecher, you know.</span> <span id="s1274">But in spite of this, in arts, opera, ballet, fantastic, fantastic.</span> <span id="s1275">Not good, fantastic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">Q: And were these inexpensive enough so you could go?</span> <span id="s1277">A: Very inexpensive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">A: Very inexpensive.</span> <span id="s1280">This was one thing.</span> <span id="s1281">Rent was pennies.</span> <span id="s1282">Radi -- television was pen -- Q: Theater, movies?</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">A: Streetcars, pennies, movies, theater.</span> <span id="s1284">Pennies.</span> <span id="s1285">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">A: This was all pennies.</span> <span id="s1287">Clothing you couldn’t get.</span> <span id="s1288">Shoes you couldn’t get.</span> <span id="s1289">But culture, tremendous.</span> <span id="s1290">I mean it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1292">No, no, no, it’s -- it sounds quite wonderful in [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">A: Well, it was exciting for young people, and this was the way young people said hey, so what is it?</span> <span id="s1294">And there were even those that said to me, why did you ever -- what was so special about your parents that you should have have everything, and we had to scrape to make it -- to -- to scratch together a living?</span> <span id="s1295">And it was an argument.</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">A: It was an argument.</span> <span id="s1298">But the Bund, the -- the -- the organization that, you know, developed, and educated, and united the -- the working masses of Poland, were considered enemies of germ -- of -- of Russia.</span> <span id="s1299">And the two leaders of the Bund organization were executed by the Soviets.</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">Q: Even though they’re pro-worker?</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">A: Pro-worker, but not Communists.</span> <span id="s1302">So what I’m trying to say to you is, it is very difficult in -- today, in normal life, to understand the abnormality of the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">A: On one hand I am telling you that I had a fantastic cultural life, and on the other hand, you know, they -- they soldiers were walking around with rags around their feet, because they didn’t have boots.</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">Q: And how do you understand this disparity?</span> <span id="s1306">Stupidity?</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">A: Stupidity.</span> <span id="s1308">We laughed about it.</span> <span id="s1309">Stupidity, perhaps the fact that it was poorly organized, very poorly organized.</span> <span id="s1310">Singing hallelujahs to -- to the party, and to Stalin, were so abnormal, so horrendous, so large, and -- and th -- that it -- it -- you could sense that it’s phony.</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1312">But it seem -- it seems -- the disparity seems so odd, to be able to organize, and have a whole cultural life for a population, and not be able to organize shoes, unless it was harder to get material.</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">A: No.</span> <span id="s1314">It was hard to get material, and people did everything possible to excel in the foy -- in -- in the field of ballet, athletics, because they got to a -- a -- a s -- a very special level.</span> <span id="s1315">The Soviet Union took care of those that they needed as a picture to the world.</span> <span id="s1316">Their athletes, their -- their singers, their opera singers, their actors.</span> <span id="s1317">You know, these were th- the ones that they show the world, we are a cultural society, and we are -- but we are availing this to the masses, where in your case, you have opera, you have theater, who goes there?</span> <span id="s1318">The wealthy.</span> <span id="s1319">The middle class at best.</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s1321">And this transforms something.</span> <span id="s1322">A: And they were not wrong with this argument.</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">Q: Yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">A: What they didn’t tell you is that, you know, these were the years where Stalin started already eliminating, you know, his opponents, and he was very paranoid about it, and he saw enemies in everybody and anybody.</span> <span id="s1325">And, you know, Trotsky was no longer in Russia, Trotsky -- Trotsky was killed already, in Mexico.</span> <span id="s1326">And th-they were the trials, the infamous trials in -- in Russia.</span> <span id="s1327">But this was in Moscow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1329">This wasn’t where you were.</span> <span id="s1330">Alright, I think we should take a break now, and the next tape we’ll start with June of 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">End of Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">Q: Miles, wer -- we’re gonna -- we’re gonna go to the war, June 1941 in a moment, but I wanted to just go back to your name for a moment, because I realized that this -- and there’s some noise -- at the start of the interview, I didn’t ask you the name with which you were born, which was Shmoil.</span> <span id="s1335">Can you just give us a sense of sort of a history of this change, from --</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">A: It’s th -- well, it’s a progression of changes.</span> <span id="s1337">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">A: It’s -- my Hebrew name is Shmoil.</span> <span id="s1339">The pet name for Shmoil is Shmeelek.</span> <span id="s1340">And then we dropped the s and it became Meelek.</span> <span id="s1341">And from Meelek, when I arrived in the United States, in Ellis Island, and I registered as Meelek, he ask me why don’t you make it Miles, and you’re gonna be famous, like Myles Standish.</span> <span id="s1342">I said, “You got a deal.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">Q: Myles Standish, huh?</span> <span id="s1344">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">A: I -- I think Myles Standish is with a y if I’m not mistaken.</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">Q: Yes, it is, that’s true, it’s different.</span> <span id="s1347">So he didn’t know how to spell.</span> <span id="s1348">A: Probably not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">Q: All right, thank you.</span> <span id="s1350">1941, June, the Germans attacked the Soviet Union, and the worst is about to come.</span> <span id="s1351">Where we -- where are you when the Germans attack?</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">A: I am with my mother in Lemberg, in Lvov, and the attack, it’s totally unexpected, and Lvov is stunned.</span> <span id="s1353">And within two days, within two days, the Germans were in Lvov.</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">Q: And is there much -- is there much fighting?</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">A: And there’s an awful lo -- well, to begin with, there was a lot of -- the order were to evacuate anything that you possibly could, including machinery.</span> <span id="s1356">It was three days, not two days.</span> <span id="s1357">And whole factories were loaded on trucks -- on trains, including the workers, and send into the depth of rud -- into deep Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1360">It was turmoil, it was fear, when they were moving so ferociously, and so, you know, w-with bombardments, as I explained to you before, and with heavy artillery, and then they were -- they entered Lvov without damaging anything, because the Poles did not oppo -- not the Poles, the -- the Soviets did not oppose, did not resist -- did not resist the entrance of the -- of the Germans.</span> <span id="s1361">And the Germans came in and Lvov is a city that will go down in infamy because the Ukrainian nationalists implemented the pogrom, and it was thousands of Jews that were taken from the street, from the houses, from offices, and taking them to the brigitky, which was the jail of -- the famous jail in Lvov, and slaughtered.</span> <span id="s1362">At that time, I was -- this -- this was -- I’m telling you something that’s three, four days already, but not [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1363">And I worked already, at that time, on the railroad, because the tracks from Lvov, deep into Russia were wider.</span> <span id="s1364">And from Lvov going westward, they were narrower.</span> <span id="s1365">So, wounded soldiers and -- and -- and equipment needed -- that needed to go westward were tran -- had to transferred from one to the other.</span> <span id="s1366">So the Wehrmacht, an officer came down, and he asked people to go to work, you know, and we figured going to work, it’s going to be the best thing.</span> <span id="s1367">So I -- I worked at that time already at the railroad, and I had a -- a document that I am essential to the efforts of the [indecipherable] the German army, and I should be left alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">Q: So this is within the first few days?</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">A: First few days, probably no -- no more than a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">Q: And the Ukrainian Nationalists came in within those first few days and rounded up -- A: The Ukrainian -- the Ukrainian Nationalists, first of all, Lvov is a city that is partially Polish and partially Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s1371">The vicinities for sure, you know, the agricultural vicinities for sure.</span> <span id="s1372">So the pogrom that the Ukrainians initiated was with the acquiescence, with the permission of the Germans, but not with the participation.</span> <span id="s1373">This was purely done by Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s1374">The Ukrainian police, volunteer police, and volunteers in general.</span> <span id="s1375">And I remember going back from work, and with a -- with a friend of mine who lived in -- in my building, Adonik was his name.</span> <span id="s1376">I don’t remember his last name.</span> <span id="s1377">And we were stopped by a Ukrainian, and he wanted us to take to -- to the brigitky, and it must have been an angel from heaven, a man, a -- a Ukrainian stopped, and he said, “These people have a -- a document that they are employed by the Wehrmacht, you have no right to touch them.”</span> <span id="s1378">So he let me go.</span> <span id="s1379">I would have been killed.</span> <span id="s1380">I am sure, if he would have taken me into the -- to the confines of the jail, I would have been killed like many, many others.</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1382">And they were rounding up Jews only ?</span> <span id="s1383">A: At random.</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">Q: At random?</span> <span id="s1385">Anybody?</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">A: At random, at random.</span> <span id="s1387">Jews, and political officers of the army if they could find them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">Q: And did you see this as an attack on people who they thought may have been working with the Russians?</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">Q: Or this was simply --</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">A: This was purely a pogrom.</span> <span id="s1392">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">A: This was purely a pogrom.</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">Q: And how long did this last [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">A: Four days, five days.</span> <span id="s1396">But it was terrible.</span> <span id="s1397">It was the first mass slaughter that I have experienced.</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">Q: So what did you see?</span> <span id="s1399">A: We didn’t see anything.</span> <span id="s1400">Q: It was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">A: We -- all we heard is, you know, the machine guns, you know, because the -- the brigitky, the -- the jail that I am talking about, were in center city.</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1403">So they would bring people there --</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">A: Into the yard, and into the interrogative itself, and I don’t know what was going on there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">All you heard is the machine guns.</span> <span id="s1406">And then, you know, th-they took Jews with open trucks, flat trucks, to take the -- the victims out to the cemetery to bury them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">Q: And did you see these trucks with dead bodies?</span> <span id="s1408">A: I did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">Q: You didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">A: I did not.</span> <span id="s1411">I was told about it -- Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">A: -- because when -- this experience shook me up, so I went in , we had in -- in the basement of our apartment building, each -- the each one, each tenant had a little apar -- a -- parted off a little, you know, a little -- it’s a warehouse, call it, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">Q: Storage -- for storage?</span> <span id="s1414">A: Storage.</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">A: And tha -- we had firewood there.</span> <span id="s1417">So I was terribly shaken up, so I went in there, and Mother built, from the firewood a false wall, you know, just with the openings for breathing, and you know, and I was there for about two or three days.</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">Q: Cause you really thought you would be -- that the paper would only protect you so much?</span> <span id="s1419">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">Q: And what’s happening to your mother?</span> <span id="s1421">Di -- did she not -- A: At that time, not.</span> <span id="s1422">At that time they were taking men only.</span> <span id="s1423">Q: Oh, men.</span> <span id="s1424">And primar -- excuse me -- primarily young men?</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1426">And of course, leaders -- leaders of the giminda, the -- the Jewish, you know, th-there was a -- inasmuch as the Soviet Union, there was a -- it was a cultural committee that were considered the giminda, because the giminda, you know, they’re liquidated when the Russians came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">Q: Was there anyone else hiding in this -- in this basement, where the storage, besides you?</span> <span id="s1428">A: Yes, there were others, but each one sat in his own --</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">Q: Place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">Q: And you didn’t speak, of course.</span> <span id="s1432">A: No, of course not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">Q: And did your mother come down and bring food?</span> <span id="s1434">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">Q: So what in heaven’s name were you thinking during these two or three days?</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">A: Terrible.</span> <span id="s1437">Terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible.</span> <span id="s1438">I was sorry that I didn’t take Mother, and we did not advance into Russia, although I didn’t know what happened to the people going into Russia, but I -- later on I -- I learned that most of the people, you know, they got to some places, in sibere -- Siberia, and you know, central Russia, because they needed, when they mobilized their manpower, they needed substitutes to work in the factories.</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">You see, all of it was not a matter of, you know, protection.</span> <span id="s1440">It was a matter of serving their needs, but their needs at that time were such that it helped, because the people were immediately employed, they immediately got bread, you know.</span> <span id="s1441">They -- they could eat, they -- they could exist.</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">Q: And the Russians were not going to shoot them.</span> <span id="s1443">That -- well, the point was not to shoot -- A: Right, right, the objective was not to shoot them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1444">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s1445">What made you not go off your mind in those few days?</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">A: I often wondered.</span> <span id="s1447">I often wondered, because the -- the first encounter, you know, with mass killings, was so horrible, I cannot begin to tell you.</span> <span id="s1448">It was outright frightening, and it’s no use being the hero.</span> <span id="s1449">I was frightened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">Q: Did it feel like the world was collapsing?</span> <span id="s1451">How does one under -- I mean it --</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">A: It felt that the dark days are coming up on the Jewish people, and it will go from bad to worse.</span> <span id="s1453">Still --</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">Q: Not mass murder.</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">A: I didn’t have the slightest idea what is waiting for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">Q: So what did you think when you were sitting there, if you were -- if you were doing this, contemplating what does it mean that the Germans are allowing the Ukrainians to grab people in the street and clearly killing them?</span> <span id="s1457">What does that -- what did that mean to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">A: When it happens -- Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">A: -- you are concentrated on -- Q: That.</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">A: -- on --</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">A: -- you know, on -- on what’s going on.</span> <span id="s1463">You are concentrated on that, as you would say.</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">You were not trying to rationalize, you were not trying to find rhymes or reasons whether that’s correct, or incorrect, whether it’s proper, or improper.</span> <span id="s1465">It’s almost like an animalistic feeling, of trying to protect itself, and trying to escape.</span> <span id="s1466">And your mind went blank.</span> <span id="s1467">I couldn’t tell you.</span> <span id="s1468">If you ask me how I reasoned, or -- I don’t remember it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1470">Did you sleep?</span> <span id="s1471">A: Too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">Q: During those few days, you did sleep?</span> <span id="s1473">Why do you say too much?</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">A: Because, th -- the sleep was a form of -- a form of -- of burying your pain.</span> <span id="s1475">Burying your fears.</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">Q: And you think you shouldn’t have done that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">A: I -- I don’t know what I should have done.</span> <span id="s1478">At that time there wasn’t much to do.</span> <span id="s1479">There was a need to -- we needed time to organize.</span> <span id="s1480">We needed time to even think in terms of resistance.</span> <span id="s1481">We needed time in terms -- people, for instance, that looked Aryan, you know, blonde with blue eyes, needed time to get Polish documents, needed time to find some kind Christians, you know, that would give you a hiding space.</span> <span id="s1482">It was all new.</span> <span id="s1483">It -- it came down like a -- a poneratseras.</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">Q: So what enabled you to leave this hiding place?</span> <span id="s1485">Your mother comes and says they’ve stopped, what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">A: That, yes.</span> <span id="s1487">That things are normalized, and you know, traffic is -- because th -- for the first few days there was no traffic.</span> <span id="s1488">The only things that you saw is you saw German military vehicles that were advancing forward.</span> <span id="s1489">You saw the Ukrainians, you know, trying to round up as many Jews as possible.</span> <span id="s1490">To tell you whether I knew how they went, whether they went by lists, or just at random, I couldn’t tell you that.</span> <span id="s1491">I know if they would have taken me, it would have been at random, because I was not politically active.</span> <span id="s1492">I was not, you know, a Communist -- a member of the Communist party, I was not a Communist leader, I was not a leader in my immediate vicinity.</span> <span id="s1493">So it wasn’t a d -- random thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1495">So you go back, and you’re living with your mother in the apartment.</span> <span id="s1496">A: Right, and keep working, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">Q: And you keep working in the railroad now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">Q: For the Wehrmacht?</span> <span id="s1500">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">Q: Do they pay you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">A: They paid very little, but the thing was that it was a good job, because they gave a piece of bread, a little marmalade, a little bit of artificial butter, you know, from --</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">Q: [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">A: -- so at -- as far as the job is concerned, in those days it was a good job.</span> <span id="s1505">Q: And your mother, how was she eating, what is she doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">A: Well, it -- I had a problem with Mother that no matter what -- for instance if I brought home some kielbasa, she wouldn’t touch it.</span> <span id="s1507">I can tell you that one day -- but she n-n-n -- knew that I need to eat, and I need to -- so I remember once coming into the house, and mother was, you know, with the fire at -- a fire hook, she was kind of poking under the stove.</span> <span id="s1508">I say, “Mom, can I help you, what are you looking for?”</span> <span id="s1509">So she was a little embarrassed to tell me, so I say, “Mom, what is it that you need, let me -- let me,” -- so finally I walked over, and I took the hook from her, and I started poking, and what do I pull out?</span> <span id="s1510">The kielbasa.</span> <span id="s1511">She would -- didn’t want to touch it with her hands, so she pushed it under the stove.</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">Q: And she was cooking it for you?</span> <span id="s1513">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">Q: But she wouldn’t eat it.</span> <span id="s1515">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">Q: No way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">A: Of course not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">Q: So then what did she eat, some bread?</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">A: Well, it -- it -- bread, it -- at that time, bread was given out, it was rationed, but they were giving bread, and we -- as I told you before, my job, you know, with the Russians, was a pretty good job, and I was able to save up some things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">A: So I went down to the market and bought something, you know, some greens, and some fruit, and you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">Q: So -- so currency didn’t cha -- how -- what currency were you using?</span> <span id="s1523">What were you getting from the Russians?</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">A: From the -- from the Russians?</span> <span id="s1525">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">A: Ruble.</span></p> <p><span id="s1527">Q: Rubles.</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">A: Ruble.</span> <span id="s1529">Rubles.</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">Q: So, the Germans come in -- A: Chervinsa.</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">Q: Chervinsa?</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1533">Q: And the Germans don’t change the currency, you can go down the -- A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s1534">Th-The -- immediately currency was new currency.</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">Q: So were you able to switch?</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">A: Wait a minute.</span> <span id="s1537">Let me go back for a moment.</span> <span id="s1538">I think that for a little while, the rubles were going on.</span> <span id="s1539">And then they gave a period that within 10 days, you can submit a mart -- maximum amount I think was 500, or 5000, I don’t remember any more.</span> <span id="s1540">But there was a process of exchanging this for new, local currency.</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">Q: And where were you keeping your money, in -- in the apartment under the mattress?</span> <span id="s1542">A: Somewhere under -- of course, not in a bank.</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">A: Not in a bank.</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">Q: And were you able to -- if you remembered, were you able to exchange most of he money that you had?</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">A: I remember -- I don’t remember details, but I remember that I somehow met a guy who was buying up these rubles.</span> <span id="s1547">Whether he was going into Russia, or whether he believed that the Russians are coming back, I couldn’t tell you.</span> <span id="s1548">But I know that I was able to dispose of it at a rate of exchange that was ridiculous, but I got currency that I could deal with.</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">A: Yeah, I want to tell you something, Joan.</span> <span id="s1551">It’s 50 years.</span> <span id="s1552">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">A: It’s getting hazy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1554">Q: Yes, but you have a lot of details, so if you can’t answer, at least the question’s on the table.</span> <span id="s1555">And you have a lot of details, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">Q: Yes, fine.</span> <span id="s1558">So you are working -- A: At the railroad.</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">Q: At the railroad station.</span> <span id="s1560">Is there -- do you see a kind of leveling off of brutality, or do you now begin to see rules for the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">A: No, no, we see a stabilization of sorts.</span> <span id="s1562">We didn’t know how it will go, but it was the Germans that appointed a Jewish leadership, a Judenrat, and they even created a Jewish militia, you know, just to keep order, no weapons, you know, and all what they did -- for instance, if they wanted -- if they -- if they ordained a random -- a -- a ra -- you know, a -- a policy -- if they wanted, for instance, large amounts of money, they went to the Judenrat and they gave them 48 hours to come up with it.</span> <span id="s1563">If not, they’ll kill hundreds of Jews.</span> <span id="s1564">This is one thing.</span> <span id="s1565">The other thing is that -- bear in mind that Lvov had several hundred thousand people.</span> <span id="s1566">There was a need to establish some kind of an order.</span> <span id="s1567">Even for killing, you needed an order.</span> <span id="s1568">Do you follow me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1570">A: So it was the Jewish Judenrat, and the Jewish militia, the Jewish police, that implemented that order.</span> <span id="s1571">Little did we know that these policemen will be forced later, to participate in, you know, in shipping off the Jews to the -- God knows where.</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">Q: Now, a ghetto was not formed immediately.</span> <span id="s1573">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">Q: It takes a number of -- A: Takes awhile.</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">Q: Takes a few months.</span> <span id="s1576">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1577">Q: So is the Judenrat and the militia formed before the Jew -- the ghetto is formed, or around the same time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">A: It is -- I don’t remember the details of it, but I can tell you that the location of it was very much in a densely Jewish area.</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">Q: I see, already.</span></p> <p><span id="s1580">A: You know, a rat -- the Rappaport, a Shlamitchla, you know, this was a densely Jewish area.</span> <span id="s1581">And this is where they established it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">Q: And that’s where you were living as well?</span> <span id="s1583">A: And that’s where I was living.</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">Q: Okay, so you didn’t -- when the ghetto is formed, which I think is November, December of ’41, is that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">A: At that time, I was already in a slave labor camp.</span> <span id="s1586">Q: Okay, so you are -- I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">A: I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1588">I know that they have kept constricting the ghetto area.</span> <span id="s1589">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">A: They -- first of all they established the ghetto, and they -- and the first one wasn’t so bad because they -- all they wanted is the perimeter around it to clean up, and of course people were given 48 hours, you know, and take what they can carry with them, and go in.</span> <span id="s1591">And there was a matter of getting these people located within the ghetto, you know.</span> <span id="s1592">And this was in the beginning, you know, people felt you are invading my privacy, this is my apartment.</span> <span id="s1593">So this is where the Judenrat and Jewish police, you know, played a very constructive role, you know.</span> <span id="s1594">Very constructive role, helping, you know, and -- and demanding from these people that they should make place.</span> <span id="s1595">That -- there were several rounds of constricting the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1596">I did not get to any of them, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">Q: So you’re out s -- much sooner, you’re -- A: I beg your pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">Q: You’re out of that situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">A: I -- what I recall is I recall the Germans coming in, the pogrom, this was something that I’ll never forget, it was a terrible, terrible thing, and it was thousands of Jews that were killed.</span> <span id="s1600">And what I do remember is the settling in, as you said, you know, things have settled in for awhile.</span> <span id="s1601">People had to go to work, they came in, for instance, the Germans organized an arbitesont.</span> <span id="s1602">That means a -- an unemployment office, where instead of going out and catching, you know, people, they send a message to the arbitesont that today we need 3,000 workers.</span> <span id="s1603">And the arbitesont had to, you know, supply them.</span> <span id="s1604">In the beginning, they were people that went there because at the end of the day they got a quarter of a pound of bre -- a pound of bread, you know.</span> <span id="s1605">So people needed to work, y -- to be able to -- t-to survive, and to get some bread, get some -- some fruit, get some vegetables.</span> <span id="s1606">And -- but what I’m -- you asked me the question, I do -- I did not live in Lvov any more when the first co -- for the second round-up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1608">So how does it happen that you’re taking -- taken to Viniki slave labor camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1609">What -- what happens?</span> <span id="s1610">You’re still working --</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">A: Still working on the -- on -- a -- on the railroad, and on the way home, there were SS men standing with Ukrainian police, with a truck, and stopped people, and -- and asked them for documents, for th -- th -- th -- a shine -- a -- a document.</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">A: And I was quite certain that document that I have is -- has -- carries the protection.</span> <span id="s1614">So when they asked for the document I gave it to him, so he tore it up, and he said, “Get on the truck.”</span> <span id="s1615">And within a half an hour, we were about 60 or 70 people, that were brought to Viniki.</span> <span id="s1616">Viniki was a -- had a small labor camp.</span> <span id="s1617">What they had is they had a gulag of labor camps spread between Lvov and Kiev, and the object of it was to build a better highway, to enable the advancement of the German mechanized forces.</span> <span id="s1618">So our job -- the Viniki group, our job was between Lvov and Viniki, to build a highway.</span> <span id="s1619">So the first s -- gravel that we got is they took us into the Jewish cemetery -- Lvov had a beautiful Jewish cemetery that was 200 or 250 years old, big magnificent, magnificent, you know, mausoleums.</span> <span id="s1620">Marble, you know, expensive marble.</span> <span id="s1621">And our job was to dismantle it, break it into -- into gravel, and load it up on trucks that were going for the building of the road between Lvov and -- and Kiev.</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">Q: That must have felt -- A: Oh, horrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">Q: -- horrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">A: Horrible.</span> <span id="s1625">In the process of doing it - -and I’m very proud of this, we got started organizing, and when it came to a very beautiful mausoleum, what we did is we dug the - - dug the -- the grave, put in the stones, and covered it with -- with dirt, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">Q: So you could protect it.</span> <span id="s1627">A: To protect it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">Q: And they didn’t see?</span></p> <p><span id="s1629">A: They didn’t see it, and we didn’t -- you know, very few of those that did it, survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s1630">Most of them got killed, sooner or later, because this is where the killing started, already.</span></p> <p><span id="s1631">Q: In that cemeter -- in -- a-as you were doing this work?</span> <span id="s1632">A: No, no, th --</span></p> <p><span id="s1633">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">A: They -- le-let me say this to you.</span> <span id="s1635">As they entered, they were always cases of individual killings, killing five people, six people.</span> <span id="s1636">But there was no -- this was not an annihilation process.</span> <span id="s1637">For the time being it was a punitive, or a process to scare them, to scare us, or a process to -- s -- th -- you know, force us to surrender gold, or to surrender money.</span> <span id="s1638">But it was not the implemented, final solution.</span> <span id="s1639">This came later.</span> <span id="s1640">This came, I would say in -- in the Lvov area, somewhere about a couple of months after the Germans came in.</span> <span id="s1641">In Barbiare, you know, when the Soviet -- when the German army -- when the not -- when the German army move forward, and they conquered Kiev.</span> <span id="s1642">In Barbiare there was already the first killing.</span> <span id="s1643">The Einsatzgruppen.</span> <span id="s1644">This was the beginning of the Einsatzgruppen.</span> <span id="s1645">But the Einsatzgruppen were only on the Soviet occupied territories.</span> <span id="s1646">In -- in the territories of former Poland, they were no mass -- at that time there were no mass killings.</span> <span id="s1647">Individual killings, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1648">Q: So whatever was formerly Poland --</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">Q: -- which was where Lemberg, or Lvov was -- A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1651">Q: -- that -- that -- it didn’t happen there?</span> <span id="s1652">A: Not -- not yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">Q: [indecipherable] not yet, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">A: N -- it was brutal, they were -- th-th -- you know, beating us, forcing us to work, and in some ca -- not in some, in many of cases, they made fun, you know, of us, and we had to -- they gave us toothbrushes to clean -- to clean a sidewalk, you know, and things like this.</span> <span id="s1655">They cut off the beards from religious people, but still no mass annihilation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">Killings, brutality, beating, cruelty, but no mass annihilation.</span> <span id="s1657">The mass annihilation came later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">Q: Miles, before you were taken on the truck to go to Viniki, w-were you in a situation where you have to wear the -- the white --</span></p> <p><span id="s1659">A: Oh yes, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1660">Q: -- the white armband with [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1661">A: A white band, a white armband with a Star of David.</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">Q: And that was a number of months that you wore them, do you think?</span> <span id="s1663">A: About three months, I would say.</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">Q: And what did that -- what did you feel when you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">A: Felt so littled -- so belittled.</span> <span id="s1666">So morally devastated, you know, to -- t -- first of all, you were no -- you were not a human being.</span> <span id="s1667">There were some SS men, they were not on assignment, they just walked, they walked the street, and if you walked on the sidewalk with them, you know, he hit you with -- you know, with -- you know, with his hand, or with a -- whatever he carried.</span> <span id="s1668">He -- “Du schwine,” you pig, “get off the sidewalk.”</span> <span id="s1669">So, you know, they -- we were treated in a terrible way.</span> <span id="s1670">Dehumanized, totally dehumanized, and this was the feeling, that we are -- there were many suicides, I -- I presume you know that.</span> <span id="s1671">In -- in Lvov, there were many, many suicides.</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s1674">Of people who just didn’t want to participate in it.</span> <span id="s1675">Didn’t want to be part of it.</span> <span id="s1676">Q: Even though there’s not mass killing, it just is too -- it’s too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1677">A: The d -- the degradation, the dehumanization.</span> <span id="s1678">The treating the people like animals.</span> <span id="s1679">But I had Mother at home, and she couldn’t work, she -- you know, she wasn’t cut out to work, she -- she -- at that time, and Mother was -- 19 -- 84 -- 16 -- 40 -- 56 - 55 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1680">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1681">A: You know, and whatever I -- you know, I could do to, you know, to bring home some food, and to protect her.</span> <span id="s1682">I had a girlfriend in Lvov, and she was wonderful, she did everything she could.</span> <span id="s1683">She was blonde, blue eyed, so sh -- sometimes she could smuggle, and go after, you know, the designated hours, y-you know, because Jews were not allowed to -- to be on the street after six o’clock in the evening.</span> <span id="s1684">So she -- when I was taken away to Viniki, she, for awhile, took care of Mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1685">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1686">A: And in a short while after that, it started, the mass annihilations started, and Beljets was opened, and they started emptying the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">Q: The ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1688">A: -- the ghetto in Lvov.</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">Q: Did your mother know you were in Viniki?</span> <span id="s1690">A: My mother knew that I was in Viniki.</span></p> <p><span id="s1691">Q: How did she find out, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">A: I was working on the road -- I told you we were working on the -- the -- first of all on the cemetery, and then I -- we started working on the roads, you know, the gulag that was set up.</span> <span id="s1693">And a guy that I knew, he was a friend of the parents of my girlfriend -- and I asked him, I said, “Do me a favor and go to Lucia and tell her that I am in Viniki.”</span> <span id="s1694">So from him, Lucia, my girlfriend learned it, and she told Mother.</span> <span id="s1695">And about six weeks later, they started the first shipments to Beljets, and I don’t know whether it was the first or the second shipment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1696">Q: Uh-huh, that she was on.</span> <span id="s1697">And did Lucia go on that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1698">A: No, Lucia survived, and she came without an armband, with this guy, and she told me Mother was taken away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1699">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s1700">That must have been just -- A: It was horrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1701">Q: And by then did you know what it meant?</span> <span id="s1702">A: By then we knew it.</span> <span id="s1703">B --</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">Q: You did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">A: B-By then we suspected, and -- and still I want to tell you that everybody hoped that he will -- he will survive.</span> <span id="s1706">Somehow he will survive.</span> <span id="s1707">This desire of human beings, you know, to evade the worst, it’s unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">Q: Now, Lucia was able, because she could pass, to come to Viniki?</span></p> <p><span id="s1709">A: Yeah, but I have learned later that she was apprehended, and she was taken to slave labor camp of Janofska.</span></p> <p><span id="s1710">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1711">Oh.</span> <span id="s1712">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1713">A: Yanofs -- do you know about Janofska?</span> <span id="s1714">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1715">A: Janofska was a very, very cruel camp, a soflager, and most of the Jews fr-from Lemberg went either to the death camp of Beljets, or to Janofska.</span></p> <p><span id="s1716">Q: So in some strange way, you were fortunate to be in this work -- this gulag rather than Janofska [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1717">A: Well, I was fortunate because, you know, being there, you know, they -- they didn’t -- this was the time where they didn’t empty labor -- labor camp.</span> <span id="s1718">This was a slave labor camp, this was not a killing camp.</span> <span id="s1719">However, when typhoid broke out in our camp, and when people started getting high fever, every morning he used to come in, the SS man -- what was his name, I don’t -- I -- I can see him, but I don’t remember his name.</span> <span id="s1720">H-He -- Hegler?</span> <span id="s1721">Something like it.</span> <span id="s1722">And everyone who had fever, and -- he asked the guys to load them up on a -- a -- a -- it was like a -- a pushcart, but with soft tires.</span> <span id="s1723">And he shot them, and they took them out to bury them.</span> <span id="s1724">And the camp -- aga -- even in camp, there was a time where [indecipherable] to regulate itself, to settle down, because I often wonder whether it wouldn’t have been much better if we would have kept them in turmoil.</span> <span id="s1725">I often wonder that.</span> <span id="s1726">And yes, a good many would have been killed, a good many would have been maimed, but in turmoil, when 200 people are working with 10 policemen, and they disperse, some would have been saved.</span> <span id="s1727">And wise -- why human nature is such to submit, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1728">Q: It’s hard to organize turmoil.</span></p> <p><span id="s1729">A: It’s ha-hard to organize turmoil, exactly.</span> <span id="s1730">Exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1731">Q: So, are you living, when you’re not working, in a barrack of some kind?</span></p> <p><span id="s1732">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1733">Barracks with the same bank -- th -- the bunkbeds like you see in -- in -- in Auschwitz, and we had Ukrainian police -- there were three SS men, and the rest were Ukrainian police, and they took us to work every morning, and we had to go, and march and sing, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1734">Q: Sing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1735">A: Oh yes, all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">Q: What were you have -- what did you have to sing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1737">A: German -- German songs.</span> <span id="s1738">Or they used to, you know, make up songs that they were in German, but, -- you know about us, that the Jews are the fault of the war, and the Jews caused the war, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1739">Q: And you had to sing them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1740">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s1741">Always when we went to work we had to sing, and if not, they were terrible, they asked us to run, to drop, to get up, to -- in particular when it was rainy, when it was muddy.</span> <span id="s1742">Terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1743">Q: And what clothes do you have?</span> <span id="s1744">You have the clothes when they took you out [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1745">A: Our clothes, we did -- Q: That’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1746">A: -- we didn’t have stripers.</span> <span id="s1747">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">A: We did not --</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">Q: So the same clothes that you came in with?</span></p> <p><span id="s1750">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1751">Same clothes, and the clothes of those that were killed, or died, because you know, not all of them.</span> <span id="s1752">What I want to point out to you is that in camp, in Viniki, which was a slave labor camp, the difference between the poor in the villages, and the kids of -- th-the kids or parents of wealthy families, was that the wealthy and the city people died first.</span></p> <p><span id="s1753">They couldn’t -- they -- they were soft.</span> <span id="s1754">You know what I mean when I -- you know what I mean when I say they were soft?</span></p> <p><span id="s1755">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1756">A: The villagers, and the poor people were more ardent.</span> <span id="s1757">They were more used to hunger, they were more used to filth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1758">Q: It’s an interesting oddity, isn’t it -- A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1759">Q: -- that when pressed, and when things get worse -- A: Right, a-absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1760">Q: -- they have a -- a way of surviving.</span></p> <p><span id="s1761">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1762">They -- their -- their -- their level of resistance was higher.</span> <span id="s1763">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1764">So who are you in that circumstance?</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">A: I -- in between.</span></p> <p><span id="s1766">Q: You’re both a city boy, and be -- A: In between, in between, but young.</span> <span id="s1767">Q: Yes, you’re 21, or 20 --</span></p> <p><span id="s1768">A: 21, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1769">Q: 21 years old in Viniki, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1770">A: And I knew at that time that Mother is gone.</span> <span id="s1771">I didn’t hear from Lucia, so I assume she is either in a camp somewhere, or gone, and then I found out that she is in -- she was in Auschwit -- in Janofska.</span></p> <p><span id="s1772">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1773">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1774">A: And then I lost trace of her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1775">Q: So what -- do you have friends there, in the camp?</span> <span id="s1776">A: Oh, we formed friends, yeah, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1777">Q: You formed friendships.</span></p> <p><span id="s1778">A: As a matter of fact, this is the camp, you know, if you remember, you know, we were preparing an escape, and the elders of the camp called us, and asked us, “Who gives you the right to buy your own freedom at the price of those that will be killed, who will not be able to escape?”</span> <span id="s1779">This is the camp Viniki, this is where it transpired.</span></p> <p><span id="s1780">Q: Viniki.</span> <span id="s1781">Now, explain something to me, you say they’re elders of the camp.</span> <span id="s1782">Now is that something that the Germans constructed, or it just happened to be --</span></p> <p><span id="s1783">A: Just there were some people -- Q: They were -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1784">A: -- that they naturally were considered, you know -- I remember there was a professor of the University of Lvov.</span> <span id="s1785">There was a former textile manufacturer.</span> <span id="s1786">You know, people of statue and respect, and not youngsters, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1787">Q: And how did these --</span></p> <p><span id="s1788">A: It’s a self evolved leadership, so to say.</span></p> <p><span id="s1789">Q: Okay, now, how did they find out?</span> <span id="s1790">Somebody goes and says there’s these young guys here --</span></p> <p><span id="s1791">A: We were -- we -- we started up with a few, three, four that we started talking about it, and we realized that we are going to do it, that we need about 25 or 30, assuming that if it doesn’t work when we disperse, and a third will get killed, half will get killed, and half will survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1792">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1793">A: So, there are no secrets, you know, in particular between young people who have been incarcerated, and you know.</span> <span id="s1794">So i-it became known that a -- a group -- they didn’t know who, that a group is planning an escape.</span> <span id="s1795">And then the elders started looking into it, and they found out who the group was, and they summoned us at night, when everybody was asleep, to come and talk to them, and we came, and the question was very simple, you have no right to buy your freedom at the price of others.</span> <span id="s1796">And we recognize that they have a point, and we listen to them.</span> <span id="s1797">And it wa --</span></p> <p><span id="s1798">Q: You did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1799">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1800">And it was a wrong thing to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1801">Q: And you -- and you said that to them, that it was wrong to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1802">A: No, we -- we -- w -- when they said it to us, they said go home and think about it.</span> <span id="s1803">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1804">A: But when we talk about it, and when we talked with each other, we said they -- these -- they are right.</span> <span id="s1805">Maybe --</span></p> <p><span id="s1806">Q: They are right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1807">A: Yeah, 30 will escape, but we were about 200 people there.</span> <span id="s1808">The rest will get killed.</span> <span id="s1809">So we decided not to do it, and it was mistake, it was a terrible mistake, because two or three months later, that was the end of Viniki.</span></p> <p><span id="s1810">Q: Was it clear at that time that the Germans would take an escape out on the rest of the population, if you actually -- let’s say -- that -- that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1811">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1812">One of the things that they have established from the beginning, is that mass retribution for single disobedience of a single resistance, of stealing something, stealing some food, or something, always mass retribution.</span> <span id="s1813">This was a common thing.</span> <span id="s1814">In camp also, mass retribution, all the time.</span> <span id="s1815">But in that time, what I am talking to you about, this was probably in the beginning of ’42, that i -- the cemetery was emptied already, and we ran -- they moved us down, like a hun -- a hundred -- we finished a hundred feet, move to the next hundred feet.</span> <span id="s1816">Finish a thousand feet, move to the next -- at that time I was assigned a job to roll -- to ride a steamroller.</span> <span id="s1817">You know what I am talking about?</span> <span id="s1818">The steamroller that presses gravel --</span></p> <p><span id="s1819">Q: The gravel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1820">A: -- into space.</span> <span id="s1821">And I was the only one of the entire camp that was allowed at night to remain un -- with the steamroller, because I had to protect it.</span> <span id="s1822">Everybody else went to camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1823">Q: Went back to camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1824">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1825">And this -- Q: So you’re alone?</span></p> <p><span id="s1826">A: Alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1827">Q: With the steamroller?</span> <span id="s1828">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1829">Q: You and the steamroller?</span></p> <p><span id="s1830">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1831">But I’ll tell you, it -- it -- good things came of it, because when they started -- when they started transporting Jews to the death camps of Lvov, and you know, and -- and -- of Beljets, and -- and -- and other camps, some people broke the little windows in the boxcars open, and threw children out, or youngsters got out.</span> <span id="s1832">So quite often, people knocked on the door, and specifically I remember th -- a fellow that later became one of the best partisans, one of the best sharpshooters that we had, Moishe Lot, he died three years ago.</span> <span id="s1833">He came, knocked to the door, he was stark naked, stark naked.</span> <span id="s1834">He said, “Let me in, I am very cold, and I want to go in with you tomorrow to work.”</span> <span id="s1835">So I took him in, I gave him something to eat, he warmed up, and I gave him some clothing, and in the morning he blended in with the group, and went to camp.</span> <span id="s1836">Went to camp because he had no place to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1837">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1838">A: He had to smuggle into -- to the labor -- Q: Into the slave labor camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1839">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1840">I remember a girl who knocked at the door another night, and it was -- she must have been 17 - 16 years old, beautiful girl.</span> <span id="s1841">And she was dressed.</span> <span id="s1842">And she said mother threw her out of the -- of the boxcar.</span> <span id="s1843">And I asked her whether she knew where the boxcar got, she said, “Yes, we knew that we are going -- we are being taken somewhere to a -- a fa -- a faniktudslager, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1844">Q: And she knew that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1845">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1846">And she again wanted to go into camp, but I said, “Look, you don’t look like Jewish, try to maybe smuggle.”</span> <span id="s1847">She said, “I’m tired of it.</span> <span id="s1848">I’ll go into the camp, and whatever will happen, will happen.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1849">Q: So there were men as well as women in this camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1850">A: In our camp there was a very small group of women, and they were mostly in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s1851">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1852">A: Oh, maybe 15 - 20 women.</span> <span id="s1853">Q: Out of the 200 or so people?</span> <span id="s1854">A: Yeah, maybe less.</span></p> <p><span id="s1855">Q: So was she able to -- to go in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1856">A: She smuggled in, yes.</span> <span id="s1857">But bear in mind that very few of us survived.</span> <span id="s1858">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1859">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1860">A: You know, the only ones that survive is the ones that found a way of breaking out from camp, and the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1861">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1862">A: You know, as I the -- the -- the people that were in camp, were assigned to work positions.</span> <span id="s1863">When I was finished [indecipherable] an area, I had to go back to camp, and you know, be in the quarry.</span> <span id="s1864">So one day in the quarry, we were working, we must have been 70 or 80 people, guarded by Ukrainian police.</span> <span id="s1865">Two Ukrainian police needed a handful of people to go further out in the quarry to look for harder -- a harder stone, because some of the stone was of a calcium composition, and some of it was like marble.</span> <span id="s1866">So we were four people -- five people, and we were taken by two policemen deep into the quarry to -- to dig some of that hard stone.</span> <span id="s1867">And we -- by eyesight we communicated, you know, and at one point, we jumped them, and we killed them, and we got away with a rifle and a half, one rifle intact, and the other one broken.</span> <span id="s1868">But we were able to -- to fix it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1869">Q: How was he killed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1870">A: With shovels and picks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1871">Q: Real -- all of you just bashed him --</span></p> <p><span id="s1872">A: Yeah, the two -- yeah, w-we jumped on one and the other, you know, because they were grabbing the rifles, but by the time they were able to grab the rifle and position it, you know, we attacked them with picks and shovels.</span></p> <p><span id="s1873">Q: Is this something that you had, in some way, talked about?</span> <span id="s1874">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1875">Q: No, you just looked at each other, this was an opportunity.</span></p> <p><span id="s1876">A: Oh -- oh, this was at a time when we started getting news that there are people that are running into the woods.</span></p> <p><span id="s1877">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1878">A: We didn’t know who, we didn’t know where, but all we heard is that people are escaping from camp, and going into the woods, they are going to organize themselves.</span> <span id="s1879">So when we killed them, we didn’t know the area.</span> <span id="s1880">I told you before about the villagers, and the city people?</span> <span id="s1881">The villagers were fortunate because they knew the forest, they knew the area.</span></p> <p><span id="s1882">We were fortunate that one of the five was -- Moatcha Stralliska, you know, was a -- a -- a village -- a -- a -- a peasant -- a village boy.</span> <span id="s1883">And he knew the area.</span> <span id="s1884">And we escaped, and we -- in daytime we got into the field, it was -- where we lay in the -- you know, in between the stands of -- you know, wheat and corn, whatever was growing there.</span> <span id="s1885">And at night we got into the woods.</span> <span id="s1886">We didn’t know anybody, we didn’t know where to go.</span> <span id="s1887">But slowly, you know, you’re going -- we discovered that there are some Jews here, there’s some Jews there.</span> <span id="s1888">Within a period of six to eight weeks, we were around 200 - 250 people, various ages.</span> <span id="s1889">Some women, some children.</span> <span id="s1890">So what we did is we separated the young, the ones that were able to fight, and we -- and we had with us, you know, the -- the -- we called it, you know, the -- the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1891">The elderly people, the children, you know, the drek commando we called it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1892">Q: Drek?</span></p> <p><span id="s1893">A: Commando.</span></p> <p><span id="s1894">Q: The drek commando, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1895">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1896">But we kept them, we kept them in food, and we kept them safe.</span> <span id="s1897">Q: And these were people who had escaped from the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1898">A: Escaped from the ghetto, some of them escaped from a hiding place.</span> <span id="s1899">Some of them escaped, you know, from camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1900">Q: Camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1901">A: All kinds of things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1902">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1903">And this was just happenstance, that you began to find each other?</span> <span id="s1904">A: Pure coincidence.</span></p> <p><span id="s1905">Q: And you were, in the beginning, five guys?</span></p> <p><span id="s1906">A: We started -- we were th -- when we came in, as five.</span> <span id="s1907">Q: [indecipherable] these guys.</span></p> <p><span id="s1908">A: But there were already people in the forest.</span></p> <p><span id="s1909">Q: Now, I want to a -- bef -- I -- I -- I want to obviously get into the details of that, but I want to go back to something.</span> <span id="s1910">When those elders call you together, is that two or three months before your actual escape?</span></p> <p><span id="s1911">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1912">Q: And why did you say that at that moment it was stupid that you listened to them?</span> <span id="s1913">Why was it so stupid?</span></p> <p><span id="s1914">A: Because if we wouldn’t have listened to them -- Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1915">A: -- if we wouldn’t have listened to them, we -- about 30, or maybe 40 would have either escaped not being noticed, or would have escaped, and would have been noticed and shot at, and some would have been killed, but the rest would have survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s1916">Q: So you’re saying a larger group would have gotten out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1917">A: Right, right.</span> <span id="s1918">This is all, you know, if and when and if and when.</span> <span id="s1919">But the fact is that the people that were in this camp, sooner or later, were transferred to Janofska or to Auschwitz, and were killed.</span> <span id="s1920">Or to any of the death camps, Treblinka, to Sobibor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1921">Q: The five -- the five boys of you who did escape, were these five also part of the 20 or 30 who had been thinking about it earlier?</span></p> <p><span id="s1922">A: No, not all of them, one.</span> <span id="s1923">One was them.</span> <span id="s1924">Because bear in mind, I told you before that we moved a hundred feet, a thousand feet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1925">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1926">A: You know, at one point we caught up with a -- with a group from the -- from Kroshenko, from another gulag.</span></p> <p><span id="s1927">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1928">A: When I say gulag, I’m talking about af -- a -- a labor force, established, you know, to handle a stretch of the road.</span> <span id="s1929">So at that time, w-we have met with another group.</span> <span id="s1930">Am I clear?</span></p> <p><span id="s1931">Q: Yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1932">A: This was Kroshenko.</span> <span id="s1933">And the forests that we were in were called the Hanachofsky Lassiter Hanachova forest.</span></p> <p><span id="s1934">Q: Forest.</span></p> <p><span id="s1935">A: [indecipherable] Hanachov.</span></p> <p><span id="s1936">Q: Now this is not an area, of course, that you’re familiar with, only one guy of your -- the fu --</span></p> <p><span id="s1937">A: Yeah, but there were others later, when we started grouping together.</span> <span id="s1938">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1939">A: Most of the escapees were people that knew the area.</span> <span id="s1940">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1941">A: They knew some peasants, they were hoping that they will go in, and perhaps the peasant will help him, maybe he’ll hide him, maybe he’ll give him some food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1942">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1943">A: You know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1944">Q: Now, let me ask you something, that circumstance of jumping the two guards and killing them, you have been in a situation of being brutalized now, for a couple of years.</span> <span id="s1945">Not -- and you’ve watched brutality.</span> <span id="s1946">You yourself have never killed anyone, or been in a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1947">A: This was the first time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1948">Q: This was the first time.</span> <span id="s1949">What -- what happened to you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1950">A: It felt good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1951">Q: It felt good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1952">A: Felt good, let me not tell you anything else, it felt very good, it felt very good.</span> <span id="s1953">Q: And did you all have the same -- do you think --</span></p> <p><span id="s1954">A: I can only tell you how I felt.</span> <span id="s1955">I believe so.</span> <span id="s1956">I believe so, because we were bitter, we were mistreated, we were innocent, our families were murdered.</span> <span id="s1957">We were on the brink of being murdered, there was no law protecting us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1958">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1959">A: Nothing.</span> <span id="s1960">Everything was against us, the law was against us, the -- the -- the government was against us, you know.</span> <span id="s1961">Everybody was against us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1962">Q: And did you feel that you had crossed a line in terms of being able to do things you hadn’t done before because of --</span></p> <p><span id="s1963">A: I don’t think that we were philosophizing.</span> <span id="s1964">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1965">A: We didn’t have time for that.</span> <span id="s1966">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1967">A: We were hunted, and you know, we had to do everything possible to protect ourselves, and we started organizing, I told you, weapons was a major problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s1968">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1969">A: You know, the -- we -- it was very difficult to get weapons, it was dangerous to get weapons, and when you got them, you had to pay horrendous prices for it.</span> <span id="s1970">We were not strong enough yet to -- later on it was different, because we used to go into a village where German -- the German sup -- food supplies were stored.</span> <span id="s1971">And we took what we wanted, killed the -- the two or three policemen that were there, four the most, and burned the rest of the -- poured gasoline on the top of the sugar, and -- and the flour.</span> <span id="s1972">But later on we got smarter.</span> <span id="s1973">We took as much as we could, and we traded it with the peasants.</span> <span id="s1974">The peasants had weapons.</span> <span id="s1975">The peasants -- you know, when the Russians were treated, or the Poles were treated, they buried rifles, and -- and you know, hand grenades.</span> <span id="s1976">So we dealt with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1977">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1978">A: We traded.</span></p> <p><span id="s1979">Q: So let’s go back to the beginning.</span> <span id="s1980">It takes you about five or six weeks, yes?</span> <span id="s1981">To get together --</span></p> <p><span id="s1982">A: To get organized.</span></p> <p><span id="s1983">Q: Get organized.</span> <span id="s1984">So how are you -- what’s happening?</span> <span id="s1985">Are you walking in the nighttime and sleeping during the day so you’re not seen?</span> <span id="s1986">Or you walk whenever you can?</span></p> <p><span id="s1987">A: In the forest -- in the for -- the Germans did not go into the forest.</span> <span id="s1988">Q: Oh, that’s what I was wondering.</span></p> <p><span id="s1989">A: They did not go into the forest.</span> <span id="s1990">If they -- there were several times when they made round- ups.</span> <span id="s1991">So what they did is they enc -- encircled a certain area, and bombarded it heavily with artillery.</span> <span id="s1992">Or send in Ukrainians, but they themselves very seldom went into the forest, and when they went in, they didn’t come out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1993">Q: So that’s why they didn’t go in.</span> <span id="s1994">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1995">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1996">A: However, there were Ukrainian Nationalists, the -- the -- we called them banderofsa, from Bandera.</span> <span id="s1997">They were much more dangerous than the Germans, because they knew the forest better than we did.</span> <span id="s1998">And they were well -- well armed, they were well equipped.</span> <span id="s1999">They knew the forests, and the most important thing, if any one of them got injured, all they needed to do was to bring him back, and put him into any peasant, and the peasant would take them.</span> <span id="s2000">With us, if somebody got injured, you know, unless the -- we -- we knew that the -- the peasant is trustworthy, we couldn’t -- we had to keep him with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2001">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2002">A: And medicine was a big problem.</span> <span id="s2003">Medicine and weapons was the biggest problem, not food.</span></p> <p><span id="s2004">Q: I was going to ask, not food?</span></p> <p><span id="s2005">A: No, because food -- we -- we were robbing.</span> <span id="s2006">We went into a village, and you know -- and we told them that we are confiscating.</span> <span id="s2007">You have three cows, we’ll take one.</span> <span id="s2008">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s2009">Q: That was good of you, you left two.</span> <span id="s2010">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2011">Q: And you took one.</span> <span id="s2012">A: No --</span></p> <p><span id="s2013">Q: So you would take a cow?</span> <span id="s2014">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2015">Q: And then kill the cow and take [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2016">A: Sure, sure, sure.</span> <span id="s2017">But as time went on, we became bolder, you know.</span> <span id="s2018">I am not telling you that we engaged the German Wehrmacht in open warfare because this is ridiculous.</span> <span id="s2019">We were not equipped for it, and we were not cut out for it, and it wasn’t called for.</span> <span id="s2020">But, as time went on, you know, we -- as I told you how we got -- you know, we surrounded their food depots.</span> <span id="s2021">You know, when we needed clothing, we went in, you know, to wealthy peasants and we got what we wanted.</span> <span id="s2022">Normally we did this about 20 - 30 miles away from where we stayed, because it was dangerous to do that.</span> <span id="s2023">We lived by the power of our -- of our weapons.</span> <span id="s2024">What we did, for instance, is, you know, we made sure that the surrounding area has a misconception of how big we are, and how strong we are.</span> <span id="s2025">We used to place a few people in various parts of the woods, and ask him to relieve salvos.</span> <span id="s2026">And the news in the for -- in the villages was that the partisans are occupying the entire forest, and they have thousands of people there, you know, fully equipped.</span> <span id="s2027">You know, to misinform them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2028">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2029">A: We used to go down, and we had some peasants that we trusted, and this is where we kee -- kept our wounded.</span> <span id="s2030">But medicine was a big problem.</span> <span id="s2031">And these were the days when penicillin were not known yet.</span> <span id="s2032">So the biggest item was iodine.</span> <span id="s2033">And we used to use -- as runnners, we used to use little girls.</span> <span id="s2034">You know, 12 years old, 14 years old, they were fabulous.</span> <span id="s2035">One of our girls was caught outside of Lvov with two liters of iodine.</span> <span id="s2036">Now, when the police saw a girl with two liters of iodine, they knew that she is from a partisan group.</span> <span id="s2037">And they promised her that they will take her to her parents, and they will -- they gave her clothing, and they’ll give her food, and this, to -- to reveal where we are, and she refused.</span> <span id="s2038">So they started torturing her.</span> <span id="s2039">She refused.</span> <span id="s2040">They finally killed her.</span> <span id="s2041">So ya --</span></p> <p><span id="s2042">Q: We need to stop the tape.</span> <span id="s2043">Hold -- hold that thought.</span> <span id="s2044">End of Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s2045">Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s2046">Q: We ended the last tape with you talking about the young 12 year old girl whose name was Leah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2047">A: I think so --</span></p> <p><span id="s2048">Q: And -- yes, you think it was Leah?</span></p> <p><span id="s2049">A: -- I think it was Leah, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s2050">Q: And she was caught --</span></p> <p><span id="s2051">A: With two liters of di -- iodine.</span> <span id="s2052">And they tried to interrogate her, and promise her all kinds of things, and finally -- she didn’t reveal where we are, and finally they started torturing her, and they tortured her to death.</span> <span id="s2053">But what I want to tell you is that the role of women in the underground was very necessary, and very important.</span> <span id="s2054">Because first of all, if you -- if we needed to make contact with someone about negotiating a purchase of weapons, or about getting some medicine, or about getting, you know, someone who is very sick into a hospital, you know, we needed women to do that, because men were circumcised.</span> <span id="s2055">If a man was caught in town, all they needed to do is ask him to drop his pants, and they knew that they have a Jew.</span> <span id="s2056">Now, people like Leah, people blend -- in particular blonde women, blue eyed women, well there were many of them, you know, and spoke a good peasant Polish, or Ukrainian, you know, were precious because they could do these things that -- much easier.</span> <span id="s2057">So they played a very, very important role, and with -- you know, being on guard at night -- they were on guard at night.</span> <span id="s2058">I -- I have nothing but admiration for the con -- conduct of women at, you know, during the partisan years.</span></p> <p><span id="s2059">Q: How did you find out that this happened to Leah?</span> <span id="s2060">How did the information get back to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2061">A: That she was caught?</span> <span id="s2062">Q: And -- and killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2063">A: She was caught outside of Lvov, that was a small village.</span> <span id="s2064">And in the village, that, you know, the people knew that, you know, the do -- the Ukrainians -- the -- the policemen were either local, or they grew into the community.</span> <span id="s2065">So, you know, the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2066">Q: So people knew it was [indecipherable] A: Of course, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s2067">Q: So e-explain to m -- explain to me if you can -- I-I -- I know that this -- this is a process, so it’s a little bit difficult to explain it, ha -- the kind of structure that you have, once you have these two or three hundred people, there are children, there are women, there are elderly.</span> <span id="s2068">There are young -- young, strong women, young men --</span></p> <p><span id="s2069">A: Okay, there was a fighting force, and that’s a big word.</span> <span id="s2070">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2071">A: You know, I don’t want you to come away from here is that we commanded, you know, an air force, and tanks, and -- this was not the case.</span> <span id="s2072">We had an antiquated weapons, with a meager amount of ammunition, every bullet counted, every hand grenade that you had, you were not sure whether when you will throw it, whether it will explode or not, you know, and -- but slowly, slowly, we started coo -- you know, i-invading small police outposts and villages.</span></p> <p><span id="s2073">Q: But wait a minute, wait a minute.</span> <span id="s2074">I want to go back a little bit.</span> <span id="s2075">If you have two or 300 hundred people, this --</span></p> <p><span id="s2076">A: Okay, all -- all --</span></p> <p><span id="s2077">Q: -- league of fighting force is like what, 50 guys?</span> <span id="s2078">A: Of sorts.</span></p> <p><span id="s2079">Q: No women.</span> <span id="s2080">No women are going to be shooting.</span> <span id="s2081">Is that --</span></p> <p><span id="s2082">A: No, women were -- were not -- women were used as runners.</span> <span id="s2083">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2084">A: Women were used as nurses.</span> <span id="s2085">Women were used as -- you know, mending clothes and stuff like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s2086">Q: Mm-hm, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2087">A: No -- no shooting.</span> <span id="s2088">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2089">A: But for guards at night, if we come back -- came back, and we were tired, and we wanted to lie down to sleep, they -- they were guards.</span> <span id="s2090">They --</span></p> <p><span id="s2091">Q: With guns?</span></p> <p><span id="s2092">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2093">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2094">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2095">Q: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s2096">A: Not all of them.</span> <span id="s2097">There is -- she just died, Hannah Hochberg.</span> <span id="s2098">She was a tremendous, tremen -- oh, we made a mistake, we should have had her with us in the fighting force.</span></p> <p><span id="s2099">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2100">A: She was a dynamo, a dynamo.</span> <span id="s2101">And she always argued don -- don’t -- just because, you know, we are different sex, doesn’t mean that, you know, we cannot participate, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s2102">Q: So there were arguments in the group between the men -- the women wanted -- A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s2103">Q: -- the women wanting to fight.</span></p> <p><span id="s2104">A: Absolutely, and some of them did.</span> <span id="s2105">Q: And s -- and some of them did?</span></p> <p><span id="s2106">A: Not in our --</span></p> <p><span id="s2107">Q: Right, yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s2108">A: Not the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2109">Q: -- in other groups.</span> <span id="s2110">A: In other groups.</span></p> <p><span id="s2111">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2112">A: You know.</span> <span id="s2113">So what I’m saying to you is, you ask me did -- di -- the division up, the elderly people, the women, the children.</span> <span id="s2114">We call them the ghetto, or the -- the drek commando, you know.</span> <span id="s2115">They were wonderful people.</span> <span id="s2116">They were our -- our uncles, our aunts, our -- not my uncles, but there were parents there, you know.</span> <span id="s2117">So our job was too keep them with food, you know, and with supplies.</span> <span id="s2118">Now, if there was a case where we learned that Germans are trying to surrounder us and what have you, we moved them out first.</span> <span id="s2119">And they were difficult because they couldn’t move as rapidly.</span></p> <p><span id="s2120">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2121">A: You know, but we moved them.</span> <span id="s2122">We never abandoned them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2123">Q: And that put you all in a -- it was a more difficult group to be in if you had --</span></p> <p><span id="s2124">A: Absolutely -- absolutely.</span> <span id="s2125">And then there’s another thing that you have to bear in mind.</span> <span id="s2126">Having weapons was the most important thing.</span> <span id="s2127">People came out of the ghettos, a good many of them came -- came with their s -- wi -- with their shirt on their back.</span></p> <p><span id="s2128">Q: Uh-huh, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2129">A: And there were camps, there were partisan units that did not accept people without weapons.</span> <span id="s2130">There were partisan units that unfortunately came with weapons, but before they reached us, you know, there were Ukrainian units that intercepted them, took their weapons and killed them.</span> <span id="s2131">We were in good working relationship with the akar, with the armia kryova, with the Polish akar, and the reason for it is because this was an area where before the war Poles were considered colonizers, you know, occupants, you know, that they were sent in by the Polish government to Polonize the area.</span> <span id="s2132">And the Ukrainians ha- hated them, and the Ukrainians burned their villages and killed them.</span> <span id="s2133">And they needed us as allies.</span> <span id="s2134">So in our area, I know that there are stories that there were places where akar were killing Jews.</span> <span id="s2135">There were cases like this, not in our area.</span> <span id="s2136">In our area, we were allies.</span> <span id="s2137">One time I remember, there was a case where they were plotting to take our weapons away, and we discovered it, and -- so we had to show them whether.</span> <span id="s2138">We told them, if this is what you want, we are going to be on our own, and when the Ukrainians will invade your villages, you will be by yourself.</span> <span id="s2139">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s2140">Q: They backed down.</span></p> <p><span id="s2141">A: Right.</span> <span id="s2142">So what I’m saying to you -- you ask me about what did we do with the -- with the elderly.</span> <span id="s2143">We kept them not far from us, almost adjacent.</span></p> <p><span id="s2144">Q: In what -- I mean, in what way were you living?</span> <span id="s2145">In tents, just outside, blankets -- A: No, dug-ins.</span> <span id="s2146">Dug-ins, yeah, with --</span></p> <p><span id="s2147">Q: You would dig --</span></p> <p><span id="s2148">A: Dig -- dig --</span></p> <p><span id="s2149">Q: -- trenches?</span></p> <p><span id="s2150">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2151">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2152">A: Dig basements, and cover them with leaves, with branches -- Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2153">A: -- and soil on the top of it.</span> <span id="s2154">You know, it -- in the wintertime it was cold.</span> <span id="s2155">Sometimes, when it was relatively quiet, we used to go into a village, and camp in village.</span> <span id="s2156">But when we on -- when we were in the village, we did not allow the villagers to go in the direction of the city, because we were afraid that they will betray us, you know.</span> <span id="s2157">Another thing that we have played a role, which in my opinion was very, very important.</span> <span id="s2158">The Gestapo implemented an order that every peasant who will -- every -- every Pole, or Ukrainian who will deliver to them a Jew, will get a liter of vodka, or five kilograms of sugar.</span> <span id="s2159">And there were those that did it.</span> <span id="s2160">So one day we found out that an Ukrainian from a village, Potanachufka, delivered to the Gestapo a mother and a daughter, that’s a young girl eight years, or nine year old.</span> <span id="s2161">And of course the Gestapo took them and killed them.</span> <span id="s2162">So we went -- went in that night to the village, knocked at the door, took him out, slung him up on a tree in the front of his house, as a sign, this will be the reward for anybody who will turn Jews over to the Gestapo for a liter of vodka or five pounds of sugar.</span> <span id="s2163">That was the end of it, they didn’t do it any more.</span> <span id="s2164">It was a time where life -- life wasn’t worth much.</span> <span id="s2165">But, you know, what you have to do, you have to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s2166">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2167">A: When they started attacking Polish villages, we, with the Poles, started attacking Ukrainian villages.</span> <span id="s2168">You know, I told you about this guy that came to me when I was on the -- when I was on the steamroller, Moishe Lot?</span> <span id="s2169">He turned out to be one of the best sharpshooters that we had.</span> <span id="s2170">A young fella, you know, from a peasant family, small town -- very small town family, and one time we had an encounter with the Ukrainian nationalists, with the banderoftis.</span> <span id="s2171">And he crawled out to very, very front, and killed their machine gunnist, and brought back a machine gun.</span></p> <p><span id="s2172">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2173">A: Do you know what a machine gun meant to us?</span> <span id="s2174">It was a fantastic thing, you know?</span> <span id="s2175">So there were days -- days of good feelings, and there were days of sad feelings.</span> <span id="s2176">Me give you a -- another moment with -- has not to do with f -- with fights.</span> <span id="s2177">We came back from an engagement where we were fighting an Ukrainian group, I mean of -- all partisans.</span> <span id="s2178">And it was a b -- we lost a few guys.</span> <span id="s2179">And it was very, very tiresome, because we had to escape, we had to run, and we had to counterattack.</span> <span id="s2180">It -- it -- it was not one of the best days for us, it was one of the bad days for us.</span> <span id="s2181">And we came in, and one guy says, “Fellas, do you know what is tonight?</span> <span id="s2182">Tonight is Yom Kippur.”</span> <span id="s2183">We didn’t have prayer books, and we were not that terribly [indecipherable] but one guy who remembered the prayers, stood up, and started singing, you know, the Kol Nidre.</span> <span id="s2184">Jay -- Joan, I’ll never forget that.</span> <span id="s2185">I’ll never, never forget that.</span> <span id="s2186">It was so emotional, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2187">Q: For me, too, if you tell [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2188">Tell me a little bit about the command structure, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2189">A: The command structure, our -- first of all, I told you that we were fighting hand in hand with the -- with the akar -- with the armia kryova.</span> <span id="s2190">The commander of the -- all the forces was a -- a professor of the polytechnic [indecipherable] from Lvov.</span> <span id="s2191">And his pseunonym was Polcovnik Proch powder -- gun powder.</span> <span id="s2192">He was the main commander, and the rest was, you know, it shifted constantly.</span> <span id="s2193">You know, sometimes, it -- it -- Lot’s brother-in- law, Meisel, George Meisel was in charge of a group, sometimes I was in charge of a group, sometimes we joined together and we subjugated our command privileges.</span> <span id="s2194">We didn’t play army, I mean it -- it -- you know, it wasn’t the objective.</span> <span id="s2195">But it had to be organized, it -- and -- you know, when a guy went out with a -- with a group, either for food, or for weapons, or to attack somebody, or to burn down a village, you know, there had to be command.</span> <span id="s2196">There had to be command.</span> <span id="s2197">There was one guy among us, he was from -- from this area, and he was a true peasant.</span> <span id="s2198">He was fantastic.</span> <span id="s2199">We came back at night to the forest from an -- we called it aktia, from an action.</span> <span id="s2200">He took off his shoes, and walking with the bare feet, he felt his way to find the paths back to our woods, in the dark.</span> <span id="s2201">I -- I would say that a good many of us are alive today on account of him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2202">Q: So, are you saying that all of these different groups were in fact part of a larger -- A: Larger group.</span></p> <p><span id="s2203">Q: -- group.</span></p> <p><span id="s2204">A: Where Polcovnik Proch, Colonel Proch was in charge of.</span> <span id="s2205">Q: Was -- was the -- was the overall -- right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2206">A: He decided, you know, on major things, on going to, you know, burn down a village, or to go down a village and stand side by side with the Poles and fight.</span> <span id="s2207">There was one guy who was even a volksdeutsch, you know, and -- and in the village, he was considered a collaborator of the Germans.</span> <span id="s2208">And he was with us, and a good guy, and I don’t -- I don’t remember any more his name, believe it or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s2209">Q: So how would you get orders to do something?</span> <span id="s2210">Would there be a runner from whe -- wherever the command [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2211">A: An order was -- and order was given that we need 25 guys, or 15 guys, to go and do this and this and this.</span> <span id="s2212">First of all you took volunteers.</span> <span id="s2213">If you didn’t have enough volunteers, you appointed, you designated.</span> <span id="s2214">For instance, to go down and take care of this peasant who delivered the mother and the daughter to Gestapo, for this, only volunteers, and only -- there were too many volunteers for that, you know, so -- Q: So how was it chosen?</span></p> <p><span id="s2215">A: We decided that thi -- this one, this one, this one, this one goes.</span> <span id="s2216">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s2217">And you were part of that group?</span></p> <p><span id="s2218">A: Yes, yes, and I’m very proud of it.</span> <span id="s2219">Again, I feel very good about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2220">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2221">So, one could be a commander one day of a particular action.</span> <span id="s2222">It wasn’t as if you had a general that stayed as a [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2223">A: There -- there was no generals and colonels.</span> <span id="s2224">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2225">A: It -- it -- it was -- for instance, I mentioned to you George Meisel.</span> <span id="s2226">George Meisel was looked upon, you know, he was a brave -- he was a good shooter, and you know, he was looked upon as good material for leadership.</span> <span id="s2227">I often, you know, when I needed another team, I asked his team to join me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2228">Q: So wi -- did you actually have teams?</span> <span id="s2229">That thi -- A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2230">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2231">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2232">Q: That you stayed within -- sort of?</span> <span id="s2233">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2234">Q: So tell me something.</span> <span id="s2235">Arms were difficult to get, bullets, each one was very important -- A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2236">Q: How in heaven’s name did you get trained to do this?</span> <span id="s2237">You’ve never shot a gun before.</span></p> <p><span id="s2238">A: I can tell you that among us were kids, you know, that wer -- came out from Haider -- you know, from -- from -- young kids --</span></p> <p><span id="s2239">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2240">A: 17 - 18 - 19 years old.</span> <span id="s2241">They never in their life touched a weapon, leave alone used it, became the best sharpshooters, the most courageous guys to go into fire.</span> <span id="s2242">The most courageous.</span> <span id="s2243">And the courage was not only, you know, t-to go into a -- take care of a peasant.</span> <span id="s2244">We dealt with a well organized underground -- Ukrainian the banderoft is well- organized, well equipped, knowing the forest, knowing where to go, knowing the peasants clauses too, you know.</span> <span id="s2245">These were formidable opponents, and we fought with them.</span> <span id="s2246">We fought with them.</span> <span id="s2247">Now, as far as the Germans are concerned, when they -- when we came upon them, you know, we took care of, we took them on.</span> <span id="s2248">But only if they were in small groups.</span> <span id="s2249">The time when we really went after them is when the retreat started rapidly, when the Soviet army was already 50 - 100 miles away.</span></p> <p><span id="s2250">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2251">A: We used to be on both sides of the road, and if a small group came on, we took care of them.</span> <span id="s2252">The -- we got to a point where we forced them to put signs on the highways that no German is allowed to travel less than a foursome, and equipped with military --</span></p> <p><span id="s2253">Q: Because they knew what would happen?</span> <span id="s2254">A: -- with -- fully armed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2255">Q: So you still haven’t answered my question.</span> <span id="s2256">Were you -- was there training in shooting, or di -- wi -- simply you were given a gun, and you said --</span></p> <p><span id="s2257">A: No, when -- the first time you were given a gun you were taught what to do with it.</span> <span id="s2258">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2259">A: Then, if we had ample -- there were times when we had ample bullets, so we trained for sharpshooting.</span></p> <p><span id="s2260">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2261">A: We trained -- sharpshooting was very important with us.</span> <span id="s2262">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2263">A: Because we were not an army, you know.</span> <span id="s2264">It is a group of people -- do exactly, you know, and anybody that tells you that -- whether it was Bielski, or whether it was another, that they were an army, they were not an army.</span> <span id="s2265">They were partisan groups that we didn’t trust, higher up in -- in the -- in the forest of Belarusa.</span> <span id="s2266">There were many Russian partisans, well organized, who have gotten drops, military drops from Russia.</span> <span id="s2267">Some of them were good and took in Jewish partisans, some of them didn’t.</span> <span id="s2268">There was no unified form.</span></p> <p><span id="s2269">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2270">A: There was no unified order.</span> <span id="s2271">Every day was a day of it’s own.</span> <span id="s2272">Every day had it’s own dangers, every day had it’s own downers, and it’s own uppers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2273">Q: So there -- there couldn’t be an overall strategy.</span> <span id="s2274">A: Couldn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s2275">Q: Strategy was intermittent.</span> <span id="s2276">A: This --</span></p> <p><span id="s2277">Q: And you’re talking about sharpshooters because all you could do is take out one person or two people at a time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2278">A: Yeah, but it maked a big difference, because when they attacked them, and they saw that four or five are killed, they pulled back.</span></p> <p><span id="s2279">Q: Right, cause that’s a lot for them.</span> <span id="s2280">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2281">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2282">A: So it -- these were days, and tom -- in -- in my memory, these were my days of glory, because being -- you know, dismantling the -- the -- the cemetery of -- of Lvov was very depressing, very painful.</span> <span id="s2283">I mean, I felt that I am destroying a history of Lvov.</span> <span id="s2284">And there, you know, whether it was, you know, attacking, or defending, or getting even, it -- you lived by the power of your gun.</span> <span id="s2285">I didn’t intend to survive.</span> <span id="s2286">There was no one who hoped to survive.</span> <span id="s2287">The idea was to fight, and die on your feet, instead of living on your knees, so to say.</span></p> <p><span id="s2288">Q: So that was the real aim?</span> <span id="s2289">A: The aim, it was to get even.</span></p> <p><span id="s2290">Q: The purpose was to get even.</span></p> <p><span id="s2291">A: To get even, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s2292">Q: But when you had elderly, and children, the young women in some way could have defended themselves, but the young and the old could not have done it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2293">A: They couldn’t have.</span></p> <p><span id="s2294">Q: Does that mean that you had two purposes, in some -- A: Well, no, whatever our lot was, their lot was.</span></p> <p><span id="s2295">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2296">A: You know, our lot was their lot.</span> <span id="s2297">I mean, if we withdrew, they withdrew with us, you know.</span> <span id="s2298">Some of the elderly, you know, knew the peasants well.</span> <span id="s2299">They served a purpose.</span></p> <p><span id="s2300">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2301">A: They knew the peasants from before the war, they dealt with one another, although not always -- sometimes the peasants forgot all the [indecipherable] sometimes, in most cases.</span> <span id="s2302">You know, but in some cases, an elderly guy went down, and he came back with a piece of cheese, or with a piece of that pork belly, or th -- you know, and what have you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2303">Q: Did -- did you find s -- through -- it’s two years of being in this [indecipherable] over -- A: 23 months.</span></p> <p><span id="s2304">Q: 23 months, okay, almost two years.</span> <span id="s2305">Did people straggle in during this course of two years, or did you stay pretty much stable?</span></p> <p><span id="s2306">A: People straggled in -- no, people straggled in, but it was less and less as time went on, because more and more Jews were killed off, and the communities, the Jewish communities were wiped off.</span> <span id="s2307">The stragglers were basically people that were hidden by peasants, and for one reason or another, they have to leave the hiding place.</span></p> <p><span id="s2308">Q: And was -- as far as you remember, did it just happen that you became a f -- in a sense a family camp as well as an armed camp, or did you sit down, you guys, and you said, we can’t -- we have to take these people in, we can’t just say no to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2309">A: Look, they were family.</span></p> <p><span id="s2310">Q: But people did say no.</span> <span id="s2311">Other groups said no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2312">A: Yes, they w -- there were -- there were cases -- Q: So you had to make a decision.</span></p> <p><span id="s2313">A: There were cases where some groups said we will not -- we are hindered, you know, and we will not be able to function, having them with us.</span> <span id="s2314">Were we the noble people that saved them?</span> <span id="s2315">I don’t know what it is.</span> <span id="s2316">I don’t know how to describe it.</span> <span id="s2317">A good many were related, a good many were from the same village, from the same town, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2318">Although being from the same village and the same town doesn’t necessarily always make the difference between good and bad.</span> <span id="s2319">It just happened so.</span> <span id="s2320">It just happened so.</span></p> <p><span id="s2321">Q: Tell me, were any babies born?</span> <span id="s2322">Did women -- were women and men having --</span></p> <p><span id="s2323">A: You are touching -- you’re touching on a -- on a very sensitive thing.</span> <span id="s2324">Yes, babies were born, and they were done away with the minute they came out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2325">Q: They were.</span></p> <p><span id="s2326">A: I’m ashamed to tell you -- not ashamed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2327">Q: You couldn’t -- you couldn’t have survived with the babies.</span> <span id="s2328">And what happened when -- did the mother’s know this was going to happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s2329">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2330">Q: They did?</span></p> <p><span id="s2331">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2332">Q: And how did --</span></p> <p><span id="s2333">A: It was --</span></p> <p><span id="s2334">Q: Was it an --</span></p> <p><span id="s2335">A: It wasn’t talked about, it was a matter of delivering the baby, and making sure that the baby is not delivered alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s2336">Q: And who did that?</span> <span id="s2337">A: Women.</span></p> <p><span id="s2338">Q: Women did that to the babies?</span></p> <p><span id="s2339">A: Yes, women.</span> <span id="s2340">Sometimes a sister, sometimes a mother.</span> <span id="s2341">We didn’t have any 90 year old people with us when we [indecipherable] elderly, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2342">Q: Yes, yes, they were 50 -- A: They had functions.</span></p> <p><span id="s2343">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2344">A: This was one of the functions.</span> <span id="s2345">Q: That’s quite a function, isn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2346">A: Yes, it is.</span> <span id="s2347">Well, there weren’t any 10 - 12 babies a day, you know.</span> <span id="s2348">Q: No, no, no, no, I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s2349">A: But there were cases.</span></p> <p><span id="s2350">Q: So that also means that either peop -- women were coming in pregnant, or they were allied with --</span></p> <p><span id="s2351">A: No, they became around --</span></p> <p><span id="s2352">Q: They became pregnant in those circumstances.</span></p> <p><span id="s2353">A: Sure, sure, sure.</span> <span id="s2354">Look, we didn’t declare, you know, a standstill on sexual relations there.</span> <span id="s2355">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2356">A: We were young people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2357">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2358">And did some of the women get hysterical when this happened, when -- they couldn’t bear it?</span> <span id="s2359">Do you remember circumstances --</span></p> <p><span id="s2360">A: They usually were taken into the elderly camp, you know, when they were quite advanced, and didn’t come back until they came back, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s2361">Q: So you didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2362">A: Not that they were that far away from us, but you know, I didn’t know, perhaps maybe I didn’t want to know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2363">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2364">And of course there was no chance for abortion, there’s no -- there isn’t -- there’s nothing, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2365">A: As I told you, medical -- the -- we -- we happened to have -- in our group we happened to have a guy who was a half a dentist.</span> <span id="s2366">He was a --</span></p> <p><span id="s2367">Q: Half a dentist.</span></p> <p><span id="s2368">A: -- a -- a technologist.</span> <span id="s2369">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2370">A: He was a technologist.</span> <span id="s2371">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2372">A: He was the doctor, you know.</span> <span id="s2373">We di -- but when -- later, when we got stronger, when one of us got injured, we put him in a ve -- in a -- we had some peasant homes designated --</span></p> <p><span id="s2374">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2375">A: -- and we told them point blank, we are entrusting him with you, or her with you, and God help you if something happens to him.</span> <span id="s2376">True.</span> <span id="s2377">They were afraid of us.</span> <span id="s2378">They really thought that we are an organized, you know, 42nd battalion of the third army.</span></p> <p><span id="s2379">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2380">Sometimes that’s better than actually the real army.</span> <span id="s2381">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2382">Q: Tell me something about iodine, why was iodine so important?</span> <span id="s2383">A: A disinfectant.</span></p> <p><span id="s2384">Q: Mm.</span> <span id="s2385">And that was the best thing you could get your hands on?</span></p> <p><span id="s2386">A: What medicine did we need?</span> <span id="s2387">We needed, for instance, let’s say if you had stomach trouble, so there were elderly people that knew the jolad -- the -- the -- the different growths that grow in the woo -- in the forest, that takes care of it.</span> <span id="s2388">The injuries that we had was a bullet penetration.</span> <span id="s2389">You needed to prevent the infection, and iodine was the best thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2390">Q: Did this half doctor, half dentist ever operate?</span></p> <p><span id="s2391">A: Wa -- oh yes.</span> <span id="s2392">Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s2393">Operate.</span> <span id="s2394">Cut it a little bigger, and with a pair of pliers, which was boiled in hot water, pull it out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2395">Q: And were people given liquor, or did they --</span></p> <p><span id="s2396">A: Liquor, that was a different story, liquor, everybody was sick for liquor.</span> <span id="s2397">Q: They were?</span></p> <p><span id="s2398">A: Every -- sick for liquor, you know, everybody came declaring that they are sick -- Q: Oh, because wanted liquor --</span></p> <p><span id="s2399">A: -- because they could get the -- I’ll tell you a story with liquor.</span> <span id="s2400">We were told that about 30 miles away from our settlement where we were, that there is a home -- there’s a food depot of a -- of th-the German -- of the German army.</span> <span id="s2401">And it’s manneded by a few, like elderly Germans, you know?</span> <span id="s2402">So we went down there, and it was winter time, and went down with a sleigh, and with a horse, and we came in, and we loaded up.</span> <span id="s2403">We took some flour, we took some sugar, I remember.</span> <span id="s2404">And then, you know, we saw large kegs, we asked the guy, “What is this?”</span> <span id="s2405">He says, “Schnapps.”</span> <span id="s2406">So we took a keg, and we rolled it on the sleigh, and we brought it back to camp.</span> <span id="s2407">And the commander, Proch saw -- saw the -- the keg, he got ballistic.</span> <span id="s2408">So finally he asked -- he was terribly upset, you know, because it’s dangerous, you know, that it -- you getting drunk, you get loud.</span> <span id="s2409">So finally he ordered the keg to be half buried.</span> <span id="s2410">You know what I mean by half buried?</span></p> <p><span id="s2411">Q: Put it in the ground with half of the -- A: Half -- half the amount.</span></p> <p><span id="s2412">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2413">Oh, you mean -- you mean throw out half of it?</span> <span id="s2414">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2415">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2416">A: The keg half buried.</span> <span id="s2417">This is the keg, bury it that deep.</span> <span id="s2418">Q: Uh-huh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2419">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s2420">And it was for medicinal purposes, and for the purposes of rubbing yourself, because this was a good disinfectant.</span> <span id="s2421">So, all of a sudden, everybody claimed that he has lice, he has mites, he has this, he has that, and they need -- they need th -- some liquor.</span> <span id="s2422">So finally he got tired of it, and he br -- he m -- he broke a part of it, and spilled it in the ground.</span> <span id="s2423">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s2424">Q: Did you -- wou -- did you go after liquor, too?</span> <span id="s2425">A: Oh, hellow.</span></p> <p><span id="s2426">Q: And what --</span></p> <p><span id="s2427">A: This is where I learned to drink.</span></p> <p><span id="s2428">Q: Is it?</span> <span id="s2429">And how did it f -- how did it function, it dull -- it dulled you in some way?</span> <span id="s2430">Or it -- it’s made y --</span></p> <p><span id="s2431">A: First of all, it takes away fear from you, you know.</span> <span id="s2432">It kind of -- it’s a false courage, but it gives you a courage.</span> <span id="s2433">And you -- you ability of -- of making s -- quick, sane decisions decreases tremendously.</span> <span id="s2434">There -- there shouldn’t be any liquor on --</span></p> <p><span id="s2435">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2436">A: You know.</span> <span id="s2437">If I would have been Commander Proch, I would have, you know, destroyed the barrel completely, you know.</span> <span id="s2438">But on the other hand, if I would have been with Russian partisans, if -- if Commander Proch would have tried to break a barrel of liquor, they would have killed him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2439">Q: Let me ask you a question about relati -- the relations between men and women in the camp.</span> <span id="s2440">A -- in -- insofar as you could observe or experience, were women and men together because they cared about each other?</span> <span id="s2441">Were the women going to men because they thought they would be more protected?</span> <span id="s2442">How -- how --</span></p> <p><span id="s2443">A: Both.</span></p> <p><span id="s2444">Q: Both.</span></p> <p><span id="s2445">A: Both.</span> <span id="s2446">There were many, many cases where beautiful women from outstanding families, before the war wouldn’t have looked at -- at a given guy.</span> <span id="s2447">And she became his girlfriend, because she felt that he is protected, better protected.</span> <span id="s2448">Absolutely.</span> <span id="s2449">Absolutely.</span> <span id="s2450">And it -- I - - I’ll tell you one thing, it’s very difficult to be in judgment on these things.</span></p> <p><span id="s2451">Q: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s2452">A: You know, very difficult to be in judgment.</span> <span id="s2453">It was a matter of trying to survive, it was a matter of trying to take revenge, it was a matter of defending yourself, and defending those around you, or counting on this, that those around you will defend you.</span> <span id="s2454">You know, even on going out on ac -- on action, it always depended with whom you are going, and who is your back-up, because if you had good back-up, you had a better chance to come back home.</span></p> <p><span id="s2455">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s2456">No, and I’m not asking the question because I’m judging, it’s a matter of trying to figure out what the social relation -- how they -- how they really functioned.</span></p> <p><span id="s2457">A: Some of it was natural -- Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2458">A: -- that they, you know, either that, you know, were girl -- girlfriend and boyfriend from the small town where they were, or they got to know one another in -- in the forest.</span></p> <p><span id="s2459">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2460">Now, w-would it also be the case with some of the women, if they were the girlfriend of a particular person, would feel protected from the other men?</span> <span id="s2461">I mean, what -</span></p> <p><span id="s2462">-</span></p> <p><span id="s2463">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2464">Q: So that -- because men would n -- then not [indecipherable] A: No, she was just -- no, no, no.</span> <span id="s2465">Sh-She was his girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s2466">Q: So no one else would touch her.</span> <span id="s2467">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s2468">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2469">So a women who was not connected with somebody was vulnerable in some way?</span></p> <p><span id="s2470">A: L-Let me say this to you.</span> <span id="s2471">Yes, she was vulnerable, but the sexual promiscuity was quite - - quite there.</span> <span id="s2472">Th -- look, what else was there?</span> <span id="s2473">The life was threatened.</span> <span id="s2474">Sometimes you were hungry, sometimes you were cold.</span> <span id="s2475">When you felt the urge, man or woman, wha -- what is it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2476">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2477">I’m not -- n -- but I -- I’m wondering in some situations women feel a kind of vulnerability that they don’t want to --</span></p> <p><span id="s2478">A: It -- it was not an animalistic -- if you ask me whether it was an animalistic order, that, you know, a man went out and grabbed a girl, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2479">Q: Right, it was something else.</span></p> <p><span id="s2480">A: Either she was his girlfriend, or -- or neither one of them were attached, and you know, but if -- if a woman was the girlfriend -- I’m using, you know, that Moatcha Stralliska as an example.</span> <span id="s2481">He was a very common guy, he was a very crude guy.</span> <span id="s2482">He was a wonderful fella, you know, and as a companion in battle, you couldn’t have asked for a better one.</span> <span id="s2483">You couldn’t have asked for a better one.</span> <span id="s2484">So he wound up with a girl.</span> <span id="s2485">You know, as a matter of fact, they live together, you know, until today.</span></p> <p><span id="s2486">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2487">A: Before the war she would have never, never, never considered him as her mate.</span> <span id="s2488">And th- that -- you -- you have to bear in mind that it was a -- a life where every hour was danger, th -- I’ll say it to you, that the danger of dying wasn’t such a big deal, so -- so what is it?</span> <span id="s2489">Everybody dies around you.</span> <span id="s2490">The object is not to.</span> <span id="s2491">The object is to defend yourself.</span> <span id="s2492">The object is, you know, to demand a price for your -- for your being killed.</span> <span id="s2493">For instance, it was an accepted omen, an accepted formula that the last bullet is never used on the enemy.</span> <span id="s2494">The last bullet you always use -- was used on oneself.</span> <span id="s2495">This is not heroism.</span></p> <p><span id="s2496">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2497">A: This is instead of falling into the hands of the enemy and being tortured, and being, you know, that -- at -- abused, and -- and beaten, and -- an-and what have you, and then be killed?</span> <span id="s2498">So the last bullet, if the situation was such, if the -- often, you know, we went out, and if a guy got injured, and he couldn’t -- and we couldn’t get to him, so he stayed and waited on, you know, as close as the Germans or Ukrainians would come to him, and then he killed himself.</span> <span id="s2499">Let me lighten it for you, and tell you again a story that you will get a chuckle of.</span> <span id="s2500">We, as I told you before, were staying in the forest in dig -- in dug-outs, in -- in deep basements, you know, with a stove inside, it was warm.</span> <span id="s2501">You know, you could undress and sleep comfortably.</span> <span id="s2502">But as far as physical needs, to go to the toilet and what have you, you have to go outside.</span> <span id="s2503">So what we did is we took a plank of wood, and we tied it, or nailed it, you know, if we had nails, most cases we tied it between two trees, so a person can sit down, and, you know, do whatever he needs to, and come back.</span> <span id="s2504">It was very cold, and as a person moved his bowels, it froze.</span> <span id="s2505">And -- let me finish the story.</span> <span id="s2506">And so it kept on, you know, freezing, and normally when -- you know, when you move your bowels, and if you have a hard surface, it creates like an ice cream cone, a reversed ice cream cone.</span> <span id="s2507">So this kept growing, and growing, and growing until it reached the level of the plank.</span> <span id="s2508">And one of the guys got up at night, you know, no one wanted to go out at night, but when you couldn’t hold it any more, so -- and he ran out, and sat down on that plank, you know, to do -- to move his bowels.</span> <span id="s2509">But as he sat down, that frozen point of the accumulated bowel movement penetrated his buttock, and he was bleeding.</span> <span id="s2510">Until today, he is known as the partisan who was injured by a pile of shit.</span></p> <p><span id="s2511">Q: Oh my God.</span></p> <p><span id="s2512">A: Oh, did we have fun with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2513">Q: Oh my goodness.</span> <span id="s2514">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2515">A: So it wasn’t all -- it wasn’t all terrible.</span> <span id="s2516">It was -- it was pretty terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s2517">Q: It was really pretty terrible.</span> <span id="s2518">But tell me something, the people who didn’t have -- to go back to the more terrible again, you know, that’s quite a story.</span> <span id="s2519">The people who didn’t have guns -- the kids didn’t have guns, elderly, they didn’t have guns for everybody.</span> <span id="s2520">What was going to be their situation, if God forbid, you were surrounded, and you couldn’t get out?</span> <span id="s2521">Were you going to shoot people?</span></p> <p><span id="s2522">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2523">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2524">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2525">Q: You weren’t going to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2526">A: No, no, positively not, positively not.</span> <span id="s2527">I cannot tell you that every single person in our group had guns.</span> <span id="s2528">Sometimes guns were taken away from the rightful owner, if you send out a group for a serious mission.</span> <span id="s2529">But in most cases, you know, to take away a gun from a person who ha -- the gun was everything that one could dream of.</span> <span id="s2530">You couldn’t -- you didn’t dream of gold, you didn’t dream of diamonds, you -- you dreamt of getting a gun with bullets.</span> <span id="s2531">This was the only thing.</span> <span id="s2532">But I can tell you that after the 23 months, when the Russian army advanced, the [indecipherable] army advanced, and I remember that the first battalion who encountered us was an -- a battalion commanded by an Ukrainian major.</span> <span id="s2533">And he ordered that we surrender the weapons, we had to surrender the weapons.</span> <span id="s2534">This was an accepted -- and he said, “Who are you?”</span> <span id="s2535">And we told him we are partisans, and we are Jews.</span> <span id="s2536">So he says, “Jews?</span> <span id="s2537">Jews fight in Tushkient on the -- on the black market.”</span> <span id="s2538">This was the greeting, you know.</span> <span id="s2539">And this told me that I have nothing to look for in the Soviet Union, and I better go home.</span> <span id="s2540">And when I came home, I found an empty town, 11 people left alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s2541">Q: Of the whole town?</span></p> <p><span id="s2542">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2543">And told by some of my people that I knew from before the war, “Miles, you better get out of here, because if you won’t get out, they’ll finish you off.”</span> <span id="s2544">And I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s2545">Q: So, insofar as you know, how many of these 300 people of your group came out, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s2546">A: It wasn’t three, it was about 250 - 260.</span> <span id="s2547">I would say 150 for sure, if not more.</span> <span id="s2548">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2549">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2550">If not -- yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2551">Q: And did you simply disperse?</span></p> <p><span id="s2552">A: We -- when -- once the weapons were taken away from us, and once -- you know, we followed the army -- some immediately volunteered into the Soviet army.</span></p> <p><span id="s2553">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2554">A: Some of them, like I, wanted to go back to our hometown.</span> <span id="s2555">And some of them, it settled in -- in Lvov, or settled in -- in -- in Vlochov, or -- or what have you.</span> <span id="s2556">It was everybody for -- for his own, but let me say this to you.</span> <span id="s2557">I hope you will understand me right.</span> <span id="s2558">Most of the people that I am talking about were villagers, because the -- the -- the crème de la crème did not survive.</span> <span id="s2559">They did not survive not because they were crème de la crème, they were too soft.</span> <span id="s2560">They didn’t know how to -- you know, to resist, and -- and what have you.</span> <span id="s2561">So, when the war was over, everybody seeked his own level, his own intellectual level, his own level.</span> <span id="s2562">I must tell you that my sense for admiration and love, and you know, and camaraderie with these people, that whenever they have a simfeh, you know what that is, a -- a Bar Mitzvah, or a wedding, or a [indecipherable], or a funeral, of people that I was in the forest with, no matter how I busy -- I -- busy I am, it gets right out, and I’m there.</span> <span id="s2563">Special feeling.</span> <span id="s2564">There’s a spe -- there -- I have people in [indecipherable] you know, we are better than family.</span> <span id="s2565">Do I have a lot in common with them?</span> <span id="s2566">Frankly no.</span> <span id="s2567">You understand what I am saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s2568">Q: Yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2569">A: But, what difference does it make?</span></p> <p><span id="s2570">Q: But there’s something else.</span> <span id="s2571">There’s something else.</span> <span id="s2572">A: It’s much more -- it’s much important, much stronger.</span></p> <p><span id="s2573">Q: And how have you been able to be in touch with each other?</span> <span id="s2574">I mean, what was -- what enabled you all to find that you were in Vineland, or this one was --</span></p> <p><span id="s2575">A: Well, when --</span></p> <p><span id="s2576">Q: -- did you know each other’s last name, I mean, how di -- did you know each other --</span></p> <p><span id="s2577">A: In some cases yes, and in some cases, no.</span> <span id="s2578">In some cases yes, and some cases no.</span> <span id="s2579">I’ll tell you the truth, I meet sometimes some women in particular that were young girls, were children in camp, I don’t remember them.</span> <span id="s2580">They remember me, but I don’t remember them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2581">Q: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2582">A: You know, because I was always active, you know, I was always, you know, leaving, and you know, in one form or another.</span></p> <p><span id="s2583">Q: Did you have, in the camp, a sor -- a semblance of a little school for kids?</span> <span id="s2584">Did somebody teach --</span></p> <p><span id="s2585">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2586">Q: -- no</span></p> <p><span id="s2587">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2588">Q: So no one did that?</span> <span id="s2589">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2590">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2591">A: No.</span> <span id="s2592">In the ghettos, yes.</span> <span id="s2593">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2594">A: In -- in -- in the ghettos, even if it was illegal, there were secret schools.</span> <span id="s2595">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2596">A: But in the forest, no.</span> <span id="s2597">Songs.</span> <span id="s2598">Q: You did sing?</span></p> <p><span id="s2599">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s2600">Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2601">Q: And did -- was there some religious observance of holidays?</span> <span id="s2602">I ne -- know that you talked about Yom Kippur, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s2603">A: Only -- only high holidays.</span> <span id="s2604">Only important holidays.</span> <span id="s2605">You know, and frankly, you know, those were days when young people had very little feeling for religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s2606">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2607">A: If anything, it was anger and bitterness.</span></p> <p><span id="s2608">Q: So it got worse, it got [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2609">A: Anger and bitterness, simply wa -- if there is a God, why is he permitting it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2610">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2611">Now, some -- someplace you said that water was a more difficult problem of yours than food.</span></p> <p><span id="s2612">A: By all means.</span> <span id="s2613">By all means.</span> <span id="s2614">Food, first of all, you can go three, four days without food, and you will live.</span> <span id="s2615">You can’t go three, four days without water, and function.</span> <span id="s2616">You get crazy.</span> <span id="s2617">And when the Germans tried to encircle us, and bombard us, they kept pushing us, pushing us, and one time we were not aware of wh-where we are retreating, and we retreated on an elevation.</span> <span id="s2618">It was almost like a mountain.</span> <span id="s2619">This was not a mountainous area, but you know, at -- a high elevation.</span> <span id="s2620">And we were without water.</span> <span id="s2621">And we were without water for two and a half, three days.</span> <span id="s2622">And I can tell you I remember seeing people urinate and drink it.</span> <span id="s2623">And -- you know, and we were told not to do it, that this can create insanity, you know.</span> <span id="s2624">And finally we came to recognize that this is a very bad situation, that we will tr -- we will die, not being killed, but die.</span> <span id="s2625">And we broke through.</span> <span id="s2626">Meisel was at that time the commander, you know, when I -- and I joined up with his group, and we broke through, and we lost two people, and we got out of this area.</span> <span id="s2627">But water is a terrible -- och, thirst, I can’t begin to tell you how vicious it is.</span> <span id="s2628">You know, you -- your tongue gets parched.</span></p> <p><span id="s2629">Q: But you’re in situations where water is not free flowing, so how was it that you took care of water, even when you weren’t being [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2630">A: There were streams.</span> <span id="s2631">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2632">A: There were streams, and l-look, we were not that finicky, you know, that it must be boiled, and this and that.</span> <span id="s2633">There were streams, and if not, we used to go and bring water, and carry water, keep a -- keep a -- you know, a bucket, or a bowl, and you know, the -- the living conditions were very primitive, very primitive.</span> <span id="s2634">We washed ourselves, we [indecipherable] a lot, you know, whenever we came to water, you know, we used to shave our armpits, and our pubicle, you know, and make sure that -- we used to use kerosene for instance, you know, to prevent -- there is -- I don’t know how to call it in English, it’s a -- an insect that buries itself in the human skin.</span></p> <p><span id="s2635">Q: Lice, lice.</span></p> <p><span id="s2636">A: No, not lice.</span></p> <p><span id="s2637">Q: No, not lice.</span> <span id="s2638">Something else.</span> <span id="s2639">Ticks?</span></p> <p><span id="s2640">A: Mende.</span></p> <p><span id="s2641">Q: Mende?</span></p> <p><span id="s2642">A: Mende veshkey.</span></p> <p><span id="s2643">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s2644">So you would shave pubic -- women and men would do this in order to -- to be clean?</span></p> <p><span id="s2645">A: Right.</span> <span id="s2646">The pubicles, and the armpits.</span> <span id="s2647">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2648">A: And sometimes even the hair.</span> <span id="s2649">Hair not so much.</span> <span id="s2650">Q: So sometimes you would shave the head?</span></p> <p><span id="s2651">A: If it was badly infected, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2652">Q: And what was the effect?</span> <span id="s2653">This was itching, and [indecipherable] A: Drove you crazy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2654">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2655">A: Drove you crazy.</span> <span id="s2656">And the only way how to get it out is by squeezing one at a time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2657">Q: So did that mean other people would come to you and they would squeeze like -- like monkeys?</span></p> <p><span id="s2658">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s2659">These we -- Q: Do y -- go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s2660">A: These were pretty days, but they were not pretty days.</span></p> <p><span id="s2661">Q: No.</span> <span id="s2662">Do y -- you know, I don’t know that [indecipherable] that anybody can answer this question, but d-do you, when you look back on who you were before you escaped and became part of the resistance, and then who you are afterwards, do you s -- do you come back to sh -- Shmul?</span></p> <p><span id="s2663">A: To Shmoil?</span></p> <p><span id="s2664">Q: To Shmul, or is -- is -- is this person a very different person?</span></p> <p><span id="s2665">A: No, no, I -- you -- a person never becomes a totally different person.</span> <span id="s2666">A person broadens his horizons so becomes more tolerant or less tolerant.</span> <span id="s2667">Becomes nicer, or becomes uglier, but a person doesn’t change.</span> <span id="s2668">I believe that people are what they are, and they remain what they are.</span> <span id="s2669">Did I go into the underground knowing that I will survive for 23 months?</span> <span id="s2670">No, didn’t expect it.</span> <span id="s2671">But as I told you, I wanted to make sure that whoever wants my hat, will pay for it, and pay for it dearly.</span> <span id="s2672">Now, this sounds like bombastic talk, you know, and I don’t want to be bombastic with you.</span> <span id="s2673">The struggle for survival was purely natural, almost animalistic.</span> <span id="s2674">Almost animalistic.</span> <span id="s2675">Human nature is to survive.</span> <span id="s2676">Let a plane fly by and start dropping bombs, you know, you will be the first one to run, and I will be the first one to run.</span> <span id="s2677">This is human nature.</span> <span id="s2678">But to come back to the question that you are asking me, whether this changed me, oh yes, it made a tremendous impact on me.</span> <span id="s2679">I grew up in a home, in a gentle home, and a respectful home, and a -- a soft home.</span> <span id="s2680">You know what I mean by a soft home?</span> <span id="s2681">And the experiences, and they were experiences that were pretty ugly, pretty ugly.</span> <span id="s2682">All kinds of things.</span> <span id="s2683">And yet, there were moments of glory, and moments of feeling proud.</span> <span id="s2684">Now, I told you a minute ago that I don’t want to sound bombastic, and I am not a deeply religious man, but I truly believe that it was almost destiny, if there is such a thing, that put me in this path, and I am very, very grateful that I have the opportunity to do the work that I am doing, because it gives meaning, it gives purpose.</span> <span id="s2685">Do I go back to the days of Shmoil?</span> <span id="s2686">Very often.</span> <span id="s2687">And not necessarily in sadness, sometimes --</span></p> <p><span id="s2688">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2689">A: -- in glory, sometimes in happiness.</span> <span id="s2690">But I go back to the days of Shmoil.</span> <span id="s2691">I think of my mother very, very often.</span> <span id="s2692">Very often.</span></p> <p><span id="s2693">Q: And when you think of your mother, you see -- feel yourself as Shmul?</span></p> <p><span id="s2694">A: Yes, because it’s connected.</span> <span id="s2695">And of course, with mother I was in the difficult days also.</span> <span id="s2696">I am more -- father died a natural death, so whether he was young, or whether he was old, it’s immaterial, he died a natural death.</span> <span id="s2697">Nobody robbed him from us.</span> <span id="s2698">My mother, my sister was robbed from me.</span> <span id="s2699">That was taken by force.</span> <span id="s2700">My sister’s children, wonderful kids, wonderful kids, but so were others, you know.</span> <span id="s2701">I’m not an exception with that.</span> <span id="s2702">So there were days of feeling very depressed, and very down, and very almo -- n-no pity.</span> <span id="s2703">No pity on each other.</span> <span id="s2704">No pity on myself, but just days when it got to you.</span> <span id="s2705">And days when we came back from a mission and it was successful, days of glory.</span> <span id="s2706">When I came back from this village that night, I felt so good, I can’t begin to tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2707">Q: Did you sleep well that night?</span></p> <p><span id="s2708">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s2709">Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s2710">There are people that say, “How can you talk about it, when you took somebody else’s life?”</span> <span id="s2711">I say, “This is taking the life of a -- of a -- of a creature that had no right to be on this earth.”</span> <span id="s2712">Because if we wouldn’t have done what we had done, there would be other women and children.</span></p> <p><span id="s2713">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2714">Did you also have nightmares?</span> <span id="s2715">A: Still do.</span></p> <p><span id="s2716">Q: You still do?</span> <span id="s2717">And the content of those nightmares?</span> <span id="s2718">A: There -- they’re crazy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2719">Q: What, being chased, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s2720">A: Being chased, fighting, and you know, running and not making any distance, and you know, trying to load the -- the -- I had the Russian peppashah, with the round disk.</span></p> <p><span id="s2721">Q: What’s a peppashah?</span></p> <p><span id="s2722">A: It’s a hand gish -- a hand -- a -- Q: Oh, oh, oh, a handgun?</span> <span id="s2723">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2724">A: -- a automatic handgun that I -- that th -- the disk is full, and I can’t load it in, and all kinds of things.</span></p> <p><span id="s2725">Q: And are those the same kinds of dreams you had when you were in the forest?</span></p> <p><span id="s2726">A: Dreams are dreams, you don’t make an appointment to have a dream.</span> <span id="s2727">Dreams take you back 30 years, 40 years, two days, an hour ago, you know, and it gets all mixed up, you know.</span> <span id="s2728">But I am active at night, very active.</span> <span id="s2729">Ask Chris, she’ll tell you.</span> <span id="s2730">I talk, I talk Russian, I talk Polish, I --</span></p> <p><span id="s2731">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2732">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2733">I yell.</span></p> <p><span id="s2734">Q: Are you rested in the morning?</span> <span id="s2735">A: Sometimes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2736">Q: But sometimes it’s just exhausted you.</span> <span id="s2737">Tell me something Miles, or Shmoil, when you went back -- I now don’t know exactly what to call you, when -- when you went back to Tomashev, and you realized that your family is gone, and the town, essentially is a cemetery --</span></p> <p><span id="s2738">A: It was a very painful moment -- Q: Did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2739">A: -- very painful moment.</span> <span id="s2740">I -- believe it or not, but in the forest, I did not think about the fact that our people are being annihilated.</span> <span id="s2741">I thought about fighting, about surviving, about killing as much as I could, you know, to come out on the top of it.</span> <span id="s2742">When I came into Tomashev, and I saw the town, it was a cemetery.</span> <span id="s2743">I felt that I’m walking on tombstones.</span> <span id="s2744">I didn’t need that friend to tell me to leave because I am in danger, because you know, there were many, many people that came back, including Chris, you know, that came back, and you know, the extreme -- the extreme right wingers took care of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2745">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2746">A: I didn’t need it, I -- I couldn’t -- I couldn’t breathe the air there, I -- I choked.</span> <span id="s2747">You know, it was a beautiful community.</span> <span id="s2748">It was a community that offered everything that cultural life and a cultural society has to offer.</span> <span id="s2749">Everything, you know, in all these old-fashioned traditions.</span> <span id="s2750">When you -- at that time when I looked at them, they sounded silly, you know, to marry off a -- a -- a nitwit, you know, with another nitwit, they -- you know, it was silly.</span> <span id="s2751">Today when I think about it, I look how beautiful it was.</span> <span id="s2752">How beautiful, how generous it was.</span> <span id="s2753">How humane it was, you know.</span> <span id="s2754">In a community where, you know, traditions prevailed, and even the transition from, you know, Orthodoxy, and from piety, into modern -- into modern life, it was not a transition from piety and from scholarship to become heedens, you know, it is embracing a broader culture.</span> <span id="s2755">Embracing, you know, a -- a greater set of values, although the set of values, I have never taken for granted, and I never give them up.</span> <span id="s2756">The values that come with the life that was, are so exceptional, and so dear, and so extra special.</span> <span id="s2757">You understand that it -- you -- sometimes I feel that I -- I shouldn’t be talking, I should soak this up and swallow it.</span> <span id="s2758">Because this is my -- this is my inner Shmoil.</span> <span id="s2759">Just swallow it, because not everything you can put on the table.</span></p> <p><span id="s2760">Q: What does that mean for you to say swallow it?</span> <span id="s2761">So that it becomes -- A: Internalize it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2762">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s2763">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s2764">A: Internalize it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2765">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2766">A: Because either it sounds that you are, you know, bathing and -- and -- and -- and you’re wallowing in the ho-horribleness, or bathing in false worry, and neither is the case.</span></p> <p><span id="s2767">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2768">Let’s stop the tape now, please.</span> <span id="s2769">End of Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s2770">Tape #5</span></p> <p><span id="s2771">Q: Miles, when you decided to leave Tomashev, which was wi -- did you stay just a few days?</span></p> <p><span id="s2772">A: Few days.</span></p> <p><span id="s2773">Q: Mm.</span> <span id="s2774">How did -- how did you decide the next step?</span> <span id="s2775">Where w -- where were you going to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s2776">A: These were times when you didn’t plan ahead, you play -- you planned for the day, you know.</span> <span id="s2777">All I knew is that I cannot remain in Tomashev, that you know, th -- I -- I will have nightmares, and then in particular since I was warned to leave, so I felt I had to leave.</span> <span id="s2778">So I went into Lublin.</span> <span id="s2779">And in Lublin, this was the time where the first Polish government was forming.</span> <span id="s2780">You know, if you -- you ro -- you remember, the Poles divided up in Russia into two, it was an [indecipherable] army that went through Teheran, Israel, you know, and they stayed and fought on the side of the allies, and there was the -- the -- I have a -- a blank mind on the name of ma -- th -- the women.</span> <span id="s2781">There was a Polish unit, a Polish army that fought -- decided to come into Poland, to liberate Poland with the Soviet army, and help establish a -- Vonda Rosherefska, it was her name -- and to help establish a new Polish regime, a Socialist regime, so to say.</span> <span id="s2782">So Lublin became a very viable place, and -- and since in particular this was a time when people came back from every camp, from every corner, you know, and they were looking to find out whether someone is alive or not.</span> <span id="s2783">So it became a very viable Jewish center.</span> <span id="s2784">And I wanted to be there, hoping that maybe I’ll find something out about my sister, about her children.</span> <span id="s2785">About Mother I didn’t have much hope, because I -- you know, I didn’t think even if she wouldn’t been killed, that she would have survived these horrors.</span> <span id="s2786">And I settled myself in, I got an apartment, and -- and I needed to make a living, so I got into partnership with Leon Fellheldner.</span></p> <p><span id="s2787">Feldhandler is the -- one of the two commanders of the death camp of Sobibor, that have broken out.</span> <span id="s2788">It was Sasha Alexander Petroski --</span></p> <p><span id="s2789">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2790">A: -- and Leon Feldhandler.</span> <span id="s2791">Leon Feldhandler was a son of a rabbi of a small town called Ishbitza, not far from Tomashev.</span> <span id="s2792">And we became partners in -- in selling soft leather, because this -- his area was an area where they -- where they were producing, you know, they were treating hides, and converting it to leather.</span> <span id="s2793">And one night -- he was not active in any politics or anything, one night Polish extremists entered the house where he was, and killed him.</span> <span id="s2794">Now, there were many killings after the war, you know that.</span> <span id="s2795">But this killing was so painful in particular for the role that he has played.</span> <span id="s2796">Here is a man, the son of a rabbi, who was able to enter a role of leadership in uprising, in rebellion, and revenge in a death camp.</span> <span id="s2797">And to come out of it, and then be killed when he was hoping to start building his own life, a new life, very painful, very bitter.</span> <span id="s2798">So we stayed in po -- in Lodz -- in Lublin for -- oh, I would say, three, four months.</span></p> <p><span id="s2799">Q: After his -- he was killed?</span> <span id="s2800">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2801">Q: You weren’t afraid for yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s2802">A: Where -- where was I to go?</span> <span id="s2803">Where was I to go?</span> <span id="s2804">You lived under -- you -- you lived, you know, with circumstances.</span> <span id="s2805">You --</span></p> <p><span id="s2806">Q: Tell me something, did you two talk about each of your experiences?</span> <span id="s2807">Did he talk about Sobibor?</span></p> <p><span id="s2808">A: Oh yes, oh yes.</span> <span id="s2809">Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s2810">A lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s2811">Q: And did he -- he describe the -- the -- the -- the uprising, did he describe what was going on in Sobibor to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2812">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s2813">Q: What kind of a guy was he?</span></p> <p><span id="s2814">A: He was a marvelous man.</span> <span id="s2815">He was a marvelous man.</span> <span id="s2816">He was a learned man.</span> <span id="s2817">He -- he -- there -- he wasn’t religious any more.</span> <span id="s2818">This war, this experience turned him off, but a scholarly type of a guy, but not a scholar.</span> <span id="s2819">He was a -- an every day guy, and a good guy, a good looking man.</span> <span id="s2820">And he started dating a girl, she was a beautiful, beautiful girl, and when he was assassinated, she had a nervous breakdown.</span> <span id="s2821">She wound up in an institution.</span> <span id="s2822">What happened to her later, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2823">But I left Lublin, and went to Warsaw, but in Warsaw you couldn’t stay anywhere, because all of Warsaw was destroyed.</span> <span id="s2824">So, it -- it was a rebel -- a rubble.</span> <span id="s2825">So we went to Lodz.</span> <span id="s2826">Lodz was not destroyed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2827">Q: And who’s we?</span></p> <p><span id="s2828">A: That’s a good question.</span> <span id="s2829">No, it was I, for the time being.</span> <span id="s2830">It is in Lodz where I met Chris.</span> <span id="s2831">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2832">A: No.</span> <span id="s2833">You see, because I am thinking of Lodz, I am beginning to think in terms of we.</span> <span id="s2834">No, to Lodz I came by myself.</span> <span id="s2835">I mean, I had friends, I had people that I dealt with.</span> <span id="s2836">You know, there was Reuben Russet who was in -- in Brazil, you know, that we tried to get out of, you know, and tried to regroup, and reconstitute, and -- and do something with our lifes.</span> <span id="s2837">And I met Chris --</span></p> <p><span id="s2838">Q: How did you meet?</span></p> <p><span id="s2839">A: I owned a restaurant.</span></p> <p><span id="s2840">Q: A restaurant?</span> <span id="s2841">You got to Lodz and you opened a restaurant?</span> <span id="s2842">A: A nightclub.</span></p> <p><span id="s2843">Q: A nightclub, really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2844">A: With dances, and with music, and with food.</span></p> <p><span id="s2845">Q: Well, before you meet Chris, tell me how this happened.</span> <span id="s2846">A: I had to do something.</span></p> <p><span id="s2847">Q: Well, I know, but this is a -- this is really very different from anything you’ve done before.</span></p> <p><span id="s2848">A: It started off that, you know, there was a need for places to eat, because no one had households, everybody came in, you know.</span> <span id="s2849">So Reuben Russet, my friend, said, “Let’s open a restaurant.”</span> <span id="s2850">I said, “Let’s open a restaurant.”</span> <span id="s2851">So we opened a restaurant.</span></p> <p><span id="s2852">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2853">A: And it went off very well, you know, it -- you know, it was good, you know.</span> <span id="s2854">Q: Who was cooking?</span></p> <p><span id="s2855">A: We hired people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2856">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2857">A: I didn’t cook.</span> <span id="s2858">He -- he shopped.</span> <span id="s2859">Q: He shopped?</span></p> <p><span id="s2860">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2861">Q: And you ran it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2862">A: I ran it, but then we discovered that in the back of the restaurant is a big hall that used to be something, I don’t know what.</span> <span id="s2863">So he turns to me, and he says, “This would be very good for a dance hall.”</span> <span id="s2864">So we combined it, and we called it Little Hell.</span></p> <p><span id="s2865">Q: Little Hell.</span></p> <p><span id="s2866">A: Pigelko.</span> <span id="s2867">And it was quite good.</span> <span id="s2868">So Chris, with her sisters, came back from -- you know, from being liberated and sent to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s2869">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2870">A: She came back and -- and, you know, she found her uncle -- Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2871">A: -- who was in Lublin.</span> <span id="s2872">Q: You mean Lodz?</span></p> <p><span id="s2873">A: In Lodz, excuse me.</span> <span id="s2874">And we -- and one night she came with a -- a friend of hers from before the war, that he took her out for -- th -- he wanted -- basically he wanted her to have dinner, and she didn’t want to eat, she was too proud to tell him that he -- that she is hungry.</span> <span id="s2875">So she said she ate before she came.</span></p> <p><span id="s2876">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2877">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2878">She was gorgeous.</span> <span id="s2879">She was gorgeous looking girl.</span> <span id="s2880">And I -- I was a good dancer, so I asked -- I asked her partner whether I can invite her to dance, and of course, he said yes.</span> <span id="s2881">And we danced a lot that night, and we got to know one another, and we kept on knowing one another for awhile.</span> <span id="s2882">And she brought me up once to a gathering of people that were in camp together -- you know, probably this story from her testimony, and I came up and some of her friends said to her, “Don’t marry him.</span> <span id="s2883">He -- he is not for you, he is too -- too smart, too -- too -- too -- too slick.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2884">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s2885">This I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2886">A: And -- however, I liked her a lot and she liked me, and her uncle liked me a lot.</span> <span id="s2887">Hanya was for me, Rainya was against me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2888">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2889">A: And we got married, and I’ll tell you something about getting married.</span> <span id="s2890">Ev -- everything has a story.</span></p> <p><span id="s2891">Q: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2892">A: We were in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s2893">We went in to see a couple of friends of hers with whom she was in camp together.</span> <span id="s2894">And walking the street I come across Rabbi Kahanna, who was the chief rabbi of the Polish army.</span> <span id="s2895">He was -- he had the rank of colonel, I think, at that time.</span> <span id="s2896">And he was in Lvov, the professor that taught me Hebrew literature.</span> <span id="s2897">And he was very happy that he saw me, and I was delighted to see him, because he came back from Russia with that -- the advance for the Polish army.</span> <span id="s2898">So I told him, I say, “Professor,” [indecipherable], I don’t know how to translate it, but Sir Professor, you know.</span> <span id="s2899">“Chris and I are getting married, and I would very much like you to give us,” -- you know, “to perform the ceremony.”</span> <span id="s2900">And he thought for a moment, and he said, “I’ll do it.”</span> <span id="s2901">Joan, this was the first marriage in Lodz performed by a high ranking officer of the Polish army, my professor, Ted [indecipherable], it was a modern -- it was not like the old rabbis, you know, [indecipherable] around three times, and you know.</span> <span id="s2902">It -- it had meaning, his sermon had meaning, you know.</span> <span id="s2903">He talked about what we have just gone through, and what we are facing, and you know, how the future needs to be looked.</span> <span id="s2904">It was a very meaningful -- very, very meaningful marriage ceremony.</span> <span id="s2905">Very meaningful.</span> <span id="s2906">And I managed -- I managed to establish myself, and with -- I dealt with all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s2907">Among the most important thing is I have established a contact with the Polish government where they were paying the raberats with [indecipherable] you know, before war prices, and for prices from before war, you couldn’t -- a cookie, you know, cost as much as a day’s work.</span> <span id="s2908">So I made a proposition to him, I say, “I will supply you food for the workers, on pre-war prices, because you must pay them in pre -- in -- but you don’t pay me in dollars, or in zloty, but you pay me in goods, in textile goods.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2909">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2910">A: So I got textile goods for pre-war prices, and I supplied him with pork belly, with -- with onions, with beans, with all kinds of stuff.</span> <span id="s2911">And all I needed is an official document from the Polish government, that I am buying that stuff for the use of the Polish government, because I bought this on the black market, I bought it on the prevailing prices of after the war.</span> <span id="s2912">So I bought it for -- for black market prices, sold it for har prices, and got in return, textile on har prices, that I could sell on the open market and not be afraid that it will be confiscated, be -- I -- I don’t think I -- I -- yo -- you are with me, I probably confused you by now.</span> <span id="s2913">But this is the way it -- I do wa --</span></p> <p><span id="s2914">Q: Well, you bought low, and -- and sold high, essentially.</span> <span id="s2915">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2916">Q: Right?</span> <span id="s2917">Sort of?</span></p> <p><span id="s2918">A: Well -- no, it’s bou-bought legal and sold legal -- Q: Bought and sold legal.</span></p> <p><span id="s2919">A: -- this is the important thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2920">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2921">A: This is the important thing.</span> <span id="s2922">And things were going very well, until some local guy I was ready to load up a -- a boxcar with pork belly, and attach it to a passenger train to take it into Lodz, and he stopped me, and I gave him the documents, and he said, “I need to check them out.”</span> <span id="s2923">He was a bureaucrat.</span> <span id="s2924">And in the meanwhile the pork belly was standing with 90 degrees outside, and maggots start crawling over it, and I needed to hire people, and pay them to bury it.</span> <span id="s2925">And also, the government was a little uncomfortable, and they started to distance themself from it.</span> <span id="s2926">To make the story short, I had to stop this.</span> <span id="s2927">This was a very, very profitable business, I started making money.</span> <span id="s2928">And again I was told, it’s time for you to move on.</span></p> <p><span id="s2929">Q: Let -- can I go back a little bit?</span> <span id="s2930">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2931">Q: Did you -- do you think you fell in love with Chris the first time you saw her?</span> <span id="s2932">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2933">Q: You did?</span></p> <p><span id="s2934">A: Oh yes, oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2935">Q: That one night, that first night was [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2936">A: Oh yes, without any question.</span> <span id="s2937">Without any question, it -- yeah.</span> <span id="s2938">Q: Did you end up convincing Rainya that this was an okay thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s2939">A: Finally she -- she became -- she became my best friend, because we raised Rainya, Rainya was our daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s2940">Q: I know.</span> <span id="s2941">I know, I want to ask you that question, cause I thought that was very interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s2942">Hanya has a fiancé, and she went to school, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2943">A: She went to school, Hanya -- Hanya was -- Hanya was a scholarly type of a person, and they needed intelligent young people in the party.</span></p> <p><span id="s2944">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2945">A: And the party send her, you know, for schooling.</span> <span id="s2946">And if she wouldn’t have left Poland, she would have remained in -- on a high level in the political hierarchy of Poland, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2947">Q: Right, right, this was the elder sister?</span> <span id="s2948">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2949">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2950">A: And Rainya, when we were ready to leave, we gave Rainya a choice, she can stay with Hanya, and Hanya will take care of you, or you come with us, and whatever we will do, we will do with that -- there’s no stabi -- stability with us, because we are on the go, and you know, we want to get into Berlin, because we want to leave from Berlin.</span> <span id="s2951">I wanted to go to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s2952">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2953">A: To Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s2954">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2955">A: You know.</span> <span id="s2956">So we gave her the choice, she can come with us, or stay with Hanya, and she decided that she didn’t care much for Hanya’s husband, and she, you know -- and she stayed with us, and we educated her, and we brou -- I -- I look upon her as a daughter today.</span> <span id="s2957">You know, she --</span></p> <p><span id="s2958">Q: It’s interesting, she tells the story a little bit differently.</span> <span id="s2959">A: I’m sure of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2960">Q: Well, it’s interesting because her version is that she thought she would be a fifth wheel once you got married, once you were together with Chris, and you said to her, “No, you’re not -- you’re not leaving us, you’ll stay with us, until you’re ready.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2961">A: True.</span></p> <p><span id="s2962">Q: So I think she felt that she had two parents in a way.</span> <span id="s2963">A: It’s true.</span> <span id="s2964">It’s true.</span></p> <p><span id="s2965">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2966">And you had no hesitation about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2967">A: Bear in mind, number one, she was Chris’s sister.</span> <span id="s2968">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2969">A: Number two, we came out, we all were orphans, we all lost everybody, we all were lonesome, we all were alone.</span> <span id="s2970">You ask me how come -- you asked me before, did I fall in love with Chris immediately.</span> <span id="s2971">Of course.</span> <span id="s2972">She was a beautiful girl, and when I started talking to her, I saw the roots, you know, that wa -- became very obvious, because the war was over, you know.</span> <span id="s2973">You were not looking for partisans.</span> <span id="s2974">You were looking for a life companion, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2975">Q: [indecipherable] yeah, it’s different.</span></p> <p><span id="s2976">A: Of course, the criteria was different, and she was the right person.</span> <span id="s2977">I regret deeply that I never met her mother, because she was a very, very unusual, very special human being.</span> <span id="s2978">Of the stories that I heard about her, you know, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s2979">Q: And you see it in the three daughters.</span> <span id="s2980">A: Sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s2981">Q: And you see it in the daughters.</span> <span id="s2982">A: Oh, absolutely --</span></p> <p><span id="s2983">Q: You s -- you see the result.</span> <span id="s2984">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s2985">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2986">A: And we -- we came to Berlin, we stayed in Frapensai, and we -- I wanted to go to Palestine, but you know, Cyprus came about at that time, and the pictures of seeing Jews behind barbed wire was just repulsive, and -- and Chris told me, I -- you know, she says, “I think I’m pregnant, and” -- which she wasn’t -- “and I am not going to go to wind up in Cyprus behind wi -- barbed wire, I had enough of barbed wire.”</span> <span id="s2987">So we went and we applied to the American embassy, and the guy who interviewed her, saw Chris’s number, and he was very moved, and very -- and he was a very nice person, and he expedited it, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2988">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2989">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2990">And we left in February of 1947, we left for America.</span> <span id="s2991">Q: And you came to Jersey?</span></p> <p><span id="s2992">A: No, we came to New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s2993">Q: No, it was New York, New York, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2994">A: We came to New York.</span> <span id="s2995">We lived in New York for about eight months, nine months.</span> <span id="s2996">I had a good job, too good, and one day I came home and I said to Chris, “I’m quitting.”</span> <span id="s2997">She says, “Why are you quitting?”</span> <span id="s2998">I said, “The job is too good.</span> <span id="s2999">I keep getting raises, and raises, you know I’ll wind up working for him.</span> <span id="s3000">I don’t want to work for anybody.</span> <span id="s3001">I want to be in business for myself.”</span> <span id="s3002">You know, so he was a very nice person, you know.</span> <span id="s3003">He was an importer of Italian olive oil, and provolones, and you know, a lot, shiploads, very large import, and I was in charge of his warehouse.</span> <span id="s3004">And I quit, and I was going to start looking what I’m going to do, and I visited a friend in Vineland, and it was springtime, and it was green, and it was beautiful, and serene, and I liked it.</span> <span id="s3005">And I said -- this was the time when Jewish Agricultural Society helped the survivors settle themselves in on -- on - - you know, on farms.</span> <span id="s3006">And I applied, and they approved it, and I bought a farm, and I farmed for about -- ’48 - ’49 -- about four years.</span> <span id="s3007">And -- but I realized that this is not for me, and you know, I’m not going to spend my life being a farmer, so I established myself in the fuel oil business, in the heating business, and from it I got into the gasoline business, and the gasoline business is where I really made my business career in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s3008">Q: So you go back to petrol, which is how you started in world -- A: You got it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3009">Q: [indecipherable] in 1939, right?</span> <span id="s3010">A: You got it, you got it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3011">Q: How interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s3012">A: And -- go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s3013">Q: No, I was -- there’s nothing more to say about that, I was going to -- you go where you’re going to go, and then I’ll come back.</span> <span id="s3014">Where were you going to go with that?</span> <span id="s3015">You enjoyed doing that?</span></p> <p><span id="s3016">A: I -- I enjoyed doing it because I was my own boss.</span> <span id="s3017">But I did recognize that, you know, farming is a lifestyle, it’s not -- it’s not our -- it’s not a vocation, it’s not a business, it’s a lifestyle.</span> <span id="s3018">It was not my lifestyle.</span> <span id="s3019">I, you know, lived in Vineland, and I organized the farmers.</span> <span id="s3020">I formed the Jewish Poultry Farmer’s Association.</span></p> <p><span id="s3021">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s3022">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s3023">And -- but I got out of it, and let me say this to you.</span> <span id="s3024">Ever since I came to the States, I always was active in something.</span> <span id="s3025">Even in Berlin yet, you know, I was active, you know, in organizing [indecipherable] and -- and acting in unison, making us, you know, a more decisive factor, and so on, and so on.</span> <span id="s3026">And I was very active in [indecipherable] you know, from day one, I was very active in our town, [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s3027">And Yets Greenberg was the first one in America who organized a -- a small group called the Hora, to remember.</span> <span id="s3028">And I became part of that, and when Carter asked [indecipherable] to organize, and -- organize a -- a group of people, and come back to him with a proposal as to what we are recommending as a means of remembrance of the Holocaust, I was invited to be on the advisory board, because it was too late already, to get into the original board.</span> <span id="s3029">But a few months later, when the cun -- the United States Holocaust Memorial Council was organized, I was appointed by Carter to the council.</span></p> <p><span id="s3030">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3031">A: And the rest is history.</span></p> <p><span id="s3032">Q: Is history.</span> <span id="s3033">Let -- let me -- and -- and for those people who don’t know, who are watching this tape, there is a very long interview with you about your work with the museum, so people wouldn’t be deprived of that.</span> <span id="s3034">But I -- I want to know when you first contacted Jonah, and when you found out about your sister, and your brother being alive.</span> <span id="s3035">At what point --</span></p> <p><span id="s3036">A: Good question.</span> <span id="s3037">Jonah I contacted immediately when I came to Lodz, because I learned -- I knew that he is alive because he was in Palestine, but I got his address.</span> <span id="s3038">And there were people that came back from Siberia, the resettlement was a prolonged process.</span></p> <p><span id="s3039">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3040">A: That told me that my brother is in the southern republics, in Toshkint, and my sister is in - - somewhere in Siberia, I don’t remember now the name.</span> <span id="s3041">But I got both addresses, and I wrote them letters to tell them that Mother is gone, and Esther is gone with her family, that I am the only one alive.</span> <span id="s3042">And my brother send me the address of -- Froma send me the address of Jonah.</span> <span id="s3043">This is how it worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s3044">Q: Uh-huh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s3045">A: And they came back here, and -- and unfortunately they came at a time when I was packing rather rapidly to get out of Poland.</span> <span id="s3046">So they followed to Germany, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s3047">Q: They did?</span></p> <p><span id="s3048">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3049">Q: And both Peshe and Shlomo came to the United States?</span> <span id="s3050">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3051">A: No, Peshe came to Israel.</span> <span id="s3052">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3053">A: And Shlomo remained in Germany because he had a son-in-law who developed a very, very serious case of Parkinson.</span> <span id="s3054">And L-dopa was very restricted in the United States, where in Germany, you know, they gave it out rather freely.</span> <span id="s3055">And so he was stuck in Germany.</span> <span id="s3056">And he died there.</span></p> <p><span id="s3057">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s3058">And was he in -- in West Germany?</span> <span id="s3059">A: West Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s3060">Q: He was in West Germany.</span> <span id="s3061">A: West Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s3062">Q: So when was the first time all of you met?</span> <span id="s3063">Did you meet as a group, did you just -- did you meet individually?</span></p> <p><span id="s3064">A: No, we -- it -- when I came to -- to Israel, we met together, and then Jonah came here, and Jonah has a son, you know, a polio child.</span></p> <p><span id="s3065">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3066">A: And he was hoping that they will be able to do something for him, but they didn’t.</span> <span id="s3067">It’s an unfortunate thing, this is --</span></p> <p><span id="s3068">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3069">A: So there were sad occasions, and there were happy occasions, you know.</span> <span id="s3070">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3071">A: And as I told you I -- I -- I kind of felt that I owe it to myself, and to those around me to be active, to do something, to -- t-to give back a little bit.</span> <span id="s3072">And I gave back a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s3073">Q: I think you gave back a lot.</span> <span id="s3074">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s3075">Q: Is there anything you’d like to say that we haven’t talked about?</span></p> <p><span id="s3076">A: No, I -- I -- I think that i-if anything, maybe what I would like to talk more about, and you were chastising me for stepping away from my personal story, I think that the world that was, is not sufficiently known in America.</span> <span id="s3077">And I think that we need to find ways and means of documenting it, of writing it down, of discussing it, and making it part of our heritage.</span> <span id="s3078">The world that was, I -- I’m talking about the pre-war Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s3079">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3080">A: Has so much richness, so much positiveness, so much creativity.</span> <span id="s3081">Again, let’s not get carried away with -- you know, with Don Quixote stories.</span> <span id="s3082">There was a lot of poverty, there was a lot of struggling, there was a lot of bitter life in the eastern European countries.</span> <span id="s3083">There were -- there was more poverty than richness.</span> <span id="s3084">But you take the traditions, you take even the -- the world that started crumbling, you know, the Hassidic world, the ultra Orthodox world.</span> <span id="s3085">A world, you know, that went back to the 19th century, to the 18th century.</span> <span id="s3086">Even as they were being diminished in their importance and size, they carried a crescendo, you know, of elevations, you know, that were fantastic, fantastic.</span></p> <p><span id="s3087">And they were -- they were not the leaders, but perhaps they were the inspirers of those that stepped in into new life, into modern life, and trying to become part of the civilized Europe, playing a very major role -- a very major role in civilizing Europe.</span> <span id="s3088">Jews have played so many important roles, and paid such a handsome rent, wherever they lived, that we cannot talk enough about it.</span> <span id="s3089">But I’m talking about a handsome rent, I am not talking about money.</span> <span id="s3090">I’m talking about contributions that are made in the field of science, in the field of arts, in the field of judicial -- judicial progress in organization.</span> <span id="s3091">You take the countries, you know, first of all, of course, the ones on the front [indecipherable] Kalitsia was ripe for it because they encouraged.</span> <span id="s3092">They were more liberal, and they were receptive to Jewish involvement.</span> <span id="s3093">But even the -- you know, in the Soviet Union?</span> <span id="s3094">You take the period when the Soviet Union came to be, and you go through the leaders, and you will see that the people that really, you know, introduced Communism to the world, with a dream that they are carrying a better tomorrow, were Jews.</span> <span id="s3095">You take Germany, the Weimar Republic, and study it, and who were they?</span> <span id="s3096">Jewish intellectuals.</span> <span id="s3097">You take the creation, the -- the -- the -- the writers, and -- and -- and poets, and philosophers of Hungary, of Czechoslovakia, you know, of -- of -- of Germany, and it moved to Poland, and it came from Poland -- you know, I mentioned to you Vilno before, Vilno was a center not only of modern Jewish literature, a very strong center.</span> <span id="s3098">Vilno was also a -- center not far from Vilno, the [indecipherable] the great [indecipherable] scholarship that have set levels for the Jewish people, of world -- world prominence.</span> <span id="s3099">World prominence.</span> <span id="s3100">We d -- we made a bad mistake in my opinion.</span> <span id="s3101">In building the museum, you know, we have done many wonderful things, but we made a bad mistake by not going down two stories deeper, and allowing space for telling the story of the world that was.</span> <span id="s3102">We must do that.</span> <span id="s3103">It’s -- it’s something that we missed.</span> <span id="s3104">You can’t understand the importance of today unless you are capable of evaluating and giving credit, and discredit, whatever comes, to the world that was.</span> <span id="s3105">It was a beautiful life, of Jews that struggled, didn’t have it easy, but in spite of this, you know, what they have done, what they have done for Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s3106">Q: Well, I want to thank you more than you know for today.</span> <span id="s3107">A: Don’t thank me.</span></p> <p><span id="s3108">Q: And I think that you -- maybe you don’t realize that what you just said really fits with the story that you told about your family, and your parents.</span> <span id="s3109">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3110">A: Well, if I have done that, then I am re -- very pleased.</span> <span id="s3111">Q: I think you have.</span> <span id="s3112">And thank you so much.</span></p> <p><span id="s3113">A: Thank you.</span> <span id="s3114">You said something about photograph?</span> <span id="s3115">Q: And who are these folks here?</span></p> <p><span id="s3116">A: This is a friend of mine on the left side, the blonde fella, his name is Hooberman, and we were members of a youth club, it was called shamare atsyere, and in this club, we also created a -- a chess team.</span> <span id="s3117">And here I am trying to be -- trying to beat him.</span> <span id="s3118">I wasn’t too much of a chess player, I wasn’t too good at it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3119">Q: And you’re on the left?</span></p> <p><span id="s3120">A: What happened to him, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s3121">I am on the left, and I probably am here 16 or 17 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s3122">Q: -- ’35, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s3123">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s3124">Q: Think so.</span> <span id="s3125">Yeah, so you’re 15.</span> <span id="s3126">Okay.</span> <span id="s3127">This is 1936. ’</span> <span id="s3128">35, right?</span> <span id="s3129">A: ’35.</span> <span id="s3130">February the 10th, 1935.</span></p> <p><span id="s3131">Q: And who is this handsome gentleman?</span></p> <p><span id="s3132">A: That handsome guy happens to be me, more or less in the same period.</span> <span id="s3133">Q: And you’re wearing a Jewish star on your --</span></p> <p><span id="s3134">A: It probably is an insignia, either from a sports club, or from the -- the shamare atsyere, either one.</span></p> <p><span id="s3135">Q: Now this is 1936, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s3136">A: I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s3137">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3138">A: 1936.</span></p> <p><span id="s3139">Q: Wh-What’s this group now?</span></p> <p><span id="s3140">A: This is the group that I was telling you, the shamare atsyere group, and I -- some people that are in this picture are no longer with us.</span> <span id="s3141">I am embarrassed to tell you that a good many of them I don’t remember the names any more.</span> <span id="s3142">But I remember each and every one of them, and I -- in my mind I remember stories of wh -- what -- what we did together, you know, or -- or certain segments, but if you ask me to identify the names one by one, I can’t do it.</span> <span id="s3143">You notice me, I am sitting on the first row on the left hand side, second from the left.</span></p> <p><span id="s3144">Q: And the picture on the left?</span></p> <p><span id="s3145">A: The picture on the left is my mother, and -- and we are walking in Lvov, on the main Ligiornof is the name of -- the main -- the main corso in -- in Lvov.</span> <span id="s3146">It’s -- it was a beautiful, beautiful city, and Mother came to visit me.</span> <span id="s3147">I was studying in Lvov in those days.</span> <span id="s3148">And I dressed up in my best, and took my mother out to -- you know, to visit places in -- in Lvov.</span> <span id="s3149">The picture on the right is my mother, I think it’s -- the picture is taken a little later than this one.</span> <span id="s3150">Probably ’39, maybe.</span> <span id="s3151">It looks to me like this was a picture taken for a passport, and we lodged it, I think so.</span> <span id="s3152">You notice that Mother is wearing a wig, Mother was a pious woman, very religious woman, but a fantastic, fantastic achiever.</span></p> <p><span id="s3153">Great lady.</span></p> <p><span id="s3154">Q: And this photo?</span></p> <p><span id="s3155">A: This photo is a photo of myself right after the war, when I came out from the underground, and I came to Lvov, and I took the first picture for a kankarta -- for -- for a passport.</span> <span id="s3156">And at that time I -- I weighed the least that I remember myself, 140 some pounds.</span></p> <p><span id="s3157">Q: And on the left?</span></p> <p><span id="s3158">A: On the left it’s me again, in Lodz, 1946, and next to me is my beloved, Chris, a beautiful, beautiful person, in and out.</span> <span id="s3159">Just as beautiful inside as outside.</span> <span id="s3160">And we have a lot in common, we had a lot in common in memories.</span> <span id="s3161">And she comes from a beautiful family and I regret very much that I didn’t have an opportunity to get to know her family, and I’m sure that if my mother would have known her, she would have loved her just as much.</span></p> <p><span id="s3162">Q: And the top picture?</span></p> <p><span id="s3163">A: The top picture is a picture of me on the marine perch, as we are entering the harbor in New York, after a crossing that lasted 16 days from ha -- Hamburg to New York.</span> <span id="s3164">If you look closer at the picture, you will see the Statue of Liberty is right smack over my head.</span> <span id="s3165">The bottom picture is Chris and I again on the same boat, on the marine perch, as we are standing and admiring the constant flow of cars on th -- the west side -- west side highway.</span></p> <p><span id="s3166">Q: The shot on top?</span></p> <p><span id="s3167">A: The picture on the top is I’m standing with Chris, and with my sister-in-law, Rainya, this is Chris’s younger sister.</span> <span id="s3168">And the picture on the bottom is in Vineland, where, when we came there, we bought a farm, and I raised poultry for about three to four years.</span> <span id="s3169">And you see the -- the
