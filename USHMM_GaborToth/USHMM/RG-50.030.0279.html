1993</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: Could you be so kind to tell us your name?</span> <span id="s12">A: My name is Max Schmidt.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: When and where you were born, please?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: In January '31, 1909 in Czernowitz.</span> <span id="s15">At that time, the Austrian-Hungarian Empire.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: Could you tell us a few words about the background of your family and about your childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: Well, my father was a house painter.</span> <span id="s18">My mother was a housewife.</span> <span id="s19">I had two more brothers, and our -- my has been somehow cultural because my father was very much interested that we should learn and read a lot of books.</span> <span id="s20">One of my brothers is a lawyer, my oldest brother was a -- my middle brother is a doctor.</span> <span id="s21">And I studied in engineer, so the cultural values of my family was very high.</span> <span id="s22">And he was only a house painter, he worked only during the summertime.</span> <span id="s23">Winter in Germany was very difficult, and as a painter he couldn't -- well, that is -- I didn't encounter anti-Semitism until I became a student at the university in Brest in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s24">There the German students were extremely anti- Semitic, and they had been carrying here a swastika, a small swastika in the lapel, but we did ignore them.</span> <span id="s25">The professor was also anti-Semitic, but if we responded, we made the exam.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">So they had to give us all the good grades.</span> <span id="s27">But, in general, we had difficulties over there as Jews.</span> <span id="s28">The great thing was it was in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s29">When I studied, the President of Czechoslovakia was Tom√°s Masaryk, and he was a great man.</span> <span id="s30">One employee in the directorate of the university told me expresses verbally, as long as there was a picture of Masaryk, as long as Masaryk lives, you and I, we can live, too.</span> <span id="s31">When he is gone we will have trouble.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: Interesting.</span> <span id="s33">When did you return to Czernowitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: I did return in '37, and I did have trouble finding a job.</span> <span id="s35">Although Czernowitz was in the majority Jews and as little industry as it was there, but we couldn't get a job.</span> <span id="s36">Very, very difficult, because there were many authorities, they make the difficulties.</span> <span id="s37">Then I went to Bucharest.</span> <span id="s38">In Bucharest I couldn't find a job.</span> <span id="s39">Whatever I did, I wrote every day, but Jews, no.</span> <span id="s40">As a Jew, no, I couldn't get a job.</span> <span id="s41">Finally, in my last year before the war, I did find a job with a Romanian/Italian company, which make artesian wells, you know.</span> <span id="s42">Budoi (ph) was his name, he was a nice fellow.</span> <span id="s43">And I worked with him and when Bucovina was occupied by the Russians, I had to leave and I went home.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: So when did you reach Czernowitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: I reached Czernowitz in '40.</span> <span id="s46">And from '40, I worked under the Russian regime in a factory.</span> <span id="s47">Q: Did you witness any deportations done by the Russians during 1940?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s49">Yes.</span> <span id="s50">Just right before the war or the outbreak of the war, the Russians deported a lot of Czernowitz people which had been before well-situated, good situated.</span> <span id="s51">Had companies or he was a lawyer, even a tailor.</span> <span id="s52">They took a tailor.</span> <span id="s53">There was one tailor, a Social Democrat, they took him.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: You are talking about Jewish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: Jewish people, yeah.</span> <span id="s56">And of Christian people, they took very, very, very little.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: Can you estimate how many people were deported from Czernowitz, a rough estimate?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: Well, at that time probably 5,000 and 7,000.</span> <span id="s59">They took from the province, also.</span> <span id="s60">And they made it, from the province, they made everything of Czernowitz, it's Czernowitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: But when you say 5 to 7,000, you are talking only about Czernowitz, or about the whole occupied . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: It's about the whole . . . Q: About the whole?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: . . . because that is only the people who were good situated, the Russians.</span> <span id="s64">They didn't touch other people.</span> <span id="s65">The Romanians touched everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: I understand.</span> <span id="s67">Can you tell us what happened to you, and to your family once the military operations started in June 1941, the military operation done by Romanians and Germans against Soviet Union?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s69">I was at that time -- my parents were dead.</span> <span id="s70">My brothers were in America.</span> <span id="s71">I was the only one in Czernowitz, and I was married.</span> <span id="s72">And when I -- when the deportations began, they deported me, my wife, my mother-in-law and two more sisters-in-law.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: I would like you to tell us a few words, in a few words what happened to you before the deportations.</span> <span id="s74">I mean, because Czernowitz was occupied by the Romanians sometime in June, and you were deported sometime in October, if I'm correct.</span> <span id="s75">So I would like to know what was the life at the beginnings of the ghetto in Czernowitz, your life . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: Life was very bad.</span> <span id="s77">Life was very bad.</span> <span id="s78">We couldn't get -- we didn't have any work to do.</span> <span id="s79">We couldn't do, but we were taken out for forced labor.</span> <span id="s80">I was taken out by my hair, and to clean the street.</span> <span id="s81">There was a big park in Czernowitz, Folksgarden (ph).</span> <span id="s82">What we had to do is clean the park.</span> <span id="s83">We did all kinds of forced work, forced labor, but we didn't get paid.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: Do you remember when was the Yellow Star introduced in Czernowitz, if it was any?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: The Yellow Star, yeah, the Yellow Star was.</span> <span id="s86">But it came about two months or three months before the deportation.</span> <span id="s87">In fact, I was in an office when they told me to come, but I didn't have the Yellow Star.</span> <span id="s88">He told me "Where is your Hakenkreuz?"</span> <span id="s89">I said, "I have no Hakenkreuz."</span> <span id="s90">He said, "You need a Hakenkreuz."</span> <span id="s91">A Yellow Star.</span> <span id="s92">And by -- he didn't punish me, but it was some, I would say, a rarity.</span> <span id="s93">Because other people have been very much punished when they didn't carry a Yellow Star.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: Could you tell us what happened to you and your family when the ghetto was sealed and when the deportations started in Czernowitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s96">Well, we -- when they started, every day they eliminated one or two streets where we have been before.</span> <span id="s97">And they pushed us more and more to another part of the city, which was in old time inhabited by a lot of Jews.</span> <span id="s98">This is not .</span> <span id="s99">And they pushed us every day, they closed the street.</span> <span id="s100">I lived, for example, close to the National Theater.</span> <span id="s101">One day they came in and said, " .</span> <span id="s102">You cannot live anymore here."</span> <span id="s103">And we had to take whatever we could take by hand and leave.</span> <span id="s104">So that was two or three days, and then they sealed the ghetto.</span> <span id="s105">And we were in a very small place, and about a day later started evacuation.</span> <span id="s106">They drove us to the railroad and we had -- and the wagon without anything.</span> <span id="s107">And we couldn't take anything, only what we can carry.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: So you were deported with your wife, and who else?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: My wife, my mother-in-law and two more sisters-in-law of mine.</span> <span id="s110">And then we went to Mogilev, we came to Akaki.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: This was a crossing point?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s113">Akaki (ph) was the first before.</span> <span id="s114">Akaki was still Romanian, and then came the Dnestr and then Mogilev and we were in the Ukraine.</span> <span id="s115">And that was a very bad view that we have seen from Akaki, because before us there are other people already.</span> <span id="s116">The Yelets (ph) from four parts in Bessarabia, in Bucovina.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: And did you meet these people from Yelets?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: No, I didn't meet because when we came, they were driven further.</span> <span id="s119">They were driven further, and we were only about a day and a night.</span> <span id="s120">And then the next day they started to drive us.</span> <span id="s121">It was raining all night, it was a very cold, and you couldn't walk because it was a morass.</span> <span id="s122">And they drove us, we got hit -- I got hit by a Romanian soldier here and there and to let go my package.</span> <span id="s123">And I let go, but my wife asked him "Look, I want to have this one.</span> <span id="s124">Give it to me."</span> <span id="s125">So somehow he gave it to her.</span> <span id="s126">And that package was my documents, my certificates from the university from my diplomas in engineer.</span> <span id="s127">And then we were walking, walking; suddenly, I fell because I slipped and fell into -- it was hole.</span> <span id="s128">But I got up to here, and I knew I couldn't get out.</span> <span id="s129">My wife wanted to reach out for me, but she couldn't, she was pushed further from me.</span> <span id="s130">Because she couldn't stop, she was walking.</span> <span id="s131">Somebody, probably a man, gave me his hand and pulled me out, so I came -- I was saved.</span> <span id="s132">I couldn't even thank him, I didn't know who it was because he was pushed, you know.</span> <span id="s133">We were so driven and hit by the soldiers that we couldn't even breathe.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: This was where?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: In Akaki.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: In Akaki.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: They pushed us towards the Dnestr.</span> <span id="s138">My wife already knew that I'm dead.</span> <span id="s139">But then later I did find her on the shore of Akaki, and we went over at night and in a barge.</span> <span id="s140">Some people before us and after us were in the barge.</span> <span id="s141">They turned the barge, and fell in the cold water and they drowned.</span> <span id="s142">We somehow survived.</span> <span id="s143">Later on I did find my mother-in-law and my two sisters also.</span> <span id="s144">They survived and were already in Mogilev in a shack, in an old house.</span> <span id="s145">It was -- the house was uninhabitable, but it was there, so we started -- we had been united.</span> <span id="s146">The next day I heard that there was somebody who would make work for -- working for the government.</span> <span id="s147">Looking for workers.</span> <span id="s148">Workers who know their , so I went to see this man.</span> <span id="s149">When I -- in order to come there, I had to go to a places, to streets I didn't know.</span> <span id="s150">But I saw that the Romanian soldiers and Ukrainians were banded together and robbing the people they met in the street.</span> <span id="s151">And I went and zigzagged not to meet the people, and I came to the Dnestr.</span> <span id="s152">But there was a big house, and they told me this is the house of the rabbi (ph), and there is Yegendorf (ph).</span> <span id="s153">I entered this building and I asked a woman, "I want to speak to Yegendorf."</span> <span id="s154">She told me "Yegendorf is not here, he will come and then you can talk to him."</span> <span id="s155">And I didn't know him.</span> <span id="s156">I said, "How should I recognize Yegendorf?"</span> <span id="s157">She told me, "He has a white collar, he is always white collar.</span> <span id="s158">It's nice."</span> <span id="s159">And so I recognized him.</span> <span id="s160">When he came from the Prefect, he told me then he came the Prefect.</span> <span id="s161">And I told him who I am, what I do and I would like to do.</span> <span id="s162">He said to me, "All right.</span> <span id="s163">Come tomorrow 7 o'clock in the morning."</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: You were an engineer, correct?</span> <span id="s165">A: Yes, I was an engineer.</span> <span id="s166">I still am.</span> <span id="s167">Q: I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s168">In what?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: Mechanical engineer.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: Mechanical engineer, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: And so next day, I came and we all went to see this Timisoara (ph).</span> <span id="s172">And he went along at my side, and he asked me, "What can we do here?</span> <span id="s173">What can we do here and here?"</span> <span id="s174">And I said, "It's very difficult, but we have to do whatever we can, and we will do."</span> <span id="s175">He said, "All right."</span> <span id="s176">So that was the beginning of my relationship with Yegendorf.</span> <span id="s177">He made me -- I have this document as a , the chief engineer.</span> <span id="s178">Chief engineer was a Mr. Bingerstratts (ph).</span> <span id="s179">He was the, how shall I say, the son-in-law of a very rich man from Radom, who was on the .</span> <span id="s180">Yegendorf was also on the .</span> <span id="s181">So this Bingerstratts was made chief engineer; I was his deputy.</span> <span id="s182">So we started little by little, we started to build up this Timisoara.</span> <span id="s183">Yegendorf was in the beginning a nice fellow, but the more power he got the more he became brutal.</span> <span id="s184">And he was intellectually a lightweight, but there were people around us, which certainly you know, there was a Dr. Kessler (ph), a lawyer, from Donetsk (ph).</span> <span id="s185">He was a very, very clever man and a highly intelligent man.</span> <span id="s186">Kessler was his alter-ego for Yegendorf.</span> <span id="s187">If Kessler proposed what to do, Yegendorf signed and said, "I did it."</span> <span id="s188">And so it went with a lot of penchants in the Timisoara.</span> <span id="s189">People did a lot of things to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: Can you explain how come this Timisoara (ph), this foundry, was created?</span> <span id="s191">What was the interest of the Romanian authorities to create the foundry and why they wanted -- why they went ahead with this idea?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: Well, so far as I know, there was a lot of people, the prefect of Mogilev had some people around himself that were Jews.</span> <span id="s193">Yegendorf had some people around him that were also Jews.</span> <span id="s194">And they made business, one group with the other.</span> <span id="s195">In order to make business and that it should be something we make work for the benefit of the country, so it was war.</span> <span id="s196">The Timisoara (ph), which could repair cars, tractors, and do other things, was very important for the Germans and for the Romanians.</span> <span id="s197">And besides, the great motive of this, I believe, was people -- the Romanians, the Prefect, the Major of the gendarmerie, who was -- they wanted to make business; they wanted to get rich.</span> <span id="s198">And my personal opinion is that this is our luck, because we could corrupt them with money and we could stay there.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: So if I understand when Mogilev was practically a huge ghetto, which had this foundry, this Timisoara (ph), as the main industrial unit?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s201">The Timisoara (ph) was there when the Russians had -- after they were done.</span> <span id="s202">When they left they destroyed a lot of this.</span> <span id="s203">Now, Yegendorf and Prefect Bayona (ph), who was, by the way, an Austrian-Romanian, he was serving in the Austrian Army during the First World War.</span> <span id="s204">Yegendorf was a lieutenant of the First -- in the Austrian Army of the First World War.</span> <span id="s205">So they had a common language.</span> <span id="s206">They both spoke German, and they both understood each other.</span> <span id="s207">They made it in order to have a hinterland.</span> <span id="s208">To provide for the army, for the force or whoever.</span> <span id="s209">And we did a lot of things for the army, for the Romanian Army and for the German Army.</span> <span id="s210">The Germans came in and gave the order and we did it.</span> <span id="s211">In the beginning we had our difficulties because we -- there was not instruments.</span> <span id="s212">We had to begin from zero.</span> <span id="s213">The first hammer we made, I remember there was an old man by the name of Bloan (ph) Schmitt.</span> <span id="s214">And he took a piece of iron and two bricks and put a fire in the two big bricks, and put the iron in the fire.</span> <span id="s215">Then with another brick, he hammered this out and we had the first hammer.</span> <span id="s216">So we made instruments and we made instruments for our lathe machine, for our planning machine, for our blazer, the Timisoara (ph) infected was a -- have a molten, the iron started to work and we did a lot of things over for the government, for the Romanians.</span> <span id="s217">And, by the way, some people made money, the big ones of the Romanians.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: If my understanding is correct, some of the Jews from Mogilev were deported later from Mogilev to Szydlowiec, am I correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: Can you elaborate on this?</span> <span id="s221">Can you describe to us what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: I can only tell you that one day we had a lot of some -- in my department there was about five Mogilev Jews, workers, real good workers.</span> <span id="s223">And in order not to be deported, they had to be working in the Timisoara (ph).</span> <span id="s224">And so we had a lot in other departments, some Russian Jews.</span> <span id="s225">But the majority was deported to Szydlowiec or other places.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: Did you witness those deportations?</span> <span id="s227">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: Can you tell us a little bit more about the life in the ghetto, day-to-day life about how was the ghetto business conducted by Yegendorf and so on?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: It's difficult because I didn't -- I haven't been in the city, in Mogilev.</span> <span id="s230">My work was always with Timisoara (ph), but I heard Yegendorf was -- they had formed committees.</span> <span id="s231">And Yegendorf was the President of the committee.</span> <span id="s232">And the committee had some people from other localities, sometimes from , from Soroki, Domnitsa.</span> <span id="s233">In the beginning was Domnitsa and Mogilev, but then he went to Szydlowiec with his people.</span> <span id="s234">There was another Mr. Cotts (ph), an engineer from Soroki, and he became a member of the committee.</span> <span id="s235">And that was one man who was against Yegendorf.</span> <span id="s236">Yegendorf and Cotts were two .</span> <span id="s237">Yegendorf, when he didn't like something or somebody, he just resigned.</span> <span id="s238">And the committee was dissolved and then the Prefect gave him another shot, make another committee.</span> <span id="s239">And he did another committee with other people.</span> <span id="s240">Yegendorf was a manipulator.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: Manipulator.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: Manipulator.</span> <span id="s243">And Cotts was a strong personality and didn't accept everything with Yegendorf.</span> <span id="s244">Yegendorf also wrote -- he resigned from a committee and wrote to the Prefect that the next committee the Prefect has nominated is not doing the job.</span> <span id="s245">They are doing just -- they are caring only for themselves.</span> <span id="s246">They make business from the committee, and neglect the benefits of the other people.</span> <span id="s247">It was a lot of accusations, a letter is there.</span> <span id="s248">In the book from Yegendorf he is mentioning this letter, that Yegendorf denounced a committee and wanted to have the committee annulled and given to him again.</span> <span id="s249">So that was the policies in Mogilev.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">They made outside of city, they made somehow as -- a collective workers who could work like all kinds of, how shall I say, shoemakers.</span> <span id="s251">Carpenters.</span> <span id="s252">And they started to work, and Cotts was informed, was the President of these ateliers.</span> <span id="s253">And Yegendorf and Cotts were harassing one and the other and impeded a lot of work.</span> <span id="s254">Then a lot of people made business, they got their own collections to the gendarmerie.</span> <span id="s255">As they made business, they made stores, and they sold bread, cake, whatever.</span> <span id="s256">And they were very ingenious in making business.</span> <span id="s257">And, of course, at one time it was not thought it was a ghetto.</span> <span id="s258">It was just a business, but then came the other way.</span> <span id="s259">And they started to harass the people.</span> <span id="s260">We had the Jewish Police in Mogilev, that was not a very friendly people.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: What were they doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: They were police, and sometimes they abused the people.</span> <span id="s263">They abused by making money.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">They arrested people and people paid them, and then -- so I do not know very well about that because I was not active in that.</span> <span id="s265">But I heard what they told me was going on down in the city.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: So you stayed most of your years in Mogilev in Timisoara (ph) itself?</span> <span id="s267">A: That's it, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: Can you . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: I really was in the Timisoara (ph) and not very far from the Timisoara (ph) was a building where we lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: Yegendorf lived in the same building, and in a smaller building and he was living like a king.</span> <span id="s272">When he left his apartment, he was accompanied by two bodyguards.</span> <span id="s273">Nobody could talk to him, and he went to the office.</span> <span id="s274">In the office, he was king.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: Can you tell us a few things about your most difficult months or years in Timisoara (ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: Well, it was in the beginning.</span> <span id="s277">The beginning was very, very difficult because we didn't have anything, and we didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s278">I mean, we had to work, so we made whatever we could.</span> <span id="s279">Ingenious, we have invented a lot of things to make instruments and then with one -- the moment I had one lathe at hand, we started to repair another.</span> <span id="s280">So little by little, we became a very well organized factory, because we had a lathe and then the Timisoara (ph) -- as such and then we had one department we made smaller things.</span> <span id="s281">It was run by another colleague of mine very nicely.</span> <span id="s282">He made all kinds of screws and blades and so forth.</span> <span id="s283">And that was what we had to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: I remember reading at a certain point about a statue which was built in Mogilev.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: I don't know about that because it was done in very great secret.</span> <span id="s286">There was an architect, , who made the design, a statue, a cross.</span> <span id="s287">And they put the cross on front on a very high place, but I cannot tell you more about that because everything was done in secret.</span> <span id="s288">I couldn't find out.</span> <span id="s289">I was working in the lathe department, and I didn't know what's going in the carpenter department, because they made it over there.</span> <span id="s290">Mr. , an architect, and Yegendorf.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: Can you elaborate a little bit on Yegendorf's style of administration and his style on dealing on one hand with the Romanian authorities, on the other hand with the Jews interned in Mogilev?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: Yeah, that I can tell you.</span> <span id="s293">Yegendorf was a very good organizer.</span> <span id="s294">Very good.</span> <span id="s295">He knew a lot about administration, but he was not a very good engineer.</span> <span id="s296">And he was a man who knew so much, but when somebody came around who knew a little bit more, it was his -- he was an enemy of Yegendorf.</span> <span id="s297">Couldn't exist anymore.</span> <span id="s298">We as engineers, we were all young engineers, we know all the engineers always likes to talk about his days when he became an engineer.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">He never talked to us, he always dealt with us as in facto.</span> <span id="s300">You are in this department, you do what I tell you.</span> <span id="s301">He came around and my people made lighters, you know.</span> <span id="s302">And he went around and looked.</span> <span id="s303">And one day he caught me, but I didn't tell him what's going on.</span> <span id="s304">And he said to me, "What are they doing here?"</span> <span id="s305">And then I had to tell him they were lighters.</span> <span id="s306">And he was very angry, he said, "You do this and you sell it, and then I have to defend you.</span> <span id="s307">The gendarmerie will ask about it."</span> <span id="s308">I said, "Mr. Engineer, he is hungry.</span> <span id="s309">He doesn't do it all the time, he did it once."</span> <span id="s310">So when he caught somebody with a lighter, he punished him very severely.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: How?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: He said, "If you do it one more time, you lose the apartment.</span> <span id="s313">You lose your way in this building.</span> <span id="s314">You cannot live with us.</span> <span id="s315">And you lose the Timisoara (ph), and that means that."</span> <span id="s316">And he was not shy to threaten us with that.</span> <span id="s317">He was very severe, but, by the way, he was a good organizer.</span> <span id="s318">He dealt with the gendarmerie and the Prefect.</span> <span id="s319">I believe his people from the Prefect who were Jews, and Yegendorf's people around him who were Jews, they made business with one each other.</span> <span id="s320">And that was a big thing.</span> <span id="s321">They also paid money.</span> <span id="s322">For example, they bought big jewelry for the women of the Major, diamonds.</span> <span id="s323">And so they corrupted, and that was the way it went on.</span> <span id="s324">Sometimes he was very courageous, Yegendorf.</span> <span id="s325">When people attacked us or beat some Jews, he said, "You cannot beat these people because they are mine."</span> <span id="s326">One officer, Romanian officer, beat him and made him sick, but he was -- I must say that this officer was very severely dealt with by the Prefect.</span> <span id="s327">But he was courageous, he was a good organizer, but he was not a good man.</span> <span id="s328">Man with compassion, that he was not.</span> <span id="s329">And he always, always had in his mind was "I am number one."</span> <span id="s330">And he met people from Odessa, from the government, talked to him and he was by -- want so much influence that he made a scheme.</span> <span id="s331">He made a proposal, how to organize the Jews in grand scheme, in the whole of Ukraine to repair the industry and all the workshops and to make them workable.</span> <span id="s332">And that was he should be on the top of that, and we should be his servants.</span> <span id="s333">Now, I didn't know about that, only when I saw the documents.</span> <span id="s334">That in my mind made him very low.</span> <span id="s335">This is war -- I don't want to use it -- but it's like a war criminal because in times of war then your friends are your enemy.</span> <span id="s336">But what we had to do under the impression, under the pressure, we had to do, that is one thing.</span> <span id="s337">But when we voluntarily do something, this is different.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: I understand.</span> <span id="s339">Can you tell us about your experience toward the end of your stay in Mogilev?</span> <span id="s340">What happened when the Russians came, and how did you come back from Transnistria to Czernowitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: Well, Yegendorf, it was a time when was at odds with Antinesco (ph), and Antinesco sent him to Mogilev.</span> <span id="s342">Federman (ph) -- that we have, Federman was in Mogilev, and he talk only to Mr. Yegendorf.</span> <span id="s343">And he wasn't even visiting the city.</span> <span id="s344">Federman wasn't visiting the Timisoara (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: You never saw him in Mogilev?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s347">I saw him once when he into the apartment of engineer Yegendorf.</span> <span id="s348">Well, and then finally when Federman went back, we thought that now a lot of things are regulated.</span> <span id="s349">But one day, one day I came to there and Yegendorf was gone.</span> <span id="s350">Yegendorf secretly left.</span> <span id="s351">Federman worked out . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: His release?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: . . . his release.</span> <span id="s354">And Yegendorf and his wife left Mogilev secretly.</span> <span id="s355">And we were -- suddenly we were without a leader.</span> <span id="s356">You see, how bad he was, how good he was, but he was a leader.</span> <span id="s357">And it's like a father, the son is like the father.</span> <span id="s358">Suddenly there's no father, he left.</span> <span id="s359">And everything was very -- in a very bad situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: So he left without any warning?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: Without anything.</span> <span id="s362">Not saying a thing.</span> <span id="s363">And a couple of days later, we say the Germans had opened a big storage place.</span> <span id="s364">They had storage over there with sugar, flour, bread, everything.</span> <span id="s365">And they opened the doors and told the people, "Take whatever you want."</span> <span id="s366">My wife was also at that time left and went over there to take some sugar, some -- whatever it is she can take.</span> <span id="s367">And all the people went to take.</span> <span id="s368">Suddenly, the German came and started to shoot.</span> <span id="s369">A lot of people there were killed.</span> <span id="s370">Happily my wife was not wounded.</span> <span id="s371">And then they started the rumor, we saw that the Germans started to leave in cars.</span> <span id="s372">Well, there was -- I saw one car full of Romanian soldiers halted by the Germans.</span> <span id="s373">They forced the Romanian soldiers to get out, they got into the car and left.</span> <span id="s374">That I saw from the Timisoara (ph) on the highway.</span> <span id="s375">And so it was, it became a situation without -- they're shooting from all sides.</span> <span id="s376">From Soroki, from Romania they were shooting.</span> <span id="s377">And they were shooting from our parts, from the Mogilev.</span> <span id="s378">Then we saw on a mountain some people, and we were told these are the partisans.</span> <span id="s379">In a day the partisans started to work, and the Russians came in.</span> <span id="s380">The first group of soldiers.</span> <span id="s381">It was 4 o'clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s382">We were very lucky.</span> <span id="s383">We went to welcome the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">There was an officer, a Russian officer, a lieutenant.</span> <span id="s385">He said to us, "You are guilty that we have a war.</span> <span id="s386">You are a guilt -- because we don't want a war.</span> <span id="s387">We fight for you because we want to save you, but you are guilty."</span> <span id="s388">And that was the first greetings from the Russians, where the whole world thought when they will come we will be liberated.</span> <span id="s389">We will be free.</span> <span id="s390">The first thing was this anti-Semitic remark.</span> <span id="s391">And they started to take people from us to mobilize people.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: To draft them in the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s394">In the army.</span> <span id="s395">And I had to work.</span> <span id="s396">I couldn't leave.</span> <span id="s397">I wanted to go home.</span> <span id="s398">They told me, "You cannot leave.</span> <span id="s399">You have to work here.</span> <span id="s400">I will tell you when you can leave."</span> <span id="s401">And they never told me.</span> <span id="s402">So we were like forced labor, it was not very nice.</span> <span id="s403">And every day they came for us.</span> <span id="s404">It was finally I sent my wife before, she went home.</span> <span id="s405">I started to work over there, and then one day I decided whatever it will be, I go home, and I was lucky.</span> <span id="s406">My wife went to -- in Czernowitz, there is a factory where I was working before.</span> <span id="s407">And they gave her a letter that they need me.</span> <span id="s408">It was already under Russian regime.</span> <span id="s409">They gave her a letter that they need me, and I should be sent home from Mogilev.</span> <span id="s410">And with that letter, I went home.</span> <span id="s411">I came home and started to work over there, and after a couple of months I got sick.</span> <span id="s412">I got the trembling, I couldn't work.</span> <span id="s413">They made me an invalid for the time being.</span> <span id="s414">Then after I got my release from the hospital, they told me I started to look for getting out.</span> <span id="s415">Lucky I went to .</span> <span id="s416">They permitted us, whoever wants to leave can leave.</span> <span id="s417">So we made my publication, I went to Romania.</span> <span id="s418">I went to Bucharest.</span> <span id="s419">And there I started to make connection with my brothers.</span> <span id="s420">In the meantime, Yegendorf was also in Bucharest.</span> <span id="s421">He lived in a house of the Police Commissioner, Monalesko (ph).</span> <span id="s422">And I went to see him, he received me very friendly and said, "Well, everything will be all fine."</span> <span id="s423">And he told me had two daughters here, and he told me when I want to get in touch with my brothers, I should give him a letter, and he will send it to the daughters and they will contact him.</span> <span id="s424">So I gave him, but my brother contacted me before that.</span> <span id="s425">And that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: When did you leave Romania?</span> <span id="s427">A: I left Romania in '49 -- '48.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: Was it difficult?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s430">I had difficulties, but it was very difficult to get a job over there.</span> <span id="s431">And I met in the streets, I felt that I'm not welcome.</span> <span id="s432">Everybody saw, once I heard once, "Gendarmerie, gendarmerie, gendarmerie," and then the Communists were there in power, but I didn't have good luck.</span> <span id="s433">So I prefer to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: When did you arrive to this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: In this country, I arrived in '51.</span> <span id="s436">I went -- my brothers made -- because I couldn't get right away to America, I had to go to Cuba.</span> <span id="s437">In Cuba, I was three years of working over there, different kinds.</span> <span id="s438">And then I came to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: Thank you very much.</span> <span id="s440">A: You are welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Conclusion of Interview</span></p></body></html>
