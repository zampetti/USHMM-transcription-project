with Andre, Lucie and Joyce, who were born Zalc.</span> <span id="s12">All brother – a brother and two sisters, and it’s going to be – and it’s on July 23rd, 2009, in New York City, and it’s a continuation of the three separate interviews that were just done, talking about wartime experiences, and perhaps some of the experiences after the war, or some experiences before the war.</span> <span id="s13">So, I’d like to start with some of the things that you know about your parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: Yeah, so, my mother, she came from a family living in – in Latvia, and – not in Riga, she was Ventspila(ph).</span> <span id="s15">That’s a different city, it’s a ha-harbor in Latvia.</span> <span id="s16">And she had two brothers, and t-two sisters.</span> <span id="s17">And they owned a – a farm of cattle, a cattle farm up there.</span> <span id="s18">But – and of course in Latvia there was a – a certain amount of Jewish population.</span> <span id="s19">And that way Latvia also was a – belonged to Russia, but before it belonged to Russia, was a part of Germany, was a colony of Germany.</span> <span id="s20">And the people spoke German, and later they learned Russian from the Russian occupation, or beca – the Russian got the – got the territory.</span> <span id="s21">And she – her – they were selling cattle to Finland and Sweden and everywhere.</span> <span id="s22">But then the – the tsar of Russia had a brother and his name was Peter.</span> <span id="s23">And when they went – they went in war with Germany, a – a [indecipherable] there were – he – he was afraid of the Jewish population because in those days the Jews were friendly with the Germans, and they spoke Yiddish, which is an – an old German.</span> <span id="s24">It’s a dialect of Germany from – from 500 years ago.</span> <span id="s25">So Peter decided, with his brother, the tsar of Russia, they decided to – to take the Jews and send them to the other part of Russia by the I-Iranian border, by the Caspian Sea, by Azrahan(ph), by Baku, Azrahan(ph).</span> <span id="s26">And they were sent there.</span> <span id="s27">And up there they – they started a new life, with different businesses to survive.</span> <span id="s28">And the gr – the grandfather, my mother’s father started because there – up there is a lot of fish.</span> <span id="s29">The – the caviar comes from there, and the – and the best fish.</span> <span id="s30">And the oils from the whales, too, which was like, very important in those days.</span> <span id="s31">So he start the factory of smoking fish, and he was very successful with that because in those days, in the first World War, the Russian army had no C-rations like today, and they used to u-use a piece of smoked fish and a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s32">That was the food of the Russian soldier.</span> <span id="s33">And – and he couldn’t produce enough smoked fish for the government, so we’re – the government wanted they should produce more fish, they’re working day and night.</span> <span id="s34">So he complained about it.</span> <span id="s35">So they told him, don’t worry about it, if you’re short of labor, we give you workers.</span> <span id="s36">So they gave him Turkish prisoners and German prisoners and Austrian prisoners from the first World War, and they used to work in the factory helping to smoke the fish.</span> <span id="s37">And – and two prisoners fell in love with my aunts, and they married my aunts, and when the revolution of Russia started, the war with the Germans and Russians stopped, because the Germans made the Russian revolution, I don’t know if you know that, yeah.</span> <span id="s38">Because they got Lenin in Switzerland, and they gave him money and they send him back to Russia to make the revolution.</span> <span id="s39">And when they made the revolution, the war stopped.</span> <span id="s40">So those – those two prisoners took their wives with them to Germany, and then went to United States.</span> <span id="s41">And one uncle – an aunt went to Belgium.</span> <span id="s42">And my mother, she was young and she wasn’t married, so she stayed with – with her folks, and the two brothers went to the Russian army.</span> <span id="s43">And after the war, my mother was the only daughter home with the – with the two brothers.</span> <span id="s44">They went back to Latvia from Azrahan(ph).</span> <span id="s45">But the parents died in Azrahan(ph).</span> <span id="s46">They got – what’s that disease?</span> <span id="s47">The fever –</span></p> <p><span id="s48">L: Typhoid?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">L: Typhoid?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: Typhoid.</span> <span id="s52">They got typhoid, and they died from that disease.</span> <span id="s53">Typhus, that’s called, and a – typhoid, yeah, in English.</span> <span id="s54">So they died from that disease, so my mother became an orphan.</span> <span id="s55">So the Russians go – the Russian government gave a visa, as was already after the revolution, b-because she was an orphan, they gave a visa to go to her sister’s.</span> <span id="s56">One lived in the States and one lived in Belgium.</span> <span id="s57">So she went to Belgium to go to the States, and by going to Belgium, she stayed by that other sister and she married my father.</span> <span id="s58">And that’s – that’s the wa – we were born in Belgium from that wedding, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s59">L: And we had –</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: – my sister Joyce was born in France during the wartime, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: Where was your father from?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: My father was Polish, from Łódź, Łódź.</span> <span id="s63">I mean, he came to Belgium too, but he didn’t had his birth certificate from Poland, he couldn’t get the birth certificate, he had to go back to Poland to serve in the reserve.</span> <span id="s64">In Poland, after the – after the – being in the army, he has to be four or five years in the reserve.</span> <span id="s65">So h-he – he couldn’t go back there because he was married, he had no way of going back there.</span> <span id="s66">So he couldn’t get married officially in Belgium, so he was just married by the Jewish law, yeah.</span> <span id="s67">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s68">L: But he was from Łódź.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: He was from Łódź, yeah, but he served in the Polish army in the war with Pilsudski.</span> <span id="s70">That’s the Germa – the Polish general who freed Poland from the Russians, and Poland invaded Ukraine – Kiev, Poland took Kiev.</span> <span id="s71">But after that, the Polish lost the war, and the Russians came all the way to the capital of Poland.</span> <span id="s72">And things got very bad in Poland, and so he left Poland and he came to Belgium –</span></p> <p><span id="s73">L: Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: And he didn’t serve in –</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: Is that why your name is Umal(ph) on your –</span></p> <p><span id="s76">L: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: Yeah, and that’s why in Belgium, I didn’t have my father’s name, I was named Umal(ph) after my mother.</span> <span id="s78">And being that I was under my mother’s name, I became a Belgium citizen automatically, because he came from – from foreign por – parents in Belgium, he didn’t had the Belgium nationality, he had to go, he had to serve in the Belgium army to become a Belgium.</span> <span id="s79">So I was a Belgium automatically, I – in this coun – I am consi – I was considered the son of the King Albert, King Albert, I was his son.</span> <span id="s80">I never seen him myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">L: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: Lucie, you remember what it was like arriving in France, you – what – going to the different camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">L: Well, we were on a train going to France, and I think a bomb fell on the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: About two weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">L: And it took us a long time, and we had to get off the train to go to the bathroom and all that.</span> <span id="s86">And when the bomb fell on the train, it divided the train in two, and part of the train was left behind, and we were lucky, our train went on.</span> <span id="s87">And that’s how we got to other station.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: To the south of France.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">L: And that’s – it’s unbelievable, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: And – and also by the – when we traveled to France, they arrested the German fifth column, you know fifth column?</span> <span id="s91">They had German spies,

put you in – in a camp, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: When you went to the first camp, were you all together, or were you separated?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">L: I think we were to

Brenz(ph) too, were together, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">L: Brenz(ph), Recebedou, we were together.</span> <span id="s103">Even in Rivesaltes in the beginning, we were together.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: And then they separated us.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">L: Right.</span> <span id="s106">And then when Joyce was born, that’s when we, you know, we escaped out.</span> <span id="s107">I was there for quite a while.</span> <span id="s108">And which illow(ph) are they making the museum, is it K?</span> <span id="s109">I think I was in that illow(ph) –</span></p> <p><span

and everything, but I think that was around the holidays, and that’s when I remember.</span> <span id="s127">I even remember smuggling out a little piece of bread in my underwear for my mother, because she always saved everything for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: And – and in camp too, there was certain rumors going around that if you volunteer to go to work in Germany, you get more food, and you get better things, and a lot of people volunteered for it.</span> <span id="s129">I don’t know if they went –</span></p> <p><span id="s130">L: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: – to

in France, in that town, there wasn’t – we had toilets, you know, where we lived.</span> <span id="s246">But a lot of houses had no toilets and in the morning they used to come to the public toilet.</span> <span id="s247">They had like – at night they used to go in pots, like a bucket, and in the morning they used to come to public toilet, empty everything in there.</span> <span id="s248">The public toilet was very important –</span></p> <p><span id="s249">L: Very rural.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: – because there wasn’t – a lot of houses had no public toilets in France.</span> <span id="s251">In that town where we lived [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: Okay, what do you want to say?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">J: She also hid her wedding

Oradour-sur-Glane in France, they put all the population to church, and they burned them all, and they machine-gunned everything.</span> <span id="s260">And we were like minutes away from something like that, too, because the Germans wanted to get even for their train, because the train went to Italy, used to carry German troops, ammunition.</span> <span id="s261">And used to carry women, who went to see their husbands in Italy.</span> <span id="s262">And the women who went to see their husbands in Italy brought their babies in there, and when the train derailed, they all got killed.</span> <span id="s263">And so wa-was a – the Germans wanted to get even with that, but they were a little bit afraid when the saw the French ta – ta – to do crazy things, because there was too ma – too much sa – resistance, too much resistance in the woods, and they know if they do something very bad, they’re going to pay for it in fra – in the south of France, because in the – in the mountains, they cut off the – the roads, and they – they would have killed a lot of German.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">L: Yeah, so that’s about it, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A:

German, the French, that was the – because one French teacher, he – he – you cou – I could see in his eye the hate, eh?</span> <span id="s309">I could see in his eye when he talked to me that he – he – that he hated me, you know, it’s easy to see, y-you understand me?</span> <span id="s310">Yeah.</span> <span id="s311">And the Germans came when they took too long, during the war, they took too long, the Germans.</span> <span id="s312">And when they came, they came to Tresse, when they took too long, then they came from Stalingrad, the German troops.</span> <span id="s313">And they needed to

things?</span> <span id="s319">He says, we going back to Russia, there’s nothing there in Russia.</span> <span id="s320">There’s no nails, there’s no hammers, there’s no screwdriver.</span> <span id="s321">He bought a lot of tools.</span> <span id="s322">So the next day a-again, he came to school and I went with him, and the German officers.</span> <span id="s323">So the – the third day, the third day he said to me – the – the guy in charge of the German troops, he must have been a brigadier general or something, he says, he would like to meet you, because we told him we have a kid who

are?</span> <span id="s337">I says, I thought you were joking.</span> <span id="s338">And then the officers, they got quiet, they didn’t laugh.</span> <span id="s339">So I see it’s – I told – I saw it’s serious.</span> <span id="s340">So I say, what do you say that for?</span> <span id="s341">He said, because they went to Heidelberg, to the best universities, he said, and they don’t speak another language, they only speak German, he says.</span> <span id="s342">And that’s why we lose the war, he said to me.</span> <span id="s343">The – the guy in charge.</span></p> <p><span

with them.</span> <span id="s350">And then he – he told the officer to drive me home, so he drove me back to Tresse.</span> <span id="s351">And I came home, I brought back a bread and some other food that they gave me, you know, they gave me some food, the Germans.</span> <span id="s352">So I never understood that he predicted that they’re gonna lose the war, this – this ger – this German, the big
