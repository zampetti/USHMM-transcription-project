id="s12">I was born in Ashoshok (ph), Poland at that time, in January 22, 1922.</span> <span id="s13">My father's name was Hierr (ph) Shavival (ph), my mother's name was Ibella (ph).</span> <span id="s14">I was born in Ashoshok (ph) and raised there until the war, I was staying there.</span> <span id="s15">Then when the war start.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: Let's talk a little bit about your family life, your memories before the war, what was it like living in Ashoshok (ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: The town was a small town but we had a big family from both sides, from my mother's side and from my father's side.</span> <span id="s18">We was very devoted to each other and personally, my own family, my mother was born, there was four children, one boy and three girls.</span> <span id="s19">My father was a tailor, he used to work in the house and we had a nice life, a quiet life.</span> <span id="s20">We enjoyed our life and this was all a part of, I went to school when I was six years old, with my sister Pegilla (ph), we went to Wonklis (ph) and we went to a Hebrew school and we went to a Polish school.</span> <span id="s21">I learned Polish, I had seven grades, Polish language, and then Hebrew I learned too.</span> <span id="s22">When I finished the seven class school, public school, there wasn't high school in this time, we had to go in a bigger town, like to Vilna, this was the nearest town near Ashoshok (ph).</span> <span id="s23">But we couldn't afford all this, to go there.</span> <span id="s24">After a little while, that was not really, I finished 36 or 37, I don't remember exactly, this school.</span> <span id="s25">And I used to help my father, I learned how to sew, and then the war start.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: Do you have fond memories of living in this small town?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: Yes, we belonged to organizations they used to call Betar (ph) and we used to come all the young people, there was dancing there, and we have a nice time.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: What was the overall focus of Betar, why did you join it?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: This what we planned to go someday to Israel.</span> <span id="s30">This was our organization what was working for Israel and we were planning someday to go there.</span> <span id="s31">That's why we belonged, and we used to come the young people, we used to come in one place, singing and dancing and that's all.</span> <span id="s32">This was the all the entertainment what we had there.</span> <span id="s33">Sometimes we used to have movies.</span> <span id="s34">They used to come from another town and we used to see a picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: The organization though is politically oriented, did they teach you certain things?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: Yeah, they used to talk about this all the time, to teach us about Israel, what kind of life is there, how it's going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: I know that the lifestyle there was very different than the lifestyle here so I'm trying to get a sense of, I'm trying to picture it, maybe you can help me.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: Well it was much, how can I say, it's much different how they're raising here the youngsters and by us.</span> <span id="s39">It was a family, a big family lay, we used to do everything by ourselves, you know because my mother didn't have too much time.</span> <span id="s40">There you have to shop and cook and clean, everything by yourself, to take care for yourself.</span> <span id="s41">When we grow up, we use to, like teenagers we used to help the mother, everything in the house.</span> <span id="s42">We used to cook, it's not like here, you go out and you buy ready whatever you want, too lazy to cook, you don't want to shop, you don't want to cook, you don't want to clean, you're doing something, you're idling somebody, but this wasn't by us, this was complicated.</span> <span id="s43">We had to do everything by ourselves and let's say it used to come, here whatever they want, whatever they need, they're going shopping for clothes.</span> <span id="s44">We used to have clothes only on the holidays twice a year.</span> <span id="s45">Whatever we need, shoes, a dress, a coat.</span> <span id="s46">Not really like things what people buying here, let's be, lay there, for occasions, no such a thing this occasions.</span> <span id="s47">This is the way.</span> <span id="s48">When I went to school I had a uniform, you know what I used to where everytime to school, when I used to come at home I used to change for our plain dress.</span> <span id="s49">Maybe I had three or four dresses, that's all.</span> <span id="s50">We didn't wear pants or sneakers or something like this.</span> <span id="s51">Very plain.</span> <span id="s52">But with the food, we had our own home, we had a garden we used to plant, you know, like potatoes, onions, cucumbers, everything we had for ourself.</span> <span id="s53">This was the life but we were very happy.</span> <span id="s54">We had a family, we enjoyed this.</span> <span id="s55">We used to go on Shabbos (ph), we used to go to a temple, not a temple, a congregation, a Shabbos (ph) type.</span> <span id="s56">And it was a very religious place, orthodox place, we didn't know no other things.</span> <span id="s57">We enjoy our lives, I miss the life.</span> <span id="s58">Used to come in the Shabbos (ph), Friday night, we had our dinner Friday Shabbos (ph), you know, the whole family used to sit around the table and we enjoyed the meal, with playing, with everything.</span> <span id="s59">It was wonderful.</span> <span id="s60">I wish this wouldn't happen.</span> <span id="s61">Alright, people are dying, they wouldn't be alive already by this time but still the years what we spent for the Holocaust in the woods, all over, in the ghettos, people had a life, they could live with their parents, they could live with their family to enjoy.</span> <span id="s62">When I got married we didn't have nobody, no mother, no father.</span> <span id="s63">When I gave birth to my children, nobody was with me like I was with my daughter.</span> <span id="s64">Sorry.</span> <span id="s65">My husband is coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: Why don't we stop to take a moment.</span> <span id="s67">I'm not sure you mentioned how many brothers and sisters you had.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: I had one brother, he was the oldest, and we was three sisters, that's all, this was our whole family.</span> <span id="s69">Then I had uncles, aunts, they had children, a lot of them, from both sides.</span> <span id="s70">I can't even remember exactly how many there was, but they can't think about this, to tell you if you needed exactly the amount, no.</span> <span id="s71">Then the community was most a Jewish community and it was very nice, the people.</span> <span id="s72">We was living like a quiet life in the community.</span> <span id="s73">When I went to the Polish school, there was anti semites, there was.</span> <span id="s74">They used to say all the time to us, go to Palestine, at that time it wasn't Israel it was Palestine.</span> <span id="s75">Every Jew should go to Palestine, not to stay here.</span> <span id="s76">Naturally they used to come with sandwiches, they used to come with non kosher food, so they wanted all the time, we should taste their food, and they knew that we're not allowed.</span> <span id="s77">They always start with us, you know, about this.</span> <span id="s78">They used to teach on Saturdays too.</span> <span id="s79">The Jewish people, the Jewish girls and the boys, we didn't go there.</span> <span id="s80">We used to take by them the lessons after, you know, on Sunday.</span> <span id="s81">Sunday was off for everybody but not for us.</span> <span id="s82">We used to keep Saturday all the time.</span> <span id="s83">That was the life.</span> <span id="s84">We had our Saturdays all the time, everything was closed by us, we didn't cook, we didn't clean, we didn't work all day, we didn't do nothing, this was a quiet day.</span> <span id="s85">Naturally we didn't have no telephones, no air conditions, no nothing, nothing at all, so it wasn't, to disconnect something or prepare, it was prepared.</span> <span id="s86">We cooked for Saturday, we didn't warm up, we didn't do nothing, just a quiet day, just the men, just everybody used to go the synagogue to play and doing nothing.</span> <span id="s87">At night after Shabbos, we used to go , like in the days when it was nice we used to go walking and like this we used to come to a warm place, everybody, like the organizations, we used to come and to sing and to dance, that's all, this was life.</span> <span id="s88">We used to go to school, naturally to make homework so the days in the middle of the week, it was occupied, we didn't do nothing.</span> <span id="s89">Only on Sunday, so Sunday we used to work, we used to do things in the house to help the parents, to help do things.</span> <span id="s90">This was the look of the life, can't compare here.</span> <span id="s91">First of all this was 50 years ago, more than 50 years.</span> <span id="s92">So everything was not everything goes, like medication, everything goes ahead, at that time they didn't know nothing.</span> <span id="s93">Who knew about hearts, about heart attacks, about the applications.</span> <span id="s94">A person died, he died, we didn't know from what or when.</span> <span id="s95">You see it was one hospital in town and one doctor, and this doctor was on everything.</span> <span id="s96">So you can imagine what kind of life it was, but we were healthy, everybody was healthy.</span> <span id="s97">And we used to eat everything, whatever it was.</span> <span id="s98">You couldn't pick.</span> <span id="s99">And that's all, that was the life, until the war start.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: Did you have Polish friends, did your family have contact with Polish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s102">It used to, first of all we had school.</span> <span id="s103">We had to get the homework for Saturday to prepare for Monday.</span> <span id="s104">So we was with them, in contact.</span> <span id="s105">They used to live, they were all neighbors, not far from us.</span> <span id="s106">And the parents, my father used to make work for the people, for the Polish people, so he knew them, a lot of them.</span> <span id="s107">In fact, when the war start, we used to hire by them, a few of them, it wasn't too many.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: So you had decent relationships?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: Yes, yes, I wouldn't say no, yes.</span> <span id="s110">They used to come, every place was like a market, they used to come, the Polish people, to sell things like eggs, butter, cheeses, food, all kinds of things and we used to buy from them, a lot of things.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: So you weren't afraid of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s113">We used to live with them fairly, you know, I would say, close with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: One more question, do you remember, certain things your parents taught you, values, or when you were being abused in school, what did they teach you, how did they help you?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: Well it wasn't really abuse like in the school, they never talked about it, they never talked about it.</span> <span id="s116">In the beginning we was going to a Hebrew school, so it was only Jewish people, you know, and they teach us with everybody.</span> <span id="s117">But then when I went to the Polish school, they was nice too, the Polish teachers, they were nice.</span> <span id="s118">They didn't never see the difference between a Jew or a Polish student, we was the same by them.</span> <span id="s119">What else?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: I was just wondering if there was anything you could remember that really stuck with you in terms of things your parents taught you?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: I don't remember such a thing, only one thing when we used to go out let's say, they used to say, "you are coming and this and this time you have to be home, not later".</span> <span id="s122">If we have to come home sometimes later, they used to take off the shoes, they shouldn't here, we open up the door and then we walk in there.</span> <span id="s123">Otherwise everything was, whatever they used to say, it was dinner Shabbos, we have to be by the table, the whole family.</span> <span id="s124">You never can say, "no", to them, or "I wanted to do this", or "I wanted to come late", or "I want to do this or that".</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: Were you a good kid?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: I would say, not a bad.</span> <span id="s127">I used to listen to the parents, whatever they used to say, and I did whatever they used to say.</span> <span id="s128">It wasn't broke by us, it wasn't such a thing, like to move out from the house when you are a teenager, or are growing up.</span> <span id="s129">You move out from the house when you got married.</span> <span id="s130">So this way also, we used to live together in one place.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: Now when did life begin to change for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: When the war start, what kind of changes could be?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: Up until that point, had you heard about what was going on in Germany, did you know who Hitler was?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: Yeah, we find out when it start in Germany in 1939, we knew already that he's killing, that he's doing things, but we couldn't believe, why you should come to us to do this, why?</span> <span id="s135">What we did to him?</span> <span id="s136">Why you should do this?</span> <span id="s137">Then when they start to come in, you know, the people from Germany, they pass by our town and they told us, but still we couldn't believe, till they came to us and it start, the killing.</span> <span id="s138">When we saw with our eyes, why you should do this?</span> <span id="s139">Why?</span> <span id="s140">What we did wrong in our lives?</span> <span id="s141">Why he's going to kill the small children, the little babies and they didn't grow up?</span> <span id="s142">Why?</span> <span id="s143">Till the last minute, till they start to kill, we saw what he's going to do.</span> <span id="s144">And he said to the people that when they start to take out, for Ashoshok (ph), for the men, and they did the graves for themselves, and they said to us, to the women, to the children, that he's taking them at war, really he did the nice war.</span> <span id="s145">They dig the graves for themselves, so they lied to us, we didn't, we couldn't believe.</span> <span id="s146">Then when they killed everybody in Ashoshok (ph), and it was left very little people, when we went to London.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: Okay, I need to stop you because I think we're jumping ahead a little bit.</span> <span id="s148">You say, "when the war started in 1939".</span> <span id="s149">Initially the Germans didn't come in, did they, first didn't you go under Russian?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: Okay, maybe you can tell me a little bit what happened and how your life maybe was different with the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: Well first of all, the Russians came and whatever they saw by us, they was wondering, like things what we had, they didn't had.</span> <span id="s153">They had a miserable life too, there in the Russia.</span> <span id="s154">You know, they belonged to the government, they wasn't like a boss for himself, for themselves.</span> <span id="s155">They're working for them, and whatever they used to give him, clothes, to eat, they had to do this.</span> <span id="s156">And when they came to us everything was, we had, you know, normal life, they was wondering.</span> <span id="s157">They start to buy and to take things what they didn't have, like watches, they didn't saw.</span> <span id="s158">We did not buy ourself really expensive things.</span> <span id="s159">But they changed first of all the language, we didn't know.</span> <span id="s160">My father knew, he was in the first war in 1914, he was at the war, so he knew how to speak Russia, French.</span> <span id="s161">Of course, he was with those people there so he spoke to them, he used to do things for them.</span> <span id="s162">Really we didn't have, we couldn't go like to buy things what we want, not food, not like we had for the Polish people.</span> <span id="s163">Really for the Polish people, we was our own boss.</span> <span id="s164">My father worked in the house and everything we had for ourselves.</span> <span id="s165">And they changed all that, they took over everything.</span> <span id="s166">All the, you know, the stores, we didn't have no more stores for ourselves, they took all that.</span> <span id="s167">So this was a lot of change.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: Did your father continue his work?</span> <span id="s169">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: Did they allow you to go to synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: Yeah, the first time, yeah.</span> <span id="s172">We didn't know about this in the first time.</span> <span id="s173">But later on, later on we found out that it's going to go down everything for them.</span> <span id="s174">In fact, some people, they was afraid, I mean whoever had, by them, maybe you know about this, about communism by them.</span> <span id="s175">This means they belonged to the government, they couldn't say about something about the government or something for themselves, nothing.</span> <span id="s176">This was like they were occupied, they were like in a jail.</span> <span id="s177">So we didn't feel comfortable to live and I almost felt like this, but we had to get used to it.</span> <span id="s178">They put up, right away they made the stores should belong, they took from the owners and that they belonged to the government, everything, and they put up their own people to work.</span> <span id="s179">So it was different but we had to get used to it, to this life.</span> <span id="s180">It wasn't that for long.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: Did you have to learn Russian?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: I haven't got the time for this, but soon the Germans came.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: Do you remember what happened when the Germans came, can you describe that to me?</span> <span id="s184">A: What happened?</span> <span id="s185">Before they occupied our town, we weren't, like the killing, the shouting, and then they came on the motorcycles in our town.</span> <span id="s186">We was very scared, we was all of us was in the houses, we was afraid to go out.</span> <span id="s187">They came and they start to talk I think, in German.</span> <span id="s188">My father understood German.</span> <span id="s189">It's a little bit similar to Yiddish.</span> <span id="s190">But not too much, a little bit, you can understand what they are talking about.</span> <span id="s191">That it's going to be a normal life they start to say, and we're all going to work together, everything is going to be alright.</span> <span id="s192">In fact my father worked for them for a little while, until they killed him.</span> <span id="s193">So when they, I don't remember, a few months later they started killing.</span> <span id="s194">We didn't have no ghetto at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: What was the life like in the interim, did they make you do certain things differently, were there all kinds of new rules?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: I don't think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: Did you have to walk on the street, did you have to wear a yellow star?</span> <span id="s198">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: That's what I'm trying to get.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: Yeah, we wore yellow stars so they should know who is a Jew, and we walked on the street too, not on the sidewalk, between the street and the sidewalk.</span> <span id="s201">This was different, because they had to know that we are Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: Were the schools closed?</span> <span id="s203">Were the synagogues closed?</span> <span id="s204">A: No, not at that time, no they didn't close yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: And what about the local people, the Polish, Lithuanian, any of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: They start right away to put them to work with the Germans.</span> <span id="s207">They are brothers, they are not Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: Let's stop and change the tape.</span> <span id="s209">When we begin I want you to tell me a little bit more about what your life was like when the Germans came in, and this is now we know as summer of 1941.</span> <span id="s210">We're not starting yet, but also what year, before you knew Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: Why you have to change?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: He has to put in a new tape and then when you put in a new tape you have to set it up, the first one was over.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: I'm trying to get a sense of what your life was like when the Germans came in, how you spent your time, whether they were nasty, whether they treated you okay, whether people were being beaten, if your former school friends or people you did business with, the Polish people, did they still talk to you?</span> <span id="s216">What was it like?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: It was different.</span> <span id="s218">They try and, I mean they wasn't so friendly like it used to be, they knew about this, that we're going to get killed, they knew about this.</span> <span id="s219">And all the time, before the war they didn't want us, they send us to Palestine, especially now they want us to be killed.</span> <span id="s220">To take away everything what we had, to get rid of us, to take our houses, to take the clothes, to take jewelry, to take everything.</span> <span id="s221">We had our jewelry to hide in a place in our house.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Before the war when they came they didn't find nothing.</span> <span id="s223">They dig it out.</span> <span id="s224">And they took away everything.</span> <span id="s225">They knew about this and they used to say, "you're going to get killed anyway, the Germans will kill you".</span> <span id="s226">And they did, they knew about this.</span> <span id="s227">They hurried and they saw the digging, when they dig the graves, they saw how they getting killed.</span> <span id="s228">We hide the knives.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: And how did the Germans treat you, how did you spend your time in this few months?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: We didn't go no place, we were sitting home most of the time.</span> <span id="s231">We was afraid to go, to get killed.</span> <span id="s232">They could kill us any place and any part of the day.</span> <span id="s233">Let's say, I walked, you would say something to them, if they didn't like, they could kill you.</span> <span id="s234">Who could stop them, they came for this.</span> <span id="s235">So what kind of life, we was happy that we had something to eat.</span> <span id="s236">The Polish people they used to come and that time, in the morning was a change with everything.</span> <span id="s237">We used to give them something, you know, like a dress or material or something for food.</span> <span id="s238">We was starving for food already, to survive, that was the life.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: So some of the Polish people were sort of helping you?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: Yeah, they helped in some things, they brought food for us but it's not for nothing, we pay them, it's not with money so we paid with something else, or with jewelry, or with something, clothes, stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: But they were also taking your things?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: Oh yeah, oh yeah.</span> <span id="s243">When the Germans throwed us out from the houses, right away they took everything.</span> <span id="s244">They didn't take nothing what we could take.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: Were people being beaten or killed on the streets during this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: Yeah, it was a few people they killed.</span> <span id="s247">It was one person alive, homeless person, so they killed him right away.</span> <span id="s248">And this what I remember.</span> <span id="s249">Maybe they killed other people too.</span> <span id="s250">But it wasn't already interested to find out because we were thinking about our lifes, that we're going to get killed soon.</span> <span id="s251">So it wasn't to ask who was killed or who was going to get killed because I was, we was already on the line to get killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: Do you remember what your family talked about, if you had any plans?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: What kind plans?</span> <span id="s254">Not lives at all.</span> <span id="s255">We was thinking only that they were going to make a ghetto and we were going to be in ghetto, but by us it was not ghetto, right away they killed the people.</span> <span id="s256">Like we went later to Radun and we was there living for ten months so we was living there in ghetto but not like by us.</span> <span id="s257">We was the first one to kill.</span> <span id="s258">I don't know why this happened right away, I have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: Tell me what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: What happened in Ashoshok (ph) you want?</span> <span id="s261">When they throwed us out from the house, my older sister, this one which was alive, she was alive at that time, it was before the holidays, she was married shortly, and she went with her husband to his parents there for the holidays, so we was home, me and my sister and my mother, my father.</span> <span id="s262">My father went away because everybody said that, "they going to take the men, first the men, and the women, we'll see what's going to be later".</span> <span id="s263">So he went away and he wasn't with us together so I was only with my mother, with my sister, the younger one.</span> <span id="s264">And then came my husband, he was my boyfriend there, he was from the same town.</span> <span id="s265">He came and the Lithuanians with the, together with the Germans, they throwed us out and they took us, they beat up my mother because she wanted to take something, I don't remember, and we went there to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s266">From the other street was my mother's family, we met them all that day there in the synagogue, we was all together, we was there for two days I think, two days and two nights.</span> <span id="s267">They took a lot of people from our end of town, this calls Alkinique (ph), if you need the name, I don't think so, if you need the name, came people too, and we were all brought together until they took us on the big place, you know, on the marketplace, and from there they started shooting.</span> <span id="s268">So first they took the men, again, all the men, and they said that they taking them to work but my father wasn't there, so they took all the men and they killed them, naturally.</span> <span id="s269">Then they came for the women, it was like afternoon, late afternoon, and they took us all and they put us in parts, like I was with my mother, with my sister, with my grandmother, with my aunt.</span> <span id="s270">I had three or four aunts.</span> <span id="s271">And soon we was starting to walk already, came this man, the Lithuanian man.</span> <span id="s272">He was a policeman.</span> <span id="s273">He came over to me, my husband, he wasn't my husband that time, he took him also from the line from the men and he made sure that he killed him.</span> <span id="s274">He said that he's taking him to kill him, and he let him go.</span> <span id="s275">So before he said to him, take my girl.</span> <span id="s276">So he knew me because he used to come to my father, he used to do work for him.</span> <span id="s277">So he took, because I'd be from my head, and he said, "what are you doing here, come with me".</span> <span id="s278">And he took me out and he put me again on the place, on the marketplace, and he said to me, "soon it's going to get dark, go away, run away from here, go wherever you want to go".</span> <span id="s279">He said, "your boyfriend went away to Aladarin (ph), go also".</span> <span id="s280">So when it was dark, and they went away and they killed them.</span> <span id="s281">The whole family.</span> <span id="s282">So I didn't have nobody from my family, I took one girl, a neighbor girl, and she went with me.</span> <span id="s283">She left with her sister, mother, but then they went away too, at night.</span> <span id="s284">So we was walking the whole night and we came back to the same time.</span> <span id="s285">Instead to go there to Radun, we came back to Ashoshok (ph).</span> <span id="s286">So one Pollack was walking in a field, you know.</span> <span id="s287">So I came to him and I said, "where to go", and he said, "where are you going, they killed everybody in Ashoshok (ph), why are you going there back"?</span> <span id="s288">I said, "I don't know where to go".</span> <span id="s289">He said, "go to this area, go to that area".</span> <span id="s290">So I was walking, both of us, and we came to Radun, we came to my sister there where she was.</span> <span id="s291">What I could do?</span> <span id="s292">What we can do?</span> <span id="s293">Always sit and play and clap, we lost that.</span> <span id="s294">Oh god.</span> <span id="s295">Then my father came there, we met him, and we was all together for the ten months.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: Where was your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: My brother was by the Germans, he was at war, when the war start, they took him to Damnia (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: The Polish army.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s300">Then he was, the Polish army was nothing for them, so the Germans, the Germans took him to Germany to our concentration camp and he was there, we was survived, he was liberated by the English army.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: At the time of this massacre, you were hiding, did you hear the shots or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: In Ashoshok (ph)?</span> <span id="s303">No, we wasn't hiding, we was on the market, we hide everything, where we could go?</span> <span id="s304">We couldn't go no place, and we didn't know what was going on.</span> <span id="s305">It was so stupid to believe them, that they are working.</span> <span id="s306">You understand, we couldn't believe that they were going to kill us.</span> <span id="s307">Till they killed, till they killed .</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: Who were the people responsible, were they Germans, were they Lithuanians?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: They was working together.</span> <span id="s310">The Lithuanians, they helped them.</span> <span id="s311">The Germans was maybe two or three people all together for them.</span> <span id="s312">But the rest was the Lithuanians, and they was very bad, very bad people.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: And some of them were people you knew before?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: No.</span> <span id="s315">No.</span> <span id="s316">They were Lithuanians, they came from Lithuania, we was Polish, we had the Pollacks.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: Were they involved in this also?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: The Pollacks, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s319">Some of them, they was working together with them too.</span> <span id="s320">Q: And when the women were all shot, could you hear the noises and everything?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: No, I didn't hear nothing and I didn't understand nothing that time.</span> <span id="s322">You know, like I was, I don't know from where, from another world.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: So you met your sister, your father, in Radun?</span> <span id="s324">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: And was your boyfriend there as well?</span> <span id="s326">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: So maybe you can describe for me, well let me just clarify one thing.</span> <span id="s328">This took place, you said, on the holidays.</span> <span id="s329">Can you give me, this is Rosh Hashanah?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: Yeah, Rosh Hashanah night, they took us, supposed to be start the holidays, then they took us from the houses and they put us in Eshule (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: This is 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: 1941.</span> <span id="s333">After Rosh Hashanah, it's supposed to be Monday, Tuesday; Wednesday we was on the place, on the marketplace, and Thursday they start killing, and Friday they finished the women.</span> <span id="s334">That's all, and this was the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: Now maybe you can tell me about what was happening in Radun?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: Well in Radun, we, what we did, we didn't do nothing, well the men they used to go to work for the Germans, but there was a ghetto.</span> <span id="s337">And some of the women they used to take to work too.</span> <span id="s338">I didn't work, no.</span> <span id="s339">Then after ten months, somebody told us that this and this night, they were going to start to kill the people.</span> <span id="s340">They were going to close up the ghetto, altogether, and they were going to start to kill.</span> <span id="s341">So we knew about this already and at night, at night we run away.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: Can you tell me a little bit about life in the ghetto in Radun, the conditions?</span> <span id="s343">One second.</span> <span id="s344">A: Well it was, how can I told you.</span> <span id="s345">We was one, two.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: If you can tell me a little bit about life in the ghetto, what the conditions?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: Well there was four families in one house, and the house had I think, one bedroom or two bedrooms.</span> <span id="s348">We were sleeping on the floors, we were sleeping, you know, we was cooking together.</span> <span id="s349">It was terrible, but we were happy that we are alive.</span> <span id="s350">Who thought about us, who think about this, that I haven't got what to eat, or it's not comfortable, or to wash ourself, to take a shower.</span> <span id="s351">What kind of showers?</span> <span id="s352">What kind of baths?</span> <span id="s353">We washed up and that's all in our part, and that's it.</span> <span id="s354">We was happy with this what we had.</span> <span id="s355">As long as giving us life, we had the life.</span> <span id="s356">It's not going to happen like in Ashoshok (ph), right away to kill.</span> <span id="s357">You see, we had time a little bit here, to think about things.</span> <span id="s358">We knew about this, that they were going to kill here too, but we had no choice.</span> <span id="s359">As long they give us life here, so we lived here, where is to go?</span> <span id="s360">We had no place where to go.</span> <span id="s361">In the woods?</span> <span id="s362">How can you live in the woods at night, in day?</span> <span id="s363">I mean when it's cold, it's raining.</span> <span id="s364">We lived there, we lived like this, we went through this.</span> <span id="s365">So we had no choice, we had to live, till it came the time when we find out that it's going to make like he was doing, he did in Ashoshok (ph), so that time we ran away.</span> <span id="s366">We ran away, our family, what there was.</span> <span id="s367">My father, my sister with a husband, me, my boyfriend.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">And we ran away, that's all.</span> <span id="s369">We went away to the woods and we was by Pollacks.</span> <span id="s370">And then we came back to Radun, it's still got left a few.</span> <span id="s371">But we wasn't there, we was afraid to stay there.</span> <span id="s372">And we want to hide, some day by one Pollack, by another, whoever want to keep us, we stay there.</span> <span id="s373">We didn't have nothing, we were suffering very much.</span> <span id="s374">Not to have to eat, not to have where to sleep, so when it was warm, like in the summer time, it was okay.</span> <span id="s375">We was in the woods.</span> <span id="s376">We hide by the Polish people, you know, where they used to keep the horses, the cows, we used to.</span> <span id="s377">They used to not see us, we used to come at night and go away at night, otherwise they wouldn't let us stay, they were afraid, but they used to keep people too, whoever paid them, whoever had a lot of money, you know, like gold.</span> <span id="s378">They used to take only gold.</span> <span id="s379">So one family got killed too, they, the Pollacks killed them.</span> <span id="s380">He thought about this, why you have to keep them and to give them the food and to think maybe the Germans will come and they will kill me, so he killed the whole family, took away everything what they had, the gold, everything.</span> <span id="s381">And he buried them.</span> <span id="s382">This was a family from our town, from Ashoshok (ph), so we was afraid too, to stay by them.</span> <span id="s383">But sometimes we had no choice, we had to, in the winter time, what to do in the winter time?</span> <span id="s384">We had no clothes, we had nothing.</span> <span id="s385">But we used to go, the men used to go to the Polish people wherever we knew them, they used to ask for a coat, something to wear and something to eat, they used to give us to eat, because they was afraid.</span> <span id="s386">They could burn him too, they did for them what they did for the Germans, did to us.</span> <span id="s387">Or what they did to us, they could do this.</span> <span id="s388">What we got to lose?</span> <span id="s389">Our life was ending anyway, every minute, every minute we was thinking, not that we was thinking, we was already to kill.</span> <span id="s390">Like it was, we was hiding by one Pollack and he knew about this, that we are there.</span> <span id="s391">So one day the Germans came there not far away from there, came over to us and he said, "you have to leave right away, in the middle of the day".</span> <span id="s392">If somebody will see us, right away they're going to kill us.</span> <span id="s393">But he said, "you have to leave with no questions".</span> <span id="s394">So we went in the middle of the day, we was going, where to go?</span> <span id="s395">One side the Germans, there the Pollacks, they were going to give us out.</span> <span id="s396">But we had no choice, to go.</span> <span id="s397">We went to the woods, it was not far away.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: Let's stop the tape.</span> <span id="s399">End of Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: We stopped when we went . . . Q: I'll let you continue.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: We went to Radun and we was hiding every day in another place, it was a terrible time.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Nobody wants to keep us.</span> <span id="s404">They were afraid and they didn't want.</span> <span id="s405">We haven't got no money, we haven't got no clothes, we haven't got nothing.</span> <span id="s406">So it was a very bad time, that was that time.</span> <span id="s407">It wasn't so bad with hiding because it was warm.</span> <span id="s408">It was summer time because it was when we went out from Radun was in May, so we had the whole summer, so it wasn't bad, to stay in the woods, to go out then, like at night.</span> <span id="s409">But the most important was the winter, what to do for the winter, where to go, if we were going to be alive.</span> <span id="s410">And sure enough, we decide, somebody told us, "but in Grodno, they called the Third Reich (ph)", that was the Germans called this, there the people are living a normal life, they are in the ghettos, but they are working and they are living in the houses, you know, they have a normal life.</span> <span id="s411">So we thought about this and we decided to go there.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: How far was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: Far away.</span> <span id="s414">Far away from us.</span> <span id="s415">Like I would say from Radun to, I don't know exactly, I'd say like to Washington, maybe, maybe farther away.</span> <span id="s416">But I can't tell you exactly, I don't know.</span> <span id="s417">If my husband, he would tell you exactly.</span> <span id="s418">Well anyway, we decide to go there and so me, my husband, he was a boyfriend that time, with my father, we went to Grodno, with his sister, my husband's sister was with, because her husband was from Grodno.</span> <span id="s419">So he decided, and he said, "we're going to go there", and he had family there.</span> <span id="s420">My sister went with her husband to Lida, it's a bigger town from Radun, they went there and we went there, so we decided like also, it was in fall, fall we went there to Grodno, and we was there and warm from the ghettos.</span> <span id="s421">So we was there, really they had a normal life.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: How did you get there?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: Oh, we walked a lot.</span> <span id="s424">Then we went by, no taxis.</span> <span id="s425">The most by well we went from this town, I don't know.</span> <span id="s426">Oh, we hired a horse with a Pollack, he took us for a short time, to another town what is nearer Grodno, so he took us there.</span> <span id="s427">We came there, we find another one and we walked a lot, and that's how we came to Grodno.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: What was Grodno like?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: What I saw in Grodno, I saw a little town, the ghetto, but it was a big town, it was a very big town, in fact there was two ghettos, in one ghetto they couldn't put all the jews.</span> <span id="s430">So like let's say, in the beginning of the town was a ghetto, and then nearer Tanko (ph), nearer Shull (ph), was the other one.</span> <span id="s431">I never was in it, I was only in this one, in the one ghetto where we came, I was there all the time, with my father and then with mine boyfriend.</span> <span id="s432">He was mostly with his sister, with the family, and we was put in a house also from the family, from their side.</span> <span id="s433">So we was there for two months, I think, if not more a little bit, I can't give you exactly the time, how long we was there.</span> <span id="s434">It was a good time, we had there not bad.</span> <span id="s435">The men, they used to go to work out of the ghetto, and the women, some women used to work for the Germans, but I never went to work there by them, by the Germans.</span> <span id="s436">I was in ghetto, my father was too, he didn't go to work.</span> <span id="s437">My boyfriend, he went, he used to go to work.</span> <span id="s438">And we had food, we had where to sleep, alright we used to sleep on the floor because how many families in one house.</span> <span id="s439">But it wasn't bad, if he wouldn't start to shoot, to take it out.</span> <span id="s440">But there was different already, there was the Jewish people was the, how they called.</span> <span id="s441">Well they used to organize, I mean with the people, to send them out to work, the Jewish people, like the Jewish policemans, they had a name.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: The Huguenots.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: Huguenot, right.</span> <span id="s444">They used to came to the Germans and ask them, we need so many and so many people for work, so they used to send the people.</span> <span id="s445">Then when they start already, the liquidation in the ghetto, they used to come and they used to say, we need for today, 2000 people.</span> <span id="s446">And they used to take them to the gas chambers.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: How did you know that?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: Well we find out.</span> <span id="s449">We knew about this.</span> <span id="s450">So we find places in the ghetto where they used to hide.</span> <span id="s451">They had like bunkers, you know bunker.</span> <span id="s452">So one day before we find out, when my boyfriend went to work, they took like seven or eight people and they didn't come back to the ghetto, they run away.</span> <span id="s453">They run away to go to the woods.</span> <span id="s454">But there was far away from the woods, the Grodno ghetto was far away, it's not like in Ashoshok (ph), so they run away, they didn't come back.</span> <span id="s455">So we knew already that it's time.</span> <span id="s456">So I find out, a bunker, and I went with my father, and some of them, they didn't let us go in because they had plenty people there.</span> <span id="s457">So I said, you must let me.</span> <span id="s458">If I'm going to get killed, you're going to get killed too.</span> <span id="s459">So they had no choice, we was one and another, a bunker, how big it was.</span> <span id="s460">So this was one night, then it was a week later, again, the Huguenot, they came, and they had to give them the people, how many they wanted.</span> <span id="s461">And this was going on for a few weeks.</span> <span id="s462">So one time, we didn't go to the same bunker every day.</span> <span id="s463">One time I find out another place where they hiding, so I said to my father, we're not going to this place, it's like I felt like it's no good to go.</span> <span id="s464">I said, "we're going to another place".</span> <span id="s465">He said to me, "what is the difference, what makes a difference, a bunker is a bunker to hide someplace".</span> <span id="s466">So we went, sure enough, everybody got killed in this bunker.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: Did they get killed by the local population, by the Nazis, do you know?</span> <span id="s468">Who?</span> <span id="s469">A: By the Nazis.</span> <span id="s470">And the local helped them too.</span> <span id="s471">They helped them a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: Were the Nazis inside the ghetto often?</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s474">They used to stay in by the gate, there was a gate all around, you know, where the people had to go to work, and where they had to come back.</span> <span id="s475">So there was one boy, a very nice looking, very nice, beautiful looking boy.</span> <span id="s476">He came from work and they shot him when he had to come in, for no reason at all.</span> <span id="s477">You can talk to nobody, you can ask nobody why.</span> <span id="s478">Why is a crooked letter here, no questions.</span> <span id="s479">They took him, they killed him, that's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: What about the Jewish police, were they good guys or bad guys?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: Well they thought that they were going to be alive, they were going to let them leave.</span> <span id="s482">So whenever they had to take the people, you know, the people used to cry, nobody wants to go.</span> <span id="s483">We knew already that they take them to the gas chambers, not like here, they kill them, you know, right away in the graves.</span> <span id="s484">They took them there.</span> <span id="s485">But they didn't help, they wasn't so good either.</span> <span id="s486">Well they was fighting for their own lives, but they were wrong, they kept them till they need them.</span> <span id="s487">What they don't need they kill, they killed everybody.</span> <span id="s488">So then there came to a point when we was in Grodno, it was one morning, I was still sleeping, and my father went out, he used to get up early in the morning.</span> <span id="s489">He came back, and I heard already the shots, already.</span> <span id="s490">He said to me, "my daughter", he said, "my child, get dressed, they killing already, on the streets, they don't take like, you know, like they used to take, they're killing on the streets".</span> <span id="s491">Get dressed, that's it, this was the last word for him, and when I saw him, I never saw him again.</span> <span id="s492">He went out through the door, that's all.</span> <span id="s493">I got dressed and I went out, and I heard people out screaming, and the shots.</span> <span id="s494">So I figured, where shall I go, where to go?</span> <span id="s495">Before the war, it was a big place like near there, and they used to keep bread, bread and bagels, all kinds of things in a big box, like a very big box, like this, a big box.</span> <span id="s496">So I saw the box and I figured, I'm going to go in there.</span> <span id="s497">I went in without anything, it was cold already, it was winter, fall.</span> <span id="s498">But in Europe comes winter very hard, it's not like here.</span> <span id="s499">And there is fall and winter.</span> <span id="s500">Here is winter, summer, there is no fall.</span> <span id="s501">So I went in without, just in a dress, without anything, and I was sitting there.</span> <span id="s502">I didn't know what to do, my brains didn't work already.</span> <span id="s503">Where was my father, I didn't see him, nobody's there.</span> <span id="s504">I heard all those screams and cry, that's it.</span> <span id="s505">This was in the day time in the morning and this was going until it got a little dark, it got darker, it's came the night.</span> <span id="s506">And it was already quiet, so I figured, everybody got killed.</span> <span id="s507">I was the only one.</span> <span id="s508">What I'm going to do there?</span> <span id="s509">What I'm going to do, without food, without clothes, where to go?</span> <span id="s510">I'm afraid to go in ghetto, I'm afraid to walk, they're going to kill me like everybody they killed.</span> <span id="s511">And it was so quiet, and I don't know where to turn.</span> <span id="s512">The town is not familiar to me, it's not like Ashoshok (ph) or Radun, where I grow up.</span> <span id="s513">It's everything is to me like, I don't know nobody and I don't know where to go.</span> <span id="s514">But then it was start to be already the day time, I was there a whole day and a whole night sitting.</span> <span id="s515">And I heard like somebody's crying, so I figure, I have to get up, go out anyway sometimes, I can't stay here all the time, till I die there?</span> <span id="s516">So I went out and I saw one woman and I said to ask, "from where are you coming"?</span> <span id="s517">She said, everybody got killed, nobody's there.</span> <span id="s518">"What are you doing here"?</span> <span id="s519">"I don't know myself", she said.</span> <span id="s520">I said, "you saw somebody, some Jews"?</span> <span id="s521">She said, "they're in a house, I saw a few people, they're still alive".</span> <span id="s522">I went there and I met the people, I met a few there, a brother and a sister.</span> <span id="s523">I don't remember already, there was a brother and a sister, and another couple.</span> <span id="s524">So I went to them and they said, "When it's going to get dark, very dark at night, we're going to go in", this was still in ghetto, "we're going to go in outside to Livendore (ph), we were going to get dressed.</span> <span id="s525">So I got dressed there, I didn't have nothing, without clothes, without shoes, without anything.</span> <span id="s526">I wore boots I find there, you know, what the people that are not there already, with a coat, with a pocketbook.</span> <span id="s527">And I got dressed and they got dressed and we was waiting till it get dark, and as soon it get dark, we was through the window, going in couples, you know.</span> <span id="s528">To go through the window, to go outside the ghetto, and to reach where to go.</span> <span id="s529">To go out from the ghetto, and to go out from the town.</span> <span id="s530">So as soon, I think I got the third or the fourth, I don't remember exactly, and right away I got caught.</span> <span id="s531">I got caught, he was a policeman working for the Germans, a Pollack, a Polish man.</span> <span id="s532">And he said, "I have to take you to the gestapo".</span> <span id="s533">I said, "why, why you have to take me?</span> <span id="s534">They should kill me, why?</span> <span id="s535">What you going to have from this?</span> <span id="s536">Listen, I don't have nothing, just this what I have on me.</span> <span id="s537">I have the coat and I have the boots, and that's all what I got".</span> <span id="s538">I said, "no money, no clothes, no nothing".</span> <span id="s539">I'm going to leave", I said, "you know what's going on, maybe you did the same thing to them, but what you going to have for this?</span> <span id="s540">If they're going to kill me, you going to have on your mind your whole life because you personally took me there.</span> <span id="s541">When they took all of them, it's different than when you're taking one person.</span> <span id="s542">I am still so young, what can I give you.</span> <span id="s543">If you want I can take off my boots to give you, my coat, and let me go.</span> <span id="s544">Let me live, let me go, think about this".</span> <span id="s545">So I don't know, maybe, and I spoke rather nice Polish, and maybe he realized, I don't know, he had a pity on me, whatever.</span> <span id="s546">I don't know what to say.</span> <span id="s547">And Polish he said to me, " ".</span> <span id="s548">This means, run away.</span> <span id="s549">"Run away , quick, I shouldn't see you".</span> <span id="s550">I start to run but then I figure it's no good to run, people going to think, it's going to be, maybe it's a Jew.</span> <span id="s551">I put on a kerchief, they shouldn't see right away, maybe.</span> <span id="s552">They recognized when I talked, they couldn't recognize that I'm a Jewish girl.</span> <span id="s553">But you can think about this, you know, you never know, and there was very bad people, the Pollacks and the Germans, very bad.</span> <span id="s554">Right away, as soon as they saw a Jewish person, they give to the Germans, to the gestapo.</span> <span id="s555">And I was walking, and I don't know where I'm going, where I'm going, I'm still in the town.</span> <span id="s556">I have to leave the town, it's night time.</span> <span id="s557">So I was going and it start like to snow a little bit, snowing.</span> <span id="s558">So I figured it's snowing, it's dark, maybe they wouldn't recognize me if I stop to talk to them, to ask them.</span> <span id="s559">And I had idea how to go out from the town but I didn't know which way.</span> <span id="s560">So I stopped one Polish woman and I asked her where to go to this place.</span> <span id="s561">She told me and I went there.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">And I went and I was walking a whole night not knowing where to go and where I'm going to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: What happened to the other people who . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: They got killed.</span> <span id="s565">They all got killed, nobody was alive.</span> <span id="s566">I was the only one.</span> <span id="s567">There was, I think three couples, yeah.</span> <span id="s568">I was the only one.</span> <span id="s569">I don't know why and I'll never know.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: Did they get killed right there or were they taken to the gestapo?</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A: I don't know because I can't tell you because I left.</span> <span id="s572">I think not, they didn't got killed right away because I knew for myself because he wanted to take me, he didn't kill me right away.</span> <span id="s573">He wanted to take me to the gestapo.</span> <span id="s574">So I figure that somebody took them too, to the gestapo.</span> <span id="s575">They didn't kill them right away, on the place.</span> <span id="s576">And then I was going and thinking to myself, what to do?</span> <span id="s577">God, where shall I go?</span> <span id="s578">What to do?</span> <span id="s579">If to go to a Pollack, some on the way where I walk, they were going to kill me right away because there was bad people.</span> <span id="s580">I didn't sleep, I was tired.</span> <span id="s581">I was hungry, I wanted to have a little bit water.</span> <span id="s582">Where to go, what to think.</span> <span id="s583">And I was thinking that where I was going, and this time I saw how far away I was, with a slight, because there was snow already, it was winter.</span> <span id="s584">And there was going by the both sides, two people, three people.</span> <span id="s585">So I was thinking, this can't be the Germans, this is all the Pollacks, probably the Pollacks.</span> <span id="s586">But I had no choice, I had to go, I had to walk.</span> <span id="s587">And I see they coming to me, they coming, they coming.</span> <span id="s588">So I took more the kerchief around my head and then they was so near to me, they stopped, and they stopped me.</span> <span id="s589">And they asking me, they couldn't think that this was a Jewish girl, they thought maybe it's a Polish going from one house to the other one, to somebody.</span> <span id="s590">And they said in Polish, they asking me "where are you going"?</span> <span id="s591">So the other man came over and he said to me, called me my name.</span> <span id="s592">"You're alive, you going from Grodno ghetto"?</span> <span id="s593">So I said, "yes".</span> <span id="s594">They was going, they are the partisans, they had a rifle with them, they had two, in fact they had two rifles.</span> <span id="s595">And they were going to Grodno, to ghetto, to take out one person, they was going to take out his mother and the sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: I'll let you begin again.</span> <span id="s597">Do you have a sense of when this was in time?</span> <span id="s598">When this took place when you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: From Grodno ghetto?</span> <span id="s600">When?</span> <span id="s601">This was probably in the beginning of '43, early '43.</span> <span id="s602">Early '43 and it was winter time, that makes sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: I just have one other question before you continue.</span> <span id="s604">You told me that your boyfriend, the last time you saw him he was leaving with a work group to go outside the ghetto.</span> <span id="s605">Did you know his plans?</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: I knew his plans, he told me from before.</span> <span id="s607">That they were planning on running away from work, they were going to go out from ghetto, they were going to go to work, and from there they were going to run away, to go to the partisans, to meet him, but it's a long way they have to go.</span> <span id="s608">"I don't know what you are going to do, try, try".</span> <span id="s609">"How, and when", I said, "I don't know, this we're going to see".</span> <span id="s610">I think that's all.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: Alright, I'll let you continue your story.</span> <span id="s612">Met up with these people who were coming to find their family in Grodno, these partisans, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: If I knew them?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: No, you met up with them?</span> <span id="s615">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: So I'll let you continue.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: They recognized me and then I recognized them because I had my head down, I was afraid to keep up my head and to look at them.</span> <span id="s618">And when they recognized me, then I pick up my head and I saw them, and I recognized them too.</span> <span id="s619">And they ask me where I was going.</span> <span id="s620">They knew that I was in Grodno ghetto.</span> <span id="s621">I said, "I don't know where I'm going, where you are going"?</span> <span id="s622">They said, "we was planning on going to the ghetto and take out my mother, my sister, and other people".</span> <span id="s623">I said, "It's no use to go to the ghetto, nobody's there already, I was probably the last one".</span> <span id="s624">So they figured, and one, a sister with a brother was with me, but they had to, when I went out from the ghetto, there were two in the group with me, but where they are now, I said, "I don't know, they probably went, they took them to the gestapo".</span> <span id="s625">I had luck, I don't know how.</span> <span id="s626">I had this luck, what I'm now alive.</span> <span id="s627">So they recognized and they knew that I'm so tired and hungry.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">End of Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: Well I think when we stopped the tape you were talking about that, you told these people their family wasn't there.</span> <span id="s631">Let me ask you one question before we continue since we had to stop anyway.</span> <span id="s632">To your knowledge, when you said, "nobody was in the ghetto anymore", are you talking about both of the ghettos in Grodno or just your ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: No, I'm talking about this ghetto where I was, I don't know nothing about the other ghetto, nothing at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: Okay, I'll let you continue.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: So when I met the people, and they was going to the Grodno ghetto to take out the family.</span> <span id="s636">So I told them that I was probably the last one, I was with a sister and brother together, with them, and they supposed to go also, to run away because in ghetto, nobody was left around, only a few people, these people what I met, and I was lucky that I met them because otherwise I wouldn't know where to turn and probably I would be killed, some place or in ghetto, whatever.</span> <span id="s637">So I told them what happened with me, with this policeman, what he was working for the gestapo and he wanted to take me.</span> <span id="s638">I told them the whole story and I said, "they let me go", and the rest ones, I said, "they probably not out".</span> <span id="s639">If they would be out from there, if they would be alive, they would be on the same place where I start to walk, on the same way, to walk I mean, on the same way.</span> <span id="s640">But nobody showed up.</span> <span id="s641">And then we heard that the people there, the Pollacks, they was talking, that nobody's in ghetto already, and there is no ghetto.</span> <span id="s642">So we went with Pollack to a house and with them, they took me.</span> <span id="s643">They occupied like the house, they didn't let nobody, they knew that these is partisans, they didn't let nobody to go out, whoever came, a neighbor or somebody, whoever came to the house, they let them in, but they didn't let them out.</span> <span id="s644">They supposed to stay till the night, till we're going to leave, then they can leave.</span> <span id="s645">So the first thing what I had was food because I was hungry, for two days and two nights I didn't eat.</span> <span id="s646">I didn't sleep, and they said, "you got to sleep", and they was staying, you know, all the time watching.</span> <span id="s647">Because if they would let them out, we would be already by the Germans, they would kill us.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: What did they tell these neighbors, they told them you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: Which neighbors?</span> <span id="s650">The neighbor, when they came in, one person came in so he saw already, he knew who we were, that's all.</span> <span id="s651">They said to him, "you sit down or lay down, do whatever you want, but you're not opening up the door and you're not going out, until we're going to leave".</span> <span id="s652">So sure enough, I went to sleep and they were standing the whole day watching if somebody's coming, or the Germans, you never know.</span> <span id="s653">Alright, they didn't have no telephones, they had no communication with them, what to do.</span> <span id="s654">They had to go by themselves, you know, to tell that this and this happened and there is partisans, whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">When it came at night we left from there, we left to go back, they didn't go already to the ghetto because they heard from the Polish people too.</span> <span id="s656">We went to go to the woods, you know, it wasn't so easy to go because on the way was like Germans standing and Pollacks.</span> <span id="s657">It was a separation between Grodno and the other towns.</span> <span id="s658">So they had to go all alone, they knew already, they were partisans, and they knew how to go and they took me, you know, they were walking and I was on the sled with the horse.</span> <span id="s659">We walked a lot too.</span> <span id="s660">And the whole night we was traveling like this, and when it start to be already, we was near the pusha (ph), natcha (ph) pusha (ph), this is the name.</span> <span id="s661">A pusha (ph) means the woods there.</span> <span id="s662">We came there and I met my boyfriend, my husband and I met other people, what I knew them, everybody what I knew, but they weren't in the Grodno ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: Well that must have been a surprise to meet your boyfriend again.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: Well I knew, when I met these people they told me that he's there.</span> <span id="s665">So it started another life, a new life.</span> <span id="s666">So we start there and it was winter time.</span> <span id="s667">They had already a place what they built by themselves, you know, a place for winter because winter time you can't go out, right away you can see that people are walking in the woods and from the woods, and they had to prepare food.</span> <span id="s668">They prepared food and they prepared everything.</span> <span id="s669">And when it came, it was already spring time.</span> <span id="s670">And we heard about, that the Germans, they are planning to look for the partisans in the pusha (ph), so we had to leave.</span> <span id="s671">We had to leave the hiding place, the bunker where we was all winter.</span> <span id="s672">We had to leave this and we went far away from there from this place, but we went to the pusha (ph), to the natcha (ph) pusha (ph) for the where it's more like woods.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: I wanted to ask you a few questions about this.</span> <span id="s674">You were living in this bunker in the woods for many months in the winter.</span> <span id="s675">You stayed inside all the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: Yes, most of the time, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: Stop tape.</span> <span id="s678">I'm just trying to get a sense of what it was like in that bunker, what did you eat, what did people talk about, how did you occupy your minds, what were you thinking?</span> <span id="s679">How did you live?</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: It's hard to explain but in my own words I'll try to explain to you.</span> <span id="s681">Those people where they were before me, they prepared for the winter, food.</span> <span id="s682">They prepared like potatoes, let's say, meat.</span> <span id="s683">It was cold, you know, outside, freezing, snow up to here.</span> <span id="s684">So they prepared food because we couldn't go out, if we would go out, right away you can see the footsteps, you know.</span> <span id="s685">That's why we was afraid to go out for something.</span> <span id="s686">We was living there, whatever we had, it was okay, good, good enough.</span> <span id="s687">As long we can survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: Did you cook in the bunker?</span> <span id="s689">A: Yeah, we cooked.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: How big was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: It was very small, how can I?</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: How many people were in there?</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: It was there, maybe 20 people, ten couples for sure.</span> <span id="s694">Q: Any children?</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: No, no children.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: Did you ever go up for air?</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: At night we used to go out, but not far from the place, say near the place because we was afraid for the footsteps.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: So even the men, everybody stayed inside for most of that time?</span> <span id="s699">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s700">At night we used to go out, to fresh up a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: Go to the bathroom?</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: What kind bathroom?</span> <span id="s703">The woods, we was living in the woods.</span> <span id="s704">Q: What did you talk about, how did you occupy yourselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: We talk about what to do later on.</span> <span id="s706">To go out, to go to the woods or to stay, what to do.</span> <span id="s707">We didn't have to think about what to do, we did it, we have to leave the bunker, but it was already spring time, it was nice.</span> <span id="s708">As soon as we find out that they are planning to search, to look for us, for the partisans, we left the bunker and we went to the woods.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: Did you know whether there were other groups of partisans nearby?</span> <span id="s710">A: There was another group partisans, there was what I told you, the men.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: I need you to start that over, it was too noisy, please.</span> <span id="s712">Were there other partisans nearby?</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s714">This was the other group, without women, only men.</span> <span id="s715">And there was Russian people too.</span> <span id="s716">Russian and our people.</span> <span id="s717">But they knew too, about us.</span> <span id="s718">They had a lot of guns and rifles, those people.</span> <span id="s719">We had too, but very little, you know.</span> <span id="s720">So they went too, there to the pusha (ph), the same thing.</span> <span id="s721">But what they did, the Germans, they had other plans to look over, and then they had like a chain like, you know, a lot of Germans with Pollacks, with Lithuanians, all of them.</span> <span id="s722">And they used to go through the pusha (ph) to find, to look for the people, to look for us.</span> <span id="s723">We had no choice where to go.</span> <span id="s724">We was sitting near, it was woods, a lot, very close one to another.</span> <span id="s725">We was sitting there, me, my husband, my boyfriend that's my husband, my sister, and my brother-in-law.</span> <span id="s726">We were sitting like from one side and from the other side was another group, three people.</span> <span id="s727">Woman with a husband, with a sister.</span> <span id="s728">Three people.</span> <span id="s729">And we heard that the Germans are there, and they killed them, and we were sitting here.</span> <span id="s730">It was like now, I'm talking like an electric storm goes through my body and we was only praying, God help us.</span> <span id="s731">They got killed and they went away.</span> <span id="s732">They figure that no more is in this side, they went, they killed a lot of people that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: How did your sister, how did you reconnect with your sister, how did she get there?</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: Well she came also, she came also from Lida ghetto, have you heard of Lida?</span> <span id="s735">She came there too to the partisan.</span> <span id="s736">Yeah.</span> <span id="s737">You ask me how my sister came?</span> <span id="s738">So she came also from, somebody took her out from the group, from our group, and took her too, there to the partisan and we was together.</span> <span id="s739">So then we picked up ourselves, where to go again, we had no place where to go.</span> <span id="s740">The partisans, they was only the men.</span> <span id="s741">They wouldn't take us.</span> <span id="s742">We went again to the partisan, they had, you know, rifles, they had guns, they had everything and there was a but they didn't want us.</span> <span id="s743">So we went far away, we was going again to the Pollacks, maybe they were going to take us for a day or two or something, you know.</span> <span id="s744">And this was going on for the whole summer, until the winter came.</span> <span id="s745">Then we was thinking what to do, where to go.</span> <span id="s746">We had a Pollack, this was my brother , but he knew him.</span> <span id="s747">We went to him, we went to him and he ask him, he said to him, "listen, you have to do something, let us go in, it's winter time, we have no place where to go".</span> <span id="s748">So it was like, he said, "alright, you can stay by me for a little while, then I'm going to build for you a place in the woods not far from my house and you're going to stay there for winter".</span> <span id="s749">And he was already belonged to the White Pollacks and he was together with them working.</span> <span id="s750">By then they was looking for Jews, to kill them because they wanted, they knew that a lot of Jews survived after the war from the Nazis, but they don't want should be Jews by the Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: When you say, "white Pollacks", are you talking about the Polish home army?</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: No, no, this wasn't an army, this was an organization.</span> <span id="s753">After the war they made the organization, calling themselves White Pollacks.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Q: So it's not the army of .</span></p> <p><span id="s755">A: No, I don't think so.</span> <span id="s756">They wanted a clean Poland.</span> <span id="s757">Poland should be cleaned without Jews, and they looked only for the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s758">So we was by then, I don't remember exactly how long, but we was by him a short time, and one night he came over and he said, "you know what, I feel like you should go out".</span> <span id="s759">This was winter time, we didn't go out, he used to bring us food.</span> <span id="s760">And he used to come, so he came for us and he said, "let's go to my house, I have prepared a dinner for you, for all of you".</span> <span id="s761">We was so happy to go out and to go to a home, to a house.</span> <span id="s762">And really he prepared a dinner for us and we was sitting around the table and we just start to eat and we heard the door got so opened up like this, and they start to shoot.</span> <span id="s763">They start to shoot, we got so scared.</span> <span id="s764">I don't know how many people there were, the Polish people but right away one of us, we was in this bunker by this Pollack, we was six people, other boys.</span> <span id="s765">So one boy probably, he took from him, how was it I don't know because it got dark right away.</span> <span id="s766">When he shoot, he probably shoot both of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Q: Sorry, airplane.</span> <span id="s768">Sorry.</span> <span id="s769">A: I don't know where I left.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: Well you said that they were knocking on the door.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: Yeah, the open the door, I'm getting lost when I start to talk like this.</span> <span id="s772">And they started shooting.</span> <span id="s773">And both of them, probably one boy, I don't remember.</span> <span id="s774">I think we had a gun or something we had in the bunker.</span> <span id="s775">And he shoot somebody, one of the White Pollacks, and he start to be quiet.</span> <span id="s776">It was quiet and nobody was there, they ran away.</span> <span id="s777">They got scared and they ran away.</span> <span id="s778">So my husband and my brother-in-law and the other two, they went away.</span> <span id="s779">So only me with my sister, what to do, we was staying there, we didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s780">So there was the Polish, the Pollacks, they had big stoves, like a oven, a big oven, and under the oven they used to have chickens there to raise them.</span> <span id="s781">So I said to my sister, "let's go there".</span></p> <p><span id="s782">And we went there where the chickens was, and it was so high, and we were staying there until we didn't hear nothing, it was so quiet.</span> <span id="s783">So I said to my sister, "what are we going to do there, let's run".</span> <span id="s784">This was in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s785">It was a frosty night, it was so cold.</span> <span id="s786">I was only in one dress, my sister too.</span> <span id="s787">And I said, "we have to run".</span> <span id="s788">We open up a window and we went out.</span> <span id="s789">We saw, you know, it was a winter night, a frosty night and it was so light, like we saw them from far away.</span> <span id="s790">So I said to my sister, "let's run there, probably this was our people".</span> <span id="s791">We ran away, we met my brother-in-law with my husband and here was the cloth by him, the blood, you know, was egging, like somebody hit him over the head with a rifle, hit him over the head hear and the blood was coming, it was freezing, you know, on him.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">What are we going to do, where were we going to go, who knows that you're going to leave?</span> <span id="s793">Nobody knows, you know, knew about this because he had the open head in the back.</span> <span id="s794">So he said, my husband said, "let's go to this and this Pollack, he's more richer one, maybe he going to let us in for the time being, for the night".</span> <span id="s795">So we went in to him and he saw what the blood is running from him, and we went away from the White Pollacks, he let us in.</span> <span id="s796">He didn't let us in the house, God forbid.</span> <span id="s797">He let us in where the horses are standing with the cows, but we were happy.</span> <span id="s798">We was laying around, you know, my husband, because he was so hurt and the blood was running from him.</span> <span id="s799">The blood got freezed on him.</span> <span id="s800">And take a look, nothing happened to him and nothing happened to us.</span> <span id="s801">As long they didn't kill us, didn't happen, nothing.</span> <span id="s802">We had no sickness, nothing at all.</span> <span id="s803">So it came in the day time and he said, "you know I can't keep you, I would keep you, I'm not sending you now, I know what it is in the daytime, but at night you have to go away".</span> <span id="s804">So where to go?</span> <span id="s805">Alright, food he gave us there in the place.</span> <span id="s806">He gave us an old smock to wear, he sold us.</span> <span id="s807">And we went away to another Pollack, he was living with a sister and with a nephew.</span> <span id="s808">They weren't married, they had no family, only three of them.</span> <span id="s809">We went to them and he saw us and he knew us, he knew my brother-in-law more than us because my brother-in-law, they had a store in Radun and he used to come there.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: We need to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">End of Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Tape #5</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: You were telling me that you had found this Polish person who knew your brother-in-law.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A: Yeah, we went to him, this was already at night.</span> <span id="s815">We went to him and we asked him, we stopped to talk to him and he promised him, he knew him, that he had a store.</span> <span id="s816">That if he had a store, he must have money, he must have clothes, he must have a lot of things.</span> <span id="s817">But he told him, "we have nothing now".</span> <span id="s818">He told us that, "it's near the war, we're going to finish soon".</span> <span id="s819">He said, "let us go into you, take us".</span> <span id="s820">He had like a PD (ph), and he took us there, he took us in.</span> <span id="s821">So he let us in, ion the beginning we was by him also, in the, I don't know how they call, where the horses, where the cows are staying.</span> <span id="s822">So we was there for a short time.</span> <span id="s823">Then he took us and he make us a place upstairs his house, there.</span> <span id="s824">It was like a room, a little room, and we were six people there in the room.</span> <span id="s825">But he gave us food, he was good to us and every day he used to tell us that nobody knew about us, nobody knows, nobody knows nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Q: We're going to have this constantly, how bad is the sound?</span> <span id="s827">You tell me.</span> <span id="s828">So he made your room, he fed you.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: Yeah, and he used to tell us all the time, he used to go to the church and there you listen to the people what they saying, that it's going to be the end of the war, soon, soon it's going to be the end.</span> <span id="s830">He used to come and tell us everything.</span> <span id="s831">And then one day he came and he said, "they saying", we was by him probably two or three months.</span> <span id="s832">He kept us and he feed us everything.</span> <span id="s833">So he came and he said, somebody told him in church that he has Jewish people.</span> <span id="s834">So he came and he told us, he said, "you know what, I kept you all the time, I can't keep you all the time now.</span> <span id="s835">From now on, you have to leave.</span> <span id="s836">Because what is the use if people know already, they find out, so I'm going to get killed, and you're going to get killed.</span> <span id="s837">You better find a place and go away.</span> <span id="s838">Find a place, where is the place?</span> <span id="s839">But thank God it was already spring time.</span> <span id="s840">It was already warm, so we had one way, to go to the woods, and this what we did.</span> <span id="s841">At night time we left him and we went away.</span> <span id="s842">We went away to the woods.</span> <span id="s843">And there already it was May, I think.</span> <span id="s844">In May it was warm already.</span> <span id="s845">Went away in the woods and we was staying there.</span> <span id="s846">At night we used to go out to take for food nearby, you know.</span> <span id="s847">Not nearby but far away.</span> <span id="s848">And there we met other people where they was staying, you know, with families.</span> <span id="s849">So we were happy already, we met other people.</span> <span id="s850">And we used to have, you know, a connection with the Pollacks.</span> <span id="s851">They used to say, they used to talk to us saying that the war is near, near to the end, and this was the end really.</span> <span id="s852">On July the Russian came in and we was free after this.</span> <span id="s853">We was free where to go.</span> <span id="s854">We went to Ashoshok (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Q: Can you describe to me what happened when you say, "the Russians came in".</span></p> <p><span id="s856">A: We was in the woods, came in, the Russian on a horse, on the horses.</span> <span id="s857">We recognized them that they were Russians.</span> <span id="s858">But we were scared, we didn't know who are these.</span> <span id="s859">So they start to talk to us, "we are Russian, you're going to be free now, the war has ended, you come out.</span> <span id="s860">Come out.</span> <span id="s861">Don't be afraid, come out, go home.</span> <span id="s862">Go wherever you want to go, you are free".</span> <span id="s863">That's what he's saying.</span> <span id="s864">But we was in the beginning when we saw them, we recognized them that they are Russians, but still we didn't know, you know.</span> <span id="s865">They fright in us, the scared was in us, we was afraid.</span> <span id="s866">But when they start to talk like this, "go out, don't be afraid, nobody they will do to you something, nobody.</span> <span id="s867">We have freed you, go on, go".</span> <span id="s868">We went and we went right over to Ashoshok to our town, nobody was there, the houses was there.</span> <span id="s869">I went to my house.</span> <span id="s870">There was Pollacks leaving, and I was afraid to go in.</span> <span id="s871">You know, it was a big house, and our big table was standing.</span> <span id="s872">My father was a tailor, he was a heavy man.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">was a wooden floor, and he was standing on one place.</span> <span id="s874">So he was like, how to say to, like dan (ph), it was the woodan (ph), and I saw the place, you know.</span> <span id="s875">I went away from there, and I never wanted to go to my house where I was born and raised and I lost the family.</span> <span id="s876">So we was a few couples.</span> <span id="s877">So we was a few couples, and there was, we find out, Yaffa's (ph) family came.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: Yaffa (ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s879">A: Yaffa (ph) Helia (ph), she was there with the family, with her family, and they was living in their house, in their own house.</span> <span id="s880">So we went to a house nearby, not far away, to my husband's cousin, he had a big house, because I didn't want to go to his house and I didn't want to go to my house.</span> <span id="s881">So we went there, and we was staying there until we, you know, we met the Polish people and they start to talk about everything, what they saw, how all of them got killed, and how they robbed everything, and now they sitting in our houses.</span> <span id="s882">And then we start to think what to do, you know, we have to start to work.</span> <span id="s883">So my husband went to work, he was as a baker.</span> <span id="s884">By then was, they had, his mother used to bake.</span> <span id="s885">So he went to a Pollack to work for him, and he worked for a little.</span> <span id="s886">Then we was living there, we was thinking what to do, where to go, how to establish our lives.</span> <span id="s887">In meantime we heard that the White Pollacks, they are coming to our town.</span> <span id="s888">So my husband and the other couple said, "what they going to do, what?</span> <span id="s889">It's after the war, what they going to do"?</span> <span id="s890">So I said, "they are coming, they said the White Pollacks are coming, they're going to kill us".</span> <span id="s891">And sure enough.</span> <span id="s892">So before this night, this has to happen before the , I said to my husband, "I'm going there to Yaffialia (ph), to this family, I'm afraid to stay there, after all there is a family and he knows where are the people".</span> <span id="s893">But I went with another of the couples, what we are staying together with another person.</span> <span id="s894">We went there, we came to them, to this family.</span> <span id="s895">And we was waiting, they are coming or not?</span> <span id="s896">We wasn't sure, but the Pollacks, they said that they are going to come.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">And sure enough, they came.</span> <span id="s898">It was at night time and they came and they open up like this, the door, and they came in and I heard, and we was on the second floor.</span> <span id="s899">There was a house, a two-family house.</span> <span id="s900">It's not really a two family, but they had bedrooms upstairs, and downstairs they had a kitchen, they had everything, you know, in the house.</span> <span id="s901">"We heard", I said to the other person, Esther, "you heard, I heard the shotting there", and sure enough, they shot her mother, the baby she had on her hands, and they shot them.</span> <span id="s902">So I said to her, "they're going to shot us too".</span> <span id="s903">I opened up the door and I jumped from the second floor and I said, "it's no use to stay there because they're going to kill us, and we're going to run away, we have a choice".</span> <span id="s904">And sure enough, we run away.</span> <span id="s905">I said, "so I'm going to break a leg, I'm going to break something, but I'm going to be alive still".</span> <span id="s906">But they didn't come upstairs.</span> <span id="s907">We ran away.</span> <span id="s908">They killed the mother with the baby and they went away.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">Q: Now I need to ask you a few questions about this.</span> <span id="s910">Do you remember when this was?</span> <span id="s911">A: This was October, 1944, October the 20th, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">Q: How did you know that Yaffa's (ph) mother and baby brother were killed, how die you know that's who it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A: After, after we find out.</span> <span id="s914">How do I know, I run away, I didn't know nothing.</span> <span id="s915">I thought that they going to, they killed everybody, the whole family.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">Q: So you heard the noise and you heard shouting, and you heard shots?</span> <span id="s917">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">Q: Could you understand, and these were Polish, could you understand what they were saying, did you hear them talking?</span></p> <p><span id="s919">A: No, I didn't hear them talking.</span> <span id="s920">First of all, we was on second floor, I couldn't hear talking them.</span> <span id="s921">But we ran away, I ran, I don't know.</span> <span id="s922">I don't know where really.</span> <span id="s923">But I heard already that it's quiet.</span> <span id="s924">I went home, there to my husband, and he find out already, he came there to the house to find out, because I was there, that they killed the mother and the baby.</span> <span id="s925">And this was, that's all, this was the end.</span> <span id="s926">After the war, after getting through so much in their lifes, and she had the baby there in a bunker, maybe you know about this?</span> <span id="s927">No, she didn't tell you Yaffialia (ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s928">A: You tell me.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q: Yes, she had the baby there, and they came with the baby, and they had to start a new life, and to live.</span> <span id="s930">And take a look what happened.</span> <span id="s931">They killed them and the father got crazy.</span> <span id="s932">He went crazy.</span> <span id="s933">From there on we start to look where to go again.</span> <span id="s934">I went to my sister in Radun, and then we didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s935">We said, "maybe we'll go".</span> <span id="s936">We went back to Ashoshok (ph), we was there for a little while, then we went to Vilna.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: I need to ask you this, is there anything else that you can remember or you can tell me about, any more details about that night at Yaffa's (ph) house, when the Polish people came in, how did you know that they were Polish.</span> <span id="s938">Do you have any sense of how many of them there were.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">A: What do you mean, "how do I know are they Polish"?</span> <span id="s940">Who could come to kill, who could come in the middle of the night to kill people?</span> <span id="s941">Only the White Pollacks.</span> <span id="s942">We knew already, somebody from the Pollacks told us, they are planning to come to kill us.</span> <span id="s943">We didn't think about this, why they should come to kill us, why, what for?</span> <span id="s944">They took away everything already from us, we didn't have nothing, why they should kill us?</span> <span id="s945">You see, if we would take, we believed them, the Pollacks what they was saying, we would run away, naturally.</span> <span id="s946">But we couldn't believe them, why they should do this?</span> <span id="s947">We didn't take nothing from them, why they should do this?</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: So some of the people in your town were nice to you and they warned you, but there was this other group who wanted to get rid of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: Yeah, and just some little people, what they were nice.</span> <span id="s950">But the most, the most were bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">They took our houses right away, they took everything, whatever have got left.</span> <span id="s952">You know, living there for generations, for generations.</span> <span id="s953">I had a grandfather, a grandmother, a mother.</span> <span id="s954">You know, so there must be something, they had something.</span> <span id="s955">So how can be, how can they be nice to us, and be polite to us, and help us, they didn't want us.</span> <span id="s956">So these few people, what they've got left, they wanted to kill too, and they killed.</span> <span id="s957">And you heard what had happened in Kent, so that happened there too, and they killed a lot of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">Q: Did you see any of these people?</span> <span id="s959">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: You just heard them, and you heard the shouting.</span> <span id="s961">A: That's all.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: So you decided to go to Vilna.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">A: So we went there and we tried to find work, it was very hard to.</span> <span id="s964">It was Russian people, and Lithuania.</span> <span id="s965">We didn't know the language, not none of them.</span> <span id="s966">But we tried, you know.</span> <span id="s967">My husband went to work, he was a tailor, so he find work.</span> <span id="s968">And I went to work as a waiter, but I didn't know the language.</span> <span id="s969">I used to, they used to come to order, a order, I used to write in Polish.</span> <span id="s970">But the sentence that came out, Polish words but they came out in Russian, you understand?</span> <span id="s971">I used to go in the kitchen to order the food, and this way I start to learn the language.</span> <span id="s972">I used to come home and read and, you know, I tried the best only through.</span> <span id="s973">And in the beginning it was very hard but they liked me there, and I learned.</span> <span id="s974">And then I worked as a, later on already I worked as a, what do you say, as I gave orders already.</span> <span id="s975">You know, and I learned the language and I start to work, and it wasn't so bad, I had good.</span> <span id="s976">And I got pregnant, in 1950 I gave birth to my daughter and I had in the house always there, you know, a woman.</span> <span id="s977">Until they start to talk to go away from Russia.</span> <span id="s978">You know, it was a hard life, but in Lithuania it was easier, the life.</span> <span id="s979">They start to take out people, you know, where they used to work, where they had, where they was reached.</span> <span id="s980">But they come out to bring them on the Siberia, you know.</span> <span id="s981">This was a killing too, on the Siberia.</span> <span id="s982">Till they opened up with the Polish, they wanted all the Polish people what they've got left, they want them in Poland.</span> <span id="s983">And the Russian, they let them out, so right away, soon it was this, you know.</span> <span id="s984">But then in the papers, on the radio I heard this.</span> <span id="s985">So right away, I said to my husband, "we have to leave, there's no future in here".</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Q: Were the Lithuanian people nice to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s987">A: I don't know really, not bad.</span> <span id="s988">I worked with a Lithuanian, one person, a few of them.</span> <span id="s989">They wasn't so bad, no I wouldn't say.</span></p> <p><span id="s990">Q: And was there any threat that you or your husband would have to go to Siberia?</span></p> <p><span id="s991">A: That could be.</span> <span id="s992">Could be, they can find all the time, any time.</span> <span id="s993">And this was why we were afraid.</span> <span id="s994">That's why we wanted to get out of there.</span> <span id="s995">But usually we was, it wasn't so bad to live there.</span> <span id="s996">I was working, my husband worked.</span> <span id="s997">We made a lot, I didn't have to stand in line for bread, for other things.</span> <span id="s998">I used to get easy where I worked, you know.</span> <span id="s999">So it wasn't so hard.</span> <span id="s1000">So it wasn't so bad.</span> <span id="s1001">This was the only thing what I was afraid, they shouldn't send us to Siberia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q: Now were you working in a place where there were a lot of Russian officials?</span> <span id="s1003">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">Q: So you got to know them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">A: The director, he was a Jew too, but they didn't speak no Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1006">He understood, he knew what I went through and a lot of things I learned from him.</span> <span id="s1007">He was very nice, in fact when I left, I came and I said to him, "I have to leave, I'm going away, I'm going to Poland".</span> <span id="s1008">I didn't say that I'm going to Israel, I want to go to America.</span> <span id="s1009">This I couldn't mention, God forbid.</span> <span id="s1010">So I said, "I'm going away, there is, got left from the war, from the family".</span> <span id="s1011">I have to go there.</span> <span id="s1012">He used to say to me, "why?</span> <span id="s1013">Take a look you have a good position, you're working, you have everything, whatever you need, why you should go away?</span> <span id="s1014">Why"?</span> <span id="s1015">All the time.</span> <span id="s1016">"You're never going to find a life like this".</span> <span id="s1017">Sure, I'm never going to find a life like this.</span> <span id="s1018">To live, to go to sleep and to think that maybe somebody knocks on door to take us out and to take us to Siberia.</span> <span id="s1019">For no reason at all.</span> <span id="s1020">And if I worked, I was afraid at work too.</span> <span id="s1021">They could put you in jail for a little nothing.</span> <span id="s1022">For the littlest nothing.</span> <span id="s1023">Maybe somebody could say one word on you, that's it.</span> <span id="s1024">This would be enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">Q: Even though you had this good relationship?</span> <span id="s1026">A: Doesn't matter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">Q: And yet you were going to go to Poland, the Poles had been very bad to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">A: Yeah, I'm going to go into Poland just to go through to Poland, not to stay there, not to live there.</span> <span id="s1029">I was in Poland, in Russia, for two months I think, then I left for Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">Q: How did you arrange this, did someone help you?</span> <span id="s1031">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">Q: To get to Warsaw to get to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s1034">There was first of all, to Russia to go because we was born and raised, so we could go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">They let us go.</span> <span id="s1036">Understand, we was born, and we had to go to Moscow to take out some papers.</span> <span id="s1037">But we are, we are really Polish people, we was born there and raised there, so they let us go, the Russians.</span> <span id="s1038">And we think in Poland, we could stay there, they didn't throw us out.</span> <span id="s1039">They gave us food too.</span> <span id="s1040">They was very nice there, but we was afraid to stay there.</span> <span id="s1041">And we was trying to go away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">Q: Who gave you food there?</span> <span id="s1043">A: The government.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">Q: Polish government?</span> <span id="s1045">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">Q: As displaced people, they just helped you?</span> <span id="s1047">A: Yeah, they helped us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">Q: Did they give you an apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">A: We was in a hotel, staying in a hotel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">Q: And the Polish government took care of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1052">They helped us, they helped us.</span> <span id="s1053">That time was very nice, pleasant.</span> <span id="s1054">It was a very nice guy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">Q: I'm sorry, I want to ask you, when you got to Warsaw, did you meet people there or maybe in Vilna who would come out of the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1057">Yes, a lot of them.</span> <span id="s1058">Q: Was that shocking to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">A: It wasn't shocking, why was shocking?</span> <span id="s1060">Q: You knew what had happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s1062">I was in contact with my, when I was in Vilna, my sister left earlier and she was already in America, United States.</span> <span id="s1063">She was writing to me letters but not through the house, I was afraid.</span> <span id="s1064">They could take me to Siberia because I have . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">Q: Is that a dog?</span> <span id="s1066">[tape cuts off] End of tape #5</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">Tape #6</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">A: We had a cats.</span> <span id="s1069">They used to eat together with us, they used to sleep together.</span> <span id="s1070">The cats with a dog used to sleep together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">Q: Jason?</span> <span id="s1072">It's on the next door porch.</span> <span id="s1073">Can we drug him?</span> <span id="s1074">What's he barking at?</span> <span id="s1075">Okay.</span> <span id="s1076">You left off, you said your sister was beginning to write you letters.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">A: I couldn't have the letters by me, so she used to write in the postal center, they used to call, if you're familiar with this.</span> <span id="s1078">So I used to come in the post office and I used to take out a letter.</span> <span id="s1079">I was afraid to read there in the building, I used to go around where I didn't see people.</span> <span id="s1080">And I used to read and cry a lot.</span> <span id="s1081">And I used to tear it in little, little pieces, that's all.</span> <span id="s1082">And I couldn't answer her, I was afraid because they can come at night and take me out, that's all, take away.</span> <span id="s1083">You know, before Stalin died, he had a plan to take out all the Jews, to take them to Siberia and to freeze them there.</span> <span id="s1084">Not to kill them like the Germans did, but he would freeze them.</span> <span id="s1085">Because there it's so cold that you can't go out.</span> <span id="s1086">And he would keep us in a place like this where there's no eat, no nothing, and he would kill all the Jews.</span> <span id="s1087">So I was all the time, you know, my daughter was born in 1950 and this was in 1953 before he died.</span> <span id="s1088">So he had this plan and they had to start already.</span> <span id="s1089">And we didn't know what to do, again.</span> <span id="s1090">It was worse, but like this we had a good life, but we had no future and we was afraid for tomorrow.</span> <span id="s1091">So when he died he didn't have too much time because he died in 1953 and there was, then was other people took over and the other people was very good, very good to everybody, and we had a good life.</span> <span id="s1092">Till then I start to write letters to my sister, and she start to write to me, to answer me.</span> <span id="s1093">But to go out it was out of the question, we couldn't go out never, never in life.</span> <span id="s1094">But then when they changed, when came the other people in Stalin's place, so they letted out the Polish people to go to Poland.</span> <span id="s1095">This way we went to Poland.</span> <span id="s1096">And from Poland I wrote already my sister, she knew already that I'm there.</span> <span id="s1097">I called her, I made a call on her telephone, you know, she should pay.</span> <span id="s1098">And then she start to take us from Poland to America, to United States.</span> <span id="s1099">But after a little while she find out that she can't take us all, it has to be one person and this is going to take a long, long time until we're going to get the visa.</span> <span id="s1100">So I said to her, and that time they said, "whoever wants to go to Israel can go free".</span> <span id="s1101">So I said to my husband, "whether it's going plane or it's going a ship, we are going, we are not staying here in Poland with the Polish people".</span> <span id="s1102">And this what we did.</span> <span id="s1103">So I didn't wait for my sister till she was going to do everything.</span> <span id="s1104">We went to Israel, at least I'm safe there, I have got a life.</span> <span id="s1105">It was a hard time.</span> <span id="s1106">It was after a war, we had seen, it was a war, it was very hard.</span> <span id="s1107">Everything was like you had to get, like for food, you know.</span> <span id="s1108">It was hard to get to work, everything was hard.</span> <span id="s1109">Anyway my sister helped me, she send me money, she send me packages, and she helped me a lot.</span> <span id="s1110">Till she's this was in '57 when we came to Israel, 1957.</span> <span id="s1111">So it was till 1959, till my sister made out the papers for us, for all of us.</span> <span id="s1112">In the beginning she could only take one person, me with my daughter or my husband.</span> <span id="s1113">I didn't want to leave my husband.</span> <span id="s1114">Or he didn't want to leave me.</span> <span id="s1115">So I said to her, I was that we're not going to leave.</span> <span id="s1116">If to go, to come to you, only all of us.</span> <span id="s1117">Otherwise we're going to stay in Israel.</span> <span id="s1118">Now is a bad time but we're going to get through this.</span> <span id="s1119">We had hard times a lot in our lives, we get through this too.</span> <span id="s1120">But the only thing, that we are free, we are with Jews, I'm not afraid that they're going to kill me, that I'm a Jew.</span> <span id="s1121">Everybody's there, the Jews, but the Arabs, nobody was afraid for the Arabs there, that time.</span> <span id="s1122">Even now, they're not afraid for them.</span> <span id="s1123">Whatever's going to happen's going to happen.</span> <span id="s1124">But it's our land, it's our place, it's our home.</span> <span id="s1125">And the biggest mistake what I did in my life is when I came here to this country.</span> <span id="s1126">Maybe God punished me for this.</span> <span id="s1127">What I went through here, a lot of trouble.</span> <span id="s1128">And there maybe I would avoid everything and wouldn't come to me so much trouble as it came here.</span> <span id="s1129">I left because I wasn't afraid that it was a hard time.</span> <span id="s1130">My husband went to work, and he work, he could work.</span> <span id="s1131">He went, he never had this, he never worked on this work what he went on, construction.</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">Anything.</span> <span id="s1133">We went there to the people, they're called Sokinote (ph), where they're giving specialty places, you know, office where they're giving fair to work.</span> <span id="s1134">So they said, on person was sitting, like a heavy man, he said, "I have all of this work, I can't give you no other one, I don't have it".</span> <span id="s1135">So this is the only thing, my husband took the work and the only thing what I said to him, I said, "how many times we have to get through everything, to start from the beginning".</span> <span id="s1136">And that's what start.</span> <span id="s1137">We had our home, like they gave us, the government, we had to pay a certain amount money, and they build specially homes for the new come in, and we had already established.</span> <span id="s1138">I had two bedrooms, and I was so happy, and I was planning to go to work because I couldn't, then my daughter went to school and I was planning to go to work.</span> <span id="s1139">I could work in these places, you know, as a waiter, I knew already the work.</span> <span id="s1140">And the language, it wasn't for me like it was here, I knew a little bit but I forgot, you know, when I was a child I was.</span> <span id="s1141">But my daughter went to school and she start to talk right away in Hebrew, in fact she went to the second grade, and they were happy and I was happy with them.</span> <span id="s1142">Then all of a sudden came the visa with my sister.</span> <span id="s1143">I was so unhappy to leave.</span> <span id="s1144">I left only because I had my sister here, otherwise I would never, never in my life.</span> <span id="s1145">Here start again, you know.</span> <span id="s1146">All those with hard times, with everything.</span> <span id="s1147">Alright, I came to my sister and I had by her, I was by her for 11 months, not quite a whole year.</span> <span id="s1148">I gave birth to my son, and was blessed by her in the house, you know, in 1959.</span> <span id="s1149">And I wasn't happy, I was unhappy.</span> <span id="s1150">I didn't have my place.</span> <span id="s1151">When I start to look for my own place, for apartment, where I used to go, nobody wants me.</span> <span id="s1152">With two children nobody wants.</span> <span id="s1153">Nobody wants me.</span> <span id="s1154">Till I find an apartment, and my sister used to say, "why you want to go out"?</span> <span id="s1155">It was no good, she was our family.</span> <span id="s1156">Like, she had one child only.</span> <span id="s1157">She had a brand new house, just bought it.</span> <span id="s1158">When I came, she just moved in.</span> <span id="s1159">And I didn't feel like to stay there, you know, with a baby.</span> <span id="s1160">So I used to go to find an apartment.</span> <span id="s1161">One day I went and I find apartment there, it wasn't so nice apartment.</span> <span id="s1162">From there she moved out, she left me her apartment, when I'm going to come?</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">And she paid for a month rent, that time it was $50 rent, you know, in 1959.</span> <span id="s1164">So I came and I was pregnant, and this was on the third floor or on the fourth floor, I don't remember.</span> <span id="s1165">And I went there, you know, with my big belly and I saw and there was already Shlowtsy (ph), you know, the blanket people around.</span> <span id="s1166">And as soon I came out.</span> <span id="s1167">So my sister said, she saw already I mean, I started crying.</span> <span id="s1168">I said, "I left a beautiful home, my beautiful house and I was so happy there, why I came here, to climb on the fourth floor"?</span> <span id="s1169">I said, "with a, is going to be born a little baby"?</span> <span id="s1170">So she said, "you don't have to take, you don't have to, you have a place.</span> <span id="s1171">We're going to find another place, don't worry".</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">Q: This was in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">A: So then I was looking and looking.</span> <span id="s1174">Finally I find a place where they let me in, and I said to my sister, she didn't know about this place and I gave the deposits right away.</span> <span id="s1175">She went away and took our deposits, she didn't like the apartment.</span> <span id="s1176">I had to put in money there, it wasn't so nice, she didn't like it.</span> <span id="s1177">So then we start to look around her.</span> <span id="s1178">And I find apartment, this was a walk-in apartment.</span> <span id="s1179">In the beginning she didn't want it also, my sister.</span> <span id="s1180">But she said, "alright, this one is more like it, okay, you're near me and you'll be with the children, whatever".</span> <span id="s1181">She took my daughter to school, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">Q: Stop?</span> <span id="s1183">Not yet.</span> <span id="s1184">"You stopped", you said, "your sister helped you", she took your daughter to school, and you started getting adjusted or it was tough?</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">A: Well I was with a little baby.</span> <span id="s1186">I couldn't go to work, I couldn't help my husband.</span> <span id="s1187">He was working for three years day and night, you know, to, he saw that nobody wants us in apartment, we have to buy something for ourselves.</span> <span id="s1188">So it was a hard time, I can't say it was light.</span> <span id="s1189">But thank God, I find an apartment by older people, in a walk-in.</span> <span id="s1190">They let me in with the two children, and that time I didn't have no television, no nothing.</span> <span id="s1191">You know, my sister gave me a bed and she gave me, you know, I didn't have nothing.</span> <span id="s1192">Like a table, chairs, to eat, on what to eat.</span> <span id="s1193">Well she gave me a lot of stuff so I had, then little by little I bought it for myself.</span> <span id="s1194">I buyed one piece here or one piece there.</span> <span id="s1195">And I was there for four years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">Q: What were some of the biggest difficulties when you came to this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">A: The difficult was, without a language, without money, without everything.</span> <span id="s1198">We had nobody, only my sister.</span> <span id="s1199">This was the only help, what I had from my sister.</span> <span id="s1200">Otherwise, my daughter used to come from school, she used to make the homework, and she used to cry, and I was crying with her.</span> <span id="s1201">"Why you came here, why you came here, what made you to come here?</span> <span id="s1202">You don't live with your sister anyway in one house, why you came here?</span> <span id="s1203">We had already everything there, and there was all the Jews.</span> <span id="s1204">Why you came here, to put me again with other people, I mean non Jews".</span> <span id="s1205">All aggressions it was all the time, for the longest time I remember.</span> <span id="s1206">And I used to curse myself what I did, but there was no way to go back.</span> <span id="s1207">We had to do it.</span> <span id="s1208">I said to my husband, "we start and we have to finish, and we have to raise the children, and we have to go on with our lives.</span> <span id="s1209">Otherwise what it's going to be"?</span> <span id="s1210">Then I went when he was already three years old.</span> <span id="s1211">My daughter used to come from school at 3:00, I used to go at 4:00 at work.</span> <span id="s1212">I used to work in a factory for chuckalud (ph), the second shift.</span> <span id="s1213">So I used to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">Q: So it was a tough adjustment being here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">A: Very hard, very hard.</span> <span id="s1216">To start from the beginning, how many times you can start?</span> <span id="s1217">How many times?</span> <span id="s1218">I was 37 years old when I came here and I gave birth to my son.</span> <span id="s1219">It's a good remembering, you know, my whole life.</span> <span id="s1220">He was born in March and I came in February, just in the same day.</span> <span id="s1221">I came February the sixth, March the sixth he was born.</span> <span id="s1222">This time to get to, to be in hospital for a whole week and talk to the walls.</span> <span id="s1223">This was good?</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">Q: What do you think gave you the strength to get through all of this?</span> <span id="s1225">Is there something in your character that helped you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">A: Well I have a very hard character.</span> <span id="s1227">And really, I'm not afraid, I'm on?</span> <span id="s1228">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">A: I'm not afraid for anything.</span> <span id="s1230">Shut it off a little.</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">Q: You want to turn it off.</span> <span id="s1232">So you had a tough constitution.</span> <span id="s1233">A: Yeah, very.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">Q: Do you think that's something you learned through your, when you were a child, or it's just the way you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">A: I don't think so, when I was a child it was nothing specially.</span> <span id="s1236">We was growing up, till I was, but I don't think I didn't went through nothing specially like.</span> <span id="s1237">I remember when my grandfather died, this I remember.</span> <span id="s1238">I was staying with him.</span> <span id="s1239">He had a stroke.</span> <span id="s1240">Nobody knew what it was.</span> <span id="s1241">When he was sick, I used to come and gave him water, you know, but the mouth was on the side.</span> <span id="s1242">To this day, what I remember when I was a child.</span> <span id="s1243">Otherwise, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">Q: Maybe your parents respected you independence?</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">A: When my sister went to school.</span> <span id="s1246">In Europe they used to start when you were seven years old.</span> <span id="s1247">I was not quite six years, I was five and three quarters, something like this.</span> <span id="s1248">So I said, I start to cry when she went to school.</span> <span id="s1249">So I said to my mother, "I want to go to school too".</span> <span id="s1250">So I remember, my mother said, "let her go, let her go.</span> <span id="s1251">She'll be able to go, to make homework, let her go".</span> <span id="s1252">I was crying, and I wanted to go, and I went.</span> <span id="s1253">And I went and I was staying at school with her, with my sister, and we was together all the years through the school.</span> <span id="s1254">In fact, when we was in the fifth grade, my sister got sick and she couldn't go to school no more, and I went and I finished seven classes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">Q: So you were a willful child?</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">A: I wasn't so bad.</span> <span id="s1257">I wasn't too, I mean I didn't gave her a hard time, my parents like naughty children giving hard times.</span> <span id="s1258">I never heard of this and I raise like this, my children.</span> <span id="s1259">They never said to me, "no", or "I want to do this and I'm going to do it".</span> <span id="s1260">And I used to say, "no way".</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">Q: Let me ask you something.</span> <span id="s1262">During these years, during the Holocaust, did religion play any role in keeping you strong, or did you even know when it was Shabbos (ph)?</span> <span id="s1263">Or did you pay any attention to this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">A: We do pay attention, we do.</span> <span id="s1265">We used to pray and ask God, he should help us.</span> <span id="s1266">But then, what we could do?</span> <span id="s1267">Nothing to do.</span> <span id="s1268">Why God punish us?</span> <span id="s1269">Why is God on their place, on the non Jews place, on the non Jews side, not on our side.</span> <span id="s1270">What we did wrong?</span> <span id="s1271">We kept strictly, there was nothing non kosher, I didn't heard this after the war.</span> <span id="s1272">But before the war, where I was raised in a house, I never heard of this non kosher things, or to do something on Saturdays.</span> <span id="s1273">We never heard of this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">Q: But during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">A: During the war was a different thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">Q: Did you know when holidays were?</span> <span id="s1277">Did you even know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">A: We knew a little, like Yom Kippur, you know, Yom Kippur, you're not allowed to eat.</span> <span id="s1279">So we was counting, that it has to be this time, let's say tomorrow.</span> <span id="s1280">And we had this week before, we had a mistake.</span> <span id="s1281">So twice we didn't eat, we prayed but we didn't have no books to pray.</span> <span id="s1282">But what is the holidays, what is this?</span> <span id="s1283">What is everything there, where was our God?</span> <span id="s1284">Where was our God?</span> <span id="s1285">To listen to little babies crying, to be taking away mothers, I mean kids, babies from mothers.</span> <span id="s1286">You have to give away your baby to kill them?</span> <span id="s1287">It's not heard.</span> <span id="s1288">It was in Spain Inquisition, you heard about this?</span> <span id="s1289">I suppose you learn about this.</span> <span id="s1290">But years and years ago, maybe 2000 years ago, so they killed people because they are Jews.</span> <span id="s1291">They had a choice, they could get to be non Jews if they wanted to leave.</span> <span id="s1292">But they didn't want it.</span> <span id="s1293">So they burned them, you know about this.</span> <span id="s1294">But we didn't have no choices, we are a Jew, you are a Jew, you have to be killed, that's it.</span> <span id="s1295">No pity from nobody, from nobody.</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">Q: Were you angry you were a Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">A: Sometimes, sometimes.</span> <span id="s1298">You know, some girls, I had a friend, Pollack took her, and he raised her.</span> <span id="s1299">She wasn't the same age as I am, as I was.</span> <span id="s1300">He kept her the whole war.</span> <span id="s1301">She used to go to church, she used to pray there.</span> <span id="s1302">She used to do things whatever he said, whatever he told her.</span> <span id="s1303">And she was as a Polish girl.</span> <span id="s1304">After the war, she came in Ashoshok (ph), to our town, with this man.</span> <span id="s1305">He was a older man already, and she went back to him.</span> <span id="s1306">That time soldiers came in our town, came a soldier, a young boy.</span> <span id="s1307">And somebody told him that in this and this, down there lives a Yiddish, Jewish girl.</span> <span id="s1308">She lives by Pollack and she is a Pollack, she goes to church and everything.</span> <span id="s1309">Even there, he took her out.</span> <span id="s1310">He took her out, he got married to her, and he took her to Israel.</span> <span id="s1311">I went there, I went there by her.</span> <span id="s1312">If not for him, she would be, she would spend her whole life there with him.</span> <span id="s1313">Well he gave her life, let's put it this way, he gave her life.</span> <span id="s1314">A lot of people they got married to the Pollacks and they was staying with them.</span> <span id="s1315">But I don't know if I would do this, I don't think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">Q: How long after liberation did it take you to start being observant again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">A: A long, long time.</span> <span id="s1318">We couldn't come to ourself.</span> <span id="s1319">First of all, you know, as a young girl I was so skinny, I didn't have no bust, no nothing.</span> <span id="s1320">When we came I had worn, I don't know, I didn't have no underwear, no nothing.</span> <span id="s1321">And excuse me, I got sick.</span> <span id="s1322">I used to sleep and the water goes.</span> <span id="s1323">It was hard till I got to myself.</span> <span id="s1324">I got to eat food better and I realized that it can't be this time, it can't come back any more.</span> <span id="s1325">And I have to establish my life, and I have to lie, you know.</span> <span id="s1326">So why from them?</span> <span id="s1327">And that's what it is.</span> <span id="s1328">I mean, I looked out for myself and I used to say, "we have to do it, we have to have a family, we have to have a life".</span> <span id="s1329">I don't know who tried, maybe my parents, who knows.</span> <span id="s1330">Because to be honest with you, I couldn't believe in God already, what he did to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">Q: Okay, I'm going to put in one more tape.</span> <span id="s1332">End of Tape #6</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">Tape #7</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">Q: Is religion important to you today?</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">A: It is important because I want the children, they should go in the same footsteps.</span> <span id="s1336">Otherwise, I'll be honest with you.</span> <span id="s1337">If not for the children, maybe I would be a free person.</span> <span id="s1338">I'm going every Saturday to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s1339">My husband goes twice a day now, since he retired.</span> <span id="s1340">But before he used to go also only on Saturdays.</span> <span id="s1341">He used to work on Saturdays because we had to make a living.</span> <span id="s1342">Nobody wants them, they want Saturdays too.</span> <span id="s1343">And this what we went through, I wouldn't care too much.</span> <span id="s1344">But later on when the kids start to go to school, I wanted them, I used to light candles every Friday night.</span> <span id="s1345">I didn't cook on Shabbos (ph), on Saturdays.</span> <span id="s1346">I used to prepare Fridays.</span> <span id="s1347">When I used to go to work I used to stay till 2:00 at night on Thursday night to prepare for the two days food, not to cook, not to do anything.</span> <span id="s1348">And I used to clean and shop, everything in the same day.</span> <span id="s1349">Used to come from work, go shopping, to prepare and cook.</span> <span id="s1350">That was the life.</span> <span id="s1351">Then I wanted my daughter should go to Ishiri (ph), they wanted a lot of money.</span> <span id="s1352">Yaffialia (ph) tried for me, I couldn't do it.</span> <span id="s1353">So I gave her public school, she went to public school.</span> <span id="s1354">Then when my son was already five years old, I put him in Ishiri (ph), I find more or less cheaper.</span> <span id="s1355">I put him in Ishiri (ph), he didn't, he was so connected to me like a wire.</span> <span id="s1356">And I was staying with him, for a whole month I used to go to Ishiri (ph) with him and sitting with him.</span> <span id="s1357">Till the rabbi came to me and he said, "it's no use, he's crying, he doesn't want, he doesn't like.</span> <span id="s1358">Take him home, take and put him some place else".</span> <span id="s1359">What I did the mistake is, when I gave him to Ishiri (ph), it was only boys, it was too religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">Q: You felt it was important to keep up the traditions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1362">And now I'm keeping up very strongly, very.</span> <span id="s1363">I don't write on Shabbos (ph), on holidays.</span> <span id="s1364">Q: Over the years, especially maybe when your children were a bit younger than they are now, did you talk about your experiences during the Holocaust?</span> <span id="s1365">Did you tell them about them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">Q: Now do they know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">A: They know, some things.</span> <span id="s1369">Little things I told them.</span> <span id="s1370">But I couldn't sit with them and talk about this.</span> <span id="s1371">I would hurt myself too much.</span> <span id="s1372">So I didn't talk to them, really.</span> <span id="s1373">They find out from places, from movies, from books, from these things.</span> <span id="s1374">From papers they find out.</span> <span id="s1375">Then little things I told them where I was, like from Ashoshok (ph), like from Grodno, little things.</span> <span id="s1376">When I was in the woods.</span> <span id="s1377">So my grandson used to listen to, he wanted I should tell him.</span> <span id="s1378">But the kids, my son, my daughter, especially my daughter, she didn't like me talk about this.</span> <span id="s1379">But they know everything what I went through.</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">Q: Now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">A: Yeah, you know.</span> <span id="s1382">My daughter went with me to Washington, to the Holocaust, when I was there, my grandson, and they saw everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">Q: Let me ask you, I don't know if you've thought about this, but I'm sure that these experiences had a long term impact on the way.</span> <span id="s1384">I'm trying to get a sense of how these experiences impacted you later maybe in terms of the way you raised your kids, and the way that you live today.</span> <span id="s1385">Maybe certain fears you had, certain values.</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">A: Well I didn't have no fears later on but I was sorry when I had so much trouble, you know, here.</span> <span id="s1387">I was sorry.</span> <span id="s1388">I used to say to my husband, "why I survived?</span> <span id="s1389">What I have accomplished in my life?</span> <span id="s1390">What I have accomplished"?</span> <span id="s1391">I have no joy, no nockis (ph), but maybe that time I was really angry, you know, what I did and why I came here, and what I went through a lot here.</span> <span id="s1392">Everything from the beginning.</span> <span id="s1393">How many times you can start?</span> <span id="s1394">Start and start, and went through everything.</span> <span id="s1395">But then I figure out, still I have a family, I have to raise them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">Maybe later on I'm going to have more joy, more nockis (ph), more Yiddish nockis (ph), you know?</span> <span id="s1397">And that's all, and that's what it is.</span> <span id="s1398">Now I have all the time with sickness.</span> <span id="s1399">My husband is a sick man.</span> <span id="s1400">Last year he was twice in hospital and they put him a pacemaker.</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">Listen, we're getting older, everything comes out.</span> <span id="s1402">We are not so strong anymore.</span> <span id="s1403">We can't take things what I used to take.</span> <span id="s1404">I said all the time to my daughter, I said, "what I used to do, I can't do nothing here now.</span> <span id="s1405">She said, "you can do it, you are a strong woman, you will be strong with us and with the life".</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">Q: Do you think that you raised your children differently because of your experiences than you might of had you a normal background?</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">A: No, I don't think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">Q: Are there certain situations you're in, certain noises, certain smells, that remind you of your life in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s1410">The only place is in the house, by me in the house.</span> <span id="s1411">Every Friday night, this is never going to go away from me.</span> <span id="s1412">When I'm lighting the candles, my husband is coming from Shull (ph), is making Kiddish (ph), you know what Kiddish (ph) is.</span> <span id="s1413">I'm missing.</span> <span id="s1414">The first years was terrible.</span> <span id="s1415">Later on, you know, I got used to it.</span> <span id="s1416">Thought, this has to be, it's not going to come any more.</span> <span id="s1417">I survived, and I have to live to see a little nockis (ph), for my kids, for my grandchildren.</span> <span id="s1418">We should only be well.</span> <span id="s1419">This is my first and the main thing, you know, to live a few years like human being.</span> <span id="s1420">To see something.</span> <span id="s1421">But on the other hand when you are sick, you can't go away, you can't travel far away.</span> <span id="s1422">Three years ago we was in Israel for the bar mitzvah for my grandson.</span> <span id="s1423">We had a beautiful time, we enjoyed so much.</span> <span id="s1424">And now, who knows?</span> <span id="s1425">God knows when we're going to go again because you have to go constantly to doctors with medicine, to keep up with appointments.</span> <span id="s1426">So we happy for this, we getting up in the morning, we get dressed, thank God for this.</span> <span id="s1427">What is more to ask now?</span> <span id="s1428">Nothing more.</span> <span id="s1429">I have my own home, we have a car, we're still driving.</span> <span id="s1430">We are not so poor.</span> <span id="s1431">We raised the children and they are like, we say in Yiddish, "To Godt and to light" (ph), you know what it means?</span> <span id="s1432">"To God and to people".</span> <span id="s1433">And they are nice children, very devoted to us.</span> <span id="s1434">My daughter calls me when she goes to work, and at work, and when she comes from work.</span> <span id="s1435">And every day she's coming, whatever.</span> <span id="s1436">"You don't feel good?</span> <span id="s1437">I'll take you to the doctor and tell me the truth.</span> <span id="s1438">Tell me the truth".</span> <span id="s1439">Not all the time I can tell her the truth how I feel because she feels bad too.</span> <span id="s1440">Beside this, she's a European girl, it's different too.</span> <span id="s1441">But now you can, I mean the, she's without the accent, so is my son.</span> <span id="s1442">He was born here.</span> <span id="s1443">And that's what it is.</span> <span id="s1444">We still struggle now for the health.</span> <span id="s1445">Before it was for work, for money, for life to live.</span> <span id="s1446">And now it's for health.</span> <span id="s1447">God should give us only a few good years to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">Q: I'm finished asking you questions.</span> <span id="s1449">Is there anything else you want to say to conclude this?</span> <span id="s1450">Or anything you want to tell your grandchildren?</span></p> <p><span id="s1451">A: That I survived.</span> <span id="s1452">I went through a lot in my life and with God's help, I lived to have my own children and I lived to have grandchildren.</span> <span id="s1453">And maybe if God would help me, I should live and to see great grandchildren, and to have nockis (ph) from them, from all of them.</span> <span id="s1454">And God should give us health for another few years, without any trouble, without what I went through in my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">Conclusion of Interview</span></p></body></html>
