In his laboratory they discovered testosterone.</span> <span id="s35">So, he is one of the first hormone researchers and I grew up when you asked me about childhood, that my father would put Ponds Cold Cream on one cheek and another hormone cream on the other cheek to see which one worked better.</span> <span id="s36">I think it was the Ponds.</span> <span id="s37">O.K. Early childhood, what more do you want to know?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q:Brothers and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A:Let me just quickly tell you about my mother because my mother was the artist in the family.</span> <span id="s40">She sang.</span> <span id="s41">She painted.</span> <span id="s42">She was a terrific painter and terrific singer also a good looking woman.</span> <span id="s43">Titian kind of reddish hair and lousy taste in everything except in art and music.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q:What do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A:Lousy taste because she wouldn't throw out a thing and she would buy crap because she was stingy.</span> <span id="s46">So, we didn't grow up in a house full of beautiful objects.</span> <span id="s47">We grew up with whatever was available.</span> <span id="s48">Never had a decent new bought dress in my youth because that's the way they were brought up.</span> <span id="s49">You get hand me downs.</span> <span id="s50">We were five children.</span> <span id="s51">There was an older sister and older brother.</span> <span id="s52">Me and my younger sister, so five.</span> <span id="s53">I think one of the reasons why I got very orderly and very much into beautiful things, whatever, was a reaction to this kind of wild household.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">01:05:48 But intellectually I think I owe both my parents the interest in literature, art, medicine, anything.</span> <span id="s55">Anything except politics.</span> <span id="s56">Politics did not play a role.</span> <span id="s57">Religion was a very strange situation because my father and mother were both Jewish racially,but had never, ever been in a synagogue.</span> <span id="s58">Even in Germany, so my father was born 1880.</span> <span id="s59">My mother was born 1883.</span> <span id="s60">I've personally never been in a synagogue except when I travel and if I'm in a group or if I'm in Turkey then the guide goes and shows me a synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">01:06:28</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q:Were you conscious of the background of being Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A:I was conscious of this background and made more conscious of it by a sheer fluke.</span> <span id="s64">The schools in Holland are not like here, private or public.</span> <span id="s65">Every school was public.</span> <span id="s66">You went to public kindergarten, public lower grade, middle school, whatever and then high school is Gymnasium.</span> <span id="s67">To go into a university you had to go at that time into a certain school which prepared you for the university.</span> <span id="s68">If you went into a trade, there was another school.</span> <span id="s69">But if you had...If you didn't want to go to university, I couldn't make it to the university school, I was too stupid.</span> <span id="s70">I jumped from what they call a girl's school into the second class of the Gymnasium.</span> <span id="s71">I wasn't all that stupid I was just in protest.</span> <span id="s72">What made me very interested in religion, I was 11 or 12 and I had to go, let's say, into the school where you either go to university to stay in a trade school or you could get a girl's education.</span> <span id="s73">At that time it was just nothing.</span> <span id="s74">And, I was a biker.</span> <span id="s75">Like all Dutch kids, you were born on a bike and I biked and I was careless.</span> <span id="s76">And they wanted to put me in a certain school which was right around the neighborhood because then I wouldn't bike so far and come home with a broken leg or whatever.</span> <span id="s77">I got put into that school.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">01:08:28 It was a so called Hervormd Lyceum which is not only Lutheran but it is the Reformed Lutheran church, so the most Calvinistic sect of the Lutheran church you can be in.</span> <span id="s79">That was my school, because it was in the neighborhood.</span> <span id="s80">Then the school moved out of the neighborhood and I was in the school anyway, but there comes my religion.</span> <span id="s81">My religious background was Sunday school, Christian.</span> <span id="s82">It was prayer every morning and so and so on.</span> <span id="s83">And it had some Jewish children.</span> <span id="s84">I wonder whether they were there because it was the neighborhood.</span> <span id="s85">I think they were there because it was a very good school.</span> <span id="s86">And so, this is where the Christian background comes from.</span> <span id="s87">The other thing, there is a habit in my family which is very German that came Christmas around, number one we had a tree.</span> <span id="s88">Number two the kids were supposed to recite the Christmas story under the Christmas tree.</span> <span id="s89">The oldest kid first and by the time it reached me and my sister, it must have been close to the middle 30s, Hitler was there already because I was born in '19.</span> <span id="s90">So this was the Christian background.</span> <span id="s91">Jews were never mentioned except after '33.</span> <span id="s92">'33 the first immigrants came from Germany fleeing Hitler and my father immediately got into committees, helped and was on refugees committees.</span> <span id="s93">We had refugees all over the place, and we were aware of it, how lucky we were that we did not grow up in Germany but in Holland.</span> <span id="s94">I had also problems in school because they knew that my parents were Germans and the Dutch kids hated Germans.</span> <span id="s95">They had nicknames for them like in France the Bosches and we called them the Moffen.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">01:10:40 I was always the child of a moff father, which was a German father.</span> <span id="s97">The problem was that he was a professor, that he lectured at the University and that he was so ungifted with language that he never learned decent Dutch so that the students finally said, “Professor Laqueur do us a favor, talk in German because we can't understand you.”</span> <span id="s98">So, he lectured in German, but wrote in German, English, whatever they wrote in at the time.</span> <span id="s99">I think they all still wrote in German.</span> <span id="s100">Nobody wrote in English, in medical text.</span> <span id="s101">Dutch, you didn't write because nobody could read it, but they wrote German.</span> <span id="s102">They changed it.</span> <span id="s103">Science was German.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q:Tell me about your brothers and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A:Brothers and sisters.</span> <span id="s106">The oldest sister was a woman, was a girl and she died after Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s107">Nobody knows about this.</span> <span id="s108">I never mention her in the diary.</span> <span id="s109">She was over 40.</span> <span id="s110">She was born in 1906 so if the war was from 1943 to '45 she was over 40 or close to 40 and anybody who got typhus died over 40 because of the high consistent fever for 15 to 16 days and whatever.</span> <span id="s111">She lived outside of Holland for part of her married life.</span> <span id="s112">She was married to a doctor in Czechoslovakia and then came my second brother.</span> <span id="s113">My second brother, Peter, studied medicine and biochemistry and also got into endocrinology.</span> <span id="s114">He immigrated to South America just before 1940, in 1939 because there was a branch of the factory which made the hormones, Organon, which was part of Hoffman La-Roche, that's where our money comes from.</span> <span id="s115">So, there was a combination of pharmaceutical, endocrinology pharmacology on that side.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">01:13:06 My brother, Peter, was an M.D. and Ph.D. and in South America.</span> <span id="s117">He emigrated later on after the war in 1946 to New York and switched to psychiatry because of the drugs.</span> <span id="s118">The third brother was five years older than I.</span> <span id="s119">He did study medicine, but flunked out because he had the feeling, you know, you studied medicine because your father and your brother studied medicine.</span> <span id="s120">And he became a businessman, first photography and film in the 1930.</span> <span id="s121">Went to the Berlin Olympiad to film.</span> <span id="s122">I just saw on PBS the other day and I realized that Hein my brother was there for the Olympiad just to film.</span> <span id="s123">He was born in ‘14 so he was 22, 24.</span> <span id="s124">I guess.</span> <span id="s125">And the younger sister, Lilo, is the one who lives in Boston.</span> <span id="s126">She was born in 1922.</span> <span id="s127">Went to school in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s128">All the other kids went to normal schools.</span> <span id="s129">They went to public schools.</span> <span id="s130">Nobody went to this Lutheran Calvinistic outfit where I went.</span> <span id="s131">None of them was as Christian as I was, because I saw it.</span> <span id="s132">I have to pray and I also tried to become a Catholic but that's a different story.</span> <span id="s133">I had a Catholic boyfriend, but never Jewish.</span> <span id="s134">So, Lilo married in Holland a German refugee who was in international insurance, marine insurance with whom she immigrated in 1947 to New York and she lived in West Westchester and had three children and is today retired in Boston.</span> <span id="s135">She's a registered nurse.</span> <span id="s136">Again, medicine, there's always medicine somewhere.</span> <span id="s137">That's the kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">01:15:24 Now, my mother died in 1959 and my father died in 1967 in a very strange situation.</span> <span id="s139">He was with his girlfriend in Switzerland and he was somewhere in Zermatt near the very high mountains and the Swiss Post Auto, you know, one of those busses squeezed a woman who was running against the wall and she died.</span> <span id="s140">And he, as a physician, was called in and while he was administering help to this woman, he died of a heart attack.</span> <span id="s141">He had a bad heart, bad kidneys, bad heart, so this is the story of my father and there were write ups all over the New York Times, all over Europe.</span> <span id="s142">Ernst Laqueur died while he was trying to help somebody not to die.</span> <span id="s143">A question...</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q:What was dinnertime like at your house with all these kids and your parents, what kind of a ...?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A:That’s an interesting question.</span> <span id="s146">First let me tell you about the food.</span> <span id="s147">The food was always too much and too heavy.</span> <span id="s148">Everybody was heavy.</span> <span id="s149">I learned.</span> <span id="s150">My people in New York told me I want to be -- what do you want to be.</span> <span id="s151">I said, “I want to be what I should be.”</span> <span id="s152">She said, “You cut everything you eat in half.”</span> <span id="s153">I never went on a diet.</span> <span id="s154">I lost what I had to lose and stayed that way for the rest of my life.</span> <span id="s155">Father disciplined because children were brought up not to talk unless they were asked questions.</span> <span id="s156">Children were there to be looked at, but not to be heard.</span> <span id="s157">We were very well brought up.</span> <span id="s158">We also had nannies.</span> <span id="s159">We had a nanny, we had a cook, we had whatever and the nanny was, in many ways, more important than the mother.</span> <span id="s160">The mother was there when you were sick and when you were in trouble with your father, she would mediate.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">01:18:03 My mother was called, surprisingly, an avalanche which rolls up the mountain.</span> <span id="s162">She was that forceful.</span> <span id="s163">She ran the house in many ways and my father was the guy behind the desk, always on the phone, always public relations.</span> <span id="s164">I learned public relations from him.</span> <span id="s165">Public relations before the word existed.</span> <span id="s166">Team work, working with people was my father.</span> <span id="s167">My mother was an individualist and totally you do what you feel like as long as you don't run into trouble with the law, and that's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q:Was she warm?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A:Was she what?</span> <span id="s170">Yes, very warm, but also very egocentric.</span> <span id="s171">If she was warm, you were warm., but if she was cold and she didn't understand you, she wanted you warm, and it wasn't that easy.</span> <span id="s172">The sense of humor strangely enough was my father.</span> <span id="s173">He had a kind of a understated...he couldn't have survived with that woman next to him if he wouldn't have had a kind of certain distance and a kind of an ironization of his own position.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q:Did you think they were in love with each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A:No, and I think this has been one of the traumatic things.</span> <span id="s176">I never talked about that because to me it's so natural that I always knew he had girlfriends, but I also knew that the girl friends were not sexual and this is something which I never understood.</span> <span id="s177">Girlfriends were achievements.</span> <span id="s178">They were either just -- I hope this doesn't go anywhere because this is purely personal -- they were either very beautiful or very famous or both or they needed him because he could provide whatever they wanted.</span> <span id="s179">It wasn’t persecution.</span> <span id="s180">It was a very complex relationship because I think sexually he didn't function.</span> <span id="s181">I found that out by talking to one of them.</span> <span id="s182">I mean, I was the one who became very...and there was another thing.</span> <span id="s183">I had tremendous problems as a teenager and as a young woman because my father was afraid of temperament.</span> <span id="s184">Afraid of passion, afraid of sexual involvement and he warned me, he said you're dark.</span> <span id="s185">I was dark.</span> <span id="s186">Today I'm gray.</span> <span id="s187">You look like a gypsy and you look aggressive.</span> <span id="s188">I didn't even know what he was talking about but I understood much later that this was his fear.</span> <span id="s189">He loved me and he said, “You will never need to do anything except get married.”</span> <span id="s190">I think I started at the ripe old age between 40 and 51 to prove that I could do other things but get married.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">01:21:41 But when you ask me, “Did they love each other?”</span> <span id="s192">They may have been in love for a very short time, but again to give you the 19th century, when he married my mother, who was, of course, a virgin when he married her in 1905, he said, “If you don't have a son or a daughter in a year, it's over.”</span> <span id="s193">So, in other words, he wanted to propagate and I don't know -- I don't know whether these stories are true but this is what I remember in my family and there are other things that I remember which are not showing love.</span> <span id="s194">You're so long together, you stick it out.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q:Were you close to any of your brothers and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A:I was very close to my middle brother who was five years older when he was very young and I became very much estranged from him in the last 20 years of his life because he was to my mind, too narrow minded.</span> <span id="s197">For instance, he never forgave me that I went back to Germany.</span> <span id="s198">He never forgave me that I wrote the dissertation and that I kind of published our background in the sense of, from my grandparents already tried to escape.</span> <span id="s199">“And now you describe this whole business again, what it was to be a German, now you get involved in the whole Hitler aftermath.”</span> <span id="s200">That became very difficult because I thought, “How narrow minded can you be.</span> <span id="s201">You know damn well it's not my problem.”</span> <span id="s202">I am delighted that I survived and I had the guts to write a diary.</span> <span id="s203">Then somebody else picked it up and published it.</span> <span id="s204">I gave it to a publisher because it was there in Holland, it was nothing.</span> <span id="s205">It was typed, but I never did anything with it.</span> <span id="s206">I have actually never done anything until now.</span> <span id="s207">This is the last time that I try to get this published in English.</span> <span id="s208">I've had it.</span> <span id="s209">Let it sit somewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">01:24:11</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q:What did you like in school, what subjects?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A:You better say what did I not like.</span> <span id="s213">What I didn't like was science and math and anything to do with that which wasn't language.</span> <span id="s214">I loved geology, geography and all that stuff but no mathematics, no science.</span> <span id="s215">Even when I came to New York and I wanted to study I talked Columbia and NYU into giving me a year off so I got instead of 128 points I only had to do whatever and I said no science.</span> <span id="s216">I'm never going to go anything with science.</span> <span id="s217">I regret it today because I ended up in medicine at the age of 60, but anyway.</span> <span id="s218">I liked going to school.</span> <span id="s219">I liked to learn and I like kids and I like to be with people.</span> <span id="s220">I have no problems.</span> <span id="s221">I had a very good childhood.</span> <span id="s222">I was strong, tough and I loved to just play.</span> <span id="s223">No, beef at all.</span> <span id="s224">I had a wonderful childhood.</span> <span id="s225">I knew I didn't get the stuff I wanted in clothes.</span> <span id="s226">I knew I didn't get ever a room which was filled with beautiful objects.</span> <span id="s227">I always saw them but I knew I wouldn't get them.</span> <span id="s228">Later on I did get them, so what else?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q:When you graduated Gymnasium --?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A:Eighteen.</span> <span id="s231">I was eighteen.</span> <span id="s232">I wanted to study and my father said no.</span> <span id="s233">It was 1938 and he said my daughter doesn't go to university and he was right.</span> <span id="s234">He said, “You first learn something which you can do anywhere in the world.”</span> <span id="s235">I mean this was '38.</span> <span id="s236">The war in Munich had happened and peace was just a matter of negotiation and most likely never, and he said, “You can go to University maybe if you have done this, but go to secretarial school.”</span> <span id="s237">He was right.</span> <span id="s238">He said, “You're good in languages.</span> <span id="s239">You're good, learn shorthand, typing, bookkeeping, all this stuff.”</span> <span id="s240">He sent me to the best secretarial school, an international school in Holland and I did this for a year and a half and I had a diploma.</span> <span id="s241">I ended working in Montreal when I immigrated in French, German and English in shorthand because I translated my Dutch into whatever and so on...I could make a living wherever I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q:When the Nazis took over in Germany --?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A:That was in May 1940 the Nazis took over.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q:I know in Holland, but I'm talking about what was happening in Germany.</span> <span id="s245">Were you thinking about what was going on in Germany?</span> <span id="s246">You had your grandparents --?</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A:I was constantly...Only one grandmother and the grandmother was brought to Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s248">I forget which year, but she certainly came--either in ‘30--after the Kristallnacht, so after November 1938.</span> <span id="s249">Maybe a year earlier but I don't remember that.</span> <span id="s250">But she was my mother's mother.</span> <span id="s251">She came.</span> <span id="s252">I was not concerned about family.</span> <span id="s253">I was concerned about, quote unquote, "the immigrants," because we were made to feel guilty that we had to do something because there, but for the grace of God, would we be moving, so I resented them.</span> <span id="s254">If you have to do something, it doesn't come from the heart but it comes because your father said like they said later on, “Eat your stuff because the people in Europe are hungry.”</span></p> <p><span id="s255">01:28:15</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q:So, what were your obligations?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A:Obligations were to see and be with people who were in deep trouble.</span> <span id="s258">These were my obligations.</span> <span id="s259">We were told that tonight, let's say, a conductor or a professor or a this or a that is coming.</span> <span id="s260">You know, we had very many people who immigrated, who came via Holland and went on to America.</span> <span id="s261">I remember a house full of famous people who came through.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q:And they stayed with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A:They stayed with my parents and the sponsorship was always the business about how do they get to America, because they have to have the guarantee of a sponsor and so on.</span> <span id="s264">You know, the finding relations and connections and this is what I remember about immigration and whether it was people they talked about whether it was a Thomas Mann or whether it was a Bruno Walter or who was or whatever or chemist or musician, he was also into music.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">01:29:35 He was a board member of the “Concertgebouw Orchestra”, so this is Lincoln Center.</span> <span id="s266">So, we got all these people from the theater, from the concerts, from music and from science and I remember life was interesting but there was always this feeling of guilt.</span> <span id="s267">Guilt by what would...I think I'm talking now with hindsight.</span> <span id="s268">I'm not sure that I thought this or I'm making it up.</span> <span id="s269">If you are a kid between, let's say, 10 and 16 and you're constantly surrounded by people you would have been if your parents wouldn't have done this or that, that's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q:Do you remember any particular people or conversation, did they engage with you or were you also sitting there being a very quiet young lady?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A:No, I was never quiet.</span> <span id="s272">No, I asked questions but I remember fascinating, being fascinated by stories by the first -- honestly Joan, I don't know any more what is memory and what I'm making up.</span> <span id="s273">This is why I don't like this kind of interview.</span> <span id="s274">You talk about something which you feel today.</span> <span id="s275">I am not 100 percent.</span> <span id="s276">I am terribly aware of authenticity.</span> <span id="s277">This comes through my research and the feeling of afterwards, pre, during, and afterwards and what you felt before something happened or while it happened or what had happened afterwards to differentiate which is the real thing.</span> <span id="s278">I can only swear to what I really remember almost physically, but if it's purely mental, it's very difficult to remember a conversation.</span> <span id="s279">I remember all kinds of faces, all kinds of discussions about music, art, going to school, but I don't know who said what, so I don't want to talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">01:32:14</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q:Were there ever any children that came through with these people or were these mainly men, famous men, who were coming through?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A:There were families, but I don't remember any children.</span> <span id="s283">I only remember that they would come to dinner or that the word was said, “There's another one coming.”</span> <span id="s284">So, it was -- I wish my sister were here, because my sister would say how come you remember the annoyance factor.</span> <span id="s285">Joan, I have never thought about it.</span> <span id="s286">I have never voiced this.</span> <span id="s287">This is the first time, when you said, “Have you ever talked about it?”</span> <span id="s288">No.</span> <span id="s289">That's so interesting about it.</span> <span id="s290">The interesting thing is that you go through it and you come out of it, and that is I think is not my doing.</span> <span id="s291">It's sheer luck and chutzpah.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q:When the war starts in Poland in 1939 --?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A:That I remember.</span> <span id="s294">September 3, you first get the declaration of war of the English.</span> <span id="s295">I'll never forget that because the radio was on day and night, BBC, whatever.</span> <span id="s296">Holland was free.</span> <span id="s297">We were on the radio.</span> <span id="s298">There was no television, but when Poland started, that was the beginning of the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q:Do you remember that a few months later or around the same time that Westerbork opened for illegal refugees?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A:I don't remember but I know about it historically because I read about.</span> <span id="s301">I never heard about it, never.</span> <span id="s302">I didn't hear about Westerbork.</span> <span id="s303">I don't know.</span> <span id="s304">I may have heard about it because I think one of my "cousins" came via Hamberg where his parents were, he came through a children's camp into Westerbork, which was just before the war.</span> <span id="s305">So Westerbork was a kind of receptacle for immigrants.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q:Now, were you conscious of the Nazi party in Holland?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A:No, never heard about it until May 1940, and not even then.</span> <span id="s308">Only I would say after the surrender when the queen had left and the NSB didn't kick up.</span> <span id="s309">We knew there was such a thing like it was something in Britain.</span> <span id="s310">Also there was something in Holland.</span> <span id="s311">There were people who were anti-Mussolini, we knew that.</span> <span id="s312">I’m trying to think.</span> <span id="s313">I think in my Gymnasium class, I graduated in '38, there was definitely a color line against the people from the colonies, Javanese, what you call the Katjang and there was Anti-Semitism and Anti-Catholicism.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">01:35:30 There was a lot of anti- stuff.</span> <span id="s315">Protestant versus Catholics reminds of Ireland and Holland.</span> <span id="s316">You have a very strong division line where the river, the Rhine, and the--anything below is Catholic and anything above is Protestant.</span> <span id="s317">So, the northern Frisians don't talk to the people of Brabant because they are Catholics versus Calvinists.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q:How did that affect you?</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A:It affected me very much because I was in a school which was pretty anti-Catholic because it was purely Calvinistic.</span> <span id="s320">I mean I learned about these things.</span> <span id="s321">It didn't affect me, but it didn't affect me except that I don't know how these things affect you.</span> <span id="s322">I have never gone to Spain except under duress because I was raised in Holland.</span> <span id="s323">Because of the Duke of Alba and because of Philip II and when I wanted to go to the Escorial in Madrid my husband said, “Are you crazy?”</span></p> <p><span id="s324">01:36:36 This goes back to your history teaching of Holland between the age of six and the age of 12.</span> <span id="s325">I said, “That's it.</span> <span id="s326">Who wants to go to Spain.”</span> <span id="s327">This biased we were.</span> <span id="s328">Because the 80 years war never stopped in Holland.</span> <span id="s329">That's why I understand the Irish so well.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q:When you say that there was Anti-Semitism as well as Anti-Catholicism --</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A:Anti-Semitism in the sense that they thought Jews were people who--Wall Street--didn't exist for us, but who were were either bankers or, usurers, medieval thing, or they were selling oranges on the street or, what is it?</span> <span id="s332">Voddeman.</span> <span id="s333">Old clothes.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">01:37:30 So, Jews were either bankers...They were neither lawyers or doctors.</span> <span id="s335">Not like in New York or in America.</span> <span id="s336">But there were these kind of medieval restrictive kind of thoughts and yet Holland is the place after all with Erasmus and the philosophy and the Jewish philosophers.</span> <span id="s337">So, it's a weird place to grow up.</span> <span id="s338">Very advanced and very restricted.</span> <span id="s339">Advanced in the sense that there were sea farers and everything with the sea and broadening the horizon and going all over the world and being Dutch meant that you traveled and at the same time being very narrow minded.</span> <span id="s340">Sitting behind a tiny little window and looking into the street.</span> <span id="s341">You know the look out corner of a window?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q:Did you have any identification problems at this point given what was going on with the Jewish refugees coming in?</span> <span id="s343">Did you identify with them, as much as you may have resented them?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A:No, I didn't identify in the sense except for a feeling of gratefulness and thank God I'm in Holland.</span> <span id="s345">To me feeling that anything would happen in Holland didn't occur to me.</span> <span id="s346">That didn't occur until we got the Wehrmacht, the orders from the occupational army to fill in forms that you had Jewish grandparents and I remember my wild resentment to my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">01:39:11 I said, “Don't be such a goddamn Prussian, don't fill in anything.”</span> <span id="s348">If he wouldn't have filled it in we would have been all okay.</span> <span id="s349">Because--That's why I kept saying Prussian prejudice and Prussian education.</span> <span id="s350">There's another problem that also comes out in the book Schreiben KZ in the introduction, because my German editors insisted that I give my story about my father and he said, "If you don't give it we have it in the Frankfurter Allegemeine Zeitung Archives."</span> <span id="s351">So I said, “Okay, here it is”.</span> <span id="s352">He is born in 1880.</span> <span id="s353">He is a German.</span> <span id="s354">He is a medical professional.</span> <span id="s355">He is a teacher at the universities, various universities.</span> <span id="s356">The war breaks out in 1914.</span> <span id="s357">He is a German.</span> <span id="s358">He volunteers into the army as a medical officer.</span> <span id="s359">Imagine growing up in Holland and having a father who was a volunteer in the German army.</span> <span id="s360">Okay, number one, he is then, because he is a Pharmacologist he is being sent to Belgium.</span> <span id="s361">In Belgium the have a Gas Schule, a Gas School in Berlin where they experiment with poisonous gas for the war.</span> <span id="s362">From '14 to '18 Laqueur is in the gas schule.</span> <span id="s363">He only does research.</span> <span id="s364">He has no idea what the research is for, but he does research as a Pharmacologist.</span> <span id="s365">He's being sent to Belgium as an occupation army, you know, from '14 to '18.</span> <span id="s366">He ends up with a death sentence in Belgium because they say, “If you ever come back we'll kill you.”</span> <span id="s367">So, for the rest of his life, when we were children, he travels to Switzerland where we have a chalet in the summer.</span> <span id="s368">He travels on the Belgium French side, we travel in the third railroad car with my mother on the German side.</span> <span id="s369">These are the things they knew in Germany and my friend and editor Martina in Frankfurt said, “Renata, if you don't tell us these stories we have them anyway because the Germans knew about this.”</span> <span id="s370">I think it's only funny, but of course I don't blame my father.</span> <span id="s371">If you were an American and if ...we have never been occupied in America, but if the occupational-- yes we have been occupiers.</span> <span id="s372">We have occupied Germany.</span> <span id="s373">We have occupied whatever.</span> <span id="s374">So, if you then do something because your government tells you to do this or that, do you or don't you?</span> <span id="s375">But there are other things which made me nervous about this interview because my own bad conscience comes in, I hated to be my father's daughter in Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">01:42:44 I never forget the last talk I had with my father in 1947 before he went to Switzerland and he was a sick man, he had cardio and kidney problems and I said, “Why did you go into the army?”</span> <span id="s377">Why this or that and he simply had no other explanation but, “This is my duty.”</span> <span id="s378">Again the Prussian.</span> <span id="s379">Duty, honor, --ugh.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q:So when he puts down that he has Jewish parents --?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A:Then he gets like everybody else, a "J" on his identity thing.</span> <span id="s382">My mother gets a "J," and his children unless they were married to non-Jews and then they started working around it.</span> <span id="s383">My middle brother is exempted because my mother said, “I had another guy and he's the son of another guy.”</span> <span id="s384">And this gets all taken into paper and it's all very complicated and so he is out of the story.</span> <span id="s385">My sister isn't married so she still has a "J" and she lives with my parents, and I am married and I married a Jewish boy who was baptized, Paul.</span> <span id="s386">We wanted to disappear, you know, go underground and my father said, “Don't do this because if you do this you endanger my staying and, let’s say, being tolerated.”</span> <span id="s387">Because the Germans, because of his relationship to the industry, to the pharmacological industry, they wanted shares so badly of his outside involvement in South America and in America and they tried to pressure him into giving them access to his money.</span> <span id="s388">He never did.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q:To your father's money?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A:They never succeeded but meanwhile they kept saying "Laqueur, you can stay in your house.</span> <span id="s391">You can do whatever you can do," but of course his job was gone because he had to be sacked as a professor because you couldn't stay in the university if you were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">01:45:20 But they left him until the end of the war.</span> <span id="s393">Of course there were stories about it that he sold his children to the concentration camp because he could stay home.</span> <span id="s394">Nonsense.</span> <span id="s395">It had nothing to do with him.</span> <span id="s396">We were arrested because we were Jewish.</span> <span id="s397">We had a "J" and I had done some illegal stuff, and a..</span> <span id="s398">.</span> <span id="s399">and stuff, documents.</span> <span id="s400">It's a very complicated story.</span> <span id="s401">Anyway I ended up in prison in Amsterdam and then a Dutch concentration camp which was worse than anything else.</span> <span id="s402">Then being shipped to Westerbork and then my father, with his good connections in the Hague and with Berlin, got me out of Westerbork and I came back out.</span> <span id="s403">Then Paul and I said to my father, “Now it's time that we go underground, because I don't want to be shipped ever again to Westerbork.”</span> <span id="s404">The transportations were going to the East.</span> <span id="s405">We didn't know what happened there, but I didn't want to be shipped.</span> <span id="s406">He said, “You can't do this.</span> <span id="s407">You just stay where you are.</span> <span id="s408">I will try to salvage whatever I can.”</span> <span id="s409">He bought us Ecuadorian passports.</span> <span id="s410">We got Venezuelan passports.</span> <span id="s411">We got immigration stuff to go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s412">We had everything, every paper in the world.</span> <span id="s413">Then we got picked up because with the Germans there was always one word, Bis auf Wieteres, until further notice.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">01:46:57 So, in other words, if you had an exemption that could explode from one hour to the next, and our so called Stempel, stamp had expired and we were shipped to a so called preference camp which was Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s415">At that time it wasn't a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s416">It was for the children of notable people.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q:Can we go back?</span> <span id="s418">First I want to --</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A:I'm talking much too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q:No, that’s the idea.</span> <span id="s421">Tell me how you met your husband.</span> <span id="s422">I want to get a little bit of a sense of who he was.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A:That also has to do with the war.</span> <span id="s424">I met Paul in May '40 when we were overrun by the Germans.</span> <span id="s425">I meet him bicycling with a member of a family that I knew and I meet him and we fall in love.</span> <span id="s426">It's May, June 1940.</span> <span id="s427">He's my first man and being well brought up you marry the first man.</span> <span id="s428">We have a love affair and then I tell my father that I slept with him and he almost killed me for that.</span> <span id="s429">I said, “Don't worry, we'll get married.”</span> <span id="s430">He said, “You shouldn't get married because you will get divorced right after.”</span> <span id="s431">He was right, but he said, “Do you want to marry?”</span> <span id="s432">I said, “Yes, I want to marry because otherwise we can't live together.”</span> <span id="s433">Because there were certain orders from the Germans that you couldn't live in this city and in that city you had to live together.</span> <span id="s434">They were making restrictions on where you lived and what you did and so on.</span> <span id="s435">It was the ghetto mentality already.</span> <span id="s436">So, Paul and I got married and the two fathers, Father Goldschmidt, Paul Goldschmidt, his ancestry was German but he had been three or four generations in Holland and Father Goldschmidt and Father Laqueur got together and said, “Those kids are going to get divorced as soon as the war is over.</span> <span id="s437">What do we do about our money?”</span></p> <p><span id="s438">01:48:07 So, they said that each kid whatever they brought into the marriage would go back into their own family, and boy did that happen.</span> <span id="s439">But this is really very personal.</span> <span id="s440">When Paul and I got divorced in the 1950s, after I met my second husband -- this is a story I have to tell you, but it's purely personal.</span> <span id="s441">Anyway, to get to the money first, it got divided very nicely except that Paul said, “I can never pay you for saving my life.”</span> <span id="s442">I said, “You don't pay me.</span> <span id="s443">That’s a natural.</span> <span id="s444">I either saved your life or I let you rot.”</span> <span id="s445">So, whatever it was we got very amicably divorced.</span> <span id="s446">I gave him some share of my father’s LaRoche Organon stuff and he gave me some other stuff, but these are civilized marriages.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">01:50:10 We are still friends.</span> <span id="s448">The story of how I met Paul and how I met my second husband.</span> <span id="s449">Paul had been a speech therapist.</span> <span id="s450">He had dyslexia and that way got into speech trouble and interested in psychology and psychiatry but he had never made the Gymnasium so he could never study medicine.</span> <span id="s451">1950, after the war, there were stories, there were children and also no children and all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s452">In 1950 the first international speech therapy congress convention is in Amsterdam and Paul says to me, “Do you want to work for that?</span> <span id="s453">Do something because you're good with people and good with money and all that.”</span> <span id="s454">And I said, “I will be the treasurer.”</span> <span id="s455">I'm the treasurer, the general secretary of that international convention comes from New York.</span> <span id="s456">He is Deso A. Weiss, M.D.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">01:51:21 He has been Paul's teacher when he was a kid studying in Vienna, because he came from Austria, Vienna, Prague, whatever.</span> <span id="s458">Paul knew him and admired him as his teacher and his professor.</span> <span id="s459">He was 18 years older than me so he was also 13 years older than Paul.</span> <span id="s460">He said, “Don't ever start anything with him because one of these days I'm going to America and I don't want my wife to have a relationship with my professor.”</span> <span id="s461">You only have to say, “Don’t start,” and Renata starts.</span> <span id="s462">A week after I meet this guy, ten days, I said to Paul, "Paul, you're absolutely right."</span> <span id="s463">He doesn't know it yet, but I’m going to get this guy.</span> <span id="s464">I'm going to marry him.”</span> <span id="s465">He was in a bad marriage, no children.</span> <span id="s466">I knew about that.</span> <span id="s467">It had nothing to do with anything.</span> <span id="s468">I achieved that after four years.</span> <span id="s469">He was my second husband.</span> <span id="s470">He was the great love of my life.</span> <span id="s471">That’s Paul, Deso, and Renata.</span> <span id="s472">Everything was very friendly, very whatever.</span> <span id="s473">How did I meet Paul, we were young.</span> <span id="s474">We had the first sex and he liked my family.</span> <span id="s475">He said it was the craziest family he ever married into.</span> <span id="s476">I liked his too, but they were different.</span> <span id="s477">They were very formal, very -- totally different background.</span> <span id="s478">Totally business people, very rich.</span> <span id="s479">Not showy but very established and we were so bohemian.</span> <span id="s480">I've been talking for an hour.</span> <span id="s481">You said you wanted to give me a break after half an hour.</span> <span id="s482">How much more do we have to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q:Where were you living when you got married?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A:The first time or the second time?</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q:The first time, we're back in the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A:Amsterdam, and actually that is nice.</span> <span id="s487">I have a picture of that.</span> <span id="s488">Amsterdam, Burgerlijke Stand, which is the civil authority, no church, no nothing, no synagogue, no nothing, just a civil marriage.</span> <span id="s489">We were married on the 24th of December 1941.</span> <span id="s490">Christmas 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q:Who married you?</span></p> <p><span id="s492">A:I don't know.</span> <span id="s493">Some official in the -- what do you call it the registry where you're married?</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q:A civil ceremony?</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A:A civil ceremony.</span> <span id="s496">I don't know who it was.</span> <span id="s497">I just remember the second time when they said, “Two dollars please” in New York.</span> <span id="s498">That's all.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q:So, did you have a big party?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A:No, but I remember what I wanted for my wedding meal?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q:What?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A:I wanted frankfurters and I wanted sauerkraut and I wanted chocolate pudding.</span> <span id="s503">All things you couldn't get, and I got them on the black market.</span> <span id="s504">My mother got it.</span> <span id="s505">I wanted frankfurters, mashed potatoes, sauerkraut.</span> <span id="s506">I mean my taste has changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q:Was this typically Dutch?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A:It was Dutch.</span> <span id="s509">I mean, the frankfurters were not frankfurters, they were called something else.</span> <span id="s510">We didn’t put the word “frankfurter” to it.</span> <span id="s511">It was called Wiener Wurst, Viennese, and it was potatoes with gravy.</span> <span id="s512">You know as a kid you would have potatoes and you would make a hole in the middle and then the gravy would go in there and you would spoon this up instead of a fork.</span> <span id="s513">And then they would always say, “Don't eat the potatoes first.</span> <span id="s514">Eat your vegetables first.”</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q:Were there vegetables at this particular wedding?</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A:No, there were no vegetables.</span> <span id="s517">I wasn't yet a salad eater or veggie eater.</span> <span id="s518">I was still a meat eater.</span> <span id="s519">That's it.</span> <span id="s520">But only frankfurters.</span> <span id="s521">I didn't like meat.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q:Did you go away after the wedding?</span> <span id="s523">Did you have a little honeymoon?</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A:No.</span> <span id="s525">We had no honeymoon.</span> <span id="s526">We went... ah I forget where we went.</span> <span id="s527">We went to somebody's apartment.</span> <span id="s528">We had been living together.</span> <span id="s529">It was no honeymoon.</span> <span id="s530">We said after the war we would travel.</span> <span id="s531">I'd never been to Paris.</span> <span id="s532">So the things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q:One last question and then I think we'll have to take a break.</span> <span id="s534">Did he have a J on his passport also?</span> <span id="s535">On his identity card.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A:I don't know.</span> <span id="s537">I don't know!</span> <span id="s538">I guess so.</span> <span id="s539">I'm not even sure that I did, because I don't know anymore whether I had one or whether I just always hid it.</span> <span id="s540">I only know we had to wear that damn thing on the yellow star.</span> <span id="s541">That was the worst part.</span> <span id="s542">The feeling of always trying to hide it, that you had the star.</span> <span id="s543">You know we had to wear it on our clothes when we went on the street.</span> <span id="s544">And the restrictions was one of the part I remember, was the restrictions.</span> <span id="s545">You couldn't do this, you couldn't do that.</span> <span id="s546">You couldn't.</span> <span id="s547">You had no freedom.</span> <span id="s548">Taking away first your bike, and then no street car, and then no park and then this and then not this.</span> <span id="s549">And then all this, it's an unbelievable feeling.</span> <span id="s550">It has me, altered me so that I practically don't want to sign any form.</span> <span id="s551">I revolt against any signature on any paper, because of the effect of, if you put it down somebody else is going to abuse it.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q:And let's take a break.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A:Yes ma'am!</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q:We'll start with the restrictions when we come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A:We start with the restrictions?</span> <span id="s556">I'm very comfortable by the way.</span> <span id="s557">I don't have to take my jacket--</span></p> <p><span id="s558">01:58:08</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s560">02:01:55</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q:Renata, tell me about the movement of the restrictions that you felt because now you're identified as a Jew in some respects, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A:The restrictions I felt then or restrictions today?</span> <span id="s563">Today I feel no restrictions.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q:No, then.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A:This is one of the reasons why I'm particularly happy in New York.</span> <span id="s566">There are no restrictions.</span> <span id="s567">It's the freest city in the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q:No, I mean with the occupation of Holland?</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A:The occupation?</span> <span id="s570">What I felt is having grown up as a happy child and being with "normal people" who went to school or into business or whatever they were doing to be singled out as something which is in somebody's eyes, now I'm going to get into the concentration camp again, where you are vermin.</span> <span id="s571">Here we weren't vermin, we were just abnormal.</span> <span id="s572">We were singled out because we were something they wanted to get rid of.</span> <span id="s573">And, to be singled out is something which I have never liked.</span> <span id="s574">If it's good, not, and if it's bad, not because I like to be just able to be free and choose the fact that I had no more choices.</span> <span id="s575">My choices were taken away, whether I wanted to go to the park or to the movies or take a street car or buy something not before 3:00 in the afternoon and not in a certain store.</span> <span id="s576">It is something that I've always objected to.</span> <span id="s577">Not having choice and it gets the worst when they imprison you, because you have no choices.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q:How did you find the Dutch population, your friends that you had before, now that you're under those restrictions and they're not?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A:The interesting thing is, Joan, I thought about it but I just don't remember anything.</span> <span id="s580">I don't think that I lost anybody.</span> <span id="s581">I don't think I saw anybody less.</span> <span id="s582">I don't know.</span> <span id="s583">I have no memory because I'm such an egocentric and selective memorizer.</span> <span id="s584">It's a good question.</span> <span id="s585">I don't know.</span> <span id="s586">I think nobody really reacted wrong because I didn't know anybody who was in the pro-Hitler.</span> <span id="s587">And don't forget that it is a very free and open society and democratic which is over run by a tyrant so that they were all against him.</span> <span id="s588">And whether I was singled out, they were singled out if they were Catholic or Communist or homosexual or whatever.</span> <span id="s589">There were so many people singled out.</span> <span id="s590">It wasn't just Jews.</span> <span id="s591">You were a victim because, you were what do you call it?</span> <span id="s592">Occupied.</span> <span id="s593">Occupied means they sit on top of you and you have restrictions.</span> <span id="s594">Almost everybody had restrictions.</span> <span id="s595">The Jews had different restrictions than other people.</span> <span id="s596">There was constant curfew.</span> <span id="s597">There was black out.</span> <span id="s598">It just occurs to me that the atmosphere between 1940, I was only there from 1940 to 1943 was one of constant interference with people's lives.</span> <span id="s599">You couldn't just go to school and learn, you had to learn what they said was okay.</span> <span id="s600">You couldn't just sit in a street car because maybe there was a Wehrmacht, or a general or whatever.</span> <span id="s601">Maybe there was a razzia on the street and they were rounding up people to go to work camps or Jews to go to whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">02:06:01 There was always something going on which had to do with the occupation.</span> <span id="s603">I cannot differentiate occupation from personal persecution because I didn't suffer really any personal persecution, never.</span> <span id="s604">I was very lucky.</span> <span id="s605">I wasn't dragged by my hair.</span> <span id="s606">I wasn't tortured.</span> <span id="s607">I wasn't threatened except once during the first interrogation in the prison.</span> <span id="s608">That was no fun, but they said, “If you don't tell us where you have those papers from,” I had false papers, I said, “We're going to stick you in the water until you talk.”</span> <span id="s609">I said, “ Then I can't talk.”</span> <span id="s610">I mean to give you examples.</span> <span id="s611">I have had situations where personal chutzpah has saved my life.</span> <span id="s612">One of them is I think in the diary.</span> <span id="s613">I walked in Bergen Belsen on a very hot July afternoon.</span> <span id="s614">We came back from work and I was working in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s615">I was working in the kitchen because not only could I eat, but I could steal for Paul and there was a can of pork meat.</span> <span id="s616">As a Jew you don't like pork meat but when you're hungry who cares.</span> <span id="s617">And I take the pork meat, the can and I turned it inside into my bra and I had work overalls and I walk through the gate where the SS is to count us, you know ,when we come back and I had no idea that there was a fat stain from here to there over my left bosom and the SS man says, “Was ist los?</span> <span id="s618">What's the matter with you?</span> <span id="s619">Ihnen geht wohl die Milch ab?</span> <span id="s620">You lose your milk?”</span> <span id="s621">I said yes, “That's what it is, can I please go quickly back to the barrack and wash myself because this is awful.”</span> <span id="s622">At the same time I had under my hair which was long and I had a net under it, a half of pound of margarine or butter.</span> <span id="s623">So, if they would have caught me -- I mean I was lucky.</span> <span id="s624">But you see, when the guy says, “We stick you in the water until you talk,” I said, “Then I can't talk.”</span> <span id="s625">I yelled right back and he also.</span> <span id="s626">I mean, I was lucky.</span> <span id="s627">But these are personal things and I was terribly afraid of torture, terribly afraid of pain, terribly afraid of it.</span> <span id="s628">But these are always things you hear or dream about and are scared -- still I’m terrified of certain things.</span> <span id="s629">But...</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q:Were you connected with any underground groups?</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A:Only an underground group who was making false identifications and this came through my non-Jewish family of Paul whose sister was married to a resistance fighter who was in prison and tortured and beaten and sent to Dachau and whatever, and we were involved with that group and we were lucky.</span> <span id="s632">Once again lucky.</span> <span id="s633">They found only my papers.</span> <span id="s634">They never found the one of Paul and that is the reason why I was arrested alone without Paul first and sent alone to prison and alone to Westerbork and my father pulled me out.</span> <span id="s635">And Paul was home.</span> <span id="s636">Again, sheer luck.</span> <span id="s637">His false papers were a little further under the floor boards and of course they wanted to know whether I knew anything.</span> <span id="s638">I didn't know anything about it.</span> <span id="s639">I didn't know where they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q:Where did they find these papers, at Paul's sister's?</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A:They found them in Paul's sister's husband's hide out.</span> <span id="s642">He was already wanted because he had been a director of the music conservatory and he was a famous young guy and he was a resistance fighter and, somehow there was...there were traitors that had betrayed him.</span> <span id="s643">They found whatever his hideout and they found under the floorboards, false i.d. cards.</span> <span id="s644">I mean proof of identity which were fake and which, of course, were given to Jews and to people who were fleeing to England.</span> <span id="s645">There was always going something on in Holland.</span> <span id="s646">People are still trying to get to France and to Spain and to England and so on.</span> <span id="s647">So, they found us.</span> <span id="s648">And they had me with a picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">02:10:55</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q:So they came after you?</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A:They came after me.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q:How did they find you and where did they find you?</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A:They found me in the apartment we had rented very close to my parent's home and they came in and they were Dutch.</span> <span id="s654">They were not Germans.</span> <span id="s655">They were the Dutch police.</span> <span id="s656">This is what I remember and they said, “We have a warrant for your arrest.”</span> <span id="s657">I said, “What for?”</span> <span id="s658">They said “You'll find out when we take you to our jail.”</span> <span id="s659">So, I told myself, “Dutch jail, that's not too bad.</span> <span id="s660">That's not Gestapo.”</span> <span id="s661">Dutch jail was under the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s662">I found out why there were Germans.</span> <span id="s663">And then they more or less -- I don't remember the thing because I've repressed this whole thing so much.</span> <span id="s664">They confronted me with the fact that they had my papers and of course I was going to a concentration camp, if not worse, you know, whatever they threatened and I ended up in jail and I ended up in jail with -- a Dutch jail -- with about six women in a one person cell.</span> <span id="s665">I only remember the smell, the closeness, and the fear.</span> <span id="s666">And I don't know how many days but the whole thing lasted about ten days and then I was shipped to a Dutch concentration camp in the South of Holland and I had a stamp on my i.d. card, which was not a regular...which says S, which means Straf Fall, so I was a punishment case.</span> <span id="s667">This is how I was delivered into Vught and Vught would transmit me to Westerbork and Westerbork would transport me eventually to the east.</span> <span id="s668">We didn't know anything.</span> <span id="s669">This was 1943.</span> <span id="s670">I was, I think, four weeks in Vught.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q:What was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A:Vught was the name.</span> <span id="s673">V-U-G-H-T.</span> <span id="s674">Vught was the name.</span> <span id="s675">It's a concentration camp in Breda, near Brabant, Dutch.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">02:13:23 Then shipped in a train to Westerbork and then in Westerbork I was freed in July.</span> <span id="s677">So it was from February to July.</span> <span id="s678">And in Westerbork I got pulled by connections.</span> <span id="s679">I don't know how anymore, how exactly out of this so called S barracks, where they would take the people and ship them without any further procedures into the freight cars which were standing every Tuesday and every Friday in Westerbork chugging along to the east.</span> <span id="s680">That's it.</span> <span id="s681">Then I came back and from July until November 1943, Paul and I lived with all the restrictions in Amsterdam and then there was...</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q:Can I interrupt?</span> <span id="s683">What were those few months like?</span> <span id="s684">February to July is not just -- it's not even one month.</span> <span id="s685">It's not two months.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A:It’s three months...somehow I forget whether it’s...Eighteenth of February to -- almost five months.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q:Did you work there?</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A:I worked every where.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q:What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A:I worked everywhere.</span> <span id="s691">Wherever...I always used my languages.</span> <span id="s692">I worked either as an, I don’t know, interpreter or as a secretary always trying to do something to do with what I could write down things.</span> <span id="s693">I always found a job.</span> <span id="s694">Or in Bergen-Belsen, in the kitchen to get food, or wherever.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q:What was it like in Westerbork then?</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A:Westerbork was a camp like a kind of internment camp in a very bad physical situation because it was built on sand and mud.</span> <span id="s697">That was a good lesson before you got to Germany, horrible climate and run by Dutch under Germans and with still a lot of freedom.</span> <span id="s698">You could still do all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s699">You could write.</span> <span id="s700">You could get packages.</span> <span id="s701">There was music.</span> <span id="s702">There was theater.</span> <span id="s703">There were all kinds of things in Westerbork and always still the hope that you were still in your own country that one of these days it would end and you would be home.</span> <span id="s704">You were only let's say as far as Boston from Washington, if that far.</span> <span id="s705">It's a small country.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">02:16:09</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q:But you were there at the time that the transports were leaving every Tuesday?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A:Yah.</span> <span id="s709">Tuesday and Friday, I think twice a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Q:So, that must have been a very difficult situation in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A:Yes, but we didn't know what they were leaving for.</span> <span id="s712">They were leaving very often, very optimistic because they were going to work.</span> <span id="s713">There were no transports yet of old people, sick people.</span> <span id="s714">No, nothing.</span> <span id="s715">This was also, if I remember it well, I have to be careful now because I'm beginning to wonder whether I know it from what I read or what I really went through.</span> <span id="s716">To my mind, ‘til July 1943, there were no transportation yet of the people from mental institutions or the old people or -- there were always Straf transports, which is punishment and we wondered what happened to those people.</span> <span id="s717">Because we didn't know whether these guys were put to work let's say in the "mines" in Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s718">We knew that Mauthausen was very bad.</span> <span id="s719">We knew about that.</span> <span id="s720">We knew about the mines.</span> <span id="s721">We knew about the chemical factories in Germany.</span> <span id="s722">We knew a little about Poland.</span> <span id="s723">We knew mainly about Germany.</span> <span id="s724">Don't forget concentration camps were in Germany.</span> <span id="s725">Something which I also found out with the dissertation, no real, what do you call it, annihilation, last solution with gas was in Germany.</span> <span id="s726">They're all in Poland.</span> <span id="s727">Not in Austria, not in Germany.</span> <span id="s728">They were built east of where I was born, in Silesia.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">02:18:14 I always wonder why.</span> <span id="s730">Did they really think it would make the difference.</span> <span id="s731">They would get points.</span> <span id="s732">It's interesting.</span> <span id="s733">Anyway, where were we?</span> <span id="s734">The five months.</span> <span id="s735">Somewhere if I can improvise, there was nothing quite as bad as the fear of being arrested.</span> <span id="s736">Once you were arrested, you were rolling with the punches.</span> <span id="s737">Because what you imagine is all from my experiences is almost worse, you can't imagine things which happened later on.</span> <span id="s738">I didn't know I would live among the dead and the sick and the hungry.</span> <span id="s739">I didn't know what hunger was.</span> <span id="s740">I didn't know what dehumanization was.</span> <span id="s741">I didn't know.</span> <span id="s742">You can't imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q:Since you didn't go to Westerbork with Paul --?</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A:Yes, I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q:No, no, the first time.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A:The second time, we went.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q:Yes, the second time you were but the first time --?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A:To me this was old hat.</span> <span id="s749">I said it isn't so bad and it wasn't bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q:But the first time, did you make friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A:Yes, I immediately made friends and friends who later on were sent on.</span> <span id="s752">When I had left I know that they were -- they never came back.</span> <span id="s753">They disappeared.</span> <span id="s754">And I don't know if they went to Birkenau or Auschwitz or wherever they went.</span> <span id="s755">Of course I made friends.</span> <span id="s756">But again this is all like a dark hole.</span> <span id="s757">I don't remember names.</span> <span id="s758">I don't remember faces.</span> <span id="s759">I only know of certain circumstances.</span> <span id="s760">I think the whole thing about the camps to me is everything I wrote in Bergen-Belsen are facts.</span> <span id="s761">Everything I did before and after are part of a mechanism where I somewhere struggled to stay above it, not get involved again.</span> <span id="s762">Talking about friends, talking about family, talking about pain or illness, about whatever, but I can tell you one thing, it all came back.</span> <span id="s763">Under anesthesia and when I had cancer and I was at Sloan-Kettering, 1992, they find colon cancer, invasion of the lymph nodes, chemotherapy, the works at Sloan-Kettering.</span> <span id="s764">I'm again dreaming and fighting being strapped, being tethered to a certain thing -- my fight with the chemotherapist that I had to be once a week at Sloan-Kettering for a year.</span> <span id="s765">After five months they stopped it because I had too many side effects.</span> <span id="s766">But I tell you, this is something that goes so deep that I fight anytime when I need anesthesia whatever, even at the dentist.</span> <span id="s767">Since the war, I will not go under unless they absolutely hit me.</span> <span id="s768">Because I'm out of control.</span> <span id="s769">I need control to survive.</span> <span id="s770">And that goes very deep because if you ask me about friends, love, decency, everything stops because I went through so much which I didn't like what I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">02:22:41 Among other things I ate Paul's bread, Paul's ration.</span> <span id="s772">The guy was six foot three and I'm just a little person in comparison and I ate his bread and I did things which are not -- it's sheer survival.</span> <span id="s773">One thing I never done and I'm very proud of it, I've never done any prostitution.</span> <span id="s774">I had occasion, but I didn't do it.</span> <span id="s775">Not because of moral thing, because I told myself that's stupid.</span> <span id="s776">Because you do it with one you have to do , it with a couple of other people.</span> <span id="s777">So, I have no moral convictions and I came out totally an amoral person.</span> <span id="s778">It went so far that Paul said in 1945 when we were back home, that he said, “You've got to see a psychiatrist because you are totally demoralized.</span> <span id="s779">You don't know anymore what is right or wrong.</span> <span id="s780">You pick up anything you like because you think they owe it to you.</span> <span id="s781">Whether it's an ashtray or a cigarette or a piece of meat or a piece of whatever, you steal, you organize.</span> <span id="s782">You have no values.</span> <span id="s783">You have no respect for anything.”</span> <span id="s784">I went into therapy.</span> <span id="s785">It took about six months and then he said to me, "Renata, you can do it yourself."</span> <span id="s786">I said, “Who's paying whom anyway?”</span> <span id="s787">But whatever, I learned.</span> <span id="s788">I learned because if you live in a normal life where not everything is topsy turvy you better adjust because otherwise you can't survive.</span> <span id="s789">So, I survived the other way.</span> <span id="s790">But I'm very bitter.</span> <span id="s791">I'm very bitter about things and especially when people complain and when people say, “Oh, but if Hitler wouldn't have been there and if this and this and this wouldn't have happened and if I wouldn't have come to America and maybe I should have done this...” I say, ”It's all up to you.</span> <span id="s792">Don't blame anybody.</span> <span id="s793">You came through anything.</span> <span id="s794">The only people you have to live with eventually is you.</span> <span id="s795">If you can look into the mirror in the morning and say it's okay, I'm neither criminal nor an addict nor a this or a that, it's fine.”</span></p> <p><span id="s796">02:25:30 But what you do under I would say the ultimate circumstance of either being dead or alive, I have no judgment and no prejudice about that.</span> <span id="s797">I can understand that.</span> <span id="s798">I'm always afraid of torture in the sense that if I've been I would do anything and I wouldn't blame anybody who has betrayed a secret or an organization or anything.</span> <span id="s799">Do you understand what I'm talking about?</span> <span id="s800">What I'm so worried about is I'm put in a position where I have to make a real decision what will happen to somebody else.</span> <span id="s801">Let's say a situation where you know that your husband or your child or your father or your mother or your friend is being tortured or beaten and that you could save them but you know damn well you can't save them because they beat them anyway and they will kill you too.</span> <span id="s802">Joan, I don't like this digging into the past.</span> <span id="s803">People have very often said to me, “ Renata, why are you doing this?</span> <span id="s804">Why are you going to Germany.</span> <span id="s805">Why do you go now to the Holocaust Museum and give them an interview?</span> <span id="s806">Haven't you been through enough?</span> <span id="s807">Why do you have to do it at all?”</span> <span id="s808">I said, “God knows somebody else can learn something.”</span> <span id="s809">If you ask me one question, I'm asking you as if I were you.</span> <span id="s810">Would you do anything different than what I did.</span> <span id="s811">I would say “Yes.”</span> <span id="s812">I would not have stayed in Holland.</span> <span id="s813">I would have accepted an invitation in 1939 to go to Berkeley.</span> <span id="s814">I had a friend who wanted me to go to Berkeley and who knows?</span> <span id="s815">But otherwise, I might not write another diary although I still write diaries today.</span> <span id="s816">I can't do anything unless I write it down.</span> <span id="s817">I really am like the person who says I haven't lived anything until I have written it down.</span> <span id="s818">Because then you objectify.</span> <span id="s819">You're kind of above it, not any more in it.</span> <span id="s820">I never write in Bergen-Belsen in order to sit 52 years later in Washington and talk about things because I didn't think it would ever be read by anybody, not even by me.</span> <span id="s821">It was my survival mechanism if I write about it, I objectify.</span> <span id="s822">I rise above it because other people were drawing or reciting poetry or thinking about food or thinking about the past.</span> <span id="s823">This is where we are different from animals, I think.</span> <span id="s824">We have a brain.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">02:29:39</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Q:Were you writing diaries as a child?</span> <span id="s827">Were you always writing diaries?</span></p> <p><span id="s828">A:No, I was never writing diaries.</span> <span id="s829">Never.</span> <span id="s830">I only started in the concentration camp, that occurs to me.</span> <span id="s831">I had written stories.</span> <span id="s832">I always wrote, I wrote for magazines and things like that.</span> <span id="s833">I usually wrote what I call women’s stories, but --.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Q:Did you do that during the war before you were picked up?</span></p> <p><span id="s835">A:Yes, right, I always wrote, but not diaries.</span> <span id="s836">I never made notes.</span> <span id="s837">It was the writing mechanism.</span> <span id="s838">The mere fact that you try to do something which describes it so that it's not you but it.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q:But you didn't do it in Westerbork?</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A:No.</span> <span id="s841">Typical.</span> <span id="s842">It may not...It never occurred to me why didn't I do it in Westerbork.</span> <span id="s843">It would have been much easier.</span> <span id="s844">I didn't do it in Vught either.</span> <span id="s845">I only started it on the day we get to Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s846">I think I know why.</span> <span id="s847">Because it was foreign.</span> <span id="s848">I was in Germany.</span> <span id="s849">I wasn't home anymore.</span> <span id="s850">That may have been the idea.</span> <span id="s851">I always write travel notes when I travel.</span> <span id="s852">I never write when I’m home.</span> <span id="s853">Only when I travel.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">Q:Quite a trip!</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s856">-- that's interesting.</span> <span id="s857">Jesus, it never occurred to me that I only wrote because it was a trip.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Q:Can I ask you when you got out of Westerbork the first time, your father got you out?</span></p> <p><span id="s859">A:I guess so.</span> <span id="s860">Father and friends.</span> <span id="s861">He went to the Hague and I had a German friend, I had a German friend who knew people in the Hague who were not Gestapo who were army and somehow that did work.</span> <span id="s862">It was a connection business.</span> <span id="s863">Again PR.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q:Now you said when you got out you told your father you and Paul really wanted to go underground.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">A:I didn't say it the same day I came home, but during the month we were home.</span> <span id="s866">I said, "I think things are getting very tough, and I don't want to want to get back into Westerbork."</span> <span id="s867">I never mentioned the idea of being shipped, because we didn't know.</span> <span id="s868">We really didn't know.</span> <span id="s869">But I wanted to go under.</span> <span id="s870">I wanted to possibly try to get to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s871">You know the illegal route.</span> <span id="s872">And of course Paul's brother was arrested and was killed on his way to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s873">And other people in the family tried it and got killed.</span> <span id="s874">They never came back.</span> <span id="s875">I mean they tried to get to Belgium or wherever and they were killed.</span> <span id="s876">Some people made it to England but much much later or earlier.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">02:32:22</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q.</span> <span id="s879">So you decided to pay attention to what your father was saying and not go underground?</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A:Yes, we decided, we were set, “But then you bring me into danger.</span> <span id="s881">Because if you guys disappear the Germans will wonder where you are because you're part of my, my reservation.”</span> <span id="s882">Reserved until further notice.</span> <span id="s883">Reserved from persecution.</span> <span id="s884">Preserved, reserved you name it.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">Q:So what did you do between July and November?</span></p> <p><span id="s886">A:I don't know what I did.</span> <span id="s887">I suppose we tried to buy things on the black market and survive the best we could and listen to the BBC.</span> <span id="s888">What do people do normally?</span> <span id="s889">I don't know.</span> <span id="s890">It would have been very interesting if Paul...and I want you to get to Paul in Germany.</span> <span id="s891">I have the address and the phone number.</span> <span id="s892">I want somebody from the Holocaust Museum to go to him and have him talk.</span> <span id="s893">Because he helped me in Germany when Martina and I were doing this book he met with her and he stayed with us.</span> <span id="s894">And he said, "My God, you have this all wrong.</span> <span id="s895">This wasn't this way or this wasn't that way."</span> <span id="s896">And he's very much into it.</span> <span id="s897">So let's see.</span> <span id="s898">You can ask him.</span> <span id="s899">Are you ever going to Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Q:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">A:You ever going to Germany?</span> <span id="s902">Have you been?</span></p> <p><span id="s903">Q:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">A:Where?</span> <span id="s905">Frankfurt?</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q:Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">A:Berlin, I have been to Berlin too.</span> <span id="s908">Have you ever been to any of the KZ places like Bergen-Belsen, Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">Q:Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">A:You have not been in Bergen-Belsen?</span> <span id="s911">You should go there.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">Q:O.</span> <span id="s913">K.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">A:And go to Dachau, Munich.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">02:33:55</span></p> <p><span id="s916">Q:Tell me why the two of you were picked up the second time.</span> <span id="s917">Do you know why?</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A:The second time we were picked up, because it was a general tightening up on people in November in 1943.</span> <span id="s919">They were beginning to round up people and begin to ship them via Westerbork to the east.</span> <span id="s920">I don't know why we were picked up.</span> <span id="s921">I only know that they came in and say, "You go to the Municipal Theater."</span> <span id="s922">That is the gathering point and then we, you go to Westerbork.</span> <span id="s923">And then in Westerbork we were supposed to stay.</span> <span id="s924">Because we again had the right kind of papers.</span> <span id="s925">And then in Westerbork we got the notice.</span> <span id="s926">That we were going to Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s927">We were in Westerbork from my birthday November 3 until the 15th of March 1944 and then we were told in Westerbork that we were going to Bergen-Belsen which was a so called preferential camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Again, through the connections of my dad because we were not being sent east.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q:Were you able to be in communication with your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A:In Westerbork?</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A:No.</span> <span id="s933">I mean we could write a letter but it would take weeks.</span> <span id="s934">Yes, we were in communication and we were not in communication but not like picking up a phone or sending a postcard, but there was some connection.</span> <span id="s935">We knew more or less that they were alive and they knew that we were doing okay.</span> <span id="s936">We could also get parcels.</span> <span id="s937">We could also get parcels in Bergen-Belsen for a while.</span> <span id="s938">That came through the Red Cross and that came again through connections in Sweden and whatever connections one had.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q:Did both of you work when you were in Westerbork also at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A:I don't know.</span> <span id="s941">I think so.</span> <span id="s942">I think...I definitely worked in some administrative job and I don't know what Paul did.</span> <span id="s943">I don't know.</span> <span id="s944">He was still in good shape and I think he may have worked even in speech therapy, because wherever he worked he tried to do his professional thing.</span> <span id="s945">Even in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s946">People do what they are.</span> <span id="s947">So, but not officially.</span> <span id="s948">I mean, you don't get a job and you don't get a pay check.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">02:36:39</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q:Before you leave for Bergen-Belsen, do you feel yourself changing, your character changing?</span> <span id="s951">Do you feel yourself getting depressed or angry?</span> <span id="s952">Or...</span></p> <p><span id="s953">A:Before I leave for Bergen-Belsen?</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Q:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">A:I thought I was still very, very angry that we were going to Germany.</span> <span id="s956">Depressed, I can't remember depression until much, much later in life.</span> <span id="s957">No, depression is not the word but angry, yes.</span> <span id="s958">Angry and kind of feeling the “victim” that I'm being shipped like a parcel.</span> <span id="s959">The impersonal aspects of something.</span> <span id="s960">Later on in life I learned in America that this is where we are going here.</span> <span id="s961">The impersonal -- I worked in a big cancer center and the impersonal dealing with government.</span> <span id="s962">And the people can't do anything.</span> <span id="s963">You're helpless.</span> <span id="s964">You're being managed.</span> <span id="s965">Managed care.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Q:Paul said to you much later that you were amoral, that you became amoral?</span></p> <p><span id="s967">A:Yes, my second husband said, “You're a monster,” and I had been in psychotherapy and Paul said, “You're amoral.</span> <span id="s968">You can't survive this way.</span> <span id="s969">You must learn manners.</span> <span id="s970">That's not the point.</span> <span id="s971">You must learn you can't do certain things.</span> <span id="s972">There are the ten commandments.</span> <span id="s973">The only thing you don't do is kill.</span> <span id="s974">Otherwise you steal, you --.”</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q:It's interesting the way you describe yourself because you come from a certain way a very privileged home.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A:Very.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">Q:Though Bohemian, nevertheless very privileged.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">A:Privileged in many ways that I had all kinds of things which were given to me as a child, background, education, appreciation, diversity.</span> <span id="s979">I was never bored.</span> <span id="s980">Never.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">02:39:13</span></p> <p><span id="s982">Q:Do you think that gave you strength when these things started happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s983">A:I think that this is a terribly important thing.</span> <span id="s984">I call this “vitamins”.</span> <span id="s985">If you had a childhood with vitamins of diversity, you will never ever lose that because you will always play games.</span> <span id="s986">You will always fantasize.</span> <span id="s987">You will do something.</span> <span id="s988">It's very interesting.</span> <span id="s989">One of the titles of the diaries from Dachau is Imagination as Weapon.</span> <span id="s990">So, in other words, I had a very imaginative, imaginative surrounding and imaginative childhood and parents and brothers and sisters who were serious but also playing with life.</span> <span id="s991">There were very few rules and very few restrictions and as soon as the restrictions begin I get angry and I protest.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">Still, I think at age 76 I should have learned to keep my mouth shut and to behave.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">Q:Can I ask you whether you know why Westerbork in someway is vague to you in your memory?</span></p> <p><span id="s994">A:Why is it vague?</span> <span id="s995">I'm trying to think.</span> <span id="s996">The first answer is always what you should say.</span> <span id="s997">The first answer was that it was so messy.</span> <span id="s998">It was so disorganized.</span> <span id="s999">There was nothing.</span> <span id="s1000">It was not final.</span> <span id="s1001">I think it has something to do with the fact that it was so close to the border with Germany physically.</span> <span id="s1002">It was a transit camp, transit to what...Transit forward, backwards, back home.</span> <span id="s1003">I had been there once and had gotten out.</span> <span id="s1004">I felt in Westerbork that it was a kind of a continuation of the kind of...Bohemian is not the word.</span> <span id="s1005">I don't know how to say it.</span> <span id="s1006">It was still not really restrictive.</span> <span id="s1007">Yes, of course there were guards and there was barbed wire but very far away.</span> <span id="s1008">It wasn't right -- the guards were not all over the place like in Bergen-Belsen or in the concentration camp inVught.</span> <span id="s1009">It was kind of a family interment camp.</span> <span id="s1010">I think why I remember so little is that what came afterwards left its mark much more.</span> <span id="s1011">And don't forget, physically what I have been through since Westerbork, typhus, encephalitis, you name it I've had it.</span> <span id="s1012">The cancer hasn't helped, especially the chemotherapy, but that's over now.</span> <span id="s1013">I see my surgeon Friday.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">02:43:17</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">Q:Tell me about your preparations to go Bergen-Belsen and the trip?</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A:The first time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q:No, Bergen-Belsen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">A:You're talking 1943 or 1985?</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">Q:No, 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">A:My preparation?</span> <span id="s1021">There was no preparation.</span> <span id="s1022">I mean I can't -- maybe Paul remembers it.</span> <span id="s1023">I don't.</span> <span id="s1024">I don't remember whether there was any preparation of what to take.</span> <span id="s1025">You took everything you had.</span> <span id="s1026">You had a suitcase.</span> <span id="s1027">You stuffed everything in it.</span> <span id="s1028">I remember my preparation for jail.</span> <span id="s1029">That I'll never forget.</span> <span id="s1030">On the 18th of February... Again, because it's very personal.</span> <span id="s1031">On the 18th of February they ring the bell in the evening.</span> <span id="s1032">It must have been eight, ten o’clock, between eight and ten in the evening.</span> <span id="s1033">I had no idea.</span> <span id="s1034">They are the Dutch police and they say, “We have a warrant for your arrest.</span> <span id="s1035">You're going to jail.”</span> <span id="s1036">Now, it was right near the central part of Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s1037">I said what can I take?</span> <span id="s1038">He said you can take anything you want to for a few days.</span> <span id="s1039">I said to Paul, “I'm going to take toilet water and perfume.”</span> <span id="s1040">He said, “better take a sweater.”</span> <span id="s1041">I said, “I'll take a sweater.</span> <span id="s1042">I'll take my best sweater.</span> <span id="s1043">I'll take my best pants.</span> <span id="s1044">I'll take my toilet water and perfume.”</span> <span id="s1045">I was smoking at the time too.</span> <span id="s1046">I started only smoking when there were no cigarettes, but that's what I remember.</span> <span id="s1047">Now when you ask me what I did for Bergen-Belsen --</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">Q:Why did you think of taking perfume.</span> <span id="s1049">What were you thinking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">A:Preservation of my -- why did, in Bergen-Belsen, did the French women fight more for the lipstick than for their -- I don't know.</span> <span id="s1051">This is...It was the worst thing the people could do to you and I remember that in one of the camps where the women had long hair and they took away the comb which would hold up -- at that time everything was walled, remember, and they took it away.</span> <span id="s1052">They took the bras away and they took the combs away because they knew that the women would suffer from that.</span> <span id="s1053">Leave it to women.</span> <span id="s1054">So anyway, I don't know why I took my lipstick.</span> <span id="s1055">I don't know why I took perfume, but it was something that would remind me of the civilized world.</span> <span id="s1056">Let me give you another example.</span> <span id="s1057">When I had a test in English at NYU Professor Edel the James scholar, gave us a question, “What would you take if you were on an uninhabited island and if you know you would never come back, which book?”</span> <span id="s1058">Most people had either the Bible or Hamlet or whatever.</span> <span id="s1059">What did I have?</span> <span id="s1060">Madame Bovary.</span> <span id="s1061">So, Edel said , “why?”</span> <span id="s1062">I said, “The food, the clothes, the ambiance, the discussions, the love, the whole thing.</span> <span id="s1063">It's all so bourgeois and that I would miss.</span> <span id="s1064">So, why does anybody take whatever it is that's very personal?</span> <span id="s1065">Reaching back in order to stay on a certain level.</span> <span id="s1066">I don't think today I would take the toilet water, but I don't know.</span> <span id="s1067">I think I would take a thermometer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">02:47:16</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Q:Do you remember the trip to Bergen-Belsen, in '43?</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">A:Oh yes, very much so.</span> <span id="s1071">I remember this feeling of riding to Germany and I'm never going to come back.</span> <span id="s1072">Yes, we're going to come back.</span> <span id="s1073">I remember -- it's all in my diary.</span> <span id="s1074">I remembered that because that I immediately put down.</span> <span id="s1075">This feeling of going away into the unknown and certainly very unpleasant.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">Q:Did you take a notebook with you, a blank notebook?</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">A:That notebook is the one which is now in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s1078">I had a black school book, a black notebook like this and I had that with me and I had it with me and I don't know why I had it and I started writing.</span> <span id="s1079">I never wrote in Westerbork, I told you.</span> <span id="s1080">Never wrote.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">Q:What did you write with?</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">A:Pen, pencils.</span> <span id="s1083">Don't forget I always worked in administrative things.</span> <span id="s1084">I stole left and right.</span> <span id="s1085">Watch your pencils.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Q:Do you remember having a bunch of pens or pencils with you on this trip when you went?</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">A:No, certainly not more than two.</span> <span id="s1088">I didn't have a bunch of pencils.</span> <span id="s1089">I always found a pencil.</span> <span id="s1090">I steal them, find them.</span> <span id="s1091">That is really the euphemism for stealing, borrowing.</span> <span id="s1092">Mark Twain.</span> <span id="s1093">I don't know.</span> <span id="s1094">That was never a problem for me to find something to write with.</span> <span id="s1095">It was a problem -- it wasn't a problem to write.</span> <span id="s1096">It was a problem of tiredness, when do I do it, how do I do it, what do I risk?</span> <span id="s1097">Is it worth it?</span> <span id="s1098">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1099">I just did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Q:Is the diary a companion?</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">A:To me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">Q:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">A:No, I think it was like the perfume.</span> <span id="s1104">It was something very personal which gave you distance.</span> <span id="s1105">Distance from what's around you, what's happening.</span> <span id="s1106">It still is.</span> <span id="s1107">I write much better than I talk, but whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">Q:When did you usually write, at night before you went to sleep or did you just steal time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">A:Anytime when I had a moment when it was light enough, when it was quiet enough and I shared the diary with other people.</span> <span id="s1110">I read it to them, and I remember those Sunday afternoons when we're sitting with a back against the barrack wall and I wrote about what we had to eat and what we had done and whatever, and people kept saying, “Why do you write, it's dangerous.”</span> <span id="s1111">I said, “I'm not writing anything dangerous.</span> <span id="s1112">I'm writing what's happening.”</span> <span id="s1113">So, it became a kind of a -- and there were other people who wrote too and there were other people in other camps which were much more in danger than we were because if you were in a real, real concentration camp, like Ravensbrück or Dachau, if they found it you were dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">02:51:04</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">Q:Did you read very often from it to other people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">A:No.</span> <span id="s1117">I would say twice a month.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">Q:Did people find it entertaining?</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">A:Yah, because it reminded them of something that they had already forgotten.</span> <span id="s1120">They didn't remember this or they didn't remember that we had to stand on appell on that morning or this and this and that and that we had hoped we would get mail or not.</span> <span id="s1121">You know, you do this as a kind of recording mechanism, but I never ever wrote in the sense of J’Accuse, "I Accuse," I didn't think anyone would ever read it, find it, find it, read it, = publish it.</span> <span id="s1122">It never occurred to me.</span> <span id="s1123">I wrote for myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">Q:Did you change the names of people?</span> <span id="s1125">There are two names that are in there.</span> <span id="s1126">Paul's name is Paul.</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">A:I changed no names.</span> <span id="s1128">Hein is Hein and Lilo is Lilo and no names are changed and they mention very few names.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">Q:That was on purpose?</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">A:I had this feeling that being a writer you had to be very careful of whom you write and what you write about.</span> <span id="s1131">One of the people, when I tried to publish the diary, I went to a literary agent in New York and he's the agent of Norman Mailer and Gerald Greene, and he was involved with this whole Holocaust crap T.V. movie and he said, “Renata Laqueur, your diary is much to impersonal and not violent enough for publication.</span> <span id="s1132">Your dissertation is much too scholarly and who cares.</span> <span id="s1133">These are other people in the concentration camp,” and so on and I got a terrible critique.</span> <span id="s1134">That is what made me totally desist from anything and that happened long before the German guy found my diary in Germany.</span> <span id="s1135">That was between '65 and, I would say, '82.</span> <span id="s1136">And I never did anything about it more in America.</span> <span id="s1137">I said, “Go to hell.”</span> <span id="s1138">I spent 500 dollars and that's it.</span> <span id="s1139">Because what they want here is victims in Bloomingdale clothes.</span> <span id="s1140">That's about what they did when they made the T.V. movie from Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1141">Everybody looked much too good and forget it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">Q:In your diary you don't write about the structure of Bergen-Belsen about the --?</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">A:I don't write about that this camp is different from the tent camp and the Russian.</span> <span id="s1144">We didn't know anything about the Russians.</span> <span id="s1145">We didn't know about the prisoner of war.</span> <span id="s1146">No, I wasn't interested.</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">Q:So what part of the camp are you living in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">02:54:31</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">A:I was in the so-called Stern Lager, the one where they had the Jewish, what do you call it?</span> <span id="s1150">, privileged families from Holland.</span> <span id="s1151">Were there already any French or was that in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s1152">Are you talking Bergen-Belsen or Westerbork?</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">Q:Bergen-Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">A:There were people who brought their stuff in luggage or whatever they had with them and they kept it.</span> <span id="s1155">So, that was already very different from the people who were put into striped uniforms, Häftlinge.</span> <span id="s1156">So, we knew that our camp was a so called family -- the families stayed together.</span> <span id="s1157">Not in one barrack, but let's say Paul was in the male barrack and I was in the female barrack but at least the families could see each other.</span> <span id="s1158">They could communicate.</span> <span id="s1159">That was the difference with a real concentration camp for everybody where everybody was divided into political, into pure Jewish, into Catholic and to homosexuals and to whatever.</span> <span id="s1160">They had different kind of insignia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">Q:When you first arrived you decided you weren't going to work right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">A:I don't know, do I say that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">Q:Yes.</span> <span id="s1164">It only lasted a few days.</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">A:Of course, I said, “Why the hell would I work.”</span> <span id="s1166">You learn very fast what you should do in order to stay on top.</span> <span id="s1167">Whatever.</span> <span id="s1168">There was no immediate danger.</span> <span id="s1169">No, I decided I wanted to see what's going on before I decided to work and then of course I ended up in things which I didn't want to do.</span> <span id="s1170">Shoes, or cutting turnips in the kitchen, you know, whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">Q:What's your most vivid memory of that beginning in Bergen-Belsen?</span> <span id="s1172">Is there one particular one?</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">A:The most vivid memory of Bergen-Belsen is the difference between the outside nature and coming into the camp because it was March and Spring comes early in the north of Germany and the trees were beginning to get these beautiful film of light green.</span> <span id="s1174">And when you come into the camp there are these barracks which are dark, between dark green and brown and nothing but sand and mud and it started raining of course.</span> <span id="s1175">It always rains.</span> <span id="s1176">The first impression was freedom is trees and a camp is mud and a barrack.</span> <span id="s1177">And of course guards and dogs.</span> <span id="s1178">That's the first impression.</span> <span id="s1179">That was very different from Westerbork.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">02:57:43 An interesting thing, they put me in 1985 on the so called train Rampe, you know, the platform and filmed there and asked me, “What do you remember of this?”</span> <span id="s1181">And there were Canadians from the NATO at that time and we were eating ice cream and I said I don't remember eating ice cream at the entrance where the trains came in.</span> <span id="s1182">You know things like that.</span> <span id="s1183">It is unbelievable to come back in '85 after 40 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">Q:Let's take a break.</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">02:58:14</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">03:01:07</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">Q:Renata, early in your diary, March 20, you say, "I do not long anymore.</span> <span id="s1189">Everything seems so futile.</span> <span id="s1190">Desire is less important than food or clothes to be mended."</span> <span id="s1191">Then a few days later you wrote, "Life is senseless."</span> <span id="s1192">Do you remember what was going on when you said those things?</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">A:It's the first time that I -- as I told you before I don't see depression.</span> <span id="s1194">This sounds like depression.</span> <span id="s1195">This is the futility of...I can very well understand why I write this because I don't like the word "victim" because victim means that you have gotten yourself into a situation where you can't escape.</span> <span id="s1196">But this feeling of it doesn't make any sense.</span> <span id="s1197">Here I am in '43 I'm 23 years old at that point, and I'm only beginning to live and I'm somehow cut off from anything which I had hoped for and envisioned.</span> <span id="s1198">This reminds me a little bit of Anne Frank.</span> <span id="s1199">And Frank had these moments too in which she said, "It doesn't make any sense."</span> <span id="s1200">You have actually again we come to my favorite word "choice."</span> <span id="s1201">There are no choices.</span> <span id="s1202">The only choices I have at that point in Bergen-Belsen is to roll with the punches and try to come out.</span> <span id="s1203">I didn't know how bad it would get but the whole thing doesn't make any sense.</span> <span id="s1204">It's senseless and futile.</span> <span id="s1205">And we're wasting precious time, and I was brought up with a very puritanical idea of you don't waste time.</span> <span id="s1206">I think this goes through my whole life, always having a bad conscience if I just do what they call in Dutch “niksen”.</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">03:04:03 You don't do anything.</span> <span id="s1208">You're niks.</span> <span id="s1209">And here I was sitting in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s1210">Why?</span> <span id="s1211">What for?</span> <span id="s1212">How long?</span> <span id="s1213">What's time?</span> <span id="s1214">You will find this in all the diaries.</span> <span id="s1215">You'll find the feeling of the sense of time.</span> <span id="s1216">The urgency of time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">Q:And that you're losing it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">A:And losing it and losing it and losing it.</span> <span id="s1219">And the fear of losing it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">Q:Is it boring in a certain way because it's circular, it's the same thing every day in some respects?</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">A:Interesting.</span> <span id="s1222">First association when you say is boring, I said how can anything be boring which is so different from what you're used to?</span> <span id="s1223">That's already almost a travel expansion.</span> <span id="s1224">It is so different that it isn't boring, but then if it remains the same with the appell and the wake up calls and the harassment and the lack of this and the lack of that, it's up to you what you make out of it whether it remains the same, or whether you found ways to, to change it.</span> <span id="s1225">I don't know.</span> <span id="s1226">I don't think it's boring in the sense when we watch something on T.V..</span> <span id="s1227">and we say it's boring, it means we know it already.</span> <span id="s1228">There's nothing to learn.</span> <span id="s1229">There's nothing exciting about it so why put it on T.V. or in a paper or you read a story and you say it's boring.</span> <span id="s1230">I know it already.</span> <span id="s1231">Here I don't think it was ever boring, because you never knew what would happen from one minute to the next.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">Q:Was it then tedious?</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s1234">The absence of color, the tedium of always the same.</span> <span id="s1235">Tedious yes, but not boring.</span> <span id="s1236">That's quite a difference.</span> <span id="s1237">The absence of what you were used to or what you wanted, I want to say is painful, it's not true because if it's tedious it's not painful, it's just a drag.</span> <span id="s1238">It's terribly depressing and depressing means that you're being pushed down and under and in order to come out from down under and to be on top you have to find ways and means either organizing stuff or writing about it or doing something connected with the past, living in imagination but you have to come out of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">03:07:32</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">Q:Were you in some sense more imaginative than Paul in this situation?</span> <span id="s1241">You kept coming out and finding ways --.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">A:Women are always more imaginative.</span> <span id="s1243">No, No, I’m serious.</span> <span id="s1244">Was I?</span> <span id="s1245">No.</span> <span id="s1246">Paul is a different person.</span> <span id="s1247">Paul is not a recorder, an evaluator, an analytical person.</span> <span id="s1248">In many ways, Paul said often to me he had the best time he ever had in camp because it was less depressing than competing with the outside.</span> <span id="s1249">That is the real depressive.</span> <span id="s1250">I missed the competition.</span> <span id="s1251">I missed the excitement of having to make it.</span> <span id="s1252">He was happy because, he said, “The worst thing they can do to me is beat me,” and he once said to me, “When they beat me at least I was warm instead of freezing.”</span> <span id="s1253">So, he had a different approach, and this is why I want you to meet somebody like Paul.</span> <span id="s1254">You will hear the other side.</span> <span id="s1255">No.</span> <span id="s1256">I don't know.</span> <span id="s1257">It's very interesting when you say the differences.</span> <span id="s1258">He was also a better person because he cared more about what people felt and how they suffered.</span> <span id="s1259">I pushed that all away.</span> <span id="s1260">I didn't want to -- if I report about it I don't feel it.</span> <span id="s1261">So, you see this is where later on you are actually a monster.</span> <span id="s1262">Because he said, “You distantiate yourself from not being upset.”</span> <span id="s1263">Upset is not the word, but feeling aghast and feeling guilty by documenting it and using the writing like people very often use photography, you know, as a kind of a -- the instrument is between their own feeling and what they put on paper in a photograph or in writing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">03:10:14 I was also so much left out in that diary.</span> <span id="s1265">This is what the publisher said.</span> <span id="s1266">It is not personal.</span> <span id="s1267">Because then I would have whined and complained and I'm not a whiner and a complainer.</span> <span id="s1268">For that I'm too proud because then I get hit again if you whine.</span> <span id="s1269">I say somewhere in the diary, I say I think around the 15th of June, I said, "There's another one who keeps talking about the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1270">There's another whiner, another one who keeps telling us how awful it was.</span> <span id="s1271">Who wants to hear about it."</span> <span id="s1272">I already felt that while I was in it so I wasn't about to whine.</span> <span id="s1273">Not even to myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">Q:Now at another point in the diary you say noone talked about homesickness but inside I hurt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">A:Of course.</span> <span id="s1276">I do.</span> <span id="s1277">Of course, of course, you're homesick.</span> <span id="s1278">I mean, I keep saying that I can smell the leather couch or can see this or that or this enormous desire for flowers, for beauty for air for sea, for cleanliness, for all the things we take for granted.</span> <span id="s1279">I tell you yesterday I arrive at the Mayflower and the first thing I did is ask the guy who helped me open the window a little bit or whatever I said, “Can I drink the water?”</span> <span id="s1280">He said, ”I don't drink it.”</span> <span id="s1281">I said, “Jesus,” to myself, “am I in Leningrad, St. Petersburg or am I in Washington DC?”</span> <span id="s1282">So, I called the front desk and I said, “Can I drink the water?”</span> <span id="s1283">He said, “I drink it.”</span> <span id="s1284">These are the things we take so for granted that we have everything.</span> <span id="s1285">We have food, we have water, we have this.</span> <span id="s1286">We have cleanliness.</span> <span id="s1287">We don't have lice.</span> <span id="s1288">We don't die of this or that of dysentery or whatever and that is exciting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">Q:You're always looking for a quiet place?</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">A:Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">Q:You love sitting outside at Bergen-Belsen, right?</span> <span id="s1292">Maybe you'll get a moment when you're not smelling the stench or you’re not hearing the noise?</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">A:I've always liked quiet places.</span> <span id="s1294">That's right, because how can you concentrate when there is bedlam all around you.</span> <span id="s1295">And especially that early time in Bergen-Belsen, it was just being with other people, just an inconvenience but it doesn't become a torture until it becomes so bad that you don't know how to defend yourself against one more exertion because you're so weak.</span> <span id="s1296">I don't know.</span> <span id="s1297">I don't know how I survived.</span> <span id="s1298">I only know that I couldn't do it again.</span> <span id="s1299">And that's now true either because when I got into situations later in life, and in the last four years, people said, “I don't know how you can do this.”</span> <span id="s1300">Get up and walk to chemotherapy and walk back to chemotherapy and these winters that we've had '93 and '94 and '95 and so on, and not taking morphine and whatever, I just can't do it any other way because I'm still the surviving rat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">03:14:35 So, it becomes kind of a bad habit.</span> <span id="s1302">No, I'm very serious about this because it also implies that you have practically, as the French say “égards,” no regard, no consideration at all for anybody else.</span> <span id="s1303">When I got the cancer diagnosis and the operation at Sloan Kettering, it was Christmas and my sister wanted to come and my other family wanted to come, I said, “Nobody comes until I am ready to see you guys.”</span> <span id="s1304">This goes back to the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1305">I cannot share misery.</span> <span id="s1306">I have to be alone.</span> <span id="s1307">It has to be quiet and especially the sicker I am and the more in pain I am the more alone I want to be.</span> <span id="s1308">Just like a dog.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">Q:But you can't be alone in Bergen-Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">A:You can never be alone, but on the other hand you can retire into yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">Q:Is that why you don't talk about other people?</span> <span id="s1312">Almost no one else is mentioned in the diary.</span> <span id="s1313">You mention some people, but you don't mention people close to you in Bergen-Belsen except Paul.</span> <span id="s1314">Is that because there isn't anybody or is that because you don't want somehow to speak about them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">A:I don't want to talk at all.</span> <span id="s1316">I don't want to get involved.</span> <span id="s1317">I have enough to survive myself with out getting all their life stories meshed into mine.</span> <span id="s1318">Of course I listened.</span> <span id="s1319">Of course I knew people, but I don't remember the facts of anybody.</span> <span id="s1320">I have repressed it so much that people very often asked me, “Did you meet such and such.</span> <span id="s1321">But you were together in one barrack.”</span> <span id="s1322">And I said, “I have not the vaguest idea of who she or he is.”</span> <span id="s1323">Paul has asked me questions when I met him.</span> <span id="s1324">He said, “Don't you remember this?”</span> <span id="s1325">I said, “I have not the vaguest idea of what you're talking about.</span> <span id="s1326">You can give me the third degree.</span> <span id="s1327">You can torture me.</span> <span id="s1328">I have nothing to give.”</span> <span id="s1329">He said, “Where is it?”</span> <span id="s1330">I said, ”I don't know.</span> <span id="s1331">Gone.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">Q:But you do remember that you listened to people or you talked with people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">A:I have always been interested in what people tell me, but I didn't --</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">Q:Record it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">A:Didn’t record it, didn't want to get involved in the sense of...You see I almost rarely talk in the diary about what I really feel.</span> <span id="s1336">There’s very little hope in the diary.</span> <span id="s1337">From are we ever going to get liberated.</span> <span id="s1338">You know, you find this because I don't remember anymore whether I believe, really believed that we ever would get liberated.</span> <span id="s1339">I don't think I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">03:17:32</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">Q:Especially towards the end you say --</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">A:I think this is again...This is a very simple physiological explanation.</span> <span id="s1343">I still have it today.</span> <span id="s1344">I have to get something to eat.</span> <span id="s1345">I don't care what it is, but I get these attacks of...If I get hungry I go wild.</span> <span id="s1346">Standing in line in a cafeteria I always have something with me, candy, you saw I ate one or two bites of the dessert because I needed it.</span> <span id="s1347">I needed the sugar.</span> <span id="s1348">I have no hypoglycemia.</span> <span id="s1349">I've been going into that, but I need somewhere not to have to want and not get it.</span> <span id="s1350">Then I go crazy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">Q:Can you talk about food in Bergen-Belsen, because in the diary you talk about spinach.</span> <span id="s1352">You talk about spaghetti--</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">A:Everybody else talked recipes all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">Q:Did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">A:No.</span> <span id="s1356">I wasn't a recipe person.</span> <span id="s1357">No, I didn't.</span> <span id="s1358">But I'm just thinking back one of the diaries says I read cook books like I used to read pornography and I must tell you, this is very nice.</span> <span id="s1359">I don't remember whether I talked recipe.</span> <span id="s1360">I'm sure that I talked, yes, also about white bread and chocolate and things we got especially as children.</span> <span id="s1361">You always go back to your childhood.</span> <span id="s1362">I'm sure that I dreamt about chocolate, and I taught myself not to like chocolate because it's bad for you.</span> <span id="s1363">So.</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">Q:What was the food like?</span> <span id="s1365">You had trouble with turnips?</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">A:I had trouble with the turnips because the turnips go into your gall bladder.</span> <span id="s1367">Turnips are bad.</span> <span id="s1368">Food was...Food was food.</span> <span id="s1369">If you had it, you ate it.</span> <span id="s1370">There were some people who were really heroic.</span> <span id="s1371">I remember there was a rabbi who wouldn't eat a piece of meat because he wasn't sure that it wasn't pork and he was dying of hunger.</span> <span id="s1372">That is principle.</span> <span id="s1373">I admire that, and I was angry at the same time.</span> <span id="s1374">I said, “Then give it to Paul or give it to me.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">Q:Did you tell him that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s1377">He didn't give it.</span> <span id="s1378">I think he didn't give it.</span> <span id="s1379">He must have said something, “If you're a good Jew you don't eat it,” and I must have said, ”I'm not a good Jew, I want the pork.”</span> <span id="s1380">I don't know but there were altercations about this.</span> <span id="s1381">Paul knows these things.</span> <span id="s1382">He told me when I met him he said, “Do you remember the guy who didn't want to eat his meat?”</span> <span id="s1383">I said, “Yes.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">Q:That you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">A:That I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">Q:Do you remember working in the kitchen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">A:Oh, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1388">That I even remember the smell.</span> <span id="s1389">I remember this enormous big vats with something boiling hot.</span> <span id="s1390">It was either soup or some thing with a vegetable in it and always seeing whether there was any meat or a piece in it which you could eat like a potato or a piece of meat or a whole carrot and working in the kitchen meant getting up before day and dawn at three a.m. and being there until four in the afternoon or five in the afternoon and then taking something home, back to the barrack, and it wasn't always as dramatic as with the pork or the hair or whatever, but I gained weight and I could give Paul things and that was important.</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">03:21:05</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">Q:But it was difficult for you to work there.</span> <span id="s1393">You worked there for about three weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">A:So difficult that I had to give it up because I didn't get any sleep because I was too excited and too, you know, hepped up about getting to the kitchen and the whole tension of whether I'd be able to take food out.</span> <span id="s1395">I think I got very scared after that episode.</span> <span id="s1396">If I remember it right, it was too tiring and I told myself it isn't worth it.</span> <span id="s1397">It's going to kill me, so I gave it up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">Q:Now, I would imagine people might be surprised that you decide to switch jobs?</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">A:I didn't switch jobs.</span> <span id="s1400">I just gave it up.</span> <span id="s1401">I didn't switch jobs.</span> <span id="s1402">I didn't go to an unemployment office and I didn't put a resume in and say, “I can do this.”</span> <span id="s1403">No, but there were some other things that I could do and I don't know what it is but this was July 1944.</span> <span id="s1404">It depended on the circumstances.</span> <span id="s1405">In 1944 in September the barracks got more crowded, because people were being pushed with the Russian advance and Auschwitz being emptied, beginning to be emptied, and Birkenau and all these people came west and there was less work and less food and finally we didn't do anything anymore.</span> <span id="s1406">We vegetated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">Q:But in the beginning you worked in the shoe command --</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">A:I worked in the shoes.</span> <span id="s1409">I worked administratively.</span> <span id="s1410">I worked--I did all kinds of things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">Q:What did you do administratively?</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">A:There were always people who needed things written or they needed things explained, especially translations and I also worked in very often in a kind of a semi medical situation.</span> <span id="s1413">I had a Red Cross diploma so I knew how to do a bandage.</span> <span id="s1414">I knew something, and so I worked in the hospital.</span> <span id="s1415">I always worked in hospitals.</span> <span id="s1416">Hospitals had more food so it wasn't because of the sick you came here, the hospital was not because of the sick.</span> <span id="s1417">I wanted to work there because maybe there was a scrap of food more.</span> <span id="s1418">Always a motive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">Q:You were very calculating.</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">A:A bitch, a real bitch in the sense of-- if I wanted something I got it and I remember exchanging things for cigarettes because cigarettes were more important than the food because a cigarette was a moment of -- I don't know if you've ever been a smoker.</span> <span id="s1421">I gave it up.</span> <span id="s1422">I gave it up before Dachau in 1954 because I had to and then I started again in '70, smoked ‘til about '71 and then my husband died, and then I smoked very little but I gave it up the day before the cancer operation.</span> <span id="s1423">They wouldn’t have operated on me if I smoked.</span> <span id="s1424">Forget it, and they're right.</span> <span id="s1425">But anyway, calculated in the sense that, yes, if I do this will I have a better chance.</span> <span id="s1426">If I don't do this what's going to happen.</span> <span id="s1427">Using common sense, if that's calculating.</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">Q:Did you meet women who were coming in from Auschwitz Birkenau?</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">A:I didn't meet them but I talked to them.</span> <span id="s1430">I talked through the wire to them and I heard the first time about the gassing from these people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">Q:When was that, in August or September?</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">A:No, that is a little later.</span> <span id="s1433">That is the end of September 1944.</span> <span id="s1434">The weather is beginning to get very bad.</span> <span id="s1435">We couldn't stand it there, wire between us anymore because it was either pouring rain or too cold, or we were too sick and they were in tents.</span> <span id="s1436">They came and they didn't have barracks for them anymore and they started putting tents up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">03:25:25 We called them the Zeltfrauen “tent women” and they were the ones who told us that there was gas and that people were killed and we didn't believe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">Q:You didn't believe it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">A:We didn't believe it.</span> <span id="s1440">We didn’t believe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">Q:Did you think they were crazy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">A:We thought they were crazy.</span> <span id="s1443">They were so hungry, they were so underfed, they were so tired from marching all the way from wherever they came from Poland.</span> <span id="s1444">We didn't believe them.</span> <span id="s1445">People wouldn’t do that, we said, even then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">Q:So you weren't hearing with all the Jewish press agency, the rumor mill, you weren't hearing that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">A:We didn't hear anything officially, the Jewish press agency never had it right.</span> <span id="s1448">We didn't hear anything about the invasion.</span> <span id="s1449">We didn't hear anything about D-day.</span> <span id="s1450">I mean there were rumor mills but the business and I can tell you that people who knew heard about it in Holland from people who returned from concentration camps didn't believe it.</span> <span id="s1451">They simply said, “It's not true.”</span> <span id="s1452">Like some people today say they don't believe it but that's different.</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">Q:Do you remember that the camp changed when Joseph Kramer came and became Commandant or is that not a significant moment?</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">A:I forget who the guy was before him.</span> <span id="s1455">There was Kramer and there was another one.</span> <span id="s1456">I remember Irma Grese.</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">03:26:48</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">Q:You do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">A:Yah.</span> <span id="s1460">The famous ward who was cruel and kind and nice to children, but I remember what she looked like.</span> <span id="s1461">She was a hefty blonde and I remember her stiefel, her boots and the whip and I'm not sure whether she was on our appell, we had to be counted, or whether it was in the next camp, or whether she only came in on a Sunday, but I definitely saw her and knew who she was.</span> <span id="s1462">Now, Kramer -- oh God I don't think this is in the diary.</span> <span id="s1463">I told this story to Peter Wiebke when we were, in '86, making the movie and doing something.</span> <span id="s1464">I said, “I didn't only work in the kitchen I also worked in the private quarters of the SS.”</span> <span id="s1465">Because that was next to the kitchen as a cleaning person and I remember that I took the toothbrush and put the toothbrush into the toilet.</span> <span id="s1466">This was my private revenge.</span> <span id="s1467">He would never know but I knew that he would brush his teeth in the shit.</span> <span id="s1468">So you see these are the things and then Peter said, “How come it's not in the diary.”</span> <span id="s1469">I said, “Are you crazy?</span> <span id="s1470">If they would find that, that was censorship.”</span> <span id="s1471">He said, “How come you only remember this now?”</span> <span id="s1472">I said, “I don't know why something...,”it had something to do with kitchens.</span> <span id="s1473">We were eating in kitchens of the NATO.</span> <span id="s1474">You know, this was the army time in Germany.</span> <span id="s1475">And we had a Dutch meal in a Dutch kitchen and somehow the kitchen brought back memories of Bergen-Belsen and here I was discussing diaries and there comes the toothbrush situation and my wiping the wash basin of the SS with a dirty rag and ending up with the tooth brush into the toilet.</span> <span id="s1476">This is magnificent.</span> <span id="s1477">Silent revenge but also very calculated.</span> <span id="s1478">Hopeless.</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">Q:Were you ever brutalized in Bergen-Belsen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">A:No, not ever personally, not in any way.</span> <span id="s1481">Not hit, not...No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">Q:Paul was beaten?</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">A:Paul was very badly beaten and beaten because he was tall so he stood out and the guys were cold.</span> <span id="s1484">They wanted to beat themselves warm as they were pulling out trees and stumps in the winter.</span> <span id="s1485">He was badly beaten.</span> <span id="s1486">He wasn't tortured but he also was put at the entrance as a punishment and made to stand for hours and no food and that is the time when I ate his ration.</span> <span id="s1487">When I knew that he was standing there and practically fainting from exhaustion and hunger, and I ate his bread.</span> <span id="s1488">They had given us two rations, one for him and one for me, and I ate it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">03:30:28</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">Q:Still bothers you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">A:Oh, God it bothers me.</span> <span id="s1492">It didn’t bother Paul because he said very often, he said, “I got something the next day and after all without you I wouldn't be around.”</span> <span id="s1493">I said.</span> <span id="s1494">“I know but I still ate it.”</span> <span id="s1495">You don't eat stuff of a dying person.</span> <span id="s1496">But then I'm so confused now because I remember my doing all my research and finding diaries and there's a guy I think in wherever, Dachau, Neuengamme, who says, how come his porridge, or whatever they had, his soup is still here.</span> <span id="s1497">He must have died so he goes out of there.</span> <span id="s1498">So, that feeling of if there is still something left, I can eat it.</span> <span id="s1499">And there are these unforgettable pictures of people gnawing on bones just to get something.</span> <span id="s1500">Maybe there is something left somewhere which I can eat.</span> <span id="s1501">The stuff we ate is so unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">Q:You describe maggots in the soup?</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">A:I describe maggots but particularly in the train situation I described what we eat.</span> <span id="s1504">We eat anything because we were starving.</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">Q:Were people being cannibals, are you describing people eating human remains?</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">A:No, not humans, but they ate around where there were human remains.</span> <span id="s1507">They...I don't know of any cannibalism but I know that I'm sure of it.</span> <span id="s1508">If you have nothing to eat -- I know of the urine drinking because they had no water.</span> <span id="s1509">O.K.</span> <span id="s1510">That we know.</span> <span id="s1511">We all know that.</span> <span id="s1512">We don't have to talk about that.</span> <span id="s1513">I didn’t though.</span> <span id="s1514">I ate anything.</span> <span id="s1515">I still eat anything from the floor.</span> <span id="s1516">People always say, “How can you stick that in your mouth.”</span> <span id="s1517">I said, “I've had every disease in the world except AIDS.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">Q:In December you wrote the following --</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">03:33:06</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">A:Is this on purpose?</span> <span id="s1521">So it’s not that I can’t get it.</span> <span id="s1522">(indecipherable interchange between Renata and Interviewer)</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">Q:Yes.</span> <span id="s1524">In December you wrote "There are men who have been incarcerated for many years and have not seen a woman for as long a time.</span> <span id="s1525">The consequences could be seen one hour after they took over the camp."</span> <span id="s1526">Then you say nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1527">A:Of course not.</span> <span id="s1528">I mean, the rest is up to you.</span> <span id="s1529">What did you think they did?</span> <span id="s1530">They screwed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">Q:Were they raping women?</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">A:No.</span> <span id="s1533">Am I talking about the --Am I talking about...</span></p> <p><span id="s1534">Q:The kapos.</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">A:Oh, the Kapos.</span> <span id="s1536">I'm talking about the guys who had food.</span> <span id="s1537">I don't think they were raping.</span> <span id="s1538">I think the people there they found were willing.</span> <span id="s1539">There wasn't much rape.</span> <span id="s1540">The Russians raped.</span> <span id="s1541">The Russians raped anybody except if you came out of a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1542">Then you said Konzlager.</span> <span id="s1543">They said, "Let's drink."</span> <span id="s1544">And let’s Kindermachen.</span> <span id="s1545">No, I don't think there was much rape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">Q:But you do talk about kapos having girlfriends?</span></p> <p><span id="s1547">A:Oh yeh.</span> <span id="s1548">I’m talking about...Sex was only possible if you had protein.</span> <span id="s1549">You don't have sex if you starve.</span> <span id="s1550">It's biologically impossible, and the kapos had food until the last minute.</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">Q:So, this was a way for the women to get food?</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">A:Yeh, right.</span> <span id="s1553">This is the way I avoided, already, during the camp because I told myself I would have to give the stuff to Paul.</span> <span id="s1554">He would know.</span> <span id="s1555">It wouldn't be our thing.</span> <span id="s1556">I remember that.</span> <span id="s1557">And a..</span> <span id="s1558">.</span> <span id="s1559">That it wouldn't end with one.</span> <span id="s1560">It would go on and on and on and on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">Q:But you're also very non-judgmental?</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">A:I’m totally non-judgmental.</span> <span id="s1563">No.</span> <span id="s1564">I also feel that if people felt that they could do this -- I tell you one thing.</span> <span id="s1565">I'm thinking now, I've never thought of this before.</span> <span id="s1566">If I wouldn't have had Paul and kind of this feeling of obliged to help him at least, I might have done it because it was only my survival.</span> <span id="s1567">I am only responsible to me.</span> <span id="s1568">So what.</span> <span id="s1569">There was no AIDS.</span> <span id="s1570">You wouldn't get sick.</span> <span id="s1571">What the hell.</span> <span id="s1572">But I didn't feel like it because it wasn't my choice.</span> <span id="s1573">I think this is more significant than anything else.</span> <span id="s1574">I would really feel like a victim if I have to prostitute myself for this.</span> <span id="s1575">This is something, there comes a point when you just say to yourself short of torture, I'll do anything.</span> <span id="s1576">There came a point when I told myself no.</span> <span id="s1577">I remember walking with these guys behind the barracks and they gave me a cigarette and they said, “Let's do it,” and I said, “No way.”</span> <span id="s1578">They said but you can have this or that and I said, "Sorry."</span> <span id="s1579">I usually got something any way.</span> <span id="s1580">I always got something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">Q:It's interesting that these men were not trying to force themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">A:No, because number one they weren't that sexy, sex minded either.</span> <span id="s1583">They always found somebody who might really be willing.</span> <span id="s1584">And they might find somebody who was also fed.</span> <span id="s1585">Look it's no fun if you have no fun at all.</span> <span id="s1586">I don't know.</span> <span id="s1587">I don’t think...I'm totally un-judgmental if people do it.</span> <span id="s1588">I personally didn't do it unless I liked somebody.</span> <span id="s1589">So, we don't talk about these things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">Q:How about children?</span> <span id="s1591">What do you remember about the children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">A:Children...is always...asked this question.</span> <span id="s1593">How was it for children and I said, “I don't know.”</span> <span id="s1594">I'm delighted that I didn't have a child in the camp because it's bad enough to have a husband.</span> <span id="s1595">It's bad enough to have a parent, but to have a child.</span> <span id="s1596">I think I would have done what the other women did, give more to the child than to themselves.</span> <span id="s1597">I mean, this is something they do also in outside life.</span> <span id="s1598">I mean, in our normal life.</span> <span id="s1599">People give and give and give.</span> <span id="s1600">Or abuse and abuse.</span> <span id="s1601">I mean it's the other side.</span> <span id="s1602">They are so fed up that they abuse.</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">03:38:17</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">Q:When there was a family there, so that there was a husband and a wife and a child or more than one child, was the woman having more responsibilities than the man usually?</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">A:Yes, because the man was in a different barrack and the woman was with the child.</span> <span id="s1606">The woman--Let's say the boys until they were a certain age, I don't remember the exact age, but I guess it was the women who had the children with them and the men were in a different barrack and the men came to visit or to do things or whatever.</span> <span id="s1607">So, anyway, yes, because I don't think there were men with sons only, maybe but not little ones, and there were tiny ones.</span> <span id="s1608">They were definitely in the so called “female barrack.”</span> <span id="s1609">But again I'm talking more sense than memory because I don't remember.</span> <span id="s1610">I should.</span> <span id="s1611">There are so many things I should have written about but who the hell knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">Q:How did you save Paul?</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">A:Very simple.</span> <span id="s1614">Being very nasty and still feeding him.</span> <span id="s1615">How did I save him.</span> <span id="s1616">We were in the train.</span> <span id="s1617">In the camp I couldn't save him.</span> <span id="s1618">That was beyond.</span> <span id="s1619">I mean I saved him, but I didn't save his life in the camp.</span> <span id="s1620">I saved Paul's life really in the train.</span> <span id="s1621">Because in the train he was dying.</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">Q:The train is --</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">A:The train is between Bergen-Belsen and near Leipzig where we get liberated, and those ten days I think I remember everything.</span> <span id="s1624">The other thing with Paul was that when we left Bergen-Belsen, when we were pushed out of the camp on whatever day it was, the ninth of April, whatever, he wasn't with me.</span> <span id="s1625">He couldn't walk fast enough.</span> <span id="s1626">He was trailing behind so I lost him.</span> <span id="s1627">I told myself, I must have thought, “Good riddance,” and at the same time, “God now what.”</span> <span id="s1628">When we got to the train, I got somehow in the train.</span> <span id="s1629">I was with the psychiatrist and his son.</span> <span id="s1630">The son's a psychiatrist who, I'll give you the address now, who survived, and I said, ”Where's Paul.”</span> <span id="s1631">He said, “Paul is over there.</span> <span id="s1632">Try to get him into the train somewhere.”</span> <span id="s1633">So Paul got into a carriage, three or four carriages behind mine.</span> <span id="s1634">And somehow I used every connection, every possibility I had to get him into my carriage.</span> <span id="s1635">And in my carriage he was lying on the floor near the door and near the toilet and I was still sitting and he was lying there and he couldn't move.</span> <span id="s1636">He couldn't cough.</span> <span id="s1637">He couldn't swallow.</span> <span id="s1638">He was dying.</span> <span id="s1639">And I told myself, “You better do something.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">03:41:44 And I began to do things.</span> <span id="s1641">I began to find water.</span> <span id="s1642">I began to find whatever I could find outside the carriage, a raw potato, this or that.</span> <span id="s1643">Once we got bread and so on.</span> <span id="s1644">And I began to organize with that psychiatrist’s son, Louis M. Tas.</span> <span id="s1645">We went and we went into the fields and you read the story about when we go into the mine fields and we try to get beets and carrots and potatoes and whatever and we go into German houses and we bring food back and I spoon fed Paul back into life.</span> <span id="s1646">Then we get into the Russian liberation camp, the hospital and then I get typhus.</span> <span id="s1647">And just...Just in that time Paul begins to sit up and he begins to spoon feed me sugar, tea because I have had this incredible high fever and encephalitis.</span> <span id="s1648">I had these tremendous headaches and he feeds me and I have fed him and this becomes a relationship which has to stop because we basically hate each other.</span> <span id="s1649">We hate each other.</span> <span id="s1650">We have survived something we didn't want.</span> <span id="s1651">He is at that time -- I'm 24 and he's going on 29 and I want so many different things from him.</span> <span id="s1652">He wants to get back to his "speech therapy" and maybe finally get into medical school if he can ever get a diploma.</span> <span id="s1653">I want to go and have food and fun and Paris...., Paris for becoming a fashion designer.</span> <span id="s1654">It never occurred to me to do anything else.</span> <span id="s1655">I had doodled in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s1656">The doodles are in the diary by the way and they’re in an exposition in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s1657">But anyway, we are growing apart like this because we are totally different.</span> <span id="s1658">He gets depressed again.</span> <span id="s1659">I get--I have to get my morals again.</span> <span id="s1660">We grow apart and we try to stay together by having a family.</span> <span id="s1661">So, I have one miscarriage after another.</span> <span id="s1662">Finally we have a child.</span> <span id="s1663">The child is eight and half months pregnant and it chokes itself inside my belly.</span> <span id="s1664">It's born dead.</span> <span id="s1665">That's the end of the marriage.</span> <span id="s1666">That is 1947 in the fall.</span> <span id="s1667">He has his girlfriend and I have my boyfriends and we finally decide in '50 when Deso has arrived in '50, he said, “That's the man you should have married.”</span> <span id="s1668">And we remained friends.</span> <span id="s1669">The interesting thing is he always...he didn't want children.</span> <span id="s1670">He said, “I don't want children in this depressing world.</span> <span id="s1671">What the hell.</span> <span id="s1672">Maybe we adopt, maybe we should have somebody else's child, an orphan from the war or whatever.”</span> <span id="s1673">I said, “No, if we have a child, it's our child.”</span> <span id="s1674">He said, “I don't want any children.”</span> <span id="s1675">He marries the second time.</span> <span id="s1676">He has four children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1677">03:45:45</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">Q:Do you know his children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1679">A:Not only do I know his children, I know his wife.</span> <span id="s1680">I became very good friends with her.</span> <span id="s1681">She was a young Dutch, half nobility, half whatever, totally Dutch.</span> <span id="s1682">And she was the one whom I asked before I went to America in 1952 I said Helene you have been living with Paul...And we divorced in '50, and in '52 I finally immigrated to Canada.</span> <span id="s1683">I couldn't go to America because I was born in Germany and the German quota was full and I couldn't get out.</span> <span id="s1684">So, I went to Canada on my Dutch passport.</span> <span id="s1685">I went to Helene, and I said, “Why don't you marry Paul finally.</span> <span id="s1686">I am leaving.”</span> <span id="s1687">She said, “I won't marry a Jew.”</span> <span id="s1688">I said, “You won't what?”</span> <span id="s1689">I said, “You've been living with the guy.</span> <span id="s1690">He has been baptized.</span> <span id="s1691">Already his father is this.”</span> <span id="s1692">She said, “I won't marry him because my family wouldn't stand for it.”</span> <span id="s1693">I said, “Screw you.</span> <span id="s1694">I can't do that.</span> <span id="s1695">You can't live with a guy and fall in love with him and not marry him.”</span> <span id="s1696">She married him and she had four children with him.</span> <span id="s1697">Finally she got breast cancer.</span> <span id="s1698">She died.</span> <span id="s1699">But they were divorced already.</span> <span id="s1700">He found a friend in Germany where he had moved because he could easier find work in Germany in his field than in Holland.</span> <span id="s1701">A long story, nothing to do with me.</span> <span id="s1702">And the interesting thing is that Paul always said, “One of the best things which ever happened to me is not that you saved my life but that we met and it was wonderful.”</span> <span id="s1703">That's nice.</span> <span id="s1704">That is nice.</span> <span id="s1705">“You saved my life, of course it's wonderful.”</span> <span id="s1706">But he is so depressed that he sometimes feels, “What's life?”</span> <span id="s1707">I don't know.</span> <span id="s1708">Last question, what do you want to know besides this?</span> <span id="s1709">You must be dead tired.</span> <span id="s1710">These are all stories of other people and how they relate, this is not necessarily a Holocaust story because it has nothing to do with the horror of Auschwitz and Birkenau.</span> <span id="s1711">If you're being shoved into the gas, it's much, much worse I think than being starved and diseased.</span> <span id="s1712">I don't know.</span> <span id="s1713">I think because this is the final victimization because even if you are dying of hunger, even though you're dying of disease, you still have a certain control.</span> <span id="s1714">If you're being pushed into a shower and it turns out to poison you...This is my fear of the anesthesia also.</span> <span id="s1715">Anything which is done to me where I can't be in control.</span></p> <p><span id="s1716">03:49:32</span></p> <p><span id="s1717">Q:You don't feel like a victim, do you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1718">A:No, that’s why I also feel so guilty and that maybe also the reason why I feel almost frivolous.</span> <span id="s1719">The fact that I talk about and wear lipstick, the fact that I am "not looking my age" is not an effort.</span> <span id="s1720">It's just I'm a survivor.</span> <span id="s1721">By the way, why do you look so good at age 57.</span> <span id="s1722">That is a matter of skin and haircut and also personality.</span> <span id="s1723">I love your haircut.</span> <span id="s1724">I hope it doesn’t cost 300 dollars, because mine cost 15.</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">Q:What do you think that is about that you -- I understand that Bergen-Belsen is not Auschwitz Birkenau, but in reading your diary it's clear how difficult it was and one did not know whether it was going to end?</span></p> <p><span id="s1726">A:Unbelievably difficult but not final.</span></p> <p><span id="s1727">Q:But you didn't know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1728">A:That's right, but the people in Auschwitz knew.</span> <span id="s1729">The smoke, the pipe, the fear of going through the pipe.</span> <span id="s1730">You know.</span> <span id="s1731">The smoke of the crematoria.</span> <span id="s1732">We had no gas in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">Q:But you had a lot of death in Bergen-Belsen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1734">A:Death?</span></p> <p><span id="s1735">Q:Death.</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">A:By the loaves.</span> <span id="s1737">An unbelievable amount of dying percentage wise because people were dying of disease and starvation, but that's a different death than by being pushed into -- I don't know.</span> <span id="s1738">To me it's much more horrible.</span> <span id="s1739">Because it's so phony, it's so typical German.</span> <span id="s1740">You tell them they're going to have a shower.</span> <span id="s1741">You tell them, “You're going to be disinfected.”</span> <span id="s1742">You're being killed.</span> <span id="s1743">In Bergen-Belsen they didn't tell you that we're not going to kill you.</span> <span id="s1744">They said we don't give a shit whether you die.</span> <span id="s1745">Wir lassen Euch stehen bis Euch die Scheisse runterläuft, “we let you stand here on the appell until the shit comes out of you.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1746">03:52:07 They didn't give a damn, but they knew.</span> <span id="s1747">It wasn't a fake.</span> <span id="s1748">They weren't faking the people like I later get in the diaries where they make people up so that they have -- the women make themselves up so that they have rosy cheeks or rosy lips so they will not go to the left or to the right.</span> <span id="s1749">I mean I'm talking about something which is a totally different situation.</span> <span id="s1750">It's almost silken zores.</span> <span id="s1751">As my Jewish husband said, my second one.</span> <span id="s1752">He said, “seidene zores.”</span> <span id="s1753">If you compare this to going into poison gas.</span></p> <p><span id="s1754">Q:It's interesting.</span> <span id="s1755">Not everybody has that kind of perspective.</span> <span id="s1756">You obviously have a perspective of being able to compare, and to...Do you know what I mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1757">A:This is what they call the impersonal...impersonal situation in my diary.</span> <span id="s1758">To me this is that I kept the perspective.</span> <span id="s1759">And the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung writes about this, and he said, the amazing thing is also the second book that I could write a dissertation about this crap.</span> <span id="s1760">He said that, “She has the emotional distance to be able to objectify the horrible experience.”</span> <span id="s1761">To me it is nothing else than survivorism.</span> <span id="s1762">It's a mechanism.</span></p> <p><span id="s1763">Q:Is it from your father's scientific perspective that you can some way think you don't have --?</span></p> <p><span id="s1764">A:You mean just because I grew up with appendixes in vinegar, experiments and stuff?</span> <span id="s1765">No, No, No.</span> <span id="s1766">No, because I'm not a scientist but I'm very organized and I'm -- I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1767">Q:Is there anything you'd like to say about your experiences that you don't think you've said?</span></p> <p><span id="s1768">A:Yes, I'd love to read that because this will bring back what I'm talking about.</span> <span id="s1769">The mere fact that I can say today is July 1969 on June 15," on Thursday, June 15, 1944 I am thinking a lot about after the war.</span> <span id="s1770">Will we ever be able to convey what these camp years have meant for us when we talk with someone who has not actually lived through a similar experience himself.</span> <span id="s1771">What it is like to see from behind barbed wire, tall, green fir trees and new vegetable crops growing along the camp road, what the constant pressure and coercion by SS guards and their perennial check ups really mean.</span> <span id="s1772">How you try all the time to convince yourself that it does not touch you.</span> <span id="s1773">All this shouting, cursing and kicking that you notice that you're growing older and that you're used to slipping through your fingers in these long years of waiting for the end of oppression.</span> <span id="s1774">What the months mean when you count them in hours, days and weeks.</span> <span id="s1775">And in which the only bright spots are sleep, warm soup, and sometimes a ray of sun on the way back to the barracks after another endless roll call in the damp chill of the big center Appell fields.</span> <span id="s1776">Good moments also, the thoughts and dreams about before.</span> <span id="s1777">Homesick and more homesick and whether it's the Frenchwomen who sing about “Paree, Paree,” or the Italians in their brightly patched Mediterranean get ups or the Greek, Spanish Jews from Salonika.</span> <span id="s1778">They all think of and yearn for only one single thing: home, going home after the war.</span> <span id="s1779">And what is home?</span> <span id="s1780">Will we be able to find our way back from the concentration camp universe into a world in which most of us have no longer any other possessions than the memories of before the war and in which we will live among people to whom our years of imprisonment will only mean --"Oh, there's another one of those who only complain about lost things and tell horror stories."</span> <span id="s1781">This is true.</span> <span id="s1782">Now, if you put this while you're there how much have you written yourself out of the situation.</span> <span id="s1783">I climbed above it, out of it and was neither in the past or in the future but I was me.</span> <span id="s1784">They couldn't take it away and I think this is not only me, this is where I feel this camp diaries are crucial to show what human beings could do with their brain.</span> <span id="s1785">Write themselves above, out, and through it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1786">Q:Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1787">A:You’re welcome.</span> <span id="s1788">I'm delighted I could do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1789">03:57:52</span></p> <p><span id="s1790">Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s1791">(Viewing pictures)</span></p> <p><span id="s1792">4:01:04</span></p> <p><span id="s1793">Q:Could you tell us who is in this picture here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1794">A:The lady in the back is my mother.</span> <span id="s1795">She is Margarethe Laqueur.</span> <span id="s1796">It is 1928 in Amsterdam in our home and that's me with the bangs and the dark hair and it's my sister Lilo, Liselotte and that's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1797">Q:You were the taller person, the taller child?</span></p> <p><span id="s1798">A:I'm the taller child.</span> <span id="s1799">I'm the older child.</span></p> <p><span id="s1800">Q:Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1801">A:It's 1931 again in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s1802">I was born in '19, I must have been 12.</span></p> <p><span id="s1803">Q:When was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1804">A:The winter of '35-'36 in Amsterdam.</span></p> <p><span id="s1805">Q:Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1806">A:'35, another sad picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s1807">Q:Do you remember the colors?</span></p> <p><span id="s1808">A:Yah, navy blue and white.</span></p> <p><span id="s1809">Q:Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1810">A:This is March 1940, two months before the occupation and what I'm wearing is a white silk blouse and an ivory rose.</span> <span id="s1811">I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1812">Q:Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1813">A:That's a pre-wedding picture in 1941 just before I got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s1814">Q:Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1815">A:This is the 24th of December 1941 my wedding day and I think we are looking at the wedding registration or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1816">Q:Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1817">A:The deed is done.</span> <span id="s1818">We are married.</span> <span id="s1819">And the woman on the right side with the hat is my sister Lilo and the woman behind her is my sister-in-law and that's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1820">Q:Which one is your sister-in-law?</span></p> <p><span id="s1821">A:The one with the hat behind the one with hat.</span> <span id="s1822">Lilo is right next to Paul.</span> <span id="s1823">December 1941, wedding picture with my parents.</span> <span id="s1824">My father, my mother, Paul and myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1825">Q:Can you give us your father's name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1826">A:Ernst Laqueur and Margarethe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1827">Q:Okay, when

flannel shirt I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1831">End of interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s1832">Renata Laqueur has added an addendum to her interview release form in regards to the statement:
