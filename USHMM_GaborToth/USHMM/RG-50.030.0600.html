to have you here with us.</span> <span id="s15">Thank you.</span> <span id="s16">Could you please say your name yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Answer: Eleanor Rolfe.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: Could you please tell us when were you born and where?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: January 31st, 1930 in Hamburg, Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: Can you tell me what are your first recollections of your family life in Hamburg, Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: Surprisingly, I can remember back to when I was three years old, which always amazes my brother.</span> <span id="s22">I remember that in my bedroom, they put a rug with flowers in the middle and a design around the edge.</span> <span id="s23">And I wouldn't let anybody walk on the flowers.</span> <span id="s24">And I would go around the corner to my bed.</span> <span id="s25">And that's my first memory of my room.</span> <span id="s26">But I then I did remember my daughter went to Germany with me in '74, I think.</span> <span id="s27">And I we went to where I lived, my house and but it wasn't until was that when we went into the house?</span> <span id="s28">I don't remember.</span> <span id="s29">We went back in 2001, the spring before 9/11.</span> <span id="s30">And I was invited by the City of Hamburg.</span> <span id="s31">And my husband said for my daughter to come with me because she would remember this and pass it onto her children.</span> <span id="s32">So it was a wonderful trip.</span> <span id="s33">And I had explained how my house, my apartment was laid out.</span> <span id="s34">And I had a veranda in front of my room.</span> <span id="s35">And we went and knocked on the door or we were standing in front of the place and people said can we help you?</span> <span id="s36">And it was an American married to a German.</span> <span id="s37">And I told him that this was the house where I was born.</span> <span id="s38">And so they invited us in.</span> <span id="s39">And it was really interesting because she said to me, Mom, this is exactly the way you described it.</span> <span id="s40">So I could we jump ahead?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: I would like to maybe ask you also about your family.</span> <span id="s42">You said you had a brother.</span> <span id="s43">Was it an older brother or younger brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: Yes, my brother is three years older.</span> <span id="s45">And we were completely assimilated in Germany.</span> <span id="s46">My father had been in the German army, and had all sorts of medals.</span> <span id="s47">He was injured in the first World War.</span> <span id="s48">And we had a Christmas tree.</span> <span id="s49">I didn't really know I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s50">I went to public school until quite late, then I had to change schools.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: What language did you speak at home, was this German?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: German, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: Did you have any Jewish friends or just German friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: Of course I had my grandmother and grandfather and my uncle who had was somewhat disabled.</span> <span id="s55">He had the flu in 1918 and stopped his mental development so he was though he was an adult, he was approximately the age of twelve or thirteen.</span> <span id="s56">We played a lot of games he taught me games and things.</span> <span id="s57">My grandparents lived quite a walking distance.</span> <span id="s58">And there was another German family living near us and, yes, I was friends with them.</span> <span id="s59">I can't really recollect a lot of friends, I guess they didn't stay in my memory.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: Would you say that your family was a religious family?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: No, my mother came from an orthodox, very orthodox home.</span> <span id="s62">And she rebelled against it because she said that they were not allowed to do anything on the Sabbath, and her father would walk outside and get around the corner and light a cigar.</span> <span id="s63">So although they had a maid, I guess, who was allowed to turn the light on but she so she married my dad.</span> <span id="s64">My dad came there was a lot of money in the family, but my father was not raised Jewish, although both his parents were.</span> <span id="s65">His father died when he was three.</span> <span id="s66">And he was a playboy.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: And he was he went to law school and was an attorney.</span> <span id="s69">And as I remember what my mother said, her father who was orthodox really stepped in between that and didn't want to marry her to marry my dad.</span> <span id="s70">And so she was sent to England for a year and told if you still want to marry him when you come back after a year, it's okay.</span> <span id="s71">So she did that.</span> <span id="s72">And my parents kept everything.</span> <span id="s73">I have papers and papers and papers.</span> <span id="s74">I have all of their letters.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: Really.</span> <span id="s76">That's very valuable.</span> <span id="s77">We are I'm sure going to talk about that in a little bit too.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: You mentioned that your brother was three years older than you were.</span> <span id="s80">What's his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: His name was Osfeld Eric Stark (ph).</span> <span id="s82">My mother specifically, she was always worried about the situation.</span> <span id="s83">But probably because of her background because she was orthodox.</span> <span id="s84">My father felt it was a German.</span> <span id="s85">And my mother gave us each international names.</span> <span id="s86">Eleanor is good in any language and Eric also.</span> <span id="s87">So but in Germany my brother was called Osfeld (ph).</span> <span id="s88">And so he changed it, of course, to Eric Osfeld.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: Were you very close with your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: Quite.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: Did you play a lot together, did you go to the same school?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: I'm not sure.</span> <span id="s93">I was eight when I went on the Kindertransport, but I was about five, I think, five or six when my brother was sent to boarding school in England.</span> <span id="s94">And my brother was very precocious and very intelligent, and he was constantly listening to what we then called the wireless, and so it was could you go up and get that postcard?</span> <span id="s95">So they sent him to boarding school in England by a German teacher at Bunscord (ph) you probably heard that before.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: I have to say that I'm hearing that for the first time right now.</span> <span id="s97">Could you explain what it is?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: It was a boarding school for German Jewish children.</span> <span id="s99">And it was headed up by a woman and something I don't remember the name, but I think I have it written.</span> <span id="s100">We called her Tatta Ana (ph).</span> <span id="s101">And by the time well, a lot of the children from wealthy families were sent there, especially the boys.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: So you mentioned that your family was quite affluent, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: Was it also the case with your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: What was your father, I believe you mentioned, was a lawyer?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: And your mother, did she also work?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: No, she was a housewife although we had lots of maids.</span> <span id="s110">So she didn't really do anything.</span> <span id="s111">And remember that in 1937, my father bought a car, Mercedes Benz.</span> <span id="s112">And I was told later by one of my cousins that Dad was the only one our family was the only one who owned a car in the '30s.</span> <span id="s113">I remember that when my father bought this car, it was green.</span> <span id="s114">I have a picture of it at home.</span> <span id="s115">My mother immediately had to have a driving suit made to match the car.</span> <span id="s116">Things I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">I lived a very typical European life that was certainly totally opposite of what my life with my children was, but it was my parents would send me to kindaponceons (ph) on holidays.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: What are those?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: Those were ponceon (ph) is like a camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: Uh huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: Children's camp and it was I remember I was in Switzerland over the new year.</span> <span id="s122">My parents entertained a lot.</span> <span id="s123">And I was in Belgium in the summers.</span> <span id="s124">And I was pretty little, but it was organized, you know.</span> <span id="s125">And I don't ever remember even sitting on my father's lap.</span> <span id="s126">It was very distant relationship.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: Were you also distant with your mother or just with your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: Mostly with my father, yeah.</span> <span id="s129">But I don't remember long conversations with my mother.</span> <span id="s130">It just wasn't the thing to do in those days.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: I can assume that.</span> <span id="s132">Did you play with her at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: I don't remember playing with her, no.</span> <span id="s134">I played with my uncle who lived with my grandparents and he taught me games and dominoes and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s135">I remember that.</span> <span id="s136">He was the only grown up that ever paid attention to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: Was that the uncle you mentioned that was sick with the flu?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: Was that the uncle you mentioned before that was sick with the flu as a young boy?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: Yes, he had the flu in 1918.</span> <span id="s141">And he was fine, but he was disabled.</span> <span id="s142">I mean, he had a little bit of a lame arm and his mind stopped developing, but he was lovely, lovely person, very lovable.</span> <span id="s143">And I think he enjoyed being with me.</span> <span id="s144">I remember on Christmas we even had a Christmas tree fire once because in those days, there were candles on them.</span> <span id="s145">I don't know how they managed that.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: They were real, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: They were real candles, and they hung those little rings on the tree, that chocolate candy with the little white dots, nonpareils.</span> <span id="s148">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: I'm trying to imagine how it looks.</span> <span id="s150">Chocolate candy with the little white dots, like sugar?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: Confectionary sugar on top of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: In this country they are nonpareils and they're dark chocolate with sugary white little things.</span> <span id="s154">And they were rings, and they were hung on the tree along with other things.</span> <span id="s155">And I remember putting our shoes at Christmastime or before Christmas.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">We also had a Menorah, I think, that was passed down.</span> <span id="s157">And I don't remember it in my home in Germany, but we had a big, beautiful, silver Menorah that I first really experienced when we came to the United States.</span> <span id="s158">And I know that what I got back together with my parents.</span> <span id="s159">You wanted to know what else did you want to know about Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: I wanted to also ask you're obviously saying that you were living in the multi religious environment, right, both the Christmas tree and a menorah?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: I don't remember the Menorah in my German house.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: Not in the German house, but that was here in the states, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s164">And I think the Menorah was with my grandparents.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: It was handed down from my mother's family.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s168">Did you ever do you recall going to the synagogue or performing any</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: Did you know any Jewish prayers?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: How about the atmosphere in the City of Hamburg, do you remember what it was before the outbreak of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: It was before although my mother was very aware, she told me later, she was very frightened, but in 19 I believe '36 or '37 is when they sent my brother away, but I was still there.</span> <span id="s174">And I had a pretty normal life.</span> <span id="s175">I remember may mother taking me to some tailor to have my clothes made.</span> <span id="s176">And I know that what you looked like was terribly important.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: Certainly.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: Very German.</span> <span id="s179">I do remember having very close to the end when I was sent away, I had to change schools.</span> <span id="s180">I believe that because my father was an attorney and some kind of a municipal judge, and I do believe that</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: There is a little gnat here.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: God, I can't get rid of it.</span> <span id="s183">Okay.</span> <span id="s184">That's why he he always said this is happening to all of those Jews, not us.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: I see, so he didn't believe that the growing tension was going to have any effect</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: On him.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: on your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: No.</span> <span id="s189">No.</span> <span id="s190">I possibly deep in his heart, he was might have been thinking fooling himself, but he was so much a German and never really considered himself Jewish.</span> <span id="s191">And I believe his parents were also assimilated.</span> <span id="s192">He came from a very wealthy family.</span> <span id="s193">I know very little about his family.</span> <span id="s194">I believe that originally the family came from Holland because the name Stork is quite Dutch.</span> <span id="s195">But I remember visiting his mother very rarely.</span> <span id="s196">She was very stiff, pompous woman.</span> <span id="s197">I never my mother's parents were very loving, but I don't really know much about his parents.</span> <span id="s198">He was my my Grandfather Stork died when Dad was three years old right around the turn of the century.</span> <span id="s199">My father was born in 1897.</span> <span id="s200">And I had many, many years it never dawned on me that I thought he had a heart attack and died.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: Not until many, many years later, my aunt that I visited in Boston told me oh, no, your grandfather committed suicide.</span> <span id="s203">He had some financial set backs.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: And I was so relieved because one of my sons very much looks like my family.</span> <span id="s206">My other son is very much like his dad's family.</span> <span id="s207">And Brian always said I'm fine.</span> <span id="s208">I don't need the checkups and stuff.</span> <span id="s209">And I said you have to get a checkup.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: Because of the heart issue, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: Because I thought my grandfather died of a heart attack.</span> <span id="s212">And my father had his first heart attack when he was in his 50s.</span> <span id="s213">And so I was and Brian finally had his wife made him have a checkup.</span> <span id="s214">And he wrote to me he lived in different places.</span> <span id="s215">He's been part of corporate America.</span> <span id="s216">And he wrote to me and said or he called me and he said mom, my heart's perfect.</span> <span id="s217">So and then of course my aunt told me, oh, no, your grandfather committed suicide.</span> <span id="s218">Best news I ever had.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: That's unusual.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: But I guess I can see your point personally.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: Well, yeah, when my father was three years old, he was a child late in life.</span> <span id="s223">He was pretty much raised by an older brother who was already 20 when</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: when Dad was a little boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s227">You mentioned that you were going to school already in Germany.</span> <span id="s228">You said that you left at the age of 8, right, so you must have started really early.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: Well, yes, I was in school in Germany, and it was certainly not a Jewish school.</span> <span id="s230">Very not long before I was sent away.</span> <span id="s231">I had to change schools.</span> <span id="s232">And I believe it was very scary in those times.</span> <span id="s233">But until then it didn't really affect me.</span> <span id="s234">My mother, of course, but she never would have told me.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: She __+ already afraid of what you are saying, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: Yes, about the precarious situation we were in Germany.</span> <span id="s237">And as I have studied history and learned, I was appalled at how my father could have kept us there.</span> <span id="s238">He could have left.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">My mother had a huge family and they all left in early '30s, up to '37 and they settled in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s240">They were in the tobacco business, and continued their business in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s241">And my mother wanted to leave, but my father in retrospect, I understand, that my father knew that he would have to start life all over again if he left Germany because he was an attorney and a judge in Germany, and German law is based on Roman law.</span> <span id="s242">And</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: if he went to England or the United States, he could not practice law.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: That's right.</span> <span id="s246">He would have to start pretty much from the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: And he was a very arrogant man.</span> <span id="s248">Like I said, this is happening to all of the other Jews, not me.</span> <span id="s249">So I I don't remember doing much with my parents except for when my father bought a car, we used to on Sundays, go out into the suburbs, I guess, and I remember buying ice on a stick that was, you know, it was quite new.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: Popsicles.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: In the late '30s.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: And, yeah.</span> <span id="s254">But I, now looking back, my father lived such an affluent life.</span> <span id="s255">But most people in Germany didn't have cars in the '30s.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: Certainly not that was a very poor time, the recession, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s258">Well, it was inflation.</span> <span id="s259">And my father did tell me that during he went to Heidelberg to college and he told he told of times when they had to take boxes of money to the store, you know, because of the inflation.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s261">I see because you had to have so much money</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: to have a certain amount to pay.</span> <span id="s264">I see.</span> <span id="s265">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: I don't believe he ever really suffered from it because he had lots of money.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: So your father never really thought that the situation was going to be dangerous</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: for him or his family?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: He would not believe it.</span> <span id="s271">My parents I have at home albums, many of them of my parents' trips.</span> <span id="s272">They went mountain climbing and they went to Pompeii for a wedding trip.</span> <span id="s273">And my father was an amateur photographer.</span> <span id="s274">And he had photographs of everything.</span> <span id="s275">They went on many, many trips; never with children.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s277">Could you please tell me who made the decision, and how did it happen that you actually were a part of the Kindertransport?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: Yes, my father was in court on the morning of the Kristanoff.</span> <span id="s279">And he was arrested right in court.</span> <span id="s280">I mean, he was taken.</span> <span id="s281">His original law partner who was also a good friend was a man by the name of Dr. Sieveking who, of course, that's the first thing my mother called when she found out Dad was gone.</span> <span id="s282">And he went there's a concentration camp right near Hamburgh which is called Neuengamme, and I understand that my that Dr. Sieveking traced back to where my father was, went to Neuengamme, and told him you can't have this man.</span> <span id="s283">Brought him home.</span> <span id="s284">I remember my father coming home and who was he was always this beautifully dressed, clean cut gorgeous man and he came back home.</span> <span id="s285">His head was shaved and he was ghast looked horrible.</span> <span id="s286">He was only in a camp for a short while.</span> <span id="s287">And Dr. Sieveking came over the Nazis, the same time my father was arrested and taken, my mother, of course, didn't know for quite a while what happened to him, but the SS troops came into our home and searched everything and pushed us around.</span> <span id="s288">It was just me and my mother by that time.</span> <span id="s289">I remember I think it was probably quite early that we could no longer have maids or nannies so</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: __+</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: I remember how my mother cried when Kata (ph) was this nanny, I guess, who was always with us.</span> <span id="s292">And then we had a cook and they all had to leave.</span> <span id="s293">And my mother didn't learn how to cook until she came over to the United States.</span> <span id="s294">But so we were alone, my mother and I were alone.</span> <span id="s295">My brother had already been sent to England.</span> <span id="s296">And then Dr. Sieveking came back.</span> <span id="s297">It was very frightening when the Nazis went through our apartment, and messed around, you know, pushed us around.</span> <span id="s298">But then Dr. Sieveking brought my dad back and oh, my, he looked terrible.</span> <span id="s299">And he took over, Dr. Sieveking, he said Eleanor is going on the Kindertransport.</span> <span id="s300">He took care of the whole thing.</span> <span id="s301">And he after I was gone, I he arranged for my parents to go to Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s302">He even had the car transported to Amsterdam because he knew my father could sell it for money.</span> <span id="s303">By the way, he was not Jewish.</span> <span id="s304">Dr. Sieveking, who he was the son of a former mayor of Hamburgh and apparently my father and he was very close, law partners.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: Would you spell his name with an "S"</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: Sieveking is a "Z"</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: "Z."</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: I think.</span> <span id="s309">Sieveking.</span> <span id="s310">I have papers at home, yeah.</span> <span id="s311">And there's a Sieveking Platz in Hamburg, very famous people.</span> <span id="s312">And so anyway he got me on the Kindertransport.</span> <span id="s313">He told my mother exactly what to put in the suitcase and a little one.</span> <span id="s314">And</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: What was in your suitcase, do you remember that?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: Would you believe a muff.</span> <span id="s317">I remember my parents my mother always had little coats and hats made with a matching muff.</span> <span id="s318">Why they sent a muff I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: Was it in winter?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: Yes, it was.</span> <span id="s321">And it was November, you know.</span> <span id="s322">I think I left I was told that I left on the first Kindertransport from Hamburgh.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: So it probably was</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: Very early December.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s326">Early December.</span> <span id="s327">In '38, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s329">And I as I remember, there were warm clothes and but I don't remember a whole lot.</span> <span id="s330">I think there was a doll, but I could have just been imagining that.</span> <span id="s331">It was the whole trip was kind of vague.</span> <span id="s332">I know I remember it wasn't so horrendous for me because I was used to being sent places.</span> <span id="s333">For holidays, they would put me on a train or something like that with a nanny.</span> <span id="s334">And I went places so horrible life, really when you think back on it.</span> <span id="s335">But so it was I remember being with all of these children, and I remember when we went it could have been through Holland, before we crossed the channel and the train, all of a sudden, opened the windows and people reached in and gave us oranges and things.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: In Holland, right, after you crossed the border?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s338">And I remember that very clearly, and everybody was joyous.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: Were you, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s341">Like I say, I was used to being sent away for holidays and things.</span> <span id="s342">I, at one time, it came back to me in memory.</span> <span id="s343">My parents lived a very adult life.</span> <span id="s344">And at one time I was sent to a summer camp where we were abused and I had to sit on a potty until I had a BM no matter what and oh, it was horrible.</span> <span id="s345">And I apparently would talk to my mother on the phone or I I must have been five years old or something.</span> <span id="s346">But anyway somehow and they didn't believe me.</span> <span id="s347">They didn't, you know, they never really believed me until all of a sudden all the parents came, and the camp was closed.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: Because of the abuse, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: Yes, because I was not the only one apparently, you know.</span> <span id="s350">And finally they got, oh, I remember that was so horrible.</span> <span id="s351">But never really having holidays with your parents.</span> <span id="s352">I remember going to Belgium on a beach where they had the little houses, you know, canvass little things, and I was always there with nannies.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: With nannies.</span> <span id="s354">And who walked you to the train station?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: I don't know how I got there; probably with the car, I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: Was were your parents there or your uncle?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: I think Dr. Sieveking was there.</span> <span id="s358">I don't remember my dad, but my mother, my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: What about the uncle that you were so close with?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: No, he was sent to Holland.</span> <span id="s361">My mother and her siblings had promised to my grandparents that they will always take care of Walter.</span> <span id="s362">And my grandmother died in '37, my mother's mother.</span> <span id="s363">And my grandfather died about six months later of a broken heart kind of.</span> <span id="s364">He just couldn't make it alone.</span> <span id="s365">And so which was very good because he died before that but so it was when my grandparents were so sick and passed on that my Uncle Walter was sent to Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: So Uncle Walter, that was your brother your mother's brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: Uh huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: And very interesting story, but I won't even go into it.</span> <span id="s370">There's a book written about him because he was murdered by a famous Dutch playwright.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: During the war or after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: During the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: What was the name of the playwright?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: A very famous man.</span> <span id="s375">Many lawsuits and I've been in Holland, though they found me.</span> <span id="s376">Oh, Von Von it will come to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s378">We can come back to that later.</span> <span id="s379">I can ask you that question later.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: But anyway I remember only the oranges that were given to us through the windows.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: Do you remember crossing the border at all?</span> <span id="s382">Do you remember Germans, the German border patrol?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: No, personally not.</span> <span id="s384">I could say that I do, but I have seen movies and things of it, but I don't remember.</span> <span id="s385">Maybe I fell asleep.</span> <span id="s386">I don't know.</span> <span id="s387">I don't remember being frightened until we got to I believe it was London.</span> <span id="s388">And I remember standing in the railway station there where the train was going and on the deck, I guess they call it.</span> <span id="s389">And people were standing there and just taking kids, you know.</span> <span id="s390">And an elderly couple I was very small for my age.</span> <span id="s391">I was eight years old.</span> <span id="s392">And an elderly couple took me, took me home with them.</span> <span id="s393">And I came from great affluence and these were people that were very nice and loving, but they didn't have the central heating, and they lived a very simple life.</span> <span id="s394">And I remember being very tired, and they had a bed for me and they heated the bed oh, God, it was cold.</span> <span id="s395">They heated the bed with an old First World War canteen, metal one filled</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: No, I need to __+</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: So, anyway that's why oh, by the way, when we moved to Seattle, and we moved to the house, my father said okay, now that you're Jewish, you better go to religious school.</span> <span id="s398">So he he made me go to temple __ Sunday school.</span> <span id="s399">Well, now you don't have a very good time in Sunday school if your parents don't belong to the temple.</span> <span id="s400">So and I didn't have the right clothes and I started going to Sunday school at the age of probably 11 or 12, I don't know, 11, maybe.</span> <span id="s401">And I didn't know any Hebrew.</span> <span id="s402">And by that time those kids had all learned stuff.</span> <span id="s403">And teachers couldn't understand why I was so stupid.</span> <span id="s404">And it wasn't a very good experience.</span> <span id="s405">So I remember after awhile, I had to take the bus to Sunday school and I would take the bus, and I would not get off at Sunday school.</span> <span id="s406">I would go on downtown Seattle and walk around and watch my time and then come back home at the right time.</span> <span id="s407">So that I didn't even go.</span> <span id="s408">So in high school I have not terribly good memories of all of that.</span> <span id="s409">I was geography, I have never been terribly good at math, but geography and history is what I loved.</span> <span id="s410">Let's see</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: Do you think that has something to do with the fact that you traveled so much?</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: Probably.</span> <span id="s413">I don't know but, you know, my brother was, like I said, this incredibly intelligent kid and he when my father did buy a car in Seattle, and Eric taught himself how to fix cars.</span> <span id="s414">And long before he was able to drive, old enough to drive, he was a night manager then it was a McKale's gas station.</span> <span id="s415">McKale's doesn't exist anymore, but it was a chain.</span> <span id="s416">Here was this kid who not old enough to drive but he was the night manager of a gas station.</span> <span id="s417">The house that we bought was built at the turn of the century, and still had gas lamps up in the attics.</span> <span id="s418">And my brother rewired things so that we have lights and stuff.</span> <span id="s419">And so my mother I would my father used it was awful.</span> <span id="s420">My father used the phone for business.</span> <span id="s421">And if I had a date boys could call, and he'd say I'm busy, boom.</span> <span id="s422">And I remember threatening my father once.</span> <span id="s423">I said if you don't let me use the phone, I will call the phone company and tell them you're using it for business instead of, you know, a home phone.</span> <span id="s424">He looked at me like who the hell are you, you know?</span> <span id="s425">That's why I left.</span> <span id="s426">I was never home.</span> <span id="s427">And when Art moved into the houseboat, I was there most of the time.</span> <span id="s428">But my mother I remember when I of course my brother was in the service for a short time, and then he started college, too.</span> <span id="s429">But my mom taught was going to teach me how to drive.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: Your mother, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: Yeah, I never was close to my dad, my mother, yeah.</span> <span id="s432">And one day Eric's friend, Ted, who used to work on cars with him who lived on the street, saw us.</span> <span id="s433">And when Eric came home, he said I saw your sister.</span> <span id="s434">Your mom is teaching her to drive.</span> <span id="s435">Oh, he blew up.</span> <span id="s436">He told my mom in no uncertain terms that if you continue to teach Eleanor how to drive, I won't fix the cars anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s438">I missed it.</span> <span id="s439">Was it your brother who said this?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: My brother because he was the one who kept everything going.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: And he just wanted to be the one who is only allowed to drive?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: Yeah, he didn't want me to screw things up or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s444">I thought that you guys were really close.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: Well, we did</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: You and your brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: just for a while, when we were alone in England, but, no, Eric could do everything better than I could.</span> <span id="s448">And he was so anyway, I didn't learn how to drive until I had two children but, yeah, I have never forgiven him for that, to tell you the truth.</span> <span id="s449">I told his kids that.</span> <span id="s450">They couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s451">But he was kind of a difficult father when he raised his own kids, my brother was.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: Your brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: He has really mellowed now.</span> <span id="s454">But, yeah, very much like our father, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: Well, it's either like that or completely opposite, just like you are, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: Umhum.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: You said that you raised your children completely opposite.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s459">One of his daughters, he threw out of the house, my brother did.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: Umhum.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A: She came back.</span> <span id="s462">But she was into drugs and this stuff and had an abortion.</span> <span id="s463">No, I was a super mom, I was the girl scout leader, and the boy scout volunteer.</span> <span id="s464">And I volunteered for the all of the sports teams.</span> <span id="s465">And I went to every baseball game.</span> <span id="s466">And I was the room mother in school.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: In school, umhum.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: The PTA president.</span> <span id="s469">And I volunteered in the health clinic and all of that.</span> <span id="s470">But I thought my kids were the absolute most fantastic thing in the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: That's good.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: And see, you know, and my husband said he always resented the fact that the kids came first.</span> <span id="s473">And so I probably wasn't the greatest wife, but I said, yeah, I said, they didn't ask to be born, and my kids always came first.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: Did you ever confront your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: Yes, she denied everything.</span> <span id="s476">I tried, but it was hopeless.</span> <span id="s477">And since my father died so early, I would only make her unhappy.</span> <span id="s478">And she depended on me.</span> <span id="s479">And she adored my children, and she adored my husband after she learned to know him.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: That he could play bridge really well.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s482">And so by nine we got married in 1950, and those early years we lived way out.</span> <span id="s483">Oh, I we were both going to college when we were engaged, and I found a place he was busy.</span> <span id="s484">He was going to school, Art was, and he was working at Boeing on the fields.</span> <span id="s485">So he never had any time to look for an apartment or anything.</span> <span id="s486">I found an apartment.</span> <span id="s487">It was $55 a month.</span> <span id="s488">It was on the top floor of an old wooden building in Seattle.</span> <span id="s489">And I paid the rent for the first period.</span> <span id="s490">And I think we were pretty happy.</span> <span id="s491">What happened was I remember well, the Korean war broke out very shortly after we got married.</span> <span id="s492">And Art was in the Navy reserve.</span> <span id="s493">He's a Pearl Harbor survivor.</span> <span id="s494">I don't know if I mentioned that.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: No, you haven't.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: Yeah, Pearl Harbor survivor.</span> <span id="s497">Married a Holocaust survivor and Art I told him, I said, I don't want to be alone.</span> <span id="s498">I mean, here I was starting this new family in my new life, you know.</span> <span id="s499">And I was never happy as a child.</span> <span id="s500">And so we were pretty happy together.</span> <span id="s501">And I said I don't want to be alone.</span> <span id="s502">I want to get pregnant.</span> <span id="s503">And he said you're too young, and I said yeah, but you're not.</span> <span id="s504">He was 29.</span> <span id="s505">And so I did.</span> <span id="s506">I got pregnant on __.</span> <span id="s507">And so by that time, he graduated.</span> <span id="s508">And he transferred from being an inspector on the field to being engineer.</span> <span id="s509">He took a big wage cut.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: Cut?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: Cut in those days.</span> <span id="s512">Yeah.</span> <span id="s513">Quickly worked out but so I got pregnant.</span> <span id="s514">And I was still working at the hospital at that time because I could walk back and forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">And then Boeing his papers came.</span> <span id="s516">We knew being chief radarman in the navy, that he would be called back.</span> <span id="s517">And Boeing said we need him more than the Navy.</span> <span id="s518">So Art I remember saying well, I'm going to lose my reserve status and any benefits that I'll have.</span> <span id="s519">And I said I don't care.</span> <span id="s520">I'm not going to be alone here.</span> <span id="s521">You're not going in the service.</span> <span id="s522">And he didn't want to go anyway.</span> <span id="s523">So he left the reserves and worked as an engineer for Boeing for 38 years.</span> <span id="s524">And we lived in the third floor in that apartment.</span> <span id="s525">And I remember coming home on a very hot day in April.</span> <span id="s526">And I was huffing and puffing, trying to get up those stairs and I was exhausted.</span> <span id="s527">And Art was always working.</span> <span id="s528">And by that time Boeing was gearing up for the war.</span> <span id="s529">He was always working late.</span> <span id="s530">And I layed down on the bed exhausted, and my water broke.</span> <span id="s531">And I called my mom and she took me to the hospital and then finally Art came.</span> <span id="s532">And so Steve was born.</span> <span id="s533">And then I was I said I have worked all of my life and gone to school, one baby is not enough to keep me busy.</span> <span id="s534">I was bored.</span> <span id="s535">So I said I wanted another baby.</span> <span id="s536">And of course I said you're nuts, but okay.</span> <span id="s537">So we had another one, 22 months apart and just before while I was pregnant with the second one, some friend of ours found an apartment for us, which was a lower duplex in an area that was already pretty much going black, but not completely.</span> <span id="s538">And it was very reasonably priced.</span> <span id="s539">The lady just wanted some nice people on the lower floor.</span> <span id="s540">It was a big apartment.</span> <span id="s541">And we moved there and I didn't have to go three flights anymore.</span> <span id="s542">And we lived there very happily, and we had friends.</span> <span id="s543">And I remember that there was a really old lady who lived upstairs, and she was very nice.</span> <span id="s544">We didn't see her often.</span> <span id="s545">And while I was in the hospital having Brian, she died.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: Was this your second child, right, Brian?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s548">She died, and Art came to the hospital.</span> <span id="s549">In those days, you stayed in the hospital for several days, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: And so she wanted whitey oh, no, no, no, she sold it to black people, and she wanted whitey out right now.</span> <span id="s552">No, the black people wanted it.</span> <span id="s553">They didn't give us any time.</span> <span id="s554">And so my father I of course I couldn't drive with a brand new baby, but my oldest child would stay with my mother.</span> <span id="s555">I had the baby.</span> <span id="s556">And my father said we'll have to go house hunting.</span> <span id="s557">And by that time, we had been saving some money, and for a down payment you could get houses on the GI bill, and we drove way out, which was considered in those days really way out.</span> <span id="s558">And we found a house that I liked.</span> <span id="s559">And I came home and I told Art, and the next day he had off.</span> <span id="s560">We went out there.</span> <span id="s561">And there were houses that were upstairs and downstairs and all on one floor.</span> <span id="s562">Well, we didn't have enough money for the down payment for the one what do you call it, all on one floor.</span> <span id="s563">But we bought the one with an upstairs.</span> <span id="s564">It was fairly steep.</span> <span id="s565">And my father had a fit.</span> <span id="s566">By that time, you know, he says I had two little boys, and he said you can't have the upstairs, it will be hotter terribly hot in the summer, and the boys will fall down the stairs, you just can't do that.</span> <span id="s567">How why did you buy that?</span> <span id="s568">And so Art says well, we didn't have enough money for the all on one floor.</span> <span id="s569">How much do you need?</span> <span id="s570">And he gave us some money immediately.</span> <span id="s571">Go out and change it.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: Well, that was nice of him.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: Yes, go out and changed it.</span> <span id="s576">He adored my boys and he kind of mellowed over the years and so we went out and bought the one all on one floor.</span> <span id="s577">And my parents, they would like as my boys got older, they took them each at one one at a time on little trips to Mount Rinear or some lake or something for a little hike.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">And by that time Steve told me this recently, my father was already quite weak with his heart problem.</span> <span id="s579">And he said, he would sit on the bench somewhere while mom and my son would go hiking around.</span> <span id="s580">So he has those good memories, and so does Brian, but my daughter was younger, Audrey, and so Dad died in 1958.</span> <span id="s581">And the strange thing is that I had three children.</span> <span id="s582">And right after Dad died, I found out I was pregnant, and I was pretty upset.</span> <span id="s583">I didn't want to have anymore kids.</span> <span id="s584">But then all of a sudden I thought oh, maybe, you know, you get this crazy idea, maybe God meant for this child to make up for your dad dying.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: So because by that time we had moved to a bigger house and we had a dishwasher.</span> <span id="s587">And I had three children in school, and I got pregnant again, but I just I talked about abortion, but my mother my husband said absolutely no.</span> <span id="s588">So anyway I had JoDean, and she turned out to be the most wonderful little girl in the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: Is this the daughter that wasn't here?</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: No, she's the older daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: She's the older daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: JoDean is the one with all of the long hair there.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: She's the blond hair one, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: Well, she lightens it, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: So you have right now</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: Two boys and two girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: I have a photograph here, two boys and two girls, right, very good looking children.</span> <span id="s598">So it seems that your mother and father were actually better grandparents to your children than they were parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: Very much so.</span> <span id="s600">And I thought about that, and I actually kind of resented that, you know.</span> <span id="s601">And I thought they never were that close to me, you know.</span> <span id="s602">But I got over it.</span> <span id="s603">I didn't let it bother me too much because I was too busy having all of those kids, and after the war, you know, you had cooperative play groups, and I was always involved with the kids and baseball teams.</span> <span id="s604">And I went to all of the games.</span> <span id="s605">Four kids kept me plenty busy, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: I'm sure they did.</span> <span id="s607">I'm sure they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s609">So actually my father I felt he was pretty pathetic as he got older because he was a broken man.</span> <span id="s610">He lost his profession.</span> <span id="s611">He lost his station, his status in the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: And it was hard.</span> <span id="s614">I understand that now, but a young person thinks only of himself.</span> <span id="s615">So life just progressed and I oh, when I was in the hospital having Audrey, that's the one that was here, Art I remember there was a congregation, a reform congregation that was just starting up, and a lot of young couples with children.</span> <span id="s616">And Art came to the hospital and said now you're going we had talked about it.</span> <span id="s617">You're going to have to make up your mind.</span> <span id="s618">I was very ambivalent about Judaism, et cetera.</span> <span id="s619">And we had our Christmas tree still.</span> <span id="s620">And Art told me, he said if we're going to join this temple, I want to be one of the original members.</span> <span id="s621">And we have to do it right now because they're signing the charter.</span> <span id="s622">And I was I had just had Audrey.</span> <span id="s623">And I said okay, do what you want.</span> <span id="s624">And so we joined the temple and we were very active.</span> <span id="s625">It was a lovely time.</span> <span id="s626">Art taught Sunday school.</span> <span id="s627">And he didn't know a whole lot, but he learned fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: So he also didn't come from a religious family, you would say.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: Well, Art's father was he knew a lot, but he was one step ahead of the czar.</span> <span id="s630">And he came to the United States at the turn of the century.</span> <span id="s631">And there were five brothers.</span> <span id="s632">They had a stolen passport, and the story I got was the first one would come and send the passport back.</span> <span id="s633">And I found out many, many years after I married him that his family name was actually Polits (ph).</span> <span id="s634">And it came from somewhere in Poland originally, but he was in Russia, and he was a communist, very much so.</span> <span id="s635">But also they had programs and he was Jewish, and so they would send the passport back and forth.</span> <span id="s636">And the name on the passport was Rabalovitch (ph) which turned out to be Rafalovitch (ph) so when and they all stayed in the east whereas Art's father got on the railroad and worked his way west and settled into Tacoma, Washington, which is 30 miles from Seattle, and that's where Art grew up.</span> <span id="s637">And when I was not married yet, I was still engaged.</span> <span id="s638">At one time I went to see to Tacoma and Art's sister had done very well or husband was in the jewelry business, and they had quite a bit of money.</span> <span id="s639">And so Julia Rolfe from New York came to visit my sister in law.</span> <span id="s640">And she called me and you have to come and meet her.</span> <span id="s641">And I said Rolfe?</span> <span id="s642">And she said oh, yes, the New York part of the family all changed their name to Rolfe.</span> <span id="s643">And I said well, I don't want to be Rafalovitch (ph) I told Art.</span> <span id="s644">I said get your name changed.</span> <span id="s645">I want to you know, on your degree, he was still in school.</span> <span id="s646">And on our marriage license, we're going to be Rolfe.</span> <span id="s647">Art had never known there was a New York family.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s650">There were quite a few.</span> <span id="s651">And it's really interesting.</span> <span id="s652">But anyway, we changed our name to Rolfe.</span> <span id="s653">And my children are very happy.</span> <span id="s654">They would never have liked that name.</span> <span id="s655">Anyway it wasn't a family name.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: It's hard to spell, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: Rolfe is a nice name.</span> <span id="s658">But that's how we got that name, and it's an English name and people always ask are you related to so and so Rolfe?</span> <span id="s659">No.</span> <span id="s660">So that was done before we got married.</span> <span id="s661">And I was thinking of something, but the thought just left me.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q: Oh, we were talking about you becoming more religious, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s664">We joined the temple and Steve went to Sunday school and he came home.</span> <span id="s665">We joined the temple in May and that that December, Steve my son is very adamant.</span> <span id="s666">He gets that from his dad, I guess.</span> <span id="s667">He said we can't have a Christmas tree.</span> <span id="s668">That is making fun of Christian symbols.</span> <span id="s669">And Brian was really angry.</span> <span id="s670">He liked the Christmas tree.</span> <span id="s671">From that day on we didn't have a Christmas tree.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: Making fun of Christian symbols?</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: The Christmas tree?</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: You mean that this is a Pagan symbol after all, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s678">Well, how old was Steve?</span> <span id="s679">Was 19 the winter of 1956.</span> <span id="s680">He had just started religious school.</span> <span id="s681">And the teacher said, you know, we don't have Christmas trees so naturally I know that Brian resented that.</span> <span id="s682">And I know that when Brian got married they always had Christmas trees.</span> <span id="s683">But he didn't marry a Jewish person anyway.</span> <span id="s684">Steve what Steve said kind of was the law.</span> <span id="s685">So we were really Jewish.</span> <span id="s686">But I didn't have a background.</span> <span id="s687">So I didn't know all of the prayers and everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: Did you think that your parents also became more religious after they came to the states?</span> <span id="s689">I understand you said that you were helped a little bit in Seattle by a Jewish community.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s691">Well, the Jewish there were quite a few refugees coming everywhere, every city.</span> <span id="s692">All of the Jewish communities were helping.</span> <span id="s693">No, my father had no no use for religion at all.</span> <span id="s694">And, no, they never attended the temple, but they thought it was proper for me to go to Sunday school.</span> <span id="s695">But my brother about that time was was beyond the bar mitzvah age or just about that.</span> <span id="s696">And he wasn't about to get involved with that.</span> <span id="s697">So he was never made to go to Sunday school, only I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: And oh, my goodness, I think as I remember, we did have a Christmas tree in Seattle.</span> <span id="s700">And I think we used the Menorah also because we had this big we had both.</span> <span id="s701">But I don't remember very joyous Christmases.</span> <span id="s702">My mother was befriended by a lot of Quakers when we first came to the United States in Seattle.</span> <span id="s703">And there was one wonderful thing that I remembered to this day, the Quakers had on New Year's, they had New Year's callers.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: New Year's callers, what's that?</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: New Year's callers.</span> <span id="s706">And every New Year's a different family would host, and they usually had about five or six homes that were hosts.</span> <span id="s707">And the New Year's callers it was a fairly large group would go to all of them, one after another and talk and enjoy the new year and then go to the next New Year's callers.</span> <span id="s708">And I understand they do that in Canada today.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s710">I never heard of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A: It was very lovely.</span> <span id="s712">And my mother had these Quaker friends.</span> <span id="s713">She belonged to the "Jewish club of Washington," a bunch of German Jews.</span> <span id="s714">And every once in a while I would meet some of these people or I would go with her, and I vowed that I was never going to marry a German Jew</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: Why is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: I didn't like them.</span> <span id="s717">I don't know.</span> <span id="s718">It was very typical, children should be seen and not heard.</span> <span id="s719">Very arrogant.</span> <span id="s720">I mean, totally opposite of the way I looked at having children.</span> <span id="s721">I mean, they were the greatest things ever that I ever created.</span> <span id="s722">I thought they were just absolutely wonderful.</span> <span id="s723">And maybe it's because nobody ever thought I was wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">And so it's a really strange thing that Steve, when he got married he would didn't get married</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: Your older son, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: My oldest son, and he didn't marry a Jewish girl.</span> <span id="s727">But Gail wanted to go to Nova Scotia for a honeymoon.</span> <span id="s728">Don't ask me why.</span> <span id="s729">She just wanted to see Nova Scotia.</span> <span id="s730">So Gail came from Boston and so for their honeymoon trip, they visited her folks, of course, and they had a big wedding and her folks came and but anyway they went to Nova Scotia.</span> <span id="s731">And I don't know how I think I just lost my train of thought.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">End of File One</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Beginning File Two</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: Well, you were saying that you didn't like the German Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: No, I didn't.</span> <span id="s736">I didn't.</span> <span id="s737">My brother had no religious background to speak of.</span> <span id="s738">And so eventually he went to Reed College and then he got he went to Reed College, and then he had a scholarship to a program for government employment, political science up in upstate New York, and he had a full scholarship for that.</span> <span id="s739">And then he went to work for the federal government.</span> <span id="s740">And he ended up being deputy director of the Environmental Protection Agency.</span> <span id="s741">So he worked his way up very high in the government.</span> <span id="s742">And then when he retired he had two years of he had to sign a clause that he could not work in industry, that he represented the government, you know, for two years, a noncompetition clause because he was the one who put all the emission controls on our vehicles.</span> <span id="s743">And so he went to teach at Purdue University for two years and then he went to work for as a consultant for Mazda and Ford in their emission control.</span> <span id="s744">And, of course, my mother adored him.</span> <span id="s745">Somebody at the door?</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s747">There we go.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: Are you on?</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: Yeah, we are on.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: You asked me if I became a practicing Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: Well, you know, although I had no background in Judaism, I would do anything for my children and, yes, we joined the temple.</span> <span id="s753">She had just been born.</span> <span id="s754">And the boys went to religious school.</span> <span id="s755">And it was a great group.</span> <span id="s756">We were all young parents.</span> <span id="s757">And we had a lot of friends there.</span> <span id="s758">And we had parties, and it was good.</span> <span id="s759">And I learned to be Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: Did your mother ever go too?</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: No, I don't think she ever went with us to temple.</span> <span id="s762">My father was still alive.</span> <span id="s763">I have got that was 1956.</span> <span id="s764">And then Dad died in '58.</span> <span id="s765">And oh, about that time, we needed a bigger house again.</span> <span id="s766">And I remember being at a party and somebody said well, Ellie's moving and is she going to have a dishwasher?</span> <span id="s767">And I said would she be moving without a dishwasher?</span> <span id="s768">Because I didn't have one in my first home.</span> <span id="s769">And it was nice.</span> <span id="s770">Everybody had their own room.</span> <span id="s771">And it was a nice house.</span> <span id="s772">And then my mother, of course, she was a widow by then, and she took up skiing.</span> <span id="s773">And she went to she didn't ski very well, but she and her friends, they went to Sun Valley, and she fell in the pool.</span> <span id="s774">She told everybody it was on the hill, but she fell in the pool and she tore all of her I think she tore her ACL ligaments.</span> <span id="s775">And so she was in a cast, and so naturally she had to move in with us for quite a while until she was healed.</span> <span id="s776">And then we had to get her by that time, the house, the family house that I grew up in was completely surrounded by black folks.</span> <span id="s777">And it was a different time than now, you know.</span> <span id="s778">And it was difficult, so we insisted that Mom move.</span> <span id="s779">And we found her an apartment in the suburbs.</span> <span id="s780">And then as the years passed by, we had a nice time in the house we lived in.</span> <span id="s781">Lots of neighborhood parties.</span> <span id="s782">We had progressive dinners and I was very happy there.</span> <span id="s783">And we belonged to the temple.</span> <span id="s784">We belonged to a swim club.</span> <span id="s785">We had a good life.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: So you had a very good sense of community then.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Q: Really.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">A: Very good.</span> <span id="s790">And all of a sudden well, all of a sudden well, we oh, God, Art was started to travel, but Boeing in Seattle, we had a recession like now.</span> <span id="s791">And Boeing insisted that Art had to move to Alabama and because there were no jobs in Seattle.</span> <span id="s792">I remember there was a poster somebody put up, the last person that leaves Seattle, turn out the lights, yeah.</span> <span id="s793">So anyway I resisted, but I didn't have a choice.</span> <span id="s794">I mean I couldn't support four children.</span> <span id="s795">So we went to by that time I was very, very close to my mother.</span> <span id="s796">We all were.</span> <span id="s797">And so we moved to Alabama.</span> <span id="s798">And I remember Art had to go in January.</span> <span id="s799">He took one car, and he flew back.</span> <span id="s800">And we went in June after school was out.</span> <span id="s801">By that time we were all skiing a lot.</span> <span id="s802">And even JoDean who was really little, she turned out to be even today keeps up her accreditation as an instructor.</span> <span id="s803">I remember we drove I drove the kids to ski resorts while Art was in Alabama.</span> <span id="s804">And I had a white station wagon with bright red license plates, Alabama license plates.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q: Are they bright red still?</span></p> <p><span id="s806">A: I don't know if they're bright red still, but they were at that time.</span> <span id="s807">And people would look at that in the parking lot and say Alabama?</span> <span id="s808">I said when you live in Alabama, you got to go a long way to ski.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: Certainly.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: Well, you know, he could license the car and then we didn't have to buy two licenses.</span> <span id="s811">So instead of Washington, we bought Alabama.</span> <span id="s812">So then we went to Alabama.</span> <span id="s813">We drove, and we went by way of Disneyland and it was a pretty good trip.</span> <span id="s814">And along the way, we became more affluent.</span> <span id="s815">The kids the school were terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: In Alabama?</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s818">So I insisted on the kids going to private school.</span> <span id="s819">And I had I had argued with my husband about that, but you see my husband is was very, very intelligent and he did very well.</span> <span id="s820">He learned very well in public school because he just read all of the books they had, but anyway I won and unfortunately I would have had to send Steve to Birmingham because there was no private high school and I couldn't do that yet.</span> <span id="s821">There was no way I was going to send my son to a different city.</span> <span id="s822">And so the three younger ones went to this very, very good private school and it made a terrific difference.</span> <span id="s823">Even today my son, Brian, says that made me realize that I had some brains.</span> <span id="s824">And JoDean was born in November.</span> <span id="s825">And she used to say Phoebe gets to go to school.</span> <span id="s826">She called him Barney gets to go to school, Onnie (ph) gets to go to school.</span> <span id="s827">I never get to go to school.</span> <span id="s828">So there was no public kindergarten.</span> <span id="s829">And so at first I put her in a basket on my bike, and we went to all sorts of places, and we had a good time.</span> <span id="s830">I was alone most of the time in Alabama so because Art was working, in New Jersey.</span> <span id="s831">Boeing had a habit of doing that, but so I decided I started her in private kindergarten a year earlier.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">Q: Oh, you did start one, right, yourself?</span> <span id="s833">You started one yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A: No.</span> <span id="s835">It was there was no public kindergarten in Alabama.</span> <span id="s836">It was all private.</span> <span id="s837">So it was in a church and people said aren't you ashamed of lying in church, that she's actually five when she wasn't?</span> <span id="s838">And I said it doesn't matter to me whether I lied in church or anyplace else.</span> <span id="s839">So she oh, that was kind of interesting.</span> <span id="s840">The by the time we were in Huntsville, Alabama, all of the German scientists had come there.</span> <span id="s841">Wernher von Braun was living in Alabama and all of his cohorts.</span> <span id="s842">I found that very difficult.</span> <span id="s843">They were obnoxious.</span> <span id="s844">I remember going to the supermarket, and they talked very loud in German, and obviously that bothered me, but Wernher von Braun's daughter was at Randolph School, which I said it was a very, very good private school, and dated my son, I believe.</span> <span id="s845">They went to parties together once, yeah, just once.</span> <span id="s846">And, of course, he Brian didn't drive yet in those days.</span> <span id="s847">Brian has always been a social person.</span> <span id="s848">I remember I would drive him on dates and take him places and pick him up.</span> <span id="s849">But they were a lot of Germans in that school, weren't there?</span> <span id="s850">Umm?</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q: __+dating?</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: Oh, I had a fit probably, yeah.</span> <span id="s853">Can you imagine?</span> <span id="s854">But you know the American government brought all of those people to our country, yeah.</span> <span id="s855">And that's where Redstone Arsenal is.</span> <span id="s856">I always felt that they brought us they could have done this in other parts of the country, but they brought us northerners to the south to integrate the south.</span> <span id="s857">I always felt that.</span> <span id="s858">We were being used to integrate the south.</span> <span id="s859">It was a difficult time.</span> <span id="s860">I remember that Brian no, Steve had to go to public high school.</span> <span id="s861">He was in the band.</span> <span id="s862">And the band was invited to go to play for Lurleen Wallace's inauguration at what's the name of the city, Audrey?</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Audrey: __</span></p> <p><span id="s864">A: No, no, in the coast.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">Audrey: Mobile.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">A: Huh huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">Audrey: Mobile.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">A: No.</span> <span id="s869">I'll think of it, but anyway wherever they were</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Audrey: Montgomery.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">A: Montgomery.</span> <span id="s872">They were going to Montgomery and the Huntsville High School band was going to play at Lurleen Wallace's inauguration.</span> <span id="s873">Now, this woman was running for governor because her previous the previous governor was her husband and he couldn't run anymore, you know, only so many terms.</span> <span id="s874">Well, they get on a bus and Steve comes from the west.</span> <span id="s875">He really we never found any anti Semitism in the west.</span> <span id="s876">I was the one who came from that background, but not my children.</span> <span id="s877">They started out and nobody would let them go to the bathroom.</span> <span id="s878">I mean, the Huntsville High School band was mostly black.</span> <span id="s879">It was integrated.</span> <span id="s880">And that was integrated and that was our schools that was the government, city, you know?</span> <span id="s881">So Steve said that he learned a lot about discrimination.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">Q: Really.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">A: Interesting.</span> <span id="s884">And so he never really felt any discrimination as a Jew growing up because we lived in the west.</span> <span id="s885">And I'm sure that the people you see my father refused to stay in New York because he wanted to he was going be an immigrant, he wasn't going to be in New York with all of those other Jews.</span> <span id="s886">So we were assimilated and he it was difficult.</span> <span id="s887">When they got to Montgomery, they wouldn't even seat them.</span> <span id="s888">And so the bus turned around and came back to Huntsville.</span> <span id="s889">That was a good lesson for Steve.</span> <span id="s890">Unbelievable, though difficult times.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">Q: Yeah, I can difficult times.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">A: Yeah, I mean</span></p> <p><span id="s893">Audrey: 1966.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">A: Yeah, that was it's really interesting.</span> <span id="s895">I just recently saw films about that, you know, they turned the hose on black kids that tried to go to school.</span> <span id="s896">It was awful.</span> <span id="s897">I hated Huntsville.</span> <span id="s898">My mother came all the time.</span> <span id="s899">We were close to my mother in those I mean she the most important thing in my mother's life was her children, her grandchildren so</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Q: People change.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s902">I kind of resented that, but that's the way it was.</span> <span id="s903">So when we lived when we first came to Huntsville, We lived in an apartment.</span> <span id="s904">We had to build a house.</span> <span id="s905">There wasn't anything there and there were three bedrooms, a bedroom for Art and me, bedroom for the boys, and a bedroom for the girls, and Paula came home.</span> <span id="s906">And so we had to walk over beds, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">Q: __.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s909">She adored my children, you know.</span> <span id="s910">Interesting, isn't it?</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q: It is interesting, but people do change.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">A: People change, yes.</span> <span id="s913">So I have always kind of felt like I was in the outside looking in when I was supposed to be Jewish, I wasn't Jewish enough.</span> <span id="s914">I didn't have the right clothes.</span> <span id="s915">When we came to Seattle, the council of Jewish women, there were a number you know immigrants came west.</span> <span id="s916">And they had a big dinner for us, for the new immigrants.</span> <span id="s917">And I remember long tables at this temple.</span> <span id="s918">And we went there and they the table decorations were little figures like from Fiddler On The Roof.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">Q: Umhum.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">A: In those kind of clothes.</span> <span id="s921">My brother who was typically arrogant, like his father, took one look at those and, you know, depicting immigrants and thinking oh, he says we're not staying.</span> <span id="s922">He was just so angry.</span> <span id="s923">I remember that.</span> <span id="s924">And my father looked at that, and then he realized that Eric said, no, I can't look at those figures, and we left.</span> <span id="s925">But in those days, there was people always discriminated against each other.</span> <span id="s926">And there was a large population of Jews from the Isle of Rose.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">Q: I'm not sure where that is.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">A: Spanish Jews, Sephardic Jews, very large Sephardic Jews that came in the early part of the 1900s and it was large.</span> <span id="s929">And in those days if the Ashkenazic Jews, they discriminated against the Sephardic Jews.</span> <span id="s930">I remember the very first I heard a family actually would sit shiva if their daughter or son married a Sepharic Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A: And the concept of discrimination, this was just unbelievable in my mind.</span> <span id="s933">So at one time the first year my brother was at the University of Washington he transferred the second year to Reed College.</span> <span id="s934">He was, of course, on the newspaper staff.</span> <span id="s935">And he wrote an article.</span> <span id="s936">Race relations were terrible in the '60s.</span> <span id="s937">He wrote an article in the University of Washington Daily.</span> <span id="s938">And he wrote that I think I still have the article in a file that the only hope for peace and happiness was between the races and to get rid of this animosity for complete mingling of the races, intermarriage.</span> <span id="s939">Oh, my God.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">Q: I'm sure that</span></p> <p><span id="s941">A: Signed by Eric Stark (ph).</span> <span id="s942">Our phone never stopped ringing.</span> <span id="s943">My parents said how can you write that?</span> <span id="s944">Oh, my gosh.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: I'm sure that was a bit controversial.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: Very controversial.</span> <span id="s947">Yes.</span> <span id="s948">And then after my parents got used to my marrying something of Russian background, and they loved Art because he's a wonderful man.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">Q: Is that his full name, Art?</span></p> <p><span id="s950">A: Arthur.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">Q: Arthur.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A: Arthur.</span> <span id="s953">And he doesn't have a middle name.</span> <span id="s954">They didn't bother with middle names in those days.</span> <span id="s955">Yeah, Arthur.</span> <span id="s956">And what was I going to say?</span></p> <p><span id="s957">Q: You were saying that they got used to him being a Russian Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s959">In 1952 I got married in '50.</span> <span id="s960">In 1952, Art met Dorothy, and we heard about his girlfriend, that turned out to be a finaceé.</span> <span id="s961">He lived here in Washington D.C.</span> <span id="s962">He was working for the government.</span> <span id="s963">And he would he told my mother none of us went to the wedding.</span> <span id="s964">Dorothy is part American Indian.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">Q: Umhum.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A: She's a wonderful woman.</span> <span id="s967">And my mother told me don't you ever, ever tell anybody that Dorothy has American Indian heritage.</span> <span id="s968">I think her father was white.</span> <span id="s969">The mother was, you know she came from a family of 13 children.</span> <span id="s970">And my brother was at that time he had moved to the Department of Indian affairs.</span> <span id="s971">She was a secretary there.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Q: So I'm sorry because I think I missed it.</span> <span id="s973">So this is your brother who met her, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s974">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s975">And, you know, I told you that my parents discriminated against my husband because he had a Russian background, and then the idea that my brother would marry somebody American Indian.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">A: Of course everybody loved each other in the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s979">It's just an initial obstacle.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">Q: Different upbringing I'm sure, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">Q: Do you think that the fact that you were the Kindertransport child, did this do you think that had any influence on your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s984">A: What is that noise?</span></p> <p><span id="s985">Q: I am afraid that apparently somebody is having a speech.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">A: Oh, oh.</span> <span id="s987">They're applauding.</span> <span id="s988">I think so.</span> <span id="s989">I was alone.</span> <span id="s990">I was alone at the age of 8.</span> <span id="s991">And I went to a foreign country where I didn't know the language.</span> <span id="s992">And then when I got to the school, I was kind of discriminated against because they found out I had parents that were alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">Q: And who also could send you the packages?</span></p> <p><span id="s994">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s995">And I think from that I was always alone and being, yeah, I was used to being alone and little.</span> <span id="s996">I was always small.</span> <span id="s997">And some people made lifelong friends when they were in England.</span> <span id="s998">I did not.</span> <span id="s999">No.</span> <span id="s1000">I think about it.</span> <span id="s1001">And when at first, they talked about survivors.</span> <span id="s1002">I never thought of myself as a survivor, you know, because I wasn't in a camp, but then they said, you know, we are.</span> <span id="s1003">Like I said, I talked to the lady who made the film, my knees were jumping.</span> <span id="s1004">That film was shown in the Seattle Jewish film festival 12 years ago.</span> <span id="s1005">I told Melissa that.</span> <span id="s1006">And she remembered that.</span> <span id="s1007">It was shown in a large auditorium.</span> <span id="s1008">And I had read in the newspaper it was going to be shown.</span> <span id="s1009">And I told Art, we got to go.</span> <span id="s1010">And we went.</span> <span id="s1011">Have you ever seen that film?</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">Q: No, I haven't seen that one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">A: In one of the pictures, it was a string of girls dancing and I said, Art, there's __.</span> <span id="s1014">He says, yeah, because my father had taken so many pictures.</span> <span id="s1015">He was, you know, a photographer.</span> <span id="s1016">I mean, he took pictures of everything.</span> <span id="s1017">And so we had a lot of pictures of me as a little girl.</span> <span id="s1018">So Millis Hacker (ph) asked if there was anybody in the audience who came on the Kindertransport.</span> <span id="s1019">And I raised my hand.</span> <span id="s1020">And I was the only one.</span> <span id="s1021">And afterwards I ran down because we were quite a ways up.</span> <span id="s1022">And I talked to her.</span> <span id="s1023">And she told me about KTA.</span> <span id="s1024">I had no idea.</span> <span id="s1025">Living in the west I had no idea there was an organization I didn't have any Jewish connections except the temple.</span> <span id="s1026">And so Melissa told me about the international KTA Association.</span> <span id="s1027">And she took my name.</span> <span id="s1028">And within a week or so, I got stuff in the mail from Kindertransport.</span> <span id="s1029">Now there was no Kindertransport group in Seattle, but there was it's a group of child survivors, you know.</span> <span id="s1030">I got to go to the bathroom.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">Q: Oh, let's pause.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">A: Are you done?</span> <span id="s1033">{Recess} Yeah, my father, when I moved when my mother died, we moved boxes and boxes of papers to our house.</span> <span id="s1034">And when we downsized two years ago to a retirement community, I started going through all of our papers and one my son in law, Audrey's husband, is very interested in that.</span> <span id="s1035">And he sometimes comes from Colorado and he goes through stuff.</span> <span id="s1036">He finds it amazing.</span> <span id="s1037">And my grandson one grandson is living in Freiburg, Germany and he graduated with three degrees from my family has done very well in the United States, very well.</span> <span id="s1038">My brother was high up in the American government, and his daughter one daughter was in charge of communications for the Library of Congress.</span> <span id="s1039">She was head of that.</span> <span id="s1040">And the other one is involved with her husband in contracting and has done very well.</span> <span id="s1041">And so my oldest grandson is a geophysicist, and an amazing person.</span> <span id="s1042">And they're lovely children.</span> <span id="s1043">I was with my daughter every time she had a baby, and so I'm close to her boys.</span> <span id="s1044">And the middle one graduated with a degree in German and applied physics and in math from Trinity University where he had a full scholarship.</span> <span id="s1045">And now he is in Freiburg working on his master's.</span> <span id="s1046">And the younger one, like I said, is at American University, and my daughter just went to pick him up at the metro station.</span> <span id="s1047">They'll be here shortly.</span> <span id="s1048">So but anyway, my son in law and Mark have been going through my father's papers.</span> <span id="s1049">He worked trying to get other people who were stranded in different countries to get them in the United States.</span> <span id="s1050">They were in Borneo.</span> <span id="s1051">I don't know where all, you know.</span> <span id="s1052">And I have all of those letters.</span> <span id="s1053">He actually contacted somebody from Sear's Roebuck who apparently had some connection somewhere because I found letters from them where he asked for money, and they always gave it to him to send to these people to get them into the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q: Our museum might be interested in such papers if you would be willing to share.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1056">I have to check.</span> <span id="s1057">Now, Mark just made copies.</span> <span id="s1058">I have a what do you call it?</span> <span id="s1059">It's actually a book written on __+ typed, and very close together.</span> <span id="s1060">And it's my cousin living underground with her husband in Belgium.</span> <span id="s1061">And it's written in German, so I my German isn't good enough for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">Q: Uh huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">A: And I have that and unfortunately I didn't check to find out if she was alive until after she died.</span> <span id="s1064">And they eventually came to the United States, settled in Florida, and were in the antique business and died in the very late '80s.</span> <span id="s1065">And at that time I was too busy raising kids, and I never really thought of looking into it, but I have her book that she wrote.</span> <span id="s1066">And I have interesting stuff.</span> <span id="s1067">I don't know if anybody would be interested in photo albums.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">Q: I'm sure they will.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">A: My parents did a lot of mountain childing.</span> <span id="s1070">And Mom told me about when they went to Pompeii for a trip, the guide said the woman cab looked down there but, yeah.</span> <span id="s1071">I have since traveled some.</span> <span id="s1072">And it happened that you asked me about my Uncle Walter, he was sent then to Amsterdam to be with all of the other Itingers (ph) that had moved to Amsterdam, and when the news came that they would all be deported and sent to Westerbork, one of the uncles or something sent realized that Walter would never survive if they were sent to a concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">A: And so he had some money, and he looked for someone who would take him in and shield him.</span> <span id="s1075">And so there was an actress unfortunately, I don't have these names anymore in my mind, but anyway in the last many years I spent a lot of time going back and forth to Holland because what happened was the money was given to Audrey may be able to get the name.</span> <span id="s1076">I can't seem to get the name into my mind.</span> <span id="s1077">It will come back.</span> <span id="s1078">And he was at that time a very young man.</span> <span id="s1079">He became a famous movie producer in Holland.</span> <span id="s1080">And what he did was he took the money and killed my uncle and threw him in the canal in a in a suitcase.</span> <span id="s1081">And they found him and the it's an interesting story.</span> <span id="s1082">The first policeman on the case, on the scene, was a part of the resistance movement, and he would go out in the fields.</span> <span id="s1083">And I met all of these people in Holland because they're not Jews.</span> <span id="s1084">And before this grandfather died, I did meet him.</span> <span id="s1085">And he would pick up the weapons that the British dropped out in the fields.</span> <span id="s1086">And he would pick them up and put them underneath the baby carriage with the baby on top and bring them to the priest who was collecting weapons.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">A: Really trying to get a resistance going, but it didn't work, of course, but so he was aware of he was a first he was a policeman in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s1089">And he was the first one on the scene.</span> <span id="s1090">And he always knew that Walter was murdered.</span> <span id="s1091">And anyway, he tried very hard to get this man convicted, and he just spent maybe a few months of jail, and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">Q: That was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">A: Well, the baby in the baby carriage was told that, you know, you have to follow up on this case.</span> <span id="s1094">And I have a book about it.</span> <span id="s1095">It's all in Dutch though.</span> <span id="s1096">And you have to bring him to justice.</span> <span id="s1097">And so she eventually died of cancer.</span> <span id="s1098">And as she was dying in the last days, she told her son, Peter, that you have to follow this up for me and work on it.</span> <span id="s1099">And I guess it was something the whole family always knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Well, Peter Crowson then started his search and he he's an archivist in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s1101">He has now been promoted.</span> <span id="s1102">He is now the head archivist in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s1103">But at that time, there were some writers who were looking into this murder also.</span> <span id="s1104">It made a hell of a good story.</span> <span id="s1105">And so this author apparently came to the archives and talked to Peter and wanted some information.</span> <span id="s1106">And eventually they got together and he convinced Peter, although it was difficult for him because it would have been he could have gotten fired, but anyway to join him in this search and</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">Q: Would you remind me who Peter was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">A: Peter was just the son of this lady who was in the baby carriage.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">A: It was just passed down generations.</span> <span id="s1111">And it was something that they wanted to unfortunately like I can't remember the name of the</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">Q: That's not a problem.</span> <span id="s1113">You can maybe</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">A: But he is a very famous man in Amsterdam who just threw recently has been discredited because he not only killed my uncle, he killed others.</span> <span id="s1115">And he told Jews I'll take care of your property and your money.</span> <span id="s1116">And when you come back, you can have it.</span> <span id="s1117">Those that came back, never heard of you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">A: He was a crook.</span> <span id="s1120">But anyway, he even tried to get a pension as a resistance person.</span> <span id="s1121">And, of course, he was never he was turned down, and he sued people.</span> <span id="s1122">And Peter is the man who finally he couldn't get anymore information about Walter and his family.</span> <span id="s1123">So he searched the Internet.</span> <span id="s1124">And he searched the name Itinger (ph) which is my mother's maiden name.</span> <span id="s1125">And there were lots of Itingers (ph) because it's a Catholic name.</span> <span id="s1126">So a lot of people said, never heard of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">One person, and it was my cousin's daughter who was working as a journalist in the Colorado mountains for a local newspaper, responded to him and said I think I know what you're talking about.</span> <span id="s1128">She called her dad.</span> <span id="s1129">And her dad called me.</span> <span id="s1130">And it was coincidental that was in January of 1901.</span> <span id="s1131">And I had made I was invited to go back to Hamburg, you know, in the visitation program.</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">Q: 1901?</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">A: Excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">Q: 2001, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">A: 2001.</span> <span id="s1136">And then I went to Hamburgh, and I had told Audrey they let me bring somebody and I wanted you to come because Art said that he what was the purpose of him learning all of this?</span> <span id="s1137">Audrey will share it with the family, you know.</span> <span id="s1138">Pass it down, besides Audrey and I have always been close.</span> <span id="s1139">And I didn't have the greatest marriage.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">Q: Can you excuse me for a second?</span> <span id="s1141">I just remembered that I need to __+ yes.</span> <span id="s1142">{ Recess } Let's record.</span> <span id="s1143">There we go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">A: I'd like to share this with someone from the Holocaust center eventually because it's an interesting story.</span> <span id="s1145">They traced us, and my cousin, Peter, actually forbade me to go see these people.</span> <span id="s1146">He said what do they want from us?</span> <span id="s1147">Do they want money?</span> <span id="s1148">He was always suspicious.</span> <span id="s1149">Well, Peter Crowson is a man who I had a gut feeling that he was honest.</span> <span id="s1150">He wrote to me many, many e mail letters.</span> <span id="s1151">And so we were in Hamburgh.</span> <span id="s1152">And I agreed for him to come and meet us.</span> <span id="s1153">And he was going to drive to Hamburgh with his Arthur friend, and they were going to drive us back to Amsterdam and actually he invited us to stay with him.</span> <span id="s1154">My cousin, Peter, was livid and he said you can't do this.</span> <span id="s1155">And I'm like don't tell me what to do, but anyway this was amazing.</span> <span id="s1156">So since 2001 over the years we've gotten to know the person.</span> <span id="s1157">And I've done many trips back to Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s1158">And Audrey has come with me on a couple.</span> <span id="s1159">My one grandson was studying in Delft, which is right next to Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s1160">And it's become a home away from home.</span> <span id="s1161">It's just amazing.</span> <span id="s1162">And we actually got this man convicted.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">Q: Oh, very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1165">Actually well, he's very old now, but what we tried to do was clear the record so that people would know what an awful person he was.</span> <span id="s1166">He said he was a resistance helper.</span> <span id="s1167">He never was.</span> <span id="s1168">He took money from Jews before they were sent to the camps and said he would save it for them and, of course, he never got it back.</span> <span id="s1169">Artwork he actually to this day is living in a home that came from a wealthy Jew And my daughter will probably remember.</span> <span id="s1170">For some reason I have a total block now.</span> <span id="s1171">But I have talked to authors and journalists in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s1172">And we've communicated and it took us a long time.</span> <span id="s1173">Peter, who is when we write to Peter and his wife now, like I said, they're like family because they I told him my Aaron is coming to Delft, and you're going to love him, and like Peter didn't tell me at the time.</span> <span id="s1174">He said what does she think, I'm going to love this American kid?</span> <span id="s1175">And then afterwards, you know, Ellie, you're right, I love Aaron.</span> <span id="s1176">They're so close.</span> <span id="s1177">So Peter, they had a baby.</span> <span id="s1178">I met them long before she was even pregnant.</span> <span id="s1179">And Aurora is six now and their little girl is called Aurora.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">Q: Whose child is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">A: Peter's.</span> <span id="s1182">And I had invited them because I've stayed with them so often in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s1183">And I said you got to come to America.</span> <span id="s1184">And so they came in July.</span> <span id="s1185">And they came and they spent a week with Audrey in Colorado.</span> <span id="s1186">And they came and spent a week with me in Seattle in Bellevue.</span> <span id="s1187">Then they went down to Huntington Beach which is very close to Disneyland.</span> <span id="s1188">And they spent a week with my son, Brian.</span> <span id="s1189">And he drove them back and forth.</span> <span
