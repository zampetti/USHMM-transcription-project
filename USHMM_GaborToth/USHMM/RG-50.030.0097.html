My father was, uh, an employee in an insurance company.</span> <span id="s43">We were middle-class, comfortable.</span> <span id="s44">There were no signs of overt antisemitism there.</span> <span id="s45">There was antisemitism but it was kept more or less under the surface; and especially in the main part of Yugoslavia--in Serbia--there was no anti-semitism, because the Jews embraced the idea of Yugoslavia rather than separate nations.</span> <span id="s46">And so there was no government-sponsored antisemitism.</span> <span id="s47">However, a Jew could not become a professor in the university, or get a government position or a high government position.</span> <span id="s48">This was understood.</span> <span id="s49">Unless you're baptized himself or herself.</span> <span id="s50">But otherwise, we were left alone.</span> <span id="s51">There was inter-marriage, and there were friendships with the, uh, gentiles.</span> <span id="s52">It was quite a comfortable life for the middle-class.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: What kind of a schooling did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: I went to the Jewish elementary school.</span> <span id="s55">We had in those days four years of elementary education which was sectarian.</span> <span id="s56">So I went to the Jewish elementary school and then it was followed by eight years of high school, of European high school.</span> <span id="s57">I only finished six, because the war came.</span> <span id="s58">The Germans attacked when I was just finishing the sixth...uh, sixth year or sixth grade.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: What was that high school like?</span> <span id="s60">This was a secular high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: This was a secular high school, which had a very strict, fixed curriculum embracing all fields of science, at least three languages, uh, including Latin.</span> <span id="s62">There was Latin, French and German were obligatory, besides Serbo-Croatian.</span> <span id="s63">Religion was taught in separate classes to the Jews, the Catholics, the Moslems, the Orthodox, and so on.</span> <span id="s64">So religion was actually the main subject; and if you didn't pass religion, you didn't pass that whole year.</span> <span id="s65">It was typical European, the educational system.</span> <span id="s66">No mercy, no promotion--unless you really passed.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: Did you enjoy it?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: Yes, I..</span> <span id="s69">.</span> <span id="s70">I enjoyed it; because I..</span> <span id="s71">.</span> <span id="s72">I was lucky.</span> <span id="s73">I was a good student, so it wasn't too difficult for me.</span> <span id="s74">But this wasn't really a public education where everybody participated, like in the United States.</span> <span id="s75">Most of the population did not participate in this type of high school.</span> <span id="s76">Uh, there was a high rate of illiteracy, and, uh, education was not at all wide-spread in Yugoslavia of those days.</span> <span id="s77">So this was somewhat of an elite group that went to this type of high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: You talked about there not being official antisemitism but that antisemitism was sort of felt.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Did you encounter any such incidents when you were growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: I really didn't encounter any incident, except in sometimes perhaps a remark, uh, by a teacher who would meet us Jewish children going to our religion class, to another classroom.</span> <span id="s81">He would say something.</span> <span id="s82">"Here come the chosen people."</span> <span id="s83">It was sort of sarcastic, but it was...it was that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s84">Or, uh, if, uh, in the streets sometimes children would shout, "Jew, go to Palestine," and so on.</span> <span id="s85">But I personally did not encounter any strong antisemitic, uh, incident.</span> <span id="s86">However, there was at least one group, and it's the main group.</span> <span id="s87">There was a political party, underground, a fascist party which was antisemitic.</span> <span id="s88">And they did write graffiti and publish slogans, and so on.</span> <span id="s89">And they were the Croatian Nationalist Separatists, who didn't want Yugoslavia at all.</span> <span id="s90">They wanted independent Croatia, Catholic Croatia; and they were fiercely antisemitic.</span> <span id="s91">But they lived mostly in exile.</span> <span id="s92">In the inter-war years, they lived in Italy and Germany--which countries gave them asylum hoping that someday, as it happened, they could bring them back into Yugoslavia and install them in this Croatian state, which would then be a satellite of the Axis powers.</span> <span id="s93">So there was always the underground; and it's a feeling of impending antisemitic, uh, doom.</span> <span id="s94">But in everyday life, it wasn't felt as much as it might have been in other parts of Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: What happened when the war broke out?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: When the war broke out in 1939, Yugoslavia was neutral.</span> <span id="s97">And uh, in 1940 Italy attacked Greece, and could not achieve a victory there.</span> <span id="s98">Germany wanted Greece out of the way.</span> <span id="s99">In fact, Germany wanted the Balkans secured; because Germany planned to attack the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s100">The Germans pressured the Yugoslav government of the time to let German troops go through Yugoslavia, so that they can then attack Greece.</span> <span id="s101">The Yugoslav government agreed, but there was a coup which overthrew that government.</span> <span id="s102">This was in Serbia.</span> <span id="s103">An anti- Fascist, anti-Nazi coup; and they installed a new government which was openly anti- German.</span> <span id="s104">It was in defiance, direct defiance of Hitler.</span> <span id="s105">And in response to that, in April 1941, he ordered that Yugoslavia be attacked.</span> <span id="s106">Germany and Italy and Hungary and Bulgaria all attacked Yugoslavia, and defeated its army in about fourteen days.</span> <span id="s107">And that Croatian state was then established under the name the "Independent State of Croatia."</span> <span id="s108">And the exiled nationalists, antisemites, came back to govern that state.</span> <span id="s109">They called themselves "Ustaša."</span> <span id="s110">That means, uh, "Men of the Uprising."</span> <span id="s111">And immediately, within the first week, they began to introduce anti-Jewish legislation.</span> <span id="s112">Not only Jews, but also the Serbs.</span> <span id="s113">Orthodox Serbs were really on their list of destruction.</span> <span id="s114">And Gypsies.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: Tell us what was in that legislation and how did it affect you?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: The legislation was sweeping.</span> <span id="s117">The Jews, there was a curfew.</span> <span id="s118">The Jews had to wear a yellow, uh, piece of cloth on the shoulder and in the back with the, uh, word, with the initial for "Jew" in Yugoslav.</span> <span id="s119">They were, of course, thrown out of all jobs; and even out of apartments in a certain section of the city.</span> <span id="s120">They had to surrender cameras, radios, and so on.</span> <span id="s121">It was a preliminary, it was a set of measures to isolate the Jews and completely, uh, cow the Jewish population into numbness.</span> <span id="s122">Because it was very sudden.</span> <span id="s123">Almost upon arrival of these...of the Ustaša.</span> <span id="s124">And, selectively, they took certain groups--such as some lawyers--and executed them as being Communists.</span> <span id="s125">And they began some deportations.</span> <span id="s126">There...those were times, they were somewhat chaotic.</span> <span id="s127">I mean, it was a new state.</span> <span id="s128">There was chaos.</span> <span id="s129">The Ustaša were not that organized.</span> <span id="s130">There was a struggle between the Germans and Italians, diplomatic struggle, for the control of that state.</span> <span id="s131">And the Germans won that control.</span> <span id="s132">The Italians, who had banked on that, lost even though the Italians also got a piece of Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s133">In other words, it is important to understand that after the victory over Yugoslavia, the Axis powers dismembered Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s134">There was no more Yugoslavia as a state.</span> <span id="s135">There was the Independent State of Croatia; Serbia was occupied by Germany; western Yugoslavia--that is, Slovenia--was divided between the Germans and Italians.</span> <span id="s136">And most important, for my story, the Italians occupied that Adriatic coast of Yugoslavia and most of the islands.</span> <span id="s137">They also annexed part of that coast--the best part, the richest for tourism--Dalmatia, and made it part of Italy.</span> <span id="s138">So that was the situation.</span> <span id="s139">The Jews in Croatia [were] being slowly herded together, and taken to various camps.</span> <span id="s140">At one time, there were some thirteen or fourteen camps operating in Croatia.</span> <span id="s141">The Germans were not in these camps.</span> <span id="s142">This was all...they were all run by the Ustaša.</span> <span id="s143">The, uh, savagerity that was practiced in these camps was such that even the Germans were horrified.</span> <span id="s144">In their internal memoranda, they called it the "Balkan bestiality."</span> <span id="s145">At one point--I don't remember the exact date, in July that same year--a transport was being formed.</span> <span id="s146">In other words, again Jews were being arrested, to be transported to an island where they all perished.</span> <span id="s147">I was arrested on a certain day.</span> <span id="s148">And I was then sixteen at the time.</span> <span id="s149">The agent detective who came to arrest me, the Croatian, had my name on his list and not my father's name.</span> <span id="s150">This was unusual.</span> <span id="s151">And my father protested and said that it must be a mistake.</span> <span id="s152">He wanted to substitute himself for me, saying that "You probably mean me, and not my son."</span> <span id="s153">The detective insisted, "No, it says Ivo Herzer and I have to take him."</span> <span id="s154">So my father said, "Well, I'll come with you."</span> <span id="s155">Of course, he couldn't go into that transitory camp; and so I was taken there.</span> <span id="s156">This was on the outskirts of the city of Zagreb, where fairs were held usually.</span> <span id="s157">And there were several hundred Jewish families with babies, complete families, pushed against the wall.</span> <span id="s158">And machine guns--heavy machine guns--were manned by the Ustaša, aimed at this mass of Jews who were...we had to respond to a roll call about every hour.</span> <span id="s159">We didn't know at all what would happen.</span> <span id="s160">Now we know what happened to that transport.</span> <span id="s161">As I said, they were taken to the island of Pag, P - A - G; and they all perished there under horrible circumstances.</span> <span id="s162">I was just lucky; because during the evening roll call, when my name came up, the Ustaša officer in charge said, "Are you here alone?"</span> <span id="s163">Since they had families.</span> <span id="s164">I said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s165">He said, "Take your things and go home."</span> <span id="s166">Just like that.</span> <span id="s167">He could have easily said, "Bring his family."</span> <span id="s168">He didn't.</span> <span id="s169">Now this was past curfew time.</span> <span id="s170">I had no paper in my hand to prove that I had a right to be anywhere.</span> <span id="s171">And so I ran home; and I wasn't...no patrol found me.</span> <span id="s172">I was lucky.</span> <span id="s173">And my parents thought they had lost me already.</span> <span id="s174">And they couldn't believe their eyes when I just burst in upon them.</span> <span id="s175">It was then that my parents decided that we must do something.</span> <span id="s176">Try to escape.</span> <span id="s177">But escape where?</span> <span id="s178">The partisans were not yet active.</span> <span id="s179">Yugoslavia was surrounded by countries that were already under German domination.</span> <span id="s180">How could we, ordinary middle-class people, escape?</span> <span id="s181">And then the decision was made.</span> <span id="s182">Let us try to somehow escape to the Italian zone in Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s183">Maybe the Italians will let us in.</span> <span id="s184">Maybe they're not as bad as the Germans.</span> <span id="s185">Because we didn't really know anything about Fascist Italy.</span> <span id="s186">Since the Jewish community in Zagreb was oriented toward Austria and the German-speaking Europe, Italy was the place to go for a vacation maybe.</span> <span id="s187">But the fundamental difference between Fascism and Nazism, as far as Jews were concerned, was unknown to us.</span> <span id="s188">To us, this was a gamble.</span> <span id="s189">And my father obtained some sort of pass which could be gotten for some money.</span> <span id="s190">It was just a pass that said that we could be let out of Croatia, but didn't guarantee any entry anywhere.</span> <span id="s191">With this pass, without the yellow signs--which was a great risk--we left in July 1941 by train for the border.</span> <span id="s192">We wanted to go actually to the city of Split--Spalato, in Italian--which then was in Dalmatia, which then became Italy.</span> <span id="s193">And we thought if we reached that city somehow, as many Jews did, we would be safe--provided the Italians don't turn us back.</span> <span id="s194">On the way to Spalato, however, some troubles developed to the railroad.</span> <span id="s195">It seems that some guerillas must have blown up the tracks.</span> <span id="s196">The train was turned back; and we landed in a city which was the worst place to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">And this was the city of the Croatian Nationalists, where the Ustaša movement was born--the city of Gospi_--in a desolate part of the country with curfews, patrols, and a concentration camp for Jews just outside of Gospi_.</span> <span id="s198">We didn't know that, but there it was.</span> <span id="s199">The three of us, plus perhaps six or seven other Jews whom we knew who tried to do the same thing, we coalesced into a small group, milling around at the station and then trying to go into town.</span> <span id="s200">It's a small town.</span> <span id="s201">On the way, we just knocked on a door--the first peasant house we saw.</span> <span id="s202">Fortunately, this was a house owned by an old Serb woman.</span> <span id="s203">And the Serbs were, at that time, again persecuted by the Croatians, just like the Jews.</span> <span id="s204">So she understood our plight.</span> <span id="s205">But she was afraid of harboring us.</span> <span id="s206">She said she could keep us only for so many hours.</span> <span id="s207">We sat there.</span> <span id="s208">We...we stayed in the house not knowing what to do.</span> <span id="s209">We couldn't go back to Zagreb.</span> <span id="s210">We couldn't go forward.</span> <span id="s211">We had false documents.</span> <span id="s212">We were lost.</span> <span id="s213">To all intents and purposes, it seemed a completely impossible situation.</span> <span id="s214">But again, we were lucky in that there was an Italian garrison in that town--as there were Italian garrisons all over the region which was not far from the sea, from the coast.</span> <span id="s215">At...we just ...we saw three Italian soldiers, or maybe four.</span> <span id="s216">I spoke a little Italian, almost nothing; and my father a little, because he took Italian in his high school days.</span> <span id="s217">We just approached these soldiers, just on the wild chance that they might help us.</span> <span id="s218">And we told them two words: "ebrei"--which means Jews, [and] "paura"--fear.</span> <span id="s219">They immediately understood, because they knew what was going on--as we now know.</span> <span id="s220">And they told us to quickly go back to the house, "calma"--calm, and they would bring their sergeant.</span> <span id="s221">Their sergeant came.</span> <span id="s222">He spoke some French, and uh, we...we knew French.</span> <span id="s223">It was easier to communicate.</span> <span id="s224">He said, "Stay here.</span> <span id="s225">I'll see if I can get maybe a pass for you, to get you into Italy."</span> <span id="s226">And he left.</span> <span id="s227">We didn't believe him.</span> <span id="s228">We thought he just said nice things.</span> <span id="s229">How would he, who is he, didn't want any money.</span> <span id="s230">He never knew us, but he came back.</span> <span id="s231">He said he couldn't get a pass for us; but at midnight he will come with a few soldiers and he will put us on an Italian military train.</span> <span id="s232">And there...and doing that would be enough to smuggle us into Italy proper.</span> <span id="s233">Again, we were quite skeptical.</span> <span id="s234">Why would he do that?</span> <span id="s235">But he did.</span> <span id="s236">And this was unforgettable.</span> <span id="s237">Uh, at night Italian soldiers carrying our bags and rucksacks, marching us--protectively--to the railroad station with this sergeant, waiting for an Italian military train.</span> <span id="s238">When the train came, he told us to get in; and he himself boarded the train.</span> <span id="s239">Now, the train was full of Italian soldiers who immediately gave room to the...to my mother and other ladies in the small group, offered us some food.</span> <span id="s240">And I think he just said, "These are refugees."</span> <span id="s241">And as soon as you heard the word...he said the word "refugee" to Italians, they immediately...their hearts melted.</span> <span id="s242">Whether it was an Italian refugee or a Jewish refugee, didn't matter.</span> <span id="s243">They didn't protest.</span> <span id="s244">After all, we were civilians.</span> <span id="s245">We had no right to be on that train at all.</span> <span id="s246">Then, at the border, there were difficulties.</span> <span id="s247">Now, I'm talking about the border with Italy proper; because that whole scheme of getting to Split, in Dalmatia, had to be abandoned.</span> <span id="s248">He wanted us to go to the city of Fiume [Croatian: Rijeka], from where we could go Trieste--which was then Italy--and we would be safe.</span> <span id="s249">He got us across the border.</span> <span id="s250">They didn't know what to do with us, so they put us into the Customs House.</span> <span id="s251">He went to the authorities and said, "Here are these refugees; they haven't had anything to eat or drink.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">They've got to be given something."</span> <span id="s253">And some women's organization came, and they gave us orangeade and sandwiches to eat.</span> <span id="s254">And we stayed there almost a whole day.</span> <span id="s255">He left us, because he was assured by the authorities that we could stay.</span> <span id="s256">He shook hands with us and left.</span> <span id="s257">We never knew his name.</span> <span id="s258">However, at night, we were surprised.</span> <span id="s259">The authorities really did not allow us to stay.</span> <span id="s260">They put us back on a train and pushed us back into Croatia.</span> <span id="s261">We pleaded with the, uh, Italian military police, the Carabinieri, to give us back our documents, such as they were, so the Ustaša would not see that we are being pushed back as Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Maybe that way we could escape, go back and try again.</span> <span id="s263">And the Carabinieri complied with our requests.</span> <span id="s264">So we made it back again, and we went all the way to Zagreb.</span> <span id="s265">We were totally exhausted.</span> <span id="s266">It was the most foolish thing to do, but we didn't really know what to do.</span> <span id="s267">And when we came to our apartment--this was only a few days later--it had already been taken.</span> <span id="s268">In the meantime, they came to search for us, to arrest all of us.</span> <span id="s269">Not having found us, they gave the apartment to a functionary of the Ustaša, who lived there.</span> <span id="s270">And the neighbors told us to just run away, because they were looking for us, as they were for other Jews.</span> <span id="s271">So we went again, and tried the same thing again.</span> <span id="s272">This time we made it across the border.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: How did you get across the border?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: We got off the train just before the border.</span> <span id="s275">We went to a village--again at random--and knocked on a door.</span> <span id="s276">And a peasant woman opened up.</span> <span id="s277">We actually told her who we were, that we were looking...we had money, we were looking for someone to smuggle us across the border.</span> <span id="s278">We knew that near the border, there were always smugglers.</span> <span id="s279">That is, there was always traffic from Italy into Yugoslavia and back; and that possibly the peasants would know some secret path.</span> <span id="s280">And it was true.</span> <span id="s281">Uh, this, uh, woman knew some people who took us across the border.</span> <span id="s282">We were not alone.</span> <span id="s283">We were also again in a group maybe of ten, twelve people.</span> <span id="s284">Not just the three of us.</span> <span id="s285">This time we made it.</span> <span id="s286">And we lived in a town near Fiume, in Italy, for one month.</span> <span id="s287">Hiding.</span> <span id="s288">But the Italian police found us after one month.</span> <span id="s289">They arrested my father and myself, kept us in for one night.</span> <span id="s290">The Police Commissioner was very embarrassed.</span> <span id="s291">And that was after the sergeant, the experience with the sergeant, which told us something about the Italians.</span> <span id="s292">Now the Commissioner of Police, when my father and I were brought to his office, he got up and he shook hands with us and asked us to sit down.</span> <span id="s293">This was not the Commissioner of Police that we expected to see.</span> <span id="s294">And he told us that he has no power to do anything, but he will leave our cell door open-- unlocked--as a symbol that we are not really prisoners.</span> <span id="s295">In the morning, we will be reunited with our wives and mothers.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">There were other Jews in that same town.</span> <span id="s297">They were all picked up.</span> <span id="s298">And so there was a sizable group of us.</span> <span id="s299">We were being marched to a bus.</span> <span id="s300">And we thought, "My God.</span> <span id="s301">Again they're going to push us back into Croatia."</span> <span id="s302">But they didn't do it.</span> <span id="s303">By that time--and we know this now--their policy has changed ...had changed.</span> <span id="s304">The policy of returning Jews or not letting them stay lasted only in the very first weeks of the Ustaša regime.</span> <span id="s305">Once the Italians grasped...understood what was going on with the Jews and the Serbs, and the Gypsies, they did not push anybody anymore across the border.</span> <span id="s306">They engaged in intense activity as to what's to be done.</span> <span id="s307">But we have documents today that clearly show that neither the Governor of Dalmatia nor the Italian General [Vittorio] Ambrosio in charge of the Second Army on that territory had any intentions to return us into the Ustaša hands.</span> <span id="s308">So the bus took us to former resort town of Cirquenizza--C-I-R-Q-U-E-N-I-Z-Z-A [Croatian: Crikvenica]-- where, uh, we used to go for summer vacation, as many others.</span> <span id="s309">It was the headquarters of the Fifth Corps.</span> <span id="s310">By that time there were some fifty or sixty, a small group of refugees.</span> <span id="s311">We 1 In an article published in Midstream in June/July 1983, Mr. Herzer identified this town as Sušak, a suburb of Fiume.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">settled there and we had, of course, representatives.</span> <span id="s313">My father was one of the oldest among the refugees.</span> <span id="s314">He spoke some Italian, so naturally he represented us.</span> <span id="s315">He went to the Major in charge of civilian affairs.</span> <span id="s316">He received him as if he were a friend.</span> <span id="s317">He said, "You are protected, and you are under Italian protection.</span> <span id="s318">Give us your names, your addresses.</span> <span id="s319">The Ustaša, who have the civil authority, won't be able to do you any physical harm."</span> <span id="s320">As an example, the Ustaša did not want to give us ration cards.</span> <span id="s321">The Italians forced them to give us ration cards.</span> <span id="s322">The Ustaša said we have to wear those signs--again, yellow signs.</span> <span id="s323">The Italians told us, "Well, let them have that.</span> <span id="s324">We must give in on some point.</span> <span id="s325">But physically, they will not be able to harm you, deport you, or put you in jail."</span> <span id="s326">Now, our numbers increased; because my experience roughly speaking was repeated in many cases.</span> <span id="s327">Between four and five thousand Croatian Jews--almost all that survived--found their way to the Italian occupation zone in Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s328">Either to the zone--we were in a zone, not yet in Italy--or to the annexed part of Yugoslavia, which was much safer.</span> <span id="s329">There were no Croatians there at all.</span> <span id="s330">But we were safe.</span> <span id="s331">All came and started a very extraordinary period in my life, because we developed close relations with the Italian army.</span> <span id="s332">Italian officers started dating Jewish girls.</span> <span id="s333">Uh, the Italian major came to play bridge with my parents and another Jewish lady.</span> <span id="s334">He brought me dictionaries.</span> <span id="s335">They brought us food.</span> <span id="s336">Uh, there were two things that stand out.</span> <span id="s337">One, that two weeks roughly I think after our arrival in Crikvenica was Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s338">And, uh, somehow the Italian major--whose name was Cipolla--learned this high holiday was at hand.</span> <span id="s339">He called my father, and told him that he had reserved a school room for the services.</span> <span id="s340">He abolished the curfew; because this was a war zone, due to guerrilla activity.</span> <span id="s341">He abolished the, uh, the ban on assembly which they had.</span> <span id="s342">You had to special permission if you had... As you normally have to have, in areas of martial law.</span> <span id="s343">And so we actually could celebrate Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s344">And he sent a lieutenant as his representative, who gave a little speech.</span> <span id="s345">It was incredible.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: How many people were there?</span> <span id="s347">And describe the scene.</span> <span id="s348">We're talking about Yom Kippur, Kol Nidre in a school house?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s350">This... (PAUSE) I don't think there were more than thirty, forty people there at the time.</span> <span id="s351">The numbers increased, but this was very early.</span> <span id="s352">This was somewhere in October '41.</span> <span id="s353">It was still early.</span> <span id="s354">October '41.</span> <span id="s355">It wasn't an elaborate service, but... And I don't even know and remember who held the services, who actually led; but there is always somebody you can find, among thirty Jews, somebody who would be able to do it.</span> <span id="s356">We could read, after all, Hebrew.</span> <span id="s357">We... somebody had, uh, the prayer books.</span> <span id="s358">And this was, of course, morally and psychologically, a tremendous boost.</span> <span id="s359">And shortly thereafter, we had another proof that they went--the Italians--beyond accepting us, or receiving us, or protecting us; when they invited all of us to a performance given for the Italian troops by an Italian military group of entertainers.</span> <span id="s360">And they gave us the place of honor, the first row.</span> <span id="s361">And, uh, it was really, I must say, uh, a..</span> <span id="s362">.</span> <span id="s363">a moment that I can't forget.</span> <span id="s364">When, uh, we stood up.</span> <span id="s365">The Italian national anthem was played.</span> <span id="s366">The anthem of an Axis power, of the closest ally of Germany.</span> <span id="s367">And here are twenty, thirty Jews as their guests of honor.</span> <span id="s368">We couldn't understand it.</span> <span id="s369">It was just like a dream.</span> <span id="s370">This situation existed until November '42.</span> <span id="s371">Almost a year.</span> <span id="s372">We studied Italian.</span> <span id="s373">We felt safe.</span> <span id="s374">We, of course, wrote furiously to those who survived the initial deportations to come to the zone in...in whatever way possible.</span> <span id="s375">The connections established with the Italian officers-- that is, the connections we establish with them--were very productive.</span> <span id="s376">Because these officers were able to go, of course, anywhere in Croatia.</span> <span id="s377">Wherever they wanted to.</span> <span id="s378">And they would go by trucks and cars; and bring the parents, bring the sisters and bring the relatives of the Jews who were already in their zone.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: And they did that?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: And they did that.</span> <span id="s381">They even used armored cars, in a fake exercise, military exercise; and they did it at first on their own and spontaneously, without informing too much their very high authorities.</span> <span id="s382">So that the evidence is episodic, it's in anecdotes.</span> <span id="s383">But it is known that so many, that today there is no question that this was... It started from the lower ranks of the Army, just as our sergeant and many other such sergeants or lieutenants.</span> <span id="s384">But then it became a policy.</span> <span id="s385">It... it received complete approval by the highest levels of the Army and the Italian Foreign Ministry; which we, of course, did not know then.</span> <span id="s386">But we know today.</span> <span id="s387">Now, we could guess that the pressure on Italians that the Germans and Croatians exercised for our extradition was enormous.</span> <span id="s388">What right do they have to protect Jews who are not Italian citizens?</span> <span id="s389">Because we really had nothing whatsoever in common with Italy.</span> <span id="s390">And they fought back diplomatically until November '42, when they felt they have to do something-- otherwise, they would have to yield to the Germans or the Croatians.</span> <span id="s391">They decided to put all the Jews in the Yugoslav zones under the occupation into a camp.</span> <span id="s392">Plus several hotels, those regions that were very far from the camp.</span> <span id="s393">Tell the Germans we are in a camp.</span> <span id="s394">Tell the Germans that a census is being taken to see if any... any one of us might have some claims to Italian citizenship, because Italian citizens were protected.</span> <span id="s395">Jewish are not, all the time, at the time.</span> <span id="s396">There were even some Italian Jews living in Germany, and the Germans would not touch them.</span> <span id="s397">So the Italians used that as a pretext.</span> <span id="s398">This was part of a plan, of a consciously designed plan by a so-called rescue committee headed by the highest officials of the Italian Foreign Ministry--Pietromarchi,D'Ajeta,Ducci, several other names, all known today, in the Foreign Ministry--decided that the Jews would not be turned over to the Germans anywhere the Italians had control of the territory.</span> <span id="s399">The Italian Army cooperated with this whole-heartedly.</span> <span id="s400">In November '42, the Italians arrested all of us, put us on trucks, and we were taken to this camp--still Croatian Yugoslav territory, but under Italian flag.</span> <span id="s401">We didn't know again; we thought maybe this is just a stage before our being turned over to the Croatians.</span> <span id="s402">And, unfortunately, there were two people committed suicide; and the morale was very low.</span> <span id="s403">And the Italian commander of...of the Second Army, which is a very high official, he came personally to the camp to give us a speech to reassure us that we would be 2 Count Luca Pietromarchi was head of the Occupied Territories Department of the Italian Foreign Ministry.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">3 Count Blasco Lanzo d'Ajeta was Bureau Chief under Foreign Minister Ciano.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">4 Including Vittorio Castellani, who served as liaison officer between the Second Army and the Foreign Ministry.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">protected.</span> <span id="s407">"As long as that flag flies there, nobody can touch the camp."</span> <span id="s408">And we were told that we were free within the camp to organize ourselves; which we did.</span> <span id="s409">They gave us the possibility of having a school--elementary and high school--synagogue, social hall.</span> <span id="s410">Medical facilities were in...in the camp were primitive, but all serious cases--and there were many-- were taken outside the camp into the Italian military hospital.</span> <span id="s411">So that, while the camp itself was an ex-Yugoslav, uh, military base for the cavalry--so that we really lived in stables--but it...conditions were harsh but quite tolerable.</span> <span id="s412">There was no physical threat.</span> <span id="s413">There was no outright hunger; even though the rations were quite small.</span> <span id="s414">But we had opportunity to buy food, extra food.</span> <span id="s415">There were people with means who were allowed to contribute, and then someone would go to Italy and bring food.</span> <span id="s416">The Italian Jewish organizations helped us, because they were allowed to function under Mussolini.</span> <span id="s417">So that while we didn't have the ideal nutrition, nobody really starved.</span> <span id="s418">After all, we did go to school.</span> <span id="s419">I studied English; besides, many other people studied the chess.</span> <span id="s420">Our evenings were free, and it wasn't the worst way to spend your days in World War II.</span> <span id="s421">Without there, you had the storm of the Final Solution not so many miles away from us.</span> <span id="s422">To think today that there were one million children perished; and here, under the Italian flag, we studied Latin and history and the Italian language and philosophy....</span> <span id="s423">It's still incredible that it happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: How did your family manage in this, under these sparse conditions?</span> <span id="s425">What did your parents do?</span> <span id="s426">What did you do?</span> <span id="s427">Did your father work, for instance?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: No.</span> <span id="s429">My father owned a third of the house where we lived.</span> <span id="s430">Two sisters and my father, and we sold the house about two weeks before the Germans attacked.</span> <span id="s431">And so we had some capital.</span> <span id="s432">My father was near 60, at the time; my mother, much younger.</span> <span id="s433">So there was no work.</span> <span id="s434">There was only... In Cirquenizza, before we were in the camp, we lived from...from the money that we got for the house.</span> <span id="s435">And in the camp, we had some extra money; but there was no work.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Everybody had to do something only to maintain the camp.</span> <span id="s437">The main thing is that my...my recollection is that there was no fear, because we didn't see any maltreatment, any mistreatment of anyone, any torture, any beating.</span> <span id="s438">I..</span> <span id="s439">.</span> <span id="s440">because I went to school, I was detailed to the ...to clean, to the cleaning of the grounds--as were other students.</span> <span id="s441">But Italian soldiers also had to work doing the same tasks.</span> <span id="s442">So I had a broom; and the Italian soldier had a broom.</span> <span id="s443">We worked together.</span> <span id="s444">It was this kind of thing that it's hard to imagine.</span> <span id="s445">It was a concentration camp, in that it was surrounded by barbed wire; but one where we did not want to leave.</span> <span id="s446">In the country, there were people still--late arrivals--who petitioned the Italian authorities to send them to the camp, because it was the only safe place to be--for Jews.</span> <span id="s447">(PAUSE) I was also growing up, in a sense, in those years; because I was sixteen when the whole thing started in 19--at the end.</span> <span id="s448">I tried to continue living sort of as a goody-goody student; because it was tough to study Latin and so on under those circumstances.</span> <span id="s449">But as I say, the feeling of security was such that it compensated for all the hardship.</span> <span id="s450">For example, we celebrated Passover 1943.</span> <span id="s451">I found a document where the Italian command approved celebration of Passover in the camp.</span> <span id="s452">But we had the camp commandant and the other officers as our guests; and they sat in the first row of the social hall, where there were chairs.</span> <span id="s453">We had musical entertainment.</span> <span id="s454">There were many people in the camp, of course, who could play musical instruments.</span> <span id="s455">There were some singers.</span> <span id="s456">The Italians were starved for this; because they were generally...the officers were quite well educated.</span> <span id="s457">And here they had an opportunity to listen to Italian opera and Italian songs.</span> <span id="s458">And so, it wasn't really a relationship of captors to captured.</span> <span id="s459">It was quite close.</span> <span id="s460">Again, it would not have been a bad thing for us or anybody to...to...to live the war--as terrible as it was--in that way.</span> <span id="s461">Unfortunately, there were always other events pressing that rendered our situation precarious.</span> <span id="s462">1943--just to give a quick overview, in January '43 was Stalingrad.</span> <span id="s463">Great reverse for the Germans.</span> <span id="s464">Not much later the loss of Africa, North Africa.</span> <span id="s465">The Italians realized that the Allies would invade Italy.</span> <span id="s466">The Italian army might be pulled back.</span> <span id="s467">And they started to worry what would they do with us.</span> <span id="s468">They decided to then concentrate all the Jews, not just in the camp where we were--which was one of about two thousand people--but there were also other smaller camps.</span> <span id="s469">Not really camps: there were Jewish groups in hotels around the Dubrovnik in the south.</span> <span id="s470">To concentrate all the Jews in one camp on the island of Arbe [Croatian: Rab].</span> <span id="s471">This island was Yugoslav island.</span> <span id="s472">It is still Yugoslavia today; but then it was annexed to Italy.</span> <span id="s473">To remove us from the Croatian authorities completely.</span> <span id="s474">They proceeded to do this in July 1943.</span> <span id="s475">And that camp--again the numbers, they still... No one knows how many there were, because the Italians always quote ...quoted lower numbers to the Germans than the turnovers are the Jews.</span> <span id="s476">Said no there were more of us; but I think it was something like three to four thousand in this one large camp in Arbe.</span> <span id="s477">July '43 was also the month when Mussolini fell; and September 8th, Italy surrendered to the Allies.</span> <span id="s478">And that was the moment of the great danger for us, because the Italians surrendered.</span> <span id="s479">The camp now was free.</span> <span id="s480">The Italian Army did not manage to arrange for our transfer to Italy proper.</span> <span id="s481">The soldiers just threw away their weapons and left.</span> <span id="s482">We were free; but the Germans and the Ustaša were not so far.</span> <span id="s483">And that was the moment of great danger for us.</span> <span id="s484">Fortunately, Tito's partisans took over that island for a while.</span> <span id="s485">And in that interim period, most of the...by far, of the camp inmates either went to the mountains, to the mainland; or, as we did, went south toward Anglo-American-occupied Italy.</span> <span id="s486">Some are trying to reach Italy in December on the Adriatic, which was pretty fool- hardy to...to try.</span> <span id="s487">But we did.</span> <span id="s488">Two hundred people could not make it.</span> <span id="s489">They were old and sick; and they were found by the Germans and taken to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s490">But, as I said, the great majority of us--almost three thousand-- survived, thanks to the Italian intervention and protection in the years '41 to '43.</span> <span id="s491">Which they practiced in the south of France, and in Greece, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">(Technical Conversation)</span></p> <p><span id="s493">TAPE #2</span></p> <p><span id="s494">(Technical Conversation)</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: Ivo, let's pick up, uh, with your story of moving south.</span> <span id="s496">Uh, the camp had been opened and you were free.</span> <span id="s497">Did you have any contact with Tito's Partisans yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: Uh, very, very little.</span> <span id="s499">Very little.</span> <span id="s500">(PAUSE)</span></p> <p><span id="s501">(Technical conversation)</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: The camp is opened.</span> <span id="s503">Some of you went north.</span> <span id="s504">Your family now is heading south.</span> <span id="s505">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s507">Tell us about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: We, we knew that the Allies had landed not only in Sicily, but also southern Italy.</span> <span id="s509">So that the line from Bari, the major city on the Adriatic coast, was already in Anglo-American hands.</span> <span id="s510">Now to get there, one had to go quite some distance--uh, island-hopping, so to say, because there are many islands, in the midst of uncertainty.</span> <span id="s511">Who is on the next island?</span> <span id="s512">How is the population?</span> <span id="s513">Are they pro-German, pro-Ustaša, or what?</span> <span id="s514">Everywhere we went, we saw white flags.</span> <span id="s515">The poor people on those islands who suffered hunger anyway, they wanted to say they surrendered to whoever comes.</span> <span id="s516">They're not going to fight.</span> <span id="s517">They were small islands, and I think that helped us.</span> <span id="s518">We didn't come as...we just came as a small group.</span> <span id="s519">And it's not clear to me how my parents and other, uh, grown-ups managed to arrange.</span> <span id="s520">I know it was money to pay someone to take us in a small boat to the next island.</span> <span id="s521">The conditions were bad.</span> <span id="s522">It was December, and the Adriatic was not, uh, a very calm sea at that time.</span> <span id="s523">But this was also good, because German patrols didn't go out very much.</span> <span id="s524">So we managed to reach a large island of Vis, V - I - S. On that island there were some British torpedo boats and Partisans; but at that time, the Partisans were Stalinists.</span> <span id="s525">Did not allow any contact with the British, so that we could not contact them.</span> <span id="s526">Fortunately, there were other refugees--not Jewish refugees, but just refugees.</span> <span id="s527">People from...running away from the horrible conditions of the multiple civil wars within Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s528">There were Quislings, the Partisans, the Chetniks and all the other groups fighting each other; and many people just couldn't stand it anymore.</span> <span id="s529">So that island was full of refugees.</span> <span id="s530">And all I can remember is that at one point all of us were picked up by a British ship military ship.</span> <span id="s531">Actually, it was a passenger ship which they requisitioned.</span> <span id="s532">And it brought us to Bari.</span> <span id="s533">But the British would not let us off the ship in Bari.</span> <span id="s534">They directed us to Taranto, all the way in the south of Italy.</span> <span id="s535">And from there, we were taken to camps again.</span> <span id="s536">The British had camps at the very heel of Italy.</span> <span id="s537">And so we landed again in camps.</span> <span id="s538">We were fed.</span> <span id="s539">We were safe.</span> <span id="s540">And the fate that the British ordained for us was to transfer us to Egypt, to some camps...tent camps outside Cairo.</span> <span id="s541">The problem is...was that we were then surrounded by refugees; and among those refugees were also former Ustaša and elements.</span> <span id="s542">Because the war was coming to a close; and those days people would then run simply and cross and defect from one side to the winning side.</span> <span id="s543">And we decided to get out of that camp in Italy now.</span> <span id="s544">And that was possible.</span> <span id="s545">We had to sign some papers; and then by train came to Bari, Italy--which was under the British Eighth Army.</span> <span id="s546">So that this was really then the liberation, in a sense, for me.</span> <span id="s547">We were then safe.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: What did you do in Bari?</span> <span id="s549">You were in Bari?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: In Bari, the British Army employed masses of refugees--and later also Italians, who were only considered co-belligerents--for all kinds of duties, from menial to duties of translators.</span> <span id="s551">I got a job within one week with the British Field Security as translator and typist; because I knew English by that time, having studied very hard in the Italian camp.</span> <span id="s552">I didn't know what it sounded like, but I still knew it.</span> <span id="s553">But by that time I knew Italian and Serb-Croatian and German; and there were always questions and documents and, uh, interrogations of...of prisoners.</span> <span id="s554">And it was chaotic, to say the least, also in that time.</span> <span id="s555">And they needed somebody to do it.</span> <span id="s556">So that was a job which then paid and gave us rations.</span> <span id="s557">It was very easy, in a way, it seemed, to make a living.</span> <span id="s558">My mother got a job.</span> <span id="s559">She worked for a British outfit called Toch- H (ph), which served tea and crumpets to the British officers and commissioned...non- commissioned officers, too.</span> <span id="s560">So she got a job there because she knew English from before.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">And finally, my father even found employment in censorship.</span> <span id="s562">Uh, they had a vast Censorship Office; uh, and he would read all these letters.</span> <span id="s563">And sometimes letters by people that he knew.</span> <span id="s564">And he would just say, "Hello, here are my greetings," and "Why are you writing so much?</span> <span id="s565">," or whatever.</span> <span id="s566">Those were very good times.</span> <span id="s567">Now we were in Italy.</span> <span id="s568">Uh, all I thought of was to resume my life somehow.</span> <span id="s569">But as I say, there was, of course, physical safety.</span> <span id="s570">And then the gratitude we felt toward the Italians, and the way the Italians even then received us.</span> <span id="s571">I, uh, studied for my high school, for Italian high school final exam--which is not very easy.</span> <span id="s572">So I studied at night with a professor while I worked.</span> <span id="s573">And, uh, again, they ...in the test, the test they gave me, the oral test, they chose questions that they knew I would answer with greater ease than some others.</span> <span id="s574">They didn't ask me obscure questions about Italian history, but something that they felt I could answer.</span> <span id="s575">So their attitude toward refugees are people in trouble carried through.</span> <span id="s576">Even though at that time, for example, there were great difficulties with Yugoslavia; because Yugoslavia wanted Trieste.</span> <span id="s577">And we were...Yugoslavs would have been enemies of Italy.</span> <span id="s578">And they never were very friendly, because the two countries have always had a great deal of difficulty because of Dalmatia--coveted by Italy, and so on.</span> <span id="s579">And yet, on a personal level, I never experienced that.</span> <span id="s580">I spoke very good Italian, which helped; because if you speak Italian, the Italians generally will feel this is quite an honor to them.</span> <span id="s581">Somebody took the trouble to study the language.</span> <span id="s582">So my difficulties were over.</span> <span id="s583">But I didn't yet quite realize how rare the Italian gesture was, because the full impact of the Holocaust was not known.</span> <span id="s584">I'm talking now about 1944, '45.</span> <span id="s585">It wasn't known.</span> <span id="s586">It came out differently and slowly; and gradually, one realized what...what really happened.</span> <span id="s587">And what could have happened to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: Bari.</span> <span id="s589">You stayed in Bari for how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: I stayed in Bari from January '44 'til 1946, somewhere '46.</span> <span id="s591">Q: Where did you live?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: Lived in the middle of a city, in an apartment.</span> <span id="s593">The apartment was assigned to us by the British military authorities that assigned empty apartments to refugees.</span> <span id="s594">Because many Italians had fled.</span> <span id="s595">Fled the bombing; or many Fascists fled, thinking that they would be punished if caught.</span> <span id="s596">So there were many apartments free.</span> <span id="s597">So we lived there in this assigned apartment.</span> <span id="s598">I'm sure the rent was almost zero.</span> <span id="s599">I worked, in the beginning; and this was enough to feed us, because I got rations plus money.</span> <span id="s600">And I then got another job.</span> <span id="s601">After the job with the Field Security, I got a job teaching English to Yugoslav partisans who were in hospitals all around Bari.</span> <span id="s602">So I worked for the British Council, which is like the Voice of America.</span> <span id="s603">It is a similar organization.</span> <span id="s604">Uh, and they paid quite well.</span> <span id="s605">So I..</span> <span id="s606">.</span> <span id="s607">we were able to really be independent.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: It sounds as if you lived really fairly comfortably.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: Yes, I..</span> <span id="s610">.</span> <span id="s611">I think we...we did.</span> <span id="s612">Because with two of us working, and then three of us working, surely.</span> <span id="s613">Then came the end of the war; and then the British Council closed its doors, and I went to Rome.</span> <span id="s614">Someone told me go the American Joint Distribution Committee.</span> <span id="s615">I went there, and it was early in the formation of the Joint.</span> <span id="s616">I'm using the word "Joint" - it's the American Joint Distribution.</span> <span id="s617">Was...and they said, "Yes, you can.</span> <span id="s618">You'll work for us.</span> <span id="s619">If you know these languages, fine."</span> <span id="s620">So I moved to Rome; and my parents then moved later, a little bit later.</span> <span id="s621">And I worked for the Joint Distribution Committee from '46 until '48.</span> <span id="s622">I was an administrative secretary in the HaSharot Department.</span> <span id="s623">We dealt with the refugees of the, of the Brichah, the...the Jewish survivors of the Holocaust who sought to go to Palestine--later Israel.</span> <span id="s624">They reached Italy from Poland or Russia, from all the other camps; but before that, they were housed in various places in Italy.</span> <span id="s625">And then they would generally secretly embark and hope not to be intercepted by the British and taken to Cyprus.</span> <span id="s626">Well, I worked in that department, in an administrative capacity to somebody; and did translations and dictations and so on, visiting those HaSharot, listening to...to what they needed, their needs, their requests, making out requisitions and so on.</span> <span id="s627">This was until 1948.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: Tell me... Talk about the Joint during this period.</span> <span id="s629">You were really in the middle of all this.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">What was the organization itself like during this period and what kinds of things did you do?</span> <span id="s631">Let's talk about the organization first.</span> <span id="s632">What it was like?</span> <span id="s633">How big was it?</span> <span id="s634">How active were the people who worked for it?</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: The upper management came from the United States; and, uh, the, uh, middle management and support staff was all recruited from refugees.</span> <span id="s636">Not so much locally, not...not the Italians; but refugees, uh, who came from various countries of Europe.</span> <span id="s637">The Yugoslavs were very numerous, because obviously there were many Yugoslavs who found themselves in Italy.</span> <span id="s638">But there were Poles, and Germans and Austrians, and so on.</span> <span id="s639">There was a very mixed staff.</span> <span id="s640">The activities that had to deal with the actual illegal immigration were not known to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">They...I mean, they...they kept it well hidden.</span> <span id="s642">I mean, I did not overtly have you know anything.</span> <span id="s643">I..</span> <span id="s644">.</span> <span id="s645">I only surmised that something was going on; when suddenly, two HaSharot were closed and nobody was there.</span> <span id="s646">But it had to be done this way, because the British of course didn't just want to intercept the immigrants or potential immigrants at sea.</span> <span id="s647">But they pressured the Italian government to use their police surveillance to prevent the embarkation of Jews bent on...on breaking the blockade to Palestine.</span> <span id="s648">So it had to be really kept very secret.</span> <span id="s649">And I know it was because none...none of the co-workers that I remember knew anything about it.</span> <span id="s650">There were a few individuals, I remember, who were Sabras; and they were, I think, in charge of that.</span> <span id="s651">And they did not have a clear job.</span> <span id="s652">It was never clear to me what they were doing; but they spoke perfect Hebrew, and they looked to me like the kind of guys who could and would organize and had no fear.</span> <span id="s653">Very decisive men, who could not only lead a meeting but also lead people at night through a mine field.</span> <span id="s654">That much I..</span> <span id="s655">.</span> <span id="s656">I still remember; but I didn't have direct, any direct work.</span> <span id="s657">I didn't take part in that.</span> <span id="s658">(PAUSE) The question was for everyone, when the war ended, what do to, where to go.</span> <span id="s659">We didn't want to go back to Yugoslavia--which was at that time not just Communist, but Stalinist Communist.</span> <span id="s660">And we just couldn't.</span> <span id="s661">Certainly my father would not go, and I would do whatever he said.</span> <span id="s662">At that time, I wasn't on my own; and I never had any desire to go there.</span> <span id="s663">The question was Palestine or Israel on one hand, or the New World.</span> <span id="s664">But out of Europe.</span> <span id="s665">Many people wanted out, just out.</span> <span id="s666">And, uh, I received a Hillel B'nai B'rith scholarship in '48, which then decided.</span> <span id="s667">And the decision was made then for me, obviously, that I could go and study, make up the lost time.</span> <span id="s668">Because somehow, in the narrow vision, that's all I saw--that I lost these years, and I had to make them up.</span> <span id="s669">That was the main thing.</span> <span id="s670">Especially after the shock--which was a big shock to me--that now that I survived, I really couldn't go back.</span> <span id="s671">Because I always wanted to go back.</span> <span id="s672">I mean, in my dreams or in my feelings and hopes, that if I survive, the war is over, we're only a few miles from Zagreb, we will go back.</span> <span id="s673">And I'll find some friends; and, uh, somehow you go back.</span> <span id="s674">I never thought of really leaving while I was under the Italian control.</span> <span id="s675">But then afterwards, it became clear that there was no back, that there were no friends.</span> <span id="s676">Because Croatia, that independent state of Croatia we talked about, the Ustaša Croatia, contained about thirty thousand Jews.</span> <span id="s677">But no more than, uh, fifteen percent survived.</span> <span id="s678">So really, even apart from the regime, there was no real going back.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: It must have been very hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: This was very hard.</span> <span id="s681">It was very, uh...in a way it was, to realize that you're in exile, in a sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Because it is, after all, we couldn't go back.</span> <span id="s683">We could have.</span> <span id="s684">But in 1948, when Tito broke with Soviets and allowed the Jews to leave, practically all Yugoslav Jews left for Israel.</span> <span id="s685">Not all, but practically all.</span> <span id="s686">They just weren't happy there.</span> <span id="s687">But not because of any antisemitism, but just the conditions.</span> <span id="s688">After all, the conditions were just the way they are today in Poland or East Germany and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: So you had this B'nai B'rith scholarship?</span> <span id="s690">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q: To where?</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: To the University of Illinois.</span> <span id="s693">I said I wanted to study engineering.</span> <span id="s694">And, uh, then they gave scholarship to quite a few individuals who had to prove that they knew English, and so on and so on, and finished high school.</span> <span id="s695">Which wasn't easy in Europe to achieve.</span> <span id="s696">But they choose...they chose the school; and they sent me to the University of Illinois in 1948.</span> <span id="s697">And I, uh, studied electrical engineering, and I graduated in 1951 because I had some courses.</span> <span id="s698">I..</span> <span id="s699">.</span> <span id="s700">I went to University in Bari and took some engineering courses also.</span> <span id="s701">So they recognized that.</span> <span id="s702">And I went summers, and speeded up.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: Did your parents come with you, and how?</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: No.</span> <span id="s705">That was probably the worst thing, uh, in our lives.</span> <span id="s706">That we were together during the war, and could not really be together afterwards.</span> <span id="s707">Because they were...applied for, on a quota, for a visa to get to the United States; and, uh, there was a spot on my father's lungs.</span> <span id="s708">And an American doctor said this is TB.</span> <span id="s709">And from that moment on--no matter what other doctors said or what other tests were conducted showing that it's a dead process, not an active process, because my father was a heavy smoker--that original decision could not be rescinded.</span> <span id="s710">But my mother was forced to come here so she would not loose her place.</span> <span id="s711">She came in 1949 to the United States.</span> <span id="s712">Had to leave him there.</span> <span id="s713">In 1949, he was already 66 years old; and he could never get this entry visa, even though later on he came as a visitor.</span> <span id="s714">My mother went there from back to Italy.</span> <span id="s715">By that time, they had no more money.</span> <span id="s716">They had no more way; you know, it was difficult.</span> <span id="s717">I was going to school here, and so they were getting some help from, uh, United Nations refugee organization, UNRRA.</span> <span id="s718">But we had relatives in Israel, and they told them to come.</span> <span id="s719">So they went to Israel in 1954.</span> <span id="s720">And I became a citizen here in 1955, and so I was able to then leave and go and visit them.</span> <span id="s721">But, uh, those were great efforts.</span> <span id="s722">And I tried to... You know, the x-ray pictures were sent to me; and I showed them to doctors here, and they were all unanimous and said, "No, this is obviously not an open process.</span> <span id="s723">And even if it were, so what?</span> <span id="s724">I mean, the man can be put into a hospital in under observation."</span> <span id="s725">But they wouldn't let him in.</span> <span id="s726">This was part of a..</span> <span id="s727">.</span> <span id="s728">at that time, of an effort to let as few Jews in as possible; which according to ...which is...which was true according to, uh, research that was done much later.</span> <span id="s729">I myself came under the displaced persons law, because I came as a student.</span> <span id="s730">Even that was not easy, because for me to come to the United States I had to have a student visa.</span> <span id="s731">I couldn't get an immigrant's visa, because I..</span> <span id="s732">.</span> <span id="s733">my...my number wasn't up.</span> <span id="s734">To get a student's visa, you have to have a national passport.</span> <span id="s735">So that if you commit a crime, the United States can send you back.</span> <span id="s736">But I had no national passport.</span> <span id="s737">I had to renounce my Yugoslav citizenship.</span> <span id="s738">I was stateless.</span> <span id="s739">How can you then get a student visa?</span> <span id="s740">So again, the Italians said, "Well, we'll give you a statement that we will let you into Italy if the Americans push you out."</span> <span id="s741">And that should convince the Consul that he could give me the visa; which they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: So you came here.</span> <span id="s743">You went to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A: I went to school in Illinois; and stayed one more year to get a Master's.</span> <span id="s745">I almost got it, but I didn't quite get it.</span> <span id="s746">And then I went to New York from, uh, Illinois and started working.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: As an engineer?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: As an engineer.</span> <span id="s749">And then got other degrees at night; which was for many years I got the Master's, and so on.</span> <span id="s750">And then slowly thinking and rethinking all those events, I became more and more interested in--not only my past, but in this aspect of the...the rescue.</span> <span id="s751">The...the Italian story.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: Thank you.</span> <span id="s753">It's quite a story.</span> <span id="s754">Ivo, I'd like to back up a minute.</span> <span id="s755">The island-hopping you did in order to get to Bari, from the camp to Bari.</span> <span id="s756">Can you describe it in a little more detail?</span> <span id="s757">Uh, we don't uh... Did people take out sailboats?</span> <span id="s758">Did you do this at night?</span> <span id="s759">How was this done?</span></p> <p><span id="s760">A: This was mostly...mostly small motor boats and sail boats.</span> <span id="s761">Mostly.</span> <span id="s762">It's all I remember.</span> <span id="s763">There were maybe five or six islands, when I was island-hopping, before the big one.</span> <span id="s764">I remember, on one island we were so...we were tired.</span> <span id="s765">We somehow found our way to...to the local teachers--a married couple.</span> <span id="s766">They gave us their bedroom to use for that night.</span> <span id="s767">I don't know how, because I was not involved.</span> <span id="s768">It was all, again, in the hands of, you know, my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">There was always a leader in a group; because we were a part of a small group of people.</span> <span id="s770">And then there was another group and they came to the same island, and so you have a group, so to say, travelling.</span> <span id="s771">And the last big hop to the big island, where the British were, there we had a big boat--70-ton fishing boat.</span> <span id="s772">And, uh, the sea was very bad, and there were too many of us.</span> <span id="s773">It was awful.</span> <span id="s774">What they did is, they left the older people in the hold; and us, the younger ones, they lashed us with ropes on the...uh on the deck, so we wouldn't be washed away by the waves.</span> <span id="s775">And the sea was mined; but the mines were much deeper than this small boat, relatively small boat.</span> <span id="s776">Seventy tons is not very big.</span> <span id="s777">So we were also safe that way.</span> <span id="s778">And I actually, again, profited by that; because being out in fresh air, even though there were waves and it was scary, but I didn't get so sick as the people down in the hold.</span> <span id="s779">But I don't have any clear specific, you know, incident to relate.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Q: And you have no sense of how this was organized, or how it was done?</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: It was done... No, it was done on a day-by-day.</span> <span id="s782">There was no...that we would line somewhere.</span> <span id="s783">So the man who, the local fisherman or someone, who brought us there would be paid; and we...we tried to sleep somewhere on the ground, or some house or school.</span> <span id="s784">And then, maybe, find somebody else.</span> <span id="s785">Again, we have some money or clothes.</span> <span id="s786">I remember, we gave some clothes.</span> <span id="s787">In fact, my Bar Mitzvah blue suit was given away, I think, on one of these islands--as a contribution which was more important than money; because money really didn't mean much at that rate.</span> <span id="s788">People, again, wanted clothes, gold, food and so on.</span> <span id="s789">But I don't have any specifics; recollections of an interesting incident.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Q: When the British interned you, as it were, uh, again... How... You never, in fact, got taken to Egypt.</span> <span id="s791">You were...you were... what was that like?</span> <span id="s792">You were under the British control.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">A: We were in a camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q: What was that camp like?</span> <span id="s795">The British camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">A: We were housed in hotels and abandoned villas.</span> <span id="s797">We slept on the floor, stone floor.</span> <span id="s798">Uh, it was typical refugee, refugee-type situation.</span> <span id="s799">You know, if you can imagine the Red Cross... When people are evacuated--the disaster, you know, make-shift quarters.</span> <span id="s800">But we were fed.</span> <span id="s801">Uh, and I don't know how many people there were; but I think this was a pretty large camp.</span> <span id="s802">It wasn't only Jews.</span> <span id="s803">In fact, mostly non-Jewish refugees from Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s804">Uh, we heard--but we were not told, we heard-- this is in rumors, that the camp was destined for El Saff.</span> <span id="s805">That was the place somewhere outside Cairo.</span> <span id="s806">And I remember my father said, "No.</span> <span id="s807">Not one more camp.</span> <span id="s808">If we can get out of here, let's get out of here.</span> <span id="s809">Somehow we will be able to live in Italy."</span> <span id="s810">Because uh again, this wasn't something that we knew, but we felt it's...it's possible.</span> <span id="s811">It will be possible to make a..</span> <span id="s812">.</span> <span id="s813">to exist, rather than in the camp.</span> <span id="s814">Only proved to be true.</span> <span id="s815">But we had no contact with the outside world.</span> <span id="s816">Although there was... I'm sure that many things were going on; and Jewish organizations might have been active, the Italian-Jewish.</span> <span id="s817">I didn't know, I did not know that.</span> <span id="s818">I was still a little dizzy.</span> <span id="s819">I was...</span></p> <p><span id="s820">END OF VIDEOTAPE ... Well, the main thought is that I'm glad now that, uh, that the Italian contribution to the rescue is now becoming known.</span> <span id="s821">Even though it involved few people, compared to the tremendous tragedy of the Jewish nation.</span> <span id="s822">Still, there were so few positive episodes in the Holocaust that this one had to be recorded, made known.</span> <span id="s823">And I'm glad now that I see that books are coming out and articles, research is being done; that this is finally, after 40 years, becoming known.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s825">Ivo, thank you very much.</span> <span id="s826">A: You're welcome.</span></p></body></html>
