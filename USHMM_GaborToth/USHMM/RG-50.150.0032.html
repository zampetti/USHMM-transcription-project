id="s4">FW: Can you tell me a little about your education?</span></p> <p><span id="s5">GR: For the first year or the first two years, I cannot remember whether it was one or two years, I went to a private school, but due to Hitler the school was disbanded then I had to go to a volksschule.</span> <span id="s6">For two years, I mean after four years then gymnasium.</span></p> <p><span id="s7">FW: When you say school was disbanded due to Hitler, how early was t his?</span></p> <p><span id="s8">GR: You are asking me a question for which I’m not prepared.</span> <span id="s9">What year did I start school?</span> <span id="s10">I was born in ‘22, I guess I was six years old.</span> <span id="s11">It can’t be.</span> <span id="s12">How old were we when we went to school in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">FW: About six or seven.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">GR: That doesn’t make sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">FW: Well in any case you went to this private school, was it a Jewish school.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">GR: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">FW: Okay.</span> <span id="s18">And then you went to the volksschule?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">GR: Yes for two years, but I went to the lycium in 1933, so it must have been at least 1929.</span> <span id="s20">I never really thought of it, but I know it was due to that fact.</span> <span id="s21">I had always been told.</span> <span id="s22">if it interests you I can try to find out if that was the reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">FW: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">GR: Because I have friends that went there too and I can check that out.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">FW: Okay.</span> <span id="s26">That would be fine, but in any case you went to the volksschule there and then you went to the lycium.</span> <span id="s27">Did you intend to go on with your education?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">GR: I went after lycium, by the way I graduated after five years of lycium, not six years.</span> <span id="s29">At that time Hitler changed the law.</span> <span id="s30">I then went on to the [ ] Institute for [ ] in Darmstadt.</span> <span id="s31">I was going to become a laboratory technician for either a brewery or a mill.</span> <span id="s32">It was a very highly specialized field, but I was always in Physics or Chemistry.</span> <span id="s33">I would probably have switched to the Gymnasium at some point and gone on to become a chemist or something like that, but due to hitler I never did.</span> <span id="s34">To even make an attempt at that point...We were looking for something for me to do where we thought I could get a job here.</span> <span id="s35">After I immigrated.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">FW: While you were growing up in Nuremberg, and while you were in school, did you have many non-Jewish as well as Jewish friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">GR: We couldn’t.</span> <span id="s38">I mean after Hitler there was a total separation.</span> <span id="s39">I mean I did go in the streetcar with a non-Jewish girl, but after awhile as much as she hated, and she was very frank to me, she said look, I dare not to be seen with you.</span> <span id="s40">I can’t afford it.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">FW: This was while you were in the lycium?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">GR: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">FW: In the lycium were there non-Jewish children?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">GR: We were a minority.</span> <span id="s45">Very minority.</span> <span id="s46">At first I believe there were more in the classes, and then came this law, but I have no idea what year or what.</span> <span id="s47">But unless the father were a veteran of the war, World War I, every Jew was thrown out of the l lycium.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">FW: And your father was a veteran?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">GR: My father had been a veteran, an army officer so I had no problems as far as that was concerned.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">FW: How did you feel after your friends had to leave the school whose fathers were not?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">GR: You see I have no recollection whether any of my immediate friends in my class were involved.</span> <span id="s52">I had friends in other schools.</span> <span id="s53">Nuremberg had more than one lycium.</span> <span id="s54">And a very close friend of mine was definitely thrown out and there were several other people, but I cannot speak of any of my school comrades.</span> <span id="s55">I don’t recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">FW: Do you remember any discussions around this time with either this friend, or other girls about the situation in Nuremberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">GR: No I don’t, but I’ll tell you another thing that happened.</span> <span id="s58">It was either in the first or second grade of the lycium, we had a math test and I very clearly remember we had some aggregates to figure out.</span> <span id="s59">And after the test, when the test came back the figures were put on the blackboard, the correct answers were put on the blackboard.</span> <span id="s60">After the decimal there were six or seven ciphers or whatever you call them, whatever you call them in English.</span> <span id="s61">I was handed my paper back and I had a failure on it.</span> <span id="s62">And another girl, I knew I had every single answer correct because I had kept on another little piece of paper, as was our custom, our answers we kept.</span> <span id="s63">And we weren’t handed our papers back, we were only told our marks.</span> <span id="s64">And we used to compare.</span> <span id="s65">I was a very good mathematician, with a non-Jewish girl in class.</span> <span id="s66">And we had compared our answers and the two of us varied in one of the points behind the decimal, one of the answers, and I had the answer that was on the blackboard, and I had a failure, I had a four.</span> <span id="s67">We were graded one to four or one to five, I don’t know anymore because they changed that around at one point too.</span> <span id="s68">And she got up and said to the teacher I got a one and she got a four, and she has the answer that is on the blackboard.</span> <span id="s69">I cannot let a Jew be first in class, was the answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">FW: How did you feel about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">GR: How can you feel about something like that?</span> <span id="s72">How can you feel about something like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">FW: Did you have any other such.</span> <span id="s74">.</span> <span id="s75">?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">GR: At that time my mother went to the director of the school.</span> <span id="s77">There was absolute proof of what happened here.</span> <span id="s78">The teacher was known to be the Nazi in school, and I did get the one on my report card.</span> <span id="s79">This did not ever happen again.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">FW: Do you remember going home that afternoon?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">GR: No, I don’t.</span> <span id="s82">I have no recollection of my feelings.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">FW: Because you mention that your mother went to school, so I assume that.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">GR: I cannot say that I have a recollection of my feelings.</span> <span id="s85">I only felt very strongly for the girl who had the guts to get up and say that.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">FW: After Hitler came to power...</span></p> <p><span id="s87">GR: Hitler was in power at that time, that’s why I’m thinking this must have happened in second grade rather than the first year.</span> <span id="s88">I don’t think this would have happened in the first year, because the first year was 1933, so I think this must have been 1934, but I have never bothered to really go into it.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">FW: As Hitler came to power, and as his power became stronger, did you notice a difference in the attitude of the gentile kids in school towards.</span> <span id="s90">.</span> <span id="s91">?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">GR: They didn’t know us any more.</span> <span id="s93">They were afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">FW: What made them afraid, that you noticed?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">GR: Some of us did h ave, or some of my friends in class were closer to some of the non-Jewish girls than I was.</span> <span id="s96">And they would like to go to their houses, but they were afraid to be caught, because they were being threatened.</span> <span id="s97">They had to join the BDM, but they were threatened that they could not be seen with Jews or whatever not.</span> <span id="s98">I mean exactly the threats, what the threats were verbatim, I would not know.</span> <span id="s99">I couldn’t tell you that.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">FW: Did you, I mean children like to belong, and when you saw all these girls going to BDM meetings, didn’t you?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">GR: Yes.</span> <span id="s102">I belonged to the [ ] or whatever, I’ve forgotten the exact name.</span> <span id="s103">To my knowledge it was the non-zionist youth group</span></p> <p><span id="s104">FW: Did this spring up during the early Nazi years?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">GR: Whether it existed before or not, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">FW: But most of the Jewish girls did go?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">GR: Yes, we all belonged to that.</span> <span id="s108">I mean there was a zionist, there was another group.</span> <span id="s109">I can’t remember the name.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">FW: Do you remember in going to these youth group activities and so on, do you remember any discussion of feelings?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">GR: I don’t think we had discussions of feelings.</span> <span id="s112">Let me put it this way.</span> <span id="s113">I’m under the impression at that time particularly, feelings of people were never of great importance.</span> <span id="s114">I think the feeling, that part of the human being, is much more cultivated here than it ever was in Europe.</span> <span id="s115">You did your job because you had a job to do, you weren’t asked whether you liked your job or not.</span> <span id="s116">I mean the main thing is I’m not going now as a child, but my whole concept as I recall and seem to remember of them, you were doing things because you wanted to earn money, but nobody would defer money to feelings.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">FW: But at this time, when you were in this group, what types of activities did you engage in?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">GR: Sports.</span> <span id="s119">Literature.</span> <span id="s120">Music.</span> <span id="s121">Maybe we even did some handiwork.</span> <span id="s122">I have forgotten to tell you the truth.</span> <span id="s123">It was just a gathering of the people so that we had something to do together.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">FW: What did you father do for a living?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">GR: My father was in the management of the glass industry.</span> <span id="s126">The flat glass industry.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">FW: Was that a big industry in Nuremberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">GR: Yes.</span> <span id="s129">He was director of a flat glass [ ], the manager of a firm that belonged to the [ ].</span></p> <p><span id="s130">FW: How did Hitler’s rise in power affect him?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">GR: It affected him greatly inasmuch at one point he had to, though he had a lifelong contract he had to retire.</span> <span id="s132">But that was only in 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">FW: But up until that time do you remember how he felt about Hitler’s being in power in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">GR: Well let’s face it, who liked it.</span> <span id="s135">Everybody was against it.</span> <span id="s136">How could a Jew be for it?</span> <span id="s137">I cannot.</span> <span id="s138">I was very much in my house a child.</span> <span id="s139">I don’t think I was ever present at any adult discussion.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">FW: I don’t think that was particularly unusual.</span> <span id="s141">Do you remember ever thinking, Hitler won’t last long?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">GR: Now that is something that has come up in discussions here.</span> <span id="s143">I cannot say I remember it as of then.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">FW: That’s what I wanted to know.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">GR: People here have said how many of us, not particularly that it would have been my parents, do know of conversations that Hitler would last that long.</span> <span id="s146">I also know, and these are only conversations that I recall here, is that people would say (in German) but I also have to say that due to my father’s business position, he was not forced, he never felt forced to get out at an earlier date, unfortunately.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">FW: So in other words, they did not think of emigration until after 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">GR: They had thought of it before.</span> <span id="s149">They must have definitely thought of it before, but his people always said we’ll transfer you or something like that if we have to, and didn’t figure it would work out, I don’t think that his business connections, which were all non-Jewish, ever thought it would come to this point.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">FW: When you say his business connections were all non-Jewish, did he also socialize with these business connections?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">GR: No.</span> <span id="s152">These business connections were not in Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s153">My father worked in Furth.</span> <span id="s154">They were sitting in [ ].</span> <span id="s155">These people who had the say in what to do, the chairman of the board and all this all in [ ].</span> <span id="s156">They of necessity would not socialize with them because they were not there.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">FW: I mean of the people who were in Furth or Nuremberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">GR: I only know, whether my parents formerly socialized, I have no recollection of the years 1922 to 1932.</span> <span id="s159">I was too young.</span> <span id="s160">That I would not know.</span> <span id="s161">I was always with my kinderfraulein.</span> <span id="s162">I never had anything to do with my parents’ social life.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">FW: When you say kinderfraulein, you had like a governess?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">GR: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">FW: Taking care of you.</span> <span id="s166">Were you an only child?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">GR: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">FW: To you knowledge did your parents go to the theater.</span> <span id="s169">.</span> <span id="s170">?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">GR: Always.</span> <span id="s172">The opera, the theater.</span> <span id="s173">Always.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">FW: Did they encourage you in your younger years?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">GR: Yes, very much so.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">FW: You mentioned.</span> <span id="s177">.</span> <span id="s178">?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">GR: I mean I went to all the children’s performances of the opera, the theater.</span> <span id="s180">There were children’s performances.</span> <span id="s181">I was taken to the opera.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">FW: Were you ever stopped from going to the theater or the opera?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">GR: That must have happened at a point, but also here I have no personal recollection.</span> <span id="s184">When they lost their subscription to these things I don’t know, but I know they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">FW: You mentioned that you finished the lycium, and then why at that point did you decide to go to this academy in Darmstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">GR: Because we were figuring out that it would give me a trade or profession that I possibly could utilize here.</span> <span id="s187">I should be utilized.</span> <span id="s188">It was an excellent field.</span> <span id="s189">There was only one hitch to it when I came here.</span> <span id="s190">I had very high recommendation from a man who is a world renowned in the field at that point.</span> <span id="s191">And I had a recommendation to a professor at the university of Minnesota, which specialized in this field.</span> <span id="s192">And the gentleman wrote me the loveliest letter, invited me to come, invited me to take any course that I wished to take.</span> <span id="s193">They wi ll take care of me, anything that I wanted to do, however in all fairness, he would dissuade me from continuing this study because this was a field that was completely, 100 per cent masculine, and he did not think that any female within the foreseeable future had a chance to break into it.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">FW: This letter you received in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">GR: Here.</span> <span id="s196">After having left Germany.</span> <span id="s197">I only wrote to this professor here.</span> <span id="s198">When I arrived here.</span> <span id="s199">There was an interlude while I was in Scotland.</span> <span id="s200">We are now getting, I mean if you want to go chronologically let’s skip that part.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">FW: Okay.</span> <span id="s202">We’ll go back.</span> <span id="s203">When you went to this academy, when did you decide to do this.</span> <span id="s204">Do you have any idea what year you went to Darmstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">GR: In 1938.</span> <span id="s206">I graduated from the Lycium in 1938.</span> <span id="s207">April ‘38 or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">FW: So by then you realized that you were going to leave Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">GR: Oh we knew.</span> <span id="s210">There was no question that we would, the question was to when.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">FW: When did you decide to leave Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">GR: I cannot tell you when my parents decided that.</span> <span id="s213">I had no part in it and I cannot tell you.</span> <span id="s214">My life was presented to me by my parents.</span> <span id="s215">I had no say, nothing asked, except that they knew that I had the ability for Physics and Mathematics.</span> <span id="s216">I had additional private lessons in Chemistry because my school was not training me well enough for what we were doing.</span> <span id="s217">What I was preparing myself for so that...</span></p> <p><span id="s218">FW: What were your last years in the lycium, just before 1938 like?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">GR: I hated it, because I felt very unwanted.</span> <span id="s220">I had several teachers who didn’t like, there was another mathematics teacher who just couldn’t stand that a Jew could do mathematics better than some of the others.</span> <span id="s221">It was not pleasant.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">FW: When you say you did not feel wanted, how did that make itself known to you in school?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">GR: You felt a hostility by teachers more than by students.</span> <span id="s224">By certain teachers.</span> <span id="s225">Although other teachers were as straight, as correct as they could be.</span> <span id="s226">If you wanted to answer a question, I mean we were, our classroom was different from the school here.</span> <span id="s227">If the question was asked we had to raise our hand.</span> <span id="s228">Now at times we would be totally ignored.</span> <span id="s229">Maybe if nobody else could answer the question we would be called on.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">FW You mentioned that the teachers were worse than the students.</span> <span id="s231">Did you ever receive any support from the students?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">GR: No.</span> <span id="s233">I don’t think there was any more discussion of receiving support.</span> <span id="s234">The only support I got was the one incident that I mentioned.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">FW: Did anyone ever, students or.</span> <span id="s236">.</span> <span id="s237">?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">GR: I was never overtly any more cheated in any which way.</span> <span id="s239">It was not done.</span> <span id="s240">It was done in a very subtle way.</span> <span id="s241">Just being a non-person.</span> <span id="s242">Let me put it that way.</span> <span id="s243">Being a non-person.</span> <span id="s244">That’s I guess what I felt, many a time.</span> <span id="s245">That’s a feeling that I could recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">FW: Do you remember ever seeing signs “Juden [ ]?”</span></p> <p><span id="s247">GR: You saw them daily, not once, but a thousand times.</span> <span id="s248">I mean there was graffiti like that.</span> <span id="s249">I mean that was the first graffiti I ever saw.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">FW: Did you think of yourself, you were a young girl, and having been subjected since 1933, you were 11 years old to mounting pressures or signs, whatever it is, did you feel yourself something different, or something.</span> <span id="s251">.</span> <span id="s252">?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">GR: No.</span> <span id="s254">Never.</span> <span id="s255">I came from a very supportive home, but on the other had a very, very strict father, an exceedingly strict father to whom the grades in school meant a great deal and you studied, studied you head off to get it.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">FW: Did you think ever, did you come from an orthodox or an observant home?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">GR: No.</span> <span id="s258">Absolutely not.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">FW: Liberal?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">GR: Yes.</span> <span id="s261">Exceedingly liberal.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">FW: Did the thought ever cross your mind why the Jews should be singled out by the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">GR: No.</span> <span id="s264">I mean you are asking me what I thought then.</span> <span id="s265">I don’t think other than in religious school discussions I don’t think my friends and I were discussing it, but I cannot recall, I cannot give you an answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">FW: When you saw these signs ”Juden [ ]” on stores, did you ever go in?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">GR: I doubt it very much.</span> <span id="s268">I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">FW: Do you remember seeing any parades or any, I mean Nuremberg was the beginning?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">GR: Well, we lived two blocks behind the Reich { } galinder, that will answer you.</span> <span id="s271">We saw them strut day in and day out.</span> <span id="s272">We were there when they had [ ] so I saw more than I ever hoped to see, as a matter of fact we saw last night on television I don’t recall which program it was, they showed yugoslavia, was it on the 60 Minutes program on Sunday?</span> <span id="s273">They showed Tito and they showed his army, and they were goose-stepping and I got the shudders.</span> <span id="s274">I said to my husband, oh, I can’t take it, because I remember the sound, and this is a sound that gives me a pain.</span> <span id="s275">I experienced that same thing.</span> <span id="s276">My father had a secretary who was a [?}</span> <span id="s277">.</span> <span id="s278">She had a source where she knew things that were going to happen and she told them in advance.</span> <span id="s279">My husband and I were in Europe for the first time in 1962.</span> <span id="s280">We were in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s281">We got a phone call saying that the woman is fighting for her life.</span> <span id="s282">She is in the hospital.</span> <span id="s283">All she’s doing, she’s asking for me.</span> <span id="s284">Would we come?</span> <span id="s285">So we went into Germany.</span> <span id="s286">it was the first time.</span> <span id="s287">We crossed the border in the train in Achen, or near Achen.</span> <span id="s288">And the people who looked at the passports, the border patrol, wore boots, and walked with the same step.</span> <span id="s289">I was shaking when this man came and asked for my passport, and he realized what was what, and he apologized to me.</span> <span id="s290">He said please, don’t be afraid.</span> <span id="s291">You have no reason to be afraid here any more.</span> <span id="s292">He saw my passport, he saw my name, he saw where I was born, and I was shaking.</span> <span id="s293">But what caused me to shake was that footstep.</span> <span id="s294">There I’m traumatized.</span> <span id="s295">There’s no question about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">FW: You mentioned Reich... Could you describe just a little bit what events took place on that kind of a day?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">GR: It was gathering of all the Nazi organizations, they would march with flags waving, hundreds of flags, and singing, and then they would all stand and listen to Streicher and whoever else was there speak.</span> <span id="s298">If you have ever seen, I’m sure in your interviews you have come across the Schturmer.</span> <span id="s299">If you grow up with this.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">FW: Did you read Der Schturmer?</span> <span id="s301">Did you as a 15 or 16 year old?</span></p> <p><span id="s302">GR: I saw Der Schtermer.</span> <span id="s303">I saw all the lies in there, and I saw the distortions and I saw the caricatures and frankly speaking, once in a while when I see some caricatures of Henry Kissinger, I haven’t seen him since he was a child, I see this caricature and I say that’s Hitler, Scht...</span></p> <p><span id="s304">FW: Did you also have Volkischer Bobachter?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">GR: I mean they were around.</span> <span id="s306">We didn’t buy or subscribe to either, naturally.</span> <span id="s307">You couldn’t help seeing them.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">FW: You mentioned that by this time you were pretty sure you were going to emigrate.</span> <span id="s309">how did your parents go about trying to get out of Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">GR: I do know that my parents got affidavits to come over here, but they also knew that their number was too high, and so my father through his business connections was eventually given a chance to go to Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">FW: Through what we would call a transfer?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">GR: No it was not a transfer because they couldn’t get him working papers.</span> <span id="s313">It was only very temporary asylum until they could arrange to get to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">FW: Were you still in Nuremberg on Crystal Night.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">GR: Yes, I was in Darmstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">FW: And your parents were still in Nuremberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s317">GR: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">FW: What happened.</span> <span id="s319">.</span> <span id="s320">?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">GR: Now, this involves the secretary, again most likely, who will never admit to it, but it could hardly have been anybody else.</span> <span id="s322">I mean I was not at home, but this is what happened to my parents.</span> <span id="s323">We lived in a house with a pretty large garden, and had a huge dog.</span> <span id="s324">The dog was on a chain, permitting it to get to the front door and to the back door, but not to the garden gate.</span> <span id="s325">And my parents got a phone call in the early, I believe it was after midnight.</span> <span id="s326">My parents were sound asleep.</span> <span id="s327">And a voice said to them, my father who answered the phone - muffle your bell and let your dog off the chain, and hung up.</span> <span id="s328">And this is what my father did.</span> <span id="s329">My parents had no idea why or what.</span> <span id="s330">Some time later they saw because they could watch from a point, without being seen of course, hordes of Nazis in uniform, come to our neighbors, ring the bell, break down the doors, enter the house and after awhile come out.</span> <span id="s331">They watched them approach our house.</span> <span id="s332">They rang the bell, but of course the bell made very little sound because it was muffled.</span> <span id="s333">The dog started a rampage, and they moved on.</span> <span id="s334">The next morning my parents found blood at the front gate.</span> <span id="s335">Why they did not shoot the dog, why they moved on, nobody will ever know.</span> <span id="s336">My parents were about the only people unhurt, or untouched in the whole neighborhood.</span> <span id="s337">The houses were destroyed.</span> <span id="s338">And this is why as I mentioned to you I went to Germany in 1962, and this is my reason for going.</span> <span id="s339">Whenever I go to Europe, I go to see this woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">FW: Understandable.</span> <span id="s341">You were in Darmstadt at the time, what happened to you on.</span> <span id="s342">.</span> <span id="s343">?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">GR: Absolutely nothing.</span> <span id="s345">I had gone, I knew nothing of the Crystal Night.</span> <span id="s346">The next morning I went to my lab, I went to school, I went to the [ ] Institute, and only after I got back, I stayed with a Jewish family, did I find out what had happened.</span> <span id="s347">And I was told your parents are on the way to get you.</span> <span id="s348">And I would imagine this is when my father told his people in the Rhineland, I am going.</span> <span id="s349">They did not want them to go, because my parents came by car, picked me up and we went up to Achen.</span> <span id="s350">And they roadblocks all over for Jews.</span> <span id="s351">Again, there’s a miracle.</span> <span id="s352">We were never stopped.</span> <span id="s353">We got to Achen.</span> <span id="s354">My father saw, I remember very well that my mother and I went to the Achen Cathedral.</span> <span id="s355">I had never seen it, and it was felt that we would be safe there.</span> <span id="s356">And my father went into conference with his people.</span> <span id="s357">I don’t remember whether we went to Cologne or not, because i mentioned the Rhineland before.</span> <span id="s358">Because some of the people were in Cologne.</span> <span id="s359">I know definitely that at that point we were in Achen, and we went back to Nuremberg, but I never went back to school, to Darmstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">FW: All right.</span> <span id="s361">When you went to the Cathedral did you wait there for your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">GR: No recollection.</span> <span id="s363">I have absolutely no recollection.</span> <span id="s364">I think I once asked my mother what did we do in Achen, where were we, and I think my mother does not recollect either.</span> <span id="s365">It was so traumatic that we probably did block it out.</span> <span id="s366">But I recollect going to the Cathedral in Achen.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">FW: When you say it was so traumatic I can imagine the amount of fear.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">GR: Fear is not the word for it.</span> <span id="s369">Fear is not the word for it and I frankly think I still have some emotional fear of certain things today.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">FW: When you say fear did you feel it was a life threatening situation?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">GR: Always.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">FW: Do you remember your father’s reaction as you were driving from Darmstadt to Achen?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">GR: No I don’t.</span> <span id="s374">I will also tell you I had an exceptionally intelligent father, an exceedingly disciplined man.</span> <span id="s375">If you want to describe my father I have to describe him one way whether that’s a compliment or not I don’t know.</span> <span id="s376">Though he was a Bavarian, he was a typical Prussian officer.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">FW: What about your mother at this time, what do you remember about her reaction after Crystal Night?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">GR: Very lucky.</span> <span id="s379">Except mother was always here for me.</span> <span id="s380">She was very protective.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">FW: How did she try to protect you?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">GR: How did she try?</span> <span id="s383">I never analyzed it.</span> <span id="s384">I always felt warm and safe when I was with her, but that’s about all.</span> <span id="s385">How or why, I’ve never gone into psychological analysis.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">FW: I was just looking for her reactions to that time too.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">GR: My mother was part of my father and my mother did what my father said.</span> <span id="s388">My mother was a rather educated woman, for that time.</span> <span id="s389">She had gone to the Gymnasium, but married before she finished, I mean before she went on to higher... There were few people who had finished Gymnasium.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">FW: Let me ask you.</span> <span id="s391">You mentioned during the time you had finished the Lycium you were in this Institute in Darmstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">GR: It was only about half a year.</span> <span id="s393">It was only from about April ‘38 ‘til November.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">FW: Was this permissible for Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">GR: I was taken.</span> <span id="s396">They knew I was a Jew, the people there.</span> <span id="s397">However I had a totally non-jewish name, and by that they could probably get away with it covering it towards other.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">FW: What was your maiden name?</span></p> <p><span id="s399">GR: [unreadable] So nobody per se ever suspected it.</span> <span id="s400">And it was not known that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s401">No question about it that I made a point of not letting it come out.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">FW: But you say they knew when they accepted you?</span></p> <p><span id="s403">GR: No question about it.</span> <span id="s404">I even believe that the professor, I mean the man who ran this Institute [ ] was a half Jew himself.</span> <span id="s405">I believe that.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">FW: So you think that there was some.</span> <span id="s407">.</span> <span id="s408">?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">GR: The rest of the family was not Jewish, but I believe and his name which I will not mention, would indicate it to me, and I have a hunch he was.</span> <span id="s410">Whether it was known to my parents or not, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">FW: When you mentioned that your father came back from his meeting in Achen and you went back to Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s412">.</span> <span id="s413">?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">GR: I believe at that point my father did not go back to work ever again.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">FW: How long were you in Nuremberg before you left Germany, at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">GR: I left on May 3, 1939.</span> <span id="s417">My parents left later.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">FW: In other words this was a half a year more after Crystal Night.</span> <span id="s419">During that half a year after Crystal Night.</span> <span id="s420">.</span> <span id="s421">?</span></p> <p><span id="s422">GR: I went to volksschular, Berufschuler I think, let me figure out.</span> <span id="s423">I was not yet sixteen years old.</span> <span id="s424">And to my knowledge you had to go to school until you were sixteen, and therefore I was forced to go to this Berufschuler, or whatever not, it was part of the volksschuler, because we were finished already.</span> <span id="s425">I went there for a couple of months.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">FW: Was this set up by the H___stein or the Reich___ for purposes of training you to.</span> <span id="s427">.</span> <span id="s428">?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">GR: I have no idea.</span> <span id="s430">The Yiddushevolksschuler existed all along.</span> <span id="s431">This was the Jewish lower school and in Furte it was the Jewish realschuler.</span> <span id="s432">Why it was called this I have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">FW: Did you feel, how did you feel about the quality of your education at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">GR: What I was doing there was just wasting time and we all knew it.</span> <span id="s435">Everybody knew it.</span> <span id="s436">It was gathering with friends, let’s put it that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">FW: With your father so intent on good grades and a good education, how did this, how did knowledge of this kind of an education affect him?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">GR: It wasn’t a question of education at all at this point, this was an interim thing that had nothing to do, it never came up.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">FW: You mentioned before that your parents knew that their number was too high, what did they do to try and save themselves at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">GR: Well, they knew that his business associates were making the arrangements to get him to Belgium.</span> <span id="s441">It was a very, very difficult thing, but since these people were all pretty high in industry, they had government connections to get him into Belgium, and he got a very small subsistence in Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">FW: During that half a year after Crystal Night did things get worse in Nuremberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">GR: I don’t know if they could get worse anymore anyway.</span> <span id="s444">It was horrendous.</span> <span id="s445">I mean you couldn’t go any place.</span> <span id="s446">And I have only one recollection, always hearing these footsteps.</span> <span id="s447">In front of our house people were passing, and they all wore these boots.</span> <span id="s448">This is something I remember lying awake at night and hearing these footsteps.</span> <span id="s449">You always had the fear, are they coming to get you.</span> <span id="s450">Are they coming to kill you?</span> <span id="s451">What are they doing next?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">FW: After Crystal night, I mean they took many of the men.</span> <span id="s453">.</span> <span id="s454">?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">GR: My family was not taken, but my friends and relatives, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">FW: Did you see many of them coming back, returning, did you ever hear stories of what had happened to them.</span> <span id="s457">.</span> <span id="s458">?</span></p> <p><span id="s459">GR: Yes.</span> <span id="s460">We also know that one man, I remember quite clearly that one of my father’s friends or acquaintances was so badly, either he was already in a hospital at that time, or he was hurt in the hospital, but as a result of the Crystal night he died.</span> <span id="s461">I do not know was he so badly hurt and got to a hospital or was he taken out of bed in a hospital, because they did anything and all.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">FW: When you say you couldn’t go anywhere, you literally did not go out of the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">GR: Oh yes, you could go out of the house, but you couldn’t go to the theater, you couldn’t go.</span> <span id="s464">.</span> <span id="s465">, except for seeing your friends within your house, now I am not even sure, and I don’t know it whether these jewish organizations even existed after Crystal night like the D____, I don’t even recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">FW: Was you life mostly seeing your friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">GR: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">FW: How did you, you mentioned you went to Scotland, how did that come about?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">GR: All right.</span> <span id="s470">Friends of my parents emigrated to London.</span> <span id="s471">Lived in an apartment building, and one day a neighbor’s son who was a Methodist minister came to them and said, I’m getting married in a few months, my parents have this large apartment here, they are in a position to rescue a girl from Germany.</span> <span id="s472">I mean we had decided that we want to do something, and the best thing is we feel is to get a German Jewish girl.</span> <span id="s473">They will have a young person in the house, she can possibly be helpful to them in a little way and that’s what we’d like to do.</span> <span id="s474">These friends mentioned the name of someone and the arrangements were made that that friend, that child would come to London.</span> <span id="s475">And some months later, I don’t think this girl had arrived yet because they weren’t married yet, I don’t think so, the Scottish fiancee of this Methodist minister came to visit, heard about this arrangement, how fantastic, that’s a marvelous idea, my father just passed away, I will be married in the near future, how about my mother and my sister will be the only ones in that large house in Scotland.</span> <span id="s476">Let me go and speak to your neighbors.</span> <span id="s477">And I was the person that was contacted.</span> <span id="s478">My first contact with my Scottish foster mother was the loveliest of lovely letters you would ever want to read.</span> <span id="s479">That was followed by weekly letters of the two daughters.</span> <span id="s480">Dear Sis we are waiting for you.</span> <span id="s481">Can’t wait ‘til you come.</span> <span id="s482">I must say that due to this fantastic human endeavor of these people, some of my horrendous experiences in Germany are blocked out.</span> <span id="s483">Because I had the good fortune of seeing another side of humanity, after having seen this animal society I saw really the [ ].</span></p> <p><span id="s484">FW: When you first got the news of such a situation existing, how did you feel about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s485">GR: I felt very leery, very apprehensive, and very excited.</span> <span id="s486">But as it happened my girlfriend who just lived in the second house from me was also in the position, they had friends in Glasgow, these friends contacted people in another little town in Scotland and this girl knew that she was going to go to a town Ayr, which by the way is near the Prestwick airport, at that time Prestwick was nothing, but today anyone who goes to Europe knows the Prestwick airport, and when that letter came to me from Scotland I was invited to come.</span> <span id="s487">We went to a map and I remember blurting out, we’ll be eight miles apart.</span> <span id="s488">It made all the difference in the world.</span> <span id="s489">If you want to ask me how I left I will answer that if you want to go chronologically.</span> <span id="s490">Yes I’d rather go chronologically.</span> <span id="s491">It’s to your advantage to go chronologically because you want to know how.</span> <span id="s492">Now I can come with feelings, because prior to that I have no recollection.</span> <span id="s493">I went out of Germany with a kinder transport.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">FW: How did you arrange that?</span></p> <p><span id="s495">GR: My parents did I have no knowledge how that was being arranged.</span> <span id="s496">So did my girlfriend who left about six weeks before me.</span> <span id="s497">Another dear friend went to England go her aunt, but I think she also left with the children’s transport.</span> <span id="s498">So leaving with the children’s transport meant relatively little except that when my parents took me to the station I had the feeling that I would never see them again.</span> <span id="s499">That is also something that is still in me.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">FW: I remember your mentioning seeing “Fiddler on the Roof.”</span></p> <p><span id="s501">GR: That’s exactly it, when that girl sang Fiddler on the Roof as I mentioned at that meeting, my mother had given me tickets for “Fiddler on the Roof” as a present.</span> <span id="s502">And I believe I am the only one who did not enjoy “Fiddler on the Roof,” because it was emotionally too much for me, because when I saw that girl sitting at the railroad station, I just, it was me all over again.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">FW: You remembered yourself sitting at.</span> <span id="s504">.</span> <span id="s505">?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">GR: I was standing at the platform going into that train, and the first few minutes on that train.</span> <span id="s507">I was very attached to my parents and I never thought I would see them again.</span> <span id="s508">At the time, and I also know emotionally I was afraid to cross the border.</span> <span id="s509">What would they do at the border?</span> <span id="s510">Now I had traveled out of the country during Hitler and never really had any problems, but I had heard such horror stories, but none of it occurred.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">FW: When you said you had traveled out of the country, where had you gone?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">GR: We had gone to Switzerland before, and we had gone to Italy.</span> <span id="s513">We had gone on a Mediterranean cruise, as a matter of fact I had spent my fourteenth birthday on the Acropolis, which was the strangest thing because I had dreamt I would spend my fourteenth birthday on the Acropolis, and I did not know until the day we left on the trip.</span> <span id="s514">I was picked up at school by my father's chauffeur and was told I have to take you to one of the stores here.</span> <span id="s515">Your mother is waiting for you.</span> <span id="s516">There my mother was sitting, waiting for me having picked out a couple of dresses, and said, try them on, okay I’ll take this and I'll take that.</span> <span id="s517">I was bewildered and she said to me we are leaving for a trip to Italy and the Mediterranean.</span> <span id="s518">We are going to Palestine on a Mediterranean cruise and as it happened that boat docked in Pereus on August 5.</span> <span id="s519">I spent my 14th birthday on the Acropolis.</span> <span id="s520">And this dream I had this girlfriend, the same girl who lived two doors away, we were history buffs and geography buffs.</span> <span id="s521">We would always, and we were so familiar with the Acropolis.</span> <span id="s522">And I had told her months ago, do you know what I dreamt, so when it happened it was just beyond me.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">FW: The reason I asked whether you had been out of the country during the Hitler years was, did your parents at that time make any effort, was this just a vacation?</span></p> <p><span id="s524">GR: A vacation.</span> <span id="s525">My parents traveled at all times.</span> <span id="s526">My parents were in America without thought of coming back.</span> <span id="s527">That was in 1933 or 1934.</span> <span id="s528">My parents traveled all over all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">FW: But while you were on this, children’s, to get back to this children’s transport, what helped you get over those first moments, those first hard moments of separation?</span></p> <p><span id="s530">GR: I think once we had been over the border I regained my composure.</span> <span id="s531">I knew I was going to see my uncle in London.</span> <span id="s532">I had an uncle, but he was in no financial position to support me.</span> <span id="s533">And I knew I was going to go there, and I knew I was going to stay with them for a few days before going to Scotland.</span> <span id="s534">But I had such fantastic letters.</span> <span id="s535">These people from Scotland.</span> <span id="s536">It was such a dream, that once I realized I was physically safe and didn’t have to cope anymore with the physical fear, and I only had to cope with the idea that I will never see my parents again, that I could manage that.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">FW: That’s quite an idea to cope with that you’ll never see your parents again in terms of ...</span></p> <p><span id="s538">GR: At that point I felt they would never get out of Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">FW: You knew though that they were making plans?</span></p> <p><span id="s540">GR: I knew that they were making plans, but there were so many hitches and so many things which my father’s friends had not anticipated.</span> <span id="s541">They had thought they only had to open their mouth and here you go until they found out differently, and it didn’t work out.</span> <span id="s542">There was no malintent or anything of that nature, there was bureaucracy involved.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">FW: When you were on this children’s transport were most of the children your own age?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">GR: I cannot answer your question.</span> <span id="s545">I do not have the faintest idea today, who was on that children’s transport.</span> <span id="s546">I think I was so involved with myself.</span> <span id="s547">This in retrospect, but there’s also a block there.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">FW: You got on the train at Nuremberg?</span> <span id="s549">How did you proceed from there?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">GR: I believe we went out via Hock van Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">FW: So you went out through Holland and then across the Channel?</span></p> <p><span id="s552">GR: Yes.</span> <span id="s553">The border was Holland.</span> <span id="s554">But where exactly...</span></p> <p><span id="s555">FW: Were you stopped at the border?</span></p> <p><span id="s556">GR: Oh definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">FW: What.</span> <span id="s558">.</span> <span id="s559">?</span></p> <p><span id="s560">GR: I do not believe there was a physical search.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">FW: Did they realize it was all children?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">GR: I do not know.</span> <span id="s563">I cannot tell you anything whatsoever.</span> <span id="s564">I even cannot remember my arrival in London and my meeting my uncle.</span> <span id="s565">I know I was in my uncle’s house for a week or so, and I remember very clearly my trip to Scotland.</span> <span id="s566">it was arranged.</span> <span id="s567">We had talked on the phone.</span> <span id="s568">It was arranged that I wear a certain outfit and it was either red or a white carnation was pinned to my lapel.</span> <span id="s569">I believe it was red, because I seem to visualize the girls being at the station in Glasgow with red carnations on.</span> <span id="s570">The two sisters.</span> <span id="s571">One wore a navy blue suit and the other a black and white checked suit.</span> <span id="s572">I see them as clearly as anything because they were standing right where the car stopped.</span> <span id="s573">They knew in which car I’d be and they knew exactly where to stand, and there they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">FW: Had you met the sister who was marrying the Methodist minister?</span></p> <p><span id="s575">GR: No, she was one of them.</span> <span id="s576">So there they stood.</span> <span id="s577">Hi Sis, so finally you arrive, and that was it.</span> <span id="s578">They were very concerned about the trip, whether I was hungry, whether I was well, whether I wanted to rest awhile before I went to Troon.</span> <span id="s579">No, no, I’ll go on, whatever you say.</span> <span id="s580">I was not scared.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">FW: For myself, just in thinking about how I would feel, did you feel very homesick then?</span></p> <p><span id="s582">GR: No.</span> <span id="s583">I think that the tremendous relief of the personal safety, and the concern about my parents didn’t let me be homesick.</span> <span id="s584">And I had never, as long as I stayed in Scotland, ever had any feeling of homesickness.</span> <span id="s585">I had the tremendous, I mean my main thought was my parents, my parents, but homesickness?</span> <span id="s586">Never.</span> <span id="s587">Because I had no cause.</span> <span id="s588">We got to Troon.</span> <span id="s589">I met my foster mother, a charming, what I would say an old lady by now, though she was not old really, but she was snow white, who told me in the first few minutes that she understands German, in emergency I may tell her, and she has all these dictionaries prepared, so there will be no problem for me to make myself understood.</span> <span id="s590">I spoke very broken English then.</span> <span id="s591">But she will not permit me to speak any German at any time because I was to learn English, and that was the sole thing that she wants from me.</span> <span id="s592">That she wants me to be able to relax, to breathe fresh air, to enjoy life, and all she can do to help me to get my parents out she will do.</span> <span id="s593">But I m ay not speak German, for my own sake.</span> <span id="s594">But I should feel safe in the knowledge that she understands it.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">FW: That must have been quite a relief.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">GR: Oh this woman was something else.</span> <span id="s597">She was a Quaker, though the children belonged to the Scottish High Church.</span> <span id="s598">I have never met such kindness, such wisdom, and she told me you can call me anything you wish to call me, but mother, that belongs to your mother.</span> <span id="s599">So I ask what is the name for mother in Scottish.</span> <span id="s600">So they told me it is either mither or in a somewhat more colloquial frame maw.</span> <span id="s601">So I said how about my calling you muthermoor?</span> <span id="s602">That was the name that stuck with her or stuck with me.</span> <span id="s603">This woman was known to my friends and my family in later years as muthermoor.</span> <span id="s604">Now I don’t know anymore was it a Tuesday or a Wednesday that I arrived.</span> <span id="s605">On the Friday the doorbell rang and she told me to go to the door and answer the door and I said how can I. I can’t speak English.</span> <span id="s606">I had English in school and I had private lessons, but still I felt very incompetent to open the door.</span> <span id="s607">She said go to the door, open it.</span> <span id="s608">You will know what to say, and I opened the door and my girlfriend stood there.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">FW: The one from two houses away?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">GR: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">FW: She was with a family?</span></p> <p><span id="s612">GR: She was with a family in Ayr.</span> <span id="s613">Eight miles away.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">FW: And they brought her over?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">GR: No.</span> <span id="s616">She had her brought.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">FW: The woman that you stayed with knew.</span> <span id="s618">.</span> <span id="s619">?</span></p> <p><span id="s620">GR: Knew and arranged to have her brought.</span> <span id="s621">That was in the very first days my experience there.</span> <span id="s622">So you can imagine what a contrast it was for me from in Germany.</span> <span id="s623">A contrast in humanity.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">FW: Did that strike you at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s625">GR: Very much so.</span> <span id="s626">Very much so.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">FW: You mentioned that you felt so much like a non-person in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">GR: And they helped me to feel like a person.</span> <span id="s629">That was their whole concept.</span> <span id="s630">I know I’m taking a lot of your time but there are more things coming which are incredible what this woman did.</span> <span id="s631">Saturday all the friends came.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">FW: This was the first Saturday after you met your friend Friday?</span></p> <p><span id="s633">GR: All the friends of the younger, the older sister who was getting married had very few friends in town because she had lived out of town, but she was back home now, she was a teacher.</span> <span id="s634">And she was just now shortly before she was getting married she was home for a few months.</span> <span id="s635">And the younger girl was in high school, and so everybody came in to welcome me.</span> <span id="s636">And so came one of the boyfriends of the younger daughter.</span> <span id="s637">The next thing i was told, I was out on the floor cold.</span> <span id="s638">I had absolutely fainted.</span> <span id="s639">They called the doctor who lived next door and he came in and I mean I came back and of course they were terribly concerned.</span> <span id="s640">They didn’t know what had happened.</span> <span id="s641">And it took me awhile to admit to them what had happened.</span> <span id="s642">The friend who walked in wore a tan shirt.</span> <span id="s643">It was like the Nazi shirt color.</span> <span id="s644">Needless to say neither he nor any of the friends every again wore a shirt of that size.</span> <span id="s645">But you can imagine my condition that that had happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">FW: Did you know at the time, did you realize what?</span></p> <p><span id="s647">GR: I knew what it was, ut I had, ti was a very difficult thing for me whether I should tell it or not, but then I felt they were concerned physically.</span> <span id="s648">That was wrong.</span> <span id="s649">I mean the doctor was there.</span> <span id="s650">The doctor was their friend, their next door neighbor so I felt I had to be honest.</span> <span id="s651">I didn’t want to mislead them into anything, so I told them the truth.</span> <span id="s652">But up to that point I myself had not realized how strongly it had affected me.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">FW: That’s why I asked you if you realized it was the tan shirt?</span></p> <p><span id="s654">GR: Yes I realized it, because the minute he walked in I saw myself go, so that was...</span></p> <p><span id="s655">FW: How long did you live with these people?</span></p> <p><span id="s656">GR: From May ‘39 to April ‘40.</span> <span id="s657">It was April ‘40.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">FW: How as it, what was it like to adjust to living with other people in someone else’s house?</span></p> <p><span id="s659">GR: Apparently very easy for me because I only have the most fantastic recollections.</span> <span id="s660">I was told what should I, what can I do in the house?</span> <span id="s661">I had first thought of myself coming as quasi like a maid, but I found out that was certainly not their idea at all.</span> <span id="s662">I felt grateful to come as a maid, but that was not their idea at all.</span> <span id="s663">To help around the house as everyone else was doing naturally, but nothing extraordinary.</span> <span id="s664">The only job that I was given, and that was my duty to take the dog for a walk.</span> <span id="s665">We were right across, you left the house through the garden, then came the road, and the other side was the beach.</span> <span id="s666">We were living at the seashore.</span> <span id="s667">And it was my duty, the dog had to walked for one full hour a day.</span> <span id="s668">I did not know that this was ploy to get me outside and walk for a day, for an hour, until much later.</span> <span id="s669">Everything they did was done with me in mind.</span> <span id="s670">They wanted me, the father had been the president of the golf club there.</span> <span id="s671">I had no idea what that meant.</span> <span id="s672">I could run around on that golf club.</span> <span id="s673">I hated that.</span> <span id="s674">They gave me lessons in golf.</span> <span id="s675">Forget it I don’t want to chase a ball.</span> <span id="s676">I didn’t know that the instructor then was a world famous golfer.</span> <span id="s677">I knew nothing.</span> <span id="s678">And at Troon a couple of years ago they had the world championship over there.</span> <span id="s679">I knew nothing.</span> <span id="s680">I had the run of that golf course, and I said thank you I’ll walk the dog on the beach and let me do it that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">FW: You mentioned that these were Quakers?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">GR: The mother was a Quaker and the daughters were brought up in the Scottish High Church.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">FW: And they knew you were Jewish.</span> <span id="s684">Were you ever.</span> <span id="s685">.</span> <span id="s686">?</span></p> <p><span id="s687">GR: I will give you without asking the question.</span> <span id="s688">We were on Saturday.</span> <span id="s689">The next day was Sunday.</span> <span id="s690">These people went to church every Sunday.</span> <span id="s691">Now I was told the synagogue was in Ayr where my girlfriend was eight miles.</span> <span id="s692">The problem was transportation to there.</span> <span id="s693">But they would try to arrange it if I insisted.</span> <span id="s694">I was welcome to go to church with them if I wanted to.</span> <span id="s695">If I didn’t want to they understood why I didn’t want to.</span> <span id="s696">So I told them as they know I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s697">I do not need a synagogue to pray.</span> <span id="s698">I pray every day when I walk along that beach.</span> <span id="s699">That’s my house of worship, but on the other hand I also want to know about their religion and since they asked me to be a member of their family my beliefs are so, I believe in one God and they believe actually in the same God, I see no reason why I can’t go to church with them.</span> <span id="s700">They were very pleased and I went to church with them.</span> <span id="s701">That next day, that Sunday, the sermon that I heard, I wish I had a copy of the sermon.</span> <span id="s702">I couldn’t get it because it was impromptu.</span> <span id="s703">All that service was not once the name of Jesus Christ.</span> <span id="s704">There was only reference to God and the Lord.</span> <span id="s705">And that the congregation was welcoming a stranger whom they hoped would be very happy in their midst.</span> <span id="s706">That everybody present has only one thing in mind, to help her recover what she has gone through.</span> <span id="s707">So all that was said.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">FW: Did it strike you as unusual?</span></p> <p><span id="s709">GR: Yes I realized it immediately.</span> <span id="s710">I realized it immediately because I had their hymnals and their prayer books in front of me.</span> <span id="s711">I could read English, though I couldn’t speak it.</span> <span id="s712">I understood what I was reading and of course I can read, and I noticed in every prayer he changed it to the Lord.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">FW: Did you every ask?</span></p> <p><span id="s714">GR: Oh yes I spoke.</span> <span id="s715">I met the minister many times over the year, and the minute they knew I was coming they decided to do that.</span> <span id="s716">That whole little town knew I was coming, and that whole little town was helping me.</span> <span id="s717">Another episode, I can’t say was it in the first week or the second week.</span> <span id="s718">The bus, we were living a little outside the big town.</span> <span id="s719">The bus passed the house and I was put on the bus and told to go to the grocery store to get the groceries.</span> <span id="s720">I was given a grocery list.</span> <span id="s721">I was told I should ask for the things, I may hand the list to the man.</span> <span id="s722">I must ask for it because I was supposed to speak, so I took the bus and the conductor was told I had to get off there and I was told the grocery store MacIntosh’s was right across the street you go in there.</span> <span id="s723">And I was scared, and you say that you come for Mrs. Jamison and you have an order and I will pick it up and I got around and went in there and worked very hand to get everything out, and little did I know that they had phoned in the order already, but they were training me and that went on all over.</span> <span id="s724">Now my big sister got married in July.</span> <span id="s725">My birthday was on August 5 and a couple of days before then, I don’t know exactly the dates Mrs. Jamison set me to the station which was a suburb of Troon, we were in Barasea.</span> <span id="s726">To the Barasea station and told me to go the station master to pick up a package for her.</span> <span id="s727">I mean I was always sent on errands like this.</span> <span id="s728">This meant walking for a while.</span> <span id="s729">I mean I was never given any degrading job to do or anything that the children wouldn’t do.</span> <span id="s730">And I got to the station master and by then I spoke English rather well, and I told him I was to pick up the package for Mrs. Jamison and he said oh the baggage car will be there go to the lamppost and stand at the lamppost and the man in the baggage car will give you the package for Mrs. Jamison.</span> <span id="s731">Well the train pulled in, but it wasn’t a baggage car that stopped.</span> <span id="s732">But the baggage car was a little farther back.</span> <span id="s733">So the train stopped and I walked toward the baggage car and I heard a voice call Gretel and my other girlfriend stepped out of the car of the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">FW: Your other girlfriend?</span></p> <p><span id="s735">GR: My other girlfriend who had gone to her aunt in Manchester, England.</span> <span id="s736">She stepped out of the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">FW: To visit you?</span> <span id="s738">These people had arranged it?</span></p> <p><span id="s739">GR: They had arranged it.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">FW: Amazing people.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">GR: And after I left for America this girl spent every vacation with them.</span> <span id="s742">Was was in England until after the war.</span> <span id="s743">She went through the war, she’s an R.N.</span> <span id="s744">She went through the war until she could come here and she came then to us until her family got settled and all that and her family.</span> <span id="s745">These were amazing people.</span> <span id="s746">You have on one had the experience of Hitler on the other hand that human experience, it is quite a change, quite a difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">FW: It’s interesting to see how different human beings can be.</span> <span id="s748">During all this time were you in contact with your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s749">GR: My parents got out on June 10, 1939.</span> <span id="s750">It was only, I took this out of chronological order.</span> <span id="s751">My parents, I got a telegram that they were out on June 10.</span> <span id="s752">They went to Belgium, they went to Brussels.</span> <span id="s753">And Mrs. Jamison arranged for me to telephone them in Brussels.</span> <span id="s754">And that was that.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">FW: How did you reunite with your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s756">GR: In Liverpool, England.</span> <span id="s757">My parents got permission to board a boat in Liverpool.</span> <span id="s758">To go from Belgium via England to board the boat.</span> <span id="s759">I came from Scotland.</span> <span id="s760">I spent my last few days in England with my girlfriend in Manchester, and then went to Liverpool.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">FW: Then your parents were able to stay in Belgium until their numbers came up?</span></p> <p><span id="s762">GR: Well once my parents were in Belgium, my fears were gone.</span> <span id="s763">And it was a totally different life from then, then came the uncertainty of what would happen in America.</span> <span id="s764">But I had such confidence in my father that nothing I said to Muthermoor one day in discussion, if my father’s health holds out I have nothing to worry about.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">FW: In terms of when you left Scotland...</span></p> <p><span id="s766">GR: I will tell you, when I left Scotland I walked, we had to board the boat we were in a hall or a room and you had to walk down steps, and I walked down the steps, and my father came up the steps and passed me, he didn’t recognize me.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">FW: In Liverpool?</span></p> <p><span id="s768">GR: I had gained so much weight, I looked so different, that he did not recognize me.</span> <span id="s769">He walked past me.</span> <span id="s770">That was a shock I got, but I guess the different food and all that, and the relaxation.</span> <span id="s771">The nervous strain was gone.</span> <span id="s772">Well I lost all this weight very fast again.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">FW: Do you also think that on his part it was the amount of tension he had gone through?</span></p> <p><span id="s774">GR: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s775">I must say looking at the pictures of me in the passport I don’t know if I would recognize myself today.</span> <span id="s776">Let me put it that way.</span> <span id="s777">No I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s778">I didn’t know it was as painful to recollect as it is.</span> <span id="s779">Very painful to recollect all of this.</span> <span id="s780">I haven’t done this in years.</span> <span id="s781">I have blocked it out to a certain extent.</span> <span id="s782">I’ve had this traumatic thing with my husband for the last few years so I so this past thing hasn’t come up anymore till you came along and said something and this discussion and the temple, and “The Fiddler on the Roof” and the reaction to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">FW: When you did reunite when was the first time you saw your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s784">GR: Two minutes after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">FW: She followed your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s786">GR: No.</span> <span id="s787">He went to look for me, then we turned around to look for Mother.</span> <span id="s788">No recollection actually.</span> <span id="s789">I mean we came here, were picked up at the boat by the parents of the girl who was eight miles away from me.</span> <span id="s790">We settled in Kew Gardens and started out.</span> <span id="s791">We had one room at first, and then got a little apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">FW: When you say you were picked up by the parents of the friend, did you stay with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s793">GR: No.</span> <span id="s794">They had taken a room for us in Kew Gardens.</span> <span id="s795">They lived in Kew Gardens and they had taken a room for us in Kew Gardens.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">FW: How did you all manage in the very beginning?</span> <span id="s797">I assume that your father only left with the ten Reichmarks?</span></p> <p><span id="s798">GR: Exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">FW: How did you manage those beginning days?</span></p> <p><span id="s800">GR: I don’t know whether friends helped.</span> <span id="s801">Really and truly I don’t know.</span> <span id="s802">I think I had thirty dollars or something.</span> <span id="s803">That was partly given me by my Scottish family.</span> <span id="s804">My mother also had some relatives who actually paid for my boat trip over here, but I got some money there.</span> <span id="s805">Where the money came from I, but I had thirty dollars.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">FW: But in any case thirty dollars wasn’t going to take you very far either.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">GR: I cannot answer that question.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">FW: Did you father get a job?</span></p> <p><span id="s809">GR: My father got a job very fast, also through pure coincidence, that the child of a friend of his was rooming with the son of someone.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">FW: What kind of job did he get?</span></p> <p><span id="s811">GR: I’m getting to it.</span> <span id="s812">The son knew, though he was a Czech, had heard about my father had been in the Czech glass industry, and had known who my father was, and he had known an old man here who for some time had been looking for someone who could go into his business, though he had two sons with him in the business, both geniuses with up to nineteen college degrees, but totally incapable of running a business.</span> <span id="s813">And he wanted somebody.</span> <span id="s814">But he told my father, you have to come in here as an office boy, sweep the floor, until I am ready to promote you.</span> <span id="s815">And that my sons don’t realize who you are.</span> <span id="s816">My father knew that eventually he could get a decent salary, eventually.</span> <span id="s817">Now this all worked out exceedingly well, and I don’t think that should be part of your, because that’s not me, that’s my father.</span> <span id="s818">It worked out exceedingly well for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">FW: Just one question on it.</span> <span id="s820">Do you remember the first few days when he went in to sweep the floors and so on, do you remember any?</span></p> <p><span id="s821">GR: No I cannot recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">FW: And do you remember, how about yourself what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s823">GR: I babysat.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">FW: In 1940 you were 18.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">GR: Yes.</span> <span id="s826">I was a baby sitter.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">FW: You babysat?</span></p> <p><span id="s828">GR: Yes.</span> <span id="s829">And my mother worked as a cleaning lady.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">FW: Speaking of that, how did your father feel about your mother working as a cleaning lady?</span></p> <p><span id="s831">GR: That was the worst experience that you could possibly imagine.</span> <span id="s832">We only had one thing in mind.</span> <span id="s833">We’ve got to get money whatever way we can legally make money and we will keep our dignity with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">FW: How did your mother feel about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s835">GR: The same way.</span> <span id="s836">There was no feeling sorry for ourselves.</span> <span id="s837">I think there was such a relief being reunited that I don’t ever remember hearing my parents feeling sorry for themselves.</span> <span id="s838">Being safe.</span> <span id="s839">And we had always known that my father no matter what he would touch, would succeed.</span> <span id="s840">In this case that he would get something in his own industry was fantastic.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">FW: The reason I asked it was that your mother had been used to maids, a governess.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">GR: No problems.</span> <span id="s843">My parents were both very intelligent people.</span> <span id="s844">There was no problem absolutely.</span> <span id="s845">I don’t think in all these early years here in America did I ever hear anything, what happened to us.</span> <span id="s846">We had only to look forward, we didn’t look back.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">FW: Good point.</span> <span id="s848">Did you mentioned that you rented a room.</span> <span id="s849">Was this in an apartment with other German Jewish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s850">GR: No.</span> <span id="s851">No.</span> <span id="s852">That was in a boarding house run by German Christians who were very nice and very pleasant.</span> <span id="s853">Really tried to help us.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">FW: That must have been an interesting experience in terms of their, they were German Christians.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">GR: They were German Christians, but they were here for so long.</span> <span id="s856">It was a help that they spoke German, and they gave the appearance of being so anti-Nazi which I’m sure they were that there was no, you see we also had the experience, my father had the business experience of Germans who were not Nazis and his secretary in several instances other than the one I mentioned before proved her loyalty that we knew that not all Germans are rotten.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">FW: Did you go back to school at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s858">GR: Well then we come, as soon as my father saw that he was going from his nineteen dollars a week a little bit up he wanted me to continue with my education, and then is when I wrote to the professor in Minneapolis, the University of Minnesota wherever that is.</span> <span id="s859">And then he answered, in all fairness to you I think knowing your circumstances, since you cannot materially afford it I would have to advise you think of something else and don’t pursue it.</span> <span id="s860">It is a fantastic field and all that.</span> <span id="s861">So what am I going to do?</span> <span id="s862">I always said I can’t think of myself being a secretary sitting down writing a letter please us a dozen tubes of toothpaste, that’s been my, little did I know that in later years I would marry a man who was in the dental supply business.</span> <span id="s863">So we figured out what should I do, but we knew that I could not afford to go to college or to even get the high school equivalency credits and all that.</span> <span id="s864">I had to work and all that.</span> <span id="s865">So I went to business school, but took up legal, law stenography and became a law stenographer and worked in law offices.</span> <span id="s866">One of my bosses even sent me on a non-matriculating basis to law school.</span> <span id="s867">So I took law classes at NYU while I was working in his office.</span> <span id="s868">He paid for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">FW: So when you took the law stenography?</span></p> <p><span id="s870">GR: My father was able to pay for it.</span> <span id="s871">By then my father was able to pay for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">FW: When you, I mean you were 18 years old when you first came here.</span> <span id="s873">Did you begin to establish a social life?</span></p> <p><span id="s874">GR: With the children, I mean my friends from Germany and their group.</span> <span id="s875">There was a whole group.</span> <span id="s876">A whole gang.</span> <span id="s877">In Kew Gardens and spread over Manhattan.</span> <span id="s878">One of my neighbors, another neighbor the boys lived up here uptown Manhattan, and we would meet and would do things together.</span> <span id="s879">Would go to museums together, all the things that cost nothing together.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">FW: How, did you join any organizations or .</span> <span id="s881">.</span> <span id="s882">?</span></p> <p><span id="s883">GR: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">FW: I do have to go back for just a minute.</span> <span id="s885">When you were in this legal stenography school or classes did you find any difficulties, you were pretty well versed in terms of the language?</span></p> <p><span id="s886">GR: None whatsoever because when I came to this country except for my tremendous Scottish brogue I spoke a much better English than I did today because in the last few years, particularly since the incidence with my husband I’ve been speaking, and since our daughter has left the house I’m speaking much more German again.</span> <span id="s887">I never had to grope for any English word I find myself doing these days and even not so very long ago discussed with my husband that fact which bothers me greatly today.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">FW: My parents do that too, because they never did before, but that’s interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">GR: I mean I spoke English with my daughter till she was three years old when she was three years old I switched to German in the house.</span> <span id="s890">I promised never to speak German to her when we are outside the house or a third person present.</span> <span id="s891">A non-German speaking present.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">FW: Why did you make that promise?</span></p> <p><span id="s893">GR: She wouldn’t want me to speak German in front of her friends or anybody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">FW: Did she voice that, did she say that?</span></p> <p><span id="s895">GR: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s896">But she also realized that she had an opportunity to l earn a foreign language without any problem, and so we arranged it this way.</span> <span id="s897">She realized that at a very, very early age.</span> <span id="s898">And now she is very grateful for it.</span> <span id="s899">By the time she went to college she was exceedingly grateful for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">FW: When did you, in looking back, what do you think was the greatest adjustment that you had to make here?</span></p> <p><span id="s901">GR: The most difficult time was being an adult living at home with my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">FW: In what way do you mean that?</span></p> <p><span id="s903">GR: Well I was twenty-six years old before I got married and the last few years were quite difficult because I had a rather authoritarian father who felt I was his child, and I had no right to my own opinions.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">FW: And of course then there was no question of moving out on your own.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">GR: I had no, first of all it was unheard of and anyway I was in no financial position to do that.</span> <span id="s906">I had a very, very good job.</span> <span id="s907">I don’t even want to say I was in no financial position.</span> <span id="s908">That may be even wrong, but I think it did not even occur to me it wasn’t done and also I was saving every penny that I earned.</span> <span id="s909">And that was instilled in me and I think my experiences make me do that.</span> <span id="s910">The thought of moving out did not occur.</span> <span id="s911">I knew I had to live with this.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">FW: When you say that you were saving every penny, do you think you were part of a rebuilding?</span></p> <p><span id="s913">GR: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">FW: In terms of your own family?</span></p> <p><span id="s915">GR: No.</span> <span id="s916">Why should I be part...</span></p> <p><span id="s917">FW: In terms of rebuilding your family’s life, in terms of...</span></p> <p><span id="s918">GR: No.</span> <span id="s919">I didn’t think in that frame.</span> <span id="s920">I didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">FW: I mean that you were all struggling toward one end.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">GR: I mean my father, after awhile he came into the position where he didn’t need any support from me.</span> <span id="s923">That I was not even contributing.</span> <span id="s924">I mean he wouldn’t let me know these things.</span> <span id="s925">Everything that I gave went into my account.</span> <span id="s926">At a much later date did I find out that it was all there.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">FW: Did he insist that your mother stop working?</span></p> <p><span id="s928">GR: Yes.</span> <span id="s929">At the first moment that that was possible.</span> <span id="s930">I mean that was the first thing there was.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">FW: How did your mother feel about having to stop working?</span></p> <p><span id="s932">GR: I have no idea.</span> <span id="s933">I can’t tell you, because then came a period, well then we had the war where working was self understood and all.</span> <span id="s934">I don’t know when my mother stopped working and, what was I going to say, there came a period, but that was later only after I was married I believe, that m y father and mother spent half a year in Kentucky.</span> <span id="s935">My father’s firm built a factory in Kentucky and he was there part of the year.</span> <span id="s936">Before I was married I was alone, my mother stayed with me, but after that she moved with him to Kentucky and they spent a half a year in Kentucky and a half a year in New York, but this is not...</span></p> <p><span id="s937">FW: Today, in your life today do you think of yourself more in the American mainstream or more of the German Jewish refugee community?</span></p> <p><span id="s938">GR: I don’t feel myself part of the American, I feel myself more of the American mainstream than part of the German Jewish community, but only in the sense of community.</span> <span id="s939">I feel myself much more part of being a German Jew if you ask me that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">FW: That’s basically what, well in what sense...</span></p> <p><span id="s941">GR: I want you to know I’m a notorious non-joiner partly due to my legal training and partly due to Joe McCarthy.</span> <span id="s942">That was the most frightening period because even though, I mean McCarthy was Communist hunting, whether you had Communist or Nazi, right or left whatever not you are doing, I approve as little of Communism as I approve of the Nazis, but I saw the same pictures.</span> <span id="s943">And that was the most frightening period and when he had some people on the stands that were fourteen years old when they were part of a group.</span> <span id="s944">He never gave them a chance to say I was fourteen years old.</span> <span id="s945">The cross examination, I mean I know from my law experience how cross examinations went.</span> <span id="s946">You cannot say, but I was only fourteen.</span> <span id="s947">Only yes and no.</span> <span id="s948">That made me so convinced, I don’t sign a petition that comes around, for nobody, for nothing, for no candidate even though I may be 100 percent for it.</span> <span id="s949">I will tell you that some members of the temple have approached me many a time.</span> <span id="s950">I have said I will do anything that you want me to do for sisterhood.</span> <span id="s951">They never approached me anymore and I said why?</span> <span id="s952">Well you are not a member of the sisterhood.</span> <span id="s953">You cannot make me join the sisterhood.</span> <span id="s954">I will not even join the sisterhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">FW: But you mentioned that as being a non-joiner in terms of your friends today are most of them from the European refugee.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">GR: Absolutely, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">FW: By choice?</span></p> <p><span id="s958">GR: By choice and the fact that though we have met many Americans there has never been a rapport, and we do not care too much for acquaintances, wasting our time with acquaintances.</span> <span id="s959">We prefer to stay with friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">FW: Why do you think the rapport was never there?</span></p> <p><span id="s961">GR: Because most of these people, and there are some exceptions, have different values than we do.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">FW: What do you mean by different values?</span></p> <p><span id="s963">GR: What is of greater importance to them in life, which things are of greater importance to them, I mean than to, there’s a difference.</span> <span id="s964">They’d rather drive cadillacs and spend their money on cadillacs.</span> <span id="s965">I prefer to drive an oldsmobile and put the difference into my bank account.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">FW: Okay.</span> <span id="s967">Do you feel that your own background, your own experiences over all that time has led you to more friends with people of your own background.</span> <span id="s968">You understand each other better?</span></p> <p><span id="s969">GR: Probably.</span> <span id="s970">Now my husband had a very wide range of possibilities through business to make friends, but he had the same experience.</span> <span id="s971">Very, very few you would warm up to, because most of the time we say they live in a different world than we do.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">FW: Do you think that while your daughter was growing up, did you think of yourself las a different parent, or do you think you were a different parent?</span></p> <p><span id="s973">GR: We were different parents necessitated by two factors.</span> <span id="s974">One factor was that we were much older parents than most of her classmates parents were.</span> <span id="s975">Number two also, my upbringing, my very strict upbringing which I had sworn I would not do to my daughter, in a certain way translated itself into certain actions.</span> <span id="s976">And I heard for many, many years from my daughter what you did to me while I was in school, because I studied with her, and I made her work.</span> <span id="s977">Only very recently did she tell me an episode which really thrilled me.</span> <span id="s978">She had classes in the Getty Museum this year in California, and with the professors and the curator, our daughter is an archeologist, but went into archeology as a historian and not as an art historian or a classicist.</span> <span id="s979">And they were having a discussion, in fact when we were out there just now she showed me the object under discussion, and asked me to identify them, and she made an identification of two objects, one of which was the real thing, the other one was an imitation.</span> <span id="s980">And out of the class she was the only one who could do it, and the professor said I’m just plainly amazed, you are the only one in this class who is not an art historian.</span> <span id="s981">How can you do it?</span> <span id="s982">And she told the professor, the professor even said the way you do these things is better than I’ve ever seen it done, and even I cannot do it as well.</span> <span id="s983">And she said there is one difference as you didn’t have my mother as a mother, because I took my daughter to the museums several times a month when she was small, and I always had a girlfriend along and we played games.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">FW: Just like the geography and the history games.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">GR: Right.</span> <span id="s986">That’s exactly it.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">FW: In terms of your own life do you feel that you had opportunity here?</span></p> <p><span id="s988">GR: I’m perfectly satisfied.</span> <span id="s989">I’m exceedingly satisfied with my life.</span> <span id="s990">I will tell you.</span> <span id="s991">I had a fantastic job in one of the then largest law firms in New York.</span> <span id="s992">I had a great deal of satisfaction in my job.</span> <span id="s993">It also was a very nerve-wracking job.</span> <span id="s994">My husband claims that that killed my nerves.</span> <span id="s995">I believe it was Hitler who killed my nerves.</span> <span id="s996">I’m very high-strung these days.</span> <span id="s997">I mean I’ve always been,.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">FW: Speaking of when you say Hitler and nerves did you ever return to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s999">GR: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s1000">I mean I mentioned, if ever I’m in Europe I go to Nuremberg to visit our friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">FW: You mentioned that the first time was 1962.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">GR: My attitude has totally changed.</span> <span id="s1003">First of all you do not feel the goose-steps anymore.</span> <span id="s1004">The boots are long gone.</span> <span id="s1005">The border patrol does not wear those boots anymore.</span> <span id="s1006">In the first few times I felt everybody is looking at me and everybody thinks,and with our name what it is we are always identified as Jews, if my mother goes she is not identified as a Jew, which is a vast difference.</span> <span id="s1007">I’ve always felt very strongly, I still feel very strongly, on that, though I have gone to Germany quite frequently and no longer at all feel that way.</span> <span id="s1008">I have overcome that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">FW: How do you feel, have you ever gone back to Nuremberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">GR: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">FW: Have you ever gone back to your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">GR: I have looked at it several times.</span> <span id="s1013">It doesn’t bother me in the slightest.</span> <span id="s1014">It is somebody else’s house.</span> <span id="s1015">It doesn’t mean a thing to me.</span> <span id="s1016">I’ve shown it to my husband, I’ve shown it to my daughter.</span> <span id="s1017">And that’s about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">FW: Have you ever in being there made contact with Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">GR: There’s only once with my father’s secretary and her son and daughter-in-law, nobody else.</span> <span id="s1020">I had no intention, as a matter of fact one of my former classmates asked me why don’t I contact some of our classmates.</span> <span id="s1021">There was one girl whom I would have contacted.</span> <span id="s1022">She was the daughter of a high army officer, for a very short time went to school with us, and she, though she quite openly told us that she had gotten into trouble because she was seen with me, she didn’t care a damn, nor did her father who was an army officer.</span> <span id="s1023">But what happened to her or that family, I have no knowledge.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">FW: Any of these people who were classmates or anything like that have you ever accidentally.</span> <span id="s1025">.</span> <span id="s1026">?</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">GR: No.</span> <span id="s1028">The only one I have come across is a girl who was half Jewish who emigrated and she lives in England.</span> <span id="s1029">And she came over here one day and another classmate of mine and here in my house in the discussion with us said the hardest thing was that she was half Jewish.</span> <span id="s1030">She was a non-person to everybody.</span> <span id="s1031">She sat next to me in class and she said I always had a feeling that you didn’t trust me.</span> <span id="s1032">I could take something or you could say something or do something to the other, for the others I was a Jew.</span> <span id="s1033">This is what I told my daughter for all these years.</span> <span id="s1034">I’m very, very liberal minded and as far as religion is concerned it wouldn’t bother me the slightest if you were to marry a non-Jew because of my experience with my Scottish family, and I only call them my family, however my experience with the Nazis would tell me marry a Jew only.</span> <span id="s1035">I think we can top if off here by saying...she is marrying a Jew.</span> <span id="s1036">(Just won a Fulbright to U. of Rome.)</span></p></body></html>
