<span id="s13">And if you could go into a little bit about the home life and your upbringing.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Leonard Zawacki: Well I, I was born in northwestern part of Poland.</span> <span id="s15">In the town of Grudziadz which before the First World War was under the German occupation or it was part of Germany.</span> <span id="s16">And I went to school, to high school.</span> <span id="s17">I finished the high school and then I started my studies in Warsaw in economics.</span> <span id="s18">Where it was called Central School of Commerce.</span> <span id="s19">In Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">The war of course interrupted my studies.</span> <span id="s21">And in 1938 I was conscripted.</span> <span id="s22">I had to serve in the, in the armed forces and I was since I was a student I was taken to the cadet officers school, reserved cadet officers school.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: May I ask how many people in your family, your brothers and sisters.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: Well I only have a sister, my father and mother.</span> <span id="s25">We had a house in Grudziadz really.</span> <span id="s26">I could say that we were quite comfortable and my sister was married.</span> <span id="s27">She married a judge who I think district judge or whatever they would call it.</span> <span id="s28">In my home down.</span> <span id="s29">And he was also called up.</span> <span id="s30">He was a reserve officer and when the war broke out he was called up and he was taken prisoner of war and he spent the war years in a prisoner of war camp.</span> <span id="s31">In Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: What did your father do?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: My father an engineer, a railroad engineer.</span> <span id="s34">And as I said, the I had quite a good life, really.</span> <span id="s35">You know with many friends and was enjoyed, was enjoying my life.</span> <span id="s36">And</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: Did you have, was there very much religious upbringing in</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: I, well I was brought up as a Catholic but although my mother was probably quite religious.</span> <span id="s39">There never was any pressure on me to, to if there was any pressure was exerted it was rather by the school than by my parents.</span> <span id="s40">But I, I am not a very religious person.</span> <span id="s41">And well that’s about all about my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Of course the war interrupted everything.</span> <span id="s43">And as I said I was, I was serving in the cadet officers school.</span> <span id="s44">When the war broke out and I went to war.</span> <span id="s45">Although I was supposed to be released from the school because the school only took one year.</span> <span id="s46">And I was supposed to be released in October, but the war broke out on the first of September 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">And I took part in the defense of Warsaw and was taken prisoner of war.</span> <span id="s48">And in Warsaw on the 27th, 28th actually of September.</span> <span id="s49">And from there, from the transport to the prisoner of war camp, I did escape and I came to my home town.</span> <span id="s50">And to see my parents.</span> <span id="s51">And there I came sometimes in October of 39.</span> <span id="s52">And then at the end of October, I was arrested by the local German units of serve protection units.</span> <span id="s53">They called themselves Zedshuts and these were Germans, because my home town had a minority German minority of approximately 10%.</span> <span id="s54">They’re in a minority and once the Germans invaded, right away they were very well organized and they formed self-protected units and two fellows arrested me and I was taken as a hostage.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">And I spent the next few weeks as a hostage and later was released under the condition that I leave this territory.</span> <span id="s56">You know that I was undesirable person.</span> <span id="s57">Because these territories where incorporated into Germany.</span> <span id="s58">And I was evicted to the central part of Poland which was German occupied but not incorporated into Germany.</span> <span id="s59">And I went to Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: Let’s fast forward.</span> <span id="s61">They wanted to know a little bit about your family life but also what happened after you escaped from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s62">So if we could fast forward to that time and I just, I’m interested in what, after you escaped, what was your life like then?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: After I escaped, well once we escaped we did have, we were in touch with the Underground which was in the vicinity of Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s64">And we were taken over by Underground people and directed from there, to the partisan units which were in southern Poland.</span> <span id="s65">In the mountains.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: Where is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: Oh it, the towns which the bigger towns were Kenti and then (pause) the mountains were the range was the Carpathian range but this particular part was called Beshid Zahodni, the western Beshid and one of the bigger, biggest mountains there was Bialia Gora and the other town I just can’t think of it at the moment, the name.</span> <span id="s68">And it starts with Z.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">I will remember.</span> <span id="s70">It will come back to me.</span> <span id="s71">Oh yes, Zeviets.</span> <span id="s72">It was Zeviets, near Zeviets.</span> <span id="s73">And there were approximately 100 partisans, of which approximately 20, 20 were escapees from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s74">And we also had approximately ten Russians and the Russians were, who either parachutists who were dropped.</span> <span id="s75">There were 3 of them.</span> <span id="s76">Then there were some pilots who were shot down over Germany.</span> <span id="s77">And they escaped and came, joined us.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">And then there some escapees from prisoner of war camps.</span> <span id="s79">Altogether we had ten.</span> <span id="s80">But our unit, the partisan unit was sponsored by the Polish legitimate government which was at that time in London.</span> <span id="s81">You know after, after the fall of Poland some of the governmental offices all moved, first to France.</span> <span id="s82">And after the fall of France, they went to England.</span> <span id="s83">And England was a legitimate Polish government which was the continuation of the government, of the prewar government.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">And we were sponsored by them and by the English of course.</span> <span id="s85">And there were drops made in Poland you know of ammunition and other materials.</span> <span id="s86">And so we were supported by them.</span> <span id="s87">Of course, when the Russian front moved and to Poland, the Russians also established their own government you know Polish government.</span> <span id="s88">And they also had their own partisan units.</span> <span id="s89">And since we were sponsored by the government in, in England, in London, we were again when the Russians came, we were the enemies of the, of the Russians because we were not communist sponsored.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">And before when the, the we when the, the front came quite near and we knew that any time they Russians would be there, we separate the Russian prisoners who were with us, the partisans.</span> <span id="s91">We told them that they are on their own now.</span> <span id="s92">And, and after that we dispersed ourselves because we knew that if the Russians came they would deport us to, to Siberia.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: I’m very curious about what your activities were like before that happened, what your life was like, the daily kind of.</span> <span id="s94">You were living in the mountains.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: Well the, the really lived mostly and we moved only by night.</span> <span id="s96">And day time we did sleep and we slept in the open.</span> <span id="s97">Many times we slept on the bare ground and when we woke up in the evening you know we were covered with snow.</span> <span id="s98">And it was very tough.</span> <span id="s99">It was not an easy life at all.</span> <span id="s100">Later on when in January, end of December and January when it became very cold, we took over how do you say, a hunting lodge which was deep in the mountains.</span> <span id="s101">And we did make a tunnel from there because it was close to a stream.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">From the stream we made a tunnel to get into the hunting lodge.</span> <span id="s103">So that nobody could see whether there was any movement, the movement went through the tunnel and we stayed in this, in this hunting lodge.</span> <span id="s104">And our activities were we were, you have to remember that this part of, where we were and also Auschwitz itself was incorporated into Germany.</span> <span id="s105">It was German territory.</span> <span id="s106">They claimed it as German.</span> <span id="s107">And many of the inhabitants, Polish inhabitants were evicted.</span> <span id="s108">And many of the farms and so on and big estates where the Polish owners were evicted and Germans were brought in from deferment parts of Romania and Latvia, Lithuania because the Germans were straight and even Russia there were German people living in Russia, in the Volga region.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">And they were brought in there.</span> <span id="s110">So our movements we had difficulty in movement.</span> <span id="s111">But we did also undertake some where we intercepted some prisoners and we, I know of, of only one instance where we intercepted two Polish prisoners while they were taken from one place or from one camp taking to the main camp.</span> <span id="s112">They were intercepted by us and taken.</span> <span id="s113">And they were freed.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Well how it was done that they were convoyed by guards, by two guards, two prisoners and from the sub camp to the main camp on the way they were approached.</span> <span id="s115">We had uniforms.</span> <span id="s116">We also had SS uniforms and we approached them and we told them.</span> <span id="s117">that we were representatives of the camp Gestapo, or the political department and that these two prisoners are needed for interrogation.</span> <span id="s118">And we signed the papers an gave to the guards and they released them and we took them over.</span> <span id="s119">And they came and joined the partisans.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">It so happened that they didn’t, one of them anyway didn’t survive.</span> <span id="s121">He was later on killed in an action.</span> <span id="s122">Where matter of fact I had another friend of mine came the night before to this safe house.</span> <span id="s123">And we left next night and in the morning this house was surrounded and one of the, the one prisoner who was released by us was the, there were actually four of them and they were all killed with the exception of one.</span> <span id="s124">Who hid in the basement of the, of the house and while the Germans tried to flush them out they were throwing grenades into the basement, he always picked up the grenade before it exploded and threw it in the next part of the basement.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">And then he buried himself in one corner of the, of the basement there was you know potatoes, when they grow and I don’t’ know to do, how do you describe them.</span> <span id="s126">Potato and they have light you know they start growing.</span> <span id="s127">And people in order to prevent it you know they take it, take these parts off.</span> <span id="s128">They grow and he buried himself in there.</span> <span id="s129">So when the SS came they knew that there were four prisoners or partisans and they only could account for 3.</span> <span id="s130">And finally one of the SS people had an idea that to look there whether somebody is buried under this, I don’t’ know how to call this, this outgrowth of the potatoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">And they discovered him so they took him.</span> <span id="s132">They bound his hands behind him.</span> <span id="s133">With a belt.</span> <span id="s134">And put him on a truck and were driving him to the camp.</span> <span id="s135">Somehow when he was sitting there in the truck he loosened his hands and jumped out of the truck you know and while he jumped out on the road, he hit his and broke his collar bone and smashed his face.</span> <span id="s136">But picked himself up and he run on the road.</span> <span id="s137">Before they stopped the truck, he got away.</span> <span id="s138">And he survived.</span> <span id="s139">Matter of fact he lived in Canada in Edmonton.</span> <span id="s140">And last year he died.</span> <span id="s141">He had a heart condition.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">So he was very lucky, he was very lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: These were typical of your experiences then right before the –</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: Now we did what did we, you see we, we caught, we couldn’t and we didn’t’ want to kill you know unnecessarily.</span> <span id="s145">We had opportunities to you know kill the Germans but the repercussions would be so, so great that it you know that only the unarmed civilian population would be suffering.</span> <span id="s146">We didn’t want that.</span> <span id="s147">But what we did since some of the big farms were taken over by the Germans who were brought out from different parts of Europe, we did tell them that they will have to move out.</span> <span id="s148">We were harassing them.</span> <span id="s149">And we were also blowing up you know bridges and railway jun, there was railway junctions.</span> <span id="s150">That’s what we, but we were not intent to killing individuals because we knew that there would be great repercussions you know to the Polish c, civilian population.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">So we, we tried to avoid that.</span> <span id="s152">But of course I was only 4 months in the partisans since my escape.</span> <span id="s153">And we also of course we had to feed ourselves.</span> <span id="s154">What we you know we, we raided some of the German stores you know for the food which we needed.</span> <span id="s155">We also took cattle from the German farms and so on because we needed to feed ourselves.</span> <span id="s156">But the life in the partisans was very, very hard.</span> <span id="s157">Very, very tough indeed.</span> <span id="s158">And many times we also went hungry.</span> <span id="s159">If we had to if we couldn’t get any food from the Germans, you know of course we did buy food from the Polish peasants but we paid for it cause we had funds for this.</span> <span id="s160">And we didn’t want to anybody to suffer.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Now there were, we did have well I can tell you one instance where we did matter of fact, I and three other.</span> <span id="s162">I was in charge of this action.</span> <span id="s163">We went, we were always very close to the Auschwitz concentration camp.</span> <span id="s164">Quite close.</span> <span id="s165">We you know we and one day actually one night we went and we, we had to do something and then on the way back we were rather tired.</span> <span id="s166">It was late at night and I said let’s knock on the windows of a hut and let’s hope that these are Polish peasants.</span> <span id="s167">As it happened, he was a Polish peasant and did knock on the windows and he came and we told him who we are and whether he could give us a lift.</span> <span id="s168">Through the mountains.</span> <span id="s169">It was quite a distance to walk.</span> <span id="s170">And he said oh yes.</span> <span id="s171">He will and he right away he got dressed and he went to the stables and he you know harnessed a horse and to the sled and we got into the sled.</span> <span id="s172">And we told him to avoid the main roads, to go you know through the villages and so on but avoid the, the main roads because on the main roads there were German transports going and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">We didn’t want to have any encounter with them.</span> <span id="s174">So as we came to one village and it was of course snow covered, the terrain and it was rather dark night.</span> <span id="s175">But still the reflection from the snow you know it was making it.</span> <span id="s176">Anyway we came to the middle of the village.</span> <span id="s177">As we were in the middle of the village, we looked to the sides and there were tanks parked in the, in the yards of the, of the peasant huts.</span> <span id="s178">And it was an SS unit and we didn’t of course.</span> <span id="s179">I had to make the decision and I said well since we are more than half way through the village we just carry on.</span> <span id="s180">And we did carry on.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Then the village road left to the main road which we had to take.</span> <span id="s182">As we came to the main road a truck, a German truck came out and the road was very narrow and the truck stopped and a sergeant, SS sergeant got out and apparently he had the intention of arresting us and that we are trying to interfere with his war.</span> <span id="s183">And but when he saw us four there in the sled, it was the driver, there were five, he didn’t’ utter a word.</span> <span id="s184">He, he realized that we were probably he realized that we were partisans.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Because on the main roads the Germans had big boards, billboards.</span> <span id="s186">The written and warning that the German troops of bandits, they called us bandits.</span> <span id="s187">Bandits you know so I’m sure he realized that we were one but he didn’t say.</span> <span id="s188">Anyway had he uttered something you know we would have to shoot him because, but so we went, we came to the main road.</span> <span id="s189">The main road was at that time free and then we went a little bit further to the foothills and we dismissed the, the driver.</span> <span id="s190">And we thanked him very much and we then walked there and we went back into the mountains.</span> <span id="s191">We had some safe houses in the mountains .</span> <span id="s192">it was there were foresters who were at the, we stayed with them.</span> <span id="s193">Matter of fact this particular time it was actually the Christmas Eve And then we went to the, to the forest and there we had we came after midnight and we had our Christmas Eve celebration.</span> <span id="s194">Very short one.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: What was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: Oh we, we just went to the house, we woke up the whole household.</span> <span id="s197">That was only the forester, his wife and two daughters.</span> <span id="s198">And we just went there and we sung carols and then we went to sleep cause we were tired.</span> <span id="s199">It was already past midnight we went to sleep into, in the barn.</span> <span id="s200">We didn’t’ sleep in the house.</span> <span id="s201">And then the next morning we stayed again through the whole day in the barn until evening.</span> <span id="s202">Then we went back to our camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Well we went to our camp and you know joined our other comrades.</span> <span id="s204">And at one time you know the, the Russian, it was then the you, no it wasn’t Christmas Eve.</span> <span id="s205">Then we stayed there until the first of January.</span> <span id="s206">We spent celebrated as much as we could celebrate, New Year’s eve in the mountains.</span> <span id="s207">And the Russians were already nearing the camp at Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: What was that time like, Did you, was there an actual time when you knew you were being liberated.</span> <span id="s209">Or</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: Well we, we knew you know the front movements.</span> <span id="s211">Matter of fact, you know for instance, one instance we were in the mountains.</span> <span id="s212">Again in the night.</span> <span id="s213">a whole company of maybe a few, maybe a battalion of Germans was marching on the road in the mountains.</span> <span id="s214">And we came to the road.</span> <span id="s215">We didn’t take the main roads.</span> <span id="s216">We always went, and we had very good guides who knew the mountains you know inside and out.</span> <span id="s217">You know they were mountain people so we didn’t have to them anyway.</span> <span id="s218">But we came once to a main road and on this main road therefore was a whole battalion of Germans marching in the night.</span> <span id="s219">And they were withdrawing from the eastern front.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">And we came right to, to the edge of you know on the, of the road and we walked alongside the Germans.</span> <span id="s221">They didn’t bother us and we didn’t bother.</span> <span id="s222">They spoke to us and we spoke to them.</span> <span id="s223">And then when there was a gap between the battalions we crossed the road because we had to go.</span> <span id="s224">Of course we wouldn’t take on a whole you know battalion of German solders because we didn’t have any chance.</span> <span id="s225">And they didn’t want any bother either.</span> <span id="s226">So you know it mutually understandable that they knew that there were partisans and knew that they were, but we didn’t interfere with their actions and they didn’t interfere with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">And in, in January of 45 when, when I don’t’ know the exact date but probably in the middle, in the middle of January because Auschwitz was liberated a, I think at the end of January on the I think 28th of January.</span> <span id="s228">But it was evacuated on the 18th January.</span> <span id="s229">The able bodied prisoners in Auschwitz were evacuated to deep into the German Reich and they were marched.</span> <span id="s230">So in the, in the middle of January when we knew that the front and the Russians are coming close, we an order came from the main headquarters of the partisan unit.</span> <span id="s231">Actually the partisan units were called the home army.</span> <span id="s232">In, and it was a very well organized organization and was well I mean Poland wide you know not only in the mountains where we were but there were also in the east of Poland you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">And what awe heard when they came and they disclosed themselves to the Russians many of them or most of them were arrested and taken to Siberia.</span> <span id="s234">And since we knew about it, we said we are not going to the headquarters knew about it, they disbanded.</span> <span id="s235">They gave us orders to be that we will be disbanding and go as civilians and they issued us false papers as civilians.</span> <span id="s236">In the neighborhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">So we went after the Russians moved there we went as civilians and we went back to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s238">In Auschwitz I had other friends of mine who came escaped from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s239">We registered ourselves in Auschwitz as former prisoners of Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s240">And we got legitimate papers from there.</span> <span id="s241">Of course the transport was very, very poor and we couldn’t’ move very easily but eventually we were able to, to get to Krakow from Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">And in Krakow we had some friends, especially one friend who was still alive.</span> <span id="s243">He was also a former inmate in Auschwitz and we stayed with him.</span> <span id="s244">And later on when the movement, you know at that time there was, the whole front was moving west.</span> <span id="s245">And we encountered many, many Russians and especially the Russians who near, when we stayed near Auschwitz they were always asking us how far is it to the former Polish German border.</span> <span id="s246">And we said it was approximately it was ten kilometers and we said we were curious.</span> <span id="s247">Why did they ask.</span> <span id="s248">I said why do you ask.</span> <span id="s249">He said because once we cross this border then we can do whatever we like.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: Was it a time of chaos?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: Yes, there was a chaos yes.</span> <span id="s252">First of all the railroads were disrupted.</span> <span id="s253">You know the lines were disrupted.</span> <span id="s254">You know there were bombings and, and you couldn’t’ go, you only could go so far and then the, the line was the railroad line was damaged and you had to walk for a few kilometers and then take another train from there on.</span> <span id="s255">and so on.</span> <span id="s256">So there was a lot of disruption, especially going from south to north.</span> <span id="s257">The lines you know going from east to west they were kept because that’s where you know the movement was and all the delivery of the arms and so on had to go this way so they were repaired right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">But the other lines you know meaning from north, from south to north, they were disrupted yeah.</span> <span id="s259">They were not, so it, it was very difficult to move around.</span> <span id="s260">It wasn’t easy at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: You’re talking about phone lines?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: Oh not only phone but rail lines you know and roads.</span> <span id="s263">And roads.</span> <span id="s264">Especially rail.</span> <span id="s265">For instance I after I stayed in Krakow for some time I think in end of February, I think we, my friend who also lived in, in northern part of Poland, not far from home town, we wanted to go and we went.</span> <span id="s266">And for instance we had to travel mostly on top of the roof of the, of the trains.</span> <span id="s267">Then we only could get, we couldn’t go through Warsaw.</span> <span id="s268">We had to take some line.</span> <span id="s269">Then and we had to walk, to walk many times you know for, for many hundred, not hundred but tens of kilometers.</span> <span id="s270">And finally we did get to, to nearby west of Warsaw and there we got a train, a Russian transport train which was delivering petrol or what you say, gasoline.</span> <span id="s271">You know to the front cause the war was still on.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">So we got on this tank, tanker and I, I had an accident.</span> <span id="s273">I put my foot in order you know to sit under the big tank you know and just on some railing you know.</span> <span id="s274">I tried to prop myself up and I put my foot in a coupling you know where the trains when they, the coupling.</span> <span id="s275">There was an opening.</span> <span id="s276">I put my, my heel into it.</span> <span id="s277">I wore, I had a German jackboot you know which I took from a German.</span> <span id="s278">And it had a very strong heel.</span> <span id="s279">Anyway I put it in there.</span> <span id="s280">And while the train was pulling you know there was a gap and I didn’t’ realize that after it started braking it stand you know and the opening closed and it caught my heel.</span> <span id="s281">And matter of fact, I thought that I lost my you know my, my heel.</span> <span id="s282">That it was crushed.</span> <span id="s283">Because right away you see the, the boot.</span> <span id="s284">Broke, the leather broke.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">And I felt tremendous heat you know in the whole foot.</span> <span id="s286">But I couldn’t’ pull out, I couldn’t’ do anything until the train started to pull again and then I was able to feel my foot.</span> <span id="s287">And, but and I asked my friend because my friend was sitting next to me, to hold me in case I lost consciousness.</span> <span id="s288">You know so that I wouldn’t’ fall under the wheels.</span> <span id="s289">And, and then finally the, the train came to a stop at a station and we got off and I went to a first aid station but they didn’t’ have much there.</span> <span id="s290">in the first aid station.</span> <span id="s291">They couldn’t’ do it.</span> <span id="s292">all they did, they split the jack boot and I took it off and there was, there was no, it was only internal bleeding and the whole foot was black and blue.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">And they, they couldn’t x ray because they didn’t have any x ray machines.</span> <span id="s294">And we couldn’t also we had to walk for an hour I think, some 30 or 40 kilometers to the next, and I was hobbling on this foot and eventually there was a cart, a peasant’s cart and I, they put me on the peasant’s cart and that, til we came to his home town which was is approximately 40 miles away from my home town.</span> <span id="s295">And I stayed there for the next two weeks I think, three weeks.</span> <span id="s296">And then later on, I, I took from there and I took a train to, to my home town which I thought I would be able to get.</span> <span id="s297">But it only went one station and they stopped.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">The Russians stopped the train and they put it on the side, side rank.</span> <span id="s299">And then they took all the people in the train to do, do some work for the you know for the Russians.</span> <span id="s300">I, I refused.</span> <span id="s301">I said I can’t work because I, I was lame.</span> <span id="s302">I just couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s303">So I had an argument with a Russian sergeant, but anyway he walked away.</span> <span id="s304">And, and then he said well you work for one day and then the next day you will go carry on.</span> <span id="s305">Well the next day came.</span> <span id="s306">The train was still on the sides.</span> <span id="s307">You know the people were still working.</span> <span id="s308">The next, there was only one train a day coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">But I knew about it.</span> <span id="s310">you know I knew how the Russians behaved so I went back and when the train came I got on this train and I went, but again it only went few, a few stations and then I had to get off and walk.</span> <span id="s311">And by that time I could walk much better.</span> <span id="s312">And then I while I walked, a Russian truck came and I stopped and they, they gave me a lift.</span> <span id="s313">And then finally I came to the place which was quite close to my hometown.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">But it was on the left bank of the Vistula river and I had to walk, I walked to the Vistula but the bridges on my, there were two bridges leading across the Vistula and they were both blown up.</span> <span id="s315">So and the river was full of ice.</span> <span id="s316">It was still I think March.</span> <span id="s317">Full of ice.</span> <span id="s318">So I couldn’t get through and it was, the level of the water was very high.</span> <span id="s319">There were docks you know.</span> <span id="s320">It was close to the you know you thought that any, any moment it will overflow.</span> <span id="s321">You know and flood all the low lying lands.</span> <span id="s322">But after a few days you know it, water receded and the ice receded and then the Russian start to build a pontoon bridge.</span> <span id="s323">So once they started building the pontoon bridge, I, I stayed in a, a farm house which was a German farm house which was abandoned by the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">And there were, but there were still you know the livestock was there and we went into this house.</span> <span id="s325">There was nobody but we went in the room and there was heat so we wondered what, what happening.</span> <span id="s326">Couldn’t see.</span> <span id="s327">After a while a man came and he was a groom who was a Polish fellow, a groom to the livestock who were German farmer.</span> <span id="s328">And we said well then we can stay.</span> <span id="s329">He said oh yes you can stay here.</span> <span id="s330">He said do you need any food.</span> <span id="s331">I said of course we need food.</span> <span id="s332">So he brought us food and milk.</span> <span id="s333">And so we stayed there for a few days until the water had receded.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Once the water receded we went to the, to the place where the Russians were building the pontoon bridge.</span> <span id="s335">As we came there, the Russianist arrested us and took us, they said, not arrested but they wanted us to work so they loaded us on a truck and they were driving somewhere and said where are you driving.</span> <span id="s336">Finally you know because the truck stopped and the officer got out and he looked at the map and he didn’t know where he was.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">And then we asked him what do you want.</span> <span id="s338">He said I want the forest.</span> <span id="s339">I said why.</span> <span id="s340">Because we need some wood to cut wood.</span> <span id="s341">I said why didn’t you ask us.</span> <span id="s342">We would, you’re going out of your way.</span> <span id="s343">Going the wrong direction.</span> <span id="s344">You should have asked us, you know.</span> <span id="s345">We would have told you where to how to take.</span> <span id="s346">So we had to go back and then we came to the forest.</span> <span id="s347">And there they got off you know and looked which tree to cut.</span> <span id="s348">In the meantime we all dispersed you know.</span> <span id="s349">And we, I went back, I went back to the place where they were building the, the pontoon.</span> <span id="s350">I got my belongings because I had to leave it there.</span> <span id="s351">Took my belongings, went there and then officer, captain Russian captain came on a motor boat and I spoke to him whether he will take me across.</span> <span id="s352">And he said do you have vodka.</span> <span id="s353">I said no I don’t have any vodka but I had a fountain pen and a pencil and a Parker fountain pen and a pencil in a red case and I said I give you this.</span> <span id="s354">He said ok.</span> <span id="s355">And then I said I had a friend and I said I have my brother.</span> <span id="s356">Of course he was not my brother.</span> <span id="s357">But I said I wanted him, take my brother as well.</span> <span id="s358">He said no, either you or nobody.</span> <span id="s359">It’s only you I take.</span> <span id="s360">I won’t take your brother.</span> <span id="s361">So I said ok.</span> <span id="s362">He said I have to go back to the other side of the river and then I come back and I take him.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">And in the meantime another officer came to the water edge and I started talking with him and apparently he was from I don’t know whether he was from NKVD, you know the KGB or something.</span> <span id="s364">Anyway, he was from an intelligence unit and he had to report somewhere on the other side in a village where there were the headquarters.</span> <span id="s365">To the headquarters of the Russian army.</span> <span id="s366">And he asked me whether I knew how to get there.</span> <span id="s367">I said yes, I know.</span> <span id="s368">And we started talking and I said you go with me and I show you exactly where to go, which road to take.</span> <span id="s369">So when the, when the boat came you know with the captain, he took, took us you know the Russian officer, he was I think a leftenant and myself and he drove us.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">But he was very leery.</span> <span id="s371">He didn’t talk to me.</span> <span id="s372">The captain didn’t talk to me because he was afraid.</span> <span id="s373">And I didn’t know how he recognized but apparently he recognized that he was you know somebody very important.</span> <span id="s374">Not to mess.</span> <span id="s375">So anyway, I said well I won’t give him now the pen.</span> <span id="s376">I said if I give him, I give him one piece, I give him the pencil.</span> <span id="s377">You know.</span> <span id="s378">So when we went out, he was standing like this with his hands you know behind him and as I walked out, I pressed you know the pencil into his hand and he didn’t say anything.</span> <span id="s379">You know because he was afraid of the, so we went and we walked.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">My home town was it was a fortress.</span> <span id="s381">And the Germans were defending it until I think the end of March.</span> <span id="s382">So when we came just they just capitulated a day or so before.</span> <span id="s383">So the many parts of the town were still burning you know.</span> <span id="s384">And there was a terrible destruction.</span> <span id="s385">Anyway we walked.</span> <span id="s386">I told him which way to, to take to the destination which he wanted to go and I went home.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">And I came to my parents.</span> <span id="s388">My parents were in the house but our house had I think 36 or something you know holes in it you know from, from the, from the artillery pieces you know which were made you know the Germans were defending.</span> <span id="s389">Our house was more or less on the outskirts of the, of the town.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: So it was bombed or shot at</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: No shot at by, by artillery you know.</span> <span id="s392">What do you call it, whatever.</span> <span id="s393">Anyway it was full of holes.</span> <span id="s394">And they, my father made a, in the cellar he made a bunker more or less you know to protect the, we are sitting all the time in the cellar.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: What was the reunion like?</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: Well you know when I escaped I did write a letter but I didn’t write a letter to my home.</span> <span id="s397">You know when I escaped from because I, I didn’t you know they probably, I didn’t’ want to endanger them.</span> <span id="s398">So I did write a letter to a neighbor and in this letter I also enclosed a letter for my parents.</span> <span id="s399">For, and I asked the neighbor to deliver it to my parents, which he did.</span> <span id="s400">So they knew that I escaped.</span> <span id="s401">But of course they didn’t know since you know what happened to me.</span> <span id="s402">The war was still going on.</span> <span id="s403">When I came to the house my father didn’t’ recognize me.</span> <span id="s404">Not at first you know.</span> <span id="s405">My mother right away did.</span> <span id="s406">And so as I say I stayed a few days oh and during this time I came, it was already quite dark when I came.</span> <span id="s407">When I left the Russian officer, came, it was getting very dark.</span> <span id="s408">And apparently the house was under observation because they next morning I was sleeping you know in my room and the Russians burst in with an automatic rifle, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">In my and pointed it to me in the bed.</span> <span id="s410">He thought that I was a German.</span> <span id="s411">He said and I told him, I showed him right, I said look I am here from Auschwitz and I came.</span> <span id="s412">Then he realized that he made a mistake and he left.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">But there were many instances.</span> <span id="s414">You never, suppose he didn’t’ know what it was.</span> <span id="s415">You know he would have taken me and you know.</span> <span id="s416">Well people don’t’ realize what war really is here.</span> <span id="s417">You know.</span> <span id="s418">Cause you have to experience it yourself you know before you can understand you know what it was and how it was.</span> <span id="s419">What we went through.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: And even after liberation there was so much hardship, wasn’t there?</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s422">I didn’t’ want to stay in my home town.</span> <span id="s423">There was nothing.</span> <span id="s424">There was a lot of destruction.</span> <span id="s425">And</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: Can you describe some of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: Well some, some streets were completely destroyed.</span> <span id="s428">You know they were blown up or yeah.</span> <span id="s429">The and then the Germans also tried to prevent it.</span> <span id="s430">They were flooding you know there were some lowlands which they tried to flood and they flooded it which of course they didn’t prevent it, the Russians from coming anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">The Russians were very callous about their dead, very callous.</span> <span id="s432">They were, there were many bodies of Russians lying for, for days.</span> <span id="s433">They were not, until the Polish population started buried them because they were afraid of, of you know epidemic and but they, they just couldn’t care less.</span> <span id="s434">Not only of course they didn’t’ care about the German bodies, but, but of their own they didn’t care.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Well when later on I went to Krakow and for instance in Krakow they well in the hospital when they operated you know they had to amputate the limbs and so on.</span> <span id="s436">they were throwing them out of the window in the street and absolutely I don’t know.</span> <span id="s437">They were a different kind of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: What was the very day life for people.</span> <span id="s439">And you said you don’t’ want to stay in your town for very long.</span> <span id="s440">But just what was everyday life getting food, you know the poverty.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: Well that was very scarcity of food.</span> <span id="s442">You can imagine many things were destroyed.</span> <span id="s443">Many tings since my home town was occupied, not only occupied but incorporated.</span> <span id="s444">The Germans removed everything what they could.</span> <span id="s445">So it, it was very, very difficult.</span> <span id="s446">Everything was you know Russian.</span> <span id="s447">You couldn’t’ buy.</span> <span id="s448">You had to have coupons you know in order to buy.</span> <span id="s449">Bread.</span> <span id="s450">I know my father had to go and he did go to the country you know to the peasants to get food.</span> <span id="s451">And only from peasants he knew because otherwise they wouldn’t sell either.</span> <span id="s452">So it, it was very difficult.</span> <span id="s453">It was difficult for everybody, for everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">And I myself went back to Krakow to see my friends and then we started we had to do something.</span> <span id="s455">You know the schools were still closed.</span> <span id="s456">You know during the occupation of Germany of course all the high schools and the universities were closed.</span> <span id="s457">We couldn’t’ study at all.</span> <span id="s458">And later on, I, I went to Krakow and we, we got together some of my friends you know Auschwitz friends.</span> <span id="s459">And we didn’t know what to do and eventually we had an idea.</span> <span id="s460">We wanted to open a, a café and a restaurant.</span> <span id="s461">And we were able to do it cause we got organized and we got a place.</span> <span id="s462">And the place was a villa which was given, not given to us but lent to us by the widow of a university professor who was killed in Auschwitz and she said yes you can have this you know and use it.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">And of course we would pay rent for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: And was that a difficult thing to do given that there was a lot of poverty to –</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: Well we somehow were able to I would say that maybe we had some privileges you know, a little privilege because we were you know from Auschwitz and everybody knew what we went through.</span> <span id="s466">So also the Russians, they didn’t and they couldn’t care less.</span> <span id="s467">But anyway we, we did get organized and we opened this restaurant and we had a, a band playing and we opened on a Sunday and we advertised you know as much as we could, although everything was hush, hush you know.</span> <span id="s468">there was a Polish security and the Russian security and so on.</span> <span id="s469">Anyway we opened this and it was a great success because we, we named the place you know that, the place would be at Auschwitz, former Auschwitz prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">And there was a great, tremendous amount of people came.</span> <span id="s471">It was so well that we had also a garden and there was no space.</span> <span id="s472">People were standing outside you know.</span> <span id="s473">And maybe because of the success, the next morning on Monday the Russians came and they closed it.</span> <span id="s474">they took everything you know, even the, the band.</span> <span id="s475">They left their instruments you know.</span> <span id="s476">They wouldn’t let the instruments, nothing and we were, they left with them.</span> <span id="s477">So we went and we couldn’t do anything, nothing.</span> <span id="s478">So we went to the Polish authorities.</span> <span id="s479">And they said well we can’t do anything.</span> <span id="s480">They couldn’t do anything so I said well are you going to compensate us.</span> <span id="s481">After all we did put some money into it.</span> <span id="s482">whatever our labor.</span> <span id="s483">Our labor and the lady, I mean the, the widow you know of this.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">They said we can’t do anything.</span> <span id="s485">Anyway afterwards they did compensate us and they give us a night, night club in the center of, of Krakow which we took over and we used.</span> <span id="s486">And we ran it for some, but I, I was very discouraged with everything which was going on at that time in Poland.</span> <span id="s487">It wasn’t the Poland which we expected.</span> <span id="s488">You know.</span> <span id="s489">For instance when the end of the war came you know the celebration.</span> <span id="s490">We didn’t’ celebrate at all.</span> <span id="s491">Nobody.</span> <span id="s492">We were all very much depressed.</span> <span id="s493">You know about the whole situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">And it was a very sad time.</span> <span id="s495">And I left Poland soon after it.</span> <span id="s496">I left, I left the business.</span> <span id="s497">I, I knew that nothing would come of it.</span> <span id="s498">and I left Poland with another friend of mine on in August of 1945.</span> <span id="s499">And I went maybe there was also part of it, maybe adventurous and I wanted to see the other world as what it was.</span> <span id="s500">and I went with him, we went through Czechoslovakia and Germany to Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">We, we got legitimate papers.</span> <span id="s502">Well legitimate we, there were, we bribed an official and he gave us the papers.</span> <span id="s503">Which I don’t’ know how good they would be and because we didn’t’ even test them.</span> <span id="s504">When we came to the border we didn’t’ go in just, we went through the border and bypassed the you know the place where the checked every, the checkpoints you know and got to the Czech, got to Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">But we also have Czechoslovakian visas which when we got into the train on the Czech side you know the Czechs came and they checked it and apparently they were good because they didn’t say so we went to Prague and at that time of course the war was finished and there was a demarcation line between the American forces and the Russian forces, between Prague and Pilsner you know.</span> <span id="s506">and Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s507">And there was a border and there of course they, the Russians wouldn’t let anybody out but the trains were so packed.</span> <span id="s508">To the brim.</span> <span id="s509">The roofs were full, everything was full you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">And the Russians when it came to the checkpoint you know everybody took a piece of paper and was waving because if the guards couldn’t come through the, you know it was too crowded so they had everybody went you know.</span> <span id="s511">You came to Pilsen and then we went the American occupation zone.</span> <span id="s512">And from there we went by train to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Again it was not easy.</span> <span id="s514">Again on the Czech German border there was again checking.</span> <span id="s515">But somehow we did, we went we got on a train which was evacuating Italian prisoner of war prisoners from Russia and it was going to Italy .</span> <span id="s516">So once we came to the border, we went together with the prisoners and they didn’t’ do anything.</span> <span id="s517">And we came to, came to Munich.</span> <span id="s518">And from Munich we went to the Polish prisoner of war camp.</span> <span id="s519">Near Murano.</span> <span id="s520">And from there the friend of mine had somebody an officer who was in the second Polish corps in Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Which the second Polish corps in Italy was fighting you know during the war with the 8th British army and the headquarters were in San Giorgio, Port of San Giorgio in Italy.</span> <span id="s522">And we got a passage from Murano to Italy and we went to Italy.</span> <span id="s523">Through the Brenner pass and then to Verona and Predappio.</span> <span id="s524">Predappio the birthplace of Mussolini and we stayed there.</span> <span id="s525">And then we came to Porto San Giorgio.</span> <span id="s526">And they, they accepted us you know into the army and the Second polish corps.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">I was by then an officer, you know second leftenant and I got assignment in Porto San Giorgio to the intelligence unit and I stayed in Italy til 1946.</span> <span id="s528">In 46 the corps was evacuated from Italy to Great Britain.</span> <span id="s529">And I came to Great Britain.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">(change tapes) (#2 – File RG-50.549.01.0012.02.03 – duration: 58:03)</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: This is tape 2 with Leonard Zawacki.</span> <span id="s532">I’m Dee Roberts and I wanted to know what was a lot of times people have expressed that liberation was a sort of an almost anticlimactic because the war the feelings and the survival was so heightened and you know was so the day to day survival was so intense that afterwards there was a sense of not knowing what to do with your life.</span> <span id="s533">Did you feel that at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: No, I, I don’t think I did feel this way.</span> <span id="s535">But now reflecting you know and, and going reflecting on these times, I know that I really wasn’t myself.</span> <span id="s536">You know I probably would have done, had I been had it been now, you know I probably would have acted differently.</span> <span id="s537">But when I, I came to Italy to me it was the best time of my life.</span> <span id="s538">You know it was a relaxation.</span> <span id="s539">Not only because of the climate and the, the geography.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">But I just felt very free and in the army I was free.</span> <span id="s541">I more or less could do whatever I wanted.</span> <span id="s542">And that, that was a great relaxation for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: How long were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: I was a year and as I mentioned before it was the best year of my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: What did you do during this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: Well I was assigned to the intelligence unit and I was in security section and I had a lot of free time and I had my own car and I could move and I did visit.</span> <span id="s547">Actually we the war was over and there were really there wasn’t much to do.</span> <span id="s548">Of course, at that time, not only the Polish forces but the Americans and so on, they thought that there would be another war between the two allies you know.</span> <span id="s549">Between the Soviet Union and America and England because the things started already to deteriorate.</span> <span id="s550">And eventually you know as we know now there was the Cold war.</span> <span id="s551">But it never did come to that So after, after a year in Italy we were all evacuated from Italy to Great Britain since we were part of the 8th British Army.</span> <span id="s552">And the, I must admit that I didn’t like it all, coming from sunny Italy to England.</span> <span id="s553">Matter of fact we came to, we came to Scotland and it was pouring rain and it was cold and dark and then we came to a camp.</span> <span id="s554">We came first to Knowsley Park in, near Liverpool near Prescott, Liverpool stayed there for a few days and then we went to another camp in Poulton, in Cheshire.</span> <span id="s555">And from there to Delmar camp, also in Cheshire, near Chester.</span> <span id="s556">And then eventually, I was demobbed and I went to London.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">And I finished my studies going to the London School of Foreign Trade and eventually started working.</span> <span id="s558">And then I met my wife in London.</span> <span id="s559">I worked in London for a very short period of time.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: Why don’t you say your wife’s name or her maiden name and tell me how you met.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: Oh I met her, I had, I quartered in a family in an English family.</span> <span id="s562">I had a room with a friend of mine and it was in the northern part of London, in let me think of it.</span> <span id="s563">Forgot the name.</span> <span id="s564">Can I. Yes, it was Hiberry New Park and if the parents the people who I lived were also friends of Frida’s.</span> <span id="s565">I (microphone bump) and she came there one day and (microphone problem).</span> <span id="s566">I met my future wife at Mr. and Mrs. Gardner and then eventually I did register.</span> <span id="s567">My friend registered with the American consulate you know to go to America.</span> <span id="s568">He had a aunt here.</span> <span id="s569">I didn’t have anybody in America.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">And he a, urged me also to register and I did.</span> <span id="s571">And before I knew the consulate sent me all the papers and then I went for an interview and before I knew I was in the states.</span> <span id="s572">Because there was an act of Congress that was passed that 18,000 ex-Polish service men will be admitted and I came here.</span> <span id="s573">As a matter of fact, I flew, British.</span> <span id="s574">(speaking to someone in another room) Yeah I came on an El Al Airline from London.</span> <span id="s575">Heathrow to Idyllwild at that time it was.</span> <span id="s576">JFK Kennedy was called Idyllwild.</span> <span id="s577">And I was sponsored by actually by a priest.</span> <span id="s578">It was arranged by my friend.</span> <span id="s579">A priest in Milwaukee.</span> <span id="s580">And I had some friends who lived also in New Jersey and I stayed with them for 3 weeks before I went to Milwaukee.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: Let’s back up a little bit.</span> <span id="s582">Did you feel a need to get married right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: No I didn’t, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: And to start a family.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s586">Never, didn’t have that need at all.</span> <span id="s587">I didn’t but not until I came to the states.</span> <span id="s588">The states and I felt a little lonely.</span> <span id="s589">Another strange you know very strange country for me, America.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: What year was this.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: It was in 1951.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: What was the difficulty in adjusting?</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: Well first of all I was very poor.</span> <span id="s594">I didn’t, I came here having $56 in my pocket.</span> <span id="s595">And I think half of it was, which I borrowed from my future wife.</span> <span id="s596">I we were not married.</span> <span id="s597">We got married in a year.</span> <span id="s598">So and then I started work in, in Milwaukee and I went to the factory.</span> <span id="s599">I had a job which I could have in an office.</span> <span id="s600">But they wanted to pay me $55 a week and my friend thought it was not enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">And he said you could make much more in going to a factory.</span> <span id="s602">So I went to a factory but I just couldn’t do it there.</span> <span id="s603">I was work, I was earning much more, almost a hundred dollars but the work was, I was making coat hangers, you kwon for the laundry and dry cleaning establishments and I just couldn’t put up with it and it was, I worked overtime and I got up at 5:00.</span> <span id="s604">And finally I said, no.</span> <span id="s605">And I, I quit the job and I came to New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">And then in New York I got myself a job with Chase Manhattan bank.</span> <span id="s607">You know the bank.</span> <span id="s608">I worked for, it was rather a menial job.</span> <span id="s609">It was for the, in a foreign department and didn’t’ pay much.</span> <span id="s610">$40, I think forty something dollars a week.</span> <span id="s611">I was getting.</span> <span id="s612">And then I after a year, I asked them for a promotion because I thought I was better educated to do the job I was doing there.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">And the supervisor, they were all Irish men and they were I think all keeping together and he wrote a letter, a memo to his superior and he said that in his opinion he thinks that he can do better job.</span> <span id="s614">And of course I, nothing came of it and I left.</span> <span id="s615">And I left.</span> <span id="s616">I went to a insurance company, Cosmopolitan Mutual Insurance Company and I stayed there for ten years.</span> <span id="s617">And I think I did progress there.</span> <span id="s618">And then I left them again.</span> <span id="s619">And I went to another company.</span> <span id="s620">New York fire and marine underwriters.</span> <span id="s621">And there, there I became the chief accountant.</span> <span id="s622">And then from there I think I was 8 years there.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">The company merged and they wanted to go to Milwaukee and be part of Milwaukee so I left and I went with AIG, American International Group, a group of companies which was worldwide company.</span> <span id="s624">And I stayed there for the next seven years.</span> <span id="s625">And from there I got transferred.</span> <span id="s626">I asked for the transfer.</span> <span id="s627">Frieda wanted to go back to England so they have big offices in London.</span> <span id="s628">SO I got a transfer and went to London and</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: I’m going to back track a little bit here.</span> <span id="s630">You said that this is a strange country.</span> <span id="s631">What was strange.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">A: Well it was strange insofar that it wasn’t European.</span> <span id="s633">You know.</span> <span id="s634">I, I mean I was brought up in Europe and England and Italy.</span> <span id="s635">And it was a little, a little rough.</span> <span id="s636">You know some of the people.</span> <span id="s637">I also there were mostly you know they were very how do you say.</span> <span id="s638">Very understanding but, but they in many instances they were rather how do you say not to offend anybody.</span> <span id="s639">But they were gruff you know and loud and, and pushy you know and I wasn’t used to that.</span> <span id="s640">And of course also I in the east I really didn’t like the climate.</span> <span id="s641">The climate was to me, especially later on you know when I worked in New York, the subways, the humidity in the summer, I just can’t, I couldn’t stand it.</span> <span id="s642">You know you took a shower in the morning, went in the subway and you were already perspiring you know and you were wet.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">At that time the subways were not of course were not air conditioned.</span> <span id="s644">And, and the pushing and shoving and you know almost every day there were fights on the, on the subways.</span> <span id="s645">You know you’re not exposed when you live in Portland or somewhere else but in New York.</span> <span id="s646">And New Yorkers were generally very, very rough and tough and, and even the police were not very kind.</span> <span id="s647">You know.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">I remember one instance where I came I was new in New York, and I asked.</span> <span id="s649">I had a friend who lived on park Avenue.</span> <span id="s650">I think I was on 5th Avenue and I asked the policeman ad the corner.</span> <span id="s651">I said could you please direct me.</span> <span id="s652">And I was very polite where Par Avenue is and he didn’t’ utter a word.</span> <span id="s653">He just motioned with his hand.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">And in other instance they were not very, very pleasant.</span> <span id="s655">But you know I overcame, overcome this.</span> <span id="s656">you know I’m not used to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: You also mentioned loneliness</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: Well loneliness because I did, although I had family but I already helped many friends in England, many friends and I knew a family in New York but it wasn’t the same.</span> <span id="s659">They were elderly and they had a daughter.</span> <span id="s660">Maybe they wanted me to marry the daughter but, but I you know besides that I didn’t’ have anybody.</span> <span id="s661">And this, this you know this was a one of the reasons I was lonely.</span> <span id="s662">And eventually I did ask my future wife to and she came, came over in 52.</span> <span id="s663">In April we got married.</span> <span id="s664">Then we established our own household.</span> <span id="s665">First we had a furnished apartment in Brooklyn And we stayed there for a year and then we got our own apartment in Jackson Heights in Queens and we got our own furniture and then you know first we had only one bedroom.</span> <span id="s666">Afterwards we had two bedroom apartment.</span> <span id="s667">And then we moved from there to, to Flushing.</span> <span id="s668">You know New York as any big city I think is changing very rapidly.</span> <span id="s669">You know the neighborhoods change, especially in New York.</span> <span id="s670">Jackson Heights after a while I think we lived there ten years.</span> <span id="s671">You know it started changing.</span> <span id="s672">Many transients, mostly from South America and then it became a part of, there were many drugs you know dealers around, South America, Colombia and so on.</span> <span id="s673">So we moved out.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">And then we moved as I said in 76 we moved to England.</span> <span id="s675">I got a transfer.</span> <span id="s676">But again I didn’t like then England.</span> <span id="s677">I was already used to America you know.</span> <span id="s678">and I was Americanized and I didn’t like England.</span> <span id="s679">Matter of fact Frieda didn’t like because England started changing.</span> <span id="s680">It was not the same thing as when we, so I stayed there only 15 months.</span> <span id="s681">And then I asked for a transfer back but the company said no.</span> <span id="s682">We just transferred you.</span> <span id="s683">no you can’t so I said all right well I quit.</span> <span id="s684">And</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: Was it difficult to find a feel that there’s a home for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: No, I think my home is now here.</span> <span id="s687">Now I, I</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: Before that</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: Before, yes, yes it was.</span> <span id="s690">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q: Were you looking for a home?</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: Oh yes, yes.</span> <span id="s693">I you know I, I you know I.</span> <span id="s694">After a while in New York, we did make some friends.</span> <span id="s695">I had some friends, although not very close you know.</span> <span id="s696">They were not Polish really.</span> <span id="s697">One was an Austrian friend and the other one was a Czech.</span> <span id="s698">So I didn’t have too many Polish friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: Did you ever think about going back to Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: No.</span> <span id="s701">I never did, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: I don’t know why, why, probably one of the reasons was the economic situation.</span> <span id="s704">And the political situation.</span> <span id="s705">I just didn’t want to live under the Communist you know regimes.</span> <span id="s706">I because I went there many times.</span> <span id="s707">I the first time I went to Poland you know after I became an American citizen, which was in 1956.</span> <span id="s708">And I went to Poland in 58 and I saw you know what was going on.</span> <span id="s709">I couldn’t, I couldn’t live there.</span> <span id="s710">It was, first of all the people were not free.</span> <span id="s711">You know and they, it was a police state.</span> <span id="s712">You know I had to go to the police when I arrived there, to register.</span> <span id="s713">It’s a police state.</span> <span id="s714">and they took a you know they interrogated me and I had to sign you know the, the it was like confession.</span> <span id="s715">What I was doing and what and why.</span> <span id="s716">And I had to sign it you know.</span> <span id="s717">My god.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">And no I couldn’t, I couldn’t’ live there.</span> <span id="s719">I wouldn’t.</span> <span id="s720">And now, now that it is a free country you know I just don’t’ think about it.</span> <span id="s721">I have been living here too long.</span> <span id="s722">and you know I wouldn’t, wouldn’t live there, couldn’t.</span> <span id="s723">Look I spent most of my adult life, most abroad.</span> <span id="s724">And you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: You were talking about all the different jobs that you’ve been employed in.</span> <span id="s726">Did you ever talk to people about your war experiences during that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: Yes, I did I’m sure.</span> <span id="s728">I did speak about.</span> <span id="s729">I, I myself think that I was quite successful later on in life, you know after I quit the job in London.</span> <span id="s730">I did get a job right away in America.</span> <span id="s731">And back in America with by that time I specialized in reinsurance business and I got a job with a company which was part of CIT financial corporation and they bought me back and they paid for my passage and the furniture because when I went to England we went with all our furniture.</span> <span id="s732">Well not all but some of the furniture.</span> <span id="s733">Bu the first company which transferred me paid for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">And then this company which hired me back.</span> <span id="s735">At that time I was already 62 years old.</span> <span id="s736">You know so at 62 not anybody, everybody can find another job but I was able to because I think my services were you know such that , that they needed me and I became a vice president and later on I did and I was also director, you know the board of directors.</span> <span id="s737">And then after board of directors.</span> <span id="s738">Then later on I became a consultant and I worked on my own account.</span> <span id="s739">And I well and I you know for an immigrant I think I, I did quite well.</span> <span id="s740">So for this I mean I am very grateful and I am as I said, although the beginnings were very hard I think I did make something of it.</span> <span id="s741">And I didn’t, didn’t think too much about my past.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Although as I said, when I reflect on it, I at times I wasn’t quite myself after I left the you know after I escaped from because it did leave something on my mind you know.</span> <span id="s743">for years, which I spent in the concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Q: You say you weren’t quite yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: Well you know when I, when I think back you know that maybe I would have done things differently you know in some ways and I, I just know that I wasn’t quite you know.</span> <span id="s746">I you know I never tried because for instance I never tried to talk about it.</span> <span id="s747">I didn’t want to talk about it.</span> <span id="s748">I didn’t want to recall it.</span> <span id="s749">So I kept it you know buttoned up.</span> <span id="s750">And I did you know then try for compensation and but it was a very (minimal?)</span> <span id="s751">compensation which I did get.</span> <span id="s752">And I didn’t ever follow this through.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">I probably because as a people in same circumstances as I you know didn’t get much more money out of the German government but I just really didn’t’, didn’t want.</span> <span id="s754">All I did get, I got 1800 dollars I don’t know what year it was out of just a lawyer took 400.</span> <span id="s755">And I think I got 1400 which you know it’s nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">But you know I probably could claim on some physical disability or mental disability or something of the kind.</span> <span id="s757">I didn’t.</span> <span id="s758">I was lucky and grateful that I came out alive and I don’t’ think that I have any physical disability or mental disability.</span> <span id="s759">Although maybe you know that something was playing on my mind anyway because it had to leave some, something you know.</span> <span id="s760">The things which I saw and experienced.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Q: I read that you had recurring nightmares</span></p> <p><span id="s762">A: I, I did, sometimes I do yes, I do.</span> <span id="s763">I have well maybe it’s also due because I still read about this and this you know when I read and I, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: Do you read about the war experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">A; Yeah the war.</span> <span id="s766">It’s very hard to explain.</span> <span id="s767">You know how people could be that way if what kind of people they were that they could do such you know terrible things, I mean gruesome things.</span> <span id="s768">So that, that I do have nightmares but not as much as I used to.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: Do you remember when they first started?</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: Oh no not really I couldn’t tell you but I think they started much later than, not right at the beginning because I tried to push it away and I think I pushed, I was very successful at pushing.</span> <span id="s771">I didn’t want to think and I didn’t’ talk about it you know until I started talking.</span> <span id="s772">Then, then they came back.</span> <span id="s773">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q: What kind of dreams do you have, what kind of dreams.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A: Oh things are always terrible dreams.</span> <span id="s776">You know somebody trying to kill me and something like that.</span> <span id="s777">most being killed or you know something to this of this nature yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: How do you think that this war experience shaped your character?</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: Well I think I became more tolerant.</span> <span id="s780">You know I matured more.</span> <span id="s781">I was you know as youth I you know you are always full of energy and you know many dislikes and not very tolerant you know to others, other people think and I think I’m much more tolerant.</span> <span id="s782">Much more understanding.</span> <span id="s783">And I, I think I am a better person not that I don’t know as I was a bad person but I, I’m more understanding you know much, I am more forgiving.</span> <span id="s784">That’s what it, what I think I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: You also have had incredible survival skills.</span> <span id="s786">And how has that shaped you?</span></p> <p><span id="s787">A: Yes well I can tell you that from the first moment when I was arrested I thought of nothing else but how to get out.</span> <span id="s788">How to I never did give up, never did.</span> <span id="s789">I never lost you know hope.</span> <span id="s790">And I never, and I, I have tried, always tried to be very inconspicuous.</span> <span id="s791">I, I knew many people in the camp you know who tried to be very heroic you know and, and I, I realized right from the beginning that the best way was to be do yourself, but keep quiet you know to yourself.</span> <span id="s792">And not to try to be a hero.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">But I never gave hope, up hope you know of surviving and I never gave up hope of escaping.</span> <span id="s794">It always was on my mind to escape.</span> <span id="s795">Matter of fact the first day when they arrested me I already thought to escape while they were arresting me.</span> <span id="s796">I just you know didn’t know enough because we were, we came to the prison.</span> <span id="s797">It was a reception room which was close to the exit room.</span> <span id="s798">And you had to go in order to escape you had to just had to go out of the reception room.</span> <span id="s799">Then you had to go through two gates.</span> <span id="s800">You know where there were guards.</span> <span id="s801">I thought that, I thought since I didn’t speak E, German you know that I would bluff my way through the gates, you know because at that time there were still Polish guards in the prison.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">But I, I am afraid I didn’t’ have enough courage and I didn’t know enough you know how the whole prison system operated.</span> <span id="s803">But I did think about it.</span> <span id="s804">I did think because I was in civilian clothes you know when they arrested me and I was well dressed and as a German I probably could say heil Hitler you know and the Polish guards wouldn’t know the difference.</span> <span id="s805">And maybe they would let me through.</span> <span id="s806">But I didn’t do it.</span> <span id="s807">But I did think, I never as I said, I never lost hope.</span> <span id="s808">Never lost hope.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: And the courage to take that chance too.</span> <span id="s810">Where does that come from?</span> <span id="s811">because a lot of people were afraid to take the chance because they might be killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: I don’t know I really, it’s very hard to express.</span> <span id="s813">You either have it or you don’t have it.</span> <span id="s814">We, when I tried to escape from Auschwitz we had a different plan and to escape and when the time came we tried to escape as civilians and one of the fellows just couldn’t it.</span> <span id="s815">He just couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s816">He was shaking like a leaf.</span> <span id="s817">And he said I can’t do it, and we had to abandon him.</span> <span id="s818">And so we could do it.</span> <span id="s819">I did.</span> <span id="s820">I, I don’t say that I was not afraid or you know but, but I took the chance.</span> <span id="s821">And we had very close, very close calls during the escape.</span> <span id="s822">We had close calls but we made it.</span> <span id="s823">You know but we believed in ourselves and we believed in that we will be successful.</span> <span id="s824">So we were, but I took the chance and you know for we also knew what consequences would be if we didn’t succeed.</span> <span id="s825">And we were prepared for this.</span> <span id="s826">That we had the poison, you know the cyanide that we would take.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">And kill ourselves because we knew that we would be killed anyway and tortured before being killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: Did you feel that a lot of people helped you along the way during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: Yes, people were helpful, yes.</span> <span id="s830">I think we, we were more united you know during the war than we are now.</span> <span id="s831">And I am talking about Poland.</span> <span id="s832">We were because we had a common enemy.</span> <span id="s833">You know we had a common which was Germany and we were all united and we were all fighting you know to survive.</span> <span id="s834">Not that there were no, no exceptions.</span> <span id="s835">You know there were exceptions.</span> <span id="s836">Many, some of the Poles you know collaborated, but there were very few.</span> <span id="s837">Nobody in Poland collaborated who was on the top you know.</span> <span id="s838">I mean of any stature.</span> <span id="s839">Like in different countries.</span> <span id="s840">Like for instance in, in Norway, Quisling you know who collaborated openly you know with the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">In Poland we didn’t.</span> <span id="s842">We were, and we were all united.</span> <span id="s843">Now it, it changed when the you know when the Polish government, the Communist government came to power you know then it changed.</span> <span id="s844">There was no unity.</span> <span id="s845">And people you know there were some, those who were Communist you know.</span> <span id="s846">They were you know pro-Russian and the others were opposed to it.</span> <span id="s847">And, and the division started, but not during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Now people can say you know that many I think especially as I don’t know whether you know but Poland had I think one of the largest you know minority Jewish population minority in Poland, in, in the world.</span> <span id="s849">There were over 3 million Jews.</span> <span id="s850">Now many Jews, the Jews accused us that we didn’t do much more to help the Jews.</span> <span id="s851">I think the Poles did more than any other country you know.</span> <span id="s852">They, you know to the Jews.</span> <span id="s853">And they did it with great risk to themselves, you know because the Germans were particularly you know against the Jews and anybody who would help them.</span> <span id="s854">So you know the, they just I think they are not fair you know in, in this assumption.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Not all.</span> <span id="s856">Many Jews are very fair.</span> <span id="s857">You know and they especially this book you know for instance says.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Q: Say the name of the book.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">A: Oh the name of the book is Hitler’s Willing Executioners you know by Daniel Jonah Goldhagen.</span> <span id="s860">He is very fair in, in his assumption.</span> <span id="s861">For instance I heard well many Jews say that the concentration camps were in Poland because of the, the Poles being not accessories but helping or willing you know to, to, well which is complete nonsense.</span> <span id="s862">The only thing is that Poland was centrally located in Europe and the biggest concentration of Jews was in Poland and it was out of logistic you know things that they, that the concentration camps were there, not because of anybody, because the Polish population wanted to.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">On the contrary you know they never found, found any Poles who would help in the destruction of the Jewish population.</span> <span id="s864">But and here and this author of this book you know says that mostly those who helped the Germans were the Lithuanians and the Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s865">And the, it is a fact because there were Ukrainian units you know SS who were helping the, the Germans.</span> <span id="s866">So I think the record should be kept straight.</span> <span id="s867">And you know fair is fair.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">I don’t say that there were not people who, who betrayed Jews but then on the other hand it was also in some cases where the Jews betrayed Poles.</span> <span id="s869">So we have to be very, very careful and you know and, and fair.</span> <span id="s870">And honest.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Q: Do you have kids</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: No we don’t’ have any children.</span> <span id="s873">No.</span> <span id="s874">we, I know I got married.</span> <span id="s875">I wasn’t young.</span> <span id="s876">And Frieda was you know she, Frieda is older than I and we were, came to this country.</span> <span id="s877">You know we had to make a living and beside that I just didn’t feel like having children.</span> <span id="s878">I didn’t and well now when you see you know how some of the youth, you know developed here you sometimes wonder maybe it was a good thing.</span> <span id="s879">But we didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">You know that this country is not very how do you say, well I mean already this country everywhere now is change, the world is changing very rapidly with all the communications you know between the different countries.</span> <span id="s881">You know so the, the drug situation and so on.</span> <span id="s882">Maybe we can describe, maybe it’s better that we didn’t have children.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">Q: Do you think that young people understand the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s885">I, I do you know I’m asked by the college and, and the high schools and I do talk.</span> <span id="s886">And surprisingly they do.</span> <span id="s887">They know about it.</span> <span id="s888">Of course they you know they would like and they want to hear firsthand you know and I did to speak and I, they have the firsthand account.</span> <span id="s889">And of course they are, you know they are always very interested you know how I managed to escape.</span> <span id="s890">And but I get very, very nice letters from the youngsters you know after my, my talk.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">They write to me.</span> <span id="s892">And it is very rewarding to you know to read it.</span> <span id="s893">And</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Q: Is it very difficult to start talking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s895">A: No it was difficult at the beginning.</span> <span id="s896">It was</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Q: When was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: Well it was probably some six years ago, yeah.</span> <span id="s899">I was much more emotional when I spoke.</span> <span id="s900">Matter of fact I, my first talk was to a Rotary club.</span> <span id="s901">I was not a member of the Rotary Club but they asked me to speak and, and I didn’t know how I will, it was a very emotional speech, so I was told.</span> <span id="s902">I mean I didn’t listen.</span> <span id="s903">I talked and talked and I was only accorded half an hour but I think I spoke for an hour and then nobody left there.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">And but now I am, I don’t’ have difficulty.</span> <span id="s905">I can speak and very seldom do I get emotional.</span> <span id="s906">You know.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">Q: That first speech what did you say, what did you talk about.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">A: Oh I spoke about the whole thing you know about the war and how it worked.</span> <span id="s909">And I gave some statistics you know, what you know how what the sufferings were and I you know I mean the biggest suffering of course were the Jews.</span> <span id="s910">Took the well the crimes you know victims of the regime.</span> <span id="s911">But it has to be remembered you know, although the 6 million Jews you know perished.</span> <span id="s912">There were also 5 million of non-Jews you know who perished.</span> <span id="s913">And they should also be remembered.</span> <span id="s914">And we shouldn’t you know concentrate only on, on the Jews and be fair you know to both sides.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">I, I know that you know the other Christians you know were persecuted because of the, their beliefs and of their political views you know and the Jews were just you know persecuted because of their, their race.</span> <span id="s916">But nevertheless you know the others were also victims.</span> <span id="s917">So we just can’t you know disregard them and should be fair to the other victims.</span> <span id="s918">You know.</span> <span id="s919">So.</span> <span id="s920">That’s how I feel about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">Q: What kind of conclusions have you come to about all the reasons for why this happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">A: Well you know there, there is all, especially here in this country once you know from the Jewish community one hears you know well the Polish anti-Semitism and they completely disregard you know the German anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s923">Anti-Semitism I think is everywhere.</span> <span id="s924">You know it is in America and this and any other country.</span> <span id="s925">But the intensity of it may be in Poland it was more intense because there were more Jews.</span> <span id="s926">But they completely disregard the intensity of the anti-Semitism which was in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">And, and that’s where it all started.</span> <span id="s928">And I, I forgot.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q: Just the reasons why did this happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: And now the reasons were first of all you know the, the anti, anti-Semitism you know existed in Germany.</span> <span id="s931">And of course it was how do you say.</span> <span id="s932">It was can’t find the proper word.</span> <span id="s933">It was intensified by the regime, of the Nazi regime.</span> <span id="s934">You know their policy was the extermination of Jews and it was not only the, it was the policy of Hitler and, and, and since the ground you know the anti, anti-Semitism was there anyway, it you know when, when they came with the propaganda you know against the Jews it fell on very fertile ground.</span> <span id="s935">And that was the reason why you know the.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Now why there was anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s937">Anti-Semitism was because most of the Jews were quite prosperous.</span> <span id="s938">I, I am talking about Germany.</span> <span id="s939">In Poland you know we had many, many, very many poor Jews.</span> <span id="s940">But in Germany most of them were quite prosperous and there was hate and jealousy and this all contributed you know to, to this problem of, of the, the Jewish problem.</span> <span id="s941">And the Jewish problem was also in Poland and in Russia.</span> <span id="s942">We first of all Poland was a rather poor country.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">And, and you know we had a minority, a Jewish minority of approximately 10, ten percent, close to ten percent.</span> <span id="s944">And then and we also had in prewar Poland we had a minority of Ukrainian minority of 15%.</span> <span id="s945">So and I think the Ukrainians are even more hateful you know more anti-Semitic than, than the Poles were.</span> <span id="s946">But, but, but you know the Poles were not to the extent.</span> <span id="s947">They always say there were Polish pogroms.</span> <span id="s948">There were no Polish pogroms because the pogroms which were existed you know were during the Russian occupation of Poland.</span> <span id="s949">And a pogrom has to be sanctioned by the government.</span> <span id="s950">And in Poland during the, the existence you know after the First World War, the, between the two world wars you know which Poland was in existence for 20 years.</span> <span id="s951">It never was any, anything, any pogroms sanctioned by the Polish government.</span> <span id="s952">But the pogroms were sanctioned in you know as we know in, in Germany and in Russia and we know what happened you know to the Jews you know during the last war.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">We know that 6 million of them were, perished.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Q: For you personally what does it all mean and why did it happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">A: Well I, I think it happened you know the Holocaust happened because of, of hatred which was you know and the hatred you know they vented it, they more or less, Hitler blamed the Jews and made a scapegoat of them for all the ills in Germany and in Europe that well and you know and there are many reasons.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">One reason is for instance as far as the Catholic church is concerned you know that they blame the Jews for killing you know Jesus.</span> <span id="s957">But you know so, so you know so the Catholics probably those less intelligent you know accept this you know as, as the reason to hate the Jews.</span> <span id="s958">Others take the reason you know because they are better off, because one has to accept that they are very industrious people.</span> <span id="s959">And very educated most of them.</span> <span id="s960">And very clever.</span> <span id="s961">You know and this you know is also cause for hating.</span> <span id="s962">So that, that there are many reasons.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">I think the reasons are also very well described in this book which I mentioned you know the Hitler’s Willing Executioners.</span> <span id="s964">He, he very well describes you know what how, what was the cause you know to this holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">And of course they and it was popular for the Germans you know for the Nazis it was a very popular thing to do because it united and anybody today nobody talks about German anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s966">I don’t’ know why.</span> <span id="s967">Of course there are not many Jews left in, in Germany.</span> <span id="s968">But there neither are there any many Jews left in Poland and yet they always talk about the Polish anti-Semitism.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">Q: Something just I hearing your experiences how do you think people can be so cruel.</span> <span id="s970">How can they have all that hate.</span> <span id="s971">How can the cruelty that you witnessed how is that possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">A: Well that is very hard to, you know to understand.</span> <span id="s973">I don’t know you probably have to be born but the cruelty I mean it was fueled by, by the general policy you know of the regime.</span> <span id="s974">I think in Germany.</span> <span id="s975">And you know the hatred, the you know they had publications.</span> <span id="s976">The publications and I think it was Stürmer which was a the publication of the Julius Streicher who was one of the greatest you know haters of the Jews.</span> <span id="s977">So you can inflame this in a propaganda.</span> <span id="s978">Goebbels I think he was a master of propaganda.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">But if you talked to people and tell them this, this that the Jews were this and that, and that you know eventually it falls on, on fertile ground and people become, but otherwise I just don’t know.</span> <span id="s980">but maybe the Germans are just cruel people.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">Q: I’m just thinking –</span></p> <p><span id="s982">A: I think it, and I think it’s you know it you will find cruel people in any nation, in you know there are sadists you know.</span> <span id="s983">Why do we have killings here like what was this fellow Daumer or something.</span> <span id="s984">I mean it happens.</span> <span id="s985">How do you blame this.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Q: What did you learn?</span></p> <p><span id="s987">A: Well as I said, I, I learned tolerance.</span> <span id="s988">You know I, I, I don’t’ think I was not tolerant but, but I, I have I appreciate it more you know.</span> <span id="s989">That I think everybody should have the chance to be what he wants to be and what he is.</span></p> <p><span id="s990">Q: Do you think your character was tested.</span></p> <p><span id="s991">A: I don’t, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s992">You know I myself some, you know of course I can’t judge myself too well, but other people.</span> <span id="s993">I think I was always a very you know understanding person.</span> <span id="s994">You know I think I was good person.</span> <span id="s995">I never got in any mischief.</span> <span id="s996">I never, you know in, in the camp You know, I, I couldn’t hit and I wouldn’t hit anybody.</span> <span id="s997">I mean matter of fact, I at one point in the camp I was, I was they made me because of my German they made me a clerk on the, on the block.</span> <span id="s998">And as a clerk I had to keep the evidence of the prisoners you know.</span> <span id="s999">How many prisoners there were and who went to another block and so on and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Well one and there were reports you know the roll calls were twice.</span> <span id="s1001">And well at first there were 3 times a day and then afterwards they were twice a day.</span> <span id="s1002">And at one evening roll call, I got a from the main office you know that one prisoner had the next morning had to be delivered you know to the main office.</span> <span id="s1003">And apparently I was not supposed to tell in this until after the roll call.</span> <span id="s1004">But I told him before the roll call.</span> <span id="s1005">Now what this fellow apparently knew or suspected what is going to happen, that he probably will be executed so I and I told him this before the roll call so when I told him, he disappeared.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">But we were already in the compound and he couldn’t escape.</span> <span id="s1007">It was impossible to escape from there but, but what happened he, he hid himself in one of the blocks.</span> <span id="s1008">One of the blocks that was being built and he between the scaffolding you know he hid himself.</span> <span id="s1009">Of course in this delayed the, the roll call because they had to find him.</span> <span id="s1010">And they found him very soon afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">So afterwards you know the, the block head he fired me right away.</span> <span id="s1012">He said you know you shouldn’t have told him this and he fired and I was punished to be sent to very heavy work and, and the SS told him that I, that he should watch me that the heaviest possible work would be assigned to me.</span> <span id="s1013">So when we came back after the roll call one of the fellows said why don’t you hit him.</span> <span id="s1014">You know because he caused you so much grief.</span> <span id="s1015">I said why should I hit him.</span> <span id="s1016">I just couldn’t, I why should I do this.</span> <span id="s1017">This poor soul you know probably will be dead tomorrow and why should do it and what would it do to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">So well that’s my character.</span> <span id="s1019">I just couldn’t, couldn’t do that and I wouldn’t’ do it.</span> <span id="s1020">couldn’t, couldn’t do another human being.</span> <span id="s1021">That I am, how I felt and I never did anybody any harm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">But there were people you know there were people.</span> <span id="s1023">There were prisoners themselves you know who behaved very, very, very badly.</span> <span id="s1024">And they were punished later on.</span> <span id="s1025">And, and look it, not only was limited you know to the German prisoners because there were German criminal prisoners.</span> <span id="s1026">There were also Polish prisoners you know who were very, very cruel to other people.</span> <span id="s1027">And there were Jewish prisoners who were cruel.</span> <span id="s1028">They there were Jews who were also you know block elders you know and who behaved.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">One has to understand that some people thought that if they are going to be cruel or be very tough on other prisoners that they will save their own skin.</span> <span id="s1030">You know the, the, the instinct of survival was very, very strong in everybody and some people thought through cruelty to others you know they will save their skin and others as I think in my case you know I just tried to be inconspicuous you know and, and just behave.</span> <span id="s1031">You know as a human being.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">I also you know there, there were prisoners who for instance were stealing from other prisoners you know bread you know which was punishable.</span> <span id="s1033">If you were caught stealing another prisoner’s bread which was you know our, our you know food was very meager, it meant that this guy, the other prisoner from whom you stole the bread, he probably is going to die.</span> <span id="s1034">So it was punishable by death and it was punishable by death, by the prisoners themselves you know it was, they took him to work.</span> <span id="s1035">Some of the capos or something.</span> <span id="s1036">He was told that this fellow stole the bread and they, they killed him.</span> <span id="s1037">So there were many terrible things you know which I many times I don’t want to recall them.</span> <span id="s1038">Anything else</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: Take a tape break here (#3 – File RG-50.549.01.0012.03.03 – duration: 36:41)</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">Q: This is tape 3, I’m Dee Roberts with Leonard Zawacki.</span> <span id="s1041">We had just talked about different ways that this has shaped your character, that the Holocaust and war experience.</span> <span id="s1042">How to what do you attribute I guess your resilience.</span> <span id="s1043">And your survival</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">A: I, I suppose as anybody else you know the will to, to survive and to live, to, to live.</span> <span id="s1045">That’s survival instinct.</span> <span id="s1046">But maybe it’s stronger in me than anybody else.</span> <span id="s1047">And I, I think it’s also partially a, you know that I did survive as that has a lot to do with it, I think.</span> <span id="s1048">I, I really do think that there is a lot you know.</span> <span id="s1049">Luck has a lot to do with.</span> <span id="s1050">because you know there were many, many times there were very strong people which you thought and they would perish and of course once you lost will to, to live you know you were finished.</span> <span id="s1051">But if you had a strong will to live you survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">Q: This is sort of off the track but did you ever see or visit any displaced persons camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">A: No, I never did.</span> <span id="s1054">I never did, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">Q: Do you keep in touch with other survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">A: I do.</span> <span id="s1057">I, I do keep in touch with the fellow who escaped with me.</span> <span id="s1058">You know who was also changed into SS uniform and took the other four colleagues of ours out of the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">A: His name is Alfonse Shuminski and he is I think he and myself are the only survivors of the six who escaped.</span> <span id="s1061">I know that 3 of them are dead and, and the one we never heard of you know so he disappeared.</span> <span id="s1062">Somewhere but I’m sure, I feel that he is also dead.</span> <span id="s1063">And now this Alfonse Shuminski who lives in Poland is, is he had a stroke but he can, he can move.</span> <span id="s1064">It wasn’t very severe stroke.</span> <span id="s1065">But his speech is a little blurred, he cannot speak.</span> <span id="s1066">Do you say blurred or the vision is blurred.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">Q: Slurred.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Q: Other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">A: Yes and I have other people.</span> <span id="s1071">I was in touch with one fellow who was as I told you in Edmonton and he died last year and then there is a fellow who lives in Menlo Park.</span> <span id="s1072">And I Sometimes am in touch with him.</span> <span id="s1073">And then I am in touch with in Poland, in Krakow, one fellow name is Tatatosh Zaleski.</span> <span id="s1074">And then a friend in my home town who actually helped me you know and maybe he was really the cause that I did survive because he introduced me to, to somebody and the carpentry you know and I got the job as a carpenter.</span> <span id="s1075">And, I, I am in touch with him.</span> <span id="s1076">I go quite frequently or used to, quite frequently go to Poland.</span> <span id="s1077">And now since my wife is not so well you know I don’t.</span> <span id="s1078">I, I hope to go you know this year.</span> <span id="s1079">Hope to go in the fall, maybe in the late summer to Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">Q: How many times have you been back to Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">A: Oh I was probably five or six times and my wife was there twice with me.</span> <span id="s1082">I was, I was last the year before you know for the anniversary, the 50th anniversary.</span> <span id="s1083">I was in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">Q: What was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">A: Well it was a very, very sad, very sad occasion you know.</span> <span id="s1086">There were many people.</span> <span id="s1087">Frankly I didn’t like that because it was a show and I don’t’ agree with it.</span> <span id="s1088">You know there were many dignitaries of, from all over and I think the survivors were rather pushed aside you know were as, as I think they should be in the forefront and not the dignitaries.</span> <span id="s1089">I thought it was poorly organized.</span> <span id="s1090">It was wrong.</span> <span id="s1091">And I think many other people thought the same way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">That you know well I just didn’t like it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">Q: What about some times before.</span> <span id="s1094">Why would you go back so many times?</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">A: Well I went back because there were occasions and I wanted to show my wife you know.</span> <span id="s1096">And then I , then I went once, a Jewish girl from here, matter of fact she is from Oregon and she was an exchange student in Poland and I wanted her to see what it was so I took her there.</span> <span id="s1097">And then I took once my, my great niece you know I wanted her to see it.</span> <span id="s1098">So I took her.</span> <span id="s1099">Only because I, I mean for myself I know it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Oh yeah and then I took once a group of, from Medford, you know some 20 people from Medford went and I took them you know as a guide.</span> <span id="s1101">We opened a Rotary Club in touring Poland and afterwards we toured Poland and we went to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1102">And</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">Q: Medford is ten miles from Ashland so that you took some people that you knew basically</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">A: Yes, well there were Rotarians you know and their families and we went actually for a tour for the opening of the Rotary club in Poland but then we also toured, not only Poland but also Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1105">We were in Prague Czech somewhere, but on the way we went to Auschwitz and they wanted to see Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">Q: So the main reasons were to share this experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1108">I</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">Q: Why did you feel that was necessary.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">A: Well, first of all I wanted as many people to know what, what it was like and what the sufferings were you know.</span> <span id="s1111">What people went through.</span> <span id="s1112">Not that you know many of the, the gas chambers and so on destroyed in Auschwitz you know, in Birkenau actually.</span> <span id="s1113">They blew them up but there are still many, many things you know which are there and which indicate you know what, what kind of a place it was.</span> <span id="s1114">Matter of fact when I was describing because I was serving as a guide, I did break down you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">Because it recalls you know for instance you know you witnessed the hangings there which were always public.</span> <span id="s1116">And you know the, nobody is as strong as they think they are.</span> <span id="s1117">So I, I did break down.</span> <span id="s1118">But I always try to recover very fast and I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">Q: I think you’re allowed to break down.</span> <span id="s1120">In your successful life, what kind of things do you attribute to how you survived, what you learned and how it shaped you as a person to your later life, you know as, as you look back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">A: Well when I came here you know, I, I ,as I said I came without any means and I tried to make something on me.</span> <span id="s1122">And I suppose I’m ambitious.</span> <span id="s1123">You know to, to and I wanted to achieve something you know.</span> <span id="s1124">And I was, I think in my estimation I was successful.</span> <span id="s1125">I didn’t become rich.</span> <span id="s1126">Money doesn’t matter so much you know but, but I am comfortable and, and I think that ambition you know is and, and I saw that.</span> <span id="s1127">I had the knowledge to do it.</span> <span id="s1128">And here I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">Q: Did it make you stronger.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">A: I think so yes.</span> <span id="s1131">Well you know of course you know the whole world is not perfect and not everybody is perfect.</span> <span id="s1132">There are things you know which I don’t’ agree with you know and but in, in general you know I try to be live my life, lead my life you know as, as well as I can.</span> <span id="s1133">But I tell you that, I, I think although I was not very religious, I lost my faith.</span> <span id="s1134">And I, it is I think due to, to Auschwitz in part, although I wasn’t very religious before that.</span> <span id="s1135">But I don’t’ think there was a god in Auschwitz or anywhere.</span> <span id="s1136">I don’t’ believe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">You know no matter how much you pray the more it doesn’t mean anything so just, just don’t have to face.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">Q: You still don’t believe that there is god.</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">A: I really don’t think so no, no.</span> <span id="s1140">I mean maybe there is some being or something you know but as far as I am concerned, no.</span> <span id="s1141">I mean I don’t’ look, I respect everybody’s religion, everybody’s beliefs but to me I don’t, I just don’t have any faith.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">Q: Do you think this would happen again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">A: I suppose so.</span> <span id="s1144">I think in the if the conditions are you know very, sometimes I forgot the words I want to, getting senile.</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">If the conditions are right I think that look the conditions for Hitler to get to power were right at that time.</span> <span id="s1146">you know they were the economical situation you know and so on.</span> <span id="s1147">and of course everything was.</span> <span id="s1148">If all the conditions are you know in place, it, it can happen, it can happen.</span> <span id="s1149">Look the we all not so long ago you know if you take Bosnia which is probably to a much smaller extent but there was still cleansing, you know killing and so on.</span> <span id="s1150">There, there is hatred between the religious hatred you know between the Muslims and the Christians and the, and the Orthodox people you know in Bosnia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">Yeah, Herzegovina.</span> <span id="s1152">And they, they are killing not to the extent as you know because it was in Hitler Germany it was organized you know and it was I think everything written out you know, how to do it and maybe in Bosnia it was spontaneous or not.</span> <span id="s1153">I don’t know but it still happened and it can happen.</span> <span id="s1154">Look at the killings in, in Africa .</span> <span id="s1155">you know we have.</span> <span id="s1156">And, and I think it can happen any, anywhere, anyway if the conditions are right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">Q: Do you ever wonder why you survived and what your purpose is?</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">A: Well I, I think I survived first because I wanted to.</span> <span id="s1159">And secondly I think I was lucky.</span> <span id="s1160">And I used my brains or you know my abilities the right way.</span> <span id="s1161">And that was the reason I, I did survive.</span> <span id="s1162">And the will to, to live.</span> <span id="s1163">The will to live.</span> <span id="s1164">It’s a very you know the instinct to survive is very strong in human beings.</span> <span id="s1165">And if you lose this, if you lose your will to live, you know then you are finished.</span> <span id="s1166">Might as well lie down and many did you know, many people in Auschwitz did.</span> <span id="s1167">Lose the will.</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">Of course it’s brought on by, by mistreatment, by hunger.</span> <span id="s1169">You know specially by hard labor.</span> <span id="s1170">But you know I think it’s also a lot of luck to do with it.</span> <span id="s1171">You know if you’re lucky and know and help you know strength you know, help each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">Q: Who helped you, actually let me ask you, your purpose, your purpose</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">A: My purpose.</span> <span id="s1174">Well, well I think the purpose is that you, you want to you know to be alive.</span> <span id="s1175">you want to, to live and see don’t’ want to be dead you know, that’s a purpose.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">Q: Even now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">A: Oh well, now, now my purpose well I just want to have you know a quiet and comfortable life you know.</span> <span id="s1178">And health.</span> <span id="s1179">You know in older, it’s all important this health you know.</span> <span id="s1180">Of course you know even it all depends on the genes you know which you were born.</span> <span id="s1181">Some people are, live longer, others shorter you know and I think I my father when he was he died, he was 90, almost 94.</span> <span id="s1182">93.</span> <span id="s1183">And he, he you know he died because he fell, fell and hit his head and probably could have lived longer.</span> <span id="s1184">My mother died because after operation she had an operation and she died there when she was 79.</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">So now the purpose and the purpose is also I want to say and that’s why I speak to the youth, you know in the high schools and the at college you know the, I want people to know what it was.</span> <span id="s1186">Maybe it, it may be in this way it can be prevented in the future.</span> <span id="s1187">For anything like this to happen again.</span> <span id="s1188">That, that’s the purpose.</span> <span id="s1189">And as I said I couldn’t’ talk about it and I wouldn’t talk about it, but now I do and I realize that you know that’s why I also wrote my memoirs because I wanted to put it in writing what happened.</span> <span id="s1190">I didn’t write everything and didn’t’ see everything.</span> <span id="s1191">You know there were things and other prisoners probably saw more, more of the horrors you know than I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">But I saw a few of them and believe me it is enough.</span> <span id="s1193">What I saw for any human being to see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">Q: You said you didn’t talk about it much before but you obviously kept in touch with friends that you could talk to about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">A: Yes, no I, I did, really didn’t keep too much in touch with friends.</span> <span id="s1196">I, I didn’t, I did meet one friend in London, it’s a girl.</span> <span id="s1197">(phone ringing)</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">Q: We were talking about your friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">A: I met in a friend while I was still in London so it was before I emigrated to the States.</span> <span id="s1200">It was in 51.</span> <span id="s1201">I met her.</span> <span id="s1202">She is a Jewish Polish Jewish girl and she worked in a typing pool, next to my office when I worked in, I worked in the central building administration building.</span> <span id="s1203">And she was in the typing pool.</span> <span id="s1204">There were approximately ten, ten Jewish girls.</span> <span id="s1205">She was the only Polish girl.</span> <span id="s1206">There were Slovakian girls, Hungarian girls, and one Dutch girl.</span> <span id="s1207">I think one German girl and there were altogether ten and they all spoke both, their own language and German and they could take shorthand you know in German.</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">And, and I met her.</span> <span id="s1209">They all survived.</span> <span id="s1210">They were all Jewish.</span> <span id="s1211">They all survived.</span> <span id="s1212">They were evacuated from, from Auschwitz and I know from her because I met her in London, she told me that they all survived.</span> <span id="s1213">And so I keep in touch, I still do keep in touch with her.</span> <span id="s1214">You know once in a while I call her or she writes to me and when I am in London I see her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">Q: When you first met your wife was it very difficult to talk to her about the war or did you do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">A: I did, but I didn’t go into details.</span> <span id="s1217">I just told her that I was in Auschwitz you know and no I didn’t go into details.</span> <span id="s1218">No, until later.</span> <span id="s1219">I.</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">Q: How later, how much later?</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">A: Oh I you know I really to talk about it when I started writing the memoirs you know and it was probably seven years ago, seven years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">Q: Is it hard to keep it locked up that for so long.</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">A: No you know because I was busy.</span> <span id="s1224">I concentrated on my work and I didn’t.</span> <span id="s1225">I just put it, I think in this respect I have the ability to do to put it aside you know and I think that’s what kept me sane ,that I have this ability to push it out of my mind.</span> <span id="s1226">You know, now I can recall it.</span> <span id="s1227">Now you know that I am more comfortable you know with it, I can recall it.</span> <span id="s1228">And it doesn’t’ hurt as, although I, as I told you before, I sometimes have nightmares when I talk too much about it.</span> <span id="s1229">Probably will have one tonight.</span> <span id="s1230">Don’t worry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">Q: I’m sorry to hear that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">A: Well you know I mean you can’t avoid it.</span> <span id="s1233">You can’t avoid it when you start talking about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">Now you know the worst part in Auschwitz to me anyway was the uncertainty which, under which we lived.</span> <span id="s1235">You know although I did work you know.</span> <span id="s1236">I had a job.</span> <span id="s1237">You know I worked in an office afterwards and I was not mistreated, although I didn’t have any more food but I, I had an easy, easy work.</span> <span id="s1238">But the, the uncertainty of life.</span> <span id="s1239">You, you know although, although you work in the office, when you came to the compound you didn’t’ know what to expect.</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">You didn’t know whether they are not going to call your name and take you, you know to the desk block and they you know and shoot you or hang you or gas you, you know.</span> <span id="s1241">I, I think in my transcript I did say that I, I was lucky to escape gassing only by, by a few hours you know.</span> <span id="s1242">So, so you see that that was the un, then what prompted us also to escape was that we knew that the, the end of the camp was nearing because the front was you know we had good information because we had the r, radios.</span> <span id="s1243">I worked in the workshops you know and there were electricians who always got the radios for repair.</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">And they of course when they, once they repaired the radio they kept it and they tuned in, into the BBC you know and so on.</span> <span id="s1245">So we, we had the information and we know that and we also knew that there was a plan to destroy the camp you know the evidence you know.</span> <span id="s1246">It was called Mole plan.</span> <span id="s1247">Mole was a, a German staff sergeant you know in the SS oberhauptshungfere or something that is.</span> <span id="s1248">And he had the plan to destroy it you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">And he wanted some planes and tanks and so on and level everything but of course the, you know the war effort wouldn’t permit the Germans to you know given all these things to do the job.</span> <span id="s1250">But we knew it about it and that’s why we also escaped because we didn’t know what’s going to happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">Now maybe somebody can say it was selfish but I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1252">If it was selfish.</span> <span id="s1253">But it was pre, you know self-preservation.</span> <span id="s1254">I wanted to live.</span> <span id="s1255">And you know you couldn’t save the whole camp.</span> <span id="s1256">The whole camp couldn’t’ escape.</span> <span id="s1257">Although when we went to the partisans we thought that maybe we will be able to liberate the camp, but we had you know there were a hundred of us and we were poorly armed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">We, we wouldn’t’ have any chance you know to do anything like that.</span> <span id="s1259">it was impossible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">Q: Six or seven years ago you started writing your memoirs and talking to people about this.</span> <span id="s1261">what was there anything particularly that happened that cause you to want to do this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">A: Well actually the, the urging of some of my friends.</span> <span id="s1263">American friends, none of the friends who were in concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1264">None of them, no but when I when I spoke with them you know and they knew that I was in the concentration camp then they said well you should write it.</span> <span id="s1265">you should put it on, on paper.</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">Q: You were starting to speak at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">A: Oh yes well</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">Q: What urged you to speak.</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">A: Well not to speak you know where I didn’t go in details.</span> <span id="s1270">I just told them that I was a member.</span> <span id="s1271">And then they said well why don’t you write your experiences you know.</span> <span id="s1272">So that, that’s when it happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">Q: Why did you come to the US?</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">A: That’s a good question.</span> <span id="s1275">I, I really you know I really didn’t think that I would come so fast you know.</span> <span id="s1276">you know when I put my name in the, I really didn’t.</span> <span id="s1277">But although I was not very happy in England.</span> <span id="s1278">You know.</span> <span id="s1279">I, I really didn’t, dint’ know whether I wanted to go to the United States and my friend you know urged, urged me you know to put my name.</span> <span id="s1280">I put and you know within I think 3 months I was here.</span> <span id="s1281">But not that I regret.</span> <span id="s1282">I never did.</span> <span id="s1283">I was very unhappy at the beginning.</span> <span id="s1284">I was unhappy and because I was lonely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">But, but now I think it’s you know now that I know the United States and I know it from the east to the west you know the south and north I think it’s a great country.</span> <span id="s1286">And I wouldn’t want to live anywhere else.</span> <span id="s1287">And especially here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">Q: How did you end up in Ashland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">A: Well a friend of mine well first of all I was retiring.</span> <span id="s1290">I wanted to retire and to we wanted to retire in you know most of New Yorkers go to Florida.</span> <span id="s1291">Well we went to Florida.</span> <span id="s1292">And I, I can’t stand the climate.</span> <span id="s1293">You know it’s very hot.</span> <span id="s1294">And very humid.</span> <span id="s1295">Then we thought about North Carolina.</span> <span id="s1296">The same, hot and humid.</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">Then we went to Arizona.</span> <span id="s1298">Now there it’s hot.</span> <span id="s1299">It was so hot I said no we can’t stand here.</span> <span id="s1300">Then we went to San Diego and there was quite expensive to live there.</span> <span id="s1301">You know.</span> <span id="s1302">and then this fellow, friend of mine suggested you know why don’t you go to Ashland, Oregon.</span> <span id="s1303">He said I was there and you know and he had also a friend there in real estate broker.</span> <span id="s1304">So we came here.</span> <span id="s1305">We came for four days.</span> <span id="s1306">You know matter of fact we drove from San Diego here.</span> <span id="s1307">You know, I rented a car.</span> <span id="s1308">We came here.</span> <span id="s1309">We stayed four days.</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">And the fellow started showing us a, houses.</span> <span id="s1311">And then he showed us, this was the last house he showed us.</span> <span id="s1312">And it was almost new.</span> <span id="s1313">It was only a year old.</span> <span id="s1314">This house.</span> <span id="s1315">And I like, I liked the view and everything and we bought the house.</span> <span id="s1316">And then we went back.</span> <span id="s1317">We came from Connecticut actually.</span> <span id="s1318">Stamford, Connecticut.</span> <span id="s1319">We went back to Connecticut.</span> <span id="s1320">I sold our house there.</span> <span id="s1321">and in 85 we moved here.</span> <span id="s1322">And, and May 31st we came here, May 31st in 85.</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">So I didn’t regret it.</span> <span id="s1324">Well Frieda is, Frieda is used to big cities.</span> <span id="s1325">I had a consulting job while here.</span> <span id="s1326">We had in San Francisco.</span> <span id="s1327">We stayed for 3 months in San Francisco.</span> <span id="s1328">But now I like it.</span> <span id="s1329">of course it is far you know.</span> <span id="s1330">if you want to go to Europe, we, we have to go from Medford to San Francisco, to Portland and then fly take the flight you know from the but it is, it is very comfortable.</span> <span id="s1331">Nice, nice home, nice house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">Q: This is the last question.</span> <span id="s1333">Looking back on your life, looking back on your life what do you think was, this is a really tough question but what does it all mean to you , looking back on your life.</span> <span id="s1334">What is your I guess your greatest sense of pride, how about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">A: Well I, I tell you the greatest sense of pride is that I was able to escape from Auschwitz you know.</span> <span id="s1336">To, yeah.</span> <span id="s1337">I, because it was an achievement which not many people could live, you know live up to.</span> <span id="s1338">You know.</span> <span id="s1339">It, it was a great decision .</span> <span id="s1340">because I knew I was playing with my life and maybe I didn’t realize it then but you know the more I come to think of you know it, it was a really great undertaking you know that.</span> <span id="s1341">You know that, because so many things could have gone wrong.</span> <span id="s1342">You know and I could have been dead but I, I did it and it required a great courage.</span> <span id="s1343">And I am proud of it.</span> <span id="s1344">That I did.</span> <span id="s1345">That I you know that I was able to outwit, outwit the Germans and that I despite you know their cruelty and the and I was able to do it.</span> <span id="s1346">And that I am proud of.</span> <span id="s1347">That I was successful and I was able to defeat you know the German system.</span> <span id="s1348">That I am proud of.</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">Q: You mentioned your survival skills and luck but one thing you just mentioned is your wit.</span> <span id="s1350">You kept your wits about you, your intelligence.</span> <span id="s1351">How did that help you ?</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">A: Oh yes, well you know I mean you know the planning of the escape you know took many you can talk about it or write about it you know in a few words or a few sentences you know, but it took a long time to prepare for it and, and during all the preparation you know anything could have gone wrong.</span> <span id="s1353">You had to know to whom to trust and who not to trust.</span> <span id="s1354">And you know because there could have been an informer who would, although we were, we more or less knew each other you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">What we dealt with you know and could trust but so it required a lot of preparation, a lot of, of thinking and a lot of cunning you know to get it all done.</span> <span id="s1356">And a lot of trust.</span> <span id="s1357">We had to put in other people because you couldn’t do it all by on your own.</span> <span id="s1358">So that I, I am, I am proud of that, that I was able to do it.</span> <span id="s1359">Of course I am proud of the other fellows you know who went with us, who helped us and we all stuck together and we were able to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">Q: How long of a time period was that?</span> <span id="s1361">How long did it take you to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">A: I, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1363">But probably half a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">Q: There were other instances in your time at Auschwitz and actually before and after where it really took a craftiness you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">A: Yeah that’s right.</span> <span id="s1366">There were not many escapes.</span> <span id="s1367">Well</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">Q: I mean just in your life though that there was a craftiness or a sense of knowing when’s the right moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">A: Yes that’s right.</span> <span id="s1370">Now maybe you know this was a result of the war.</span> <span id="s1371">You know we hated the Germans.</span> <span id="s1372">And whenever we could hurt them you know we tried to hurt them.</span> <span id="s1373">And, and you had to be cunning and crafty you know to, to cheat you know.</span> <span id="s1374">To, to do anything you know to not to help them you know succeed.</span> <span id="s1375">So this of course was during the occupation you know, when I lived in Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">And later on you know it carried through into the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1377">You know where you also tried you know to do everything you know to not to help the Germans, you know to prevent them from succeeding.</span> <span id="s1378">And of course it was only in a very small way but still that’s what one tried to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">And we were all united in it.</span> <span id="s1380">And that, that was the best part of it, that people were united you know because we had a common enemy and we stuck together and later on as I said when the Communists came to power, you know it changed.</span> <span id="s1381">And then people started not trusting each other you know because you never knew who you talked to, whether he was a Communist you know supporter of the government or antigovernment you know person you didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">And that divided the people I mean in Poland anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">Q: Is there anything else you want to say?</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">A: No I just want to thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">Q: Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">(end)</span></p></body></html>
