Snyderman (Alex, you've been telling me about your roots, and it seems that your father was born in Irkutsk, Siberia, where there was a large Jewish population, and your mother was born in Moscow.</span> <span id="s16">You were going to tell me a bit about why your father happened to be in Irkutsk.</span> <span id="s17">Something happened under the czar where the family wound up there.)</span> <span id="s18">Actually I do not know much about my grandfather's family, but I recall the story about my grandmother's family.</span> <span id="s19">Her grandfather was a tailor in the Ukraine, and he wasn't a revolutionary person, but I was told the story that some students used to gather in his house and read books and discuss things and talk about politics, maybe, and because of this he was resettled from the Ukraine to Siberia by the czar regime.</span> <span id="s20">He was resettled and from that time on, they lived in Siberia in a small settlement near the river Pilivda, as I remember.</span> <span id="s21">And there were many Jews who had been resettled from the Ukraine to Siberia and started the Russian Jewish population in Siberia.</span> <span id="s22">And now in America from time to time I meet people from Siberia.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">(Do you think you get a different type of person from Siberia than you do from other parts of Russia?)</span> <span id="s24">A little bit, but not strongly.</span> <span id="s25">(How are they different?)</span> <span id="s26">You see, of course the environment impacts on the person, and maybe they are more closed persons.</span> <span id="s27">They do not talk much.</span> <span id="s28">But I do not see a very strong difference.</span> <span id="s29">They are pretty close to us who lived in Moscow and so on, of course in the central part of Russia, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">(Now I'm going to ask you what your earliest memories are growing up in Moscow.</span> <span id="s31">Tell me who lived in your house, what your neighborhood was like, what do you remember of school.)</span> <span id="s32">This is a tough question because I don't know how to answer.</span> <span id="s33">If you are interested in my Jewish remembrance, for instance, I don't know... (That's a good start...) This is something exact, something that I can talk about a little bit.</span> <span id="s34">This is something absolutely different in Russia than in America.</span> <span id="s35">In America as I can see now, as I can realize, kids recognize themselves as Jews from the very beginning, let's say from the date of birth, from very young.</span> <span id="s36">But in Russia, the story was absolutely different.</span> <span id="s37">And as I recall, I didn't recognize myself as a Jew until I was fifteen, fourteen years old.</span> <span id="s38">You see, there are often, I heard this word to my address Jew and my impressions were not very good, but I can say that I simply didn't understand what it is.</span> <span id="s39">I didn't understand why kids called me a Jew and why it was bad.</span> <span id="s40">And in Russian there are several words, several terms to call a Jew, and they are not like a nickname.</span> <span id="s41">They are almost like a bad word.</span> <span id="s42">And I didn't understand those until I was fourteen.</span> <span id="s43">And by that time, step by step, I got friends and many of my friends were Jews too, and from that moment on, I started to understand something that I belonged to the Jewish nationality, that I belonged to a very, very old people, to the part of the world community with a very old and rich history.</span> <span id="s44">At that time, probably, when I was a teen, I was interested, as I remember, very much in history, in all things that were available in Russia.</span> <span id="s45">Not many of them were at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">And then step by step I do not remember the first time when I appeared in the Moscow Synagogue by the way, a very interesting place.</span> <span id="s47">It's a very old synagogue maybe two hundred years, maybe a little less, I don't know very old, very beautiful, with all details, as I realize now special details that helped to serve the religion in this, let's say, difficult environment.</span> <span id="s48">For many years, Russia was trying to kill all religions, and especially first of all Jewish religion.</span> <span id="s49">I don't know how many synagogues were in Russia until the last year.</span> <span id="s50">And then we started to visit the synagogue during big holidays like Passover, like Rosh Hashona, like Simchat Torah.</span> <span id="s51">(How old were you?)</span> <span id="s52">I was sixteen, maybe seventeen.</span> <span id="s53">You see, when you get this piece of information, and somehow I realized that this is my part.</span> <span id="s54">This is something that I can say that I like, that I felt good with and so on, that I understood.</span> <span id="s55">We used to meet friends near the synagogue and so on.</span> <span id="s56">And from that time period, of course things were different.</span> <span id="s57">This part of my life When I realized I was a Jew became absolutely different.</span> <span id="s58">I was proud, and I am proud of this.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">(I'm wondering what made your family take you to the synagogue then and not before.</span> <span id="s60">What changed?</span> <span id="s61">What kind of changes were going on around you that permitted that?)</span> <span id="s62">That's a good question.</span> <span id="s63">You see, I can't say that it was my family that brought me to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s64">Probably it was my friends, and probably it was myself.</span> <span id="s65">I'm not sure that I really can explain all details even for myself right now.</span> <span id="s66">In Russia, it was a custom to think it was part of the education of kids that there isn't anything like a religion.</span> <span id="s67">It shouldn't be.</span> <span id="s68">The greatest idea is everything that deals with the Communist idea all people should be Communists, and they should be the same and the most important thing is to belong to the working class... and religious affiliation...</span></p> <p><span id="s69">(Anything that was organized religion was outlawed.)</span> <span id="s70">Right.</span> <span id="s71">And it was something wrong and didn't prohibit it.</span> <span id="s72">I recall the story when one man got time only for teaching Hebrew.</span> <span id="s73">I'm not sure if I explained the story exactly.</span> <span id="s74">He was a teacher.</span> <span id="s75">He had a group of people who studied the Hebrew alphabet, words, trying to understand the Torah not Torah but Bible written in Hebrew and he got the time only for teaching, not for religion, not for some kind of wrong things from the point of view of government, but only for teaching Hebrew.</span> <span id="s76">Just teaching the language.</span> <span id="s77">(For beginners...) Right, at the beginning level.</span> <span id="s78">I'm absolutely sure that people who gathered and tried to study Hebrew they didn't have any kind of advanced level, of course.</span> <span id="s79">For instance, in Russia I didn't know the Hebrew alphabet at all only some letters.</span> <span id="s80">Again, he got time only for teaching.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">(You mean he got sent to prison?)</span> <span id="s82">Yes!</span> <span id="s83">(Where was he sent to prison?)</span> <span id="s84">In Moscow or in Leningrad.</span> <span id="s85">I do not remember the story exactly because it was... (How old a man was he?)</span> <span id="s86">He was young probably he was forty years old.</span> <span id="s87">(And what year was that about?)</span> <span id="s88">In the 1970s.</span> <span id="s89">(How long was he in prison?)</span> <span id="s90">These details I do not know because he wasn't a friend of mine.</span> <span id="s91">(He was the friend of a friend?)</span> <span id="s92">No, just someone that I heard a story about.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">(So the authorities were pretty strict at that point, but that was before you had the opportunity to go to synagogue, because it wasn't so dangerous then.</span> <span id="s94">You were born in 1952 you were sixteen or seventeen, so it would have been in the late Sixties, around '69.)</span> <span id="s95">It was approximately at this period of time.</span> <span id="s96">(He was sent to prison about the same time you were going to synagogue?)</span> <span id="s97">At the same time, we started to visit synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">(Would you say this was an act of foolhardiness on your part?</span> <span id="s99">Were you taking a big risk doing this, or was it reasonably safe to do this?)</span> <span id="s100">By the way, not always.</span> <span id="s101">I know stories about guys whom I knew who were expelled from the institute because of visiting synagogue.</span> <span id="s102">These stories I know for sure.</span> <span id="s103">And the story that happened with me...</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Once during the holiday it was the beginning of the fall maybe it was Rosh Hashona or Yom Kippur I do not remember exactly we were at the synagogue.</span> <span id="s105">The regular story, we were singing and talking with friends, and then one guy appeared who was taking pictures of us with the camera and flash and all that stuff and he took some pictures and after that, I realized that some of the pictures appeared at the institute where I studied, for instance.</span> <span id="s106">I don't remember if my picture was over there, but it was a very funny story, and we, being students, were telling this story to each other which photographs appeared and who was questioned about this thing of visiting the synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">(Where did the photographs appear in a publication?)</span> <span id="s108">The pictures appeared at first in the Party Committee of the institute.</span> <span id="s109">Each governmental institute in Russia probably I have to add that all enterprises and institutes they are all in a sense of governmental origin.</span> <span id="s110">They are governed by the government.</span> <span id="s111">And they do have special party committee.</span> <span id="s112">I am sure that this is something boring to listen about this, because it is very stupid how it could be, that everything could be governed from a certain place, but in Russia these are the things that are customary.</span> <span id="s113">And the first pictures appeared in this Party Committee, and then they were distributed to the departments people belonged to, and so on.</span> <span id="s114">I remember another story when people were expelled.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">(Let me ask you, where did you go to school?</span> <span id="s116">You went to school in Irkutsk as a small child, and then when you finished our equivalent of high school you would have been sixteen or seventeen?)</span> <span id="s117">Seventeen.</span> <span id="s118">(Did you know early on what you wanted to do?</span> <span id="s119">Did you know what your career would be?)</span> <span id="s120">Of course, I didn't know for sure.</span> <span id="s121">But to some extent, my attitude to the future has been formed during the last couple of years after high school.</span> <span id="s122">And I understood that things of great interest to me are physics and math, and I wanted to follow this track, this way.</span> <span id="s123">I passed exams I was very lucky I passed exams and entered a very good institution in Russia.</span> <span id="s124">I'd like to add that science and everything dealing with this in Russia this is an absolutely different story than very many tough and stupid things that can happen in Russia still, they had good institution and a not very bad system of education, and if you would be lucky, you could get not bad education in Russia.</span> <span id="s125">But of course, Jews had restrictions; they had very strong barriers, and everybody knew that.</span> <span id="s126">To some extent it wasn't a secret that Jews were treated absolutely different at the institute during the examinations.</span> <span id="s127">Being a Jew, you had simply different marks.</span> <span id="s128">If you got the same marks as a Russian or a guy of different nationality, minority, could get in this place.</span> <span id="s129">And Jews, they were not minorities like minorities in America, absolutely.</span> <span id="s130">They were treated differently.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">(They were discriminated against.)</span> <span id="s132">[laughing] Yes!</span> <span id="s133">It's a bit funny to recall and to talk about it, but when you live under this system, when this is not the story that you are talking about but when it's your life you see!</span> <span id="s134">When you are thinking about this... I don't want to say all day long, but very often... this is something...</span></p> <p><span id="s135">(So you felt some anxiety about your future because your interest was in physics and mathematics and you know that you're probably a pretty good student, right?)</span> <span id="s136">Right!</span> <span id="s137">I tried to be.</span> <span id="s138">I studied with interest.</span> <span id="s139">(So when you finished, what were your grades?)</span> <span id="s140">Yeah.</span> <span id="s141">Actually, I got my first degree in Physics.</span> <span id="s142">My grades were, in Russia, the system of education is a little bit different.</span> <span id="s143">I do not remember exactly all my grades.</span> <span id="s144">In general, they were not bad.</span> <span id="s145">(So this is when you're already at the institute?)</span> <span id="s146">Yes.</span> <span id="s147">(What's the name of the institute?)</span> <span id="s148">It was the Physical Technical Institute of Moscow.</span> <span id="s149">(Were you worried about getting into this institute?)</span> <span id="s150">Yes, I was, sure.</span> <span id="s151">(So your grades had to have been pretty good at your regular school prior to that, right?)</span> <span id="s152">Yes.</span> <span id="s153">Oh, you're talking about my grades from high school?</span> <span id="s154">(Yes.)</span> <span id="s155">Oh, my high school diploma was very good.</span> <span id="s156">Probably if I had any Cs it was a mark about my behavior.</span> <span id="s157">In Russia, teachers estimate not only your knowledge, but your behavior.</span> <span id="s158">(And your telling me you misbehaved in class?)</span> <span id="s159">Yeah.</span> <span id="s160">Probably, it could be.</span> <span id="s161">I'm also sure that teachers do not like me very much very often.</span> <span id="s162">I'm talking about the teacher in History.</span> <span id="s163">We had very tough discussions.</span> <span id="s164">It's very interesting.</span> <span id="s165">We didn't know the truth at that time, not many materials and books and studies had been published at that time.</span> <span id="s166">We didn't know the truth.</span> <span id="s167">But we felt, being even kids and having sources sometimes from the radio... By the way, I recall many stories we had by the radio from America.</span> <span id="s168">(Voice of America?)</span> <span id="s169">Right.</span> <span id="s170">And sometimes kids could find something in all the books and stories of their grandparents, and so on, but we felt that the type of history that teachers at the school tried to bring to the class was wrong.</span> <span id="s171">It wasn't the truth.</span> <span id="s172">(So you actually challenged the teacher?)</span> <span id="s173">Yeah.</span> <span id="s174">But I got a very bad story after this.</span> <span id="s175">Yes!</span> <span id="s176">I could be called so, yeah.</span> <span id="s177">(You weren't afraid?)</span> <span id="s178">I don't know.</span> <span id="s179">Yes, I was, I was.</span> <span id="s180">(So why did you do it?)</span> <span id="s181">Because we felt and knew that she was not right.</span> <span id="s182">That it wasn't true.</span> <span id="s183">At that time we thought that probably something could be changed.</span> <span id="s184">Later on, when we became older, we understood that probably to change things isn't in our power, you see.</span> <span id="s185">And probably at that time we became much more pragmatic.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">(When you say "we", you're talking about other people in your class?)</span> <span id="s187">Right, about my friends, yes.</span> <span id="s188">(How many of you were doing this?)</span> <span id="s189">Like, five people.</span> <span id="s190">I'm not going to say that all of us were doing things, but we were friends and we were exchanging opinions and stories and were discussing all things.</span> <span id="s191">We were of the same point of view about things that happened.</span> <span id="s192">By the way, I'm talking about the last two years of high school.</span> <span id="s193">At that time, we had a very good, very close group of five, six Jewish guys (all boys?)</span> <span id="s194">yes.</span> <span id="s195">Yes.</span> <span id="s196">You see, all of them were boys.</span> <span id="s197">(These boys went to the synagogue together?)</span> <span id="s198">Yes.</span> <span id="s199">We used to go to the synagogue together.</span> <span id="s200">Of course the stories and our histories are different, but at least three guys, three people are now in America.</span> <span id="s201">Two in America and one in Canada.</span> <span id="s202">And probably that was the beginning of my Jewish recognition, if I'm explaining it correctly.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">(Let me backtrack a little.</span> <span id="s204">I see the influence of this peer group.</span> <span id="s205">But you say that your grandmother, Faina, lived with you.)</span> <span id="s206">Yes.</span> <span id="s207">(And she knew some Yiddish.</span> <span id="s208">She was a gynecologist.)</span> <span id="s209">Yes.</span> <span id="s210">(Was she practicing medicine when you were a child?)</span> <span id="s211">Yeah, but again, I'm sorry, but probably I will repeat this sentence very often, that in Russia, the way it goes is different from American.</span> <span id="s212">Again, practicing of medicine in Russia is different.</span> <span id="s213">She didn't have a private practice as physicians do in America.</span> <span id="s214">But she belonged to the very big clinic, again of a governmental department.</span> <span id="s215">Everything in Russia belonged, (and this is a problem right now to destroy this system and to get more freedom), even a couple of years ago even four, five years ago it belonged to the government.</span> <span id="s216">Anyway, at the clinic she had a very big practice.</span> <span id="s217">She was famous.</span> <span id="s218">She worked for fifty years.</span> <span id="s219">So, yes, I remember.</span> <span id="s220">(So you're saying she worked almost until she died?)</span> <span id="s221">Yes, exactly.</span> <span id="s222">She retired a year before her death.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">(She would have a recollection of Jewish practices and knowing Yiddish and so forth.</span> <span id="s224">Did anything appear in the household because of this background, even foods.</span> <span id="s225">Do you remember any foods that were Jewish that you could look at now and say...) Yeah, I can.</span> <span id="s226">My grandmother and my mother they saved many Jewish recipes.</span> <span id="s227">And I recall special names, like: knadel, like kugola, like .... (There was challah in the house, that special twisted bread?)</span> <span id="s228">I will try to answer.</span> <span id="s229">You see, it was very strange, but at that time and probably until recently, you could buy challah at the special bread store.</span> <span id="s230">Again, in Russia, this system is absolutely different, I mean stores and markets they are different.</span> <span id="s231">There are special stores for bread.</span> <span id="s232">At this store you could buy real challah.</span> <span id="s233">At first, a long time ago, it was called challah, exactly.</span> <span id="s234">Then, of course, it lost this name and was called bread 25 kopeks.</span> <span id="s235">Now that I can compare with real Jewish challah, it looked exactly like... it really was a Jewish challah.</span> <span id="s236">(But there was no Shabbat service?)</span> <span id="s237">Of course not.</span> <span id="s238">It wasn't kosher.</span> <span id="s239">(It didn't just appear on Friday nights?)</span> <span id="s240">No, it didn't appear.</span> <span id="s241">This bread wasn't connected with the Shabbat.</span> <span id="s242">Not at all.</span> <span id="s243">I remember not far from the very beginning, because matzoh was in our house from being a kid, and my mother and my grandmother my mother's mother she used to bring, and used to cook things from matzoh.</span> <span id="s244">Matzoh this is the name, the word I'll remember forever.</span> <span id="s245">And last years in Russia, I was responsible to bring and to buy matzoh and to bring it home.</span> <span id="s246">What's the way to get matzoh in Moscow?</span> <span id="s247">Probably the same stories in big Russian cities.</span> <span id="s248">Maybe the story is different in small villages, in small Jewish settlements and so on, but in Moscow you could buy matzoh in the synagogue.</span> <span id="s249">There is only one synagogue in Moscow.</span> <span id="s250">Like 200,000 Jews in Moscow, not less, maybe 100,000, but of this order 100,000 Jews in one city and one synagogue.</span> <span id="s251">[laughs] They prepared matzoh only for the Passover.</span> <span id="s252">(How many years was this going on?)</span> <span id="s253">Forever.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">(I've heard different stories about the unavailability of matzoh in different cities.</span> <span id="s255">Like in Odessa they couldn't get matzoh.</span> <span id="s256">But you're saying that in Moscow all along, it was possible.)</span> <span id="s257">Yes, it was possible, but it wasn't a very simple way, because very many Jews wanted to buy, and only one place, only one small window through which you could get this matzoh, and it wasn't very simple.</span> <span id="s258">And I believe it was the story that in some big cities you couldn't get matzoh at all.</span> <span id="s259">Anyway, it wasn't something simple, something regular.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">(Let's jump to.</span> <span id="s261">.</span> <span id="s262">now you're a student at the institute.</span> <span id="s263">Are you involved in political activities at the institute?)</span> <span id="s264">No.</span> <span id="s265">(Now you're careful.)</span> <span id="s266">Right, exactly.</span> <span id="s267">(In your classes, is it generally known by your instructors that you're Jewish?)</span> <span id="s268">Probably not.</span> <span id="s269">At the first institute... Let me tell the story to the very end.</span> <span id="s270">The first degree I got from the Physical Institute and the Master's degree I got from a different institute.</span> <span id="s271">It was in Moscow, too.</span> <span id="s272">It was called the Institute of Transportation.</span> <span id="s273">By the way, the title doesn't mean anything.</span> <span id="s274">It could be a very interesting department, very interesting people, and so on, at any institute.</span> <span id="s275">Later on I'll try to tell the story of this institute, too.</span> <span id="s276">At first, when I started at the Physical Institute, instructors were really nice people, and they were not worried about these things.</span> <span id="s277">This is not... This is from 1969 to 1973, early '70s.</span> <span id="s278">At first what we were worried about was physics, math and absolutely regular things that are almost the same as in America.</span> <span id="s279">And you could understand that there are some restrictions, some things that you couldn't get, only dealing again with the special, how to explain, with the authorities of the institute.</span> <span id="s280">Of course, it's an institute and there are authorities.</span> <span id="s281">And authorities, you see, you had to deal with them.</span> <span id="s282">And this process is with some kind of separation.</span> <span id="s283">The life for Jews, it's like a way with barriers.</span> <span id="s284">If you got through the barrier, then things are quiet and more or less good.</span> <span id="s285">You can live, you can do probably what you are thinking about, but to get through this barrier and this barrier is different for you and for different people.</span> <span id="s286">And if you got through this barrier, for several years you could be safe, you could think, you could do something.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">(But you didn't tell me what the barrier was with you.)</span> <span id="s288">Right, the barrier was the entering exams.</span> <span id="s289">To enter the institute, you see, at this moment, you've been treated differently.</span> <span id="s290">To apply to the institute, you had to fill out the application, and in the application, it should be written your nationality.</span> <span id="s291">I don't know if you're familiar with this process, but in Russia, you live forever, you live your whole life with your nationality, because your nationality is written down in your passport.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">(What is the official name of this passport?</span> <span id="s293">Is this the internal passport?)</span> <span id="s294">Yes.</span> <span id="s295">Exactly.</span> <span id="s296">An internal passport.</span> <span id="s297">Passport of a citizen of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.</span> <span id="s298">And your nationality isn't your religious affiliation.</span> <span id="s299">This is something absolutely different.</span> <span id="s300">And I'm not sure that people in America really understand all these details exactly, but you are a Jew, and you've been treated differently independent of your religious attitude, of your opinion about religion.</span> <span id="s301">Maybe you do not like to think about religious history and so on, but you are a Jew from the very beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">(And it's different because... let's see if I'm right about this, because I've been hearing something about it and I want to understand.</span> <span id="s303">The other people who have this stamped on their passport it is a nationality like Russian...) Uzbek...(Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s304">But the Jews didn't come from one section of the country.</span> <span id="s305">They didn't have a part of the country, right.</span> <span id="s306">So I understand already this is a different kind of meaning even though it's in the same place on the passport.</span> <span id="s307">Is that right?</span> <span id="s308">It's in the same place as if you were Russian, but it isn't your birthplace at all.</span> <span id="s309">It's not the nation you come from....) Exactly.</span> <span id="s310">Right.</span> <span id="s311">This is the nation... (You're part of a national minority, but your minority, the Jewish national minority, does not have a place in this country.)</span> <span id="s312">Right, absolutely.</span> <span id="s313">We're trying to estimate this situation, and probably Jews were the only minority in Russia that didn't have the place.</span> <span id="s314">But again I'm not saying the truth exactly, because there is a special Jewish autonomous region in Russia, but this region is in the Far East probably you do not even know this place.</span> <span id="s315">It is quite close to Japan the so called Birobizhan region.</span> <span id="s316">But Jews never recognized this place as their region, as something that they belonged to.</span> <span id="s317">They came to Russia from an absolutely different place.</span> <span id="s318">They lived in different cities and different places, and they were settled over there by the order of Stalin and it was something.</span> <span id="s319">Anyway, Jews didn't have... (But that only came later, Birobizhan.)</span> <span id="s320">Sure, it came in the late '30s.</span> <span id="s321">(And then later on it even became a place for exiles, didn't it?</span> <span id="s322">And imprisonment for Jews?)</span> <span id="s323">Yeah, it could be.</span> <span id="s324">I do not know.</span> <span id="s325">It could be, but I'm not sure.</span> <span id="s326">(But it wasn't generally known.)</span> <span id="s327">(So there you were with your passport trying to get into the institute.</span> <span id="s328">That was the first barrier.)</span> <span id="s329">Yes.</span> <span id="s330">Let's say it was the first barrier on the life way of me and of all my friends.</span> <span id="s331">(Was this a shock for you?)</span> <span id="s332">No.</span> <span id="s333">We were prepared.</span> <span id="s334">You see, when you graduate from high school, you're already a big guy, and you had to be prepared for real life.</span> <span id="s335">And this is exactly, probably, the science that your parents teach you in.</span> <span id="s336">This is the story, all these things, this is the way it goes in Russia.</span> <span id="s337">Parents of a Jewish boy or girl they try to prepare the kid for the real life.</span> <span id="s338">They tell different stories... (In your house, who talked to you about this?)</span> <span id="s339">My mother and my dad, too.</span> <span id="s340">We talked and we discussed all these stories and situations candidly, and talked about everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">(I didn't ask you what your father and mother did.</span> <span id="s342">I know what your grandmother did...) My father's occupation was as an electrical engineer.</span> <span id="s343">(That was his work.)</span> <span id="s344">Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s345">(Mother?)</span> <span id="s346">She was a pediatrician.</span> <span id="s347">(And she worked like your grandmother at a clinic?)</span> <span id="s348">At the same clinic.</span> <span id="s349">My grandmother helped my mother to find a job.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">(So your parents were able to talk with you and prepare you.</span> <span id="s351">Did your plans for school change by the fact that you knew you were going to have some difficulties.</span> <span id="s352">For example, you had a doctor in your family, and it was hard to get into medical school.</span> <span id="s353">Did you have any thoughts yourself of becoming a doctor?)</span> <span id="s354">No.</span> <span id="s355">I didn't.</span> <span id="s356">(Did you go after what you really wanted to go after?)</span> <span id="s357">I tried.</span> <span id="s358">Sure, I tried.</span> <span id="s359">I realized that I could get problems and that probably I wouldn't be able to get everything that I would like to get, but I knew that I had to try at least.</span> <span id="s360">I was lucky.</span> <span id="s361">(They accepted you without a lot of problems?)</span> <span id="s362">Yes, I passed exams very good.</span> <span id="s363">And I remember at this institute only two Jewish guys and in our department we had 70, maybe 100 students, and among them I remember only two Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">(How big was the student population at the institute?)</span> <span id="s365">It was a very big institute, like 78 big departments.</span> <span id="s366">In Russia, to get the degree you have to study sometimes five years, maybe six years.</span> <span id="s367">Eight departments, maybe a hundred students in each.</span> <span id="s368">It's a big institute, and very much work has been done at this institute.</span> <span id="s369">It was a good school.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">(So you thought you had a good education, but you also knew that you were very much in the minority, and knew only two other Jews in your department...) Yeah, but I was not friends with the other Jewish guys.</span> <span id="s371">(So your friends were not Jewish, they were Russian?)</span> <span id="s372">No, no.</span> <span id="s373">My friends were from high school.</span> <span id="s374">And these are my real friends up to this day, to this moment.</span> <span id="s375">(But they weren't with you at this institute?)</span> <span id="s376">No, they were not.</span> <span id="s377">They tried to enter different institutes when they could.</span> <span id="s378">None of them studied with me.</span> <span id="s379">At the institute I didn't have friends, I had only people with whom I studied, you see?</span> <span id="s380">Colleagues.</span> <span id="s381">That's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">(So you went through those four years at the Physical Technical Institute with relatively few problems then?)</span> <span id="s383">Yeah, with relatively few problems, yes.</span> <span id="s384">(And when you finished, did you immediately go to work or did you start school for further education?)</span> <span id="s385">Then I changed the institution and started my education at an absolutely different place in Moscow in the center.</span> <span id="s386">(That was in 1973?)</span> <span id="s387">Yeah, I think so.</span> <span id="s388">Probably '73, maybe '74.</span> <span id="s389">(What degree did you want now, a Master's degree?)</span> <span id="s390">A Master's, yes, in Applied Math.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">(How was it there for you?)</span> <span id="s392">Absolutely different.</span> <span id="s393">At this institute we had a very big Jewish population of students.</span> <span id="s394">(How do you explain that?)</span> <span id="s395">I can explain.</span> <span id="s396">There many of them tried to enter different institutes, like Moscow State University.</span> <span id="s397">To be exact, it the Mathematical and Mechanical Department of Moscow State University, a very good and famous university with a very good system of education, and a very tough antiSemitic system.</span> <span id="s398">It's very well known to everybody.</span> <span id="s399">They simply didn't try to hide this, that they were antiSemites, and they tried not to accept Jews, and so on.</span> <span id="s400">But still, many of the people whom I knew tried to enter this institute, and so on.</span> <span id="s401">They couldn't.</span> <span id="s402">They didn't pass the exams.</span> <span id="s403">A stupid story.</span> <span id="s404">And then Jews always tried to try to find a different way, a different place to get education, for something different.</span> <span id="s405">But to reach the goal, you see, if you'd like... I'm talking about students whom I knew, people with whom I studied.</span> <span id="s406">If they couldn't enter this institute, but they knew exactly what they wanted, they knew what type of education they wanted to get, they tried to find different places.</span> <span id="s407">For instance, this place was very good from this point of view because they had a very good math department.</span> <span id="s408">Because the same story happened with professors in Russia as with students.</span> <span id="s409">Students were treated differently, but of course teachers too.</span> <span id="s410">Some of them couldn't get jobs at different institutes.</span> <span id="s411">They couldn't find a job where they were looking for, and they tried to find different places.</span> <span id="s412">And they found, say, like ubezhishche [refuge, asylum - sk].</span> <span id="s413">They tried to find a place under a roof where they could live, work, do what they wanted to do.</span> <span id="s414">And that was a very good department with good teachers.</span> <span id="s415">There were very good students.</span> <span id="s416">The position of the department, of the institute, depends not only on professors, but on students too.</span> <span id="s417">And I realized this thing now in America better probably than in Russia.</span> <span id="s418">And students were at the level of education, of exams that was very good.</span> <span id="s419">Probably half the students were Jews, maybe more.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">(And how big was this class?)</span> <span id="s421">Not as big, maybe 70.</span> <span id="s422">(And the school itself was very big?)</span> <span id="s423">It was a very big institute.</span> <span id="s424">In Russia the system of education is different from American, and most of Russian places to get education are not universities, but they are institutes special institutes with special orientation, like engineering.</span> <span id="s425">For instance, this word "transportation" said nothing for me right now.</span> <span id="s426">I don't know anything about transportation.</span> <span id="s427">An interesting story my diploma, thesis... I'm talking about graduating thesis to get the degree.</span> <span id="s428">Later on I got Ph.D., but this is a different story I'm not talking about this.</span> <span id="s429">At the institute, my thesis was purely mathematical.</span> <span id="s430">You have some kind of problem, and so on.</span> <span id="s431">Before the last exam before I was ready to defend my thesis, my dad gave me some advice.</span> <span id="s432">It is something irrelevant.</span> <span id="s433">You are talking about math at the Institute of Transportation.</span> <span id="s434">Probably you need something from this... Why not draw a big train on a big sheet of paper, like an interesting picture for everybody.</span> <span id="s435">The picture of the train could be the only thing about transportation that I know!</span> <span id="s436">You see, you could study anything...</span></p> <p><span id="s437">(Did you really draw a picture?)</span> <span id="s438">No, no, it was a joke.</span> <span id="s439">(So without any problems you went through this institute.</span> <span id="s440">You defended your thesis and that was fine.</span> <span id="s441">Now it's about 1977?)</span> <span id="s442">I got my degree in 1976.</span> <span id="s443">This institute really had many problems.</span> <span id="s444">This is the institute that expelled some of the students because of attending synagogue, and we had a very big story, maybe another day I'll try to show you.</span> <span id="s445">Once, I don't know how to explain all the details they are absolutely unnatural for Americans but it was a process when do you know this word Komsomol?</span> <span id="s446">(Sure.)</span> <span id="s447">Good.</span> <span id="s448">When the Komsomol organization of the institute... (And you were a member?)</span> <span id="s449">Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s450">They were blaming us students most of our students were Jews and they were blaming us because of our way to behave ourselves, to get education, that we do not take part in the special Komsomol life, that we are not doing everything that they require, that we're supposed to do, etc.</span> <span id="s451">Now, things in the system of Russian education is absolutely different, and they realize that it was stupidity then now I'm not sure that the Komsomol really exists.</span> <span id="s452">I'm sure yes, but I think it really disintegrated.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">(Still Dec. 12, 1990, talking about Komsomol leadership at the Institute of Transportation.)</span> <span id="s454">I'm not sure that I'll be able to tell many stories about the Komsomol.</span> <span id="s455">I would like to do this.</span> <span id="s456">But maybe to explain some things, this organization, the Komsomol, it was a special organization to govern the youth of the country.</span> <span id="s457">Because, you see, now I'm trying to talk from the point of view of the party chief, that young people, young students, youngsters, they do not know exactly the way, what to do, where to go, and so on.</span> <span id="s458">We have to govern them.</span> <span id="s459">We have to keep everything in our way, not to lose all [...].</span> <span id="s460">You see, this is exactly the organization the Komsomol.</span> <span id="s461">In our generation, everybody was members of this organization, the Komsomol, crossing the level of fifteen years old, you had to enter this organization, otherwise you would be blamed.</span> <span id="s462">For instance, it's another difficulty to enter the institute if you are not a Komsomol member.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">(So you were literally forced to become members.</span> <span id="s464">Did you have to pay dues?)</span> <span id="s465">Yeah, we had to, but sometimes dues were absolutely nominal, like 2, 3, 5 kopeks.</span> <span id="s466">But later on when people get salary, then it could be something substantial, a part of your salary.</span> <span id="s467">But this organization, this is really something special, to deal with the young generation of the country not to allow this stream to enter different sources, not to go a different direction, you see?</span> <span id="s468">(To control the direction...) Exactly, yes.</span> <span id="s469">And from this organization, this was the way... Really it was the source of very bad things, when young people, young men and women, trying to get good positions in the Communist party leadership, they were prepared to do everything, to do whatever you want.</span> <span id="s470">They could say anything to their friends, and so on.</span> <span id="s471">Anyway, this is the problem.</span> <span id="s472">The worst remembrance that I brought from Russia, the Komsomol organization.</span> <span id="s473">It's something very frustrating for me and for my friends, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">(During this period, did you have access to any of the samizdat publications, any of the forbidden or underground publications?</span> <span id="s475">Were you reading any of those things?)</span> <span id="s476">What do you mean "access"?</span> <span id="s477">The idea of samizdat, and the idea of underground publication, it means that this is the source without access.</span> <span id="s478">Somebody tries to publish, to issue, and then it spreads automatically, from hand to hand.</span> <span id="s479">It spreads without any control.</span> <span id="s480">And if you're lucky, of course, and we had, we tried to find something.</span> <span id="s481">By the way, it was another very interesting source of information, of knowledge about everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">(When did you first have opportunity to read something like that?)</span> <span id="s483">I don't remember.</span> <span id="s484">Probably I picked up something from my parents.</span> <span id="s485">Sometimes they used to bring something at home, too.</span> <span id="s486">I'm not sure that at that time that they liked to show everything to me, because, you see, when you're a parent, you think that your kid is young and might not understand exactly everything.</span> <span id="s487">Probably they were scared.</span> <span id="s488">(You may have found something.)</span> <span id="s489">Yes, I saw... (Do you remember what it was?)</span> <span id="s490">The first thing, I probably don't remember what it was, but I can recall stories, books and information that I got through this source.</span> <span id="s491">I read some stories by Solzhenitsyn, but not the most interesting.</span> <span id="s492">The most interesting for me were stories about Jewish history, about holidays, and I recall the book by two Churchills, a book about the sixday war.</span> <span id="s493">Do you know this book?</span> <span id="s494">It's probably The Six Day War.</span> <span id="s495">Churchill's son was in Britain at that moment, and his grandson was in Israel as a journalist, and they wrote this book and I got 80% of information about this event through this book.</span> <span id="s496">At that time we could find poems of Russian poets like Akhmatova.</span> <span id="s497">Even Akhmatova, she was Russian, and Mandelshtam, of course I read Mandelshtam first in samizdat, and later, what else?</span> <span id="s498">It was a Jewish journal about everything.</span> <span id="s499">(About the emigration movements?)</span> <span id="s500">Oh yes.</span> <span id="s501">Something about emigration, too.</span> <span id="s502">What else?</span> <span id="s503">Step by step, about everything.</span> <span id="s504">(There was a book in 1972 Jews In The U.S.S.R., devoted to the history and culture and personal problems of Jews.</span> <span id="s505">We have this here on this time line...) Yes, it was.</span> <span id="s506">(So you were pretty current.</span> <span id="s507">You could keep up with what was going on pretty much at the time it was happening...) we tried, I'm not sure that we were, but we tried.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">(For example, were you aware when Solzhenitsyn was arrested and sent to prison did you know anything about that?)</span> <span id="s509">Yes.</span> <span id="s510">We knew because some materials had been published in newspapers and we could read them, and again, even at the moment of publication that it wasn't exactly the truth.</span> <span id="s511">It was something that had been prepared by the government, and so on.</span> <span id="s512">You see, in Russia at that time it was like a game between population and government.</span> <span id="s513">Government tried to show the performance, and public, population, people, I don't know the best way to say, people tried to show that they do really believe in this performance, you see.</span> <span id="s514">But actually nobody really believed it except some small group of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">(What about Sakharov.</span> <span id="s516">He was later of course...) Yeah, a little bit.</span> <span id="s517">(How about Sharansky?)</span> <span id="s518">Yeah, in Russia, of course we knew.</span> <span id="s519">And of course I learned more when I tried to emigrate, when I happened to be involved in this process of emigration, of course I learned more.</span> <span id="s520">But this is a strange way to get information in Russia.</span> <span id="s521">Always you try to pick up different sources, friends, radio, samizdat.</span> <span id="s522">Actually, friends... (So you kept each other informed?)</span> <span id="s523">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">(So you were definitely aware that certain things were going on and yet while you were at the institute you had to be careful because of the Komsomol and this and that.</span> <span id="s525">So now you've finished at the Institute of Transportation.</span> <span id="s526">And you want to go on now for a Ph.D.</span> <span id="s527">Did you work for awhile or go to school?)</span> <span id="s528">Again, as I told you, life of a Jew in Russia, it's like a long way with barriers.</span> <span id="s529">First barrier, say you enter the institute and you got an education, you were lucky, but then there is the next very strong, very heavy barrier to get a job that you would like to have.</span> <span id="s530">This is the strongest barrier.</span> <span id="s531">For instance, again, the system in Russia to get a job is absolutely different from American.</span> <span id="s532">In America it's a system of free choice.</span> <span id="s533">There are many companies, and many students on the market.</span> <span id="s534">You have to write down your resume and send it to everybody, and to look, and I don't know... But in Russia, there's a special system of distribution of positions, and each institute has a list of positions, of working places, that you could apply for, and they bring this list, and sometimes you have the choice to find or to choose something from this list.</span> <span id="s535">Sometimes you do not have, it depends.</span> <span id="s536">Mostly, you have the chance to find something from this list.</span> <span id="s537">And when I got my Master's, I was a really good student, I had rather high grades, probably I was like, maybe, seventh, eighth, maybe ninth from 100 students.</span> <span id="s538">It's a not bad result.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">(And you were competing with a specialized group...) Right.</span> <span id="s540">(So did they give you where you wanted to go?)</span> <span id="s541">No.</span> <span id="s542">At first I wanted to get the position at the institute that wasn't on this list.</span> <span id="s543">(Did you wish to teach?)</span> <span id="s544">No.</span> <span id="s545">(What did you wish to do?)</span> <span id="s546">I wished to make some kind of research.</span> <span id="s547">(What kind of research was it?)</span> <span id="s548">You see, at that time I didn't know very much, I didn't know exactly what I was wishing to do.</span> <span id="s549">I knew that I wanted to deal with some kind of physics and math problems, but I wasn't exact in my wishes yet.</span> <span id="s550">And then I found something from this list.</span> <span id="s551">It was a scientific research institute in this department the Department of Transportation.</span> <span id="s552">In Russia it's a big department.</span> <span id="s553">It's called the Ministry of Transportation, of Railways.</span> <span id="s554">And they have a big research institute.</span> <span id="s555">And I found one position on the list for this institute, and I applied to the guy, to the man who came from this institute to find somebody.</span> <span id="s556">And he said that okay, I'm very good.</span> <span id="s557">He would like to hire me, to see me at the institute, and so on.</span> <span id="s558">Then I was at the institute looking at the working place, at what they were doing.</span> <span id="s559">We almost came to an agreement.</span> <span id="s560">But then in a week I gave him a call and suddenly he said, "Oh you see, I don't know what happened, but our position is closed.</span> <span id="s561">Now I can't hire you.</span> <span id="s562">I'm so sorry..." And the real story was next.</span> <span id="s563">You see, I have a Russian last name.</span> <span id="s564">And he didn't recognize me as a Jew.</span> <span id="s565">He simply didn't know that I was a Jew until he got my documents.</span> <span id="s566">And from the documents, he mentioned that now in the department not the benefits or payroll department, it's the personnel department he said that he was in Personnel and he couldn't offer me this position.</span> <span id="s567">Exactly the story was that he got my documents and realized that I was a Jew!</span> <span id="s568">But to tell you the truth, at that moment I wasn't frustrated at all because I expected something like this.</span> <span id="s569">Then, looking for a job, I got a position at a small branch of this institute something irrelevant, in a different place and so on.</span> <span id="s570">Again, at that moment my mother helped me.</span> <span id="s571">It's a usual way in Russia when parents, through their friends and relatives, try to help their kids, their sons and daughters, to get a job.</span> <span id="s572">I got something, but it wasn't the best place.</span> <span id="s573">I tried to do something that I thought probably could be valuable, something interesting, but anyway... (This wasn't really challenging?)</span> <span id="s574">Right.</span> <span id="s575">(So how long did you stay at this institute?)</span> <span id="s576">Probably for three years.</span> <span id="s577">(Until 1979 then.)</span> <span id="s578">No.</span> <span id="s579">From 1976 yes, until the end of 1979.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">(Then what happened?)</span> <span id="s581">Then again, then I was lucky and a friend of my parents' helped me to enter an absolutely different institute.</span> <span id="s582">It was an institute of metallurgical department.</span> <span id="s583">It was the Institute of Metal Physics.</span> <span id="s584">And the total name of the institute was the Institute of Ferrous Metallurgy.</span> <span id="s585">(This is where you did your doctoral thesis?)</span> <span id="s586">Right, exactly.</span> <span id="s587">(What was your subject?</span> <span id="s588">By this time you had a better idea of what...) Right.</span> <span id="s589">The first idea I got from my supervisor, from my advisor.</span> <span id="s590">I started to work in the area of solidification, in the area of metallurgy of physical metallurgy and material science exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">(That was the area that your thesis was in?)</span> <span id="s592">Yes, exactly.</span> <span id="s593">(What was the title of your work?)</span> <span id="s594">There is a special term: dendritic solidification.</span> <span id="s595">Dendrite is a tree in Greek.</span> <span id="s596">(How long did that take?)</span> <span id="s597">I took, let's say, almost five years to get the degree.</span> <span id="s598">(So in 1983 already.)</span> <span id="s599">I started in 1980 and in 1985 I got the degree.</span> <span id="s600">But at first I was doing the work.</span> <span id="s601">Then I was writing the thesis and I was working.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">(Was it during this period or after you finished your thesis that you met Lilia?)</span> <span id="s603">After.</span> <span id="s604">I met Lilia when I was a Doctor, after that.</span> <span id="s605">I met her in 1986.</span> <span id="s606">(So it was the following year.)</span> <span id="s607">Yeah, that year.</span> <span id="s608">(So after you got your thesis done, there should have been fewer barriers now.)</span> <span id="s609">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">But again, let's try to talk about barriers.</span> <span id="s611">I could get through this barrier.</span> <span id="s612">I could get the work that I was thinking about, that was good for me because of friends and so on, because of chance.</span> <span id="s613">It was chance that at that moment they could accept a Jew to this institute.</span> <span id="s614">Anyway, it was an interesting place.</span> <span id="s615">But from the early '50s, maybe from the '60s, very many Jews worked for this institute, and they had a very interesting company.</span> <span id="s616">This is a famous place.</span> <span id="s617">Here in America at Northwestern, very many people are wellknown from... (This is the school you went to that you remained at working or this is a whole different place?)</span> <span id="s618">The same place.</span> <span id="s619">It's the Department of Metal Physics at the Institute of Ferrous Metallurgy.</span> <span id="s620">It's difficult to explain the structure of this institute.</span> <span id="s621">It's a big institute of ferrous metallurgy, and there are different departments.</span> <span id="s622">And one of the departments was the physical department.</span> <span id="s623">Okay.</span> <span id="s624">And it was a vocational institute, not exactly a teaching institute, an institute for students.</span> <span id="s625">They didn't have an undergraduate program, only small, not very big, but good graduate program.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">(So you stayed on to be a professor there?)</span> <span id="s627">No.</span> <span id="s628">I got the Ph.D. and I started to work for this institute doing research.</span> <span id="s629">And to get a professorship at this institute didn't mean anything because they didn't have an undergraduate program.</span> <span id="s630">It wasn't an institute for teaching.</span> <span id="s631">It was an institute for research.</span> <span id="s632">(So how long did you stay at this place?)</span> <span id="s633">I entered the institute in 1980 and stayed until I emigrated from the Russia for eight or nine years.</span> <span id="s634">(So when you met Lilia you were now a researcher with your doctorate at this institute.)</span> <span id="s635">Right.</span> <span id="s636">(At this point in your life you were able to go skiing.)</span> <span id="s637">[laughs] Yes.</span> <span id="s638">It wasn't my first ski trip.</span> <span id="s639">Working at this institute, I started to ski and liked downhill skiing.</span> <span id="s640">No, it wasn't my first trip.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">(You probably had some sense that you were going to get married, but you didn't know to whom, right?)</span> <span id="s642">Yeah.</span> <span id="s643">(Was it important to you to marry somebody Jewish?)</span> <span id="s644">Yes, it was.</span> <span id="s645">By all means, of course.</span> <span id="s646">(Do you remember how you met?</span> <span id="s647">Were you with Jewish friends when you met?)</span> <span id="s648">By chance, I was.</span> <span id="s649">We met each other.</span> <span id="s650">It was far from Moscow in a small, northern town in the mountains.</span> <span id="s651">It was a company from Moscow, almost all of us were Muscovites.</span> <span id="s652">And I was with my friend, an interesting man, with whom I worked at the institute and with whom I published a paper.</span> <span id="s653">And he emigrated a year before me.</span> <span id="s654">And now he is in Maryland and we came to see his friend.</span> <span id="s655">It happened to be that Lilia was in this room.</span> <span id="s656">She came to see her friend.</span> <span id="s657">It was the same company.</span> <span id="s658">I think it was a regular story.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">The only unusual thing that I see was that we met each other far from Moscow, but we lived in Moscow in the same region, not very close, but in the same region.</span> <span id="s660">We didn't meet each other in Moscow.</span> <span id="s661">For instance, we used the same metro station in Russia to get to work.</span> <span id="s662">We used the same metro station, but never met.</span> <span id="s663">But we met each other 1,500 miles away from Moscow.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">(When you met, did you know at that point that you were thinking of emigrating?)</span> <span id="s665">[end of tape] Second Interview: ALEX UMANTSEV DATE: January 15, 1991</span></p> <p><span id="s666">INTERVIEWER: E.

Right, mixed company.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">(When you saw her did you recognize that this was a Jewish person?)</span> <span id="s682">I didn't recognize immediately, but Lilia said that she did.</span> <span id="s683">Somehow, probably, women are more experienced in all these things like that.</span> <span id="s684">I'm not sure.</span> <span id="s685">But later on, talking step by step--- By the way, again, that's interesting.</span> <span id="s686">At that time it was a crisis.</span> <span id="s687">It was some kind of crisis in the Middle East, too.</span> <span id="s688">It was a difficult time for Israel.</span> <span id="s689">I don't remember exactly.</span> <span id="s690">It was in 1984, I believe.</span> <span id="s691">(About the time of the Yom Kippur war?)</span> <span id="s692">That was in 1973.</span> <span id="s693">(The Lebanese invasion...)

It's interesting that we're talking about special things to specifically place in concern with this event and this, and somehow we touch a great idea, the special idea of life in Russia, that when Communist ideology came, it had to substitute the place that religion had in human life by something, by their own ideas.</span> <span id="s759">And when it was close to the human life, it had very rude forms substituting something, say a religious idea with a Communist idea, with the idea that you belong to the State, that your life belongs to the State, you have to do this, that, and so on.</span> <span id="s760">And this is everywhere through your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Always you get the idea starting from kindergarten, and of course school and university, everywhere, special idea.</span> <span id="s762">You are trained in this way.</span> <span id="s763">You are prepared by somebody else, and you have to prepare yourself by yourself in this direction.</span> <span id="s764">That's why it's impossible... Of course this is difficult for everybody, not only for Jews.</span> <span id="s765">But why it's more difficult for Jews, because this idea expels and eliminates Jews, and they are filling the pool, absolutely.</span> <span id="s766">Then this is much worse for Jews, too, but for people in general this is not good, this stuff.</span> <span id="s767">Now people realize all things and they simply threw out almost the entire idea, immediately, in one year.</span> <span id="s768">Everybody knew that this is something extra in your life, something very dangerous and unnecessary.</span> <span id="s769">They threw it out very easily.</span> <span id="s770">At first people started this process of the renovation of history.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">(You're going all the way back to the revolution 1917...) Sure, right.</span> <span id="s772">(In 1917 they threw out religion...) Exactly.</span> <span id="s773">This is the moment I'm talking about.</span> <span id="s774">Everything started from the Revolution, and now people have recognized all things that have happened, and they tried to throw out ideology and they're coming back to a religious point of view and education and so on.</span> <span id="s775">Of course, I'm not talking about subsidiary processes, because this process of Russian national recognition brought them this branch, this strong stream of antisemitism too.</span> <span id="s776">Because Russians, now they're recognizing themselves not as Communists, because the Communist idea is that everybody is equal and we are not nationalities, we are working class.</span> <span id="s777">There are no nationalities, there are only working people and capitalists.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Dividing people (Economics...) Right, dividing people according to special reasons.</span> <span id="s779">And now they are recognizing themselves as a Russian nation.</span> <span id="s780">They are trying to condemn Jews, and of course this process of recognition as a nation brought antisemitism, too.</span> <span id="s781">But maybe, I do not know exactly, we are trying to follow events, but maybe the last events happening in Russia show that antisemitism isn't popular in Russia, and even in the Ukraine.</span> <span id="s782">The Ukraine was much more antisemitic than Russia.</span> <span id="s783">Why?</span> <span id="s784">Because now the most important point in Russia is simply food.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">(But other people have voiced a different view of that than you have.</span> <span id="s786">That's very interesting.</span> <span id="s787">They say that when there are shortages, blame it on the Jews.)</span> <span id="s788">Exactly.</span> <span id="s789">That's true.</span> <span id="s790">But, you see, surely you're right.</span> <span id="s791">But starting to do this, later on people somehow realized that even if they would do something wrong to Jews... right now Jews have simply started to leave Russia... nothing happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">(But they are saying that the reason they are leaving is because they are afraid.</span> <span id="s793">You know Pamjat', a very antisemitic organization, has threatened them and there were many incidents reported last late winter, early spring things were happening.</span> <span id="s794">I haven't heard anything now, if that reflects that there is nothing going on, or just the fact that the Jews aren't moving so quickly.</span> <span id="s795">We were told right now there's an arrival in Tel Aviv of a hundred Soviet Jews an hour.)</span> <span id="s796">Yes, I know.</span> <span id="s797">One day before the New Year, each halfhour arrived one plane.</span> <span id="s798">Yes.</span> <span id="s799">(And this hasn't lessened one bit.</span> <span id="s800">I spoke to an Israeli woman today who is visiting the U.S. She's going back a week from today.</span> <span id="s801">She's uneasy being here this long because her family is there.</span> <span id="s802">And she says that even with this threat of war, she says that there are no less coming in.</span> <span id="s803">The same number are streaming into Israel.)</span> <span id="s804">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">(So why is that?)</span> <span id="s806">Okay, I will try to explain what I think about that.</span> <span id="s807">To some extent, anyway, despite the war, Jews feel themselves more protected in Israel than in Russia.</span> <span id="s808">See?</span> <span id="s809">Even if it's a war, or close to war situation, and of course, now they can see that the situation is bad and becoming worse.</span> <span id="s810">And it won't be better.</span> <span id="s811">You see, everybody needs to eat, to be protected, and these are exactly the two things that are in short supply in Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">(When you say "to be protected", are you talking about from danger or from the weather?)</span> <span id="s813">Not weather.</span> <span id="s814">This is not the point in favor of Israel, because many of them come from northern parts of Russia and they're used to having a different climate.</span> <span id="s815">Then the southern climate in Israel, the moist weather, is a different thing, but they come in spite of this.</span> <span id="s816">No, of course not the weather.</span> <span id="s817">(I mean shelter...) A roof, I see.</span> <span id="s818">(For some people Israel is not a good climate at all.)</span> <span id="s819">Not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">(I realize this is a difficult thing to ask someone who is here in the U.S., because this is where you wanted to come, but if you were at home now in Moscow...) You're going to ask me if I would leave Russia for Israel.</span> <span id="s821">No question.</span> <span id="s822">Of course.</span> <span id="s823">(At this moment, knowing there could be a war there any day, would you leave Russia for Israel now?)</span> <span id="s824">That's really difficult to answer, because we were not hesitating at all.</span> <span id="s825">We were thinking about that when we married.</span> <span id="s826">(That takes me back to the marriage, because Lilia said in her interview that almost maybe from the very time you got married, you were talking about emigrating.)</span> <span id="s827">Yeah, that's true.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">(So let's go back.</span> <span id="s829">What made you want to emigrate from the time you got married?)</span> <span id="s830">At first I wanted to emigrate, not starting from the time we got married.</span> <span id="s831">I wanted to emigrate ten years ago [previously] when I finished my institute and when I started to understand things that were happening.</span> <span id="s832">I wanted to do this, but at that time, it was 1979, at the end of the year, and at that moment, Russian policy changed and very many things happened.</span> <span id="s833">Russians simply closed the gates.</span> <span id="s834">I couldn't get out.</span> <span id="s835">For ten years I had to find some kind of occupation, work.</span> <span id="s836">I was lucky that I could.</span> <span id="s837">I can't say that I was wasting time.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">(You accomplished something.)</span> <span id="s839">Something, more or less.</span> <span id="s840">Maybe not very bad, trying to do the best.</span> <span id="s841">But when I met Lilia and we started to talk about things like that, to tell you the truth, we didn't talk much, because quickly we realized that we have absolutely the same opinion, and when you have the same opinion, you don't have much to talk about, you see?</span> <span id="s842">We were only waiting for the moment.</span> <span id="s843">But we were not sure that the moment could come.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Of course, that moment wasn't absolutely clear.</span> <span id="s845">The situation could change quickly and so drastically for Russia that the president of Russia wouldn't have anything else except, "let them go."</span> <span id="s846">When it happened we were almost the first.</span> <span id="s847">My cousins, probably they were almost the first who left Russia with Gorbachev, as people say, during the fourth wave.</span> <span id="s848">Now, counting back to the Revolution, people enumerate our emigration as the fourth wave.</span> <span id="s849">But it depends upon the point of view.</span> <span id="s850">First, after the Revolution, then before the war, immediately after the war, the third in the '70s that finished in 1979.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Now this is Gorbachev's, the fourth wave.</span> <span id="s852">We really can call it Gorbachev's, because he gave permission.</span> <span id="s853">It's a difficult question.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">(So you saw it was hopeless.</span> <span id="s855">You lived your life trying to make it worthwhile, and during that period, were you expecting that there would be an opportunity again because there was an opportunity in 1979?)</span> <span id="s856">Yes, I felt there would be.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">(When did you sense that the opportunity had come?</span> <span id="s858">What happened?</span> <span id="s859">What occurred that made you say "now is the time to apply"?)</span> <span id="s860">That's not a difficult question.</span> <span id="s861">At first, of course there were very slight marks, Gorbachev trying to change the situation... (You mean "signs"...) Signs, yeah.</span> <span id="s862">At first, we got very slight signs when he was trying to change something in Russia and outside Russia, when he was trying to gain some kind of better opinion and some kind of help from Western countries and America.</span> <span id="s863">He permitted more freedom and more contacts with Western countries.</span> <span id="s864">It was close to the situation in the '70s, the period of time that was called Detente.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">But then we got strong, very strong, clear signs.</span> <span id="s866">What kind?</span> <span id="s867">I had very many friends who were... I forgot the proper name, they were refugees... (Refuseniks?)</span> <span id="s868">Right, refuseniks.</span> <span id="s869">(That was going to be my next question did you know any refuseniks?)</span> <span id="s870">A lot of them.</span> <span id="s871">(In the true sense of the word?</span> <span id="s872">Where they lost their jobs or had to take a less important job?</span> <span id="s873">They were struggling just to stay...) If it is your next question, then I can tell you some of the stories that I know exactly.</span> <span id="s874">My cousins who came here a year before us were refuseniks for ten years.</span> <span id="s875">(What is their name?)</span> <span id="s876">Rothstein.</span> <span id="s877">A rather big family.</span> <span id="s878">(They live in Chicago?)</span> <span id="s879">Yes, all of them live in Chicago now.</span> <span id="s880">That's the reason we came here.</span> <span id="s881">(They sponsored you?)</span> <span id="s882">Yeah.</span> <span id="s883">We got a grant?</span> <span id="s884">Like a visa... You have to have some kind of relatives, friends... (Sponsors) Sponsors.</span> <span id="s885">They sponsored us.</span> <span id="s886">Exactly.</span> <span id="s887">My cousins really lost their jobs.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">(What did they do?)</span> <span id="s889">I can't tell you exactly right now.</span> <span id="s890">I can't remember it was so a long time ago.</span> <span id="s891">My cousin, he worked... The story was they were very active and my cousin, she was trying to bring all people who wanted to leave Russia, to bring them together.</span> <span id="s892">She was making lists of names.</span> <span id="s893">They were gathering meetings.</span> <span id="s894">Very many times they were held by the Ukrainian KGB.</span> <span id="s895">They lived in Kiev.</span> <span id="s896">They had very many problems.</span> <span id="s897">By the way, their father lost his job.</span> <span id="s898">He was a geologist.</span> <span id="s899">He worked for some kind of geological enterprise in Kiev.</span> <span id="s900">Maybe he was connected with some kind of secret projects I don't know exactly and he lost his job when his administration knew about his children, that his children were involved in this kind of activity.</span> <span id="s901">He lost his job.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">My cousins were changing jobs from time to time because they were not supposed to have something interesting.</span> <span id="s903">For five to six years they were living only waiting for permission.</span> <span id="s904">They were refused.</span> <span id="s905">They got refusal.</span> <span id="s906">Very many times in 1979 they came to my place in Moscow because they tried to apply to Central... not committee, not organization... (OVIR?)</span> <span id="s907">Yes, I didn't want to use this name, but if you know this name, then it's exactly right OVIR.</span> <span id="s908">It's an abbreviation.</span> <span id="s909">I can tell you exactly what it means, but anyway... For five years, they lived each day living and thinking about this chance, the opportunity to leave the country.</span> <span id="s910">Then after these five years probably they dropped this idea and started to find different kinds of activities, to find something for living in Russia.</span> <span id="s911">Maybe they lost this feeling that they would be able to leave Russia.</span> <span id="s912">(They lost hope.)</span> <span id="s913">Hope, exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">Then, in 1988, I believe, they pretty much... (They received the visas...) Right.</span> <span id="s915">I'm trying to organize this period of time, because nobody expected... I think it was unexpectedly, they got the permission.</span> <span id="s916">They got the phone call.</span> <span id="s917">They were asked to come to Ukrainian OVIR, and if they would like now, they were told that they are reviewing all kinds of documents, and found that they were refused many years, and if they would like, they could leave Russia right now.</span> <span id="s918">And they did, in spite of the fact that my cousin, he had different family.</span> <span id="s919">At that moment in time he had different family than at the moment that he applied documents.</span> <span id="s920">And now suddenly Russian officials had a different application.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">(You mean he was divorced?)</span> <span id="s922">Right, and he married a different woman.</span> <span id="s923">This is an interesting thing, before the Russian officials were very... I'm not going to say accurate, but they were very careful about all things because, as my wife says, they are continuated?</span> <span id="s924">... (Situated?)</span> <span id="s925">No... When you are trying to find a radio station on the radio you are trying to tune the radio, yeah?</span> <span id="s926">And when you've found your station, it's in one exact position.</span> <span id="s927">And this one position is the story of Russian organizations like this.</span> <span id="s928">They had one exact position, and this position is to refuse.</span> <span id="s929">[laughs] There are a bunch of different outlets, ways to answer the question, but they have only one.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">It was very strange that they got permission because he had another family.</span> <span id="s931">By the way, my [female] cousin had a very good situation to refuse, because different documents.</span> <span id="s932">You start your process from the very beginning, the invitation, you could not know anything.</span> <span id="s933">But now the situation was different.</span> <span id="s934">That was a very strong sign that policy is different.</span> <span id="s935">At first we thought that it could be that things were different only for people who waited ten years.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">(So you thought you had to be on the old list?)</span> <span id="s937">Right, but we were not, because at that time they simply didn't want to deal with my documents at all.</span> <span id="s938">(So in 1988 you applied?)</span> <span id="s939">Yes.</span> <span id="s940">(Do you remember what month it was?)</span> <span id="s941">Yeah, sure.</span> <span id="s942">But let me tell you a different story that happened with my friend, my colleague, the man I worked with.</span> <span id="s943">We were colleagues.</span> <span id="s944">We worked in the same laboratory.</span> <span id="s945">The same business... but then science is not a business, it's necessary to remember.</span> <span id="s946">(You could say "in the same work".)</span> <span id="s947">Sure!</span> <span id="s948">I can do that, but this is the way I hear people using this word!</span> <span id="s949">(But you were friends as well as colleagues...) Yes.</span> <span id="s950">(Was he older than you?)</span> <span id="s951">He is much older.</span> <span id="s952">It's interesting.</span> <span id="s953">He was the man with whom I was on my vacation when I met Lilia.</span> <span id="s954">At the same time he came to that company, and so on.</span> <span id="s955">So he considered himself a shafer in Russian.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">(A person who arranges marriages?</span> <span id="s957">In Yiddish there's the word shafrat.)</span> <span id="s958">Could be.</span> <span id="s959">(Lilia's name is Shafran, so that's not a Russian name?)</span> <span id="s960">Of course not.</span> <span id="s961">Shafran is not a Russian word.</span> <span id="s962">There is a Spanish flower, saffron, a sort of spice... (So this was someone you worked with and liked, and you looked up to him...) Yeah, right.</span> <span id="s963">But the story about this man is that he was a refusenik for ten years, too.</span> <span id="s964">He applied at the same time as his brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">(Was he a bachelor?)</span> <span id="s966">No.</span> <span id="s967">He was married for a long time.</span> <span id="s968">He had a family of four people.</span> <span id="s969">He has two kids.</span> <span id="s970">His parents died a couple of years before we got acquainted.</span> <span id="s971">But his brother left Russia during that very convenient period of time in the late '70s, and he got a very interesting job in New York.</span> <span id="s972">Now he lives here for twelve or more years.</span> <span id="s973">But my friend could not.</span> <span id="s974">He was late.</span> <span id="s975">He wasn't waiting or wasting time, no.</span> <span id="s976">He wasn't so quick as his brother.</span> <span id="s977">And he couldn't leave Russia, but he wanted to, and when I came to that laboratory, after a short period of time I realized that he was, as people used to say, v podache.</span> <span id="s978">It means "in appliance", that you've applied and are waiting.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">(I don't think we have a comparable type of word.)</span> <span id="s980">Anyway, an interesting story with this man.</span> <span id="s981">(Can you say his name?)</span> <span id="s982">Sure, his name is Alek Reibord.</span> <span id="s983">By the way, now his daughter is here in Chicago.</span> <span id="s984">For some period of time she works for the Jewish community service.</span> <span id="s985">(Does he live in Chicago?)</span> <span id="s986">No, he's in Maryland, close to Washington D.C.</span> <span id="s987">He worked at the National Bureau of Standards, and now he got a professorship in Maryland.</span> <span id="s988">The interesting story: He was much older.</span> <span id="s989">He worked many years for the same laboratory.</span> <span id="s990">He wrote many papers.</span> <span id="s991">He was famous in Russia and America.</span> <span id="s992">He had results and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">He expected, after things rapidly changed in Russia in the late '70s and early '80s, he expected to lose his job.</span> <span id="s994">It wouldn't be surprising for him.</span> <span id="s995">He knew that he could lose his job, lose his position, lose friends, colleagues, people to work with.</span> <span id="s996">He would lose everything in a short period of time.</span> <span id="s997">[laughs] And I expected something like this too.</span> <span id="s998">But, very interesting that it didn't happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">And for ten years he worked in the same laboratory, in our laboratory, in our institute, doing things that he wanted, bringing much of interest to science, to different areas that we were working in.</span> <span id="s1000">This is for sure because of the chief of our laboratory, of course, and because of special atmosphere at the institute.</span> <span id="s1001">But this is a difficult question.</span> <span id="s1002">I'm not sure I'd like to touch... It's a long question.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">(He was able to continue work.)</span> <span id="s1004">The important thing is that we were not involved in any kind of secret projects.</span> <span id="s1005">Working in science, it's not a secret, because you must publish all your results openly, for everybody in this country and that country, all over.</span> <span id="s1006">This is not a secret.</span> <span id="s1007">Maybe because of this.</span> <span id="s1008">And different people who tried to get permission to leave the country from secret places, they simply couldn't get permission and they lost their jobs, because it was out of the rules of that game.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">(Was it a question of luck, of who you know?)</span> <span id="s1010">To some extent.</span> <span id="s1011">This is the question the luck of the place, of the people around you... (So in other words, if you had a boss who was...) Who wanted to... (Who was sadistic or antisemitic or...) Very good point.</span> <span id="s1012">We really had good people.</span> <span id="s1013">By the way, it's really an interesting laboratory.</span> <span id="s1014">And he was able, I think he was absolutely lucky, to stay at his job for that period of time and to work.</span> <span id="s1015">And he got the same phone call at the same moment as my cousins did.</span> <span id="s1016">And he was asked if he would like to leave the country.</span> <span id="s1017">(He was happy...) Yes.</span> <span id="s1018">(He was shocked...) Sure, almost everybody was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">(So did he make preparations to leave immediately?)</span> <span id="s1020">No.</span> <span id="s1021">You see, this is the difficult question why.</span> <span id="s1022">It's necessary to know this person.</span> <span id="s1023">Again, this is a question it's up to the personality, how quickly you can prepare yourself, how quickly you can take your bag, do all things and leave Russia.</span> <span id="s1024">My cousins, they left almost immediately.</span> <span id="s1025">Just signed all the papers and forgot about the old life.</span> <span id="s1026">But he couldn't, because he had very many connections, very many friends, things to finish there, preparations.</span> <span id="s1027">His preparations were really very long.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">(How long did it take him?)</span> <span id="s1029">Maybe a year, more than a year.</span> <span id="s1030">(Was he really getting his own personal papers in order, or was it just hard for him to leave after all?)</span> <span id="s1031">To some extent, it was really difficult to leave.</span> <span id="s1032">(Because he had to stop what he was doing?)</span> <span id="s1033">Of course, he used to live that type of life.</span> <span id="s1034">(How old was he in 1988?)</span> <span id="s1035">He was around 55.</span> <span id="s1036">If you have a younger generation who can earn a living and support you, then probably that's not so difficult, but if you are the only person responsible for the family, and now it's a question, if you are really valuable or not, if you're really worth something or not.</span> <span id="s1037">Because when you are living your old life, it's like a long, long road that could last for many years.</span> <span id="s1038">But when you are rapidly changing the way, when you are ready to dive in an absolutely different ocean, then it's like a reevaluation of yourself, of everything.</span> <span id="s1039">(He had to weigh the risks vs. rewards.)</span> <span id="s1040">Sure.</span> <span id="s1041">(It was almost a decade later, so things had changed a little.)</span> <span id="s1042">Sure.</span> <span id="s1043">(He had to think twice.)</span> <span id="s1044">Right.</span> <span id="s1045">Now we're measuring things in decades one decade back, one decade forward.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">(You got your invitation from the U.S..</span> <span id="s1047">.)</span> <span id="s1048">No, from Israel.</span> <span id="s1049">(Once you have the sponsorship in the U.S., it's possible for Israel to invite you, because they wouldn't let you leave unless it was an Israeli invitation, right?</span> <span id="s1050">The Russians wouldn't let you leave unless you had an invitation from your homeland, is that correct?)</span> <span id="s1051">In principle, that's correct.</span> <span id="s1052">I don't know very good this modern process.</span> <span id="s1053">Now probably the process is very simple, because you're supposed to go to Israel if you have Israeli invitation and to America if applied to American embassy.</span> <span id="s1054">But then the situation was different.</span> <span id="s1055">You know we're talking about Russia, a very special country.</span> <span id="s1056">What's necessary to do to get to America?</span> <span id="s1057">It is necessary, if you're in Russia, to get to America it's necessary to get an invitation from Israel, and then to buy a ticket to Vienna, Austria.</span> <span id="s1058">After that, Vienna is a switch point, and you can choose.</span> <span id="s1059">You can go to Israel or America, or you can say you'd like to go to Australia.</span> <span id="s1060">At that time it was different, but at that time the situation wasn't so tense as it is now.</span> <span id="s1061">We didn't hesitate.</span> <span id="s1062">We simply wanted, probably because of language, my wife and I knew English, and we didn't know anything about Hebrew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">(About Israel...?)</span> <span id="s1064">We knew some things about the state.</span> <span id="s1065">Lilia's aunt lives in Israel.</span> <span id="s1066">And of course I was worried very much about my job, about my work, about the possibility to find something to do that I would like to do.</span> <span id="s1067">Because of these reasons, we wanted to go to America.</span> <span id="s1068">But at that time, if the situation was like it is now, if we didn't have other way to go, of course we didn't hesitate, we would come to Israel.</span> <span id="s1069">That simply was the possibility that we were looking at, because when we were in Europe, it was a difficult time, because America started to reject people.</span> <span id="s1070">American authorities stopped the process of unlimited emigration, acceptance of people in the United States, and very many people were denied in Europe.</span> <span id="s1071">They didn't get permission to enter America.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">This process didn't frighten us very much.</span> <span id="s1073">We were prepared to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s1074">We recognized that this is a part of ourselves.</span> <span id="s1075">This is very close to what we are thinking and feeling now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">(The process is in place.</span> <span id="s1077">You're packing up to go.</span> <span id="s1078">You've made the decision to come to Chicago.</span> <span id="s1079">What did you feel you must take with you, that you could not leave behind?</span> <span id="s1080">Your parents were coming with you at the same time?)</span> <span id="s1081">No.</span> <span id="s1082">(They came later?)</span> <span id="s1083">Yes.</span> <span id="s1084">(So you had to arrange for them?)</span> <span id="s1085">That's a difficult, special story, because when we were thinking and talking, my parents... Lilia's parents passed away, and I didn't know them, but my parents, they were not prepared.</span> <span id="s1086">They didn't think much about emigration, especially my dad.</span> <span id="s1087">You see, he is a veteran of the war.</span> <span id="s1088">He was at the northern front fighting for the country.</span> <span id="s1089">Maybe for this reason, it was difficult.</span> <span id="s1090">Of course, they are much older than we are, and it was much more difficult for them to leave and to do all things like that.</span> <span id="s1091">We tried to do everything as quickly as we could.</span> <span id="s1092">The only problem that really stopped us for threefour months was our kid.</span> <span id="s1093">I don't remember if I told you that we got permission to leave the country, and Lilia delivered the kid on the same day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">(I don't think she told me that.</span> <span id="s1095">She said she knew as soon as the baby was born... What's his name again?)</span> <span id="s1096">Boris.</span> <span id="s1097">(So Boris was born and you got the mail or the other way around?)</span> <span id="s1098">Two days later, I came to OVIR.</span> <span id="s1099">Lilia was at the hospital.</span> <span id="s1100">I came each day to know about her condition, and two days after she delivered I was at OVIR and I knew the story.</span> <span id="s1101">They told me we got permission, and if we liked we could get all documents, visas, and leave Russia as quickly as we would like.</span> <span id="s1102">But it was to some extent difficult because our kid was so small.</span> <span id="s1103">We had to wait for three or four months.</span> <span id="s1104">He was exactly four months old when we were prepared to travel with him.</span> <span id="s1105">This is part of the answer to your question what was necessary...</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">Trying to answer this question, I would prefer to divide all things into two parts: first, to tell you the truth, we had a lot of luggage.</span> <span id="s1107">I'll tell you why.</span> <span id="s1108">First of all, we have many things for a kid.</span> <span id="s1109">We had special food, like formula, but he used to eat this kind of food for four months.</span> <span id="s1110">We thought it would be difficult for him to change this type of food.</span> <span id="s1111">It was Finnish milk.</span> <span id="s1112">We didn't think it would be very good to change.</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">(This was after Chernobyl.</span> <span id="s1114">The accident happened in April, 1986.</span> <span id="s1115">Were you worried about the milk and food supply your baby would get if it came from Russia?)</span> <span id="s1116">Maybe not very much, because we lived in Moscow, and northern parts of Russia didn't suffer much.</span> <span id="s1117">(Did you check the source of your food?)</span> <span id="s1118">You're right.</span> <span id="s1119">It was very important.</span> <span id="s1120">Living in Russia, you always try to get something that you can depend on.</span> <span id="s1121">But the best way to get some kind of Western food.</span> <span id="s1122">(Even before Chernobyl you felt that way.</span> <span id="s1123">.)</span> <span id="s1124">Yeah, even before.</span> <span id="s1125">Chernobyl is a long story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">(We'll get to it later.</span> <span id="s1127">So you had to get supplies for Boris?)</span> <span id="s1128">Yes.</span> <span id="s1129">There were many special things like clothing, socks, shoes.</span> <span id="s1130">You see, you need a pair of shoes for an adult and maybe ten pairs of shoes for a kid.</span> <span id="s1131">Everything.</span> <span id="s1132">(For a baby?)</span> <span id="s1133">Of course, because you need something if he's outside, if he's in his bed.</span> <span id="s1134">(All the equipment...) Right.</span> <span id="s1135">And we had a big baby stroller.</span> <span id="s1136">(And you wanted to bring that?)</span> <span id="s1137">We had to.</span> <span id="s1138">We didn't know how long we'd be there.</span> <span id="s1139">Probably it was a good idea to bring that old and absolutely awkward baby stroller, but it was very big and solid.</span> <span id="s1140">It protected the kid very good.</span> <span id="s1141">When we got to America we traveled a lot.</span> <span id="s1142">I don't remember any other period of my life when I traveled so much!</span> <span id="s1143">He was like in a small tank.</span> <span id="s1144">If you want I can show you this stroller.</span> <span id="s1145">Now it is in Chicago.</span> <span id="s1146">(For the future.)</span> <span id="s1147">We are not saving it.</span> <span id="s1148">We forgot about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">(In addition to what you needed for the baby, were there books, etc.) Then, the second part of the luggage.</span> <span id="s1150">We came to the second part of the luggage and I was absolutely lucky.</span> <span id="s1151">I don't understand how it could happen.</span> <span id="s1152">I could bring with me, take the entire archive, simply everything I had in Russia.</span> <span id="s1153">I had many books.</span> <span id="s1154">Partly we sent them to America to my friend.</span> <span id="s1155">(Technical books or your general library?)</span> <span id="s1156">I'll try to explain in details everything.</span> <span id="s1157">General books, literature, fiction, stories, novels, we sent to my friend in Philadelphia who left a year before us.</span> <span id="s1158">It was a special portion of books that I used at work that I didn't want to send by mail because Russian mail isn't very dependable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">Except this, I simply had handwritten things.</span> <span id="s1160">You cannot send handwritten things by Russian mail.</span> <span id="s1161">It is absolutely prohibited.</span> <span id="s1162">You can send it from city to city inside Russia... (When you say handwritten, do you mean that it was written by hand?)</span> <span id="s1163">Yes.</span> <span id="s1164">(Or do you mean that it was all original documents but that some of it was typed...) Handwritten.</span> <span id="s1165">I used to write everything.</span> <span id="s1166">(So this would be your experiments...) My thoughts, work that I've already finished.</span> <span id="s1167">(Like a journal...) Not a journal, because I'm not so organized to keep everything in the same journal.</span> <span id="s1168">It's papers, and all of them are separated.</span> <span id="s1169">They're collected by a clip.</span> <span id="s1170">One clip is one point.</span> <span id="s1171">(Different files.)</span> <span id="s1172">Right.</span> <span id="s1173">And I had some computer programs that I finished.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">(So you couldn't send it by mail in Russia, so you carried it with you?)</span> <span id="s1175">[laughs] Yes.</span> <span id="s1176">(And then you mailed it?)</span> <span id="s1177">Probably from Europe I could mail it, but then it was very expensive.</span> <span id="s1178">Now it costs a lot and we don't have this money.</span> <span id="s1179">You know, this process, living in Europe, we were supported by HIAS (J.A.) I forgot the name of the agency that supported us in Europe... Because we have the HIAS agency in Chicago, but we don't have J.A.</span> <span id="s1180">It operates outside of America.</span> <span id="s1181">We had enough for living, for apartment, for rent.</span> <span id="s1182">But of course not enough to send.</span> <span id="s1183">It was like four big boxes with books and papers and everything.</span> <span id="s1184">It was interesting, because I tried to put papers inside bags with clothing, with shoes, with all this stuff, and mix everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">Because you know that at customer service to leave Russia you have to show everything.</span> <span id="s1186">(At the airport?)</span> <span id="s1187">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">(At Customs, they went through everything?)</span> <span id="s1189">Absolutely everything.</span> <span id="s1190">(How long did that take?)</span> <span id="s1191">It was a long procedure.</span> <span id="s1192">(Hours?)</span> <span id="s1193">More.</span> <span id="s1194">Days.</span> <span id="s1195">But it depends.</span> <span id="s1196">Actually, it consists of three parts.</span> <span id="s1197">If you're lucky, you can try to send cargo to the place you're going if you have tickets to Vienna, you can send cargo to Vienna.</span> <span id="s1198">But I wasn't lucky, and I couldn't send cargo because at that period of time we were in a hurry to leave Russia as soon as possible.</span> <span id="s1199">So we changed tickets.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">Again, an interesting story.</span> <span id="s1201">We had tickets for Aeroflot and we changed tickets for the Austrian airplane, and I couldn't send cargo.</span> <span id="s1202">That's why we had to carry everything.</span> <span id="s1203">Of course, then, we threw out everything that wasn't absolutely necessary, and I left only books and papers.</span> <span id="s1204">(That was before you left home...) Yeah.</span> <span id="s1205">It was two, three days before leaving.</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">(Were you nervous?)</span> <span id="s1207">Yeah, we were, to some extent of course.</span> <span id="s1208">We got into an accident at the customer's house... (You got into an accident?</span> <span id="s1209">What do you mean?)</span> <span id="s1210">I was very nervous.</span> <span id="s1211">I was crying, not crying... (Yelling?)</span> <span id="s1212">Not so much, but I visited the office of the chief of the department trying to get the permission and he said it depends on the guy... not very much, but simply I tried to send cargo, but I could not.</span> <span id="s1213">(You were upset.)</span> <span id="s1214">Of course, very much.</span> <span id="s1215">(Did you actually cry?)</span> <span id="s1216">No.</span> <span id="s1217">(But you felt like crying?)</span> <span id="s1218">Not crying, but very much upset, because I realized that I should carry everything with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">(Were you angry or upset?)</span> <span id="s1220">Angry.</span> <span id="s1221">(So you lost your temper.)</span> <span id="s1222">Exactly.</span> <span id="s1223">I lost my temper.</span> <span id="s1224">(And you yelled...) Probably, yeah.</span> <span id="s1225">But now we're entering the area of minute details.</span> <span id="s1226">But right, I was angry and upset.</span> <span id="s1227">(Do you remember what you said to him?</span> <span id="s1228">Did you yell at everybody?</span> <span id="s1229">.</span> <span id="s1230">.)</span> <span id="s1231">No, I couldn't lose my temper to this extent.</span> <span id="s1232">I don't remember all details very good.</span> <span id="s1233">It's not a very interesting story.</span> <span id="s1234">I'd like to finish the story, maybe it's not very important, but simply interesting details of the process that these people had to pass through the process to leave the country.</span> <span id="s1235">First, cargo.</span> <span id="s1236">If you would be lucky to send it, then you do, if not, you don't.</span> <span id="s1237">Then, before the day that you have airplane, you can pass through Customs offices.</span> <span id="s1238">You should show your luggage, just open all bags, all boxes, all things you have and show everything.</span> <span id="s1239">They have a great list of shortages, of things that are restricted, that you can't take out, or if you can, you cannot take out two things, you can take only one of this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">(Did you have any such things?)</span> <span id="s1241">Of course.</span> <span id="s1242">For instance, there are two different types of things.</span> <span id="s1243">Let's say golden ring or earrings or maybe chains things that belong to women.</span> <span id="s1244">Or silver spoons, forks for table these things are prohibited.</span> <span id="s1245">(You had such things packed?)</span> <span id="s1246">No, they shouldn't be packed.</span> <span id="s1247">(So you didn't bring such things.)</span> <span id="s1248">We didn't bring them at that moment.</span> <span id="s1249">We didn't bring all things the day before.</span> <span id="s1250">But when you pass through Customs house, you cannot take your handwritings.</span> <span id="s1251">Handwritings are prohibited at all.</span> <span id="s1252">That's nothing to talk about forever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">(How do you explain that?)</span> <span id="s1254">In Russia... (I haven't heard of this before.)</span> <span id="s1255">That's really strange, maybe because you didn't ask anybody.</span> <span id="s1256">(So if you had collected letters that you'd received from friends...) No, no.</span> <span id="s1257">You have to forget about this.</span> <span id="s1258">Leave everything.</span> <span id="s1259">(If you kept a diary and they saw you had a diary, they wouldn't let you take that?</span> <span id="s1260">A journal...) Right.</span> <span id="s1261">No.</span> <span id="s1262">It is not possible, none of them.</span> <span id="s1263">Probably you can try to do this.</span> <span id="s1264">You have to show your journal, your register, your diary, to officers, and then it is their choice to make a decision.</span> <span id="s1265">They could look through everything, read it, and come to a decision.</span> <span id="s1266">Or if he would find something, or not like your face, then forget about it.</span> <span id="s1267">It's up to his personality to give permission or not.</span> <span id="s1268">And why the concern with handwritings?</span> <span id="s1269">Because Russians are always afraid that somebody could take secrets out of Russia and bring them to different countries, to their enemies, and Russia could lose their priority or treasure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">This is again an interesting point that delves deeply into the Russian ideology everything belongs to the State.</span> <span id="s1271">You do not have your own property, your private property.</span> <span id="s1272">This is something that appeared in Russia only during the last year.</span> <span id="s1273">And even during the last year they started to talk about this.</span> <span id="s1274">They started to think about laws about private property.</span> <span id="s1275">Before that, it was an absolutely awful thing: everything belongs to the State.</span> <span id="s1276">Then the State makes the decision to give you permission or not.</span> <span id="s1277">Everything belongs to the State.</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">And this is the story that happened with our family Bible, or better to say to Bible, but Chumash.</span> <span id="s1279">Just two months before we left it was a law that you had to get special permission to take each book with you.</span> <span id="s1280">And if your book was old enough, published maybe before the war, before 1947, then you wouldn't be able to get permission, or if it's a really special case, you have to worry about that, and it's a very big headache, and so on.</span> <span id="s1281">Our Chumash was published... By the way, I realized that it was old, but only in America, whereas it was published in 1898, and I couldn't [take it out].</span> <span id="s1282">They couldn't get us permission.</span> <span id="s1283">My parents tried, and they couldn't.</span> <span id="s1284">Nobody gave them permission because they thought that it was a treasure and it should belong to Russia.</span> <span id="s1285">It's an interesting story.</span> <span id="s1286">It's a bilingual Chumash, Russian and Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1287">It's an absolutely Jewish book.</span> <span id="s1288">It is written on the first page, "For use by Jews."</span> <span id="s1289">Despite this fact, they wouldn't let us... [laughs] (Where it published?)</span> <span id="s1290">Maybe in the Ukraine, maybe in Poland.</span> <span id="s1291">But if you come to our home I will show you.</span> <span id="s1292">I'm sure there are people in America who know more about this book and who would be able to tell me something, if it's valuable.</span> <span id="s1293">But the end of the story... My parents could not...</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">(Your parents weren't allowed to leave.</span> <span id="s1295">Your books couldn't leave... What about your friends?)</span> <span id="s1296">Almost all of them who wanted to come to America were gone.</span> <span id="s1297">Our friends in America, better to say, our new friends that we found here in America, they're Americans her aunt visited Russia last summer.</span> <span id="s1298">We asked her to meet Lilia's friend in Russia.</span> <span id="s1299">She was prepared for this operation, committed by Lilia.</span> <span id="s1300">She organized all of it.</span> <span id="s1301">That lady in Russia brought the book to the American lady, and the American lady brought it here through Customs.</span> <span id="s1302">(They didn't check her the same way...) Probably.</span> <span id="s1303">Probably they asked her, and she said it was her own book.</span> <span id="s1304">But they didn't check her.</span> <span id="s1305">Of course, she was American.</span> <span id="s1306">They didn't check her so thoroughly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">To finish this story, I'd like to say that the third stage when you are exactly leaving Russia, when you are coming through not only Customs house, but military persons who are checking all your visas and documents, at that moment they are checking absolutely everything you have with you.</span> <span id="s1308">For instance, they didn't allow me to take my stamp collection, but I wasn't worried about that thing.</span> <span id="s1309">It's a tiny thing forget about it.</span> <span id="s1310">But an interesting thing now it's interesting, but at that moment it was absolutely awful we had the baby stroller, and our baby was sleeping.</span> <span id="s1311">Fifteen to twenty minutes before this procedure he fell asleep.</span> <span id="s1312">And I asked them to leave him not to touch the kid, not to touch the baby stroller because he was sleeping, and it would be a bad thing.</span> <span id="s1313">They refused, and they started this procedure of checking everything inside the baby stroller.</span> <span id="s1314">(You had to take the baby out...) Of course.</span> <span id="s1315">We had to wake him up.</span> <span id="s1316">He started to cry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">(How old was he?)</span> <span id="s1318">Four months old.</span> <span id="s1319">(What is his birthday?)</span> <span id="s1320">28th of September, and we left the country on the 29th of January.</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">He started to cry and he was crying for three hours, until we reached Vienna.</span> <span id="s1322">That was absolutely awful.</span> <span id="s1323">I don't know what they were looking for gold, something secret.</span> <span id="s1324">Do you know the term that we use to call this last procedure we call it "the last piece of Soviet Russia".</span> <span id="s1325">Something that I will remember probably forever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">(How many hours do you think you spent there that day?)</span> <span id="s1327">I spent more than a day, because first they checked the luggage.</span> <span id="s1328">They started at night.</span> <span id="s1329">It was very many hours.</span> <span id="s1330">And then we had to come home and bring family and bring the rest of the things my wife and kid.</span> <span id="s1331">Then we were waiting in a long queue, a long line.</span> <span id="s1332">It took completely, probably a day.</span> <span id="s1333">More than 24 hours I wasn't sleeping.</span> <span id="s1334">Believe me, it's a long and difficult procedure.</span> <span id="s1335">But you see, I didn't know anybody for whom it was an obstacle.</span> <span id="s1336">This procedure isn't an obstacle.</span> <span id="s1337">If you're afraid of this procedure, then you have a different choice.</span> <span id="s1338">You can leave everything.</span> <span id="s1339">You can take just your passports, visas and bags with some necessary things, and that's it.</span> <span id="s1340">This is not an obstacle.</span></p></body></html>
