and they had a house quite near us where about thirty people were hidden.</span> <span id="s296">All her family were there.</span> <span id="s297">And it was very strange, because uh he said to me, "Do you have any work?"</span> <span id="s298">I said, "Oh, there is nothing to draw."</span> <span id="s299">I was drawing.</span> <span id="s300">It was in my papers that it was...how do you call it?</span> <span id="s301">Graphics.</span> <span id="s302">He said, "No, I don't mean that.</span> <span id="s303">I mean, of course, are you still doing something in dance?"</span> <span id="s304">I said, "How do you know that you're...that I'm a dancer?"</span> <span id="s305">And he said, "My wife is a dancer, too; and she saw you many times in, here in [Hausen (ph)] walking."</span> <span id="s306">And then afterwards I met her; and we took the vitality to, to rent a studio in a nearby city, near my village, and we went to train there for a while.</span> <span id="s307">And then they were uh, um...they were all taken away by Germans, of course.</span> <span id="s308">It was somewhat</span></p> <p><span id="s309">.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: Who was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A: Who did that?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: Who...who was taken away?</span> <span id="s313">A: The whole family.</span> <span id="s314">All of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: The family that you...you were living with in that town?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: No.</span> <span id="s317">Well, I was dancing only with this one woman.</span> <span id="s318">And I never saw the other ones who lived in that house.</span> <span id="s319">I never came to that house, only a few moments.</span> <span id="s320">And I had the luck there that this woman had said to me, "If there is something wrong with your bike, or something else, we always know people who can make it all right."</span> <span id="s321">And so one day we had given...on a Friday night, we took our bikes there and we could get them on Monday; and we had given them books to read and they had given us books to read.</span> <span id="s322">We were on the...on the verge of uh going there to fetch books and the bikes; and we were outside and I said to the woman...I wasn't living..."Let us wait for the postman."</span> <span id="s323">He was in the house nearby.</span> <span id="s324">And the postman said, "Well, you have heard about it?"</span> <span id="s325">That the Germans are at this moment in the house where they are.</span> <span id="s326">So then I went...we went back.</span> <span id="s327">And I had to leave this house, of course, because...because it was too dangerous.</span> <span id="s328">Perhaps they found out letters or....</span> <span id="s329">And so I..</span> <span id="s330">.</span> <span id="s331">I didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s332">And I had met just, before I went away from Amsterdam...I uh had a lunch with friends--an actor and and friend of his who was student in [Maarthen (ph)]--and they was having lunch with me, in the Jewish part of the town, of course.</span> <span id="s333">And then we were having luncheon; and I don't know why but I had all the family silver... the forks and spoons and..., and then soon there was a ring at the door.</span> <span id="s334">You can't imagine it now.</span> <span id="s335">And there were two very uh, well, violent persons and they came to fetch the silver...</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: ?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: Yeah...Anaz...Nazis, of course.</span> <span id="s338">And they were very polite.</span> <span id="s339">And I said, "Well, they are all on the table.</span> <span id="s340">Take it away."</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: How did they know it was there?</span> <span id="s342">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: How did they know it was there?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: I couldn't tell you.</span> <span id="s345">They just tried, perhaps; or they knew from someone.</span> <span id="s346">And then this student boy, this...certainly he was--his wife was his screen...he said to me when they left, "If ever you are in trouble, you can...here is my phone number in [Maarthen (ph)], where I live."</span> <span id="s347">And at that time...I mean.... '44, '43...I phone him.</span> <span id="s348">And he said, "Well, come to me."</span> <span id="s349">And I stayed with him for a fortnight, and everything was clear again; and afterwards he came to us, when they started to go after the students.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: And what was it like when you stayed with him for a fortnight?</span> <span id="s351">A: Well, excellent.</span> <span id="s352">We had a nice time together.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: The entire time that you were in hiding, you had false identification papers.</span> <span id="s354">Did you have to hide?</span> <span id="s355">You mentioned that you go out for walks with the other ?</span> <span id="s356">Were you able to be seen in public?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s358">I went everywhere.</span> <span id="s359">I went even to a performance in a nearby city of the company where I was in; and it was a little bit stupid, but nothing happened.</span> <span id="s360">And uh I went shopping.</span> <span id="s361">And nobody paid any attention to me, ever.</span> <span id="s362">And only when there was a razzia in this...in the village, in the street where I lived, and I was uh....</span> <span id="s363">Well, we lived in a nice house, a nice villa; and uh next to us there were two...a German brother and sister lived there.</span> <span id="s364">But they were already for thirty or forty years in Holland, and never spoke German.</span> <span id="s365">And in the morning, at seven o'clock in the morning, suddenly I heard that they were speaking German; and I said to the woman...I said, "Please go and have a look."</span> <span id="s366">And she went out to have a look, and she...she said to me...she made a sign; and we had a marvelous hiding place in the house.</span> <span id="s367">And I went there in two minutes.</span> <span id="s368">And then they came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: Who came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: The Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: Where were you hiding in the house at the time?</span> <span id="s372">A: Under the floor.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: What happened when the Germans came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: Well, they were...looked everywhere but they didn't find me and they didn't find anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">They didn't...by, by sheer luck, they didn't find even my uh, my uh clothes.</span> <span id="s376">They were hidden every night away in a.... And then I heard them come in to the uh bathroom, but it was so nice and so well done that they couldn't imagine that there was an entrance to the, uh under the floor; so I laid there down.</span> <span id="s377">It was all over with, with blankets and everything.</span> <span id="s378">And after a while I heard this woman laughing with them outside because she was glad that they were outside... out of the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: Was that where you would have to stay most of the time, under the floor?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: Never...no, no.</span> <span id="s381">I had only been for for two hours... never again.</span> <span id="s382">I never...I never hid.</span> <span id="s383">I think the best thing was not to hide.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: And at this time did you hear anything from your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s386">Yes.</span> <span id="s387">My sister, my second sister, was uh hidden in the north of the country.</span> <span id="s388">And they escaped from the Germans, also by a good hiding place;
