organizations.</span> <span id="s733">SO many years ago I joined because you know, I had a feeling for survivors.</span> <span id="s734">I mean, but of course, it’s not the same thing.</span> <span id="s735">You see, I am a survivor, but I was never in a camp.</span> <span id="s736">When you are a Holocaust survivor, usually you were a survivor in a camp.</span> <span id="s737">Like that rabbi

Auschwitz, he was 11 years old when he was deported to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s742">I mean, it’s terrible thing.</span> <span id="s743">But, my life, in a way, in spite of everything, I led a very protective life whenever I think back.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">WH: Well, that’s a curious point to me.</span> <span id="s745">My parents lived in Paris and fled to Marseilles. . .</span></p> <p><span id="s746">VS: Listen, I was young, I really didn’t know my father that well.</span> <span id="s747">Because he was taken -42.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">WH: Well, I think maybe protected, but still –</span></p> <p><span id="s749">VS: Well, compared to the American kid you know, who had never been to Europe, my life was torn – and, you know, exposed to danger and things like that.</span> <span id="s750">But, -to be freezing in Auschwitz you know, and trying to, I mean, when you see the rows of beds, you know, bunk beds, and the faces of people, and – I was far from that.</span> <span id="s751">You know, so you feel also, I mean, not guilty, I mean, your happy that you didn’t go though that, but at the same time, if you’re honest, you cannot put yourself in the same category.</span> <span id="s752">I mean, (inaudible)</span></p> <p><span id="s753">WH: Except to know that had you been caught that this would have happened also.</span></p> <p><span

(inaudible –voice over ?</span> <span id="s759">could have been dead?)</span> <span id="s760">a long time ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">WH: it’s interesting to me to hear you say that, because actually, considering the fact that you’re very much a survivor in another sense, in the sense that your father did not make it through (inaudible) and he was in Auschwitz and that’s far removed from an American Jew’s experience</span></p> <p><span id="s762">VS: That’s for sure.</span> <span id="s763">Well - .</span></p> <p><span id="s764">WH: Do you think that Americans can –do you ever have a feeling that they really can’t have an appreciation or understanding of what happened in Europe.</span> <span id="s765">I mean, American Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">VS: If they did not have a personal experience, certainly not.</span> <span id="s767">If they came here and they had relatives who remained and either died or whatever or perished in camps.</span> <span id="s768">So, they’ll say it, or they hide it because it’s also you know, it’s unpleasant to (inaudible, ?</span> <span id="s769">mention?)</span> <span id="s770">with all the psychological about the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">WH: And what about that whole business, that books came out and people said the American Jews knew what was going on, the leadership knew and didn’t do anything about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">VS: (inaudible) there is something to it.</span> <span id="s773">I mean, nobody wanted to be bothered with an influx of immigration and so on during those years.</span> <span id="s774">Roosevelt, and I mean, we learned it all afterwards, you know, we didn’t – I mean, we come from Europe.</span> <span id="s775">We didn’t know that, that we were not wanted.</span> <span id="s776">That nobody bothered.</span> <span id="s777">We thought that the German power was so tremendous that NOBODY could come in and help us, pull us out of there, you see.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">WH: That’s a curious thing to me.</span> <span id="s779">Did you – do you –ever feel, I mean, now that Hitler didn’t win, we know he didn’t win, but in 1942, you didn’t know what would happen.</span> <span id="s780">Did you imagine, did you think to yourself, how would we be able to go on if Hitler wins the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">VS: Listen, we lived from day to day.</span> <span id="s782">And that was it.</span> <span id="s783">In those days it was really the middle of the war.</span> <span id="s784">You couldn’t, you didn’t – there was no way out.</span> <span id="s785">There was, you know, the Germans were everywhere.</span> <span id="s786">And they made the rules, and –but again, by coming to Sweden and I saw, you know, the other side of life there.</span> <span id="s787">There the Jews were very concerned.</span> <span id="s788">I mean, that was – and I immediately joined the Zionist group there and, -so we knew what was going on.</span> <span id="s789">See, at least the news reached Sweden about the war and many, there were many prisoners who escaped to Sweden that were people from concentration camps.</span> <span id="s790">I don’t know how, but they got on a ship someway, you know, through Hamburg, on the Swedish ship, they were hiding you know, in the bottom of the ship.</span> <span id="s791">And they jumped out (inaudible) and started swimming.</span> <span id="s792">You know.</span> <span id="s793">And came to shore and were picked up by somebody who then helped them to – many arrived in Stockholm.</span> <span id="s794">I remember there was a concert hall in Stockholm, they rebuilt it now, so now I think it’s fresh, but in those days it had steps, -you know, very wide and the whole length of the concert hall and it was facing the sun during the day, so that if you sat there from 11 until 2 the sunshine in Sweden, which is a big thing you know, and that was a meeting place for all the refugees.</span> <span id="s795">It was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s796">All you had to do was to come there, at lunch time, and always here, you know, this camp, news from a camp, you know.</span> <span id="s797">Somebody who escaped they were from Palestine, like the (?</span> <span id="s798">Hannah?)</span> <span id="s799">who was (inaudible -?</span> <span id="s800">dropped?)</span> <span id="s801">into Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s802">And others who somehow were dropped you know into Swedish territory and then came out to talk about it and the organization that I was involved in, I mean, that was really the Jewish intelligence, you know, in Sweden, everybody came to us and relayed it, and told us and so on.</span> <span id="s803">And we helped them.</span> <span id="s804">And, for instances, -later on, towards Israel’s independence, the Hagganah people came to Sweden and brought arms, and got money, you know, (inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s805">WH: When you were here in the early years, did you have friends who had come over from Europe at the same time?</span></p> <p><span id="s806">VS: From (inaudible) what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s807">WH: Well, in ’47, ’48 (inaudible)</span></p> <p><span id="s808">VS: I was very involved then, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">WH: But did you have friends who came from Europe at the same time . . . let’s put it another way, who were your friends when you first came.</span> <span id="s810">I mean, you didn’t know English that well, right, you weren’t Americanized.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">VS: No, but I –did not create a non-American crowd you see.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">WH: There was such a thing - .</span></p> <p><span id="s813">VS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s814">There were (?)</span> <span id="s815">but I was – no, at the U.N. there was so many people there, you now, I got to know South Americas, and – France I have a lot of.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">WH: You sort of looked into it before that you, you said that it’s amazing when you think of “all the coincidences that happened in my life,” do you ever feel that in some unexplainable way that, in way you led a charmed life in terms of your own survival and in coming here and all the things that happened to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s817">VS: Charmed?</span> <span id="s818">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">WH: Do you believe in some higher (inaudible) anything like that ?</span></p> <p><span id="s820">VS: It depends when you believe.</span> <span id="s821">If you believe beforehand that it should happen, that’s one thing.</span> <span id="s822">But when you look back, and you know, it - .</span></p> <p><span id="s823">WH: I guess my question, what I’m really getting at is really a theological –</span></p> <p><span id="s824">VS: Well, listen, I said I was a very lucky person.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">WH: Well, a lot of people raise a question, and I don’t ask it only to Rabbi’s or to Hasidic Jews, there’s a whole question of it there is a God and if there’s something special about being Jewish, or anything, how is it, how did this all happen?</span> <span id="s826">Do you ever ask that question?</span></p> <p><span id="s827">VS: Well, that goes without saying, but I don’t invest all my beliefs in, you know, God.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">WH: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">VS: Destiny.</span> <span id="s830">You know.</span> <span id="s831">Luck, and whatever.</span> <span id="s832">I mean, you have to be what you are.</span> <span id="s833">You’re Jewish, you’re Jewish.</span> <span id="s834">So, lets not talk about being something else.</span> <span id="s835">So, you make the best of it.</span> <span id="s836">Not everything’s perfect.</span> <span id="s837">And then there are those who saw, “How could God?”</span> <span id="s838">Listen, there was a Hitler, God was not going to prevent Hitler from doing what he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">WH: Well, there are people who have given up their faith for precisely the reason that you just mentioned.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">WH: Are you saying that you know if they ever had it?</span></p> <p><span id="s841">VS: it’s not that.</span> <span id="s842">It’s hard giving up faith.</span> <span id="s843">I mean, what do you expect from your faith.</span> <span id="s844">You know, only goodness and candies and so on?</span> <span id="s845">The, -it’s a cop-out, you know, to blame it all on God.</span> <span id="s846">Or to change, you think that it makes any different if you – I, you invite different source if you become something else.</span> <span id="s847">You cannot become.</span> <span id="s848">You are what you are.</span> <span id="s849">You know, here we relate because there is a similarity between our lives and, or, background, or whatever.</span> <span id="s850">It’s something that bring - , that puts us together.</span> <span id="s851">You can talk to somebody else, who doesn’t have the same background, you may find later someone, but who’s better or who’s worse.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">WH: Well, I interviewed an author the day, his name is Leon Wells, and he said that . . . “God, if you decided in your infinite wisdom that we should all die, okay!</span> <span id="s853">. . . but why did you have to kill us like this?</span> <span id="s854">Why did we have to die like this?”</span></p> <p><span id="s855">VS: Did he get an answer?</span></p> <p><span id="s856">WH: Well, you see, I have met people in the course of this project, and before it, who’s beliefs were strengthen almost by having gone through this experience and still being alive at the end of it, and other people have said, “Well, a God that would allow women and children to be killed like this, especially to those who when we told them to believe in Him, I can’t believe.”</span> <span id="s857">There are very difficult questions.</span> <span id="s858">You know, I don’t - .</span></p> <p><span id="s859">VS: There are no answers to them.</span> <span id="s860">And, uh, -</span></p> <p><span id="s861">WH: Okay, -.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">VS: So, that’s it?</span></p> <p><span id="s863">WH: That’s plenty.</span> <span id="s864">That’s plenty.</span> <span id="s865">Yes.</span> <span id="s866">I - End of
