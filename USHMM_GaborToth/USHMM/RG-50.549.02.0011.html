Sarnee, that’s in the Ukraine.</span> <span id="s20">And it was Poland before, up til 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: We got a pretty good sense from the first interview about what happened when the Russian occupation of Sarnee began in 1939 and then subsequently the German occupation happened and you mentioned a little bit about your life before all of the horror began.</span> <span id="s22">But -- but let’s go back even farther than that and I’d like to hear something about your family background, your -- your father’s name and his occupation, let’s start there.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: My father’s name was Samuel Schier.</span> <span id="s24">His occupation, I call it a forester, but actually, in -- in the direct translation, is -- he was a selector of woods.</span> <span id="s25">He used to buy quartels -- quartels, like oh -- of woods and then cut them down in the summer and then ship them during the winter, into town.</span> <span id="s26">And this was seasonal work, like -- seasonal work.</span> <span id="s27">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: So the wood -- go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: The wood was used locally or did it -- was it shipped all over the place?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: No, the was -- is shipped to w -- to Sarnee, to the city of Sarnee, the sleds in the winter, when the snows would start.</span> <span id="s32">The p -- the village people, he would arrange so that the village people would take the woods and take him to Sarnee.</span> <span id="s33">And in Sarnee they would cut them, I don’t know how they would cut them, then ship them overseas.</span> <span id="s34">Some went even to Germany, some went to the Baltic and as far as I know, as far as I could understand at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: What was your mother’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: My mother’s name was Leah Bourka.</span> <span id="s37">And she was born actually in the outskirts of Sarnee.</span> <span id="s38">She was not the -- lived like in a village.</span> <span id="s39">My grandmother, my -- my -- and my mother was born there, as far as I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: Was your family living in -- in the s -- the area of Sarnee for many generations before your parents?</span> <span id="s41">Had -- were your parents born there and their parents or what -- what was the history of your family in that area?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: As far as I know, I can -- I can recall there was -- it’s hundreds and hundreds of years.</span> <span id="s43">My parents, my grandparents, there hundreds of years I can tra -- they say maybe 800, who knows?</span> <span id="s44">800 or more.</span> <span id="s45">Many, many years, as far as I know.</span> <span id="s46">So my parent, my -- my family did not immigrated from no place.</span> <span id="s47">They were living and we were Polish, like I say.</span> <span id="s48">We were Polish nationals.</span> <span id="s49">Except our religion divided because it was predominantly Catholic in our country and that’s what divided us.</span> <span id="s50">That’s nothing, nothing else.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: Was your family very religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: No, my family was not.</span> <span id="s53">My mother was more religious than my father.</span> <span id="s54">My father was a very modern man.</span> <span id="s55">He used to travel in his youth a lot.</span> <span id="s56">He spoke a fluent Russian.</span> <span id="s57">He went -- they were -- I understand they were well-to-do, way, way back, before the Communists came to power.</span> <span id="s58">And -- and they sized a lody of their property and when they bo -- when the -- the Communists took over them, th-they -- the cover -- they took cover in the -- Russia -- they lived right on someplace in Orlefsk, as far as I know, from whatever my family told me.</span> <span id="s59">And then they capen -- they came and they settled near -- not far from Sarnee.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: What were the names -- you mentioned that you had four siblings, your four brothers and sisters, what were their names and their -- and their ages in relation to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: No, I had -- no, I had one brother, who was I would say five or six and my sister was a year -- a year and a half younger.</span> <span id="s62">So he was six, he just started -- maybe started school and my little sister was like three and a half -- three and a half, no more.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: Are you talking about when the war started that’s -- that’s how old they were?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: Y-Yeah.</span></p> <p><span

talking like in ‘41.</span> <span id="s69">So my little brother was, let’s say six -- six, seven, he just started school, so I’m an -- I’m not sure d -- six or seven.</span> <span id="s70">My little sister was a few years younger than he.</span> <span id="s71">His name was Shawlinkay and her name was Esther.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: And he was the young -- he was the youngest, your little brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: No, Estheka was the youngest, my -- my sister was the youngest.</span> <span id="s74">Survived from my family was my sister and myself.</span></p> <p><span

Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: Two sisters and a brother.</span> <span id="s79">One sister survived, escaped the same day I did and my brother and sister perished, including my parents, grandparents and the rest of the family, cousins and whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: What was the name of your sister who survived and how old was she?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: Simma was approximately -- Simma was -- it was in -- in 1941 -- in 1941 -- we are different in -- in seven years.</span> <span id="s82">So in 1941, when she escaped, she was a young kid.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: In 1941, you would have been about 16?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: 16, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: So she would have been about nine years old?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: Maybe 10, let’s say 10, something like that.</span> <span id="s87">And she’s the only one who survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: Before the Russian occupation, you mentioned in the first interview that you had been attending school and that you had dreams of becoming a professional and -- tell me a little bit more about your -- your educational experience and your hopes before the war began.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: My hopes -- we were not a well-to-do family, but I went to a private school and I remember it was -- Hebrew was taken and then the Polish language.</span> <span id="s90">It was a parochial school.</span> <span id="s91">And I went to that school with ock Hebrew, with th-the Polish language like I said, and my -- my vision was -- I already had my dreams.</span> <span id="s92">I wanted to go to school, to -- I didn’t know how in -- in how I’m -- I’m going to achieve it, but as a young kid I already was thinking -- I even was thinking maybe I’ll go to a kibbutz and I’ll go to Palestine on that time.</span> <span id="s93">It was something -- it was a big movement of Zionist -- a Zionist movement was in our part of the country and in my city.</span> <span id="s94">And some of my family went at that time, like my aunt went to Palestine at that time, in her -- thir -- in the 30’s.</span> <span id="s95">My uncle and another aunt, two aunts, another two aunts on my father’s side, they went to -- to Palestine.</span> <span id="s96">So I had in my mind said, “Maybe if I will not be able to proceed with my education down there, my parents will not be able to -- to afford it, so I’ll go to Palestine and maybe down there I’ll proceed, or whatever it is necessary to do.”</span> <span id="s97">But -- and then -- and then you are asking me about before the war, correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s100">So this is -- was up til 1939, I went to this school.</span> <span id="s101">And then when the Soviets -- when the Soviets came, in 1939, the a -- the war started with us and -- and as we know it from history, my country was divided.</span> <span id="s102">Poland was divided.</span> <span id="s103">The pact between the Germans and the -- and the Russian was made and I fell under the jurisdiction of the Soviets and I went to school, proceeded school and the Russian, they call it a dishiturletka.</span> <span id="s104">This is equivalent to a -- a high school, but maybe in a higher -- something on this nature, in a different, you know.</span> <span id="s105">I went to this Russian school and two years after the war started with -- with the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: So you were -- were you learning Russian at that time --</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: Russian --</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: Or had you already spoken --</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: Yes, I knew the lang -- I knew Ukrainian a little.</span> <span id="s110">But Russian was -- came very fast to me because I -- I heard around me -- a lot of people spoke do -- th-the language, so it was easy for me to -- to get to know the language and I did it very fast -- I did it -- I did it fast.</span> <span id="s111">And I spoke the language pretty good.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: Did your family -- what language did your family speak at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: Our family spoke Yiddish -- spoke Yiddish amongs -- yeah my father and mother and they spoke to the kids also in Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: And were you -- did you have a very close family relationship?</span> <span id="s115">Were -- were you particularly close?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: Very.</span> <span id="s117">Yes.</span> <span id="s118">I think we had a very cr-close relation -- lot of laughing, lot of -- a lot of affection for my parents, for my father, for my mother.</span> <span id="s119">And we were a very, very close knit family.</span> <span id="s120">And I felt it.</span> <span id="s121">And this maybe sa -- maybe this is also -- was a factor for my survival, too.</span> <span id="s122">I never regretted something, whatever I saw around me and I saw the people the way they live in their -- in -- in -- I -- I just said, “Let me get over the war.”</span> <span id="s123">And I wanted to continue and I wanted to do the way I remember was taught in my family.</span> <span id="s124">If we told the propaganda what the Germans tried to against the Jews, it did not penetrate to me, it did not.</span> <span id="s125">Because it didn’t mean anything, I didn’t -- I didn’t identify with nothing.</span> <span id="s126">I saw it just all -- all -- all created.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: You mentioned that your father was an interpreter during World War One and -- and he spoke -- didn’t you mention that?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: That he spoke German?</span> <span id="s130">Did he have a close relation -- did he think of the Germans as being capable of -- of what they did?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: No, my father was a interpreter during -- as far as I -- I remember he told us.</span> <span id="s132">He was a interpreter during the second World War and he spoke fluent German.</span> <span id="s133">He said they are very [indecipherable] --</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: Do you mean the f -- the -- do you mean the first World War?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: Yeah, the first World War, yeah.</span> <span id="s136">He spoke a fluent German and he was a interpreter and he said the Germans are very civilized people, they are -- it’s propaganda.</span> <span id="s137">He said he didn’t believe in that.</span> <span id="s138">And the thing they did, happened what happened.</span> <span id="s139">It was horrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: One more question about the pre-war experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: I think from listening to your first interview I get an inkling that -- you had a very strong character as a -- as a very young girl, that you had -- that you had that.</span> <span id="s143">People -- you mentioned a couple of times that people told you that you were fast and you were quick and you make it and you could escape.</span> <span id="s144">I’d like you to des-describe yourself at that age.</span> <span id="s145">What kind of a little -- what kind of a child were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: I would call myself very independent.</span> <span id="s147">And it were times when I tr -- when I -- you know, I used to go out from the ghetto on my own risk.</span> <span id="s148">I used to take off the piece of junk, the piece of rag from my front and the back, whatever it was and I used to run out from the ghetto and I free -- I have a free spirit, I -- I -- I hated it to being closed in there in the ghet -- I hated it And it’s -- the first -- any chance.</span> <span id="s149">And I even had the idea -- I was toying with the idea to ran away from the ghetto, to escape.</span> <span id="s150">I didn’t know where, but I wanted to go away and escape into the woods someplace.</span> <span id="s151">But I was afraid because if I would escape, my family would be murdered right there and then.</span> <span id="s152">And that’s how they kept me down there -- sitting down there.</span> <span id="s153">I didn’t know for sure if I’ll escape I’ll survive someplace.</span> <span id="s154">Maybe somebody will denounce me in -- in britally Germans.</span> <span id="s155">But the other thing, the -- the -- the other thing kept me -- kept me -- they shouldn’t take revenge on my family and that’s what kept us together.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: Will you say something about the town of Sarnee and the relationship between the Jews and -- and non-Jews in the area?</span> <span id="s157">Did you perceive any anti-Semitism before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: There was some, some, but they did not exactly affect it.</span> <span id="s159">There’s some outburst and some -- from the schools, from the Polish schools, there were -- they were created and they were become Fascists and it was a big influx out already from Germany, I think it was a import from there and it has -- and right away this start, derogatory word against the Jews and this and that but it’s not affect us physically or any of this -- of this nature and I went to a Hebrew school predominantly, mostly the m -- the -- the -- the students are Jewi -- of -- of Jewish -- of Jewish faith.</span> <span id="s160">So it did not exactly affected me, but some kids who went to Polish schools, I think it affected them more than affected me.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: Did you have friends who were -- who were Polish Catholics?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: Yes, I had friends, I had friends who were Polish Catholics and especially during the Russian, when the Russian came and I went to this -- I’m sorry -- and I went to this Russian school.</span> <span id="s163">So I had a lody of my friends were of -- of Greek Orthodox, there is a lot of people who -- down there in my part of the country they Greek or Orthodox or they’re of Catholic persuasion.</span> <span id="s164">So I had from wode to you know, some of Catholics, something I didn’t ask exactly who was what, because it didn’t matter.</span> <span id="s165">But I had a lot of friends who were non -- who were non-Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: Did their attitudes towards you change after the Russian occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: Not after the Russian occupation, but with the Germans.</span> <span id="s168">After the -- when the Russian occupation was -- was you know, equality was then -- then -- you know, you are -- everybody supposedly, you know, the minority, the -- we didn’t have no problems at that time.</span> <span id="s169">We went to school together, we went and -- and was every -- ev -- it was very, very nice and very, very congenial.</span> <span id="s170">But when the Germans came, it changed completely.</span> <span id="s171">Some of my friends became not friends.</span> <span id="s172">They would see us and they would turn -- oh, I don’t know, they were intimidated or they were afraid or they didn’t want to get involved, I don’t know which way.</span> <span id="s173">And we didn’t -- we didn’t proceed to -- to ask any question, because you know, we were like prisoners in our own city, in our own country.</span> <span id="s174">And we were closed in in these ghettos, but absolutely a change.</span> <span id="s175">Our neighbors -- our neighbors looked away from us, because when I lived in the ghetto, we had a lody non-Jewish neighbors, they were Christians, who stayed in the ghetto, they didn’t had to move out, stayed in the ghetto and before we were friendly neighbors, we said hello, hi, this, that and right when the Germans came, and the -- and the import of this venom came, right away they changed their attitude.</span> <span id="s176">Some of them joined this -- this evil ca -- this evil German, the -- their Fascist groups and -- and it changed their attitude.</span> <span id="s177">But this was the lesser tragedies, you know, what had befallen the -- our people in our -- and my people from my town.</span> <span id="s178">And that’s what I -- I -- I can think of this -- of this -- actually of this -- of this m -- of this minute.</span> <span id="s179">We had a lot of friends that -- see a girl who worked for us -- I remember she used to be working, she was a -- some maid, was working, but she’s a orphan.</span> <span id="s180">And I remember my mother actually married her off.</span> <span id="s181">And she used to call my mother ‘mother’.</span> <span id="s182">She liked my mother because she gave her a dowry and she married her off to a very nice guy and sh-she didn’t had nobody.</span> <span id="s183">And when the Germans came, her husband came and he warned, actually, my family.</span> <span id="s184">He came into the ghetto and he said to my father, “Remember, you know I hear very bad news.</span> <span id="s185">I think they are -- they are ready to kill all the Jews.”</span> <span id="s186">My father had a very tem-temper and he -- he nee -- got so upset and he actually chased him out from the house.</span> <span id="s187">He didn’t want it to believe.</span> <span id="s188">You know sometimes you just don’t want it to believe.</span> <span id="s189">You think it’s just spreading some rumors, some bate in the Germans, because [indecipherable] situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: Did your mother think differently from your father or did she go along with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: If she -- my mother -- if she thought differently, I --I never heard, she just -- she went through one World -- the first World War.</span> <span id="s192">So she thought, “Let us just go through it.”</span> <span id="s193">It’s like, we’ll go through it somehow, you know.</span> <span id="s194">And she was -- she wanted to.</span> <span id="s195">And -- and she was expecting, I guess, to go through it.</span> <span id="s196">Maybe she was on a more posit -- I don’t -- I -- I don’t -- but she did not verbally, actually talk to us.</span> <span id="s197">But she was very much worried, very much so.</span> <span id="s198">And -- and I used to go out from the ghetto, used to bring some food, on the risk of my life.</span> <span id="s199">And I told once, a little -- I -- I said I know of on the tape.</span> <span id="s200">I went out from the ghetto with my sister, we took off our rags, we went and we got some -- some blackberries and some bread, what I ask some of the peasants to give us.</span> <span id="s201">And at night when we are coming back to the ghetto, and our house was right -- we were living -- to the end we were living right by the gate -- right by the fence, not by the gate, by the fence.</span> <span id="s202">And down there, in a little -- a barn was in the -- in the -- near the house and we made a hole.</span> <span id="s203">Through this hole I used to go out to the free -- to be free.</span> <span id="s204">And then, when I wanted to go out to th -- come into the ghetto, I had to open again the hole and come in.</span> <span id="s205">And come in back to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s206">And I remember at night, I came with my sister, we came with -- I came with my sister and my -- my bag, my -- actually my -- fell on the -- on the ground.</span> <span id="s207">And a policeman was walking right in front of our house -- a -- a Ukrainian policeman was patrolling at night.</span> <span id="s208">And when my package -- I captured a package like I carried on my -- on my shoul -- on my -- on my back.</span> <span id="s209">A b -- like a -- not a backpack, but like a package.</span> <span id="s210">And I -- and it dropped on the floor.</span> <span id="s211">And he start listening and we s -- and we froze, my sister and I froze.</span> <span id="s212">And -- because we’re -- we -- we thought, that’s the end.</span> <span id="s213">We were standing down there and he listened attentively and then he went again walking and at that time, you know, my mother was standing in the window and looking and expecting us.</span> <span id="s214">If she didn’t got a heart attack at that time, it was a miracle.</span> <span id="s215">We opened the little hole, we went in.</span> <span id="s216">My mother -- I didn’t hevywith to knock at the door, my mother opened the door, very quietly and as long as these footsteps of the German -- of the Ukrainian policemens, he couldn’t hear the -- the opening or the closing of the -- of the doors.</span> <span id="s217">That’s how we went in and we brought our food, whatever -- whatever we could acquire during the day.</span> <span id="s218">On the outside we were free, on the inside we have to put again our -- our -- our rags that we are -- that we are branded for something.</span> <span id="s219">And I remember a woman, I remember before they put us in the ghetto, was a friend for us, so she came there, cried, actually.</span> <span id="s220">They were friends of ours, the -- the Ukrainian, there were some good souls.</span> <span id="s221">And they said, “You know -- you know,” to my mother, “this is a bad omen.</span> <span id="s222">They are -- they are -- they are putting you all in one -- in one -- in one place.</span> <span id="s223">This is something -- a bad sign.”</span> <span id="s224">And my mother yelled at her, said, “We will loov -- live through this too.”</span> <span id="s225">But she -- she sensed that because they went through already a war before and they knew what’s all about.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: How long did it take before the Germans put all of the Jews into this ghetto?</span> <span id="s227">How long after the German occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: Months, a few months -- a few months.</span> <span id="s229">They ask from all the villages, from all the places, all the Jews must leave their premises and come into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s230">And their orders us se -- ordered us in like -- like in -- in -- in five our -- us -- our part of the city was predominantly Jewish, all of the Jews, the rest of the Jews from these small, were crowded.</span> <span id="s231">Like I -- I had, for example, I don’t know if I said it in the tape, for example in my -- in the house where we lived, I don’t know, 12, 14 people were in there.</span> <span id="s232">They slept on the floor, slept any place we could sleep.</span> <span id="s233">And remember, at night, we used to be frightened to death because we had a curfew, at seven or eight.</span> <span id="s234">What the curfew for the Jews, nobody was allowed to go out, anybody was being caught outside strolling around, he would be shot.</span> <span id="s235">And it’s no less punishment was than that.</span> <span id="s236">But at night we used to -- we -- we lived not far our house, was not far from the gate.</span> <span id="s237">Actually when you enter the gate in the beginning.</span> <span id="s238">So some -- at night, when we used to hear some trucks would be come in to the ghetto and we didn’t know if this is they’re coming to grab some people -- to grab them from the ghetto, or te -- or to -- they are people -- actually Christians who are coming back from work.</span> <span id="s239">And we -- we heard already the truck passing by the house and going away on the -- on -- on whatever he went, we were quiet down.</span> <span id="s240">And in this manner we had to live more than a year.</span> <span id="s241">It was an eternity.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: Did you work during that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: Outside of the ghetto?</span> <span id="s245">No?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: No, during the time of the Germans?</span> <span id="s247">No.</span> <span id="s248">A few times they took us, they had to as -- they ask us to -- each family had to give a certain amount of work a week.</span> <span id="s249">A few times I went for them, silly things are done there.</span> <span id="s250">They take stones and t-take stone from one place to another one.</span> <span id="s251">All kind -- and manual work, it didn’t mean anything.</span> <span id="s252">But I remember working near a bridge and this is also -- I used to get some food, I used to go in -- in the peasant house and ask him sometimes for a piece of bread or something.</span> <span id="s253">And there were some good souls who were helping us, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: Did your parents have to work at that time, outside of the ghetto or inside?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: N-No, my father had to work as a laborer, you know.</span> <span id="s256">Let’s say -- they would assigned each houses, they -- as to come to the Unerat.</span> <span id="s257">The Unerat is the Jewish, you know, consul.</span> <span id="s258">So it’s the -- a certain amount of work each week.</span> <span id="s259">So, my father used to go down there with -- with a group of people out of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s260">And sometimes he would encounter some of his people who knew him, they loved him.</span> <span id="s261">He was known in the whole -- the whole region down there as a good man.</span> <span id="s262">And he was helping, we were ourself in artridge, he was helping some actually other -- other people.</span> <span id="s263">And when they met him, they used to take their bread and give it to him and he used to bring it to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s264">That’s how he was, well known.</span> <span id="s265">In some of the -- of the -- of the Ukrainian, they were -- and they said, “Oh God, what they are doing to you?”</span> <span id="s266">And sometimes they were coming and grabbing some of the belongings of the Jews and some of the good souls in Ukrainian used to say, “Remember,” some smart one, they said, “today them, tomorrow us.”</span> <span id="s267">And it was that way.</span> <span id="s268">And I always say, if I am in danger, remember, you are next in line,[indecipherable] if you are not doing the right thing, if you -- they are not -- the right thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: What about your other daily activities during that time that you were in the ghetto?</span> <span id="s270">What else did you do with your time?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: We used to meet friends, among friends and read, discuss things in -- discuss things, in hope.</span> <span id="s272">We still have some hopes that maybe -- we used to hear news penetrated into ghetto, that’s -- something about the Americans declaring war on Germany, something I heard in the ghetto, I don’t whether they got -- it was in ninetin not yet.</span> <span id="s273">But somehow he penetrated news to us.</span> <span id="s274">Because we were not allowed and we had no communication with the outside world at all.</span> <span id="s275">There was no radios, nothing.</span> <span id="s276">And so we did not -- but we penetrated news in this -- in this respect, that the war started.</span> <span id="s277">And also we heard about partisans, but that was everything so remote and so away that we did not believe.</span> <span id="s278">Here, with the full strength of the German, they were -- they were constantly on our -- on our back, on our things.</span> <span id="s279">We did not -- we did not -- we did not know, we just were waiting for a miracle to happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: What did you hear about the partisans?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: I heard it after I -- I -- after I read some books, that the first actually dissont was -- was throwing the -- the Soviets -- throwing in the back of my town, Sarnee -- actually the first dissont -- are organize a partisan movement, if you understand what I’m saying.</span> <span id="s282">To organize a partisan movement was not far from my city.</span> <span id="s283">We heard this, but it did not -- it did not penetrate to us.</span> <span id="s284">We knew that there were POW’s, they were escaping in the woods, but -- but it still was not clear.</span> <span id="s285">In every little thing was a hope for us, maybe, maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: How did you -- how did you feel when you heard about that kind of resistance activity?</span> <span id="s287">Did you -- did you have a strong response?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: To me it was, yes, very much.</span> <span id="s289">I was ready to escape from the ghetto, I was ready to go and to do some fighting some -- and I saw the brutality and the way they -- the way it’s happening around us, for no reason, no rhyme, no reason.</span> <span id="s290">Wrong was wrong and right was wrong.</span> <span id="s291">In -- in -- in -- in, you know, in anybody who wanted something to d -- to extract from you, a Ukrainian who was your neighbor and want to extract some -- some things and -- and he had the right, with no right for you at all.</span> <span id="s292">He can come into your house and say you did so and so and it was not -- it was not done so and so, but he’ll say it and he -- you have to gi -- bribe him for it.</span> <span id="s293">You have to give him some money and I remember a Ukrainian once walked into the house where I lived.</span> <span id="s294">We talked him out of it, but we were scared stiff.</span> <span id="s295">We knew we got nothing to do with it, he just came for some -- for something just to -- to get from us either sacks of money or something, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s296">From the -- because the grown up, they were very worried about it.</span> <span id="s297">But we talked him out and he left.</span> <span id="s298">And so it was -- was very tough -- was very tough and especially for young -- for young people, but we had our hopes, maybe, maybe.</span> <span id="s299">Because a few times -- but three times before to make the real acts -- aktion, the real killing.</span> <span id="s300">There were like a preparatory -- like for instance, all of a sudden there, they said all the Jews from the ghetto must come to an appeal and it was on Yaki -- on Yom Kippur day.</span> <span id="s301">And all the Jews came, they came to the marketplace or whatever, they ask us to come to a certain -- to a certain place and then they ask everybody to go back home.</span> <span id="s302">Do you understand?</span> <span id="s303">They wanted us to prepare, if the real thing will come, we should know the difference -- we shouldn’t know the difference, we should just come voluntarily, because they ask us to come.</span> <span id="s304">I think twice was an appeal like this and I remember my great uncle and it was Yom Kippur and he wore his shawl, he was praying to God and he said, “I’m not going.</span> <span id="s305">If they wanted, they come to get me,” but this is what -- just a false appeal.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: Describe, if you would, what happened -- there was a night that you went into hiding in the ghetto and you mentioned it in the first interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: Yes, we lived in that aseparation, til the day came, our ghetto was surrounded by Ukrainians and German police.</span> <span id="s308">A decree right -- there were plac -- placard -- placards, you know, placards?</span> <span id="s309">There’s a great word, yeah?</span> <span id="s310">Was posted on the unerat, on the consul, that the next day all the Jews must come to -- by the gate of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s311">And then penetrated most of us, that that night before, they brought a lot of Jews from some small towns and they brought them into Sarnee.</span> <span id="s312">Right away a panic struck all the people.</span> <span id="s313">And this morning, in the morning, my mother came up, she said, “I want you to go into hiding.”</span> <span id="s314">I resisted it and I said, “What will be with everybody, will be with me.”</span> <span id="s315">She said, “No, maybe let’s try, maybe one of us will survive.”</span> <span id="s316">And I remember running with a whole bunch of people -- people with -- women with kids in their arms.</span> <span id="s317">And live ammunition they were throwing in -- into -- s-some of them were killed instantly.</span> <span id="s318">And imagine the panic?</span> <span id="s319">Again my mother resisted and where did I went into hiding, I went to my uncle’s house, who was right by the fence, if you jump over the fence, you were already on the outside, on the free -- on the free world, or whatever, the free side.</span> <span id="s320">Outside of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s321">In a -- my uncle’s -- where my uncle lived, they had a barn and they had cows before the war, they used to sell milk or something.</span> <span id="s322">And in that barn, they built a double wall and again, a little opening on the side, they opened this opening and the people walked in and when I walked in they let me in, there were about 12 people already down there.</span> <span id="s323">And I always say, because it stands out in my mind horrible, this grandmother, this beautiful old lady was sitting down there, with her cherch if I remember, a fine woman.</span> <span id="s324">She was asking us questions, what are we sitting in here, why don’t you go out?</span> <span id="s325">She did -- was in a raid easily, who knows?</span> <span id="s326">And I said we didn’t know the -- the answers for ourselves and not for our grandmother.</span> <span id="s327">And the night started and we heard it’s -- the utifar getauchion, they wanted to burn the ghetto.</span> <span id="s328">They said, “If we must go, we’ll burn everything, you know, let’s go all in fire.”</span> <span id="s329">And I remember we were sitting behind the wall, we heard some people running right behind in the little alleys, right behind -- by n -- by us.</span> <span id="s330">Running back, running forth.</span> <span id="s331">Nothing materialize.</span> <span id="s332">They got, you know, the German find out about this sheme and more reinforcement came.</span> <span id="s333">From the fire department some reinforcement also, with the barrels of water and things.</span> <span id="s334">Nothing came of it.</span> <span id="s335">In this hold, she had -- that’s was the grandmother, her granddaughter, her son and her son’s wife was down there, plus other people in this hiding place.</span> <span id="s336">In the morning, he was -- it was a Mr. Loudier was his name.</span> <span id="s337">Mr. Loudier was a very respectable, res -- respected businessman.</span> <span id="s338">He was also in the lumber business, but in another town.</span> <span id="s339">And they were already were -- were -- were chased out from that town, Lunenietz, from that town and they came to our town, in the ghetto, in there where they stayed in this -- the grandmother, this -- this -- this son, and they -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning of Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: And in the morning, we wanted to find out what’s -- what’s goings on, so we send -- we ask this gentlemen -- this Mr. Loudier, the son of this grandmother of ours, we send him, we ask him, “Please go and find out.”</span> <span id="s341">He went in there to the -- whatever he -- they ask us to gather together.</span> <span id="s342">He come running back and he was white to his face and he said, “Everybody must come out from hiding.</span> <span id="s343">Anybody who will be caught hiding will be shot on the spot.”</span> <span id="s344">I heard this and I decided to meet up with my family, but the verdict was the same for the people who stayed behind, for the people who went, the verdict was the same.</span> <span id="s345">I decided to meet up with my parents and I came, I met my mother and we c -- we went to the assigned -- I remember my mother was ki -- was having a little something, some food, some blackberries, dried blackberries, whatever she had in the house.</span> <span id="s346">A little -- a little package, two little packages, that’s all.</span> <span id="s347">And I said, walking out from the house, I remember one lady across the -- across from our house, was closing her shutters -- and this will stick out in my mind forever.</span> <span id="s348">She closed up the shutters and sa -- and she said, “I hope my hands will open the shutters again.”</span> <span id="s349">She never saw them back -- she never came back.</span> <span id="s350">Because this was the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: She was in your same house in [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: She was across from our house.</span> <span id="s353">But I distinctly remember coming out from our house, I heard her saying so in a loud voice.</span> <span id="s354">And a lody were desperate, saying, “We are doomed.</span> <span id="s355">It’s late for us.”</span> <span id="s356">And you know, you -- you know even the most desperate times, you just don’t want it to believe, you don’t want it to believe, you think maybe -- maybe somehow, something will give.</span> <span id="s357">And we give into the assigned place and them bastards German, and I said the same thing before and if you want it.</span> <span id="s358">This German had a cart table, like a cart it was square table I remember.</span> <span id="s359">And he had a list of names.</span> <span id="s360">He was red to his face when we walked up too closely, he stunk from alcohol.</span> <span id="s361">And he was calling out names, alphabetically.</span> <span id="s362">Putting them in groups.</span> <span id="s363">And somebody who was not -- was not there at that moment, he used to mark them off.</span> <span id="s364">Like you would go someplace for outing or for something -- we didn’t know at the time what was going on.</span> <span id="s365">Then we find out.</span> <span id="s366">Putting us in groups, taken behind the gate and then right we were surrounded to Germans and Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s367">And they took away the people someplace in the outskirts of town.</span> <span id="s368">As my name is Schier, my maiden’s name, so you -- I was almost from the end -- to the end, leaving the ghetto.</span> <span id="s369">When our time came, I remember this little kid was sitting down there.</span> <span id="s370">His parents are already taken, he was sitting and crying.</span> <span id="s371">And instead of the German was ready to take the pistol and kill him, we grabbed this kid and we dragged him along.</span> <span id="s372">And we went outside toward the gate.</span> <span id="s373">I remember this German walking beside me, he stunk with alcohol too.</span> <span id="s374">And he had a armband, I remember, with a skeleton on it, a black armband.</span> <span id="s375">And something with a head of some kind of -- and one of the ladies who were older, she ask him, “Where are you taking us?”</span> <span id="s376">She said, “To a working camp.”</span> <span id="s377">He knew exactly where they are taking us.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: Do you remember the approximate date that this happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: It was 19 -- 1942.</span> <span id="s380">[indecipherable] August, 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: And you had been in the ghetto for a year by that point, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s383">It [inaudible] more than a year, 1944 in June.</span> <span id="s384">Duatse turovio e uda.</span> <span id="s385">In July started the war.</span> <span id="s386">The Germans occupied and right away we went into ghetto, so it was approximately more than a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s388">Let’s pause for a moment.</span> <span id="s389">You want to go back a little bit and just -- and just mention something about the contrast o-of your life from when you were in the ghetto to be-before, your life before the German occupation.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: Yeah, the life before the German occupation was fun for us kids.</span> <span id="s391">It was -- we were not -- we we-were worried -- just worried about our school.</span> <span id="s392">We used to get together and in school were the lody -- a lot I remember good times.</span> <span id="s393">We had all kind activities and we had the festivities of all kind and we had I remember even lottery.</span> <span id="s394">And this was a, you know, s-sticks in your mind.</span> <span id="s395">And w -- an-and this was -- and it was a lody -- a lody fun we had at b -- you know.</span> <span id="s396">And it was in contrast of course, in contrast whatever it happened later.</span> <span id="s397">It was -- it was like a disaster -- it was -- it was completely -- completely the opposite, completely different.</span> <span id="s398">And that’s -- what can I add more?</span> <span id="s399">That’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: You said you still had hope.</span> <span id="s401">Did you spend a lot of time remembering those good times that you had had?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: I -- in the ghetto, yeah.</span> <span id="s403">When I was in the ghetto?</span> <span id="s404">Yeah.</span> <span id="s405">We used to get together and we used to even -- there was this very s -- very, very -- girl, who went -- she was older than -- than I was and she used to s -- read me poetry, she used to discuss some books with me and I loved it, to listen to her, she was -- she was older and I looked up to her.</span> <span id="s406">And we used to have our hopes.</span> <span id="s407">And I remember she was a sick girl, you know, she had some kind of problems.</span> <span id="s408">You know, as a kid I did not -- I did not -- not -- I did not question, but I knew she was -- she had all kind of -- but she was very intelligent and very well read and so I used to meet her a lot during and in the ghetto actually, when they took us in and down to this enclosure, I went up to her and I said, “Run with me.”</span> <span id="s409">She said, “No, I’m not leaving my mother.”</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: What was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: You know, I don’t -- Shanedell?</span> <span id="s412">I would say Shanedell or -- I don’t remember [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s413">Shanedell, I think it was her name.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: It wasn’t Zelda?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: No, Zelda was a girl who lived with me in -- in the same house.</span> <span id="s416">Zelda was a distant relative of mine, she was like a cousin and Zelda had a cast on her leg -- mention to you now?</span> <span id="s417">A cast on her leg and she said, “Brenda, when something -- when horrible things will happen, we have to run.”</span> <span id="s418">I said, “You will be able to run, but not me.”</span> <span id="s419">And she was right.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: Was everyone who lived in the house with you in the ghetto, related to you in some way or were there people who weren’t related?</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: No, th-there were some related and some non.</span> <span id="s422">And in the other room, down there, there were four in a little tiny room -- there were four people who escaped already someplace, from Barcel, from Kraków, they escaped the Germans.</span> <span id="s423">And they were shaking in their boots, they knew more about the Germans than we did.</span> <span id="s424">And -- and I remember this -- this woman, with the man, they were so scared that they -- it’s, you know, they were shaking, absolute -- plain shaking.</span> <span id="s425">And they knew -- they knew this -- that’s the horrible things, that’s -- that’s the disaster is coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: Did your f-father and your family start to be convinced at that point that --</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: Yeah, my father didn’t talk too ready, too much and my mother because it’s --nothing was to say.</span> <span id="s428">They felt bad, you know, he had to have the kids, he had to have -- and they see that it’s -- who knows, maybe it’s not tomorrow -- it’s no-not a tomorrow, that’s -- that’s, you know they -- they didn’t know exactly, we heard some rumors, they are killing here, killing there, but hear everybody to be murdered, it’s -- it’s -- it’s something -- something we could not comprehend.</span> <span id="s429">And I remember when we were growing up already to the -- to the -- in our group, there was a Madame Klace, was a friend of ours, with her daughter and she said to me, “Look at me,” she said, “you know?</span> <span id="s430">You are so flink, you are so fast on the move,” she said.</span> <span id="s431">“You are young.</span> <span id="s432">You might escape -- you will escapes.”</span> <span id="s433">Not might, she said, “You will escape.”</span> <span id="s434">And she said, “When you will escape, remember, I have my belongings.</span> <span id="s435">My daughter -- one of my daughters,” she said, “went away with the Russians when they retreated.</span> <span id="s436">And if you ever see her, and if you’ll survive, tell her that my belongings is there and there and there.”</span> <span id="s437">I said, “Miss Klace, we are going in the same group, we are going in the same thing.”</span> <span id="s438">And that’s [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s439">I survived and I met her daughter.</span> <span id="s440">Her daughter came back from Russia.</span> <span id="s441">I told her her belongings, her mother told me where the belongings are.</span> <span id="s442">I went with her and they gave her back.</span> <span id="s443">She could have -- she tooked all those things that belonged to her parents, not all those things, whatever apar they gave her and she used to sell on the market and get some bread, some food for herself and for her little girl who she brought with her.</span> <span id="s444">She was married and then divorced, or her husband was killed, I don’t remember exactly the story.</span> <span id="s445">But I met her, it’s something like a prophecy and it sounded like fiction, if it wouldn’t happen to me at that time.</span> <span id="s446">And she said to me distinctly, “If you’ll survive, tell so and so.”</span> <span id="s447">And it was to me all so unreal at that time, but here it happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: And she wasn’t the only -- you had mentioned that someone else had said to you, “You’re fast, y-you can survive.”</span> <span id="s449">You must have been very -- y-you must have really had a -- a strong personality, or were you --</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: Maybe I did, I don’t know, I cannot tell you, but I must -- I did.</span> <span id="s451">I did.</span> <span id="s452">And a will to live.</span> <span id="s453">And when they ordered us in to this -- to this enclosure, their right penetrated, you know, in this -- this was my first encounter what a -- a camp looked like.</span> <span id="s454">You know, we -- in -- the funny part, our own people from our ghetto build that camp.</span> <span id="s455">It was double barbed wire from one side, one -- one barbed wire from the other side, because the Germans were sitting on a hill and this was like in a little valley, in a little valley.</span> <span id="s456">And on the -- on the far end was a Catholic church.</span> <span id="s457">A Catholic church and down there on the left, on the -- on the far left, was the school where I used to go to school.</span> <span id="s458">A beautiful school, in my -- you know, I don’t know with my eyes, the way I would see it now, but at that time it was m -- you know, a beautiful school.</span> <span id="s459">And it was right on the left.</span> <span id="s460">And when they -- and when they brought us in to this enclosure, you know ra -- it had the -- all the people from the small towns were already gathered in there, too.</span> <span id="s461">We -- I’m telling you, there -- to get a vitass, when they all brought a thing on there.</span> <span id="s462">We were between si -- 16,000 people, I can be shy a few hundred, I don’t know -- 16, 17, I ca -- I don’t know for sure.</span> <span id="s463">But they brought in from four or five little towns, they brought them in at night.</span> <span id="s464">And when we -- and when they -- when we walked in to this -- to this enclosure, we saw already dead people.</span> <span id="s465">They tried to escape during the night and th-the blood was dried by the barbed wire.</span> <span id="s466">They tried to escape at night and they killed them right there and then, they never -- they didn’t took away the bodies.</span> <span id="s467">And we had witness all those things.</span> <span id="s468">We walked in, we saw it already, that’s the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: Had you been allowed to bring any of your belongings into the camp from the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: At -- not belonging, they say to bring food -- food and some of your precious, you know, because they wanted to rob us from all those things.</span> <span id="s471">No, my mother -- we di -- were not rich people.</span> <span id="s472">My mother took a little bit food and that’s it.</span> <span id="s473">A little bit what she had and a little to feed three kids down there, I don’t know whatever she had, that’s all.</span> <span id="s474">And there is a electrician was in the camp.</span> <span id="s475">Was penetrated right through the camp that we are going to cut the barbed wire.</span> <span id="s476">I start running around and -- and down there, this German and also in the -- and I always try to emphasize this too.</span> <span id="s477">In this sea of hate, we were surrounded.</span> <span id="s478">Was down there, this German was a olderly, was my father’s age.</span> <span id="s479">They put him down there between the double barbed wire with a gun against us and he -- my friend, who I saw her for the first time, went up to him, he had the right to shoot her right then and then.</span> <span id="s480">I was staying behind him.</span> <span id="s481">And he looked at her, he looked at me and he said, with tears in his eyes, he said, “You dummy, you lowvensay from here.</span> <span id="s482">They -- when they toachlowt they will kill you all.”</span> <span id="s483">They said, “You dummy, you.</span> <span id="s484">Run from here, they will kill you all.”</span> <span id="s485">And tears was rolling and he looked at me behind and he said, “My God, I have a daughter your age.</span> <span id="s486">What they are doing to you?”</span> <span id="s487">But we knew our fate is sealed.</span> <span id="s488">Then the electrician smuggled in a barbed wire clipper and there were -- the other guy, Migdal, who was also ordered in, he was tall and blonde and always -- always s-say the same thing.</span> <span id="s489">Was tall and blonde.</span> <span id="s490">And he looked more Aryan German, like any the Germans that was standing against us.</span> <span id="s491">And his only crime was because he was of Jewish faith.</span> <span id="s492">Maybe he was from a mixed family, who knows?</span> <span id="s493">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s494">And I always will call him a hero.</span> <span id="s495">He was one of the two guys who went and he clipped the barbed wire.</span> <span id="s496">But before the clipping of barbed wire, I went up to my mother and -- and -- and I said, “Mother, I will run.”</span> <span id="s497">She looked at the hill, she looked at me and she said, “Where is the decency of the world?”</span> <span id="s498">It was none.</span> <span id="s499">And she pointed with her finger and she said, “If you’ll remain alive, you should never, never forget.”</span> <span id="s500">And that’s maybe was my promise, if I’ll run out in this hell of hells, I’ll fight.</span> <span id="s501">And if I have to fight and I have to die, I’ll die with a gun in my hand.</span> <span id="s502">And at least I’ll know that I was fighting against my enemy.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: How long after you arrived in the camp did this happen, that -- that the barbed wire was clipped and you escaped?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: Within hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: Within hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: Within hours.</span> <span id="s507">I remember people start running around.</span> <span id="s508">I started going around and I said it on the tape before, you know.</span> <span id="s509">I start seeing my relatives from the small towns, where they brought them in a night before.</span> <span id="s510">And here I came across this pious man, my great uncle was sitting on the ground with his whole family and they called alphabetically.</span> <span id="s511">They were prepared, they were organized, the Germans, the killing squads with their organize.</span> <span id="s512">And alphabetically they call up their -- their little town was Berishnits.</span> <span id="s513">They call up Berishnits must come to the gate.</span> <span id="s514">And my uncle was praying down there, sitting.</span> <span id="s515">And his daughter sa -- was standing down there and she had something on her hand.</span> <span id="s516">My mother and I went up to her and we ask her, “What is this on your -- on your hand?”</span> <span id="s517">She said, “This is my wedding gown, this is my fiancé.”</span> <span id="s518">And they got up and they left and that’s it, that’s the last I’ve seen of them.</span> <span id="s519">I went up to my zadee, to my grandfather, who is on the picture and I tell grand -- “Zadee, I’m going to run.”</span> <span id="s520">He put I remember his hand on my head and he said, “God should bless you and help you.”</span> <span id="s521">I don’t know, maybe he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: It must have been frightening to make that decision to escape when you had seen all the dead bodies lying around of people who had tried before and who had failed.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: It was a choice between dying or -- or -- o-or running, that’s all.</span> <span id="s524">I didn’t know that I’ll escape.</span> <span id="s525">I thought if they have to get me, they have to get me through -- in the back.</span> <span id="s526">So I’ll will be dead and if I’ll escape, I’ll do something.</span> <span id="s527">So it was my pure luck.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: How did you hear about the barbed wire was to -- the -- the barbed wire was to be cut?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: Well, you know, that’s like a -- it’s went through the camp, right away through -- through the camp, went through that we are going to try to cut the barbed wire.</span> <span id="s530">So there was this Ger -- this German was standing -- there’s the good German, right to the exnim left and then the Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s531">The Ukrainian had to be bribed.</span> <span id="s532">And I call him the lackase of the Germans.</span> <span id="s533">They did all the dirty work for them.</span> <span id="s534">They were four smarterer than them and they were my -- my countrymen.</span> <span id="s535">We had to give him some trinkets and we told him that we need some water, it was a hot day.</span> <span id="s536">And I remember the father of my friend who went to school with me, took off his boot -- a boot and he take to the -- to this Ukrainian and we’ll tell him, “We’ll bribe you, we’ll give you some -- some gold.”</span> <span id="s537">And I remember my mother took off also her ring and put it down there in this little -- in this little packet.</span> <span id="s538">And we told him, actually we didn’t want him, we didn’t care.</span> <span id="s539">We want him just the -- for time, we were -- we were -- we were fighting for time.</span> <span id="s540">So then we -- he went away in one -- in the other direction, the barbed wire was cut and then how -- that’s how I ran out from there.</span> <span id="s541">And people on top of people were laid -- I actually ran over people, all across, because their own people were standing in between, you understand?</span> <span id="s542">From the hill they could not cut us down with the -- with machine guns, because their own people they would murder.</span> <span id="s543">So, til they cordoned off from around with the -- with the -- with the police and with the -- in b -- their own people, we had time to escape and that’s how I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: How many people --</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: My mother -- my mother saw me running, she threw my sister over and she said, “There is Brenda.”</span> <span id="s546">And that’s how my sister survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: How many people escaped, apart from you and your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: I [indecipherable] count how many [indecipherable] maybe in the hun -- a few hundred, but then they were caught.</span> <span id="s549">I knew the surroundings, I knew the villages around, so I knew where to run away from the city.</span> <span id="s550">But the people who didn’t, escaped, but they didn’t had where to escape and they were caught.</span> <span id="s551">And I remember while being there in the camp, there was my dentist, who was once a refugee already, she was from --</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: I want you to take me, if you can, inside of that moment when you were saying good-bye to your mother, right before you escaped and describe what your feelings were.</span> <span id="s553">Did you know that -- that you wouldn’t see her again?</span> <span id="s554">Did you have any premonitions of what was to come?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: I saw disaster.</span> <span id="s556">But I did not until -- I didn’t know -- I didn’t think.</span> <span id="s557">I did -- I was so preoccupied with everything that’s happening around me, I thought horrible.</span> <span id="s558">I didn’t -- I didn’t think straight.</span> <span id="s559">So my feeling were -- were -- were mixed and all mixed up anyway.</span> <span id="s560">And I thought that’s the end of humanity.</span> <span id="s561">And I remember this doctor, who was a dentist of mine, who I used to go with my pitten there to her during -- before the war.</span> <span id="s562">She was already one a refugee, escape from Warsaw, someplace in Mugrafa, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s563">And her husband was a doctor.</span> <span id="s564">And they have a little boy and while we there in this enclosure, they -- they throw her in like a piece of rag, like a piece of garbage they throw her in -- into our midst down there, in through the gate.</span> <span id="s565">And she was sitting on the ground I remember and had a little -- a little -- a little doctor’s kit -- a little doctor’s kit in her hand.</span> <span id="s566">She was sitting and telling, in desperation I remember, sitting in this position and talking like she would talk ab -- people surrounded her.</span> <span id="s567">She said, “My husband was killed in front of me.</span> <span id="s568">My kid was thrown from my hand and throwing against a telephone pole.”</span> <span id="s569">And she sod -- she said, “I saw his head was smashed.”</span> <span id="s570">And she was sitting in that position and telling us.</span> <span id="s571">She said, “There is not -- that’s the end of us.”</span> <span id="s572">She said, “I have 12 or 13 needles.</span> <span id="s573">Now anybody wants to die right away, one I leave for myself and the rest --” And people stood in line.</span> <span id="s574">And this is something not to be forgotten.</span> <span id="s575">And -- and there is another incident in the ghetto, there was Dr. Coen, because he was in Sarnee.</span> <span id="s576">Very fine doctor and a nice family, they had one daughter.</span> <span id="s577">And he lived for years and years, as long as I remember -- not like the other one, the other dentist who came, the -- the war, they were down there, local people who lived down there for years and years, is.</span> <span id="s578">And when he saw what’s happening, the night when we had to come to this place, the gathering place, he decided to take with his family, his own life.</span> <span id="s579">And he had a little food, whatever he prepared, he made a little party, like for themselves and they inject-injected some needles and they die.</span> <span id="s580">What -- what --when those Germans and the things ran into the house, they find them all dead.</span> <span id="s581">And we were told about it because in the morning right away, we knew what they did.</span> <span id="s582">Some of our friends, they said they tried to escape, their name was Korobotchka.</span> <span id="s583">You know it’s funny, sometimes I remember the names, gots -- gets into my head and sometimes I just Korobotchka and there was this -- they were also such a fine people.</span> <span id="s584">There was a husband and wife, there were already growing children.</span> <span id="s585">She was wearing a fur coat and trying to escape from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s586">And on the -- on the fence, they caught her in the sh -- they killed her right on the fence, him and her.</span> <span id="s587">And they were hanging half here and half there.</span> <span id="s588">And we knew right away what’s happening.</span> <span id="s589">My friend’s father -- we had our toilet outside -- my friend’s father had to go into the bathroom at night.</span> <span id="s590">And he went in and one of the police noticed him is moving -- a moving object and he gave him straight to his stomach, a bullet.</span> <span id="s591">And they brought him on a stretcher into the gh -- into down there -- to the camp.</span> <span id="s592">And he said, “I didn’t do nothing,” like he would defend himself.</span> <span id="s593">“I just went to the toilet.”</span> <span id="s594">They asks a few people to take him -- take him across and they killed him right there and then.</span> <span id="s595">People who were in the hospital and it’s sa -- in the hospital, they all brought them on horse and buggy down there and to come across the hill and they took him down there.</span> <span id="s596">They said they had a undressing place.</span> <span id="s597">After I came -- after the war, after it’s -- everything was done -- after I came, I find out all about they made a -- like a tree from -- from a -- like a -- a tree -- like a -- a round -- a tree -- a round thing with one entrance.</span> <span id="s598">And in the inside they ask all the people to undress.</span> <span id="s599">Some people didn’t wanted to undress.</span> <span id="s600">Undressed -- I imagine they wanted still to save the -- the -- the clothes from the people to save for themself.</span> <span id="s601">To save or to give away or to whatever they wanted to do.</span> <span id="s602">So some people decided no, kill us with our clothes.</span> <span id="s603">But this was a undressing place.</span> <span id="s604">Was made out of brick, actually.</span> <span id="s605">Like a -- like a -- a -- a round -- a tute -- a round thing and one entrance.</span> <span id="s606">And from there they took him by groups and they killed him and they [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s607">Because one of our friend, actually was down there, naked.</span> <span id="s608">Th-the bullet -- the bullet didn’t got him in between the dead.</span> <span id="s609">He ran out, after mart, in the evening or -- or something, in the evening.</span> <span id="s610">And he ran out in the -- into our -- into our peasant house and they gave him some clothes.</span> <span id="s611">And he was -- he was actually a hero in the woods.</span> <span id="s612">He escaped and he was a friend of my -- of my family.</span> <span id="s613">Actually, he helped me.</span> <span id="s614">Shimone Picov was his name.</span> <span id="s615">And so -- and so that’s the last moment when I left my family.</span> <span id="s616">I remember my -- my aunt was sitting with her daughter.</span> <span id="s617">You know, when I saw the Sards family, I swear to you, I saw -- I saw them.</span> <span id="s618">Because my aunt was sitting down there on the ground with her kid, my cousin was standing next to her with some more people and they were standing, I don’t think my -- my -- my aunt could understand what I was talking to her.</span> <span id="s619">I just observed, I looked at them and I went my way.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: Was your father there?</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: I -- we lost my father.</span> <span id="s622">Maybe he went because he spoke German, maybe he went, maybe he start a fight with some of the guards, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s623">We lost him an-and he -- we don’t know, maybe he killed him right then and there.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: On the way into the camp or when did that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: You know, I don’t -- my father -- we lost my father.</span> <span id="s626">Maybe he stayed behind, he le -- he stayed behind, or he went with us.</span> <span id="s627">I think -- I know he -- he went and then he disa -- we don’t know -- I don’t know, he disappeared.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: Maybe he never made it to the -- to the camp in the first place?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: Maybe he never made it to the camp in the first place, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s630">Or maybe he go -- started a argument with some of a German.</span> <span id="s631">Or he ask him some questions and they would kill and they killed him right there and then.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: The -- the morning that you came out of hiding, was he there?</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: My father, I remember my father was there.</span> <span id="s634">But then -- then I was -- I was surrounded with my mother, my brother, my sisters and I didn’t remember, maybe my father was -- was down there someplace.</span> <span id="s635">You know, because each one -- it was such a confusion, such a horrible thing, it was a mess.</span> <span id="s636">It wa -- it was not -- not something -- something -- we saw it, it -- it’s something tragic, something horrible.</span> <span id="s637">And I will never forget this son of a gun went with me, this -- S-Sahartski was his name.</span> <span id="s638">We went in the same school than I -- than I did.</span> <span id="s639">And he had a lot of friends -- of Jewish friends and -- and he was older -- older than us.</span> <span id="s640">But always he tried to -- to be friendly and this and that.</span> <span id="s641">When the Germans came, he joined this evil cause and he became a policeman and he was standing with a gun.</span> <span id="s642">I came up to him and I wanted to go to the bathroom.</span> <span id="s643">And he said, “Get away or I’ll kill you right there and then, I’ll kill you.”</span> <span id="s644">And this rage I said, “Oh God.</span> <span id="s645">If I will get him.”</span> <span id="s646">So that’s were the moment.</span> <span id="s647">And my feelings were mixed.</span> <span id="s648">You ask me, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s649">I felt horrible.</span> <span id="s650">I felt disillusioned, enchanted, enchant?</span> <span id="s651">Disen -- dis --</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: Disenchanted?</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: Disenchanted.</span> <span id="s654">That the whole thing was surrounding us.</span> <span id="s655">People we live for centuries all of a sudden became criminals.</span> <span id="s656">I’m at 16, was in there.</span> <span id="s657">I was a criminal, for what reason, what was my crime?</span> <span id="s658">We were decent, nice people, we are beasically to our life’s daily life, preoccupied to make a living, to -- to do the right thing and all of a sudden, because of a -- of a distraught man, and he had the power, but the people who helped him and the rest of the world did not makes any -- didn’t say a thing.</span> <span id="s659">That was the horrible, horrible thing.</span> <span id="s660">England was quiet.</span> <span id="s661">And they paid a price afterwards.</span> <span id="s662">Which one -- we had to -- we had to get in it to war, because between two evils, they were -- they were the biggest.</span> <span id="s663">We had to be anyway in the war -- get into the war.</span> <span id="s664">And if they would knock down Hitler before he acquired so much power, this catastrophe would never taken place.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: That moment that you -- that you were escaping and you were running away, you -- you mentioned in the first interview that you -- that you got separated from your sister and then you found her again a little bit later.</span> <span id="s666">You had -- you wanted --</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: I ran out -- I ran out each for only sil -- I remember with a -- with a group of t -- of two boys and girls.</span> <span id="s668">I ran out, I stepped over people and some -- some the blood went out -- was on me.</span> <span id="s669">And I ran to -- my first instinct, to go in this church, in this Catholic church.</span> <span id="s670">But I ran up and I said, “We are -- they can see us.</span> <span id="s671">Where can we hide down there?”</span> <span id="s672">And I proceeded to run.</span> <span id="s673">I proceeded to run, my mother saw me, she pushed my sister, she threw her over the barbed wire, she said, “There’s Brenda.”</span> <span id="s674">And she was running behind me and she was all bloody.</span> <span id="s675">Her little shirt -- it was a hot day there and you know my instinct, I was so -- I was so, you know, mixed up.</span> <span id="s676">My instinct first -- we said, “They will recognize.”</span> <span id="s677">She was all bloody, I said, “She’ll recognize she’s Jewish because her blood is on the shirt.”</span> <span id="s678">And I took off the shirt and I throw away in a -- in a yard and I ran.</span> <span id="s679">And I ran to our friendly family, where they are, our good friends, they are Polish people and we did a lot of good things for them.</span> <span id="s680">Actually my mother was instrumental for them not to go to Siberia.</span> <span id="s681">And they said -- they used to call my mother their daughter.</span> <span id="s682">So the fir -- instinct, the first thing I would run to them, they were not far from down there.</span> <span id="s683">I run up to the house and the lady, I ask her, “Please give us some water.”</span> <span id="s684">Simma was behind me, my sister Simma.</span> <span id="s685">She gave us some water -- said, “Hide us.”</span> <span id="s686">She said, “I’m afraid.”</span> <span id="s687">I couldn’t understand.</span> <span id="s688">And down there was -- I think I said it in the interview too, if you want, I’ll repeat it.</span> <span id="s689">But that -- that fenced-in little yard and I opened th-the -- the door and I walked in and then her husband, with a whole bunch of his friends, some Poles, some Ukrainians, standing in a half circle and telling jokes.</span> <span id="s690">And it struck me horrible.</span> <span id="s691">They saw -- do you understand they could hear the -- the shots?</span> <span id="s692">I don’t know that was -- they knew right or mairment or they didn’t know, but when they saw us, this -- this husband of this -- this and of lat -- some of the people I knew too.</span> <span id="s693">They scow when I dis -- th-they stac -- they stopped in their tracks and they looked at us because we looked like -- like wild animals.</span> <span id="s694">Like -- like something escape, wounded animals.</span> <span id="s695">I was barefooted, my sister were -- was barefooted, half naked.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: Were they -- they weren’t telling jokes about j --</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: I don’t know what the jokes were all about.</span> <span id="s698">When they saw us they stopped the jokes at once.</span> <span id="s699">I looked at them, they looked at us and I we -- I went out from down there.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q: How did you -- so they turned you away?</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A: They turned -- I could understand they were afraid because they could as -- they could have killed them and us together.</span> <span id="s702">So my sister was right behind me.</span> <span id="s703">I ran in the direction what I knew where they used to go to my grandparents and we lived also, not far from town, where we had a grocery, my father worked as a -- as a selector of woods.</span> <span id="s704">And so I knew and my sister was behind me, you know, wussup, and I lost my sister.</span> <span id="s705">I lost her.</span> <span id="s706">I didn’t had the time, I was birf, I was all alone.</span> <span id="s707">I didn’t had the time to look for her, I lost her and I said, “She will come somehow.”</span> <span id="s708">And I went all by myself.</span> <span id="s709">I was afraid to go through the bridge, down there was a bridge.</span> <span id="s710">We had a little -- a river sloot.</span> <span id="s711">I was afraid to go over the bridge because maybe some patrol or maybe some policeman with guns, they are standing and they will kill me right there and then.</span> <span id="s712">So I went through the water and down there a shepherd boys was standing, so I ask him, because we had some -- some -- some -- some -- what -- the water, you know, the water -- what do we call it, you know, the -- like -- they -- they had some things in the -- in the water that can grab you in.</span> <span id="s713">Kettle?</span> <span id="s714">Water kettle?</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: Oh, like a --</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: Like a whirlpool.</span> <span id="s717">Like a whirlpool?</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A: Like a whirlpool.</span> <span id="s720">And you have to know because down there it’s -- there were places where there is those whirlpools and they suck you in.</span> <span id="s721">So I ask the -- End of Tape One, Side B Beginning of Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Brenda Senders.</span> <span id="s723">This is tape number two, side A.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: Well, how do you spell it?</span> <span id="s725">Okay, so I went -- I was afraid to go on the bridge, I went through -- the shepherds guys told me where to go through because down there are these whirlpools, so I went by and I went on the other side, I was all alone.</span> <span id="s726">And I went and I was waiting up til dark.</span> <span id="s727">Dark, I proceeded my journey and I remember some Ukrainians were coming from -- from the city and I heard them talking about what they are doing, they are killing all -- all of the Jewish people and they were a little bit with sorrow in there, I could hear by their voices.</span> <span id="s728">But they were the -- but they were about their own business.</span> <span id="s729">I went into the village where my grandparents lived and I knew the -- her neighbor was a very good friend of them, so I went in and I knew I had to go in through the back yard, nobody should see me.</span> <span id="s730">I tapped on the -- on the -- on the window and he opened the door.</span> <span id="s731">On the door actually I tapped, he opened the door, I went in and who did I find?</span> <span id="s732">My sister and my uncle.</span> <span id="s733">It was like fiction.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: Had your uncle escaped from the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: My uncle escaped the same time I did.</span> <span id="s736">And he ran also to the same, because we knew this -- this man was a very decent and nice Christian man.</span> <span id="s737">Nice, fine man and a good friend of ours.</span> <span id="s738">My sister, when I lost her, she met up with my cousin and another distant cousin what I lived in the ghetto, with a group of men who escaped and were going in the same direction.</span> <span id="s739">And she came right across the dam and they took her along.</span> <span id="s740">And when they brought her to the village, they said, “This man is a nice man, go into him -- go into his house.”</span> <span id="s741">And that’s how we met, all three of us.</span> <span id="s742">And the rest of the people, they went -- they went -- my grandfather had a -- a mill, a windmill, what you use to make flours, in the outskirts of the village.</span> <span id="s743">So my cousin -- you know, I don’t know how many there were, but four or five men, they went to this windmill and they were hiding down there for days and then they went into the woods.</span> <span id="s744">Mostly of the people survived from this little group what escaped.</span> <span id="s745">My sister survived, I survived and my uncle survived.</span> <span id="s746">And from that point --</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: Tell me the name of your uncle who survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: Uncle Usher.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: And what were the name of the -- the family who -- who helped you and who -- who you -- the friends of your grandparents?</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: I’ll tell you, Austop [inaudible] -- Austop was his name, Austop.</span> <span id="s751">His last name I don’t know.</span> <span id="s752">But Austop was his name, a fine man.</span> <span id="s753">He had a grandmother also, who was like a angel.</span> <span id="s754">She was a real good human being.</span> <span id="s755">I lived in that village for a little while.</span> <span id="s756">And there was some good people down there, too.</span> <span id="s757">But there was some nasty ones too, you know.</span> <span id="s758">Went along the easy way and they thought they’ll have a paradise, they didn’t.</span> <span id="s759">The promises Hitler will gave them, were never delivered to them.</span> <span id="s760">He just exploitated them to do the dirty job and then he went about his business.</span> <span id="s761">He made them his policemen, he promised them the Ukraine to give them, he never delivered them.</span> <span id="s762">He never gave it, he never -- when he felt it that they are -- were a little bit stronger, he took away the ammunition from them.</span> <span id="s763">And then a lot of them went -- went also into the underground.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: How long did you stay in that village?</span></p> <p><span id="s765">A: In that village, a short while.</span> <span id="s766">I was working a few months, I would say.</span> <span id="s767">Maybe not even that long.</span> <span id="s768">And I decided to go deep into the woods.</span> <span id="s769">I heard that Shimone Picov was -- who escaped from the graves like I told you.</span> <span id="s770">From the graves, actually, he was wounded very slightly.</span> <span id="s771">In it -- in the evening he got out from under the dead people and he escape and people -- peasant people gave him some clothes.</span> <span id="s772">And I decided to go into the dup-deep woods [indecipherable] Russia.</span> <span id="s773">They have a lot of swamps and deep woods.</span> <span id="s774">And we had a inkling already that’s partisans.</span> <span id="s775">They’re and here, we didn’t know where and what, but we knew that they are organizing and they are -- they are -- they are grouping themselves in groups.</span> <span id="s776">So I decided I’ll go down there or I’ll meet up with some other people like myself.</span> <span id="s777">And -- but in this village I worked for a woman who used to make sweaters, I remember.</span> <span id="s778">She was so nice to me.</span> <span id="s779">And she could not understand the politics and all this nonsense.</span> <span id="s780">And she said, “Why they wanted to kill you?”</span> <span id="s781">I said, “I don’t know mys -- I don’t know.”</span> <span id="s782">She said, “Why -- if they will come to kill you, they will have to kill me too.”</span> <span id="s783">I said, “No, I don’t want you to be killed on account of me.”</span> <span id="s784">But she was a good soul.</span> <span id="s785">Sh -- I used to make sweaters, knit for them sweaters and work and be in hiding.</span> <span id="s786">And I looked like a peasant girl.</span> <span id="s787">I spoke the language well, so -- an-and she was -- and she used to tell them that I’m from another village, whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Q: Was your sister there throughout those months that you were there too?</span></p> <p><span id="s789">A: My sister was there, yes.</span> <span id="s790">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q: And your uncle?</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: And my uncle I separated myself from him because he said it’s too dangerous, a man -- for women was easier and I -- I decided to separate from him, not to endanger him and a prea group.</span> <span id="s793">And then we decided one night to go to -- into the deep woods and to meet up with this Shimone -- Shimone Picov and whatever group he is.</span> <span id="s794">And it’s easier now to tell than it happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: Tell me first, did -- who was that escaped to join up with -- with Shimone.</span> <span id="s796">Was it -- was your sister with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: My sister was with me, yes, but we heard that Shimone escaped and he was from a village, he knew the village people and he was something -- some -- some -- I wanted to meet him because he knew our family.</span> <span id="s798">Why, I cannot explain, but I knew our family -- I knew he knew the village people and I thought maybe he’ll be some kind of protector and I was right in some ways.</span> <span id="s799">So one evening we decided we are going at night, dark at night we decided we are going to that village.</span> <span id="s800">And this was like 10 kilometers from that destination.</span> <span id="s801">And I start going by a little creek, a little creek I went.</span> <span id="s802">At night it was dark, dark at night and at night you don’t d -- I hear the barking of the -- of the -- of the -- the dogs all around me and they are -- they’re on -- then there, you know, like farmhouses.</span> <span id="s803">A farmhouse surrounded with the -- with the field -- what they -- what they harvest, potatoes and all those things.</span> <span id="s804">And each farmhouse had around, you know -- doe each separated from the other, like in here, too, separate farms.</span> <span id="s805">And I heard the dogs sunna -- in -- in -- at night.</span> <span id="s806">I -- we went around in circle, twice.</span> <span id="s807">And I saw it, now we have to take the creek.</span> <span id="s808">The creek will take us out someplace.</span> <span id="s809">And my sister and myself started walking by the creek and I heard, at night, in the dark night, I heard some people washing their hands on the other side.</span> <span id="s810">Washing their hands and I almost woke -- start blabling out, “Who are you?”</span> <span id="s811">And then I said, “Let me be quiet -- let me -- let me think.</span> <span id="s812">Let me hear more words, what they are saying.”</span> <span id="s813">They were thieves, coming from the other village, who were tilling out honey from the hives, tilling out honey and some other stuff they were -- they were, you know, they were stealing from the village people, but actually, my family lived down there -- and they were coming back home.</span> <span id="s814">I don’t know -- and one said to the other one, after washing their hands, “Let’s get up and let’s go because it’s daybreak, is going to be and somebody will see us.”</span> <span id="s815">I don’t know if I would talk to them, maybe they would let us go because we were almost on the same level like with them, they were -- we were criminal.</span> <span id="s816">You understand, they knew that we wouldn’t talk against them.</span> <span id="s817">I don’t know, but that’s the chance I didn’t wanted to take.</span> <span id="s818">They washed their hands, they took this -- the -- the -- the -- grabbed their things and they went back where they -- where their homes were, before daybreak.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">Q: So you and your sister are on your way to the deep woods to find this group of partisans.</span> <span id="s820">How did you know where to go?</span> <span id="s821">Did you have any idea?</span></p> <p><span id="s822">A: I knew Karasin, I knew that I’m going the direction of Karasin.</span> <span id="s823">And when I’ll go out and the creek took me out.</span> <span id="s824">You know, you learn fast.</span> <span id="s825">He says, “How did you learn to fight?”</span> <span id="s826">You learn fast.</span> <span id="s827">You -- the creek took us out to this -- to this highway, a little highway, it’s not a highway like we -- anything here -- to this highway and we knew this will take me to Karasin.</span> <span id="s828">During the day we -- I remember we went in -- into the woods, we hide ourselves for some pe -- people who are coming or going somep -- they shouldn’t spotted us.</span> <span id="s829">And at night we proceeded.</span> <span id="s830">It took us two days til we arrived in Karasin.</span> <span id="s831">And I remember the first house we walked in, the woman cried when she saw us.</span> <span id="s832">She said, “Oh my God.”</span> <span id="s833">My feet were bloody, you know from -- from the scratching in the field with -- I was running around and it was already August, late August.</span> <span id="s834">And -- and she was crying actually, the woman.</span> <span id="s835">She gave us some -- some shoes from leek, like in the Roman times.</span> <span id="s836">What we make the shoes from leek, she gave us some shoes from leek to me and my sister and she showed me how to wear them.</span> <span id="s837">You put -- you put string in them and you wear them like -- in the Roman time, like the sandals, but this is -- the Romans was fancier, but this was very primitive.</span> <span id="s838">But you wear them in the winter, with some rags and then you put us -- those shoes and she taught us how to -- this is my first experience too, at that time.</span> <span id="s839">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s840">Q: So you didn’t -- that time that you were in the village, you didn’t get any shoes during that time, or did you lose them?</span></p> <p><span id="s841">A: I lost them on the way, yeah.</span> <span id="s842">So this is the leek, what she told me, it was torn up, you know, the man actually, from the village gave me, from Cartpelufka, the good man what let us in, he gave me also, but then I didn’t know how to do it and this, the woman who actually taught me, this is the way you do it, this the way you do it.</span> <span id="s843">And that -- she taught me how to -- to wear them properly.</span> <span id="s844">So, and I used to wear them during, you know -- til I went in -- into the -- into the partisans.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: How long were you on your journey?</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: Yeah, on the journey, I -- took me a few days.</span> <span id="s847">And I remember going into that village and asked right away Shimone, ou said, “Oy, Shimone is in the woods someplace.”</span> <span id="s848">And I said, “Where in the woods, the woods are big, where in the woods?”</span> <span id="s849">“Someplace.”</span> <span id="s850">So I slapped over to this woman, who actually taught me how to wear the leek shoes and she said, “Go across this swamp and down there into -- in the woods, you’ll find him someplace.”</span> <span id="s851">And in the swamp, you have to know what you’re doing, if not you can sink down there in a -- in a quicks -- in -- in a quicksand?</span> <span id="s852">In quick -- quicks -- you know, it’s not sand, but that’s the -- the swamp actually grabs you in.</span> <span id="s853">You have to know what you are doing, you have to go just by the path, not to stroll right, not to stroll left.</span> <span id="s854">And she told us, the woman told us.</span> <span id="s855">We went -- it took us about three kilometers, we went into the woods and when we came right in the outskirts of the woods, with all like teepee.</span> <span id="s856">Teepeetel, like the Indians.</span> <span id="s857">From straw, but in our -- in our country was made from straw.</span> <span id="s858">And we saw right away and then there were barns.</span> <span id="s859">We saw them -- there’s shepherd guys, must be shepherd guys.</span> <span id="s860">Because there were bottles, there were the teepeetel, the teepee from -- from straw.</span> <span id="s861">And I walked in with my sister and I said, “Let’s see,” it was daytime.</span> <span id="s862">I saw and I -- and I felt the ashes and they were warm.</span> <span id="s863">“Way,” I say, “there are people here.”</span> <span id="s864">I gots -- you know it was -- made me feel good.</span> <span id="s865">You know, it was -- it was -- it was in the woods.</span> <span id="s866">And I said, “Oh, it’s some people in here.”</span> <span id="s867">So I, “Let’s wait.”</span> <span id="s868">But let’s wait, we were hungry and we had nothing to drink, nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s869">I said, “Let’s go to a village man and maybe he’ll give us some food.”</span> <span id="s870">And we strolled away a little bit farther and there was a guy who had his farm right in -- deep in the woods.</span> <span id="s871">And he was putting up a stack of hay, him and his two sons, with -- with -- with some, you know, with some tools.</span> <span id="s872">We went up and I said to my sister, “You stay.”</span> <span id="s873">You know, we were af-afraid of the -- of the light, we were.</span> <span id="s874">You know, I said, “You stay here in case something happen, I want you to know.</span> <span id="s875">I’ll go in, I’ll talk to them.”</span> <span id="s876">I came up not -- not too close, I came within a distance, also I should be able to ran if they will have some bad intention against me.</span> <span id="s877">And I start asking him if there is Shimone Picov.</span> <span id="s878">He said, “Oh yeah, he’s someplace in the woods, with a lody more Jews,” he said.</span> <span id="s879">I said, “We are hungry and I would like you to give us some food.”</span> <span id="s880">And he start giving me a lecturing, why don’t I go back to the city, why don’t I give myself up to the Germans?</span> <span id="s881">I got so -- I got so upset.</span> <span id="s882">You know as -- as young as I was, I understood and I looked at this specimen of a human being and I said, “I didn’t came here for advice, I’m hungry and I want some food, if you can help us with that.”</span> <span id="s883">I said, “If you bore to church, if you do something,” I said, “you don’t know about your tomorrow.”</span> <span id="s884">And I said it to him.</span> <span id="s885">And he -- “I’ll -- I’ll send you some food,” but we didn’t trust him.</span> <span id="s886">I said, “Who knows, maybe he’ll come out with a gun, he’ll try to sh -- to kill us both.”</span> <span id="s887">We stayed in -- within a distance and there a guy came out, a guy who was a forester -- was watching over the forest.</span> <span id="s888">And he was friendly to us, he brought us the food, he gave us and we ate and at night we came back to this teepeetel.</span> <span id="s889">Why’d we came back -- so I still had very, very, very carefully -- before I went in I said, “Simma,” to my sister, “let me listen who are the ke -- who are the guys and who are the --” I looked in through the -- through down there a little hole -- peephole -- and I see there are two shepherd guys laying and down there a guy with a sweater with a little boy laying next to him.</span> <span id="s890">And I said, “This must be a Jewish man.</span> <span id="s891">Also escaped like we did.</span> <span id="s892">But if,” I said, “if he’s Jewish he’ll say something, avort from his sleep or something.”</span> <span id="s893">We were listening -- we’re standing there for hours and then actually it happened.</span> <span id="s894">He said something to the little boy and I right away I ran in and I got him by surprise and I said to him -- and I knew the family -- I knew the family, they also were used to -- friends of my parents.</span> <span id="s895">I said, “Where is Shimone Picov?”</span> <span id="s896">And I told him who I was.</span> <span id="s897">He said, “Oh, Shimone Picov, he doesn’t want kids, he doesn’t want nobody else, we are a big group and it’s very dangerous.”</span> <span id="s898">I said, “No, I’m going.</span> <span id="s899">You take us to Shimone Picov, and Shimone Picov will say we should not come, we should be away, we’ll go.”</span> <span id="s900">But in meantime I wanted to go and see Shimone Picov.</span> <span id="s901">He wanted to get out of the w -- you know, the dealvy task, but I insisted and I went alone -- and I went and I said, “I’ll go and I’ll find him anyway.”</span> <span id="s902">So he said, “Okay.”</span> <span id="s903">He took me with my sister, we came to this camp, there were about 30 -- 30 Jews o-or something, 30 or maybe 35, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s904">Also escaped the same -- the same day of the same -- from different part of the -- of the -- of the -- of the country.</span> <span id="s905">And they wind up down there in -- in this -- in the woods.</span> <span id="s906">Where is Shimone?</span> <span id="s907">Shimone is going out, he’s like scouting out.</span> <span id="s908">And he’s trying to get a -- a gun.</span> <span id="s909">At night Shimone came, he had already a gun and I came up to him with my sister and I said, “I’m the daughter of so and so.”</span> <span id="s910">Tears are rolling from my -- from his eyes and he said, “They are like my children and they are going to stay here.”</span> <span id="s911">And he was -- when he said it was -- it was the law.</span> <span id="s912">He was the leader of the group.</span> <span id="s913">He used to take us and then he used to watch over us.</span> <span id="s914">Let’s say he would stay two days in this destination, he would take us to another -- to another destination.</span> <span id="s915">We should not sit in the same place, we should not be surrounded by some enemy and be s -- and be massacred.</span> <span id="s916">And while I was down there, I used to go to the village and work for the people in the fields and get some potatoes and bring some potatoes in the -- in the -- in the -- in the woods.</span> <span id="s917">And I was no obstacle, the opposite, I was a help.</span> <span id="s918">So I went to the village, I used to work and at night I used to bring him potatoes and he will feed -- give to some food to some other people.</span> <span id="s919">And one day -- and this is -- I -- amashamont -- one day arrived down there a teacher, supposedly.</span> <span id="s920">From the city of Sarnee, where I came from.</span> <span id="s921">The teacher came and he announced down there to the -- to the -- to the head of the village, that he -- he was sent by the government to organize a school.</span> <span id="s922">Do you imagine the killing was going on, the war was -- was -- was going on and all of a sudden the Germans are preoccupied to open a school in this particular village?</span> <span id="s923">The news penetrated to us, we find out very fast and we knew that something is fishy about it.</span> <span id="s924">We have to watch this stranger, what his intentions and what he’s going to do.</span> <span id="s925">Within a few days he was asking all kind of questions and everyb -- and everything was -- was brought to our -- to our attention, because the -- the guy who -- the man -- the village man where he s-stayed with them, he was a friend of ours.</span> <span id="s926">And he went back to the -- to Sarnee, it was like 15 kilometers from that place on.</span> <span id="s927">And came back -- at that time it was unheard, because the Germans would have killed him, because they would think that he is a -- a spy for the -- for the -- for the partisans and all of a sudden he’s going free there and back.</span> <span id="s928">And we knew right away that the Germans are send -- send him in to -- to find out if there are some Jews there or some partisans and what the movement and what’s going on down there.</span> <span id="s929">And we knew we have to get rid of this -- this -- the German.</span> <span id="s930">Picov was instrumental.</span> <span id="s931">At night he walked in with another guy and they got rid of him.</span> <span id="s932">And he couldn’t go no more there and back.</span> <span id="s933">Then --</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Q: I have a -- a few questions before you go forward.</span> <span id="s935">Do you -- was your sister still with you at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s936">A: My sister was with me at this time, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s938">And this group that you met up with, that you said Shimone was the leader?</span></p> <p><span id="s939">A: Yes, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">Q: And there were about 35 or so --</span></p> <p><span id="s941">A: 35, maybe 40, I -- I don’t even count how many -- but I remember a group.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s943">And all -- all the members of the group at this point were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s944">A: Yeah, definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: So this is a jus --, yeah -- yeah.</span> <span id="s946">So this is -- this is before you had joined up with --</span></p> <p><span id="s947">A: With the big partisans</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: N-Now I -- now I -- nowmosco?</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: [indecipherable] nothing to do with -- this is [indecipherable] thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: Okay, okay, okay, I see.</span> <span id="s951">That wasn’t clear to me from the first interview, so now that’s clearer.</span> <span id="s952">And sec -- then -- then, okay I have a question about your response to the -- the German spy that -- who supposedly was a teacher who came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s953">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Q: Obviously this -- this is -- this was a -- a very extreme situation and -- and nobody -- you ca -- you -- you have to question everything before you trust anyone.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Q: Was it difficult for you to -- to accept that?</span> <span id="s957">Did -- were -- was there any hesitation or fear that maybe you were wrong, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s958">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">Q: It was -- did you feel --</span></p> <p><span id="s960">A: No w -- no way.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">Q: That conviction?</span></p> <p><span id="s962">A: No way.</span> <span id="s963">No way we felt wrong.</span> <span id="s964">No way we felt we are wrong at all.</span> <span id="s965">After we saw and we saw what they -- what some of their allies -- some of the lackase I call them.</span> <span id="s966">My -- my -- my countrymen were doing for -- for -- for silly thing -- for some trinkets.</span> <span id="s967">The Germans would give them a watch to kill somebody.</span> <span id="s968">Was no -- not at all.</span> <span id="s969">We knew he was a spy and who knew he was doing some bad things.</span> <span id="s970">And he was not jus-just a danger to the Jewish people, but for the whole village people.</span> <span id="s971">They would come and they would -- they would make a parking ou -- a nothing out of the village.</span> <span id="s972">They would massacre with no hesitation at all, the Germans.</span> <span id="s973">You understand?</span> <span id="s974">So there was no buts and no doubts.</span> <span id="s975">But this was not enough for me, I wanted to join up a big group and I wanted actually to go and fight.</span> <span id="s976">And while I was down there in the woods, my sister was a shepherd girl, down there working and I was looking for somebody and all of a sudden, they say a big group of partisans are passing by and I went for curiosity to see, I said maybe, you know, maybe.</span> <span id="s977">They di -- just don’t take you in just because you -- you say -- you are there.</span> <span id="s978">You know, you have to want it, they question you, they ask you.</span> <span id="s979">And while we are standing down there, a big group of partisan on horses, with guns, with machine guns.</span> <span id="s980">With this they are coming -- coming -- I liked it -- I said, “Oh this is -- this is something great -- this is something to fight with.”</span> <span id="s981">And right away there is this officer, I saw he’s a officer, because people were wearing noth-noth -- not uniform, they were partisans, they were all a potpourri, with all kind of clothes, civilian clothes, not civilian clothes, anybody -- whatever you had, they had it.</span> <span id="s982">But this -- this -- this command -- this officer had a -- had a uniform.</span> <span id="s983">And we saw by his -- by his coming across to us, that he is some kind of ranking officer.</span> <span id="s984">So he came up to us and I was standing there with another girl and we exchanged some niceties and I said to him -- I was the brave one, I said, “I wanted to go in and fight with you.”</span> <span id="s985">I said, “Would you fight?”</span> <span id="s986">I said, “Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s987">You’ll teach me, I’ll fight.”</span> <span id="s988">He said, “I’m not in authority tell you yes and no.”</span> <span id="s989">He went back to his general -- and he was actually the -- next to the general, the commissar they call him.</span> <span id="s990">Politic-Political advisor at that time.</span> <span id="s991">Commissar -- it was a political advisor.</span> <span id="s992">He went to the general, he came back and he said, “If you wanted to come, if you’ll fight.”</span> <span id="s993">I said, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s994">“Now or never.”</span> <span id="s995">I decided right there and then I’m going.</span> <span id="s996">But I had to let words to my sister.</span> <span id="s997">That’s how I went.</span> <span id="s998">I said to some of the peasants, I wasn’t sure they’ll tell her or not tell her, she’ll think that’s it, that’s the end of me.</span> <span id="s999">Anyway, I went with some -- a few more Jewish girls, we went and we -- we stationed by 10 kilometers from that destination where I started, where it was like my home state on there.</span> <span id="s1000">Where it started it, it was like 10 or maybe 50, I don’t know exactly, but this is the distance.</span> <span id="s1001">Down there we stopped, in that village, for at night and I was assigned to a group.</span> <span id="s1002">I went right away to my commanding officer, I told him that I left a sister.</span> <span id="s1003">And I told him she doesn’t know where I am and she -- she’ll think that I am already killed.</span> <span id="s1004">“What is your advice?”</span> <span id="s1005">I ask him, “What do you s -- what do you think?”</span> <span id="s1006">He says to me -- he thought for awhile and he says to me, “You know what?</span> <span id="s1007">Maybe we can solve the problem.</span> <span id="s1008">I’ll give you my horse.”</span> <span id="s1009">Something -- he liked something about me -- a very fine man.</span> <span id="s1010">“I’ll give you my adjutant.</span> <span id="s1011">Go back to your sister and tell her that you are in a fighting unit now.”</span> <span id="s1012">I went back with this adjutant and he was sumpalese attatar -- attatar.</span> <span id="s1013">And he told me some stories that was fascinating to me at that time.</span> <span id="s1014">We exchanged slice, the -- we exchanged jokes and these and I told him about my life.</span> <span id="s1015">And it was such a camaraderie right away.</span> <span id="s1016">And -- and he said, there’s four barriers, you know, he said that they were -- they were, you know, sculpcatters or something, four barriers, [indecipherable] on their back, you know, he said -- and it was so -- you know, it was funny.</span> <span id="s1017">And we came to the destination where my sister was, to the house where actually I lived in the deep woods, I walked up -- I got off now -- he gave me his horse, he showed me the first time -- showed me how to mount the horse and that’s was my first encounter.</span> <span id="s1018">I mounted the horse, I went with him and we proceeded til we came to the -- the house.</span> <span id="s1019">I walked up to the vil -- to the woman -- to the -- to the housekeeper -- to the -- to the hostess of the house where my sister and I lived.</span> <span id="s1020">My sister was someplace with the cattles, sh -- as a shepherd girl.</span> <span id="s1021">I walked up to her and [indecipherable] “She’s the only one,” I said to her.</span> <span id="s1022">“Now you are responsible for her, I’m going to fight.</span> <span id="s1023">Now you’re responsible.</span> <span id="s1024">If something will happen to her, remember, I’ll come for revenge.”</span> <span id="s1025">I didn’t have to say nothing more.</span> <span id="s1026">I said, “I’ll burn your house with no hesitation and I’ll take your life.”</span> <span id="s1027">And -- and it was straight to the point.</span> <span id="s1028">She knew it exactly because she knew it.</span> <span id="s1029">And they were anyway on our side -- on our side.</span> <span id="s1030">I left there and I came back to my -- to my unit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">Q: I have a few questions about -- about that -- that whole time period.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">Q: You -- yo-you -- was your sister still involved with Shimone’s partisan group at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">A: No.</span> <span id="s1035">Shimone -- Shimone -- each was already on his own, you know.</span> <span id="s1036">There were already groups there, groups here.</span> <span id="s1037">This was in the beginning, but then start bigger partisan groups down there go -- coming in, so each one was already on his own.</span> <span id="s1038">Yeah, this is a good -- I -- I -- I -- yeah, this is very -- to clarify this.</span> <span id="s1039">Was only so on, so I with my sister, my cousin and my uncle was someplace else.</span> <span id="s1040">But we used to see once in awhile each other, sometimes by coincidence, sometimes -- a coincidence more -- more than -- than anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">Q: So your sister was just -- had -- had been taken in even before you joined this --</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Q: Large fighting unit.</span> <span id="s1044">She had been taking in -- taken in by a f -- a farming family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">A: A farm -- and not taken, we -- we were down there, we lived down there with this farm woman, we stayed in their hou -- we used to sleep, it was deep, deep in the woods.</span> <span id="s1046">I used to help her out in the fields in -- and there she would give us a little bit of food -- little food down there, that’s all.</span> <span id="s1047">And my sister was a s-shepherd girl.</span> <span id="s1048">It was a help for her and she -- I don’t -- she didn’t had a husband.</span> <span id="s1049">I don’t know where her husband was -- or died or in the war, I don’t know what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">Q: How long had you and your sister actually been with Shimone’s group then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A: Maybe a few months, that’s all.</span> <span id="s1052">Maybe not that -- very short.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">Q: And then you -- you decided or -- how did that happen that -- that you -- you separated from Shimone’s group and started living with this woman?</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">A: Shimone had already -- his agenda -- a Zion, you understand?</span> <span id="s1055">His agenda.</span> <span id="s1056">He wanted also to join.</span> <span id="s1057">He went away, he wa -- he was with another man and he went to some kind of group, I don’t know exactly, but we were separated from him and he couldn’t take responsibi -- [indecipherable] with the woman and children because, you know, each one of the -- on his own.</span> <span id="s1058">And that’s what we separate -- it’s a little bit you know, you know, now it’s cla -- clear to you more -- clearer to you, the way I describe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">Q: Yes, it’s clearer and -- but I also want to know what Shimone’s group’s objective was.</span> <span id="s1060">Were they involved in acts of sabotage or did they fight at all or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">A: No, they were just still -- they went in in a partisan group.</span> <span id="s1062">They just were watching over us and -- and then they were looking also for a -- for a partisan group to join them - to join.</span> <span id="s1063">And they joined some other partisan group.</span> <span id="s1064">Actually, the friend of his, Onshineski, I will never forget -- he died in fighting by putting mines on the -- the railroad.</span> <span id="s1065">He was -- he was -- he died.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">Q: So there were -- there were no women and children in -- in Shimone’s group then, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">A: In Shimone’s -- in Shimone’s group before he went to the partisans.</span> <span id="s1068">When he went to the partisan, that’s it.</span> <span id="s1069">The -- if there were children, they were not such a thing and there were children and women there, they stayed separately or they had a place for them.</span> <span id="s1070">For instance, in our unit, we didn’t had such a thing, because we were a moving -- a moving partisan unit.</span> <span id="s1071">We constantly moved, so we didn’t had no place.</span> <span id="s1072">If there is some children or something -- some airplanes sometimes used to land in the woods for us.</span> <span id="s1073">So they used to take the very wounded one, the very important partisan, they used to take him back to Moscow, then to a hospital or something, but on rare occasion.</span> <span id="s1074">But in mostly of the occasion, we stayed in -- down there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">Q: Okay, that’s much clearer.</span> <span id="s1076">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">A: Yeah, okay -- it’s -- it’s good because you know when I -- when I -- it’s my story, so I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">Q: And you’re -- the -- the larger group that you joined up with, tell me the name, if you remember the name of your commanding officer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">A: The commanding officer was Major General Naoomoff.</span> <span id="s1080">I don’t know his first name, but Naoomoff was his -- his -- and that’s the way he went by.</span> <span id="s1081">General Naoomoff.</span> <span id="s1082">And he started something, I -- I don’t know the history of his thing he started with five or six hundred and then they grow up of proportion.</span> <span id="s1083">After 15 or 16 hundred.</span> <span id="s1084">And there were also a mixture of people, I say that potpourri of people.</span> <span id="s1085">There were POW’s, you’ll ask me, “Who were those people?”</span> <span id="s1086">They were POW’s, who their fate was as bad as -- as the Jewish fate.</span> <span id="s1087">They -- they used to kill them off like -- like -- like nothing and a lody escapees from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1088">And some who were belonging -- used to belong to the Communist party -- of the -- maybe they went down there, I don’t know who were -- the enemies of the Germans and they’re afraid the Germans is going to kill them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">Q: And you mentioned in the first interview that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">A: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q: That your unit was getting orders from Moscow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">Q: Of -- of what -- what actions you were to take.</span> <span id="s1094">Were they affiliated with the Russian army then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">A: No, we had our headquarters, our partisan headquarters in Moscow.</span> <span id="s1096">They -- we had a radio station in one of -- one -- the girl, Varla.</span> <span id="s1097">There were three people in the radio, working constantly.</span> <span id="s1098">Transmitting, receiving telegrams, telling us how the movement, where to go.</span> <span id="s1099">We used to know the news from the -- from actually from the front.</span> <span id="s1100">We used to -- they used to get us, the partisans and tell us every good news.</span> <span id="s1101">It was a big rejoicing for us, you understand, every knock, every hell for the Germans was a good -- good music for us.</span> <span id="s1102">And so we -- we -- they were working constantly and we had assignment.</span> <span id="s1103">Like for instance, we started from White Russia, I can show you on the map.</span> <span id="s1104">We went from White Russia, via the woods, we went -- we had our assign -- our -- our orders to go via -- via -- up to the Carpathian mountains.</span> <span id="s1105">Tee inflict hell on the Germans as much as we could.</span> <span id="s1106">And then when we came to the Carpathian mountains, the front was already advancing very fast, they ask us to come back and then they took -- then they disformed us, they took the ammunition and ev-everybody was, you know, could select what he is going to do with his life and then he is going to doing what.</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">Q: Were there many Jews in this partisan unit?</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">A: A fair maybe -- some percentage, I know you di-didn’t went around to survey who is a Jew, who is not a Jew.</span> <span id="s1109">But somehow we used to sense, we used to know, among us.</span> <span id="s1110">There was some Russian Jews, there were some officers, who didn’t go advertising themselves I’m a Jew, not a Jew, their faith was the same, and the hell we were fighting the -- the same enemy at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">Q: So there wasn’t -- you didn’t sense any discrimination then, for being Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">A: There was some discrimination, but I did not -- you know, I used to tell them back, you know with me they couldn’t go too far.</span> <span id="s1113">You know, I used to g-go tell them, go to hell, any time and they knew it, that I -- I was not, you know.</span> <span id="s1114">I was down there to fight just like they are there.</span> <span id="s1115">You should tell me some funny jokes, why -- why are you here -- why are you not in the ashcan in the -- in the back?</span> <span id="s1116">Why are you have to fight?</span> <span id="s1117">I said, “None of your business.”</span> <span id="s1118">And all those things, I used to give them straight hell, right from the beginning.</span> <span id="s1119">So they didn’t had too far to go as far I’m concerned.</span> <span id="s1120">And I -- I didn’t feel, not exactly.</span> <span id="s1121">Because the assignments were the same, the fights were the same, we went in the same thing -- same -- same places, same things.</span> <span id="s1122">So I did not, this is no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">Q: It sounds like you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">A: And I didn’t look for -- I -- maybe I didn’t -- I don’t know, I did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">Q: You -- it sounds like you were a very self-confident young woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">A: Maybe, I don’t know, maybe.</span> <span id="s1127">I -- I felt that I didn’t see no other -- no -- no other ways.</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">Q: So you didn’t -- you didn’t doubt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">A: I didn’t -- I didn’t get out -- I didn’t went around with a -- with a placard over -- you understand?</span> <span id="s1130">I did not.</span> <span id="s1131">What -- if they ask me, I said it.</span> <span id="s1132">I lost my family, I used to -- I’d tell them the way -- the way it happened.</span> <span id="s1133">And of course the officers and that -- he knew that.</span> <span id="s1134">A for instance, I -- when we -- we had an order coming from White Russia.</span> <span id="s1135">We had to go into miciedis army.</span> <span id="s1136">My general knew that I’m from down there someplace.</span> <span id="s1137">And I was in the group.</span> <span id="s1138">It was quite a honorary thing -- assignment.</span> <span id="s1139">I was in the group the cult commandantskits wart.</span> <span id="s1140">Actually, who -- End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning of Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Brenda Senders.</span> <span id="s1142">This is tape number two, side B.</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">A: So I was in this commandantskits wart, this is a -- a honorary, you know, actually to -- you are responsible for the -- for the general, for your commanding officer.</span> <span id="s1144">And -- and it was -- it was -- I felt good about it.</span> <span id="s1145">And we had to pass by my city and somehow the orders, I didn’t know about it, the orders came that we are going to go and my general came up to me, he said, “Brennaslava,” he used to call me Brennaslava.</span> <span id="s1146">He used to call me Brennaslava, you know, in Russian.</span> <span id="s1147">“Brennaslava, we are going -- maybe we’ll go into your city.</span> <span id="s1148">Do you have some accounts to pay?”</span> <span id="s1149">I said, “Yes, I have a few of them.”</span> <span id="s1150">And -- but we never walked -- we never.</span> <span id="s1151">We had to surv pass -- we had to g -- pass by the city of Sarnee.</span> <span id="s1152">We never went in, we went in on our destination because you know, it’s not written in stone during the war, it changes from minute to minute and the orders and everything because the strategic point and thing and the fights and the retreating of the army and all those things.</span> <span id="s1153">One thing I know, we gave them hell.</span> <span id="s1154">Whatever m-my human mind could -- could ever think about it.</span> <span id="s1155">That’s what we inflicted on the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">Q: I’m trying to decide between two questions.</span> <span id="s1157">Okay, what -- how many other women were there in the group?</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">A: I would say 10 percent.</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">Q: 10 percent?</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">A: Maybe so, maybe more.</span> <span id="s1161">I don’t -- something.</span> <span id="s1162">I had always my friend Taska, she was like a tomboy.</span> <span id="s1163">She -- I always have a good feeling about her.</span> <span id="s1164">Taska, I used to go right all -- al-always with her.</span> <span id="s1165">And the guys, oh they would not bu-budge with her.</span> <span id="s1166">She used to give them hell, straight.</span> <span id="s1167">From start to the end.</span> <span id="s1168">But we had about 10 percent and her sister -- she was married, oh -- that’s why her fiancé -- she fell in alive to the German hands.</span> <span id="s1169">And this was a tragedy.</span> <span id="s1170">Because alive -- or maybe she killed herself because every partisan was encouraged -- they have a grenade with him, in case he fell ins the Germans, he should kill himself.</span> <span id="s1171">Because we knew that they will ki -- cu -- not just they will -- they will torture you to death, they will want extract some information.</span> <span id="s1172">But you didn’t know and if you knew -- if you know the information, you wouldn’t give them.</span> <span id="s1173">Do you understand?</span> <span id="s1174">There was a -- a very vicious circle.</span> <span id="s1175">So every partisan knew there is -- we can not give ourselves alive to the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">Q: You must have gone through some kind of training.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">A: We did.</span> <span id="s1178">Very fast ones.</span> <span id="s1179">We used to stop in the village -- I remember we had a major who used to take us out to show us, you know, to ride -- riding the horse -- but this is what -- not important.</span> <span id="s1180">Other time -- but anyway, he was showing us how to ride or take a lower part, to go fast or to go slow, whatever.</span> <span id="s1181">And then we used to have targets, what we used to -- shooting targets, actually we sh -- came down there and we used to -- we used to train ourselves.</span> <span id="s1182">It was not too long, but it’s -- it’s not a big theory, you know soon, but you have to do it, you do it fast.</span> <span id="s1183">If your life -- if your life is at stake, you understand?</span> <span id="s1184">You do it.</span> <span id="s1185">Or you do it or you die, one of those two things.</span> <span id="s1186">There was no -- nothing -- nothing in between.</span> <span id="s1187">And because I choose life, maybe I’m here still.</span> <span id="s1188">And maybe, I don’t know, sometimes I think maybe I -- I was braver than my brains [inaudible].</span> <span id="s1189">But here still I am utathi.</span> <span id="s1190">Against all the odds, I survived.</span> <span id="s1191">So there is rhyme or reason, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1192">Maybe you can tell me, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">Q: You were am -- one among relatively few women and you were -- you -- it sounds as if -- correct me if I’m wrong, that you had the same role to play as the men.</span> <span id="s1194">That you were fighting and you were involved -- I gather from your first interview -- in acts of sabotage --</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">Q: And was there -- was that unusual?</span> <span id="s1197">Were women given -- were women generally given these -- these roles within the group?</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1199">It depends in the group where I stood on watch or I stood on watch or I had to pull the trigger or whatever it is, it was nothing.</span> <span id="s1200">That was -- you know -- the guys there were more -- more -- knew -- knew more, so they went ahead, where they were already experienced in this particular thing, they were went ahead.</span> <span id="s1201">If I had to go, I went with him.</span> <span id="s1202">Let’s say if you had to put the -- we used to call TNT on the -- the railroad, like little squares, TNT?</span> <span id="s1203">This is -- you know -- and then were a detonator or we used to make -- very primitive, with a long string and then you put a -- a -- you put a -- a match and then it’s goes and it’s explodes.</span> <span id="s1204">But we used to do it in three, four places, because the Germans would -- would put it back -- the rails -- in one, two, three, you understand?</span> <span id="s1205">If it was in one place, but in three places, they would derail and then we had time to make our -- a hell out of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">Q: Who was responsible for domestic chores like laundry and cooking and so forth?</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">A: Each one.</span> <span id="s1208">Each one was his own, okay?</span> <span id="s1209">We went -- in the woods for instance, I used to come in the woods -- I think that’s funny -- I used to come in the woods and I use -- I -- I -- I’m a c -- I’m a clean person by then, so I used to take another girl and I used to put a little -- a little like whatever I had, around me and take a little water and wash myself, you know, wash mys -- cold as it was, you know -- below zero, how much we had snow down there and it’s -- it’s -- it’s -- it’s cold as -- as hell down there in my country that I come from, in the winter.</span> <span id="s1210">And anyway, in maybe this I was not sick, you know, because I haven myself.</span> <span id="s1211">Because we did not -- you know, and I used to wash my body usadine and then when we go into a village, we occupy a village or we stationed in a house and in the house there were water, I used to get water from the well and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">Q: How did you get food?</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">A: By acquiring, by going -- you are people with guns.</span> <span id="s1214">You go in, nobody would say no to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">Q: So you would never -- you would never cook in the woods or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">A: Yeah, there is some instances what we did, but mostly no, because there are --sometimes we used to go parallel with the Germans and this was a no-no, we’re not allowed.</span> <span id="s1217">The Germans used to go on the highway, we used to go straight to them, to inflict on them damage, whenever we -- it’s a possibility, whenever we ne -- we had to.</span> <span id="s1218">We used to go parallel, they would go on the -- on the highway, we would go parallel in the woods.</span> <span id="s1219">And I know for a fact and I said it in -- down there I think on the tape.</span> <span id="s1220">I know it.</span> <span id="s1221">The Germans were afraid they went to go in to relieve themself in the woods.</span> <span id="s1222">Because they knew that something is awaiting them.</span> <span id="s1223">They used to be scared of the eastern front like hell, because they knew the damage they were -- they had done to the people and what kind of hatred we had against them.</span> <span id="s1224">So, this is what my -- my reward against them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">Q: Did you have -- so -- so there are hundreds of -- of people in this group and everyone -- am I right to -- it sounds like everyone shared everything, nobody had a real special job -- a special task that they were responsible for?</span> <span id="s1226">What kind of organization was there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">A: Well for instance -- a for instance, yeah, the radio operator, they had three -- they had three people were working constantly radio.</span> <span id="s1228">There were demolition, you know, what you go into -- then -- they were sending each time another group or another people or sometimes the same, it depends, because we were moving constantly.</span> <span id="s1229">A -- for an instance, we were in the -- we occupied a village -- let me give you a s -- a example so you -- you understand the magnitude.</span> <span id="s1230">We occupied a village.</span> <span id="s1231">I was in the group at that time, who -- we occupy a certain destination.</span> <span id="s1232">You put in a -- you put it in a -- on the entrance of the village and the exit of the village or -- or both entrances of the village, you put it in like a machine gun, a guns, a few -- a few sentries, a machine gun and you allowed people to walk -- to get into the village, but nobody’s allowed to get out from the village.</span> <span id="s1233">And I remember we occupied one village in -- it was on the -- on -- on the eastern -- not far from Shitoma.</span> <span id="s1234">Someplace not far from -- in that direction.</span> <span id="s1235">And we walked in -- it was -- our village was in the valley and -- and it was surrounded with little hills.</span> <span id="s1236">And somebody must -- if the Germans find out -- in the morning we were surrounded from the hills by the Germans and they have the better position on us, because we were in the valley, we were in the -- on the -- on the bottom.</span> <span id="s1237">As I was at -- razvere -- no -- right, yeah.</span> <span id="s1238">So I -- we needed some ammunition to get.</span> <span id="s1239">The surplus of ammunition was down there, like three or four houses away.</span> <span id="s1240">We used to get it in the horse and buggy, on wagons, you understand?</span> <span id="s1241">It was not suffish to get at now.</span> <span id="s1242">This on horse and buggy, it was on wagons.</span> <span id="s1243">So the -- we needed, for the machine gun, we needed some bullets.</span> <span id="s1244">And -- and our commanding officer said, “I need the bullets.”</span> <span id="s1245">You know, we saw it already, surrounded by the Germans.</span> <span id="s1246">And I said, “I know exactly how to go the back way and I’ll go.”</span> <span id="s1247">And I went the back way, I went out down there to the horse and buggy, I got the ammunition, I got the -- the -- the -- a whole big bag of ammunition, of the bullets for the -- for the -- for the machine gun and by coming back, already the houses, where I had to go to hide myself -- to -- to crawl under them, was already burning.</span> <span id="s1248">The -- the -- because we have straw in our country, that’s straw on the -- on the -- on the -- on the thing.</span> <span id="s1249">So right away they put it in, they -- they throw in some bullets, it starts a fire.</span> <span id="s1250">In the straw it started right there and then.</span> <span id="s1251">So when I was coming back with the bullets, already each house was on fire.</span> <span id="s1252">I ran in and I remember I tumbled under the -- the house with my -- with my bullets trawling behind -- grabbing, schlepping like with me.</span> <span id="s1253">And I walked up and I had to go from one -- from one house to another one.</span> <span id="s1254">I tumbled again, I went in and down there I saw my partisan friend.</span> <span id="s1255">Ivania was his name.</span> <span id="s1256">I yelled to him, he was laying -- because I recognized him by his -- by his -- by his -- by his dress, by his red jacket, a shepherd jacket -- in sh-sheepskin jacket.</span> <span id="s1257">So I recognize -- I said, “Ivania, cover me, it’s me, we should start shooting and I can go by.”</span> <span id="s1258">He didn’t responded to me and I got mad and I start yelling at him because I thought he’s -- he’s -- he’s co -- y-you know, a coward there -- he -- he’s -- he’s scared.</span> <span id="s1259">But Ivania was dead.</span> <span id="s1260">A sniper got straight to his head, because the next day was the funeral.</span> <span id="s1261">Anyway, I tumbled through it, I went down through a well.</span> <span id="s1262">You know the wells, you know, like a l -- during Lincoln times and everything here, I [indecipherable] the well and I came to my unit and I gave them -- handed them the -- the bullet.</span> <span id="s1263">They said it also.</span> <span id="s1264">He sighted ee, my -- my -- my officer -- when he -- when I came in, I brought them in there.</span> <span id="s1265">And one time my general told me, “Brenda, you’ll live a long life.”</span> <span id="s1266">And I say always, maybe he predicted right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">Q: And why did he say that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">A: Because I came from another -- from another -- I left my bullet -- my bullet belt and I went also to the -- I di -- I told them the thing in the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">Q: Yeah, that story is in the -- is in the [indecipherable], yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">A: So when I came back, he said it, you will live a long life.</span> <span id="s1271">Wesided because I pinched myself and I ran into the woods.</span> <span id="s1272">And then we had to retreat.</span> <span id="s1273">We had to -- we had to deceive the Germans too, in any way we could.</span> <span id="s1274">So we came, the fight ended a few hours and then a plane came.</span> <span id="s1275">We used to call it the Rama and this is like a -- a frame plane.</span> <span id="s1276">And this -- the frame plane used to take -- used to take pictures of the terrain and of us and of moving things and we knew it -- this -- this plane will go away within a f -- an hour or two, we’ll have bombs on our heads.</span> <span id="s1277">So we have to skedoodle, we have to get out from there very fast.</span> <span id="s1278">So we left some old rags, I remember at that time, some old horses, some old things what they could not be taking with us, to pretend that we are still down there and we moved out.</span> <span id="s1279">And I remember there was big opening, a big clearing in the woods.</span> <span id="s1280">They asked the partisans to go backwards, like -- like to step backwards.</span> <span id="s1281">They should -- when he comes with the plane to -- to take a look, so they see these people get in, but not out.</span> <span id="s1282">But actually we -- this was our deceiving them.</span> <span id="s1283">And we went around the clearing.</span> <span id="s1284">And after -- and after in a few hours, the bombs came.</span> <span id="s1285">We asked the people of the village -- we told them -- we warned them, everybody run for your life, because they will be on your backs.</span> <span id="s1286">And it was that way, within a few hours.</span> <span id="s1287">The planes were there and they made a mess out of the village and the people who were -- who were down there left over, they were all dead.</span> <span id="s1288">And we were behind them.</span> <span id="s1289">We were spectators.</span> <span id="s1290">We were standing in the woods far away and we were seeing the whole -- the whole thing, the whole happening, what’s happened.</span> <span id="s1291">I remember standing next to Taska, you must remember Taska -- Taska.</span> <span id="s1292">I was standing down there and was still -- was a happening.</span> <span id="s1293">There was this -- Varla was her name, one from the radio station.</span> <span id="s1294">She used to write a daily -- dai -- a -- a nievnik we call it, you know, a -- a diary.</span> <span id="s1295">And -- and it struck me at one point very funny because here we are fighting anee.</span> <span id="s1296">I used to ask her -- Varla -- we -- we liked each other and I said, “Varla, do you think we will read -- we will live through to see it?”</span> <span id="s1297">She said, “Okay, I’m -- I’m -- I think we will.”</span> <span id="s1298">I said, “I have hopes we will.”</span> <span id="s1299">And she did.</span> <span id="s1300">And I did [inaudible] here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">Q: Were you limited in any way, being a -- being a girl -- a -- a young woman in this situation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">A: That was not a easy task, but I stood my ground.</span> <span id="s1303">I said it’s not the time, not for romance, it’s not the thing, I didn’t want none of those.</span> <span id="s1304">There were boys and you know, I was attractive, I would say.</span> <span id="s1305">I tried, you know, to be.</span> <span id="s1306">I pushed away.</span> <span id="s1307">I said it’s not the time, it’s not the place to get involved in what’s then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">Q: Did anyone question your ability as a fighter?</span> <span id="s1309">Being a young woman, were you limited in that way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">A: No.</span> <span id="s1311">They didn’t question my ability.</span> <span id="s1312">We were learning how to shoot -- how to -- to throw a grenade, that’s not a big theory.</span> <span id="s1313">You -- you want it, you -- you know, you -- you wanted to do it.</span> <span id="s1314">So questioning was not or you didn’t do the job, so they -- you had to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">Q: So they didn’t reserve certain jobs for men and other jobs for women?</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">A: I don’t know, maybe there were some.</span> <span id="s1317">I -- I -- on assignments, I remember the first time the general -- I was -- was riding in the -- in this group and he send me -- I didn’t know even it was such a dangerous -- a mission.</span> <span id="s1318">He send me to another village, then th -- he told me a name, so and so and so.</span> <span id="s1319">He gave me some -- a piece of paper, then I -- I had to bring him some information from down there.</span> <span id="s1320">Even I came back, I was so shy in dahell, I was shy.</span> <span id="s1321">I had to report to him.</span> <span id="s1322">I was standing behind the door, I remember, til I walked in and I said, “You know, my mission’s accomplish in this.”</span> <span id="s1323">And it was a dangerous mission because, you know, I was all alone and somebody could ambush me, it could be the end of me.</span> <span id="s1324">But, you know, you don't think in the moment when you are involved in it.</span> <span id="s1325">You wanted to live, but -- and you’re always on the watch, you’re always, you know -- that nobody should get you.</span> <span id="s1326">I remember once standing in the woods, all by myself and -- and any -- I was so -- I was so hyper.</span> <span id="s1327">Any -- you know, there were birds, there were thing, it was cold, it was already in -- in -- in har -- in -- you know, not spring, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">Q: Fall?</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">A: Fall.</span> <span id="s1330">And, you know, some birds, some snakes, some little animals in there.</span> <span id="s1331">And I was standing in there by myself and it’s away from the company, away from the group, from the partisans.</span> <span id="s1332">I had to be like a warning shot, if somebody comes in, I should give a warning shot to them.</span> <span id="s1333">And I stood on there for a few hours and it was, you know, I get chills in my back.</span> <span id="s1334">You understand?</span> <span id="s1335">Because I was afraid it’s not just so -- that somebody from a tree should jump on me, you understand?</span> <span id="s1336">Bu -- sh -- ch -- somebody from a tree should jump on me and overpower me.</span> <span id="s1337">Not because -- because I was ready with my gun, I was ready to s -- to -- to take my position -- to do whatever I had to.</span> <span id="s1338">But you understand, it was -- because I was alone and I felt a little bit uneasy at that time.</span> <span id="s1339">So this was every day there happened and it’s a constant, constant.</span> <span id="s1340">And there were guys, they are brave -- they are -- they were fighters -- they were -- they -- I know we paved the way to liberation.</span> <span id="s1341">We paved the way.</span> <span id="s1342">And in the eyes of the military, we looked like heroes to them.</span> <span id="s1343">I didn’t know even, at that time.</span> <span id="s1344">We looked -- be-because they knew we were volunteers, we went to fight -- fight them to the end.</span> <span id="s1345">And we did and they’re af -- they’re afraid of us like -- they used to send divisions to get the partisan -- to find the partisans.</span> <span id="s1346">They never did.</span> <span id="s1347">Of course we had a lody of -- of -- on our side too, a lody -- a lody, y-you know, whatever you say -- of fallen soldiers, some were -- were without legs, some without -- hand.</span> <span id="s1348">And I remember penicillin came into our midst, you know, the Americans send us penicillin, a lot of our partisans were helped by the penicillin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">Q: Did you have doctors or n-nurses among you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">A: We had a bath surgeon, yeah -- I’m sorry -- we had a surgeon and assistant and a doctor.</span> <span id="s1351">Valentina was her name and she was also very friendly with me.</span> <span id="s1352">But the surgeon used to perform surgery right on the spot.</span> <span id="s1353">Sometimes he could not succeed, because the winter and the hind and the infection and the limited of -- of -- of medication.</span> <span id="s1354">But the penicillin helped some of them because the gangrene wouldn’t -- wouldn’t set it.</span> <span id="s1355">The -- the infection would fight off.</span> <span id="s1356">And we had always nice words, you know, I never -- they ask me how, many times.</span> <span id="s1357">They had the [indecipherable] words against the Americans, no.</span> <span id="s1358">The nicest [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1359">And don’t forget, they were allies of ours.</span> <span id="s1360">Then, of course, politically.</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1362">Why don’t you tell me how the -- how you learned that the war ended.</span> <span id="s1363">Were you -- were you with the partisans at that time?</span> <span id="s1364">Which happened first?</span> <span id="s1365">The Jew -- did the partisans disband or did the war end first?</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">A: Partisan disband because the front was advancing so fast, this -- the partisans we didn’t had no -- no more -- they were -- they were chased out from Poland and they were going such an afr -- in a very fast pace.</span> <span id="s1367">That’s -- we -- that says our job was accomplished.</span> <span id="s1368">So we -- we were asked to come and we -- we disbanded.</span> <span id="s1369">And take away our ammunition and then we came to the city of Rovno and then there, we gave our ammunition and each one -- they ask what -- our whole commission of people, they ask who wants to do what.</span> <span id="s1370">I thought for a strangid idea to go in to take some languages and to go to college, where they would -- to go to the university, but they would have helped me at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">Q: Who would have helped you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">A: From the partisan headquarters.</span> <span id="s1373">They would have helped me because I was fighting during the war.</span> <span id="s1374">They would give me maybe even a tutor to prepare me.</span> <span id="s1375">But then I had my sister and somehow it -- everything it changed.</span> <span id="s1376">And then start the movement of leaving in the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s1377">People start leaving the Soviet Union and going up west.</span> <span id="s1378">And I decided I had it enough.</span> <span id="s1379">I didn’t had nobody.</span> <span id="s1380">I lost everybody and I don’t want to be on the bloody heart any more.</span> <span id="s1381">It was too painful.</span> <span id="s1382">I looked in everybody’s eyes and I was ashame of myself.</span> <span id="s1383">I said, “Maybe they were helping the Germans to find little kids, little Jewish children.”</span> <span id="s1384">They were kids, they were adorable as I remember them.</span> <span id="s1385">So I decided to leave.</span> <span id="s1386">And I remember when the war -- the war ended and they announced on the radio.</span> <span id="s1387">So they came to the municipality.</span> <span id="s1388">And there were rockets and there were big festivities and people were rejoicing and I rejoiced of course with them, because the evil was conquered, it was down to earth, was -- was -- was beaten to -- to the ground.</span> <span id="s1389">But I -- I looked left and I looked right and I did not laugh or to -- or to cry, because I lost everybody.</span> <span id="s1390">And I’m -- it was among those people living for centuries.</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">Q: Had you had any chance to grieve, up until that point, for your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">A: You know, it’s funny, no, you know, I didn’t.</span> <span id="s1393">You know what struck me very much, though?</span> <span id="s1394">When I gave my ammunition back and I came up to Dubnow, was a city, Dubnow and I came right away, I asked some Jewish people alive, so they used to point it out, this house, that house.</span> <span id="s1395">And I came to one house and I -- we were like a novelty, I and I have a friend of mine.</span> <span id="s1396">A novelty when we told them we were partisans, we were fighting, we were healthy looking.</span> <span id="s1397">And they came out, they were all, you know, white face, they were hiding, they were doing whatever, I don’t remember, even.</span> <span id="s1398">And there was some kind of rabbi, all was hut in there amongst them who survived.</span> <span id="s1399">And I told him -- he asked me, I said, “My parents.”</span> <span id="s1400">And he said kaddish and that’s what struck me, right then and then, you understand?</span> <span id="s1401">Because I was busy constantly, with fighting, with doing the things I was doing.</span> <span id="s1402">But that’s -- that’s when it struck me really hard.</span> <span id="s1403">And I -- and I saw the reality of the whole thing.</span> <span id="s1404">And that’s -- that’s -- I -- I -- and another thing.</span> <span id="s1405">When I came -- we erected -- the survivors -- there survived a few survivors from my town.</span> <span id="s1406">We decided to erect on the place where they murdered the -- the -- the thousand and thousands of people, we decided to put on there a monument.</span> <span id="s1407">When I came down there after the place, because I escaped from that enclosure -- we cut the barbed wire, we ran out.</span> <span id="s1408">The rest of the people were taken over the hills, were taken a kilometer or two in the woods and down there -- ditches were prepared and they did it -- what they did in every other place.</span> <span id="s1409">The same thing, I understand.</span> <span id="s1410">I was not there because I wouldn’t be here.</span> <span id="s1411">And so -- so when I came down there and we came down there and we were standing down there, over the place actually, you know, where my parents, my little sister, my little brother maybe down there lay.</span> <span id="s1412">You know I couldn’t -- I couldn’t put a tear out of my eyes.</span> <span id="s1413">I stood down there like a -- like a stone.</span> <span id="s1414">I -- in -- and it made me angry, you understand?</span> <span id="s1415">It made me mad like hell.</span> <span id="s1416">Because something is in -- I feel the pain and here I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1417">I couldn’t express it outside.</span> <span id="s1418">Then of course, you know, little by little, the start pouring out -- out of me.</span> <span id="s1419">But it was very sad.</span> <span id="s1420">Very sad and very unjust, what I was looking the unjustnessty.</span> <span id="s1421">Th-The terrible thing was down -- my family was a beautiful family.</span> <span id="s1422">We were not rich materially, but my father was, I think, you know -- I look at the pictures sometimes, the kids say he looks like Prince Philips.</span> <span id="s1423">I says, “He was a prince in his own right.”</span> <span id="s1424">He was a -- he was a great man.</span> <span id="s1425">He was a good man.</span> <span id="s1426">He was helping his fellow citizen, he was helping his fellow -- whatever he could.</span> <span id="s1427">He was in the forest, if somebody needed some wood for the house to build, he used help him out.</span> <span id="s1428">Because the -- he knew their -- their struggle.</span> <span id="s1429">You understand, he knew their strugg -- and he was good by heart.</span> <span id="s1430">Our son is just like it -- like -- like his grandfather.</span> <span id="s1431">So this is -- this is all the -- the things what -- what has struck me very, very badly.</span> <span id="s1432">If you didn’t have time to grieve, where do you -- how -- how do you?</span> <span id="s1433">We were all the same, we used to talk and we used to reminisce and we used to tell how and what and that’s about that.</span> <span id="s1434">We -- we -- had no -- to go to psychiatrist or to do those things, we just in our own heads, in our own thing, we made -- and at least we accomplished something.</span> <span id="s1435">When I saw -- when I saw the crushing of their army -- the big superman, they were not supermen.</span> <span id="s1436">Hitler taught them mean they are supermen.</span> <span id="s1437">Of course they were supermen against women and children.</span> <span id="s1438">Against women and children, was supermen.</span> <span id="s1439">Because they had the guns, we were not prepared for them.</span> <span id="s1440">But they were not supermen after they start getting a beating.</span> <span id="s1441">The partisan gave them from one side and then the army, they retreat and under Stalingrad.</span> <span id="s1442">I think that was the beginning of the defeat.</span> <span id="s1443">In the winters in Russia.</span> <span id="s1444">And he -- he paid a price.</span> <span id="s1445">It’s not enough, the way I see it, but that’s -- at least.</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">Q: Did you learn about the -- what was going on in the concentration camps while you were with the partisans?</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">A: No [inaudible] not at all.</span> <span id="s1448">We didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1449">And the funny part, when I was in Treblinka, that’s what got the guts out of me.</span> <span id="s1450">Treblinka sits in the woods and when I -- we went in -- in Treblinka was one -- one -- one rail -- one -- one train what take you in and it struck me so bad because that’s the end, you understand?</span> <span id="s1451">Like this line, this is it.</span> <span id="s1452">And most of the people were murdered down there, except for some cleaning up, whatever.</span> <span id="s1453">But ever the people were brought down there, that was the end, that was a massacre.</span> <span id="s1454">And this has struck me and the funny part, I looked right and I used to look left, at the homes of the Poles who lived down there and whenever I saw a old house, I said, “Dammit, those people were being down there when those people were bringing in the thousands.</span> <span id="s1455">And they didn’t raise their voices, they didn’t say nothing to nobody.”</span> <span id="s1456">On this I -- I felt very -- and in the woods, was the whole camp situated, with the birds singing in the quietness of that place, in the woods surrounding, I said, “If we partisans would have come down there, you don’t know what we would have done to those Germans.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">Q: When were you there, in Treblinka?</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">A: Two years ago, with the march of the living.</span> <span id="s1459">That’s my first reason back, I never was in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1460">After the war, we find out the tragedy, but during the war, we didn’t know the magnitude of building factories and killing people, they didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1461">He deceived a lot of people, but they -- and I’ll repeat --</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">Q: I’d like to know how you -- how you responded to the news about the camps when you learned about what had happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">A: Terribly, it’s behind -- it’s behind understanding, behind.</span> <span id="s1464">It was -- I don’t know, it was such a -- a struck like a ton of it stroke you -- strike you.</span> <span id="s1465">You know, we knew, we -- I saw it -- we escaped from -- from the execution of my town, I escaped.</span> <span id="s1466">So I knew already it was -- it was whatever it was.</span> <span id="s1467">But in the big cities, with million of people -- with millions of people, to build factories and to massacre those people -- and half he did clandestine and half he did -- he did you know it, for the -- for the not to arouse any suspicion, like in -- in Treblinka the same thing, they said airplanes were not allowed to -- to -- to go over Treblinka, because they didn’t wanted to find out the real -- the real thing, what’s going on down there.</span> <span id="s1468">Because it was in a wooded area, the crematorium and all and the things.</span> <span id="s1469">And some people say some of the local people used to stand and ask the -- the Jewish people, give us your belonging, they are going to kill you anyway.</span> <span id="s1470">Give us -- give us, we need it.</span> <span id="s1471">You don’t need it any more.</span> <span id="s1472">And this was sad and this was very hard to digest.</span> <span id="s1473">So --and I’ll -- and I’ll repeat what a survivor said, Lowrate, Elie Wiesel, by the opening of the museum.</span> <span id="s1474">He said, “How come that the silence of man was matched by the silence of God?”</span> <span id="s1475">And starting from Moscow, Lisbon, London, Washington, they all knew what was going on, except the victims didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1476">How they could permit this and why the railroads were not bombed.</span> <span id="s1477">And this is a question.</span> <span id="s1478">And a answer we must find, each one in us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">Q: Tell me how you were reunited with your sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">A: I came from the partisans and I came straight to my town, to Sarnee.</span> <span id="s1481">And of course I find my sister in the house of those people who they were our friends.</span> <span id="s1482">In the house -- the first people where I left when I ran out and I ran to their house, they took her in and they just -- the -- the -- the sad part of it, they made a maid out of her, instead of accepting her like a part of the family, they made a maid out of her, like they would exploitate the situation because she was a orphan and she didn’t had nobody.</span> <span id="s1483">And when I came down there, they even -- they -- they -- they -- the big lore, they were sitting in the dining room and my sister was sitting in the kitchen like a -- like a little servant and a orphan.</span> <span id="s1484">And that’s what struck me and I told them.</span> <span id="s1485">Very -- I was very, very touched -- very, very hurt.</span> <span id="s1486">And they were our friends.</span> <span id="s1487">And so anyway, what the -- the main -- the main thing, she survived.</span> <span id="s1488">And it’s sels -- or it’s her story to tell how did she.</span> <span id="s1489">She was -- she was plenty times almost killed by the national Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s1490">At one point she escaped from that woman, because they were after her to kill her.</span> <span id="s1491">And somebody tipped her off and she ran a -- she ran away from -- from that house and they -- and -- and she survived.</span> <span id="s1492">So it was one -- one miracle, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1493">I don’t believe in miracles, but somehow.</span> <span id="s1494">I guess miracle a people are making, miracles happen.</span> <span id="s1495">That’s how I find my sister afte-after I came from the war.</span> <span id="s1496">At this -- at those people who were our friends.</span> <span id="s1497">And there were -- I said, I was very hurt by that.</span> <span id="s1498">It’s not a easy task that I’m doing now, but I wanted -- I don’t call the museum a museum, I call it a learning center.</span> <span id="s1499">I call it -- it’s all human beings.</span> <span id="s1500">And it’s not a Jewish problem, it’s a human problem.</span> <span id="s1501">I feel on that we will -- or we will live in peace or we’ll perish like fools.</span> <span id="s1502">It’s a big liga said so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">Q: Do you remember the moment you were reunited with Simma?</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1505">We already, you know, we already trials and tribulation went through.</span> <span id="s1506">She went one way and she was, you know, harassed by the shepherds, by the Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s1507">You know h-how, you know, people can take advantage if they know you don’t have nobody, no protection or nothing.</span> <span id="s1508">They used to harass her, they used to call her names and all kind of thing.</span> <span id="s1509">But this is all things, you know, you can live with, but she lived through and that’s the main thing.</span> <span id="s1510">And she has her own story to tell.</span> <span id="s1511">She was in the orphanage.</span> <span id="s1512">She -- I put her to school, right when we came out from the woods, she went to school.</span> <span id="s1513">I did not proceeded, I wanted to proceed in school, but I never proceeded.</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">Q: Did Sarnee look very different than it had looked before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s1516">It was bombed.</span> <span id="s1517">It was destroyed a half.</span> <span id="s1518">There were holes sinking because that’s a very strategic point, was Sarnee.</span> <span id="s1519">There was this railroad, what a lody trains used to come.</span> <span id="s1520">It was Laviastand, it’s a central station.</span> <span id="s1521">But from all parts of the thing used to come, from Kiev, from this all and were -- somehow they were -- they were -- they were cross -- criss-cross down there in Sarnee.</span> <span id="s1522">And -- and the fights were very fierce right around Sarnee.</span> <span id="s1523">There were some of our people who survived -- End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning of Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Brenda Senders.</span> <span id="s1525">This is tape number three, side A.</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">A: A mess.</span> <span id="s1527">And it was -- it looked like a city deserted.</span> <span id="s1528">Not the same people.</span> <span id="s1529">It used to be always a lot of fun to got out in the street and see people strolling, going -- going about their business, going home, coming from home, young people -- young.</span> <span id="s1530">And this was like -- like -- like not the same.</span> <span id="s1531">A lot of the homes were destroyed, not kept right and -- and a lot of the bombs destroyed -- a lot of the bombs destroyed because it was a strategic point, like I explained to you.</span> <span id="s1532">And so it was not the same.</span> <span id="s1533">It was a sad city.</span> <span id="s1534">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">Q: When was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">A: This was in 1945 -- in 1945, almost the end in June, that’s almost the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">Q: Before -- before the VE day or a -- or after?</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">A: You know, I cannot -- no, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1539">The V day -- the -- the VE day was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">Q: May.</span> <span id="s1541">May eighth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">A: M-May -- in ‘45?</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1544">I’m just wondering if you remember the -- if the war was still going on or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">A: Yeah, the war was still -- I don’t think Berlin -- I don’t remember exactly the dates.</span> <span id="s1546">No, I don’t remember exactly the dates that’s this is -- and it was not of important at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1547">Q: But it was -- it was close to that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">A: It was close, yeah -- yeah.</span> <span id="s1549">Because they are advancing, we knew they are already -- they are dead.</span> <span id="s1550">But -- because they -- they had to still to clean out some pockets of Germans, who these are -- still were fighting with these up til the end.</span> <span id="s1551">But we knew that’s the end, that’s it.</span> <span id="s1552">Germany is -- is under.</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">Q: Did you meet with people you knew in Sarnee, people you had known before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1554">A: I was with them in the woods, but then some of them -- you see when the Soviets -- when the Soviets start retreating, a lot the people went along with them, because they heard some of them, they were scared and they would have just -- they be behind the German -- that they went with them.</span> <span id="s1555">They retreated and then they came back after the war ended.</span> <span id="s1556">They came back, they thought they’ll find some of the family, some of the thing, they didn’t.</span> <span id="s1557">So some of the people returned back to -- to Sarnee.</span> <span id="s1558">Very few I knew.</span> <span id="s1559">And the funny part -- I don’t know if I said in the -- in the original -- when the Soviets came, they start also arresting people and taking them to Siberia.</span> <span id="s1560">At this was -- I’m talking about 1939, when they marched in -- into our country.</span> <span id="s1561">And there were Capitalists they arrested, umtee, Communists, whatever -- any, any -- some slogan, whatever they can atthat.</span> <span id="s1562">They were arresting them and calling them yenna -- yenna joshnie element.</span> <span id="s1563">It’s mean untrustworthy -- unfor --trustworthy people.</span> <span id="s1564">And -- and they took him away to Siberia.</span> <span id="s1565">The tragedy was so terrible, everybody -- they thought that’s the end of those people.</span> <span id="s1566">Everybody cried, it was terrible.</span> <span id="s1567">Little did we knew that their fate was not sealed.</span> <span id="s1568">A lot of them died of s -- maybe down there of heavy -- of hard work -- of the climate, malnutrition, whatever it is.</span> <span id="s1569">But the bulk of them survived.</span> <span id="s1570">We the lucky ones, we all perished, except the exception, including me.</span> <span id="s1571">But I sur -- I -- I escaped by a miracle or whatever.</span> <span id="s1572">And the bullet didn’t strike me, that’s all -- plain as it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1573">Q: How was your health at that point?</span> <span id="s1574">Had you gotten enough to eat through the war?</span> <span id="s1575">Did you feel -- were you fairly strong?</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">A: When I was escaped, I was among the -- the peasants.</span> <span id="s1577">I didn’t -- I didn’t miss any and except salt, I didn’t miss any, you know, it was nothing gourmet food, but potatoes and whatever, not -- it was -- it was enough to eat and enough to survive.</span> <span id="s1578">Potatoes and a piece of bread and -- except salt was scarce.</span> <span id="s1579">I used to sometimes beg the peasant for a little salt, because without this I think the feet start falling on -- there’s something -- it’s something not -- not -- thing happening.</span> <span id="s1580">But otherwise -- otherwise it was okay.</span> <span id="s1581">Not exactly we’re starving.</span> <span id="s1582">In the ghetto was more harsh than after I escaped.</span> <span id="s1583">If not I used to go and get myself potatoes in the field and -- and bring in the woods -- get myself, help myself.</span> <span id="s1584">And get in the fields and -- and whatever -- whose field it was I didn’t care.</span> <span id="s1585">A few potatoes it wouldn’t -- wouldn’t bother nobody.</span> <span id="s1586">So that’s was the situation during -- during my escape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">Q: Were y-you -- did you feel any hope at that point?</span> <span id="s1588">The war is over and -- and maybe it’s -- maybe there was a feeling that it’s time to start a new life or -- but at the same time, you’ve got this burden of knowing what had happened to your family and to your people.</span> <span id="s1589">What was your -- m -- can you describe your emotions?</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">A: I had -- I-I had -- I was very sad, I didn’t know, I was trying de -- ge -- where, but my -- my first thought was to go to Palestine on that time.</span> <span id="s1591">And then I joined a group, a kibbutz, you know and to go to a kibbutz and to go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1592">But then of course the plans changed.</span> <span id="s1593">My husband was a fighter, I was a fighter and we were plain -- were tired of fighting and I knew I have to start all over again coming to the -- to Palestine on that time.</span> <span id="s1594">They were -- they were fighting for their independent.</span> <span id="s1595">And I said, “I’ll -- I’ll need a rest,” I needed to go to the United States.</span> <span id="s1596">And of course, I’m not regretting, not at all.</span> <span id="s1597">I love this country.</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">Q: How did you -- l-let’s find out -- you -- you’re in Sarnee and you are still with your sister.</span> <span id="s1599">Y -- I think you mentioned in the first interview that you met up with some members of your family who had survived.</span> <span id="s1600">How did you decide what to do next?</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">A: Some members of my fam -- my uncle came in of course, to Sarnee, then my cousin and then we left the Soviet Union and we went -- we left the Soviet actually and anybody who was a citizen of Poland, had the right to leave the Soviet Union -- Russia at that time and to emigrated to Poland.</span> <span id="s1602">My intention was that I’ll go on the western side, on the American side, on the English side and from there I can go better than while being in the Soviet Union because it was a dic -- a dictatorship.</span> <span id="s1603">And I -- Zionism was taboo.</span> <span id="s1604">Zionism was taboo, you could not even mention the word Zionism, because this is nationalism and this is already has a con-connotation with you know, the -- so it was taboo at that time.</span> <span id="s1605">So I wanted to go into the western side and from there I would go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1606">Of course the struggle in Palestine, we know it.</span> <span id="s1607">So we decided -- my aunt send us an affidavit.</span> <span id="s1608">I had an aunt here in Washington, who was my mother’s sister, who left Russia that time.</span> <span id="s1609">We are talking about -- I don’t remember what she said, 1914, 19 -- way, way before the war or before the -- the revolution was.</span> <span id="s1610">She left and she came to the States.</span> <span id="s1611">So I knew we had a -- we had a -- I have an aunt down here, my mother’s sister.</span> <span id="s1612">And the funny part, the way I found her.</span> <span id="s1613">I ask my uncle, because I didn’t know -- I know that someplace I had a aunt, my grandmother -- my Bubba, I used to call her -- used to show pictures and used to kiss -- “These are my grandchildren from the United States,” and all kind of stuff like that.</span> <span id="s1614">So I knew they had -- they had these and these names and they were living someplace in Detroit, so I asked my uncle where did my aunt lived, what city?</span> <span id="s1615">He said, “In Detroit, Michigan.”</span> <span id="s1616">He remembered that.</span> <span id="s1617">So I went -- so how do you find in Detroit, Michigan?</span> <span id="s1618">I didn’t know the language, I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1619">But there was a student, a Jewish student who took English and he was -- and he knew English and I went up to him and I told him my story and I tell, “How do I find my -- my -- my relatives?</span> <span id="s1620">This and that much I know.”</span> <span id="s1621">He said, “Let me try something.”</span> <span id="s1622">And I said, “I’ll pay you for it, if you find them.”</span> <span id="s1623">He sent into the police department in Detroit, Michigan, a letter that said these and these people are looking f -- they are sur -- they survived the war and they are looking for their relatives in the States and within a week or two weeks, I received a -- a response, they are not in Detroit, Michigan, but they are in Washington.</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">Q: Wh -- You sent this letter from -- from where?</span> <span id="s1625">From --</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">A: From Poland, Beetun.</span> <span id="s1627">Beetun --</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">Q: Is this after you had left Sarnee?</span></p> <p><span id="s1629">A: After I have left Sarnee, yeah.</span> <span id="s1630">After I have left Sarnee, I came on the western side and this -- we had there -- this is also another story, the way we had to go through the mountains.</span> <span id="s1631">We had to leave Russia not -- not legally, it was half legal.</span> <span id="s1632">We had to leave through -- cross the borders and come on the western side because they would right away, they would arrest you -- they would whatever.</span> <span id="s1633">But there was already a movement start going because we survivors didn’t wanted to go on the bloody earth any more and we decided to go up to the west.</span> <span id="s1634">To the west I mean England, the States and whatever not.</span> <span id="s1635">So we left, we actually went through the border, the Czechoslovakian -- the Czechoslovakian bor -- the -- the -- on the border police, they were very sympathetic to us.</span> <span id="s1636">They didn’t ask us too many questions either.</span> <span id="s1637">We tell them we are ref -- we are political refugees and that’s it, they knew it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1638">Q: So th-th -- you had to -- the difficult crossing was from Sarnee, the eastern part of Poland to the western part?</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">A: We [indecipherable] yeah.</span> <span id="s1640">But I -- no, we had -- we -- we made our papers -- you know, I -- as a -- as a -- as a Polish citizen up til 1939, had the right to go up to -- to leave the Soviet Union and to go on the western side.</span> <span id="s1641">So I made out my paper with a shalone of the lody -- a lot of people who left Poland, I went on the Polish side, because Poland was -- at that time a half of Poland was -- the Germans divided.</span> <span id="s1642">They gave it back to the Soviets and a piece of Germany, they gave it to the Poles.</span> <span id="s1643">The geography changed at that time.</span> <span id="s1644">You follow me?</span> <span id="s1645">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1646">So the geography changed.</span> <span id="s1647">So my part remained in the Soviet Union, but I had the right to leave the Soviet Union because I was a citizen of Poland, I was a Pole by nationality.</span> <span id="s1648">And to go on the western side.</span> <span id="s1649">So I wind up in Beetun -- in Poland, Beetun and from --</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">Q: How did you get there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1651">A: I -- we went down there, we had -- we went -- we went -- just we settled down there, because I don’t know how did that happen.</span> <span id="s1652">My uncle was down there, he settled down there and I went down there, my cousin and we stayed in Beetun.</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">Q: And your sister too, was she with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">A: And -- and my sister -- my sister happened like this.</span> <span id="s1655">She was in Poland, in an orphanage home, because I couldn’t keep her with me.</span> <span id="s1656">I was myself doing things, I had to make, you know, just to feed myself, I had the -- the -- you know ways to sell, buy, whatever I could just to make some food.</span> <span id="s1657">So my sister, it was no future.</span> <span id="s1658">I had -- my sister had to go to school at that time.</span> <span id="s1659">So I gave her -- she went -- I put her in a orphanage home with a lot the other from different cities.</span> <span id="s1660">And I remember it was in Ludwigsdorf, I think, Ludwigsdorf, on the Polish side.</span> <span id="s1661">It was right on the -- on the border between Poland and Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1662">And she stayed down there and I used to visit her every week.</span> <span id="s1663">And all of a sudden, I come one week, my sister is not there.</span> <span id="s1664">They said it is mun, they don’t have the kibbutz any more and I ask how and w-why and they told me they -- they went over on the other side.</span> <span id="s1665">And I knew exactly what they were talking about.</span> <span id="s1666">They went over the border, they went via -- th-through Czechoslovakia and they went on the American zone.</span> <span id="s1667">So I lost my sister at that time.</span> <span id="s1668">I went to Poland.</span> <span id="s1669">My sister, with the -- with the all group of kids, wind up on the exodus, going to Palestine at that time.</span> <span id="s1670">And then they turned them back, back to Hamburg, they disembarked them, there when I met my sister and I brought her to Italy.</span> <span id="s1671">I came -- I came from Italy to meet her.</span> <span id="s1672">It’s a little complicated, but that’s the way it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">Q: Okay -- okay, so let me make sure I have this straight.</span> <span id="s1674">You were in western Poland, in Beetun -- Beetun?</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1676">Q: And your sister ha -- w-was she with you at that time when you were in Beetun or had she already --</span></p> <p><span id="s1677">A: At Beetun, yeah, she was in a orphanage, but an hour from Beetun by train.</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1679">How --</span></p> <p><span id="s1680">A: An hour, an hour and something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1681">Q: How long did you remain in Beetun?</span></p> <p><span id="s1682">A: Not too long, I don’t know approximate, months, that’s all.</span> <span id="s1683">Til the start of the movement and we wanted to go on the western side, to leave Poland, to get out of there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1684">Q: And you had in mind to get to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1685">A: I had in mind to go to Palestine on that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1686">Q: And did your si -- had your sister want to go there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">A: And my sister, I lost contact with her, because she completely went in another direction, I was asking around, asking here, asking there.</span> <span id="s1688">It was, you know -- it was still all mish -- mish-mash, it was all -- all -- all things.</span> <span id="s1689">And then eventually I find out that she was on the exodus.</span> <span id="s1690">At that time we didn’t know exodus will get so famous.</span> <span id="s1691">On the exodus -- on the exodus boat, the -- the ship, they brought them to Haifa, they brought them to Cyprus and then they brought them to Marseilles.</span> <span id="s1692">They disembarked them in -- near Hamburg, there I decided -- I find out everything in the thier, I decided I’ll make a passport, I’ll go and I’ll get my sister and I’ll bring her to Italy.</span> <span id="s1693">And that’s the way it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">Q: Had you been hearing about the story of the exodus in the news as it was happening that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">A: We knew about it.</span> <span id="s1696">I knew it -- I knew it, I don’t think about the other people, but I knew it because my sister was on it.</span> <span id="s1697">I didn’t know about the other people.</span> <span id="s1698">I guess we -- it was news at that time.</span> <span id="s1699">They were brought into Hamburg and I remember there are frogmen actually went under it and they told the English that we are going to go to pieces to get every the -- with the ship, if you will not.</span> <span id="s1700">And they were afraid at that time for public opinion and they let it go and they made a deal at that time I think, with the Hagannah, I don’t know exactly the deal they made with the Hagannah, so the people, they -- they ask the people to disembark and they put them in a camp in -- near Hamburg.</span> <span id="s1701">Near Hamburg.</span> <span id="s1702">And I went all across Germany, I went to Hamburg, picked up my sister and it was another story by itself, so this will not go in.</span> <span id="s1703">But this is the main thing, I picked up my sister and I brought her to Italy and from Italy she came to the States, we came afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">Q: I want to hear, still in -- about the details of your -- how you -- how you -- what you tra -- how you traveled from -- from Poland and what you did and I know you were in a displaced persons camp in Germany and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1706">Q: And so let’s get that era in between Italy and Poland, after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1707">A: Between Italy, between Poland and Italy --</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">Q: Between Poland and Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1709">A: Poland we left one night, we knew it, we have to leave.</span> <span id="s1710">We’re -- there was the Hagannah that time was working that’s aleah bet, if you know what I’m talking about.</span> <span id="s1711">Aleah bet and all those thing, they were working together with us and we wanted to leave, that’s it -- it’s enough.</span> <span id="s1712">The -- the earth was bloody, it didn’t felt -- there -- no attachment, nothing.</span> <span id="s1713">There’s nothing down there but givas.</span> <span id="s1714">So we decided to leave -- to leave again Poland and to come on the western side.</span> <span id="s1715">And on the western side, it’s where we wind up in Beetun and -- and from Beetun, one day, they decided to close the Czechoslovakian border, was also organized.</span> <span id="s1716">And they let us through, they were very, very friendly and very sympathetic, whatever it was happening, they knew what we suffered and the Czechs were -- a lot of people were very good people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1717">Q: Who were you with at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1718">A: I, my uncle and my cousin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">Q: W-Will you tell us their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">A: That’s Usher.</span> <span id="s1721">Usher was his name and my cousin is Dolph.</span> <span id="s1722">Dolph Burkow.</span> <span id="s1723">Dolph Burkow and Usher Burkow.</span> <span id="s1724">My uncle is Usher Burkow, my cousin is Dolph Burkow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">Q: So they were your -- your mother’s relations?</span></p> <p><span id="s1726">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1727">My mother’s brother’s child, my mother brother, it was.</span> <span id="s1728">Something now, it -- yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1729">Q: So you crossed the Czechoslovakian border with your uncle and your cousin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1730">A: Yes, we were -- went in -- we were assigned first civilian liens in some kind of kind of camp, I don’t even -- bindermisen, binder -- something of this type.</span> <span id="s1731">And then we were assigned to runshaven, branameen.</span> <span id="s1732">And there were the place where Hitler actually was born and there was a kibbutz.</span> <span id="s1733">And in a small town.</span> <span id="s1734">And we wind up down there, being.</span> <span id="s1735">I got married there, I met my husband there.</span> <span id="s1736">And from there we went to Italy via the Alps, we went over to -- on the Italian side.</span> <span id="s1737">We wind up in Milan.</span></p> <p><span id="s1738">Q: Tell me about how you met your husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s1739">A: He was in one -- I came to branameen and down there, there were a lot of boys so they told me they are from Vilnau, so just for curiosity, we -- I went out to meet them and then I met -- I met Leon.</span> <span id="s1740">And I guess maybe our backgrounds maybe was -- you know, he was in the fighting unit, I was -- I don’t know, something -- something got us together and we wanted a family, we wanted, you know and he was ready for it, I was ready and then how we got together and -- and we got married in Austria.</span> <span id="s1741">And my uncle was present, he was -- I have still some pictures, but it was not exactly a wedding, a wedding because all from the camp participated in that wedding.</span> <span id="s1742">So, you know, it was like a family.</span> <span id="s1743">This one baked a cake and this one thing and we’re brought it together like for a poor bride.</span> <span id="s1744">But that’s the way it was at that time and it was fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1745">Q: Was he your first love, your first romance?</span></p> <p><span id="s1746">A: Yeah, I had some romance, but they were not, you know, in the woods there and here, you know, it was, but most yes -- most serious it was, yes, my first one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1747">Q: That must have been -- was that a hopeful time then, did you fe -- did you feel more of a sense of hope for the future after all of the devastation you had experienced?</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">A: All the devastation -- I never gave up hoped, for some reason.</span> <span id="s1749">My positive outlook towards life, it’s funny.</span> <span id="s1750">And I never thought that’s all the people are evil.</span> <span id="s1751">I never lost that torch.</span> <span id="s1752">And I s -- and I saw because the people actually were -- mostly attributed my crave to the Seven Day Adventists in my -- in my -- in my personal experience.</span> <span id="s1753">They endangered for them like a mission impossible, they endanger this -- endanger the life to -- to save our lives.</span> <span id="s1754">And they knew what’s awaiting them, you understand?</span> <span id="s1755">They knew if we were caught in their homes, we will be -- we’ll die together.</span> <span id="s1756">But for them they said maybe ga -- you know, whatever their interpretation was, they were very helpful at that time.</span> <span id="s1757">[inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s1758">Q: You’re talking about the people who helped your family in Poland were Seventh Day Adventists?</span></p> <p><span id="s1759">A: Yeah, Seven Day Adventists, yeah, in Poland where -- yeah, when we escaped from the -- I call it the Dante’s inferno -- from the massacre, from the carnage, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1760">And this should be -- never be forgotten.</span> <span id="s1761">Forgiven, have to, if not you can consume, but never to be forgotten.</span></p> <p><span id="s1762">Q: Were you a -- I mean did -- were you able to even -- you mentioned that you were very angry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1763">A: Very.</span></p> <p><span id="s1764">Q: Were you ab -- able to even imagine forgiving at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">A: Not at that time.</span> <span id="s1766">Little by little, I see that you cannot leave -- that’s -- you have to -- that’s the world we live in.</span> <span id="s1767">But we must learn what the yesterday was.</span> <span id="s1768">Live today and see that tomorrow will be a secure one.</span> <span id="s1769">And that’s what -- it’s a big responsibility the survivors have.</span> <span id="s1770">It’s not to -- to tell everybody a horror story, but to learn what people are capable of doing things and there were people with faces with two eyes in them and they were capable of doing those horrible things.</span> <span id="s1771">And then coming back to their families.</span> <span id="s1772">How could they do this, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1773">And be loving parents, I don’t [inaudible] how.</span> <span id="s1774">Maybe they have their problems.</span></p> <p><span id="s1775">Q: Did you have thoughts of revenge or desire for revenge?</span></p> <p><span id="s1776">A: Very much so.</span> <span id="s1777">Even when I was escaped here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1778">Q: What did you do with those feelings?</span></p> <p><span id="s1779">A: I fought.</span> <span id="s1780">I fought.</span> <span id="s1781">I didn’t want to die.</span> <span id="s1782">This would be a -- not [indecipherable] I want -- didn’t want to die.</span></p> <p><span id="s1783">Q: What about after the war was over?</span> <span id="s1784">I mean, did you still have those feelings of wanting revenge?</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">A: I had for awhile, yes.</span> <span id="s1786">No, I had for awhile, I see revenge, I see -- I started looking at the -- maybe some Germans were -- took part, a lot of them.</span> <span id="s1787">Ordinary people did unordinary things.</span> <span id="s1788">They were ordinary people.</span> <span id="s1789">And I -- I told you, they were drunk, they were -- they smelled with alcohol.</span> <span id="s1790">Because they -- because they could not, even with all the teaching, with all this -- this -- what hate led, the propaganda and all those things, something they could not do it.</span> <span id="s1791">They couldn’t, they had to get drunk and numb to do this horrible thing.</span> <span id="s1792">And this is -- the pain stays with, you know and it’s why again and why again and we must answer it.</span> <span id="s1793">And that’s what -- we go out and do our -- our job.</span> <span id="s1794">And people should learn from our experience.</span> <span id="s1795">Skulls, the titles -- they were people with titles and they are [inaudible] that did horrible things so they -- let’s learn to do the right thing -- if not, I can’t -- like I says, [inaudible] or we live in peace or we’ll all die as fools.</span></p> <p><span id="s1796">Q: Tell me about the life on this kibbutz that you joined in Austria -- it was in Austria, right?</span> <span id="s1797">Or was it in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1798">A: It -- it was -- I was actually private -- my husband was in that kibbutz and was a kibbutz, I was more like private, but I used to meet with them -- with him.</span> <span id="s1799">And in there where we got married.</span> <span id="s1800">But it was actually I was not attached to a kibbutz per se so.</span> <span id="s1801">I just -- just for a little while, when I crossed the border I was with a group and they called the kibbutz, but actually, per se s -- I was not down there constant with them, you understand?</span> <span id="s1802">I was with my uncle, with my cousin.</span> <span id="s1803">And then in Brownamine, I wind up also to be with them together.</span> <span id="s1804">In there when I met Leon, my husband, who was in a kibbutz, down there in Brownamine, in there where we -- we met and we got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s1805">Q: Okay, so you were -- when you were living in Brownamine --</span></p> <p><span id="s1806">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1807">Q: Wh-Where did you live?</span></p> <p><span id="s1808">A: In a house we’re assigned, I don’t know, it must be assigned by the joint distribution committee or by the -- I don’t know how it was, but was assigned.</span> <span id="s1809">You know lot of the survivor used to live -- we lived with another family or two families, it didn’t matter we were a little bit tight, or who cares.</span> <span id="s1810">But we were -- lived together down there and there were officers barracks, I don’t know what was it before or -- or during -- before Hit -- you know, during Hitler’s time, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1811">But this was the place, his workplace in there.</span> <span id="s1812">Used to pass by his house whenever we walked in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1813">Q: But was it a displaced person’s camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1814">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1815">Q: It was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1816">A: It was a displaced person camps and there was some kibbutzim.</span> <span id="s1817">It’s like a transit for people who -- wherever they’ll decide, whenever they’ll decide to go over to Palestine or to United States, it was in meantime you have to be concentrate in a place.</span> <span id="s1818">So this was like a concentrate.</span> <span id="s1819">Some were in kibbutzim and some were -- were on their own, like private.</span> <span id="s1820">Not exact -- well, you know, on their own.</span> <span id="s1821">So I lived with my uncle, with my cousin.</span> <span id="s1822">Not attached to a kibbutz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1823">Q: So, do you remember the moment or the day --</span></p> <p><span id="s1824">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1825">Q: That you met your husband and how that happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1826">A: Yeah, I came out -- yes, I met him and I introduced -- introduced ourselves, I told him that -- and he went to the swimming pool and he asked me also to come.</span> <span id="s1827">I said, “Oh, I will come.”</span> <span id="s1828">I came to the swimming pool and there was no -- nothing to sit on and I said, “No, I ma -- don’t have my -- I don’t have swimming trunk -- I don’t have no -- on the swim -- swimming suit.</span> <span id="s1829">I’m not -- I’m not going to sit here.”</span> <span id="s1830">So while he went for his -- down there to put something to sit down and to -- and to join the -- the crowd down, I had some things to do and I left.</span> <span id="s1831">But then we met again and somehow it started with our courting and then we got married within -- within months.</span> <span id="s1832">I don’t remember how long we went out, about three or four months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1833">Q: Did you tell each other about your experiences during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1834">A: Oh yeah, definitely.</span> <span id="s1835">We knew what was -- our experience was known to each other, definitely.</span> <span id="s1836">He was also in the underground, but his fight was a little different than mine, but we knew definitely what each other had did.</span> <span id="s1837">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1838">Q: So di -- I’m -- I’m just interested in -- in --</span></p> <p><span id="s1839">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1840">Q: Getting a sense of how you -- how you really felt about the -- about your life at that time.</span> <span id="s1841">You -- you meet your husband, you fall in love but is -- was there the -- I mean, w-we associate feelings of lightheartedness with falling in love or w -- or feelings of sort of being dizzy or young, but did you feel like a young woman just falling in love for the first time or did it feel -- were you more -- were you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1842">A: I’m more [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1843">Q: Grieving or was it sad?</span> <span id="s1844">Did you feel -- was it difficult?</span></p> <p><span id="s1845">A: Not sadn -- sadness was with us.</span> <span id="s1846">It was a normal -- a normal every day -- the sadness was there.</span> <span id="s1847">But we were young and I -- I had hopes for the -- for the future, I had hopes.</span> <span id="s1848">If -- otherwise, it would be disastrous.</span> <span id="s1849">I had hopes.</span> <span id="s1850">And I was mostly a positive thinker.</span></p> <p><span id="s1851">Q: What were your hopes and dreams at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1852">A: I want to have a home, a nice family and I had children too.</span> <span id="s1853">I had our little problems here and there, like normal.</span> <span id="s1854">But I had this beautiful family, we have three kids and each -- I’m proud of each one in his own way.</span> <span id="s1855">They understand.</span> <span id="s1856">I respect them, they respect us, so -- it’s looks like -- it’s al-also an achievement, I -- I think so.</span> <span id="s1857">I taught them the right way, what’s right, what’s wrong.</span> <span id="s1858">And I explained to them what hate, they know exactly what hate can do, how dangerous hate can be.</span> <span id="s1859">And this, we must start it when they’re young, to teach them.</span> <span id="s1860">And so they -- so this is -- this is I think it’s my achievement -- it’s our, my husband and I.</span></p> <p><span id="s1861">Q: Did you always make a point of talking to your children about the Holocaust?</span> <span id="s1862">Did you tell them what was -- what your history was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1863">A: I spoke -- it was -- yeah, they know it.</span> <span id="s1864">My son -- let’s see, I spoke once, he didn’t hear exactly, but I spoke and I explained the tales.</span> <span id="s1865">I went through how and our little grandson, who’s 10, he was nine at the time, after I talk -- and I did not even understood if this kid would understand and I didn’t -- I -- you understand, it’s nine years old.</span> <span id="s1866">But after I spoke, he said, “Grandma Boby, c -- would you speak to my school, come to my school and tell your story?”</span> <span id="s1867">I said, “If your teacher will invite me, I’ll come.”</span> <span id="s1868">[inaudible] tell him, you understand?</span> <span id="s1869">So I made something -- in -- impression or something on he may understand.</span> <span id="s1870">He said, “I know you fought the Germans.”</span> <span id="s1871">And this is -- I wanted my kids to know that I was not sitting idly and was waiting to be killed.</span> <span id="s1872">I went out to fight and there were many Jewish boys and girls who did it.</span> <span id="s1873">Actually I was the first one in Washington who spoke about it.</span> <span id="s1874">The first -- the first about the partisans, about the fighters.</span> <span id="s1875">And I know girls who never lived to see the day of liberation.</span> <span id="s1876">They died fighting.</span> <span id="s1877">I was the lucky one to tell my story.</span> <span id="s1878">And there were one on top of the other, I know, but every day was a constant -- a constant moving, a constant going, a constant doing something.</span> <span id="s1879">Or we were ambush them, they ambushed us.</span> <span id="s1880">And it’s a constant or we be there on their back, constant.</span> <span id="s1881">And you were tired.</span> <span id="s1882">You were tired very much.</span> <span id="s1883">I remember almost I -- I paid with my life.</span> <span id="s1884">I came four o’clock, my worst time, my worst time of the day is -- is daybreak, between like four or three o’clock, three o’clock at night til -- til six, three til six.</span> <span id="s1885">We came to a certain destination and -- and I felt -- my commanding officer came up and he said I have to stand on -- on patrol.</span> <span id="s1886">And I begged him -- we were -- we were -- we were traveling on horses, they’re almost old than I. I begged him, I’ll give you two times, I’ll give you four hours later, but let me rest.</span> <span id="s1887">I know my weakness.</span> <span id="s1888">He insisted, I don’t know what was the reason, I had -- I went down there and actually I didn’t fell asleep, but actually I -- I dozed off.</span> <span id="s1889">And there were -- the guy who was -- was checking on the sentries, he grabbed on my -- on my -- on my gun -- he -- he -- he grabbed the gun and you know, he had the right to kill me right there and then because this is -- this is a war, it’s not -- it’s not no -- no nonsense.</span> <span id="s1890">And the next day I was called to the headquarters and I thought that they’re going to put me at firing squad.</span> <span id="s1891">I came -- I -- I was a little bit, you know, inside -- a little bit afraid, I don’t know, you know.</span> <span id="s1892">I said, you know, they’ll put me as a example.</span> <span id="s1893">But somehow they gave me a warning that time.</span> <span id="s1894">And I know I’ll been watched and after a month or so, they already praised me there.</span> <span id="s1895">I done good and they said they -- but this happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1896">Q: So there was a certain amount of -- you also described in the first interview that -- that there were instances of torture, that the partisans occasionally were involved in torturing and that you had said you don’t want to be involved in something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1897">A: Yeah [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s1898">Q: And -- and -- and you just mentioned now that, you know, you weren’t sure that you were completely safe.</span> <span id="s1899">So the partisans were not -- I mean, if we romanticized the situation, we might think -- End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning of Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1900">Q: This is a continuation of an interview with Brenda Senders.</span> <span id="s1901">This is tape three, side B. Okay, so my question is that -- I think the picture that you’re painting of life with this partisan group, is very complex.</span> <span id="s1902">It doesn’t seem that -- that, I mean you -- you couldn’t be sure that if you didn’t -- if you made a mistake you would be beyond being punished and if -- if an enemy were captured, it wasn’t -- it wasn’t just a matter of killing the enemy right away, sometimes those enemies were tortured and you were witnessing human suffering on the other side as well.</span> <span id="s1903">How did that make you feel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1904">A: I -- I didn’t, that’s what I, you know the -- this -- some of the guys, you know, they were -- they were -- they’re very bitter, you know.</span> <span id="s1905">They expressed it more.</span> <span id="s1906">And they -- they got a hold of any of the enemy on the other side and -- he was a big shot.</span> <span id="s1907">He was one of the engineers who build the pantom planes -- the pantom bridges, what they -- you -- during the war the -- the -- the -- the tanks are going over and the -- the tanks.</span> <span id="s1908">You know the -- fast -- you have to come to a -- to a river and you have to build them right there and then.</span> <span id="s1909">And he fell in-into our hands with his chauffeur, with his car, with all those things.</span> <span id="s1910">And decide to have -- I -- I said I’m not for it -- kill him and over with.</span> <span id="s1911">And I remember I saw him face to face.</span> <span id="s1912">He said he had a child.</span> <span id="s1913">I said, “I had a mother an-and a father too.</span> <span id="s1914">And I had a brother and a sister.”</span> <span id="s1915">And I said, “And I had a grandfather and a grandmother.”</span> <span id="s1916">But they -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1917">I said, “It’s not my game, I’m not involved in it.”</span> <span id="s1918">I said, “Kill him and over with.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1919">Q: Were there other instances of torture among the group?</span></p> <p><span id="s1920">A: Not necessary, no.</span> <span id="s1921">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1922">Q: But --</span></p> <p><span id="s1923">A: No, because -- because he was a bigshot, because he was a important man, I don’t know, this is something I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1924">It came to me and I -- I -- I -- I said no.</span> <span id="s1925">I said, “You know, he’s a enemy, we don’t have no place to keep him as a thing, just --.”</span> <span id="s1926">But some guys say I cannot, you understand?</span> <span id="s1927">You can not be responsible, but, you know, that’s the way it happened on that time.</span> <span id="s1928">We didn’t have no prisoners of war, we didn’t have no prison camps, we didn’t have no places to keep him.</span> <span id="s1929">I remember from Moscow, a student, a -- a medical student came to us, they dropped him -- parachuted him into our midst.</span> <span id="s1930">And I don’t know what they told him in Moscow, I don’t know what they told him.</span> <span id="s1931">So when he -- when he came to our midst and he was walking with me -- next to me, he asked, “Where is the second -- where is the next hospital we are taking all our wounded?”</span> <span id="s1932">So we start laughing.</span> <span id="s1933">You understand, it was a joke for us all.</span> <span id="s1934">You know, we are already the veterans, the old people who went on there for -- for a few years, or this.</span> <span id="s1935">A hospital, I said, “You see this b -- horse and buggy?</span> <span id="s1936">This is our hospitals.</span> <span id="s1937">And this is our surgeon and this is assistant, we are doing it right here -- in here, we’re in -- the -- right here, in the open field.”</span> <span id="s1938">And it was cold, we used to make a bonfire if it’s -- we could.</span> <span id="s1939">And a -- many times -- many -- sometimes we were not allowed, because the enemy would sniff us out -- would find us out, where we are.</span> <span id="s1940">And we were a might -- 1500 to 1600 people, full equipped.</span> <span id="s1941">But this big -- a big unit, a lot of thing.</span> <span id="s1942">And I think the partisan fought -- I think very gallantly and I think I’m proud to be a part of this movement at that time, with no reservation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1943">Q: Does it make you angry when you hear people say that the Jews went like lambs to the slaughter?</span></p> <p><span id="s1944">A: Maybe some did.</span> <span id="s1945">Like in any people.</span> <span id="s1946">I would ask them how many countries resisted the Germans.</span> <span id="s1947">The Jews were not ready.</span> <span id="s1948">They were civilians.</span> <span id="s1949">This was a government.</span> <span id="s1950">A government with all the institution, with all the propagandas, with all their might, was -- were planning a execution of a people.</span> <span id="s1951">And they have the surroundings.</span> <span id="s1952">They already prepared the hostile surroundings.</span> <span id="s1953">They made them Fascist, them made them national whatever they call themselves.</span> <span id="s1954">And they helped them out in this -- in this horrible task, to murder and some of them their own citizen, their own friends.</span> <span id="s1955">And then the Germans saw what they are doing, that they use for instance, people from my town -- if he become -- if he became a Fascist, they would take him and take him to another city and from the other city, bring him in my city, there should be no -- no personal connection, you understand?</span> <span id="s1956">There should be no -- no -- that’s how he could do his -- his -- his -- his dirty job, his -- his terrible thing.</span> <span id="s1957">Does it make sense?</span></p> <p><span id="s1958">Q: We were talking a little while ago and I want to get back to where you -- you were -- a-after the war had ended and you were in Germany at this displaced person’s camp, you met your m -- husband, you had gotten married.</span> <span id="s1959">A little before that you had mentioned that you had been trying to get in touch with your aunt in Detroit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1960">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1961">Q: And that was while you were still in Poland.</span> <span id="s1962">What happened?</span> <span id="s1963">Did you get in touch with her by the time you had gotten to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1964">A: Oh yes, I got -- y-y-yes, yes, I got back a response that she moved from Detroit, Michigan, came to Washington with her address.</span> <span id="s1965">And then my uncle, you know, was her brother, start corresponding with her.</span> <span id="s1966">And then we followed.</span> <span id="s1967">We -- she send us affidavit and how -- that how we came, in 1951, in the end of 1951, all -- almost Christmastime, we were on this sh-ship, on the Constitution, coming to the United States.</span> <span id="s1968">On the 100,000 refugees, what Truman at that time, allowed to come to the States, we came on this -- on this quota.</span> <span id="s1969">Plus affidavit my aunt send me and that’s what we wind up to be in Washington.</span></p> <p><span id="s1970">Q: Okay, before you tell about that, tell me about how you -- you made the decision to go from Germany to Italy and when that happened and who was with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1971">A: From Germany to Italy, my -- my husband had some kind assignment to work some -- somethings -- to help out with some kind of -- some kind of job.</span> <span id="s1972">So we decided to go to Italy and that’s what the decision was made there and there and we left -- and this was like a transit, like Austria, Italy and then we’ll go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1973">Then, being in Italy, we changed our mind and we said, “We are tired of fighting, we’ll go to the States and if we don’t like it, then --.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1974">Q: Was your husband working with an organization and was he working with [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1975">A: [indecipherable] the kibbutz, yeah, he was with that organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s1976">Q: So that was who sent him to -- on assignment to Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1977">A: To Italy he had to go, yeah.</span> <span id="s1978">To Italy and anyway it was our way of going there anyway and he was send there, so it -- both things match together and we were -- and we -- and we came down there.</span> <span id="s1979">You know also, the day when we got married, yes, I forgot to mention, he got a telegram that his sister survived from a concentration camp and she lives in Italy.</span> <span id="s1980">So all together, like camil -- like kenna -- like all together.</span> <span id="s1981">And right after we got married, we went to Italy, we met his sister and from there of course -- then afterwards we came to the States.</span> <span id="s1982">And some people went to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1983">Legally, illegally, illegal, whatever it was at that time.</span> <span id="s1984">If you know from exodus, you know it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1985">Q: What w -- y -- what was the name of the organization that your husband was working for?</span></p> <p><span id="s1986">A: It was a beetar organization, they call it, yeah.</span> <span id="s1987">The beetar.</span></p> <p><span id="s1988">Q: So it -- you arrived in Italy in 1946?</span></p> <p><span id="s1989">A: 1946 we got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s1990">Q: In Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1991">A: Yeah, in 1946, yeah, we a -- we arrived in Italy and actually yeah, that’s correct, 1946.</span> <span id="s1992">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1993">Q: But first tell me about your -- your wedding.</span></p> <p><span id="s1994">A: Oh, it was a -- a wedding, you know, it’s like the whole camp participated and it was like a -- a big -- a big excitement for everybody here, we got married.</span> <span id="s1995">First of all I didn’t want it, I said, “Let’s go, we’ll go to Italy and down there we’ll see what’s what,” but my uncle insisted -- my uncle insisted, said, “You don’t have nobody, he doesn’t have nobody, why -- make it legal.”</span> <span id="s1996">And I said, “Okay, let’s make it legal.”</span> <span id="s1997">You know, I was reluctant, yes, marriage, you know, we go over the borders and all those thing.</span> <span id="s1998">So we decided to get married and it was a big excitement, we were the only one, bride and groom, to get married and this and that.</span> <span id="s1999">So it was the excitement of the whole -- of the whole camp.</span> <span id="s2000">Like they -- they -- one woman baked a cake, the other one it was -- they brought a dean in the kibbutz.</span> <span id="s2001">In the kibbutz was the -- the -- the wedding.</span> <span id="s2002">We had the -- we had attendant -- attendant with two rabbis.</span> <span id="s2003">Rabbis were attending our wedding.</span> <span id="s2004">So it was -- it was interesting.</span> <span id="s2005">I -- I felt a little bit jitter I remember, it was so funny, it’s like a commitment, it’s like something, you know.</span> <span id="s2006">But y-you know, it was -- it was okay, it was a lot of excitement at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2007">Q: Who married you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2008">A: The -- the rabbi, you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s2009">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2010">A: There -- there were two rabbis, I think.</span> <span id="s2011">One was a Hungarian and both -- one from Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s2012">How did they survived, I don’t know up til now.</span> <span id="s2013">I don’t remember their story.</span> <span id="s2014">But they were also -- they were something -- they were in the camp.</span> <span id="s2015">One is a Hungarian I think and one Czechoslovakian or so.</span> <span id="s2016">So we had two rabbis to our wedding.</span> <span id="s2017">I have some pictures someplace, I -- I did not refer them -- I don’t -- not thinking about it.</span> <span id="s2018">They are in black and white.</span> <span id="s2019">Yes, I think this should be sufficient, whatever -- how they’re interested.</span></p> <p><span id="s2020">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2021">I’m th -- also curious about --</span></p> <p><span id="s2022">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2023">Q: That your displaced person’s camp --</span></p> <p><span id="s2024">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2025">Q: And -- was it -- was it well organized, did you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s2026">A: It was organized, I don’t know well.</span> <span id="s2027">Of course, for improvement it’s always.</span> <span id="s2028">But it’s was organized and each -- let’s say there were a few kibbutzim, a few groups, what they -- each one cared for them, you know, there were separate entities, like.</span> <span id="s2029">And I would say they were well organized and we u -- we used to get some kind of provision, I don’t know how, from the highers, from the joint distribution committee.</span> <span id="s2030">I don’t know exactly.</span> <span id="s2031">But we used to get some provisions somep -- some -- some breve -- some ri -- assigned to us.</span> <span id="s2032">I don’t remember exactly.</span> <span id="s2033">My uncle, I think used to get it.</span> <span id="s2034">We used to be all involved.</span></p> <p><span id="s2035">Q: And you were -- you were free to come and go as you pleased?</span> <span id="s2036">Was there -- were there any restrictions?</span></p> <p><span id="s2037">A: Not exactly, not -- not exactly free and go, we had to have a little thing to go out from the camp to stroll around.</span> <span id="s2038">For instance, once I was arrested by the MP.</span> <span id="s2039">I was going out.</span> <span id="s2040">Maybe they liked the MP’s, I don’t know, we were young girls and they were young boys.</span> <span id="s2041">You know, it’s something that they do -- they stopped us and you know, what -- they let us, you know.</span> <span id="s2042">But it was funny, because we were not allowed perfaca to go down there, we had to have a permission or something.</span> <span id="s2043">But we used to go out.</span> <span id="s2044">It was not so bad.</span> <span id="s2045">We used to go out and we used to s -- to -- to, but one occasion it was that way.</span> <span id="s2046">We were arrested by the MP, but this is -- was -- maybe, I don’t know, we were young girls and they were young boys, so, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2047">Q: It was because you’d gone out without a pass, is that why?</span></p> <p><span id="s2048">A: I think without a pass, or something.</span> <span id="s2049">They were asking us for a pass and I said and we don’t have it and all kind of things.</span> <span id="s2050">So that’s, I --</span></p> <p><span id="s2051">Q: What did they do to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2052">A: No, nothing.</span> <span id="s2053">They said they’ll arrest us and -- but it’s -- nothing happened.</span> <span id="s2054">No, it was a little bit of excitement in the -- in the town down there and I think we needed some kind of -- if we go to the city, I -- but I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s2055">But people used to move around, we used to go, we used to even go up to Lind’s, we used to go there and here with thems -- we’re some -- I don’t remember this is exactly, the restrictions had a ba -- but we used to move, we used to go up to Lind’s and there and here and somehow we used to find our way, how to go about.</span> <span id="s2056">And so this --</span></p> <p><span id="s2057">Q: Do you remember dealing with a civilian, Austrian population, non-Jews after -- after the war while you were there and were there any incidents?</span></p> <p><span id="s2058">A: Yeah, because they’re all, you know the tone was already different, you know.</span> <span id="s2059">He said -- they were ti -- for instance, the town where he was born, they said he was a nasty and he was a bad guy when he was young, but you know during his last time, maybe they talked, they -- they spoke differently about him, you understand?</span> <span id="s2060">But in our time he came down there, listen the shoemaker, this one, I used to take my shoes, he used to say he was nasty, he was -- he was beating up everybody and this and that.</span> <span id="s2061">But we had connection, yes, definitely, with the Austrian.</span> <span id="s2062">Not go bosom buddies, you know, we were separate from them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2063">Q: Did you feel resentment in any way towards the Austrians?</span></p> <p><span id="s2064">A: I felt a resentment to all those things when it happened, but not in a personal, you know, when you meet a person, the person, then they meet you.</span> <span id="s2065">Of course when you find out he was a Nazi or involved with the thing, you right away felt a revolt too much then.</span> <span id="s2066">Felt a resentment, felt a fimkanee -- finekinay you understand?</span> <span id="s2067">Because I knew what they -- what they were all -- what they were all about, what their aim was.</span></p> <p><span id="s2068">Q: So you did meet -- you actually met people who had been Nazis?</span></p> <p><span id="s2069">A: Not -- they would not tell me.</span> <span id="s2070">If they were, they would not tell me.</span> <span id="s2071">Sometimes they would say a word here and there, I used to make a puzzle and find out that’s they were involved somewhat with the Nazis.</span> <span id="s2072">I already had my way.</span> <span id="s2073">I knew that they were something involved with them.</span> <span id="s2074">They were -- later on they knew it was not a big honor, to be from the Hitler youth, or from the Nazi movement.</span> <span id="s2075">And I don’t know how many Germans -- a lot of Germans knew what was going on.</span> <span id="s2076">But the propaganda was so harsh and they -- about the Jews, they portrayed the Jews with the -- with the -- with the noses, with the things.</span> <span id="s2077">Hitler himself, if he take off his hair, he looked more like a caricature he would make of the Jews, he would be one.</span> <span id="s2078">But that’s -- that’s another thing.</span> <span id="s2079">But put him in -- in the uniform of our concentration camp, let’s see how he’d lever look.</span> <span id="s2080">And if he would be alive out there, they put him -- well they put him in -- in a cage.</span> <span id="s2081">To look at the specimen.</span></p> <p><span id="s2082">Q: Tell me about your time in Italy and what you -- you -- you spent f -- about five years there?</span></p> <p><span id="s2083">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2084">Q: Ta -- Tell me about what you were doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2085">A: I love the Italian people.</span> <span id="s2086">In the beginning I felt a funny feeling about Fascism and Mussolini, but after I -- I find out he was also -- he was also like a victim, he went with Hi-Hitler and then he was in his game already.</span> <span id="s2087">He -- with all this -- like he blackmailed him intel -- in a lot of things, because Mussolini was in the begin -- after we met the Italian people, I -- I didn’t feel bad about it, because we knew that they tricked him in, also -- in a lot of ca -- of cases and a lot of ways.</span> <span id="s2088">And with this patachi, whatever he was involved in, it’s, you know -- all sorts -- it’s a work of the -- I think of the Nazis, of the Germans, they pushed on him.</span> <span id="s2089">And so I didn’t felt resentment.</span> <span id="s2090">I liked my -- my neighbors.</span> <span id="s2091">I became even very friendly with them.</span> <span id="s2092">Our daughter was born -- re-really was born in Italy, she had friend, a friend next door, used to go out.</span> <span id="s2093">They were very nice and very interesting people.</span> <span id="s2094">Most of them liked opera, like singing, you know, they used to sing arias in the -- a bu -- a guy on a bicycle used to go -- ride on the bicycle and sing arias from the opera.</span> <span id="s2095">And it was -- it was a nice -- a nice time spend in Italy.</span> <span id="s2096">I have good memories, very good memories.</span></p> <p><span id="s2097">Q: Wh-Where were you living?</span></p> <p><span id="s2098">A: In Milano, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2099">And there were some -- a concentration of Jewish people down there and til the time came we get our visa and in 19 -- in the end, almost -- almost our visa went out on the international border.</span> <span id="s2100">So we were coming to the States, you understand, just almost like to the day we were living Italy and coming -- and coming to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s2101">Q: And she’s -- did you speak English at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s2102">A: Not at all.</span> <span id="s2103">And I -- it was so difficult for me, I remember Christmas, I could not even pronounce it.</span> <span id="s2104">It was Christmastime and -- and my Rita spoke Italian very well and she met another Italian lit-little kid and they used to play together.</span> <span id="s2105">And what worried me very much, I remember being on the Constitution, they told me in Italy that everything is -- is conser -- conserved, everything is conserved there in the United -- everything comes in boxes and in -- in package.</span> <span id="s2106">And I liked fresh foods.</span> <span id="s2107">And -- and I said, God, she sa -- even chicken, you -- you get it in a -- you know, it’s so all -- all -- all creative things for some people.</span> <span id="s2108">And this -- I met this Italian woman and start talking to her, she said, “I knew -- I live in the United States.</span> <span id="s2109">You can get as much fresh food as you want to.</span> <span id="s2110">Just if you wanted to do this, it’s fine.</span> <span id="s2111">Of course we have -- we have -- we have --.”</span> <span id="s2112">I was so happy, I remember.</span> <span id="s2113">I just came running and I said, “Oh my God, look at that.”</span> <span id="s2114">It was a false -- a false information before.</span> <span id="s2115">And so we came and I got very sick on the -- coming in here on the -- on the ship.</span> <span id="s2116">I got seasick and I thought maybe I will never see the Statue of Liberty.</span></p> <p><span id="s2117">Q: Did you study English at all while you were in Italy or did you come to the United States without learning any?</span></p> <p><span id="s2118">A: We didn’t - I wanted to go to berlitz, they have berlitz schools down there, where they teach English.</span> <span id="s2119">And I started maybe one or two lessons and then, you know, you ge -- you get busy, whatever you are doing, with the kid I already had and whatever you are doing and I said, “When I’ll come to the States, I’ll do it.”</span> <span id="s2120">And so we didn’t.</span> <span id="s2121">We did very limited -- we didn’t know English at all.</span> <span id="s2122">But little by little, somehow I can converse and I -- and I’m fine.</span> <span id="s2123">I read a li -- goo -- I read and I -- I-I’m fine.</span> <span id="s2124">I think so, at least.</span></p> <p><span id="s2125">Q: Oh very, you’re very fine.</span> <span id="s2126">And -- okay, so you’re -- you’re on the -- the ship, coming to the United States.</span> <span id="s2127">You get --</span></p> <p><span id="s2128">A: I wanted here in to go to school and yet I proceeded to go into college.</span> <span id="s2129">That’s, you know, maybe I was not too ambitious about it, otherwise I would have done it.</span> <span id="s2130">But I had the -- I was trying [indecipherable] there, because I was a teacher, I taught in the camps.</span> <span id="s2131">When I was in the camps, I taught first graders and things and I loved children and children loved me very much, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s2132">Q: Which camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s2133">A: In -- in Italy, we were in a camp, Hadriatica, they call it.</span> <span id="s2134">That’s in the outskirts of Milan.</span></p> <p><span id="s2135">Q: A displaced persons --</span></p> <p><span id="s2136">A: That was a camp for -- displaced person camp, yeah.</span> <span id="s2137">Oh, you forgot to mention this here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2138">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2139">H -- Is that where you lived th-the entire time that you were in Italy?</span></p> <p><span id="s2140">A: Not the entire.</span> <span id="s2141">For a-awhile and then we went privately -- to live privately and from our private home, we came to the States.</span> <span id="s2142">We left the camp.</span> <span id="s2143">They disbanded the camp or they moved the camp, I don’t know exactly, but they disbanded the camp and a lot of people left for Palestine, a lot of people left there, here and -- and -- and we went private and being private, we went -- we came to the States.</span> <span id="s2144">But we were in that camp with a lot of more refugees like ourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s2145">Q: So you’re on the ship and you -- were you ill the entire trip?</span></p> <p><span id="s2146">A: I was ill the entire trip.</span> <span id="s2147">No, the -- not the entire -- up til we came to the Gabriel tart.</span> <span id="s2148">The Gabriel tart are the deep waters already, Africa and there -- down there in the -- on the horn.</span> <span id="s2149">When we came down there, right away I got like somebody would -- there I got right away sick.</span> <span id="s2150">I couldn’t -- I couldn’t even go near the -- the -- the dining room, that’s how darn sick I was.</span> <span id="s2151">And I thought, “God almighty, I will never see here, I went through all these things, the war and everything, I’ll never see.”</span> <span id="s2152">I was so sick to my stomach.</span> <span id="s2153">When they told me the Statue of Liberty, I came out -- crawl out from down there, from the -- my cabin and I looked and it was a sight to see, I remember.</span> <span id="s2154">I remember it in the early morning, the Statue of Liberty, with the thing and it was -- it was very fine.</span> <span id="s2155">Then we came to the harbor of New York.</span> <span id="s2156">There was a cousin of ours, were waiting for us.</span> <span id="s2157">I expected my aunt to come from Washington, she didn’t, but she gave some words to my -- our cousin in New York and she sent her son and he -- and he was waiting for us -- for our arrival.</span> <span id="s2158">Then we -- when we came, he greeted us, so it was -- it was a little bit -- it w -- you know, very -- it was pleasant for us.</span> <span id="s2159">And -- and I remember on a Sunday we arrived on the harbor and -- and New York.</span> <span id="s2160">And then another one, she was a distant relative of some kind and she was married and she came also to greet us.</span> <span id="s2161">And something I didn’t had a good feeling about her, I don’t know exactly, but something about.</span> <span id="s2162">Whatever -- she was standing, I don’t know, something I didn’t had a good feeling about her.</span> <span id="s2163">And maybe I thought she did the -- looked down, I don’t know, something -- I didn’t had a good feeling about her.</span> <span id="s2164">And then he took us to his house, this Dave, who came to -- to greet us on the thing.</span> <span id="s2165">And when we came out from that -- from the harbor, I didn’t like it.</span> <span id="s2166">I said, “This is America?</span> <span id="s2167">This is the United States?”</span> <span id="s2168">Everything -- you know Sunday, it was deserted and those big factories down there, right down there in the -- it was something -- I did not, it made a funny impression on me.</span> <span id="s2169">Something -- I expected in my head the United States to be something, something.</span> <span id="s2170">And here I see this empty and the big, big, huge, huge buildings.</span> <span id="s2171">And then he took us to his house and when I walked in, it was like in the movies I see.</span> <span id="s2172">It was a s -- a small, little apart -- a nice apartment.</span> <span id="s2173">It was a two story, with -- with the steps going up and it was -- and I said to Leon, “Lookit, it’s like in the movies we saw, American movies, it’s like in the movies.”</span> <span id="s2174">And there was a television and -- and I remember and also this has struck me very funny at that time.</span> <span id="s2175">It was a Milton Berle show at that time, very, very, very, very popular, everybody was watching, it was such an excitement like who knows what was going on.</span> <span id="s2176">And I came the first night -- instead of talking to us, she left us and she went to watch Milton Berle and -- and I felt so funny about it, because I said, “It wouldn’t happen this -- in Europe, I wouldn’t do it.”</span> <span id="s2177">But this is, you know, maybe it was no harm was done.</span> <span id="s2178">You understand, but I was so touched by every little thing that I -- I -- I -- I just felt it’s, you know, it was not right.</span> <span id="s2179">But this was the first impression about the United States.</span> <span id="s2180">And they had their daughter -- and then I walked in and a -- and upstairs they had her bedroom and she had so many shoes and I ask her, “Why do you have so many shoes?”</span> <span id="s2181">It was everything something new for me, something different, than I’m used to down there.</span> <span id="s2182">But anyway it was -- it was okay.</span> <span id="s2183">I was a little bit angry at my aunt, she didn’t come, but she was not a rich woman herself, she was a hard working woman.</span> <span id="s2184">So then -- and then when we came to the -- to Washington, I could understand.</span> <span id="s2185">She couldn’t leave at that time her husband or whatever.</span> <span id="s2186">So we stayed.</span> <span id="s2187">I had a little bit also f-feelings about my cousins because maybe I expected from them more than they could give me.</span> <span id="s2188">You know, I was -- I was wounded, like a wounded animal and here -- you understand, a little compassion, a little understanding, a little asking about their family.</span> <span id="s2189">It’s not you and us.</span> <span id="s2190">It’s not, yet -- it’s the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s2191">Q: You felt like they were trying to create a -- a division between --</span></p> <p><span id="s2192">A: It’s something like a division, like -- ignorant about that what was going on down there.</span> <span id="s2193">It’s like they talk about -- they talked about Europe, let’s say, there would be like it’s another planet.</span> <span id="s2194">And this is something that struck me very un-understanding.</span> <span id="s2195">They never -- they never asked me, you’re some -- you know this is a little bit -- was, you know.</span> <span id="s2196">But then their children were more -- were more sub-subseptive, more -- more understanding, more think towards -- they used to ask me some question and some of them were vrot some and they ask me some question about what happening in Europe.</span> <span id="s2197">They were already start to being more aware of that.</span> <span id="s2198">But their parents, no.</span> <span id="s2199">Once in awhile we used to be invited, but not -- but not close- close like.</span> <span id="s2200">But that’s the way it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s2201">Q: So they didn’t ask you about what had happened to you during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s2202">A: Very little.</span> <span id="s2203">And I didn’t volunteer to -- to -- to -- to push on them.</span> <span id="s2204">The int -- didn’t volunteer and they didn’t ask so I didn’t tell them, you understand?</span></p> <p><span id="s2205">Q: Was that difficult?</span></p> <p><span id="s2206">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2207">Q: Not to talk to -- to people who were your family and -- about -- about this immense tragedy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2208">A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2209">And I thought I singled them out, I thought maybe they are not aware, because I’m -- okay, whatever -- I ne -- wanted to say.</span> <span id="s2210">But that was hurting very much.</span> <span id="s2211">Our children should have been more together with them.</span> <span id="s2212">We used to get together, but not at real family, you know, because they were my immediate family, that’s all that I had.</span> <span id="s2213">And so this is -- this is the way the [indecipherable] remain on our own.</span> <span id="s2214">We stood on our own two feet, we made it.</span> <span id="s2215">And made it pretty okay, made a nice living.</span> <span id="s2216">We raised our kids, like I said, we are very proud of each one of them.</span> <span id="s2217">One is in advertising, one is a free lance writer in Los Angeles and we have a son who is doing very well, he is a nice human being, that’s the -- very important.</span> <span id="s2218">Very sensitive and sensible person.</span> <span id="s2219">And this is two important things in life.</span></p> <p><span id="s2220">Q: Tell me the names of your children and when they were born.</span></p> <p><span id="s2221">A: Rita.</span> <span id="s2222">Rita was born in ‘49.</span></p> <p><span id="s2223">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2224">A: Yes, Rita, my -- our oldest daughter was born in 1949, October the second.</span> <span id="s2225">Sherry was born June 12th, 1954 and Stanley was born August 29th, 1956.</span></p> <p><span id="s2226">Q: And what are the -- why don’t you go ahead and tell me the names of your -- of all your grandchildren?</span></p> <p><span id="s2227">A: I have Rochelle.</span> <span id="s2228">Rochelle Leah.</span> <span id="s2229">I have La-Laura Michelle, that’s Sherry’s daughter.</span> <span id="s2230">Then I have Justin, who is our son’s son and then I have two kids from my -- from our older daughter, two grandchildren, Nick and Lucy Kate.</span> <span id="s2231">They were adopted and they’re adorable kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s2232">Q: All right, great.</span> <span id="s2233">Okay.</span> <span id="s2234">So you -- you -- did you come to Washington right away after arriving in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s2235">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2236">After arriving in New York, we were down there for a week, rested up a little bit because I was very weak coming down from the ship and I was -- I was still going around like being dizzy after I already came on the ground.</span> <span id="s2237">So I was dizzy and I was -- I was weak.</span> <span id="s2238">I didn’t eat nothing.</span> <span id="s2239">I had to come back to myself.</span> <span id="s2240">And so for a -- a -- something like a week, we stayed in New York with our relatives and -- and from New York, we came to Washington.</span> <span id="s2241">And on the station -- on -- we came by train at that time I remember.</span> <span id="s2242">On the station we were greeted by my aunt, uncle and a cousin, a survivor, I remember, who came before I had afass, and my cousin who -- her grandparents I described down there when I left them, right, in Sarnee, before I escaped from the -- from the execution, the Pomerantz family.</span></p> <p><span id="s2243">Q: What did you do, how did you start out?</span></p> <p><span id="s2244">A: My aunt -- yeah, this was -- I had -- my aunt prepared for us an apartment.</span> <span id="s2245">And -- so this was, but my husband didn’t have a job yet, so he went around til he find himself a job.</span> <span id="s2246">We brought a little bit money with us.</span> <span id="s2247">We were doing a little business in Italy, so we were not completely, you know, penniless.</span> <span id="s2248">So we brought a little bit money with us and -- and then he start looking for a job, he find a -- a job in the United Typewriter Company, was at that time.</span> <span id="s2249">And he was working down there for a few years, til he went in business for himself.</span> <span id="s2250">And I -- I was home taking care of the kids, they were little.</span> <span id="s2251">I wanted to go also in the teaching, to be like a Sunday and I had to leave the kids on Sundays and I decided against it, I said, “It’s more important for me to be with the children than to leave them on Sundays, unsupervised.”</span> <span id="s2252">And maybe I did a good choice, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2253">Q: Were you learning English?</span></p> <p><span id="s2254">A: Yeah, Hebrew.</span> <span id="s2255">I wanted to go in Hebrew and then I -- i-it was not a lot of English to know that, you know, in the school, in the Hebrew school, cause I want to teach in Hebrew.</span> <span id="s2256">Was Hebrew and some other and that was a parochial Hebrew school in Washington.</span> <span id="s2257">I had to go trum a little with a few courses, because I was already aware of being -- in the camp, I was teaching first graders and kindergarten.</span> <span id="s2258">So I -- I had to go through a course and then I didn’t -- I decided against it.</span> <span id="s2259">I said it was more important for the kids -- sometimes we used to go out skating o-or skiing even, we went away for the weekends.</span> <span id="s2260">And we were together with the family, so I think this was -- it was not a bad choice at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2261">Q: What a -- what about your other experiences in adjusting to this new society?</span> <span id="s2262">Was there anything notable about it, that -- that stood out as being very different from where you -- wh-what you had come from or what you ex -- anything different than what you expected?</span></p> <p><span id="s2263">A: It was different.</span> <span id="s2264">Some people were preoccupied with things that did not -- there a lot of emphasis money, money, money -- and something that sometimes used to rub me the wrong way.</span> <span id="s2265">But you know, and I thought maybe because we didn’t feel strongly, that I could not figure out what it is sometimes used to rub me [inaudible] the wrong way.</span> <span id="s2266">And -- but little by little we adjusted.</span> <span id="s2267">We were different, I would say.</span> <span id="s2268">You know, but I did not blame, because I went through my journey, life was a completely different one from the people who were born in here, that didn’t experience no hardship, nothing.</span> <span id="s2269">They were spoiled in my estimation, in my eyes.</span> <span id="s2270">Sometimes I used to call them the spoiled America.</span> <span id="s2271">But maybe if everything would be in target down there in my family and my things, I don’t know how would it be.</span></p> <p><span id="s2272">Q: Did you form fre -- did you form friendships with Americans?</span></p> <p><span id="s2273">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2274">I formed friendship with Americans, but mostly we were involved with the survivors.</span> <span id="s2275">But af -- we did, we had very good fre -- End of Tape Three, Side B Beginning of Tape Four, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s2276">Q: This is a continuation of an interview with Brenda Senders.</span> <span id="s2277">This is tape four, side A. Okay, your friendships -- your friendships with -- some of them were with survivors and some with non-survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s2278">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2279">Q: Did you feel a gap, in a way, that you were -- when you were with survivors, you were with people of your own kind and when you weren’t, you were with a different kind of person?</span> <span id="s2280">Was there that kind of division?</span></p> <p><span id="s2281">A: Something, maybe if I would find the chemistry would work, maybe it would be okay, on the -- not -- but with some I felt closer, with Americans, but more closer with -- I -- I used to feel with -- with survivors, because our journey in life is almost, you know -- each one is different, but similar I think.</span> <span id="s2282">Whatever we went through, we could converse, you could understand more each other.</span> <span id="s2283">But we had a lot of friends that were not survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s2284">Q: Did you feel that they could re -- that those friends who were non-survivors could really understand what you had been through?</span></p> <p><span id="s2285">A: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s2286">I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s2287">And I s -- and I always said I am not -- I don’t want you to feel sorry for me, that’s -- it’s not because, you know, some understanding, not exactly to feel, you know, they see the war, that’s [inaudible] to me.</span> <span id="s2288">But it was behind their understanding.</span> <span id="s2289">The first time, when I came out to speak to those people about my partisan activities, about being -- I’m telling you, I made a impression on people.</span> <span id="s2290">They went through that time, difficult, difficult, difficult times.</span> <span id="s2291">One became a lawyer and the other one I met, about si -- about eight or nine years later, in Washington.</span> <span id="s2292">And she looked very much, you know, very blonde and very, you know, she looks like a Swedish girl.</span> <span id="s2293">And there she tells a story, she was -- she heard all kinds of stories about the Jews and here she heard me telling all these thing -- all these things.</span> <span id="s2294">And I met her and I said, “Are you’re Gilbert?</span> <span id="s2295">Are you’re not the girl who was at the first meeting when I spoke?”</span> <span id="s2296">And I told her where and on Willard Avenue, down there on the UJA?</span> <span id="s2297">“Oh,” she said, “yes, are you Brenda?”</span> <span id="s2298">Och, she started telling all her friends, you know, because I recognized her, her face was so -- so -- they -- told her friends, what -- and then -- then I said -- I invited her to our business and she said to my son, “You don’t know what impression your mother made on me.</span> <span id="s2299">She made me -- she made me do things.</span> <span id="s2300">I forced myself.”</span> <span id="s2301">So my son made, again a remark, he said, “She made a impression on me, too,” you know, my son.</span> <span id="s2302">And so it’s -- it’s did something, you know, it’s -- I think my story, it made a difference, I don’t know what words I can choose for.</span></p> <p><span id="s2303">Q: When did you start speaking about your experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s2304">A: It was in the late 60’s, I don’t remember exactly, but something in the late 60’s, 70, before -- they start already talking about the museum and then -- and then I came and one girl who was a friend of mine, I start telling her, said, “Brenda, toil, tell them the story.”</span> <span id="s2305">I said, “If you hold my hands, I’ll tell the story.”</span> <span id="s2306">And I came about and I start telling them and I start telling them, little by little, I was nervous like a kid.</span> <span id="s2307">And -- and -- and they accepted it very nicely.</span> <span id="s2308">And after I explained to them, who were the partisans, where the partisans, how did I wind up down there and what our journey was, what we did.</span> <span id="s2309">And it was a eye opener for them all.</span></p> <p><span id="s2310">Q: Who was this group that -- who was this first group that you were speaking to?</span></p> <p><span id="s2311">A: It was a UJA group.</span> <span id="s2312">But I think it was still -- there were some professional people, I don’t know exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s2313">Q: UJ --</span></p> <p><span id="s2314">A: We were adults.</span></p> <p><span id="s2315">Q: United Jewish Appeal?</span></p> <p><span id="s2316">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2317">We were adults and it was a full, full, big room, we were three girls with -- my story somehow, at that time, was okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2318">Q: How did the -- how did the UJA get in touch with you to do this or did you get in touch with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2319">A: We were in a group, a survivors group and in the survivors group, they knew that I’m one of the survivors and I was very much involved, yeah, in Washington with bonds in the organization Nahamat, that used to call Golda Meir, you know, the pioneer of women -- it’s a Golda Meir club that’s -- and now they call it Nahamat.</span> <span id="s2320">So I was down there as a member.</span> <span id="s2321">And then I belonged to the -- to the survivors group.</span> <span id="s2322">In the UJA, some time they wanted to know more about the survivors and I was the one of us invited.</span> <span id="s2323">And I came -- I was working down there in business a little bit -- I came and I told them a little bit about my story, they said they wanted to hear more.</span> <span id="s2324">So I came in a -- a evening, we were three -- thr -- two of us -- three of us, so each one was telling a story.</span> <span id="s2325">I was different because I wasn’t down there, I went on to the partisans.</span> <span id="s2326">But I was one of the first one, actually, who came out to speak about it.</span> <span id="s2327">And this is a fact.</span></p> <p><span id="s2328">Q: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s2329">A: For the opening of the museum</span></p> <p><span id="s2330">Q: Did it seem to you at the time that these people you were speaking to really didn’t know about what you were telling them?</span> <span id="s2331">Was it new to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2332">A: I used to ask him, after a -- I went through a little bit, “Do you follow my thoughts?</span> <span id="s2333">Do you -- if not, please ask me later on, questions.”</span> <span id="s2334">Because I went through a little bit and you know, it’s my story, but it’s -- if they will comprehend this.</span> <span id="s2335">They said, “Yes, yes,” and then, afterwards, they ask me some questions.</span> <span id="s2336">But I think they did res -- was receptive to my story.</span> <span id="s2337">I think -- I think so.</span> <span id="s2338">And this was my first and then I used to go out to schools and then I worked with the children -- to schools a lody and speak to the students.</span> <span id="s2339">And then I walked in the children’s museum, if you remember -- ‘Remember the Children’, before opening of the museum in Washington, I used to go down there sometimes three or four times a week.</span> <span id="s2340">It was in northeast, down there on Eighth Street or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s2341">Q: L -- L Street, I -- probably?</span></p> <p><span id="s2342">A: A -- lin -- there is a children’s museum down there with all international -- there is mec -- there is all kind of -- you know, on top used to be ‘Remember the Children’.</span> <span id="s2343">It was Mrs. Yates, it was the congresswoman was instrumental of -- of telling the story about the children, she shed -- s-she owns and it was a very -- a very wise choice at that time.</span> <span id="s2344">I used to go down there as a survivor to tell my story to the children.</span> <span id="s2345">They were not allow children below six.</span> <span id="s2346">And they had to be accompanied by their parents.</span> <span id="s2347">Because it was, you know, it was a sad story.</span> <span id="s2348">And -- and then, after w-we were finished, that was -- the entrance was a movie, then it was a whole wall of children, pre-war children, Jewish kids.</span> <span id="s2349">Then it was a house in Germany, a Jewish family, the aroma even of the food you can smell and the singing of the classical music.</span> <span id="s2350">A -- a regular house, a middle -- middle class, or maybe -- I don’t know what kind of, but they’re Jewish, nice home and then it used to be the resistant and then the family Voss, who saved a lot the Jewish children in Holland, I think, Mrs. Voss comes.</span> <span id="s2351">I -- I think she comes from Holland.</span> <span id="s2352">She made a tunnel and I think they saved some -- I -- I met her.</span> <span id="s2353">She came -- she be -- was honored in Washington.</span> <span id="s2354">Her husband and her.</span> <span id="s2355">So there were the Voss family, the story about them and then used to be a la -- a little like library with the Anne Frank’s books, with all the books and these and the kids used to go all this way and there was a book with they write their names and after they listen to whatever the eyewitness was.</span> <span id="s2356">They used to come back and write their impression or their feelings or whatever they wanted.</span> <span id="s2357">And I had a lot of nice -- nice little notes for me, you know.</span> <span id="s2358">It’s still someplace in the museum, must be.</span> <span id="s2359">And -- and I used to explain to them and after we used to give them tiles.</span> <span id="s2360">And on the tiles we used to ask them after I told them my little story, you know, in the children’s version, I could not go in in this and I told them, you have the Hitler and your orders, explain to them he was a bad man and all the thing explained in their own -- in their own level, for them to understand.</span> <span id="s2361">And then we used to give them those tiles, they used to paint on the tiles and then they put it down, whatever their feelings in their heart.</span> <span id="s2362">And the best tiles are now in -- on the wall in Washington.</span> <span id="s2363">Down there where you go down on the -- on the left hand after a whole wall.</span> <span id="s2364">This is the tiles where I used to go down there and work with the kids.</span> <span id="s2365">Now they minimized this one, ‘Remember the Children’, they made it Daniel’s story -- out of it.</span> <span id="s2366">So this is the Daniel’s story, next -- you know, coming after ‘Remember the Children’.</span></p> <p><span id="s2367">Q: You continued to speak to -- have you continued to speak to civic groups and youth groups up until the present day?</span></p> <p><span id="s2368">A: I did.</span> <span id="s2369">I did -- I didn’t do for awhile and I’m afraid if I’m not rusty already, I have to write it down.</span> <span id="s2370">Sometimes I say it just from my remembering, but I -- I think I have to -- I didn’t do it for awhile but I -- I like to.</span> <span id="s2371">I used to do it a lot of m-more in Washington.</span> <span id="s2372">And here I go also.</span> <span id="s2373">Once in awhile here, once in awhile there to -- to tell my story.</span> <span id="s2374">Yes, this is a letter I received from a student after I shared my story with them and I thought -- I was very touched and I thought I should read it -- I should read it here today.</span> <span id="s2375">First he addressed to me, giving to his teacher because I didn’t give out my -- my address.</span> <span id="s2376">And he said to me, “Thank you for giving that remarkable, tragic story of your youth experience.</span> <span id="s2377">I know no one that wasn’t there could understand the pain and toro -- and torment or could give you enough apologies or forgiveness.</span> <span id="s2378">But I’ll try to understand and feel what you have felt.</span> <span id="s2379">I also know -- I also know that there are those trails to be dealt with.</span> <span id="s2380">I want to convert in being a Jew, with your help, I would like to be one.</span> <span id="s2381">Please get in contact with me.”</span> <span id="s2382">And he signed his name, Isaac.</span></p> <p><span id="s2383">Q: And you said something about -- tell me something about this school or the background of this young man.</span> <span id="s2384">Where he -- do you know anything about him?</span></p> <p><span id="s2385">A: It -- it was -- later I find out it was -- it was in a poor section, it was a lody infested with drugs.</span> <span id="s2386">I didn’t know at that time.</span> <span id="s2387">But after I went and I spoke to this group and there were this girl -- after my -- after my addressing and after my telling my story, the teacher came to me, she said, “Mrs. Senders you know, you don’t know how much good you did.”</span> <span id="s2388">I said, “What did I do, I just told my story.”</span> <span id="s2389">He said, “This girl had ta -- she was a drug addict and she had to had the fix at the certain time and time when you spoke.</span> <span id="s2390">And she didn’t went to take her fix, she was so interested and so absorbed and so in -- in your story, that she stayed through all this time.”</span> <span id="s2391">And it touched me very, very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s2392">Q: What happened with this young man, did he convert to Judaism?</span></p> <p><span id="s2393">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2394">I called him up, he gave me his telephone through the teacher and I said, “This is not my mission, to convert nobody.</span> <span id="s2395">If you want to convert to Judaism, you have to find your own way, how to do it, through some other channels, but this is just me telling and sharing my story, what I went through and this should never happen to no one.”</span> <span id="s2396">And there was another student in this same -- in this same school and he was a student from a mixed marriage.</span> <span id="s2397">His mother was German, his father was American.</span> <span id="s2398">And he -- and he said he’s going to Germany to see his grandparents.</span> <span id="s2399">So I said, “You heard my story,” I said, “can you give me a promise?”</span> <span id="s2400">I said to talk to your grandparents and to tell them.</span> <span id="s2401">And I think this was my reward that day for speaking to those kids.</span> <span id="s2402">I said, “Tell them exactly in the words I told you.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2403">Q: Did he say that he would?</span></p> <p><span id="s2404">A: And he promised he would.</span></p> <p><span id="s2405">Q: Did you ever hear what the results of that were?</span></p> <p><span id="s2406">A: No.</span> <span id="s2407">I did not -- I did not follow up on -- on things, you know, I didn’t follow up.</span> <span id="s2408">But this was a very, very impressive -- I touched -- I was touched by it.</span> <span id="s2409">Because the kids listened, the kids understood and this is something.</span></p> <p><span id="s2410">Q: And it was not only that they listened and understood, but this young man was so moved --</span></p> <p><span id="s2411">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2412">Q: By what you said, that he wanted to become a Jew --</span></p> <p><span id="s2413">A: That he want actually to convert to Judaism.</span></p> <p><span id="s2414">Q: That’s great.</span></p> <p><span id="s2415">A: That’s -- yeah, I thought so very much.</span> <span id="s2416">It was very -- and I -- I said to him, “Do you want all this trouble?”</span> <span id="s2417">You know, I mades a little joke with him, that’s all.</span> <span id="s2418">But I never followed up.</span> <span id="s2419">Maybe I should, or don’t, I don’t know, but I never did.</span></p> <p><span id="s2420">Q: When did you -- was there a point where you started to feel that you were an American, that you were at home here?</span></p> <p><span id="s2421">A: You know, when I was very frightened was the McCarthy era?</span> <span id="s2422">Was very, very -- to us survivor, it was -- it was very unpleasant.</span> <span id="s2423">But then, whatever we went through, I said, “This our home.”</span> <span id="s2424">This -- I felt more comfortable each year as I -- the kids are growing up, going to school and I felt more comfortable each year.</span> <span id="s2425">This is my country -- there where I live and I am a part of it.</span> <span id="s2426">But my story should go, I think, from generation to generation.</span> <span id="s2427">People should learn from our experience.</span> <span id="s2428">It’s a big responsibility, but we’ll do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2429">Q: Tell me more about that -- the M-McCarthy era and what -- what you experienced.</span></p> <p><span id="s2430">A: It’s a frightening thing, was it.</span> <span id="s2431">With all the accusation, with all the -- the Communist, not Communist, the thing -- all this -- this thing, it was mixed up and it -- and we went -- we were there -- we came here and it didn’t -- some of the things didn’t even make sense to us.</span> <span id="s2432">T-Turn around people upside down to make labels on them, to -- and it was -- it’s like a reverse, like coming back.</span> <span id="s2433">And it was -- to me it was a very -- a very -- a very frightful thing and a very worrisome -- not fright -- a worrisome thing.</span> <span id="s2434">I said, “God almighty, we went through a war and -- what you see, we’re living through that, too.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2435">Q: Were people -- did people discriminate against you for being from this -- from what they considered the Soviet block?</span> <span id="s2436">I know there was a lot of paranoia, so you -- did you experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s2437">A: A lot of paranoia, it was -- didn’t had no ground for it.</span> <span id="s2438">It didn’t had -- they portray all these -- the Russian like they would be stupid til the Sputnik come into being.</span> <span id="s2439">And here I came from down there and I know the people were very smart and I remember Mrs. Roosevelt in the 50’s, went to the Soviet Union, she came back and she said, “There are certain things we can learn from them.</span> <span id="s2440">Their educational system,” I remember distinctly the way she said it, “we can learn from them certain things.”</span> <span id="s2441">And it’s -- and -- and I agreed at that time because you know -- you know, if you want, like I think Eisenhower said it, if you want to fight the enemy, you have to know your enemy.</span> <span id="s2442">And there are certain traits, good traits you have to learn from.</span> <span id="s2443">And -- so this was -- this was a s-struck me a little bit f-funny.</span> <span id="s2444">But then, little by little, I -- I said, “We are a part of this universe and we are here to stay.</span> <span id="s2445">And the choice’ll be ours.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2446">Q: It must have been, I mean, that -- that -- that -- the Cold War going on for -- for decades with -- with the -- the -- the Soviet Union.</span></p> <p><span id="s2447">A: This -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2448">Q: And was that in some way difficult for you, because you were supported by the Soviets through the war in some way and -- and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2449">A: When I came out to speak, I -- I explained to the kids, “Listen, Japan was our enemies yesterday, today they our friends.”</span> <span id="s2450">To make sense out of the whole -- the whole thing.</span> <span id="s2451">So I said, “They’re -- they were our enemies.</span> <span id="s2452">They were arch enemies.</span> <span id="s2453">What they did in -- in -- in Pearl -- in Pearl Harbor.</span> <span id="s2454">And here,” I said, “the Soviets, don’t forget, they were our allies.</span> <span id="s2455">It was a choice between two evils and Hitler was the master of evils.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2456">Q: Did it seem strange to the -- to you that the United States took such a friendly relationship with Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s2457">A: Somewhat, yet.</span> <span id="s2458">I feel like when, who said it, I’m a Berlinner?</span> <span id="s2459">Something that struck me little bit in the funny way.</span> <span id="s2460">Me, [inaudible].</span> <span id="s2461">I think some -- all survivors felt the same.</span> <span id="s2462">And they have to still repent.</span> <span id="s2463">And I understand what revolution right now in Germany is the book by the author -- the author’s name is Daniel John Goldhagen, “Hitler’s Willing Executioners.”</span> <span id="s2464">Made a big like -- revelation in Germany.</span> <span id="s2465">The youth at the third generation are as -- are asking question their grandparents.</span> <span id="s2466">“What did you do, why did it happen?”</span> <span id="s2467">They find out the real -- the real thing about the past behind.</span> <span id="s2468">So this is something is turning around, slowly, but maybe in the right direction.</span></p> <p><span id="s2469">Q: Do you remember that -- the moment that was all over the news that the Berlin wall was coming down and -- and that -- that Communist era was -- of the Soviet Block was coming to an end and -- and there was c -- there was suddenly this freedom among those nations.</span> <span id="s2470">Do you remember what you felt?</span></p> <p><span id="s2471">A: I felt sort of resentment about the Germans and -- and the Berlin wall I thought maybe was the price they had to pay, maybe more so.</span> <span id="s2472">But this Berlin wall was maybe a price they had to pay for the atrocities and the horrible things they have done to other human beings.</span> <span id="s2473">They’re other human beings, that’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s2474">Q: Did it seem that -- I think for many Americans, there was the sense that suddenly this whole world that was closed before, suddenly became open and it was possible to go visit and it was possible to -- you know, if you wanted to go to Poland or if you wanted to go to -- it was going to be easier and there -- there was going to be access in some way.</span> <span id="s2475">Did you have that feeling, did you start to think about the possibility of -- of returning to your hometown and seeing what it -- ha-had become of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2476">A: For a long time, no, but now later I wanted just for a visit.</span> <span id="s2477">I would never return to live there, never.</span> <span id="s2478">There is nothing except the cemetery and I am not about to go.</span> <span id="s2479">They did to their own people and it’s not worth it to go and be among -- be amongst them -- to their own citizen and as I said, I was a national Pole.</span> <span id="s2480">That’s all.</span> <span id="s2481">If I went out from the country, it’s nobody’s business was religion I -- I accept -- if I don’t eat this type of food or something, but this is nobody’s business.</span> <span id="s2482">But I was a Polish national.</span> <span id="s2483">And here we became criminals.</span> <span id="s2484">And this is, yes the resentment I had.</span> <span id="s2485">They help didn’t -- the people gave us very, very little help.</span> <span id="s2486">They paid a price too, afterwards.</span> <span id="s2487">The revolt in -- in Warsaw ghetto, the -- in the war -- after the Warsaw ghetto, the revolt in -- in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s2488">They start doing to the Poles, to the -- to the -- to the Catholics, little by little the same thing.</span> <span id="s2489">But they were already -- they already cut out -- they minimized already the Jews.</span> <span id="s2490">They would have a bigger force to get together and fight their enemy, but they didn’t use their heads.</span> <span id="s2491">So I -- they betrayed us and I felt very much betrayed by my own countrymen.</span> <span id="s2492">And that’s the thing I have to deal with.</span></p> <p><span id="s2493">Q: Tell me about how you -- how you educated your children, what your goals were of -- of what to teach them.</span> <span id="s2494">What -- what was important to you that you conveyed to them about -- from your own life experiences about what they should -- what they should know for their own -- for their own lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s2495">A: To stand on their feet and take no -- no nonsense, you know, play with the kids, not to let nobody to abuse them.</span> <span id="s2496">Tell them in a nice way once, twice and the third time give it back to the kid who bothers you.</span> <span id="s2497">I told them I will not fight your fight.</span> <span id="s2498">You have to stand on your own two feet and fight them.</span> <span id="s2499">I told them to be decent, to be understanding to other people, but never to be intimidated by nobody and nothing.</span> <span id="s2500">We are a part of this universe and we’ll stay here forever and the choice will be ours, whatever religion each one of us will choose.</span> <span id="s2501">If we choose to be Jews, we will be that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2502">Q: Did they ask you about your experiences during the Holocaust and -- and your husband’s experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s2503">A: They know.</span> <span id="s2504">My Sherry went -- my Sherry was in -- in -- well, she went actually when I spoke down there at the United Jewish Appeal, she was present and she was in support, you know, she was sitting in the audience and she listening and I said, “You [indecipherable] or something bore to listen.”</span> <span id="s2505">And she said it was okay.</span> <span id="s2506">So they know all about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2507">Q: When they were children, did they?</span> <span id="s2508">Did they know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2509">A: No.</span> <span id="s2510">When they were very young, if they ask me I s -- I told them.</span> <span id="s2511">I didn’t -- for hiding, in my case.</span> <span id="s2512">I’m not speaking for the other ones, in my case.</span> <span id="s2513">They cames once, was a Catholic kid teased, theys tel-telling the stories and I said it, “Just tell them off, just go and tell them off.”</span> <span id="s2514">They give me some -- I said, “I’m not mixing any your fights, you’ll have to fight your own fight.</span> <span id="s2515">With grown-ups I will not ask you to fight for me, nor with the kids.”</span> <span id="s2516">And I remember one of my neighbor, ones that -- she was like a referee, she used to go out and fight for the kids and this and then, til all of a sudden sh -- come and tell me stories, this, that, this one fight thats one and the other one fight the other one.</span> <span id="s2517">And I said, “Evelyn, you wanted to be a referee, it’s your business.</span> <span id="s2518">I’m not mixing in.”</span> <span id="s2519">I said, “You know the kids, they will fight and in two minutes they will play together.</span> <span id="s2520">Me and you,” I said, “we will have a fight and a good one and we will not talk any more.</span> <span id="s2521">So I am not about, so --.”</span> <span id="s2522">You know she start laughing and that’s it and that was the end of it.</span> <span id="s2523">I -- you know you have to, in everything it’s -- there is I think, logic.</span> <span id="s2524">To understand life the way it is, not to find any -- all the -- the -- the junk in life.</span> <span id="s2525">To find something good.</span> <span id="s2526">And to convey to the next -- first of all in your family, it’s where the nucleus, where the -- where it starts, all those things.</span> <span id="s2527">And actually, practice what you preach or don’t say nothing.</span> <span id="s2528">Actually do practice what you -- what you say.</span> <span id="s2529">And I think of families, they’re okay.</span> <span id="s2530">Maybe I’m li -- but lucky also, you know, there was a period with the drugs and things, it was a little bit uneasy, but everything is all right.</span> <span id="s2531">So I don’t know what we knew, but that’s the way it is.</span> <span id="s2532">I did what I thought it’s right and I think eventually it comes out right, if you do what’s right.</span> <span id="s2533">It’s not what you say to the kids, what you do -- what you do.</span> <span id="s2534">That’s my understanding.</span></p> <p><span id="s2535">Q: What did you teach them about Judaism?</span></p> <p><span id="s2536">A: About Judaism, I told them -- we were not exactly a religious, more traditional Jews.</span> <span id="s2537">They know how much I’ve -- we suffered being -- being of that faith.</span> <span id="s2538">Our -- our -- both daughters are not religious.</span> <span id="s2539">They observe the holidays when they come, they know it, but they are not [inaudible].</span> <span id="s2540">I myself -- our son more would go -- like to go to synagogue, to pray.</span> <span id="s2541">The holidays he takes his son.</span> <span id="s2542">And also we tass, we go -- we belong to a synagogue and we go down there, it’s Conservative.</span> <span id="s2543">And it’s more tradition with me.</span> <span id="s2544">And I say there is a Hebrew saying, “I have a dintata with God.”</span> <span id="s2545">I have a grievance, I have a dispute with God.</span> <span id="s2546">Why did it happen to our people?</span> <span id="s2547">And there is God, why was there silence?</span> <span id="s2548">And that’s the answer, I guess you have all was [inaudible].</span></p> <p><span id="s2549">Q: Do you ever question your belief in God?</span></p> <p><span id="s2550">A: Not -- I question.</span> <span id="s2551">I don’t know, I go to synagogue and I do my -- it’s -- it’s more -- it’s pleasant, it’s nice.</span> <span id="s2552">When I came to the swartzva, I-I question it.</span> <span id="s2553">How come?</span> <span id="s2554">How did it happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s2555">Q: You were raising your children -- well, in the post-war era there were so many changes in the culture here and some of them happened very quickly, particularly in the 60’s, when -- when there was the -- the -- the landing on the moon and the -- the Vietnam War, late 60’s and -- and then the Feminist movement and the Civil Rights movement and then there was the Free Love and you mentioned dru -- your fear of -- of your kids getting involved in drugs, but wh -- did you feel like all of the -- did you feel any identification with these movements that were happening, or interest in -- in these movements or did you sort of want to protect your family from -- from all of these changes?</span> <span id="s2556">I don’t know if you can speak that generally, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s2557">A: It was -- it was changes happening and it was certainly interesting.</span> <span id="s2558">You know, the -- the women -- equally -- what do we call it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2559">Q: Equal Rights --</span></p> <p><span id="s2560">A: The Equal Rights --</span></p> <p><span id="s2561">Q: Am-Amend-Amendment?</span></p> <p><span id="s2562">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2563">Yeah, because it was interesting and it was okay.</span> <span id="s2564">Sometimes they started asking me -- as soon as we are liberated?</span> <span id="s2565">“I don’t know,” I said, “I didn’t -- I -- we not -- we did not use at that time the word.”</span> <span id="s2566">I guess I was.</span> <span id="s2567">I was in my action.</span> <span id="s2568">So I -- you understand?</span> <span id="s2569">It was interesting, because after I see the abuse in families and all those things with th -- husband and wife.</span> <span id="s2570">We -- I never saw in our family, I never saw in my surrounding, where I was in my little, in -- in my family down there, but then I start, you know, I heard it’s all this abuse and all this -- this -- this -- this -- this bad things.</span> <span id="s2571">So it was -- it was interesting.</span> <span id="s2572">It was something moving, something going.</span> <span id="s2573">It came a little bit mo -- to a lot of extremes, but it’s comes to the extremes and then it’s levels off.</span> <span id="s2574">And -- and in the 60’s, we did drugs, I was a little bit concerned.</span> <span id="s2575">I said, “This is bad.”</span> <span id="s2576">I used to tell my kids, you know, “I don’t need drugs, just touch me.</span> <span id="s2577">I’m full of life, without drugs.”</span> <span id="s2578">I don’t need it.</span> <span id="s2579">You don’t need to -- to -- to get -- to get the drugs to numb yourself.</span> <span id="s2580">Why?</span> <span id="s2581">Do you think this is something?</span> <span id="s2582">It’s a drug in your body.</span> <span id="s2583">I use to explain, but this was like -- like in style, like it comes like a -- like a yo-yo, it’s comes like a thing and it’s -- you know, the kids get involved and the pressure in schools and all those things.</span> <span id="s2584">And I used to watch my kids.</span> <span id="s2585">I remember my middle daughter was a little bit a revolutionary.</span> <span id="s2586">You know, more in -- in Los Angeles.</span> <span id="s2587">And she came when Woodstock came about.</span> <span id="s2588">Woodstock.</span> <span id="s2589">She came to me and she said she wants to go to Woodstock.</span> <span id="s2590">I didn’t know Woodstock from another city.</span> <span id="s2591">Did I know Woodstock?</span> <span id="s2592">I said, “Who is going to Woodstock?</span> <span id="s2593">What is Woodstock?</span> <span id="s2594">Where is it?”</span> <span id="s2595">She start telling me some -- it is in New York and kids are going.</span> <span id="s2596">It’s who is going and how many kids are going, some of your friend?</span> <span id="s2597">I start asking all those questions and right away she start telling me a lot of kids, Woodstock, where is that?</span> <span id="s2598">I said, “No, let them go, you are not going.</span> <span id="s2599">No way, over my dead body, you are not going,” I said.</span> <span id="s2600">She was a -- a kid on -- a kid -- not -- n -- I don’t remember how -- how old was she at that time when Woodstock was.</span> <span id="s2601">I said, “No way.”</span> <span id="s2602">It’s something I felt -- I sensed intuitively.</span> <span id="s2603">There is a danger down there.</span> <span id="s2604">And you see what happened.</span> <span id="s2605">They almost -- it almost tump, you know, the stampedoed.</span> <span id="s2606">There was not the facilities, not even water -- drinking water down there for the kids.</span> <span id="s2607">So I -- I sensed it, maybe from my experience, or just I sensed it -- it’s something wrong in that situation.</span> <span id="s2608">Oh, she started wearing those, I remember some kind of -- from a rag she made something.</span> <span id="s2609">You know, the Arab and the kids are all doing all those things.</span> <span id="s2610">And it’s also struck me funny, we had beggars who used to go around with those things.</span> <span id="s2611">And she thought she will talk me into some nonsense, I said, “No way.”</span> <span id="s2612">But I let it, you know, freedom, I did not constantly, I said, “Let her see it their own way.</span> <span id="s2613">Let her see it’s not the right thing.”</span> <span id="s2614">And somehow they grow up, all of them, from -- End of Tape Four, Side A Beginning of Tape Four, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s2615">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2616">That’s the way it works, statistically.</span></p> <p><span id="s2617">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2618">Q: This is a continuation of an interview with Brenda Senders.</span> <span id="s2619">This is tape four, side B.</span> <span id="s2620">You were -- you were in the middle of saying something, I’ll wait my question.</span></p> <p><span id="s2621">A: What is?</span></p> <p><span id="s2622">Q: I’ll go ahead and ask a question unless you -- were you in the middle of saying something?</span> <span id="s2623">No?</span></p> <p><span id="s2624">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2625">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2626">You mentioned the -- the Feminist movement and the Equal Rights Amendment and the -- the -- that that was sort of interesting to you.</span> <span id="s2627">You ha-had obviously had an experience during the war of -- of doing something that many of us might consider being stereotypically male.</span> <span id="s2628">You were fighting with a partisan group.</span> <span id="s2629">You -- you learned how to ride a horse and ho -- shoot a gun.</span> <span id="s2630">So -- so in some ways, th -- would you say those divisions didn’t exist in your mind, of the male role and the female role?</span></p> <p><span id="s2631">A: Not re -- I said it’s another human being, I -- I saw it.</span> <span id="s2632">And some -- and some girls did, some attached themselves down there to some man.</span> <span id="s2633">It didn’t work out anyway.</span> <span id="s2634">But they attached themself and it -- and it went from the office and it did not -- it did not work, it didn’t make sense.</span> <span id="s2635">They thought maybe they’ll get her e-easy, I don’t know what -- what made them, what motivated them.</span> <span id="s2636">You understand?</span> <span id="s2637">But for my part, I saw it -- it was wrong.</span> <span id="s2638">I’m doing anyway, so what I have to -- if I don’t want to, I don’t want to.</span> <span id="s2639">I saw them as another human being.</span> <span id="s2640">And it was difficult.</span> <span id="s2641">You know, it was still, you know -- but somehow we didn’t sense -- it’s funny we didn’t sense at that time, because the girls and the boys, we were -- we were fighting, like, the same fight.</span> <span id="s2642">Maybe in other groups, in other -- I don’t know, but that’s the way I was surrounding and I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s2643">Q: So when -- when women were fighting for Equal Rights in the United States, in the 1960’s and 70’s, could you relate to their -- to their struggle?</span></p> <p><span id="s2644">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2645">After I heard, you know, the -- the -- what happened and what -- what they are fighting, you understand, you cannot just fight for something that’s not in existence, but it’s -- it [indecipherable] were abusing, where a man, you know this macho man, they thought they are -- who knows, they are almighty.</span> <span id="s2646">And -- and the woman had to stay home and -- and -- and be like, you know, a little slave girl or whatever.</span> <span id="s2647">And if they wanted, at will, they would run around an-and she -- you know it was not a equal, it was not the right, the right partnership.</span> <span id="s2648">It was not the right -- and this -- that I thought this is -- I agreed with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2649">Q: In the 19 -- starting in the mid-1950’s and then especially in the 1960’s, were you following the events of the Civil Rights movement and did that -- did that have any sort of resonance for you, that -- that here’s this minority struggling for -- for equal rights?</span></p> <p><span id="s2650">A: For equal rights, yeah.</span> <span id="s2651">I thought people -- people are people, they should have, definitely.</span> <span id="s2652">They were oppressed.</span> <span id="s2653">We used to see them oversea in Europe and we don’t like it.</span> <span id="s2654">And especially this [indecipherable] serve -- the way they beat them, the way they -- they kill them, the way they lynch them.</span> <span id="s2655">And we were -- a lody -- a lody of the movies we saw in Europe.</span> <span id="s2656">And this is -- it was re-revolting to me.</span> <span id="s2657">I said, “They are people.</span> <span id="s2658">They are struggling, this their right.”</span> <span id="s2659">You know, they were not asked to be brought here into the States.</span> <span id="s2660">They were brought for the convenience at that time, for the white.</span> <span id="s2661">Now they’re -- they -- they’re emancipated, they’re -- they’re free.</span> <span id="s2662">So we should have -- I don’t know, if have respect for ourselves, we should have respect for the next person, if he wants to better himself, if he wants to go out [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2663">Not to keep him enslaved.</span></p> <p><span id="s2664">Q: You mentioned that when you lived in Washington, DC, you would go and s-speak in schools in poor areas of town and a lot of the kid --</span></p> <p><span id="s2665">A: [indecipherable] yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2666">Q: A lot of the kids were black kids that you were speaking to.</span> <span id="s2667">How did -- h -- di -- do you -- did you find that they could really relate to your story because of their similar experiences as far as being -- being oppressed and discriminated against?</span></p> <p><span id="s2668">A: Maybe some did.</span> <span id="s2669">Some did.</span> <span id="s2670">You know, n -- you cannot generalize things.</span> <span id="s2671">Some did, a lot that did identified.</span> <span id="s2672">I remember some -- this black kid went through and I felt this respect, plain.</span> <span id="s2673">You understand, after I -- his respect, like -- like I feel the energy of that towards me, like he touched me.</span> <span id="s2674">And I felt it.</span> <span id="s2675">And some other kids responded to me, but also white kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s2676">Q: Did you mention that the kid who wrote the letter that you read earlier was black?</span></p> <p><span id="s2677">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2678">I -- I know -- I don’t know if I mentioned, but he was a black guy, yes and a very fine man.</span> <span id="s2679">So, wherever I was asked to speak, I went to share my story with that.</span> <span id="s2680">And I think I made a difference, I would say so, I think so.</span> <span id="s2681">If I did anything good, so I’m glad.</span></p> <p><span id="s2682">Q: Your sister also moved to Washington.</span></p> <p><span id="s2683">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2684">Q: W-Were y -- was your relationship with her especially close, seeing as y-you had both gone through these experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s2685">A: [indecipherable] friction amongst, you know, we’re different -- different completely.</span> <span id="s2686">It’s like rivalry sometimes, but, you know, deep down there, we do.</span> <span id="s2687">You know, we went through the war.</span> <span id="s2688">There were times where she almost gave up and I dragged her out, I pulled her out from a mess.</span> <span id="s2689">But deep down there -- but there is some rivalry, something she would tell me and she doesn’t mean it, and then I overlook things, I don’t pay attention to her.</span> <span id="s2690">Or maybe I would criticize her more than I should and I shouldn’t.</span> <span id="s2691">Then later I find out.</span> <span id="s2692">But on deep down there, of course.</span> <span id="s2693">She’s now in Washington, so she -- my son, she’s like second mother, you know and she’s single now.</span> <span id="s2694">She was married, divorced and she didn’t want it, to be married any more.</span> <span id="s2695">So we see each other when I come to Washington.</span></p> <p><span id="s2696">Q: Did you foll -- I’m sure you -- you did, you -- you mentioned you had worked with the Israel Bond and the Golda Meir group.</span></p> <p><span id="s2697">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2698">Q: Were you following closely the events that -- that were happening and have been happening in Israel over the years?</span></p> <p><span id="s2699">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2700">Very much.</span> <span id="s2701">The ‘67 war [indecipherable] it was very much, very much.</span> <span id="s2702">I almost was ready to go and to go down there and stay with my people.</span> <span id="s2703">It was very hurtful and I looked at the United Nation and we went away from the -- from the television, it was like a circus on there.</span> <span id="s2704">Like everybody would gang up on this little country and it’s people, who went through such a horrible time.</span> <span id="s2705">And mostly a lot of people are composed from people like me, survivors.</span> <span id="s2706">And why again?</span> <span id="s2707">Because of their oil?</span> <span id="s2708">And this was very, very hard to digest.</span> <span id="s2709">But thanks God, I followed warias.</span></p> <p><span id="s2710">Q: And what about the position of Israel in the wor -- in the world today and the -- the situation there now?</span> <span id="s2711">How does that -- what’s your position on that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2712">A: I think the Israelis have to decide on that -- they are doing a pretty good job on that.</span> <span id="s2713">I can -- I want it to be a nation that’s -- historically it belongs to the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s2714">From way, way, it’s not from Pharaoh’s time.</span> <span id="s2715">And nobody can take away from that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2716">Q: You think that there’s a solution to the -- to the problems that are -- or do you think that that’s possible?</span></p> <p><span id="s2717">A: That’s possible?</span> <span id="s2718">I think so.</span> <span id="s2719">And they’ll make the enemy to understand and not to give in.</span> <span id="s2720">In my books, appeasement doesn’t work.</span> <span id="s2721">Giving in to the enemies doesn’t work.</span> <span id="s2722">As more as you give, the more they want, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s2723">Q: So you don’t think compromise is the right word?</span></p> <p><span id="s2724">A: Compromise is, yes.</span> <span id="s2725">If -- if they are logical, compromise is yes.</span> <span id="s2726">But what are we talking?</span> <span id="s2727">It’s a little country, you understand?</span> <span id="s2728">The logic’ll fit.</span> <span id="s2729">Let’s say we are talking about iron prayer.</span> <span id="s2730">The -- if we talk about, you know, I’m not going in politics, I’m not -- I’m an American, but this is a small country, surrounded all by the enemies.</span> <span id="s2731">And they wanted peace.</span> <span id="s2732">But let looks the other side, you have to be objective and look at it.</span> <span id="s2733">And they, you know, like -- this is a little bit, you know, not frightened -- Israel will be here forever.</span> <span id="s2734">It’s here to stay.</span> <span id="s2735">But it is a concern, yeah.</span> <span id="s2736">It’s a wonderful little country and it’s democracy in the Middle East and it’s the only democracy and they’re our friends.</span> <span id="s2737">And you know, I would talk about -- I always show a map, take a look on that teensy weensy Israel and thanks God for they’re round me and they are strong.</span> <span id="s2738">And my -- my thing, you see, during my second World War, the experience, the way it were, if he would have been stopped, if Hitler would have been stopped after he crossed Austria, the Anschluss and then you see?</span> <span id="s2739">The appetite came, in the Anschluss and then he started harassing Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s2740">I remember we had a friend, a Czechoslovakian friend, she cried.</span> <span id="s2741">I remember I stood next to my mother, she cried with tears, poor thing, she was adorable lady.</span> <span id="s2742">They had a -- a wursht store, you know, from salamis?</span> <span id="s2743">And they were such a neat people, grade -- we used to come down there and buy for our grocery.</span> <span id="s2744">And when they -- when they -- when they invaded Czechoslovakia, she cried with tears in her eyes.</span> <span id="s2745">And you see what happened?</span> <span id="s2746">They gave him a free hand and what happened?</span> <span id="s2747">So if he would have been stopped, he wouldn’t have the guts to do it -- what he did to a lot of people.</span> <span id="s2748">And then he started harassing and we know it from history, what the next step was.</span> <span id="s2749">So that’s the way I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2750">Q: Tell a little bit more a-about your work with Israel Bond and -- and what was your role with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s2751">A: First I was working for different organization, anything that was help out our people.</span> <span id="s2752">That’s in Washington, doing the job.</span> <span id="s2753">Israel Bond’s, then I created a - a rummage store, it was making money for the organization.</span> <span id="s2754">I was working for years in there and then I got involved with your museum and the survivors group and the Bond’s I guess too, they were involved.</span> <span id="s2755">So this was my involvement in the organizations.</span> <span id="s2756">I think B’nai Brith I was once honored with something, gave me some kind of plaque or whatever, way, way back.</span> <span id="s2757">I don’t remember what year it was.</span> <span id="s2758">End of May -- argolot or something, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s2759">And whenever I was cold, I used to go out and tell my stories, especially at the schools.</span> <span id="s2760">What?</span></p> <p><span id="s2761">Q: Well, we never mentioned how you moved to Florida, I guess that -- that happened after your husband retired, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2762">A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2763">Q: That’s -- and that was how many years ago?</span></p> <p><span id="s2764">A: It was eight years ago, eight and ni -- ‘89, that’s eight years ago.</span> <span id="s2765">So -- yeah -- no, not eight.</span></p> <p><span id="s2766">Q: Nine?</span></p> <p><span id="s2767">A: Mm-hm, nine years ago, we moved to Florida and yeah, my husband retired, our son took over the business and we had a little setback down there and he didn’t wanted to be involved any more, it was too hard for him and so he decided not to mix in any more in the business, our son took over and -- and he wanted very much to go to Florida, I was not prepared for it.</span> <span id="s2768">Somehow, not mentally, not -- I thought all old people and I was not young, but I was not mentally old -- in something, in my mind I thought that old people are going to Florida.</span> <span id="s2769">And it’s not so.</span> <span id="s2770">Then I find out it’s not the -- the situation, because we -- we meet people from all kind, they’re good friends and -- and I -- I like it in here.</span> <span id="s2771">Lifestyle, i-it’s nice, it’s very simple and it’s -- it’s nice.</span> <span id="s2772">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s2773">Q: Have you -- did the -- I’m just -- I -- I’ve mentioned to you since I’ve been here that you’re -- you have such a beautiful home and of course, anyone listening to this tape can’t -- can’t see it, but it’s full of art and paintings and -- and everything’s very artfully arranged.</span> <span id="s2774">Is this something that you arranged yourself or did you have somebody in for th --</span></p> <p><span id="s2775">A: I had -- the paintings I arranged myself, I had -- I had a professional help, she helped me out the -- to put together things, but the paintings, I take full credit for them.</span> <span id="s2776">I put them out there all the way I saw it, the way I like it and the way they should be.</span> <span id="s2777">And I think they -- they are in good order, the way I like it, I don’t know, may -- how somebody would see it differently.</span> <span id="s2778">But I -- I like it the way it is.</span> <span id="s2779">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2780">Q: And I’d say that this -- that your home has an -- a feeling of peacefulness in it and tranquility, which is maybe notable since you’ve -- you’ve gone through such turbulence --</span></p> <p><span id="s2781">A: Turbulence.</span></p> <p><span id="s2782">Q: D-Do you feel -- do you feel a sense of peace now in your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s2783">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2784">More so.</span> <span id="s2785">I’m constantly in demand of myself.</span> <span id="s2786">Brenda, you have to -- you have to do more, you have to -- you have to -- to go -- you have to do something.</span> <span id="s2787">Something in me demands out of me.</span> <span id="s2788">I should more for the museum, more for this.</span> <span id="s2789">I was invited maybe to come, to speak to a group of young people.</span> <span id="s2790">I’ll go and do it.</span> <span id="s2791">I -- but this is -- this is the thing, I said, maybe it’s very important.</span> <span id="s2792">I feel it’s very important.</span> <span id="s2793">And that’s the demand on me.</span> <span id="s2794">But are -- are -- are there ways?</span> <span id="s2795">Yes, we live a peaceful life now.</span> <span id="s2796">Of course, the every day worries, sometimes -- he worry about this, worry about thing, but this is normal -- normal -- normal occurrence, normal happenings in life.</span></p> <p><span id="s2797">Q: Is there anything else that you’d like to say, any mess -- I mean you can -- you can say a message that you’d like to leave for future generations or -- and anything at all that you’d like to say.</span></p> <p><span id="s2798">A: Be brave in any situation.</span> <span id="s2799">We used to say in the partisan.</span> <span id="s2800">Smele ova pulon nedbeerot.</span> <span id="s2801">It’s means a brave person, the bullet doesn’t get him.</span> <span id="s2802">You can die standing up or you can die laying down.</span> <span id="s2803">Not to be intimidated and nobody -- don’t think that somebody -- we’re all human beings and not to let yourself be intimidated by nothing and nobody.</span> <span id="s2804">And stand and fight for the right, if you feel it right.</span> <span id="s2805">That’s my understanding of life.</span> <span id="s2806">And we as survivor will do our job.</span> <span id="s2807">Never again will happen to my people, first, and to no people.</span> <span id="s2808">What the else can I say?</span> <span id="s2809">For my children will have to have their own life and their own choices and I think their choices are right ones.</span> <span id="s2810">They’re good human beings and each one knows what’s right, understands what’s right is.</span> <span id="s2811">I think -- I don’t know, I didn’t teach them, you know, what -- you know, my experience.</span> <span id="s2812">Somehow -- how do we say, I don’t know how to put in words.</span> <span id="s2813">We say example, that’s all.</span> <span id="s2814">Stand on your two feet and be counted, whatever nat and that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2815">Q: Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s2816">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2817">Q: This
