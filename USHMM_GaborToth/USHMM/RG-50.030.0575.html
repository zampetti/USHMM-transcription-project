you let me know a little bit about the beginnings of your story; where you were born; who were your parents; what you know about them?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: My name is Lily Kaszamerski(ph) or Kaszamerska(ph), and I was born in Warsaw, Poland – Poland.</span> <span id="s16">And my parents’ names were Ada Berlind(ph) Oberlanski(ph).</span> <span id="s17">My father’s name was Ian Kaszamerski(ph).</span> <span id="s18">I know that they both were born in po – in Warsaw, I’m not sure, because I don’t remember them.</span> <span id="s19">And I also know that they – my mother had a brother – her brother, and he survived the war.</span> <span id="s20">He managed to escape the war in the middle of the war, and find himself in Paris.</span> <span id="s21">And after the war he opened a nightclub.</span> <span id="s22">He was a musician.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: Zigmund Berlind(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: And did you ever meet him?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: No.</span> <span id="s27">I met his wife many, many years later.</span> <span id="s28">I didn’t meet him, he died in 1953.</span> <span

Israel, I think that that’s when he found me.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: That is, he found out that you were in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: But he never – you two never came together.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: No, he didn’t – but I think that it wasn’t enough time, just – but he wrote to me through my adopted mother, cause they corresponded in Polish, and I didn't know Polish at the time, already.</span> <span id="s37">I forgot it.</span> <span id="s38">And the sad story about it, about the fact that I didn’t meet them, n-neither his or – him or his wife at that time, I – and th-the other sad thing is that I don’t have any track of that letters that gone between my adopted mother and himself.</span> <span id="s39">So, I don’t know anything.</span> <span id="s40">And I think that – that my adopted mother didn’t ask the right questions, because if she would, maybe I would know where I come from, street, who were my parents, what did they do.</span> <span id="s41">I don’t know anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: Well, this was my next question, is what are your – what do you know of your family, and was he, your uncle, probably the only tie to be able to tell you something about them?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: Yeah, but what I want, th – all the things that – all – the only thing that I always heard from my aunt was that my mother was the most ele-elegant person in Warsaw, but that didn't give me anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: I know about my father that he was in the Polish army.</span> <span id="s46">And he won the, what they call Virtuti Militari, which was the highest rank, highest award that been given to soldiers.</span> <span id="s47">And I also know that never been given to a Jew.</span> <span id="s48">So, he was the only Jew who got this award.</span> <span id="s49">And I have it, I – I go – we got it through the internet from the Polish army museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: That’s quite amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: Do you remember any – did you remember what your first language was, do you –</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: It was Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: But when I arrived to Israel, to Palestine at the time, it was a mixture of German and Polish and I don’t know what.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: So tell me, do you have any early memories of Warsaw at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: The only one memory I have is that – I think we were very, very young age, that I am in a pram, in a baby carriage, with my father, in a – in a park.</span> <span id="s58">And it was snowing, wintertime, and I remember what – wearing this snowsuit, white snowsuit, with a – with thing for – they call it mufa in Polish, for the hand, from [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: It’s a muff, it’s a muff, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: Yeah, yeah, muff.</span> <span id="s61">And I was all in white, and I remember myself – I think that – I – I’m not sure whether that’s real, but that’s what I remember, lying in a – in baby pram with my father in the park.</span> <span id="s62">This is the early –</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: And is your f – do you have any memory of how – what he looked like?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: I just think – I don’t know if – because I saw his pictures, so I don’t know if it’s my memory, or what ha – from what I saw.</span> <span id="s65">But I – I remember somebody very tall, very tall and very beautiful.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: And your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: My mother I remember a little bit later, I think.</span> <span id="s68">My mother had dark hair.</span> <span id="s69">Both of them had black hair, I don’t know how I got my blonde hair.</span> <span id="s70">And – and actually, the first mo – memory of her is for – what I thought that it was the beginning of – beginning of the war.</span> <span id="s71">It was a – a day that I remember being in a house, and everything, all the doors were open, and i-it was plenty of movement on the street, and they’re shouting and shooting, and people running.</span> <span id="s72">And the – I remember hearing this gunshot, this boom, boom.</span> <span id="s73">And the – I saw my dog, I had the Lassie dog, on the floor with a hole in his head and something red was coming out and I remember myself – I remember me crawling to the dog.</span> <span id="s74">And then it was noise and the door bin – opened and the big soldier, he was a Ukraine –</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: How did you know that?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: – came in – I don’t know.</span> <span id="s77">I don’t know how – how I know.</span> <span id="s78">But I know I – I’m – I don’t know how I know that he was Ukraine.</span> <span id="s79">He was a big man.</span> <span id="s80">He lift me up into his arms.</span> <span id="s81">He had red cheeks, and a horrible smell of alcohol from his mouth, and my mother was screaming, and he was laughing and holding me in his arms, and laughing.</span> <span id="s82">That’s what I remember from them.</span> <span id="s83">Then the next thing I remember is being in a – quite a dark apartment.</span> <span id="s84">My mother was walking backward and forward in the room doing this, you know?</span> <span id="s85">And then I remember that it was a cupboard there, and my mother used to go into the cupboard.</span> <span id="s86">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: Did you go with her?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: No.</span> <span id="s89">I ler – I didn’t look Polish – I didn’t look Jewish, I think.</span> <span id="s90">I didn't go with her.</span> <span id="s91">She was always very ha – going into this cupboard, and then one day she disappeared.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: And, did your father disappear from your life by that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: Yes, at that time, and I th – I – somehow, I was making connection between my mother’s walking so the f – backward and forward in the room, and the – doing this with the – the – the disappearing of my father.</span> <span id="s94">I don’t know if it’s right or wrong, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: But that was what you think your impression was.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: That’s what my impression was.</span> <span id="s97">And then she disappeared, and I was there in this house.</span> <span id="s98">I don’t remember the people there.</span> <span id="s99">I just – somehow, again, I just know.</span> <span id="s100">And this is very strange thing, that I know things.</span> <span id="s101">I don’t know if I’ve been told, cause I didn’t have anybody to tell me about it, but I know that it – the – that was out of the ghetto, and I – I assume that my parents were – they didn’t – they didn’t really live very Jewish life, and they probably had a lot of friends.</span> <span id="s102">And my – my uncle was a musician, and he had probably his own artist fre – friends.</span> <span id="s103">So, I assume that that’s how we got out of the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: So you thi –</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: Or we’ve never been – I don’t think that we’ve been in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s106">I’m not sure, but I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: So this dark apartment, you don’t know where it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: Yeah, I don’t know where it was.</span> <span id="s109">I’m sure that it wasn’t in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s110">Somehow.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: Do you think that your mother might have disappeared because someone informed?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: I think that she’s captured, she been captured, because I know that sh – later on – later on she was in a labor camp.</span> <span id="s113">She was working.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: And your father just disappears?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: It was the end of my father, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: And you never knew what he did for a living?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: And –</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: Part of being in the army, which that we knew, I didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: And, you don’t know if, aside from your uncle, whether there were any other brothers and sisters that they had?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: No, there is a picture that they – because all these pictures been sent to me by my uncle, and that there is a picture that they are in some resort, and there is a picture of my father, my mother, that was before they got married.</span> <span id="s122">It was from – because there is a date, 1936.</span> <span id="s123">And it was my mother, my father, my uncle, and behind, it was written, Auntie Bronia(ph), but I don’t know who sister she was.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: So, who she was related to.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: Auntie Bronia(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: And your mother’s name was?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: Adela(ph)</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: Adela(ph).</span> <span id="s131">So it’s a mystery.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: It is.</span> <span id="s133">The whole thing is quite a mystery.</span> <span id="s134">I mean that the – the fact that the – all these years, nobody showed up, but they – they – they lived in a place, in a big city like Warsaw.</span> <span id="s135">They probably had friends or relatives, family.</span> <span id="s136">Nobody ever, except my uncle, nobody ever showed up.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: Well, from the pictures, they look very well-to-do.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: As if they came from a very upper class family.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: Yeah, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s141">But still.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: What – what’s the next memory that – that you have, that you can think of, that comes to m –</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: The next memory I have is that my mother is coming to take me from this house, from this apartment, and we are in a very crowded place in, it was probably the Hotel Polski in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s144">And then we’re in a little [indecipherable] train, very, very small place, and people were just next to each other, and it was very hard to breathe.</span> <span id="s145">And people were crying and screaming and it was – it was – and I was on my – in – on my mother’s arms.</span> <span id="s146">And then I remember that we got to a place, door were opened, and the – they took us out, you know, like a cattle.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: You remember this?</span> <span id="s148">You had this –</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: I remember this.</span> <span id="s150">I remember this.</span> <span id="s151">I remember they took us to showers, very cold showers.</span> <span id="s152">And were – and plenty of women together in this shower, and my mother put me on – on the floor, which was disgusting.</span> <span id="s153">It was cold, and the water – and wet and th – and then she picked me up.</span> <span id="s154">And then, when we got out of the showers, I was with her, and with a man.</span> <span id="s155">The story goes that my mother – that be – I been tell – told later, that it was this arrangement that the German maid with the Jewish authorities or something, that they will exchange people who had a certificate to Palestine for German people who lived in Israel – in Palestine, at that time.</span> <span id="s156">They were the T-Templers, tho – the big communit – German community in Palestine.</span> <span id="s157">And we know that some of them really adopted the Nazi i-ideas.</span> <span id="s158">And the Germans wanted to exchange them, I think.</span> <span id="s159">So they announce that the people who has certificate to Palestine will come to Hotel Polski, which was a hotel in Warsaw, and they will take to – take us to Palestine.</span> <span id="s160">My mother found this man who had the – on his papers there were, the woman and a child.</span> <span id="s161">But they weren’t exist any more.</span> <span id="s162">So she paid him, she gave him the – what she had.</span> <span id="s163">And we were with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: Do you have any memories of him?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: I have a – I – I don’t know, it’s a – it’s – whatever it’s – what – my memory about him is – is something wer – very frightening.</span> <span id="s166">Really frightening, he was a very frightening man to me, because he – later on we knew that he hit me and sort of abused me, not – not sexually, but he abused me.</span> <span id="s167">Because I – my mother been taken away.</span> <span id="s168">As we got out of those showers, my mother disappeared, and I left with the man.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: Oh, so you never saw her after that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: I saw her, they took me to see her, she was in the hospital.</span> <span id="s171">And I thought that there is a hospit – there was a hospital out of the camp, but I know now that it was a ho-hospital ou – inside the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: So where were you at this point, were you in Warsaw –</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: I was with this man –</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: And where was –</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: – and they put me in the man barrack.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: And, but where was the – where was this taking place?</span> <span id="s177">Hotel Polski in Warsaw, or was this –</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: No, Hotel Polski – we took us from Hotel Polski, put us on the trains, and we thought that this is the end of the – of the [indecipherable] and that we are going to Palestine.</span> <span id="s179">But instead they took us to Bergen-Belsen, the whole transport.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: So, in other words, whether you had a certificate or not, it didn’t matter.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: No, that what we had in Bergen-Belsen – I read about it.</span> <span id="s182">It was – we all considered to be the Palestinian Jew – Palestinians.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: And they put us together in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s185">But certainly they didn’t take us to Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: And they didn – and there was no exchange.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: There wasn’t any exchange.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: Wow, so your mother a-and this man, as terrifying as he was, both of them got fooled.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: Both of them thought that – that this was a ticket –</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: Yeah, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: – out, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: Together with very many other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: People, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: And so the – so, you remember seeing her in the hospital, do you remember –</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: Yeah, I remember that somebody took me, I don’t know who took me to see her.</span> <span id="s198">I saw her in the bed, and then they took me away.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: Did she say anything to you, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s201">I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: Do you remember anything of how she looked?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: Yes, I remember.</span> <span id="s204">She looked very much like – like in the pictures, with her make –</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: She looked beautiful.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s207">I think that she was a – that time she was very, very sick, because she died very soon after.</span> <span id="s208">She had TB, tuberculosis, so she died, and that’s why did – they didn’t let her to leave with all the others, they left her there.</span> <span id="s209">And they next thing I remember was I was on the top bed.</span> <span id="s210">You know they had those beds, with – and I was on top bed in this barrack and there were other people there, about three people, or – few people left in the barrack during the day, and I heard them talking.</span> <span id="s211">And I heard that they said something like, poor child, her mother died.</span> <span id="s212">Something like that.</span> <span id="s213">In the same time, when they –</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: The men then, it must have been the men.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: Yeah, but they were talking between –</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: Themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: – themselves.</span> <span id="s218">And I heard somebody humming.</span> <span id="s219">So, always this kind of music and bad news.</span> <span id="s220">Well –</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: Was it a sad kind of melody, or was it a –</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: I – I thought it sad s – I think it was a sad – it was a melody, I don’t know, it was just – and that’s came together with what they said, and I was lying there in the bed and listening to this.</span> <span id="s223">They probably didn’t think that I’m listening, or didn’t consider me listening.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: Were there other children in that barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: No, there was only me.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: It’s so unusual –</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: Yeah, it was –</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: – to think that there’s a little girl in the men’s barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s230">And what we know from other testimonies and the stories that the women in the women barrack told – told us that they – they saw that this man is really very hard on me, and then decided to take me away from him.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: Well, in what way – first, let’s go back to some of those memories of – of this man and – and in what way was he terrifying?</span> <span id="s232">Do you have any –</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: He hits me.</span> <span id="s234">I – I remember.</span> <span id="s235">I remember –</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: You remember being hit?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: – me crying, yeah.</span> <span id="s238">I remember he hit me.</span> <span id="s239">I was – I was on the top bed, I couldn’t – I don’t know if I – if I walked at the time, or not, but I – I couldn’t hold my – my pee-pee and [indecipherable] and I probably did the whole thing in the bed, and he hit me.</span> <span id="s240">And I remember.</span> <span id="s241">I remember that was terrifying.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: Now, was he in the same bunk as you were, or was he in the next one underneath?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: Next one underneath.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: Underneath.</span> <span id="s245">So you were in the top, and he was the next –</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: Did you have a name for him?</span></p>

id="s255">And they gave it to him and they took me.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: Do you remember that?</span> <span id="s257">Being taken by them?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: I remember mi –

<span id="s270">I was neglected and dirty and crying all the time and she said that she had to – to clean me up.</span> <span id="s271">She stood out there in the snow, and I was full of lice.</span> <span id="s272">She said that she had to cut my hair [indecipherable] have real scissors, but whatever she had.</span> <span id="s273">She – she said, you had beautiful golden curls, and I was standing in the – in the snow cutting every curl, and with every curl which been dropped on the snow, I cried, you see.</span> <span id="s274">She said, where is your blonde girl – curls now?</span> <span id="s275">Anyway, where are they?</span> <span id="s276">And then she said that she was telling me stories.</span> <span id="s277">She was telling me about re – Little Red Riding Hood, was wal-walking this – in the forest, picking flowers, and I ask her what – what is flower?</span> <span id="s278">And she told me that she taught me how to eat properly, not like – you know, like a lady.</span> <span id="s279">How to – and she used to – I – I wa – this – later ons, there is some s – I don’t know if this from that time or some other time, but she used to cut a piece of bread for – you know, a piece of st – she want – eat like a beast, that like – only eat like – eat like a lady.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: Do you know what language you spoke to her in?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: Ah, so even though she had French papers, she spoke Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: No, she wasn’t French, she studied in France, she was Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: Uh-huh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: And then she said – she told me that she – I started to walk, and she didn’t want me to have bad shoes, because I will ruin my legs.</span> <span id="s286">So she sneaked into the shoes barrack to find me shoes.</span> <span id="s287">Which I think that it was, you know, it was re-real dangerous thing to do.</span> <span id="s288">And she found me a pair of shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: What I’m amazed by is that a little girl is allowed to live at all in bu – in –</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: Bergen –</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: – Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s292">Now what – how was it – were you hidden from the German authorities, do you think?</span> <span id="s293">Did they know about your existence?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: I don’t know, but I know that I didn’t have a bed for myself in the women’s barrack.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: I always slept with someone before, but probably in the beginning it was with Bronka(ph), and later on with somebody else.</span> <span id="s297">And then she said, when she had to be transferred, and she had to be taken away, she said on that day, she said – she said that she never – she didn’t talk about it, because she didn’t want me to hear about it.</span> <span id="s298">Somehow probably, I heard.</span> <span id="s299">And – and that day, when she went – taken, she wanted to say goodbye to me and I dis – just disappeared.</span> <span id="s300">And she looked for me, but she didn’t have enough time.</span> <span id="s301">And then when she was on the other side of the gate, suddenly she heard this scream, and she saw me running to the gate.</span> <span id="s302">And I gave her something.</span> <span id="s303">She – I put something in her hand.</span> <span id="s304">She put it in he-her pocket.</span> <span id="s305">And then she said, you know, you saved my life.</span> <span id="s306">What happened was, that –</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: Let’s hold onto this thought –</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: – for when the tape changes, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: Okay, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s312">And it – one is coming out and another one is going in.</span> <span id="s313">I’m keeping the audio running so that nothing is interrupted at all.</span> <span id="s314">Okay, and let me say, this is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Lily Cohen.</span> <span id="s315">And you were at the point where you were going to tell us about Bronka(ph) and having her told you many years later, that you saved her life.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: That’s what she said.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: And there was something you gave her, so tell us about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: So, she said that, before she went away, the women and the camp wanted to pass some kind of news about themselves to the relatives, and they didn’t know that she is going to another camp, they thought that she’ll be li-liberated.</span> <span id="s319">And they sew in her coat, she – they sew names and addresses and the – and some information.</span> <span id="s320">And it was all been sewn to th – her coat.</span> <span id="s321">When she got into Vittel, they – they started to check – check on her.</span> <span id="s322">They started with her shoes, they told her to – to open her shoes.</span> <span id="s323">And they gone up, and she was – she said, I was so white, I knew that this is my e – the end of me.</span> <span id="s324">And they said, okay, take everything out of your pocket.</span> <span id="s325">And it was a little statue of Maria and the – and the baby.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: Of the Virgin Mary and the baby.</span> <span id="s327">And that’s what you had given her.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s329">So sh – th-the guard said, okay, that’s all right, we are not that bad, we are not, you know – so she said, and that saved my life.</span> <span id="s330">And I saw this Virgin Mary with a baby later on in life, she kept it.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: And do you remember it, or you don’t have a memory of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: No, I don’t have memory.</span> <span id="s333">I remember many things from the camp, but I don’t remember Bronka(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: And you don’t remember the little statue, and where you would have gotten it?</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: I don’t even, no, I don’t remember anything of th – her stories.</span> <span id="s336">Was like – it is like a black hole.</span> <span id="s337">And I tried so much to remember.</span> <span id="s338">I didn’t manage it.</span> <span id="s339">I thought that maybe that was the only good time that I have there, so it just –</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: What do you – what – do you ha – do you ha – you said you had other memories, many other memories?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: I have other memories.</span> <span id="s342">I don’t remember the women who took care of me.</span> <span id="s343">I knew – I know that there were many women who took turns to take care of me.</span> <span id="s344">I don’t remember their faces.</span> <span id="s345">I just knew – know that they were exist.</span> <span id="s346">I – but I do remember that it was a camp just next to ours.</span> <span id="s347">And I remember nights, and people are standin – men standing there with those traps.</span> <span id="s348">And – and the little hats, and they were always screaming and shouting and crying from that camp.</span> <span id="s349">And I was so afraid to go out night to do my things.</span> <span id="s350">And ev – I remember this very, very vivid, I remember this –</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: Were there other children in the women’s barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: It was – there were two.</span> <span id="s353">It was the girl, and it was another boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: Were they about your age, or were they older?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: They – they were older.</span> <span id="s356">They were older.</span> <span id="s357">And th – they were with their mother.</span> <span id="s358">One of them, that I heard – I learned later on, she was adopted by the – by this woman, because her child was dead, and again, the papers.</span> <span id="s359">So she took a girl, and she just her – her son name was Avraham, she put Avrahama.</span> <span id="s360">And that was the girl.</span> <span id="s361">And she brought this girl to Israel.</span> <span id="s362">And this girl, I – I never met her, but I met the woman, because she was visiting me on a regular basic – later on in Israel.</span> <span id="s363">So I kept in touch with her til the – her last – last day.</span> <span id="s364">And I – I remember – what I remember from the camp and all this time I – all my memories are in black and white.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: How odd.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: They’re all in black and white.</span> <span id="s367">Only when we got – when we were liberated by the Americans, after the train, which I’ll tell about it, and we got to this place which called [indecipherable] this when my movie starting in colors.</span> <span id="s368">So, the first time that I remember colors.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: But it’s – I find it amazing that you – we don’t have dates for it, but it sounds as if your beginning of darkness happens fairly soon after the war breaks out.</span> <span id="s370">That – that your mother and yourself are in a – in a – an apartment where she has to go into the cupboard, and then you’re in Hotel Polski, and then you have a train to Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s371">What year could have this been, and the – the th – the other thing is, is that you must have been a small child as – a small baby anyway when you were in Bergen-Belsen –</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: – you know.</span> <span id="s374">So, in some ways it’s a miracle that – in many ways it’s a miracle that you survived the entire war incarcerated, whereas most children would not have survived.</span> <span id="s375">They would have been found, discovered, gotten rid of.</span> <span id="s376">Because, how much could they work, you know, and what was their value?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s378">The only thing is the – that the children that were – and now I learned about it more and more, the only children that were surv – is survive the – all of them were with some relatives, either aunt, uncle, parents, one of the parents.</span> <span id="s379">I was the only one who didn’t have anybody.</span> <span id="s380">I cannot say that I – I came with – I didn’t come with anybody.</span> <span id="s381">Even the woman that, when we being taken out of Bergen-Belsen to – it was April – no, well, before April, it was the March ’45.</span> <span id="s382">I was with one of the women, but she was killed on the train.</span> <span id="s383">So again, I – I left alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: Do you remember her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: No, I don’t remember [indecipherable] face.</span> <span id="s386">I just – I remember one face, I have this face in front of me, it was laughing and had those dimples [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s387">But –</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: You don’t know whose it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: By the time 1945 rolls around, it looks as if, from the documents you have, that it – you’re at least seven years old, something like that.</span> <span id="s391">And a seven year old already can have certain memories –</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: So that’s what’s really – really amazed me.</span> <span id="s393">I know from one of the testimonies, one of the ladies, the – this woman who had the ba – the – the g – the girl, Nuta(ph) Gudkowski(ph), that she said that I was – she knows me from the – from the beginning.</span> <span id="s394">Well, she was with the pe-people in Hotel Polski, and came on the same train, and being in the same barrack.</span> <span id="s395">So she said that – that I was ol – four or five, and al – when we got out.</span> <span id="s396">So I don’t have any – again, I don’t know, I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s397">And I don’t have the memory o – I – now, when all this train story came up, and I hear stories of children who were 11 years old, and 10 year – no, 12 years old, they have a very vivid memory, and memory in order, you know, they can tell a story.</span> <span id="s398">I don’t feel that I can tell a story.</span> <span id="s399">I don’t have it, somehow.</span> <span id="s400">I have pictures, I have, you know, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: Images.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: Images.</span> <span id="s403">But I don’t have story.</span> <span id="s404">I get – I – I have more of a story when we – when we went out of – of Bergen-Belsen, I remember us walking this much, we walked about 10 kilometers.</span> <span id="s405">I remember that when we walked out, it was a kitchen on the other side of the – of the gate.</span> <span id="s406">And with a horrible smell, you know, the – with smell the – with the soup that they gave us was horrible, horrible smell.</span> <span id="s407">And I remember that somebody ran into the kitchen, somebody ra – from the [indecipherable] and he – and he’d been shot, and then somebody else ran into the kitchen, been shot as well.</span> <span id="s408">And my adopted mother said that I was telling her this story and I said to her that it was a very funny story, a very funny thing, cause we were walking and somebody ran there, and suddenly it was piff puff and the person fell on the ground.</span> <span id="s409">And there was another one, there was another piff puff, and the person fell on the ground.</span> <span id="s410">It was very fu-funny.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: Oh, a child, a child.</span> <span id="s412">So it’s – but you don’t remember telling this story, she is somebody who tells you about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: That – but I told – I – I remembered – I remembered the event.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: I don’t remember that I told them the story, but she remember it.</span> <span id="s416">And then I remember that there – I remember that [indecipherable] and there were times that there were many – there were German officers are picking me up on their arms.</span> <span id="s417">You know, probably I was a – you know, I was a blonde and blue eyes.</span> <span id="s418">Maybe that’s what saved me.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: So, obviously then, you weren't hidden.</span> <span id="s420">If German office –</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: No, I wasn’t – I –</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: – if German officers were picking you up –</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: – I wasn’t hidden, no.</span> <span id="s424">No, I wasn’t hidden, no.</span> <span id="s425">I just didn’t have my place, cause I always slept with somebody, but I – no, I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: Do you remember anything of how you spent the days?</span> <span id="s427">Do you think you played at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: You know what, I don’t remember conversations.</span> <span id="s429">I don’t remember people talking.</span> <span id="s430">I don’t – part of the one that I heard about my mother’s death, I don’t remember, I don’t remember people talking to me, or I talking to them.</span> <span id="s431">I don’t remember me talking.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: I had a thought as you were talking earlier, did you feel completely alone?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: I felt com – I felt co-completely alone all my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: That’s what my other question was going to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: All my life.</span> <span id="s436">I felt – of course, I had the love of my adopted family and the – but I always felt sort of floating, no [indecipherable] like – like alone in the world.</span> <span id="s437">I always felt like no – this is my – my biggest memory and my biggest feeling, being alone.</span> <span id="s438">At the same token, I knew that I have only me for myself, and then – that I have to rel-rely on myself.</span> <span id="s439">It’s th – there’s no trust.</span> <span id="s440">I couldn’t trust, especially [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s441">Never trusted them.</span> <span id="s442">When I came to the kibbutz, and th – in my kibbutz [indecipherable] they all speak he – Polish, and they all tried very hard to make me forget Polish.</span> <span id="s443">And I, again I was lying in the bed listening to two women speak in Polish.</span> <span id="s444">And they were talking about how wonderfully – wonderfully I been, you know, recovered, and – and I was thinking to myself, they don’t know.</span> <span id="s445">I have a secret, and I’m not going to tell the secret to anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: What was your secret?</span> <span id="s447">A: My life in different place, that I don’t – I know that I live there, I knew that I was there.</span> <span id="s448">I knew that all the things that I – all the – my memories were exist.</span> <span id="s449">But I didn’t want to – to tell them.</span> <span id="s450">I felt that I better keep it to myself.</span> <span id="s451">And later on I – I thought that that will be – that was my strategy to how – somehow to assimilate and to survive.</span> <span id="s452">Because I came to a place that there were children with the mothers and fathers and they look so healthy and so nice.</span> <span id="s453">All the things that I wanted to be, and I wasn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: You mentioned having an adopted mother –</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: – later on, but let’s go back in our – to the chronology of when you’re leaving Bergen-Belsen –</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: The camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: – and you’re on the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: Yeah, we were, again, on the train.</span> <span id="s460">I remember being with someone, and I remember that we weren’t ri – we were riding this train, again very many, sort of – you know, many people sitting together, and there was smells.</span> <span id="s461">I remember smell.</span> <span id="s462">And – and tha – then I remember hearing booming and shooting and then the train stopped.</span> <span id="s463">And we went under the train.</span> <span id="s464">There was shooting.</span> <span id="s465">We ran –</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: Was it open train?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: – with the woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: It was an open – no roof on it?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: No, it was a roof – the train was partly cattle cars and partly passengers car.</span> <span id="s470">And probably we were in the cattle car, because it was very – too cozy.</span> <span id="s471">And there were shooting and the train stopped, and we ran after – down to – underneath the train, and then I looked at this woman next to me, and she didn't move.</span> <span id="s472">She was dead.</span> <span id="s473">So, that was –</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: Who was doing the shooting, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: The German.</span> <span id="s476">They wanted to bomb this train.</span> <span id="s477">Their plan was, initially, to get rid of the plane, to bomb it.</span> <span id="s478">And one of their cars were full of explosions.</span> <span id="s479">So, what happened in the train, that the – this train, for a week was riding backward and forward, many of the railroads were bombed, so they had to go back.</span> <span id="s480">And on the way they picked up more workers from labor camps, so the train was full of Polish people from Bergen-Belsen and Hungarians and Finnish and all kind of people that they found.</span> <span id="s481">Were 2500 people on the train.</span> <span id="s482">And th – in the end the pr – the train stopped near a city called Magedburg(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: Magdeburg, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s485">And now, I remember that it was a – a train, and it was a hill here, and I saw there a German running away, running, escaping.</span> <span id="s486">And again somebody, some young soldier came back and said, oh, don’t blame us, we’re not all the same, and run away.</span> <span id="s487">And we s-stayed there.</span> <span id="s488">This woman next to me was dead, I was under the train.</span> <span id="s489">And then came the Americans.</span> <span id="s490">They were all chewing chewing gum.</span> <span id="s491">So they –</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: So they liberated you from under a train.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: They – yeah, so I got out of the tra-train – from under the train and they came, and I ye – I don’t remember if – but I know now that in the beginning it was one tank with two s-soldiers.</span> <span id="s494">And then they – they went and they brought others, because what they saw there wasn’t very nice.</span> <span id="s495">There were plenty of people dy-dying and dead.</span> <span id="s496">They took pictures, there are pictures from that site.</span> <span id="s497">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: And you’ve seen those?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: I don’t – I do-don’t see myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s501">But when you see the pictures, have you recognized some memory?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: I re – yes, very much so, because for years I – I always, in my memory it always was a hill.</span> <span id="s503">And then I saw pictures of this train, probably from the other side, which was a plateau.</span> <span id="s504">And I thought maybe it was, you know, my memory and it’s not as accurate.</span> <span id="s505">But when I saw the pictures now, I saw that it was exactly how I remember it.</span> <span id="s506">And now the – the American came and they gave us – they – I remember plenty of – of – sort of – plenty of joy.</span> <span id="s507">And they gave us something very, very nice and sweet.</span> <span id="s508">Was chocolate.</span> <span id="s509">Which I never had before.</span> <span id="s510">And then they took us – now, I remember they took us to another camp, which was Buchenwald, and I remembered it was Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s511">I remember myself now alone, standing in the – in the line for food, you know, and walking there.</span> <span id="s512">And then they evacuated, they took the pla – th-the people and they put them to pi – two places, Fursleben(ph) and Hillersleben.</span> <span id="s513">And nobody took me, so they all left the camp, and I had my little doll that Bronka(ph) made me, which at that time I think that was leg missing, hand missing, whatever.</span> <span id="s514">And I was sitting with this little doll, alone.</span> <span id="s515">The whole place was empty.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: This is Buchenwald, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: Buchenwald, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: And – and then it was a woman came back, with her son.</span> <span id="s520">She said because they all – they had trucks and all kind of vehicles, and she came back.</span> <span id="s521">She came back for me.</span> <span id="s522">She said, give – give hand to Tommy and come with us.</span> <span id="s523">And I didn’t want to.</span> <span id="s524">I wanted to stay.</span> <span id="s525">I was talk – this time I was remem – I remember I was talking to my doll.</span> <span id="s526">I was telling her that when everyone left, I was telling her that she shouldn’t be afraid, because I am with her and I am taking care of her.</span> <span id="s527">So then the – this lady said, okay, again she ha – give hand to Tommy and come with us.</span> <span id="s528">Tommy was her son.</span> <span id="s529">I said, well, I can go by myself.</span> <span id="s530">And I went with them.</span> <span id="s531">I didn’t give hand to Tommy.</span> <span id="s532">And I went with them, and we were taken to Hillersleben.</span> <span id="s533">And was a beautiful, beautiful place.</span> <span id="s534">I remember sunshine and be – remember little white houses, beautiful streets, and bougava – bougainvillea, which was – it was a –</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: So, it was a town, or it was –</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: It was a town.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: Town, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: It was a town that the families of the aviation forces lived.</span> <span id="s539">And we got the house there.</span> <span id="s540">I was with the Hilde Huppert, it was the name of the lady, and her son, Tommy.</span> <span id="s541">And the – oh, the flowers, that bougainvillea, that was the purple bougainvillea.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: So you saw your first flowers.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: This was – I saw my flir – yeah, first flowers.</span> <span id="s544">The second time I saw this – this exactly flowers, the wa – purple bougainvillea, it was in – in another war.</span> <span id="s545">In the Independent war, in Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s546">So, I remember – I remember getting into this house, and they had bed with sh-sheets, white sheets.</span> <span id="s547">I never seen white sheets in my life.</span> <span id="s548">And Hilde Huppert put us in the bath, she put me in the bath.</span> <span id="s549">And it was warm, and nice, and it wasn’t cold any more.</span> <span id="s550">It was very, very nice, I didn’t want to get out.</span> <span id="s551">And – and she put me in the bed.</span> <span id="s552">In the beginning I was with my clothes, I wanted to go on the bed, and she said, no, no, you c – you’re not allowed with clothes on bed.</span> <span id="s553">So that was a nice time there.</span> <span id="s554">I don’t know how long we were –</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: Who was she?</span> <span id="s556">Who was this lady?</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: She was – she was one of those Palestinians.</span> <span id="s558">Her husband had the [indecipherable] send them the Palestinians papers, the certificate.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: So he was – she was a – a Jew from Poland, or from –</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: No, she was a Jew from Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: She [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: And she had had those – she had those certificates.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: Yes, all our barrack had the certificate.</span> <span id="s565">And some of them, like Nuta(ph) Gudkowski(ph), the one with – with the girl, her husband also – they managed to run away because the – the German in the beginning, they – they were after the men.</span> <span id="s566">So some of the men managed to escape, and they – some of them escaped to Palestine.</span> <span id="s567">And that’s how they send us the – the papers.</span> <span id="s568">So, I remember – at that time I rem – I remember Tommy was teasing me all the time.</span> <span id="s569">He said, you don’t have pa – father, you don’t have mother, I have a father in Palestine and wa – we will see him, we go there.</span> <span id="s570">And I said, I don’t care.</span> <span id="s571">And – and then we – I don’t know how long we were in Hillersleben, but it was a beautiful place, a nice place.</span> <span id="s572">Somehow I had the feeling, I’m not sure because I didn’t – Hilde Huppert wrote a book, “Hand in Hand with Tommy.”</span> <span id="s573">And I don’t remember that she mentioned it, but th – it is in my memory that she wanted Tommy to learn English.</span> <span id="s574">And she – she had someone and I was just sitting and listening to this.</span> <span id="s575">But again, I don’t know cause I – it haven’t been mentioned and I didn’t ask her about it.</span> <span id="s576">But I – if I remember this, probably it was right.</span> <span id="s577">And then Hilde Huppert arranged – she met a Jewish rabbi in the American Army.</span> <span id="s578">Her name was Neueman(ph).</span> <span id="s579">And she arranged for a children transport to Palestine.</span> <span id="s580">Somehow they managed to – to find children who were from the age of six, seven, five and 20, they’re all children, and they took us there, it was a big transport, and th – we got to Paris.</span> <span id="s581">I remember –</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: But Tony wasn’t in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: Tommy was with us, I was with her, and with Tommy.</span> <span id="s584">I was very much next to her, and we all went to Paris, and I remember the Eiffel Tower.</span> <span id="s585">We wen – been taken to Hotel Lutetia, which was a – still is the hotel in Paris.</span> <span id="s586">At that time it was a – the hotel that they brought refugees.</span> <span id="s587">And then I – no, I remember that we been taken to a beautiful place, it was in the country.</span> <span id="s588">And we were there for three weeks, it was some kind of rehabilitation place, you know, cause the – it was a river there, or a lake, and we were there, and it was very, very nice.</span> <span id="s589">And then we got on the ship, and we taken to Palestine.</span> <span id="s590">And we arrived in Palestine in the six, I think, sixth of July, 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: Did you play with other children on that ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: No, I don’t remember myself playing with anybody.</span> <span id="s593">I was with Tommy –</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: Did you play with Tommy?</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: Sort of.</span> <span id="s596">Tommy was a – sort of.</span> <span id="s597">I di – I don’t – I remember not – not liking him because he was teasing me all the time.</span> <span id="s598">And – but I was very, very attached to Hilde Huppert, felt very close to her, and she was very, very nice.</span> <span id="s599">Very nice lady.</span> <span id="s600">She took care of me.</span> <span id="s601">But when we arrived in Palestine, we arrived into another camp, which was [indecipherable] camp with – now there were other soldiers, different uniform, but that was a camp, with the barbed wire, with the barracks.</span> <span id="s602">At that time Hilde and Tommy, I remember stand – coming there, and I was with them, and it was a tall man standing on the other side, and they went with him.</span> <span id="s603">Tommy said, this is my father.</span> <span id="s604">And to – and we went with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: Oh, so you went with them, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: The – no, they went – they went with him, and I left in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q: What a terrible feeling that must have been.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: Was very terrible.</span> <span id="s609">But I already knew that I am – I’m on my own.</span> <span id="s610">Even when I was with Hilde Huppert, and even when – when I was with the children.</span> <span id="s611">That – maybe that I don’t remember them because I didn’t really develop relationship with them.</span> <span id="s612">I remember the first night in Atleet(ph).</span> <span id="s613">They gave us what we thought that they are Israeli – Israeli clothes.</span> <span id="s614">Shorts and khaki shirts, and I remember lying in bed, and this was near Haifa, and seeing all the lights going by and was thinking that it’s an – it’s another place, it’s a new place.</span> <span id="s615">So that – that was – I don’t know how long I was in Atleet(ph).</span> <span id="s616">I –</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s618">We’ll – time for a new – new tape, okay.</span> <span id="s619">We’ll wait a little bit, and have a change.</span> <span id="s620">[tape break] Okay, so why don’t we continue talking.</span> <span id="s621">This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Lily Cohen, and you are telling me about Haifa, and your first night in the new camp.</span> <span id="s622">Who are the soldiers who are surrounding it?</span> <span id="s623">What – what were the uniforms they were wearing?</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: Oh, th – the shorts.</span> <span id="s625">The British soldiers, they have knee socks, knee-high socks.</span> <span id="s626">And di-different – different hats.</span> <span id="s627">They didn’t look so frightening like the German.</span> <span id="s628">But they were soldiers, it was a camp.</span> <span id="s629">It was a line to food, and – and it was a barb wire, so it was a camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: It’s – it’s something in your – in the sequence of events, that it sounds like there were people who were watching out for you, but it was all episodic.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: It was not some thread of – for example, a child alone in a camp like this, I would think there has to be somebody who was responsible for the children who are alone in a camp like this, that the child then, you know, goes to.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: And it’s just hard to imagine that there you are, a little child in a camp, and there isn’t anyone in charge of the children who – whom –</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s636">I know from Hilde Huppert’s book that she said when she saw me sitting there alone, she said, ah this is – tha-that was Lily, the girl, she was on her own, and we knew that she was walking around, we just saw her always alone.</span> <span id="s637">So, I don’t think that anybody was in charge of me, except of the women who took care of me at the time.</span> <span id="s638">But they all disappeared, for many reasons.</span> <span id="s639">Probably some of them died, or I don’t know, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: And is there a reason why Lily – why Huppert –</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: Bronk -- Bronka(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: No, no, no, no, the one with Tommy, what’s her name again?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: Hilde.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: Hilde.</span> <span id="s645">Why you didn’t go with them?</span> <span id="s646">They were not –</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: Hilde Huppert was in that – in Bergen-Belsen, and – but she was in different barrack.</span> <span id="s648">She didn’t know me from Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s649">She just met me –</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: – after the train and – and – you know.</span> <span id="s652">She didn’t know me.</span> <span id="s653">She went – she saw me there, then she reme – she saw me that she said, this is the girl who was always –</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: Alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: – on her own, alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: But she didn't know me from before.</span> <span id="s658">I don’t know how exactly this camp was, but they – I’m not sure that they will – they wer – it was big enough that they didn’t know each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: No, I mean when you got to Palestine –</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: – was there a reason why they didn’t take you there, with the family?</span> <span id="s662">Did that cross your mind at the time, how come they’re not taking me?</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: No, no, because I – I didn’t trust – although I was with her, and although I got really attached to her at the time, but I knew already that there is no n – adult person that I should trust, that I am on – I am on my own.</span> <span id="s664">So, that happened before, that happened so many times during all these years in Bergen-Belsen, which people came and go and – in my life.</span> <span id="s665">So, I don’t – I don’t think that I should – I should have trust anybody.</span> <span id="s666">Wasn’t any trust on my part.</span> <span id="s667">I knew that there – I – I have to take care of myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: Were you ever adopted?</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: I was adopted, not officially, but I was adopted by the family in Palestine and Israel.</span> <span id="s670">And again, when the [indecipherable] was in a kibbutz, Ma’ale Hamisha(ph) of Jerusalem, their mother, her name is Badana(ph) said to me, you know, you don’t – you don’t call me mother.</span> <span id="s671">Don’t you call me mother, you had a mother, and you should remember her.</span> <span id="s672">I don’t know, it probably should be something very [indecipherable] educationally, but I do – I’m not sure that it was the right thing to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: Yeah, I would agree, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">A: So, but that was what – that was what – what she said, what happened, and I never called her mother.</span> <span id="s675">I – I’ve really fell in love with – she already had a – a year and a half older son than me, and two weeks baby, two weeks old baby.</span> <span id="s676">And she wanted to adopt a kid from the Holocaust because – for the memory of her family, which been perished in the war.</span> <span id="s677">And I didn’t feel that – that she is my mother.</span> <span id="s678">I – I was in love with my father – with the father, but maybe they weren’t my – my parents, but the children were my brothers.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: Were they?</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: Yeah, they are my brothers, to this ver-very day.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q: So, I’ve skipped a bit in asking you about that.</span> <span id="s684">Let’s try and get the chronology in the ne – back.</span> <span id="s685">When we’re back in Haifa and you’re in this camp, what happens to you after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: What happened was that I was there alone, and there was a woman who works for Aliyah Tenora(ph), which was the youth – and –</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: A youth organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: The youth organization, Aliyah Tenora(ph).</span> <span id="s689">And she came, and she said, I’m taking you to a family wants to be your family.</span> <span id="s690">And she took me.</span> <span id="s691">She lived in a kibbutz next to a kibbutz they lived, and she took me there.</span> <span id="s692">And I remember the road to the – to – all the road to Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s693">And it was funny because not long after, it was the ’48 war that was there.</span> <span id="s694">And th-the – and it wasn’t the same road.</span> <span id="s695">And I was always thinking, was it my memory that – that I saw this hills, and this mountains?</span> <span id="s696">Which from the side, and I never see them again.</span> <span id="s697">But when, after the ’67 war, when they opened this road again, there it was, exactly wa –</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: As your memory.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: – as my memory.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q: So, it also sounds like another thread is that your memory has not tricked you.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: In the things that you have remembered –</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: There were –</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: – you’ve been able to find ways to confirm those memories.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: Yes, yes, very much so.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: Have there been any memories that you were – had the opposite results, where you thought you remembered –</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: No, no –</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: – everything that I remember, and I checked – I checked up about the holo – the – the hospital in Bergen-Belsen, and I learned that it was a hospital.</span> <span id="s710">Because in the beginning they said to me there wasn’t any hospital, and I remember that my mother was in the hospital.</span> <span id="s711">And I remember – I remember the camp.</span> <span id="s712">I don’t remember – I remember – I remember the – the light inside the barrack.</span> <span id="s713">I remember the – the blankets.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: Tell us, what kind of significance do these memories have for you?</span> <span id="s715">What kind –</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: Fear.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: Fear?</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: Cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q: Oh, that’s what you remember from them, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">A: I remember and I – I – I think that I – I – I’m very, very sensitive to cold, to this very day.</span> <span id="s721">And I’m sure that it’s come from there.</span> <span id="s722">I remember this wet, cold floor.</span> <span id="s723">And – and I remember – yeah, I remember a lot of fear.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: It sounds though, that your memories are – how shall I put it?</span> <span id="s725">Because I don’t want to be suggestive if this is not true, that in some ways that your memories are both something you could trust – of all the things that you couldn’t trust, the memories that you had, you found out you could.</span> <span id="s726">And that they were the avenue to who you are.</span> <span id="s727">Is that so, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: Probably, probably yeah.</span> <span id="s729">Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s730">Because when I got into the kibbutz, and I – I remember the first day.</span> <span id="s731">They put me with the other children and we all had supper.</span> <span id="s732">And they all looked so different.</span> <span id="s733">And I didn’t speak the language.</span> <span id="s734">And I remember that somehow a – and though I was so different, I don’t remember that – it was something in that – in my present that children didn’t laugh at me.</span> <span id="s735">And the first night – night, and then few nights later, they used to – to give me this treatment for the lice.</span> <span id="s736">And that was with this kerosene oil, you know, they – they used to wash your head, and then –</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: Wrap it.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: – wrap it up, and the horrible smell.</span> <span id="s739">And with the – with the other chil – other three girls in the same room, and it was really very humiliating, night after night after night.</span> <span id="s740">And somehow, I don’t know, I didn’t – I don’t know what did I do, or how I fel – I was presented myself.</span> <span id="s741">But it wasn’t a laugh, it wasn’t a mockery.</span> <span id="s742">And I always – I wanted very much to be like them, of course.</span> <span id="s743">I wanted to be – I wanted to have dark hair, I wanted to have freckles.</span> <span id="s744">I wanted to – to speak that – like them.</span> <span id="s745">But after a very short while I understand – I understood that I won’t be like them, ever.</span> <span id="s746">I had this straight, blonde hair, and a – a white face, and a – and I remember myself making decision.</span> <span id="s747">I remember like always lying in the bed thinking to myself, all right, so if I’m not – if I am different, I will be different.</span> <span id="s748">I will be different, it’s okay.</span> <span id="s749">And I was different.</span> <span id="s750">And I – I – I held myself differently.</span> <span id="s751">I didn’t let them – because I saw how there were other children who came, they were – they always came with the uncles and aunties and fa – parents to the kibbutz from the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s752">And they – they – I saw how they related to them, and I s – I know that th-they didn’t relate to me like that, cause I was a – like my – when my brother said, you are the queen.</span> <span id="s753">So that was – I – I had – I – I make decision.</span> <span id="s754">I remember myself making decision.</span> <span id="s755">Never – never f – be sort of, the girl from there – from the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s756">So, I think th-that in a way, my – my – my childhood, which was so deprived, was an engine to me growing up in different way.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s758">In the – was it in the kibbutz that you had this unofficial adopted family?</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: They were there, and then e – it were my two brothers.</span> <span id="s762">And then when I was 10, my young brother was born, and they were very much my family, very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: The father that you adored so much, did – wer – did he adore you back?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s765">I was the only g-girl, he had three boys.</span> <span id="s766">Oh yes, he adored me.</span> <span id="s767">And my mother, she was very, sort of, educational person.</span> <span id="s768">She was a teacher and a – always asked psychologists what to do, and she always used to say, Shlamic(ph), you destroying the kid.</span> <span id="s769">You spoiling the kid.</span> <span id="s770">Cause he used to bring me tea to bed when I came out – I went on holiday.</span> <span id="s771">Shlamic(ph) – and he was a – he was a wonderful man.</span> <span id="s772">He was self –</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: Did he feel t – did he feel like a father?</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: He feeled like a father.</span> <span id="s775">I don’t know what a father –</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: – should be, but he loved me very much, and yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: So, did you trust him?</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: Ver – yeah, I think I trusted him.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Q: But you didn’t trust her.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: I-I – I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s782">I learned I – there were very her – very tough times for both of us during the years.</span> <span id="s783">I think only when she got really old, and now we are in a wonderful relationship.</span> <span id="s784">But, on her 80th birthday – 90th birthday, I – I talked, and I said that, in spite everything, she was the only mother I know – I knew.</span> <span id="s785">So, she was my mother and she is my mother.</span> <span id="s786">I don’t call her my mother.</span> <span id="s787">I don’t call her my mother, but she ki – she is.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Q: Do you think she – do you think she said this in a clumsy way, i-in that she wanted to be your mother, but she also wanted to honor the one that you had lost?</span></p> <p><span id="s789">A: I think that she want – wanted me to honored my mother, my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">A: She wanted me to remember them and honor them, that’s what I think.</span> <span id="s792">It wasn’t clumsy.</span> <span id="s793">She doesn’t do anything clumsy.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s795">By – by that I meant that, in a way, her saying it that way almost was, I’m not going to be a mother to you, I don’t want to do that.</span> <span id="s796">And every child needs a mother.</span> <span id="s797">So, it – it could be that – that – I guess what I’m asking is, despite such a statement and it – what it sounds like, a complex ties, did you feel that she wanted to be your mother, even with not the name?</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A: I – I think that – I think that she wanted to be.</span> <span id="s799">I don’t know if she wanted to be my mother.</span> <span id="s800">I think that she – she is a very moral person.</span> <span id="s801">She – she’s a very beautiful person, and I think that she wanted to pay respect to – to the family that perished.</span> <span id="s802">And I think that – that I was – I think that – that she – I think that she wanted to – I was symbolizing for her something much bigger than me.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: S-So – and she also wanted me to remember that I had a family.</span> <span id="s805">She didn’t want me to forget it.</span> <span id="s806">And that’s was her main – main reason –</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Q: That’s so diff – you know, that’s so very different than many adoptive parents.</span> <span id="s808">Many people who adopt children don’t want their ado – their – their children to remember the former family.</span> <span id="s809">They want them to become more integrated, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: So on the a – one – one side, she wanted me, because that – that’s why I don’t speak Polish this day.</span> <span id="s811">They never spoke Polish to me.</span> <span id="s812">And she said in the beginning I [indecipherable] Polish – I spoke Polish, but very di – very quickly, I really forgot it.</span> <span id="s813">On the other hand, I think that she, because she has such a family duty, and her family is a very, very [indecipherable] very famous family in Israel.</span> <span id="s814">And so – so the f – upper class of the Jewish families, her family is, is I think that together with this, she respected family.</span> <span id="s815">She didn’t want me to forget that I had mother and father.</span> <span id="s816">I can understand it, I just don’t know if I could accept it at the time, but I can understand it.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s818">In what way are your brother your real brothers?</span></p> <p><span id="s819">A: Oh, they are my brothers.</span> <span id="s820">They were always my brothers.</span> <span id="s821">Also, my mother, my adopted mother Anna, her husband, they were very – my mother is – was a very idealistic person.</span> <span id="s822">She worked for the others, she always had duties.</span> <span id="s823">She never was at home.</span> <span id="s824">Even for her own children, you know, it’s – it wasn’t any difference.</span> <span id="s825">And he was the head of – the kibbutz had a – a guest house, so he was the head of the guest house.</span> <span id="s826">And on my 70th, we – we celebrated my 70th birthday, what we thought it we – it is, just last October, and – and [indecipherable] December.</span> <span id="s827">And my brother got up and he said, we – we didn’t have parents, we only had each other.</span> <span id="s828">Said in front of her, in front of all the guests.</span> <span id="s829">It was a surprise fa – party.</span> <span id="s830">We only had each other, and I had the eldest sister.</span> <span id="s831">So yes, we were brothers.</span> <span id="s832">One of them was killed when he was 18 and a half.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Q: What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A: He was in the army, was in this commando unit, and got killed.</span> <span id="s835">And so we – we left, the two of them and me.</span> <span id="s836">And we are very, very much – very much attached to each other.</span> <span id="s837">So, it was a family.</span> <span id="s838">Their family, they have a very big fa-family.</span> <span id="s839">My mother – my adopted mother had a very – has a very big family.</span> <span id="s840">So there wa – I been accepted as a family, completely.</span> <span id="s841">And they – and so much so that they used to say that I look like my father.</span> <span id="s842">They were [indecipherable] oh, it show.</span> <span id="s843">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Q: And why is it you think that they didn’t want you to speak Polish?</span> <span id="s845">Do – were their – were their family roots from Poland –</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: They didn’t want me to – they didn’t want me to speak Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: I know.</span> <span id="s848">Why?</span> <span id="s849">Why, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s850">A: Because they – they thought at that time that it’s better to forget.</span> <span id="s851">I think that it was their idea of, for all the children that, you know, sort of start new life, and just erase what happened there.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Q: Were they also from Poland, or had they been in Palestine –</span></p> <p><span id="s853">A: They are in Poland, yeah, the ma – the kibbutz – the kibbutz mot – founders are all Polish.</span> <span id="s854">And few of them came – my adopted mother, her name is Badana(ph), the – the – her family had the school and kindergar – garten in Hebrew, in Lódz.</span> <span id="s855">So, their first language is Hebrew.</span> <span id="s856">And the – some of the people in the kibbutz, they were in the kindergarten and in the school.</span> <span id="s857">This is the Katznelson(ph) family which the Katznelson [indecipherable] family which was [indecipherable] very, sort of known family.</span> <span id="s858">So, they didn’t want, because that was their idea in that time.</span> <span id="s859">And there were very, very sad stories because of that.</span> <span id="s860">Nobody ask questions, nobody talked.</span> <span id="s861">We didn’t talk.</span> <span id="s862">Of course, I didn’t talk, because I want – I – I wanted to be like the rest, wanted just stories that I’m telling.</span> <span id="s863">And – and also, I was – I am – I – well, I remember very early in my life that I was thinking that I probably did something horrible, if that’s what happened to me.</span> <span id="s864">So, if I don’t have mother and father, and no – so, that was a thought that walked with me quite a long – many years in my childhood.</span> <span id="s865">Then, there were – people used to come to look for their relatives, the first years.</span> <span id="s866">And each time when they came, I was already – already was thinking that maybe one day, you know, the door will open and my mother will come in, or my father.</span> <span id="s867">And for years and years I used to daydream and night dream – no, night dream I was dreaming about horrible things and I was a – afraid of getting out of the – of the bed.</span> <span id="s868">Was quite awful, the night dreams.</span> <span id="s869">But during the day I used to daydream that they – they will come back.</span> <span id="s870">They will come for me.</span> <span id="s871">So all – each time when somebody came, you know, it was a new hope.</span> <span id="s872">But then Badana(ph) said, that’s it, stop.</span> <span id="s873">I don’t want it any more.</span> <span id="s874">And then, when my – when we heard from my uncle, I think that it was after the – no, it was before the war, before the ’48 war.</span> <span id="s875">He discovered me through Aliyah Tenora(ph), through the youth organization.</span> <span id="s876">And he started to write letters, and s – and send me all kind of beautiful clothes, because at that time we all had – all the children had clothes from people from America, from [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s877">Only me, I didn't have – also, I wouldn’t have because my adopted mother was a very idealistic person and she wouldn’t accept it, you know, that – but he did send me things, beautiful things.</span> <span id="s878">And also, Hilde Huppert used to come to visit me, and Nuta(ph) Gudkowski(ph), this lady with the child.</span> <span id="s879">She – they both used to come to visit me.</span> <span id="s880">And Hilde used to bring me all things that she was knitted, cause she was a very good knitter.</span> <span id="s881">And I have a picture of myself with the knitting sweater that she have.</span> <span id="s882">And so, in this sense, I – I felt okay with the other children.</span> <span id="s883">And then was the ’48 war, was another war.</span> <span id="s884">So from war to war, and the – again, I think that I was on my own.</span> <span id="s885">I was – I wa – not on my own at that time, because – but then a – was the kindergarten teacher, so she was with the other children.</span> <span id="s886">That what my brother meant when we were alone, with [indecipherable] parents.</span> <span id="s887">And I remember sitting on this truck with my six months old brother on my lap, when all the other mothers were sitting with their babies, with their children, and I was sitting with him.</span> <span id="s888">So, I was on my own.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">Q: When did your story – when did you start becoming interested in the story of your early years and your family?</span> <span id="s890">How did you start piecing it together?</span> <span id="s891">Clearly when your uncle wrote, that was a big thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">A: I didn't relate to it.</span> <span id="s893">I – I – I think that at that time, and many years later, I really wanted to detach myself from a – the whole thing.</span> <span id="s894">And so I knew that I couldn’t deny to myself that I was there, I didn’t want to be part of it.</span> <span id="s895">I read books, I saw films, but always sort of dissociation of that, you know, not being part of it, and I didn't want to talk about it.</span> <span id="s896">I never talked.</span> <span id="s897">I didn’t talk to my children.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">Q: When did you start talking about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s899">A: I start talking about it when my granddaughters were at school.</span> <span id="s900">I have twin granddaughters, my son children.</span> <span id="s901">And they did this work, you know, what they call root work, family.</span> <span id="s902">And I wrote to them.</span> <span id="s903">I wou – I decided that I – I will write to them.</span> <span id="s904">And I wrote to them, and telling them sort of in a children language, that I was bor – born in Poland, and I was in a camp.</span> <span id="s905">That was the first time that I really –</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q: How old were you, approximately?</span></p> <p><span id="s907">A: Approximately.</span> <span id="s908">Approximately tho – that was about 11 years ago, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">Q: So that’s very recent.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q: Very, very recent.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s914">Well, that’s not unusual.</span> <span id="s915">Many people don’t want to say things, don’t – aren’t ready until their children ask, or their grandchildren ask.</span> <span id="s916">And only then do they feel that it’s something that they’d like to share, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A: Yes, but with my children, to this very day, I don’t talk.</span> <span id="s918">I don’t think that they want to hear.</span> <span id="s919">I think that my s – my son has a big problem with it.</span> <span id="s920">I think that my son doesn’t want to talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">Q: Do you want to change the tape now?</span> <span id="s922">Okay, let’s do that.</span> <span id="s923">As we’re changing the tape, I can ask you this; why do you think he does?</span></p> <p><span id="s924">A: I don’t know, I think that – that somehow I missed the train.</span> <span id="s925">You know, maybe I – I had to talk about it – I had very special relationship with my son.</span> <span id="s926">I ga – gave birth to him when I was 18 and a half, and I probably grow – grew up with him.</span> <span id="s927">And I never wanted to [indecipherable] It’s okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Q: I got it.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A: I never felt – I never felt the right moment.</span> <span id="s930">What am I going to tell him, how?</span> <span id="s931">It – no, it – it didn't come.</span> <span id="s932">And he knew, but it was like he didn't know.</span> <span id="s933">I think that a few years la – a-ago, he said one day, he said, what your father di-did for a living?</span> <span id="s934">I said, I don’t know, I – I found out that he was a soldier, but no – no more than that.</span> <span id="s935">I didn’t want to – even now, when – he said, cause I went – we went to see [indecipherable] and then here, I said, well, have some fun, it’s – not everything is the Holocaust, you know?</span> <span id="s936">Immediately, he was sort of –</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: So, it – it – do you think that he thinks that you are so – that that’s all that goes on in your mind, and that that’s what rules you, in some ways?</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: No, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s939">I think that – that he – he – he wasn't part of me getting with the d – with the granddaughters.</span> <span id="s940">And one day I took the – my granddaughters to visit Hilde Huppert.</span> <span id="s941">I took him – I took – they came with their mother, not with him.</span> <span id="s942">He never met any of the people that were connected to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">Q: That’s so unusual.</span> <span id="s944">It sounds so unusual.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">A: Yeah, I thi – I – I don’t think – he has a big problem about it.</span> <span id="s946">I think it is a second – it’s like me, I wa – I am first and second generation because of the age, and he is a – quite a typical second generation in this sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Q: You’re ready?</span> <span id="s948">Okay, we can go.</span> <span id="s949">This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Lily Cohen.</span> <span id="s950">I’m trying to get a – when you became active to try and find out bits and pieces of your story, was it after you talked to y-your twins – grandchildren wanted it, and then you yourself became proactive?</span></p> <p><span id="s951">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q: Or was it even before, but you couldn’t find out things?</span></p> <p><span id="s953">A: Not much before.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">A: I think that I – I think the first time that I really suddenly was talking openly, it was to my friend Linda in – in Manhattan, it was this horrible restaurant, downtown man – Manhattan.</span> <span id="s956">And I think that I was talking to her because she was a stranger, she wasn’t anybody who was connected to me.</span> <span id="s957">Cause I really didn’t talk about it with people.</span> <span id="s958">Somehow I – I grew up and I was thinking to myself, okay, I can do – do thi – good things, I – I think that – the thing that I was very concerned about, only life that I have to be the best, th-the – the biggest, the – you know?</span> <span id="s959">I have to prove myself all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: Did you?</span> <span id="s961">Were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s962">A: Yeah, yeah I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: What did you –</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A: I don’t know if I was always the best, but I wanted to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s966">Well, what was your – how did you do it?</span> <span id="s967">What – in what ways did it show itself?</span></p> <p><span id="s968">A: It was some kind of, you know, competition with myself, you know?</span> <span id="s969">Oh, and I was that – I – I went to the music and dance academy, and I was looking at the girls who were dancing, and I said, if she can do it, I can do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">Q: And you did.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s972">That – but I – I do think that it was one of the things that I, since very early childhood I had to prove myself all the time.</span> <span id="s973">This – that was my feeling.</span> <span id="s974">I have to prove myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: To yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: To myself.</span> <span id="s977">But maybe to others, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s979">What was your profession?</span></p> <p><span id="s980">A: That I’m not deprived.</span> <span id="s981">That I’m not deprived, in spite my background [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s982">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s983">Well, had things not turned out the way they did, you wouldn’t have been deprived.</span> <span id="s984">You would have been in a very comfortable family, had there been no war, had there been no Holocaust –</span></p> <p><span id="s985">A: Yes</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Q: – had there been –</span></p> <p><span id="s987">A: Sure, sure, sure, sure, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">Q: – you would have, you know, it was like taking a child who would have had everything, and then putting her on the edge of extinction, you know.</span> <span id="s989">and just by strokes of luck, you know, were you spared death, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s990">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s991">Q: By some people who had come by at a crucial moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">Q: What was your profession?</span> <span id="s994">Did you have a profession?</span></p> <p><span id="s995">A: I’m a teacher.</span> <span id="s996">I am teaching [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s997">I’m a master teacher.</span> <span id="s998">And I am – I’m teaching NLP and like, this neuro-linguistic programming.</span> <span id="s999">I’m teaching it, and I’m giving courses and I also a therapist with neuro-linguistic programming.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Q: Wow, that’s impressive.</span> <span id="s1001">That’s very impre –</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">A: So, I am a teacher.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">Q: And, did you ever go to Poland, to Warsaw, to try and find out anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">Q: So you – everything that you’ve tried to find out is from a distance, geographical distance?</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">A: When I alla – when I decided, but I – but still, I – I know that [indecipherable] mother and her two children went to Poland together; that was her second time.</span> <span id="s1007">I didn’t go with them.</span> <span id="s1008">I didn’t.</span> <span id="s1009">And the feeling, all these years my feeling was, if I go to Warsaw, what am I going to look for?</span> <span id="s1010">I don’t have any thread of information where to look, or what to look for.</span> <span id="s1011">I can – I don’t have a address, I don’t have names, I don’t have any – anything.</span> <span id="s1012">And it was just another feeling of being sort of here, not being down there, rooted, just being –</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">Q: Floating.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">A: Floating.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">Q: Floating.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: Floating.</span> <span id="s1017">Which is even worse, it’s the worst I cou – I go there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">Q: Your father, you said you found out that he was a military officer through the internet, is that how?</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1020">Linda found it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">Q: Wow.</span> <span id="s1022">What – tell – bring me up to date chronologically.</span> <span id="s1023">After you belonged to this family, an-and had two wonderful – three – three bro –</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">A: Three wonderful –</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">Q: – wonderful brothers, how did you grow up, when did you marry, who did you marry?</span> <span id="s1026">Who were your chil –</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">A: I grew up – I – I – again, being different, all the children in the kibbutz had to learn the piano.</span> <span id="s1028">It’s a Polish kibbutz, and nice Polish girl have to play the piano, of course.</span> <span id="s1029">So, we played the piano, but I wanted to dance.</span> <span id="s1030">And they brought some dance teachers to the kibbutz, but that wasn’t enough.</span> <span id="s1031">So, Badana(ph) said, all right, I will fight for you.</span> <span id="s1032">I will get you this.</span> <span id="s1033">Yet, you have to carry on with the piano, because a dancer is not only with her legs and feet, she has to know.</span> <span id="s1034">I said okay.</span> <span id="s1035">So I was the only kid who used to go to Jerusalem at the age of 10 and studied in the conservat – conservatoire at that time.</span> <span id="s1036">And I studied dance.</span> <span id="s1037">And there – I always knew that I was – I want to be a dancer.</span> <span id="s1038">I knew that I want to be a musician because they – I – I always was very much intrigued by music, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: And you had an uncle who was a musician [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">A: And I had an uncle who was a musician, that’s right.</span> <span id="s1041">But I remember one day sitting in the children house in the kibbutz, and the – we had the radio, and the radio was playing Strauss waltzes, and I knew the music.</span> <span id="s1042">I was very young, eight, or – and I was humming with the music.</span> <span id="s1043">And everyone asked me, what di – what – how do you know this music, what do you [indecipherable] from?</span> <span id="s1044">And they don’t know.</span> <span id="s1045">I knew the music.</span> <span id="s1046">I knew the music.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: I understa –</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: Probably not from Bergen-Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">Q: Probably not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">Q: Probably not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">A: So, I – I always knew that there was – there are things in me, that I have a secret.</span> <span id="s1053">I don’t know what – that I have secrets.</span> <span id="s1054">So – so, in the kibbutz, I really – I really got what I wanted.</span> <span id="s1055">And then I started with – to work with the – with the children – children – children, young children.</span> <span id="s1056">I started to compose and to choreograph them.</span> <span id="s1057">And I grew up and I choreographed all the holidays.</span> <span id="s1058">So, from very a – early age.</span> <span id="s1059">And then I – I – I finished school early, that I went to the army, but – but I didn’t – it wasn’t for long because I had the rheumatic fever.</span> <span id="s1060">And I had – I been released a bay – by then, I already met the man that I was married to, that I got to – married to.</span> <span id="s1061">And he was a yon – young officer in the army.</span> <span id="s1062">We got married, we, of course didn’t stay in the kibbutz.</span> <span id="s1063">I didn’t want to stay in the kibbutz.</span> <span id="s1064">I mean, I knew that I will never live in the kibbutz.</span> <span id="s1065">And my mother used to say, Lily doesn’t like frames.</span> <span id="s1066">She cannot be in a frame, she has to be out of the frame.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">Q: Well, you were in a lot of frames, you know.</span> <span id="s1068">You were in a lot of closed enclosures –</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">Q: – for a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">A: Yes, I was.</span> <span id="s1072">So the kibbutz was –</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">A: – the one place that I had to get out of it, and I got – I got married, and we had my son.</span> <span id="s1075">And then – it was so – so much, is such – such a l – a long story, because we got married, we didn’t have money.</span> <span id="s1076">We lived in this remote place.</span> <span id="s1077">My husband was in the – in the official army, but then he decided to leave the army, and we lived in a remote place, completely alone.</span> <span id="s1078">I – I wer – raised my son.</span> <span id="s1079">It was nothing, it was like a desert.</span> <span id="s1080">Nothing, an-and we were completely alone.</span> <span id="s1081">And well, this was – this alone feeling, which was always with me, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">Q: Do you still have it now?</span> <span id="s1083">Do you still have it now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">A: Sometimes, yeah.</span> <span id="s1085">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Q: Sometimes no?</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">A: No-Now, this feeling of – the only – I – I have it and I – I – I always have to remember that I have my family, I have gre – my dre – granddaughters and my children, I mean, this is my really, anchor.</span> <span id="s1088">These are my anchor, my granddaughters.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">Q: Did you – did you have another child?</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">A: I have a daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q: You have a daughter?</span> <span id="s1092">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">A: From a di-different husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1095">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">A: I have a daughter and she has a little daughter.</span> <span id="s1097">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">Q: But the twins are your son’s children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">A: The twins, they’re my son’s children and he has another daughter.</span> <span id="s1100">So there are three daughters there, and one daughter on my daughter’s side.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">Q: Side.</span> <span id="s1102">I see.</span> <span id="s1103">And so, your daughter is how much – how many years younger than your son is?</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">A: Ten</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">Q: Ten.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">A: And my daughter, when she went to the – that was really strange, because a – again, I didn’t talk to her about it.</span> <span id="s1107">But when she was around 13 or 12 age old, I – she came with me to Israel, it was my son’s wedding, and I took her to Nuta(ph) Gudkowski(ph) and Nuta(ph) took her and told her about the camp, and she didn’t tell her so much about me, but Nuta(ph) was talking – you know, I – I always divide the people – the Holocaust survivors to f – to two.</span> <span id="s1108">There are those who ta – were talking, and those who didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">Q: And how do you view those who talked and those who didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">A: Nuta(ph) Gudkowski(ph) said that she will talk until the – the day she will close her eyes, she will tell – tell about it.</span> <span id="s1111">And many, many others didn’t talk, and many children – I think that most of the children didn’t talk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">Q: Do you think that one was better than the other?</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">A: No, I don’t judge.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">A: I don’t think that there is a judgment about what happened there.</span> <span id="s1116">I know that many people, when they came to Israel after the Holocaust, they been ask, why didn’t you do this, why didn’t you do that?</span> <span id="s1117">And you cannot judge them.</span> <span id="s1118">There is no judgment there, because you don’t – it’s so unbelievable what’s happened there.</span> <span id="s1119">You cannot grasp what happened there.</span> <span id="s1120">So you cannot judge.</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">Q: Lily, what happened now, chronologically, so that we have the full story, you ha – you got divorced from your first husband –</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">Q: – is this what happened?</span> <span id="s1124">And then you married a second husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">A: Yeah-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">Q: And who was he?</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">A: He was a dancer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">Q: He was a dancer?</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">A: [indecipherable] dance company.</span> <span id="s1130">We met in the – in the theater, we danced together in the theater.</span> <span id="s1131">And then he – it was again this long thing.</span> <span id="s1132">He had a – when my daughter was five months old, he had the car accident, and he was in the hospital.</span> <span id="s1133">And I was with my daughter.</span> <span id="s1134">And then when he was a – back home, after awhile, she – she had – she was born with a hernia in the diaphragm, and she was in the hospital for two years.</span> <span id="s1135">So, from the age of one til the age of three she was in the hospital.</span> <span id="s1136">And he had to s – really come back to his senses after this car accident.</span> <span id="s1137">And I was with her, and that again was this alone feeling.</span> <span id="s1138">That I was with her all the time in the hospital.</span> <span id="s1139">I was like one of the requisite, you know, chair.</span> <span id="s1140">Another chair in the hospital.</span> <span id="s1141">And this was ch – very, very familiar feeling, you know, that there’s nobody there.</span> <span id="s1142">She was three times dead, clinical dead, and – and I was there all the time, and that was just me.</span> <span id="s1143">Was ma – my f – my war, my battle.</span> <span id="s1144">Again, to fight for something, as if this is my fate, you know?</span> <span id="s1145">Always fighting.</span> <span id="s1146">And that was – that hit me very, very strongly among all the other things that happened with my daughter, that was one of the – also I remember, before she was born and my son was small, when he was just born and I was sitting – I was waking up in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s1147">And I know that many mothers always going to their children to see if they are breathing, but I was sitting there thinking, where was I, this age?</span> <span id="s1148">And I – I – I was so scared, I used to spend na – nights and nights and nights next to his bed, just waiting for them to – to come and take him.</span> <span id="s1149">So that’s when things came back, but I didn’t want to talk about it, cause whom I going to tell?</span> <span id="s1150">What am I going to say?</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">Q: Well, people also have to be ready to hear.</span> <span id="s1152">And sometimes they’re not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">Q: And when you feel like they’re not, then that’s when those questions come up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">A: It’s true, very true.</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">A: Very true.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">Q: That’s very lonely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">A: Yeah, very lonely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">Q: Is your daughter more receptive?</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">A: My daughter, she had a time when she went to the university, after she spoke to Nuta(ph), she came – we lived in England at that – at that time, and she had to do this essay about prisoners.</span> <span id="s1164">So she wrote the whole essay like a script, as her being in a war, age of 13.</span> <span id="s1165">And of course it ha – it was happy ever after at the end, was happy end.</span> <span id="s1166">But she wrote this script which was really now, breathtaking, and she won the first prize, and everything.</span> <span id="s1167">And I was thinking, gosh, where this came from?</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1169">Somewhere in the silence, it was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1171">And her – her subject, on her B.A. was hidden art in Nazi Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">Q: Where did she go to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">A: In England.</span> <span id="s1174">And she did – her B.A. was in – in England in Goldsmith College.</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">Q: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s1176">And do you live in England now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">A: No, I live in – I came back to Israel after 14 years.</span> <span id="s1178">She lives in England now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">Q: I see, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">A: But my son did his PhD.</span> <span id="s1181">in England, in scon – London School of Economics.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">Q: Oh, that’s my alma mater, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1184">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">Q: What did he – what is his PhD.</span> <span id="s1186">thesis?</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">A: In political – political science [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1188">And he’s the dean of NYU in Israel.</span> <span id="s1189">Proud mother, Jewish mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">Q: And why not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">A: I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">Q: Why not, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">A: And there – there – one thing he did, he went – what was happening is that th-they sending students for three months into different countries.</span> <span id="s1194">The – NYU has branches.</span> <span id="s1195">So they – the first lot of student came, and some of the things they studied was about the Holocaust, or Nazi Germany [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1196">And she came to me and ask me if I would like to talk to them, to those students.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">Q: Your son did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">A: Which was – yeah, which was really unusual for him.</span> <span id="s1199">And I did.</span> <span id="s1200">I said yes.</span> <span id="s1201">And when I came and they stood in front of this very, very young guy, used to – Israeli students are always 22 - 23, because they go to the army, and here they were 18 years old children.</span> <span id="s1202">I was looking at them and I was thinking, where do I begin to tell the story of my life?</span> <span id="s1203">And I decided not to talk about the war, and not to – I se – I – I was thinking that they can read about it, they can learn about it.</span> <span id="s1204">What I chose to talk about was how do you live with this story, and how you grow up, and how y – how you make your life and how you became a how – mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">Q: In what ways do you think it strengthened you, in what ways do you think it sup – took something away that you couldn’t replace?</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">A: I-I think that what strengthened me was the idea that I overcomed, I – I won something, and I wa – survived.</span> <span id="s1207">I think that surviving is the be – the biggest thing in me.</span> <span id="s1208">I’m a – I’m a survivor.</span> <span id="s1209">And whatever happened, I knew that I can stand on my own feet, even now, these days.</span> <span id="s1210">So, I – I – I have this strong feeling about it.</span> <span id="s1211">I think that what been taken away from me is my past.</span> <span id="s1212">I have this feeling that I don’t have a past.</span> <span id="s1213">That’s why I didn’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">Q: But you – but you don’t know it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">A: I don’t know it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">A: Not that long ago, I wanted – the – there are many people in Israel are a-applying for passports [indecipherable] in different countries because they want to be part of the common market.</span> <span id="s1218">And – and my granddaughters asked me to apply for a Polish passport because th-they might want to learn in – abroad.</span> <span id="s1219">So I called this woman, I gave her – I got number.</span> <span id="s1220">I got it – call this woman, she’s th – an Israeli speak – Hebrew speaking.</span> <span id="s1221">She works for the Polish embassy.</span> <span id="s1222">I called her and I told her my name, I told her that I was born in Warsaw, and they – she said, date of birth?</span> <span id="s1223">I said, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1224">So she said, wait a minute.</span> <span id="s1225">She went, she looked for something, then she came back to the phone, she said, you are not exist.</span> <span id="s1226">So immediately I said, for the German I was very exist.</span> <span id="s1227">So, this is – this is the thing; I don’t exist.</span> <span id="s1228">That’s why I do – I didn’t want to go to Poland, that’s why I don’t – maybe now, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1229">I have a friend in – in England.</span> <span id="s1230">She’s Polish, she’s not Jewish.</span> <span id="s1231">Polish th – couple, they are making films.</span> <span id="s1232">And she said to me, you know what?</span> <span id="s1233">I’ll go with you to Poland, to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1234">They really rebuilt old Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">Q: It’s true.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">A: So she said, we will go with the life, not with the death.</span> <span id="s1237">We will go to the – to the cafe they will – they might sit on the way to the theater, to the – to that restaurant, to that restaurant that you – they used to dance there.</span> <span id="s1238">You know, this where we should go, on [indecipherable] to the theater.</span> <span id="s1239">And I will go with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">Q: And does that thought intrigue you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">A: I – this – this I could accept, you know.</span> <span id="s1242">I couldn’t accept that I would go to something which is not exist any more.</span> <span id="s1243">And then – but I do have this feeling that it’s been taken away from me, very much so.</span> <span id="s1244">Maybe this is the reason that I didn’t want to talk to my children, because I – what could I tell them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">Q: My gosh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">A: They didn’t have grandmothers that they could relate to, grandfathers.</span> <span id="s1247">They didn’t have – they didn’t have any family they could relate to.</span> <span id="s1248">The only thing that I knew there, I knew the names, and by then I have pictures.</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">Q: Are these your only pictures?</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">A: No, I have some more.</span> <span id="s1251">Some more pictures.</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">Q: But probably not a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">A: No.</span> <span id="s1254">I have a – pictures from my – of my uncle in Paris, and I have the pink – picture of him standing on the s-stage with his clarinet.</span> <span id="s1255">And that was five minute before he died.</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">Q: Did he have a heart attack or something?</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">Q: And there was one thread lost, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">A: I know – I know why he esc – why he escaped from Poland, of course he escaped.</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">A: But th-the main reason we escaped, I know – this I know from him, that that one of the things that my mother told me, that he had to be in the Judenrite(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">Q: Mm-hm, Judenrat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">A: Judenrat in the ge – ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1265">And he didn’t want to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">A: So he managed to escape, and I’m sure that he had many friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">Q: Who could help him do th – did you ever see the movie, “The Pianist?”</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">A: Yeah, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">Q: Did you think of him as you were seeing that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">A: I was feeling – not only about him, I was think that the first scene there is Warsaw from above.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">A: And when I saw this, I said, this is the Warsaw that I was born to.</span> <span id="s1273">That was the click.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">A: That was the Warsaw I was born –</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">Q: I’ve been thinking about that as you’ve been speaking, you know, that there’s something in there that really connects.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">A: That was the place.</span> <span id="s1280">The other time – and I was thinking about him, because he wrote some very well known music [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1281">Where is my shtetl of bells, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">Q: I don’t know the music, but – but that’s very interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, we found him on the internet.</span> <span id="s1284">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">Q: So these fragments, these bits and pieces.</span> <span id="s1286">Lily, is there something I haven’t asked you about that you think is important to include in this part of the story?</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">A: I – the reason that I r-really wanted to come here and to do it – it, because I really wanted that my family would be somewhere.</span> <span id="s1288">Because [indecipherable] I’m not [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1289">So I wanted there to be some –</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">Q: There couldn’t be a better reason.</span> <span id="s1291">There couldn’t be a better one.</span> <span id="s1292">Thank you.</span></p>
