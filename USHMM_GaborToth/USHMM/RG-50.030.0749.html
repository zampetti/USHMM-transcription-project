be talking today, Mr. Neighborgall, about your experiences in World War II.</span> <span id="s21">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: Except I'm not 'Mr. Neighborgal'; I'm Roger.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s24">We're going to be talking with you, Roger, thank you -- about World War II -- your experiences there -- what you saw, and much much more -- what comes from that.</span> <span id="s25">But we're going to start at the beginning.</span> <span id="s26">And we want to get a sense of who you were as the war began and how old you were and things like that.</span> <span id="s27">So very first question is, "When were you born?</span> <span id="s28">Where were you born?</span> <span id="s29">And what was your name at birth?"</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s31">I was born in Garrett, Indiana on September 13, 1923.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: Gary, Indiana?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: Garrett -- G-A double R, E, double T.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: J-A double R?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: E, double T.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: Got it.</span> <span id="s37">Garrett.</span> <span id="s38">Were --</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: Garrett, Indiana is a suburb of Fort Wayne.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s41">And were you born into a large family or a small one?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: No, one sister who was two years older than me.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: What was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: Betty Jane.</span> <span id="s45">And my mother's name was Jane.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: And your father's?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: Homer.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: And how did your father support the family?</span> <span id="s49">I assume it was your father.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: He worked as a lumber inspector for the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad.</span> <span id="s51">Garrett, Indiana was a -- being an old railroad town, it was 150 miles from Chicago on the B&amp;O, and everybody in Garrett either worked for the B&amp;O or did something to support the people who worked for the B&amp;O -- like the grocery store.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: I got it.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: A drugstore.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s55">Do you have any earliest memories from either your home or your family or the town itself?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: Yes, I have lots of them.</span> <span id="s57">As a matter of fact, I continue in touch with one of my classmates.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: From grade school and from high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: Grade school and high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: Wow.</span> <span id="s63">So tell me a little bit about your family -- the family you were born into -- about your father, what kind of a person he was, your mother, and some of the values they tried to -- let's say, share with the kids and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s65">First of all we were very poor family.</span> <span id="s66">We lived in a 2-bedroom house, little frame house.</span> <span id="s67">I think we sold it for $2,000 or something when we left.</span> <span id="s68">Maybe $3,000.</span> <span id="s69">But that didn't bother me, because none of my friends had any money.</span> <span id="s70">It was the Depression was on in this country.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: Yeah, as you were growing up.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: As I was growing up, I grew up in depression.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: Did your father still have his job during the Depression?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: No, he worked wherever he could.</span> <span id="s75">But the B &amp; O laid off almost everybody except for the train crews.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: Mm-hmm.</span> <span id="s77">And did your mother have to work or try to?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: My mother was a nurse volunteer, and she volunteered at the Catholic hospital as a nurse's assistant but not for money.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: How large was Garrett, Indiana?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: Say again?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: How large was --</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: 5,000.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: Did you pretty much know most of the people there -- or did your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: Well, yeah -- that's good and bad, because everybody also knew me.</span> <span id="s85">[laughing]</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: [laughing]</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: If I did something wrong, my mother knew about it before I got home.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: Oh, that's a very effective network.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: [laughing]</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: Were your parents religious at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: My mother was very religious.</span> <span id="s92">My father -- medium.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: Can I ask which religion?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s95">My mother was a -- we grew up in a Presbyterian church.</span> <span id="s96">My mother was raised as a Catholic and changed to Protestant for my father.</span> <span id="s97">Then, after they were married for some period of time, she went back to the Catholic church and my sister went back with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: And yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: I became a Catholic during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: Did you?</span> <span id="s101">I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: In Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: And -- but, before the war, did you go to church?</span> <span id="s104">Did you go to services?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: Yes, we went to church every Sunday.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: So what's the difference between going to church and becoming a Catholic during the war?</span> <span id="s107">Going to church as a kid, and then --</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: I guess I don't really know.</span> <span id="s109">During the war I was convinced I wasn't going to live through it, and I decided I wanted to be buried as a Catholic.</span> <span id="s110">That was kind of the way it went.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s112">Were there many religions in Garrett, Indiana?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: Garrett was a very religious town.</span> <span id="s114">There were at least a dozen churches, maybe 15.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: Most of them were Protestant, or most of them were Catholic?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: No, no, no -- there was only one Catholic; the rest of them were all Protestant.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: But the Methodists, the Baptists -- they were all over the place.</span> <span id="s119">All my friends went to church.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s121">Regardless of which church, they all went to a church.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: Were there any Jewish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: Very few, but some.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: Did your paths ever cross with anybody who was Jewish as you were growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: Well, the -- the local men's haberdashery was run by a Stern family, and I knew them very well.</span> <span id="s127">But they didn't have any children.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: It was a husband and wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: It was husband and wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: How is it that you got to know them?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: I was very involved in athletics, and they were supporters of my work -- of my --</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: Activities?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: -- accomplishments in athletics.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: Did you ever have a part-time job as you were a teenager?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s136">As a matter of fact, I had a paper route of 75 customers, which I had from the fourth grade on.</span> <span id="s137">In about the fourth grade, my father said to me, "I would like for you to be the first Neighborgall to graduate from college, but you have to understand I don't have a penny to give you; you have to do it on your own."</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: Did you want that?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: And so, I immediately decided that the way I was going to get through college, which I did, was athlete scholarships.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: Ah -- I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: And that was what's -- that was my father instigated it when he said, "I want you to be a college graduate, but you have to understand I don't have any money to give you."</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: And is that what you meant by support from the Stern family is that they contributed in some way?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: No, not financially.</span> <span id="s144">They contributed by being active lookers in the audience.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: So they'd go to your games.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: Yeah, they'd go to games.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s148">Did -- what was high school like in the 30's?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: High school -- my class -- I think they are like 78 in my high school graduating class.</span> <span id="s150">I grew up, from the first grade to the seventh grade in about 60, and then the country schools came to high school, which served as a county high school as well as a city high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: So it enlarged -- the classes got bigger?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: Enlarged -- 17 or 18 came in from the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: Was there an immigrant population in your town?</span> <span id="s154">Did you know any kids in the class who were from, let's say, Europe -- or European refugees?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: [laughing] About half of them were immigrants.</span> <span id="s156">They're mostly from Ita -- Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: You have to understand, in a town of 5,000 where we're a railroad, that includes workers on the railroad that laid the ties, laid the track and so on so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: You know some towns -- because I'm not familiar with the Midwest -- some towns can be very homogenous, and some are not.</span> <span id="s160">And that's the sense I'm trying to get is, "How much were there -- how much influence was there?</span> <span id="s161">How much knowledge was there?</span> <span id="s162">How much interaction was there with people who either would have been Jewish, people who would have been from Europe, people who were different from, let's say, a midwestern American?"</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: Well, that's very interesting.</span> <span id="s164">Because when some new family moved in, the first question you ask them, "Can you play football or baseball or basketball?"</span> <span id="s165">[laughing].</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: Those were the important questions?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: Yeah, you do that, everything else is fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: [laughing] Those are not bad criteria actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: But -- okay.</span> <span id="s171">So I'll go about it this way.</span> <span id="s172">I'm trying to ask, "In school, were current events talked about?"</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: Current events were talked about, but only in Europe, not Japan.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s175">So in other words, you heard what was going on in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: We heard what was going on, but we truthfully didn't believe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s178">So this was in the 30's --</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: -- when Hitler comes to power?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: People in your town knew about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: I said "I was told about it, but I didn't believe it."</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: And what was it that you didn't believe?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: That there was a Hitler who was killing people and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: At that time in the 30's, it would have been like political people -- it would have been people who were opponents ideologically from his regime.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: Well, Hitler's speeches were on the radio.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: You mean you heard them in the original German?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: Wow.</span> <span id="s191">And were they translated then?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: No, except my mother could speak a little Dutch, a little German and so on.</span> <span id="s193">And my friends -- some of my friends.</span> <span id="s194">And my minister, whose name was Reverend Joe Jordan, he could speak German fluently.</span> <span id="s195">And he had been in World War I.</span> <span id="s196">So he pretty much kept us up to speed.</span> <span id="s197">He said -- again, I repeat -- I did not believe that this was actually happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: Yeah, okay.</span> <span id="s199">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: And you have to understand that I was raised in an isolationist atmosphere.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: That's what I wanted to get at too.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s203">The answer is that "We did not believe in being involved in other people's wars."</span> <span id="s204">Let Hitler do what he's going to do in Europe and so on so forth, but we're not going to be involved.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: That was a widespread feeling in the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: That was very widespread.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: Was it something that you took for granted as the right way to be?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: Did that change for you at any point?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: Pearl Harbor when I was a freshman in college.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: What college did you go into?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: It's funny, because I went to Indiana University on a full scholarship.</span> <span id="s213">But then my father was transferred from Garrett to Buchanan, West Virginia.</span> <span id="s214">So I transferred to University of West Virginia, and my sister did too.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: And she was going to college as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: She was a sophomore in college.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: She was a first semester junior when I was a first semester freshman at Indiana.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: That's pretty -- that's quite an accomplishment for a poor family.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: That's very unusual.</span> <span id="s221">In my high school class, I think either two or maybe three went to school --</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: -- beyond --</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: -- went to college.</span> <span id="s224">In fact, one of them went to nurse's school.</span> <span id="s225">Somebody else went to college.</span> <span id="s226">There's only three of us that went to college.</span> <span id="s227">The point being is that you could walk down to B &amp; O Railroad and get a job instantaneously.</span> <span id="s228">There was really no advantage of going to college -- financially.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: Well, by the time you finished.</span> <span id="s230">Because, when you started, it was still a depression.</span> <span id="s231">When did jobs come up again?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: Well, the answer is that the B &amp; O -- the B &amp; O did not do much hiring during the Depression, but there were jobs for kids, which paid, you know, $3.00 or $4.00 an hour.</span> <span id="s233">Now, it was way below -- what was the minimum wage then?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: Yeah, it probably would have been way less than $3 or $4.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: So it couldn't support a family, but it could employ a kid.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: So you're saying there wasn't that much incentive to going on to college because there was this choice.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s241">Still --</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: And, in addition to that, a fair number of kids' family lived on a farm.</span> <span id="s243">Indiana -- northern Indiana is a big farm area.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: So they were needed at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: They were needed at home, and they made their -- all had money.</span> <span id="s246">The farm kids all were financially stable, because they -- what they did was, they would bring in a pig or a cow and get credit for it at the grocery store for a long period of time.</span> <span id="s247">So those kids could take me and go into these grocery stores and always get a candy bar on a trade-type thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: And did they?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: Yeah, they sure did.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: Did you feel the difference between yourself being from a not so well-to-do family and the other kids or not so much?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: There was zero feeling -- zero feeling as far as wealth was concerned.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: As far as what?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: Wealth -- money was concerned.</span> <span id="s254">No one had much money.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s256">But I go back to it.</span> <span id="s257">It still is quite unusual and quite impressive that the two children in one family that is not so well-to-do end up going to college.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: What do you attribute that to?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: My grandfather paid for my sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s262">So education was something that was valued not only by your father but by his father.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s264">No -- by my mother's father.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: Uh-huh -- by your mother's father.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: And, when you were a freshman at -- was it in Indiana or West Virginia when Pearl Harbor happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: I was in Indiana University.</span> <span id="s270">It was the idea that I was going to stay there for four years and graduate --</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: -- on an athlete's scholarship.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: And you transferred to West Virginia at what point?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: At the end of my freshman year.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: So do you remember where you were when Pearl Harbor happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: Yes, I do remember where I was.</span> <span id="s279">I was -- I was with a group of friends, and we -- not a single soul had any idea where Pearl Harbor was located.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: How did you hear about it?</span> <span id="s281">How did you hear about the fact that Pearl Harbor is attacked?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: It was hard to believe, because the Japanese capability was absolutely unknown.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: So was it through the radio?</span> <span id="s284">Was it through newspapers?</span> <span id="s285">Was it word of mouth?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: It was radio.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: Radio.</span> <span id="s288">It must have been quite a shock.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: But then what happened, of course, was that -- that meant that the boys in school, a lot of them immediately volunteered for the service.</span> <span id="s290">I stayed for another year before I volunteered.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: And, when you volunteered, you were already in West Virginia; is this correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s294">Did you want to volunteer right away?</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s296">I was in ROTC, and I had my choice of staying for two more years and being a lieutenant or going right now and just make my way in in the military.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: And so, if you were in ROTC and you delayed at least that one year, did that make a difference?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: It made a difference in my ability as enlisted personnel in the army, because I knew an awful lot.</span> <span id="s299">I was already educated militarily.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: So in that year -- the one year that you were attending school -- what were you studying in addition to ROTC?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: My plan was to be a doctor.</span> <span id="s302">I was in pre-med.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: Wow -- wow.</span> <span id="s304">And why did you finally then sign up after only one year rather than two?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: I just felt that I should participate.</span> <span id="s306">Most of my friends were in the process of going to the military or being in the military.</span> <span id="s307">It just seemed like the thing to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: Did you talk about it at home with your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: My dad was dead-set against it.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s312">He did not want me -- he had been in World War I.</span> <span id="s313">He did not want me to get involved World War II.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: And you were how old when you signed up?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: Nineteen.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: Maybe 18.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s319">Well, it's kind of understandable your dad wouldn't want you to go to war, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: So, when you did sign up, what happened?</span> <span id="s322">How were you directed, or how did you choose one thing over another?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: I was sent to Fort Hayes, Ohio.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: And I remember the first night -- we were in a huge gymnasium-type thing.</span> <span id="s326">It was several hundred bunks around and with the snow and so on so forth.</span> <span id="s327">I didn't sleep the first night.</span> <span id="s328">I remember that very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: I assume that changed in the subsequent nights.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: Oh yeah -- I only stayed there for four days.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: And what was that place?</span> <span id="s332">Was that sort of like --</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: It was a -- it was a place where people got into the military.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: So it was sort of like a transfer place -- you joined, and from there they send you out to other places?</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s336">To get your shots, your understanding of your responsibilities insofar as life and death and so on so forth.</span> <span id="s337">Your NSLI -- National Life Insurance company position.</span> <span id="s338">It just got you oriented into the army, and then they sent you some place.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: Let me go back a little bit -- I want to go back to your father being dead-set against it.</span> <span id="s340">Did he eventually cave, or did you say "I'm going to do it anyway."</span> <span id="s341">?</span> <span id="s342">What kind of terms did you part on?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: [pause] Not very good terms.</span> <span id="s344">Not very good terms.</span> <span id="s345">But I immediately signed up to send money home to my family.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: Mm-hmm.</span> <span id="s347">From your pay?</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: From my pay.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: In other words, I sign up -- my family would depend upon me.</span> <span id="s351">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s353">And -- okay.</span> <span id="s354">Did things change then?</span> <span id="s355">You know, did it kind of like, before you were shipped overseas you had --</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: I wasn't shipped overseas from Fort Hayes.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s358">Then tell me what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: Okay?</span> <span id="s360">I was sent to Camp Croft, South Carolina.</span> <span id="s361">And I was there for two or three weeks.</span> <span id="s362">I have a very high IQ.</span> <span id="s363">And the army had something called ASTP -- Army Specialized Training Program, which was to take the brightest people in the army and make engineering officers out of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: Engineering officers -- okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s366">So the answer is -- is that I was just called up and said, "You're being shipped out."</span> <span id="s367">And I was going to go to Mississippi State College for engineering.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: Wow -- okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: And I did that for one year.</span> <span id="s370">And then the army decided they didn't need engineering officers.</span> <span id="s371">So they just canceled the program.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: But you had then a second year of college under your belt.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: Could you use it eventually?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: Not in the military.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: So, after they canceled, then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: I got sent to camp.</span> <span id="s378">I got sent to Camp Sheldon, Mississippi.</span> <span id="s379">In Camp Sheldon, Mississippi, I volunteered for the rangers.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: And tell me, what were the rangers?</span> <span id="s381">How are they different -- or how do they fit into the military, not being a military person at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s383">There was a sign on the bulletin board --</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: -- and it said, "We're seeking volunteers for a classified organization where loss of life is very high."</span> <span id="s386">And that's -- as a young soldier, that sounds very interesting to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: Not frightening at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: There was a sign that was on --</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s390">I'm going to read this out.</span> <span id="s391">This is from a presentation that you have given in the past and will give again on leadership.</span> <span id="s392">It's called "Leadership from a foxhole and passing the baton of freedom."</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: And it is one that you'll be speaking at the Elks Lodge in Fairfax, Virginia on May 4, 2014.</span> <span id="s395">And it's one of the slides there.</span> <span id="s396">And for the rangers, what the sign said -- "Volunteers wanted for a special classified mission.</span> <span id="s397">The risk of loss of life will be high.</span> <span id="s398">The ideal candidate will be unmarried and under 25 years of age and no physical disabilities whatsoever.</span> <span id="s399">Expert training in small arms and bayoneting is a requirement.</span> <span id="s400">Special skills such as demolition, radio operation, rubber boat handling, and parachuting is valuable.</span> <span id="s401">Those interested give your name to the first sergeant."</span> <span id="s402">So of this, what are those -- what are the various features -- the various, you know, points that they mention that caught your attention and you said, "Gee, I'm interested in that."</span> <span id="s403">?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: I thought I could do demolition, the radio operation, rubber boat handling, and -- with no problem.</span> <span id="s405">Remember, I was 19.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: Yeah, and you weren't scared about the loss of life?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: No, never --</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: Because 19-year-olds never die.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: No, you don't think about it.</span> <span id="s410">But you give your name to the first sergeant.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s412">And you did.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: And I did.</span> <span id="s414">And the first sergeant said, "I don't have the slightest idea what this is all about.</span> <span id="s415">Go to battalion."</span> <span id="s416">I go to battalion, and I talk to the sergeant major, "What is this all about?"</span> <span id="s417">"I don't have the slightest idea.</span> <span id="s418">Go to regimen."</span> <span id="s419">So I walk to regimen, and they didn't have the slightest idea.</span> <span id="s420">They sent me to division headquarters, and the first time I heard the word "Ranger."</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s422">So even then it was just volunteers without even the word "Rangers?"</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s425">So, when you get to division headquarters, this is all in Sheldon, Mississippi?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: No, no, no -- this is -- where am I?</span> <span id="s427">Where am I?</span> <span id="s428">Yeah, I guess maybe this was still at Camp Shelby -- yeah, it was.</span> <span id="s429">It's Camp Sheldon, Mississippi.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s431">And so you get to the division headquarters there.</span> <span id="s432">And this is the first time you hear "Rangers."</span> <span id="s433">And does anybody give you an explanation?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: They not only gave you an explanation, there were physical and mental tests involved.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: So for two weeks I did much road marching and took tests for mental stability and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: Do you remember anything about those tests?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: Yes, I remember it very well.</span> <span id="s439">And the answer is that there was maybe 100 guys to start out with, and it kept getting smaller and smaller and smaller.</span> <span id="s440">And so, for the final tests, there were ten of us left.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: What kind of mental tests?</span> <span id="s442">What did you have to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: They asked -- it was an interview-type thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: And one of the things was, "Are you -- is death a problem?"</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: Is death a problem?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s448">Not for a 19-year-old.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: Any other kinds of questions to kind of gauge mental stability?</span> <span id="s450">That you remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: No.</span> <span id="s452">I remember they -- they asked a lot of questions.</span> <span id="s453">In fact, you're asking here about growing up and so on.</span> <span id="s454">"Why do you want to be in the rangers?"</span> <span id="s455">That sort of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: It was kind of hard to answer why you want to be in the rangers if you don't know what the rangers are.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: Well, by this time I had a very thorough understanding that they were going to hit the beaches on D-Day.</span> <span id="s458">They were going to lead raids all through Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: So that kind of explanation had been given.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s461">And now, you get down to there's ten of us left, and there was the final test.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s463">What's the final test?</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: We lined up, and I had to be first.</span> <span id="s465">And there was a tent about the size of this room.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: Mm-hmm.</span> <span id="s467">And the room is about -- oh, about 8 x 8.</span> <span id="s468">Oh no -- 8 x 12?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: 10 x 20-type thing.</span> <span id="s470">8 x 18.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: And I hear "Neighborgall, come in."</span> <span id="s473">So I walk in this room, and it's fairly dark.</span> <span id="s474">Not very well lit.</span> <span id="s475">And behind a desk in front of me is the meanest-looking guy I ever saw in my life who's a ranger.</span> <span id="s476">My first ranger I've seen.</span> <span id="s477">He says, "Neighborgall, sit down."</span> <span id="s478">"Yes, sir."</span> <span id="s479">"Neighborgall, we don't trust anyone.</span> <span id="s480">Put your hands on the table."</span> <span id="s481">I did.</span> <span id="s482">He pulled a knife out and stuck it right in between my hands.</span> <span id="s483">I was petrified, but I never lost eye contact with him.</span> <span id="s484">He says, "Neighborgall, congratulations -- you're in."</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: No kidding.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: So that was the final test -- "Would you flinch?"</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: Now, I thought, "I wonder what the rest of these people are going to do?"</span> <span id="s489">So I stayed outside while the next guy went in.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: I heard a knife go on the table.</span> <span id="s492">Shhwww -- out the door.</span> <span id="s493">He wanted nothing to do with the rangers.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: Of the ten people, three or four of us passed.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: It was that selective.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: Wow.</span> <span id="s499">So, by this point, you kind of get a sense of the purpose of what this group is --</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: -- and they have done whatever tests they need to do to see whether or not you've got what it takes --</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: -- and what happens then?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: I get sent to a ranger outfit.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: What is a ranger outfit, and what did you do there?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s507">It was new.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: That's the dog keepers come by.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s510">The answer is that I'm now a member of the fifth rangers battalion.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s512">How large was this battalion?</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: Please.</span> <span id="s514">No, no -- no, no...</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: The dog is getting tangled in the wires.</span> <span id="s516">I'm just saying that for the interview purpose.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: A ranger battalion is 5 or 600.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s519">And what kind of further training was there?</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: The further training was in England with the British commandos.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: So when did you go over to England?</span> <span id="s522">Do you remember the dates -- approximate?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: D-Day --</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: Was '44.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: -- was '44.</span> <span id="s526">So I was in England February or March of '48 [sic].</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: Of '44 -- so the same year.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: And you had signed up in 1942?</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: So we're talking between the time you ship over to Europe and the time you signed up it was about a year and a half --</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: -- yes, of training --</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: Of training.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: -- and most of it was British commandos.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: In England.</span> <span id="s536">(phone ringing).</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: In England.</span> <span id="s538">That's my phone.</span> <span id="s539">My wife will take it.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s541">Hang on just a second.</span> <span id="s542">I'm going to -- okay.</span> <span id="s543">We can go forward.</span> <span id="s544">So where did you get sent to in England -- what part of the U.K.?</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: We landed at Birmingham.</span> <span id="s546">And I don't know where we were -- we were part-time in Scotland.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: Tell me -- before you -- before you got sent over, did you have an opportunity to say good-bye to your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: Had you told them that the rangers had this loss of life -- higher expectancy?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: They -- the answer is "no."</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s552">Yeah.</span> <span id="s553">Had your father reconciled by the time you left for England?</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s555">But my father also got ill and died.</span> <span id="s556">So my father was not there anymore.</span> <span id="s557">It was just my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: Oh, I see.</span> <span id="s559">So you lost him while you were in, you know, right after you enlisted?</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: It must have been hard for your mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: It was very difficult.</span> <span id="s563">But because of -- I was in the army, and of course, they gave me the opportunity to go to his funeral.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: I don't know what to say.</span> <span id="s565">I just can't imagine -- it must have been really hard -- for everybody -- for you, for your mom, for your sister.</span> <span id="s566">So, when you get over to the U.K., you land in Birmingham, and then do you get transferred to Scotland?</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: No, the answer -- we were -- part of the training was in Scotland.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: What kind of training was in Scotland?</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: Landing on beaches and climbing hills.</span> <span id="s570">Climbing.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s572">Now, forgive my knowledge here -- or lack of knowledge -- I thought D-Day was supposed to be a secret operation and that nobody knows about it.</span> <span id="s573">Was that not true?</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: No one knows the date.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: But everybody knew there was going to be something.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: There was going to be a breach of the -- of France some place.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s578">So it was widely known that there is going to be an assault on the fortifications.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s580">But, on the other hand, we were already fighting in Africa.</span> <span id="s581">We were already fighting in Sicily.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: And we were on the mainland of Italy.</span> <span id="s584">So that was the -- Roosevelt, as it turned out wanted to go immediately into D-Day -- to go into France -- but Churchill talked him out of it and decided to go through Sicily in Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: And this is while you're already in the U.K. and you're training?</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s587">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: The beaches that you trained on in Scotland, did they have the same height and depth?</span> <span id="s589">I mean, were they similar to those cliffs in Normandy?</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s592">Were they harder to climb?</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: Again, I'm a teenager.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: Of course, you can do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: You can do it.</span> <span id="s597">And then what happened?</span> <span id="s598">How long were you -- how long were you training in the U.K.?</span> <span id="s599">And what other kinds of activities were you being --</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: Well, the biggest challenge was the pubs.</span> <span id="s601">[laughing].</span> <span id="s602">But you have to understand England, there were very few men there.</span> <span id="s603">They were almost all gone.</span> <span id="s604">So there were lots of girls around --</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: Socializing.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: -- socializing.</span> <span id="s607">And there were -- the answer is the pubs, the American soldier was by far the best customer they had ever had.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: So there was a great social life.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: It was very great social life.</span> <span id="s610">"Social" insofar as you can work all day and drink beer at night if you wanted to.</span> <span id="s611">It wasn't mandatory.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: But did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: But it wasn't exactly social.</span> <span id="s614">I mean, you'd have a few beers with your buddies.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s616">Did you meet any British girls?</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: I -- we had a dance every Saturday night at the place where we were, and the British girls came chaperoned.</span> <span id="s618">And whenever -- I don't know, 11:30 or something like that, they all went home.</span> <span id="s619">And, if you were dancing with somebody, you couldn't hold them close to you; you had to hold them out here.</span> <span id="s620">If you got too close, a monitor would go along and separate you.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: Boy.</span> <span id="s622">Boy, I guess there was a great deal care taken there wouldn't be too much fraternization.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: Yes, that's true.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: Still, it's not the same thing as being on an army base and not being able to have any fun at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: I agree.</span> <span id="s626">I agree.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: And for young kids away from home, you know, about to face something --</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: Now, there was one thing that I should have brought up about Camp Sheldon, Mississippi.</span> <span id="s629">The Nesei American 442nd combat team were also there.</span> <span id="s630">And so, we maneuvered against them constantly in the -- this is Florida rangers.</span> <span id="s631">So for example, Senator Danny Inouye.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: Oh, yes -- from Hawaii -- Daniel Inouye.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: Yes, he was there as lieutenant.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: In this -- what did you call it again?</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: 442nd combat team.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: 442nd combat team.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: And they went to Italy.</span> <span id="s638">And they were like a ranger battalion.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: And they did very good work in Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q: Did you talk amongst yourselves about what you might expect?</span> <span id="s642">Did you talk amongst yourselves about what you were thinking of going forward?</span> <span id="s643">Or is it you just, you know, paid attention to what you had to do and not much talk going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: Not much talk going on about what was going to happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: Were you scared?</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: No, I didn't -- you remember I'm a 19-year-old kid.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: Either -- I graduate from high school, I was still 16.</span> <span id="s649">I went to college, but I just went to college -- I was 16, but my birthday is in September, so I was in college for one month before I was 17.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s651">And then you went -- and then the following year at 18 is when you enlist.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s654">And that's '42.</span> <span id="s655">So, during this time in the U.K., do you remember when it was that you got the order that, "Okay, we're leaving now."</span> <span id="s656">?</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: I don't.</span> <span id="s658">I don't remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: Do you remember being on the boats?</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: What were they like?</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: Prince Rupert.</span> <span id="s663">Prince Rupert was a British boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: Prince Rupert.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: Prince Rupert was a British boat.</span> <span id="s666">You understand -- they went across the channel to within sight of the beach in a big boat, a fairly big boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: Then they unloaded -- load you into small craft at the beaches.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: And you weren't yet -- let's say, if that was June '44 and you were born in 1923?</span> <span id="s670">You hadn't yet had your 21st birthday.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: No, I (indecipherable).</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: So you were 20 years old, and you hit the beach.</span> <span id="s673">And is there anything you want to tell me about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s674">A: Not a thing.</span> <span id="s675">I don't want to talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s677">And the reason you don't want to talk about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: It would keep me awake at night and so on if I got very heavily involved into it.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s680">I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: I -- after D-Day we joined -- my ranger battalion was assigned to Patton's third army.</span> <span id="s682">And that was before we had all the wonderful reconnaissance capability we have now and satellites and so on.</span> <span id="s683">When Patton wanted to know what was out there, [laughing] he sent the rangers to look and come back and tell him.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q: So I'm going to just bridge this a bit and say you survived the assault on Normandy on D-Day.</span> <span id="s685">And only one last question before we go forward -- and that is, "Were you able to sleep at that time after -- after you knew you were safe, did you have any chance to recover?"</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s687">No -- it didn't bother me.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: Didn't bother you.</span> <span id="s689">Okay.</span> <span id="s690">So when you -- what happened -- where did you get to?</span> <span id="s691">The assault's over.</span> <span id="s692">You survived.</span> <span id="s693">Where did you get to in France?</span> <span id="s694">Where did the rangers get to?</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: It's -- it's hard to describe.</span> <span id="s696">They went through a bunch of small towns.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">A: No big towns.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: Near the beaches?</span> <span id="s700">Not so far?</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A: Near the beaches.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: And then what were your tasks?</span> <span id="s703">What were your assignments?</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: We were a part of Patton's third army.</span> <span id="s705">And we were on individual missions.</span> <span id="s706">He would send us out there, attack the Germans, find out how strong they are, how many -- make a guess as to what the estimated numbers are concerned, and we did that continually.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: What kind of missions were you personally on; do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: They were all -- they were all the same type of missions.</span> <span id="s709">The answer is that you would go a certain distance before you ran into drillmen shooting at you.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Q: So in other words -- (walkie talkie talking).</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s712">So the missions were all similar, you're saying.</span> <span id="s713">But I'm trying to get a sense of, if I were on the ground -- or, if you were describing it to me in detail, what would you be experiencing?</span> <span id="s714">What would you be doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: Firing at Germans.</span> <span id="s716">And, by the way, the casualty list was very high.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: From this?</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s719">You would -- during missions like that, you'd expect 50% casualties.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: And you got them?</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s722">50% of us would be killed or wounded.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: So weren't you scared by this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: Weren't you scared by this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: I don't think "scared" --</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: That's not the word, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: No, that's because we're highly-trained.</span> <span id="s729">See, you're highly-trained so you wouldn't be scared.</span> <span id="s730">If you were scared and someone told you, "See that guy up on top of the hill with a machine gun?</span> <span id="s731">Go kill him."</span> <span id="s732">You wouldn't do that unless you were highly-trained.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s734">I guess what I'm trying to say is that, before you leave the U.K. -- before you leave England -- everything is theoretical.</span> <span id="s735">The minute you hit France, it stops being theoretical.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: Theoretical and training are the same thing to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: In other words, we were highly trained.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s740">So that -- so that that's what kicks in -- this almost-automatic response, "Okay.</span> <span id="s741">I know how to do this."</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: Was there any change, though, in you -- that you sensed in you -- when you saw all those casualties?</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: Did you ever come -- did you ever capture anybody?</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: Oh, lots of captures.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: Any interaction with those that you captured?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: I didn't speak German, but some of the rangers did.</span> <span id="s749">But there really wasn't any interaction.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q: What did these people look like -- these German soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: They looked just like us.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: Same age?</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: Same age.</span> <span id="s754">Blue-eyed like you are.</span> <span id="s755">[laughing].</span> <span id="s756">Except they're mostly blond-haired.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q: Yeah, not gray.</span> <span id="s758">[laughing].</span> <span id="s759">When did your missions change -- or did they change?</span> <span id="s760">Did you ever go -- it sounds like you were in skirmishes rather than actual battles at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: Well, remember -- we were 500 people.</span> <span id="s762">And that -- and we were never -- and we never attacked as 500.</span> <span id="s763">We always attacked as 25 or 30 or 40.</span> <span id="s764">Sometimes just a couple.</span> <span id="s765">Before we went into Germany, we came out of France and went to Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">A: And we went into Arlon, Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Q: Arlon.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: A-R-L-O-N.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: Arlon.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: Arlon, Belgium.</span> <span id="s772">And the second day we were there, while we were preparing to attack Germans, a delegation comes up to us and said, "We would like to play you a game of football."</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: What kind of delegation?</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: Maybe four, five people.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: Were they local people?</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: Local people, Arlon people.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s778">So were these guys from Arlon young guys?</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: Yeah, "We'd like to play you a game of football."</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: We said, "Well, we don't have a football.</span> <span id="s782">We don't have any capability and so on so forth, but we'll do it."</span> <span id="s783">So it was like seven or eight days.</span> <span id="s784">So we practiced like crazy.</span> <span id="s785">And I was a quarterback.</span> <span id="s786">And we thought we were -- we got pretty good at being a football team.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: When we walk into Arlon, Belgium, we see the first soccer field we ever seen in our life.</span> <span id="s789">"What is this?"</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Q: Different football.</span> <span id="s791">[laughing].</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: He says, "Well, look -- we're here.</span> <span id="s793">If you explain to us how you play this game, we'll still play."</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q: So you were at a disadvantage.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: So they explained to us how you play soccer.</span> <span id="s796">The big thing is you can't use your hands.</span> <span id="s797">That was bad news to Americans.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: But we played.</span> <span id="s800">And they had about 20 goals.</span> <span id="s801">We didn't have any.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">A: So finally we said, "Look, we're here.</span> <span id="s804">Let's play American football."</span> <span id="s805">And they said, "Okay.</span> <span id="s806">We don't know how you play American football.</span> <span id="s807">Well, tell us and we'll play."</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: And did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: They did not like blocking and tackling.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: [laughing].</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: Every time we got the ball, we scored a touchdown.</span> <span id="s812">So finally -- and, by the way, the stadium was jam-packed with people, and they were all screaming their heads off.</span> <span id="s813">And so, finally we said, "This has been a nice experience.</span> <span id="s814">Let's go to the bar and have a beer."</span> <span id="s815">And that's the way it ended.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: Well, it sounds like a wonderful thing to happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: Yes, it was a wonderful thing to happen.</span> <span id="s818">And by the way, I've been back to Arlon since then.</span> <span id="s819">And the stadium's there.</span> <span id="s820">And this thing is still there.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">Q: Oh, I see -- this is a sign.</span> <span id="s822">"The First of November 1944 Football Match."</span> <span id="s823">And it says "Match de Football avec black and white stocken le champion division 1942, '43, '44 versus selection American."</span> <span id="s824">And I can't speak French, but it's written -- there's something written in French -- I can't -- I don't know what it is -- but it is a sign announcing this football match.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A: Yes, and it's still there.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Q: That's really cool.</span> <span id="s827">So you were out of danger for a while, you were able to play for a while, and then what happens?</span> <span id="s828">To you.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: To me.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q: Mm-hmm -- to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: The rangers -- ranger battalion -- they were eight or nine officers.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">A: And all -- and I like all of them except one.</span> <span id="s834">And he was what we call "GI."</span> <span id="s835">"Yes, sir," "No, sir," "Yes, sir," "Yes, sir" -- you talk to him and you're always at attention and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">A: And so, one time he comes and says, "Neighborgall, you and I are going on a 2-man mission."</span> <span id="s838">And I said, "Tell me about it."</span> <span id="s839">He said, "You and I are going behind German lines to get information and so on so forth."</span> <span id="s840">I said, "Why me?</span> <span id="s841">You and I don't even get along."</span> <span id="s842">He said, "You're the best man for the job."</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: Did he tell you what the job was -- what kind of information?</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s845">The answer is -- is that we were to go behind the German lines and reconnoiter -- the answer is "Find out what was there and so on so forth" -- because we didn't really know what was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">A: And the way you do this -- you do it at night, and you hide during the day.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: So about the third or fourth day early in the morning, a German patrol spots us and fires at us.</span> <span id="s850">And he's hit in the legs --</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q: This officer you don't like --</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s853">And there were just two of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A: I have to think about that for a moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s857">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">A: Something about Lefkowitz.</span> <span id="s859">But anyway, the point is that now suddenly I'm his best friend.</span> <span id="s860">I'm his life and death getting out of there.</span> <span id="s861">It was snow on the ground.</span> <span id="s862">So I took his jacket off and put it in and cut down two pine trees about this high --</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Q: That would be about four or five feet.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">A: Yeah, four or five feet.</span> <span id="s865">I mean, and I made a slab out of them which I can pull.</span> <span id="s866">So I pull him back three miles to the American line.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">Q: Did he survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s868">A: And he survived.</span> <span id="s869">(phone ringing).</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Q: Were you able to -- hang on a minute.</span> <span id="s871">Did you find out the information you needed to find out before he was hit?</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: We found out that there were Germans back there, but we didn't complete the mission.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s874">And do you remember what part of the country you were in?</span></p> <p><span id="s875">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s876">We were in -- in Germany and not too far from the Belgium border.</span> <span id="s877">That's all I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s879">Would it have been close to Aachen -- which is close to the Belgian border, a major German city?</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A: Yeah, Aachen was already a battle.</span> <span id="s881">But we were not into it.</span> <span id="s882">Aachen was a -- Aachen was a huge battle.</span> <span id="s883">There were probably 1,000 Americans involved -- 800 or 1,000.</span> <span id="s884">And not small groups like us.</span> <span id="s885">It was a big division-type thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q: But you weren't close to there.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">A: No, no -- we were not near Aachen.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">Q: At that -- I want to pause for a second and switch our topic just a little bit.</span> <span id="s889">The last time I asked you about world affairs is, you're in high school and you're hearing Hitler's speeches.</span> <span id="s890">As time progressed and as the years went on and now you've joined the army and you were in uniform -- I mean, you were in college and then you're in uniform and so on -- did you continue hearing about what Hitler was doing even being in the U.K., being in England, or was the news mostly about the actual war -- battles here, battles there?</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A: There was a newspaper called "The Stars and Stripes," which was a weekly, and it had some world news in it -- but not much about Japan.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: Not much about Japan.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Q: Did you know by the time you got to Normandy that there was a special kind of treatment that Jews were getting across Europe?</span> <span id="s895">Did you know anything about the concentration camps, about civilians being persecuted?</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: I told you -- when I was in high school, there was a rumor kind of floating around of things like this were going on, but I never believed it, and it never got much authenticity.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: Was there a time when that changed?</span> <span id="s900">When you started to believe it?</span></p> <p><span id="s901">A: I didn't believe it until after the war was over.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s903">A: I didn't really believe it, because we never got into concentration camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">Q: So you were never at concentration camps while you were in service?</span></p> <p><span id="s905">A: No.</span> <span id="s906">And the reason I wasn't is because the rangers were involved in it at the last -- when I was in monuments bend.</span> <span id="s907">In other words, I was pulled out of the rangers -- which reminds me -- my ranger battalion went into Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q: They did?</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">Q: Your ranger battalion went into Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s911">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A: But the answer is, "They weren't the first ones there."</span></p> <p><span id="s914">Q: No, they weren't.</span> <span id="s915">They couldn't have been.</span> <span id="s916">It was the Russians who came before them.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s919">Okay.</span> <span id="s920">Did you talk to the guys afterwards, after they went in; was this the first time they would have heard anything or seen anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s921">A: Yes, I talked to them -- but not in much detail.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Q: Do you remember --</span></p> <p><span id="s923">A: And when I said, "Auschwitz," it may not have been Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s924">Linz?</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: Linz is in Austria.</span> <span id="s926">That was one of Hitler -- that was Hitler's home.</span> <span id="s927">His parents were buried there.</span> <span id="s928">And then --</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A: Linz is where Hitler's parents were buried -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">Q: Correct.</span> <span id="s931">And then Mauthausen was a concentration camp in Austria.</span> <span id="s932">Could it have been that the rangers went to Mauthausen?</span></p> <p><span id="s933">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s934">The answer is, "When I say 'Auschwitz', I know that's not correct."</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s936">It's a major concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: Yeah, a major concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">Q: But you don't know which one.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">A: No.</span> <span id="s940">I can't remember.</span> <span id="s941">I was told, but I can't remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s943">And, when people did say they had been there, what do you remember them telling you?</span></p> <p><span id="s944">A: Well, they came up with facts and figures -- I mean, not "facts and figures," but they came up with descriptions which defied absolute logic.</span> <span id="s945">Even though people had seen it, it's really hard to accept unless you've seen it yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">Q: So it didn't really sink in with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">A: Say again?</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: It didn't sink in with you that much.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: No, it did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: Was there a point when it did sink in with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s951">A: Yeah, after the war was over and I started getting more information.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">A: The average American did not have a realization of how bad it was.</span> <span id="s954">[pause].</span> <span id="s955">I mean, it was -- it was still hard for people to accept that something like this could happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Q: Yep.</span> <span id="s957">It's, you know, what we're doing now is trying to reconstruct what it looked like then.</span> <span id="s958">That's not so easy to do, but it's part of trying to get an historical record through, you know, a medium like an oral history interview is to remember what you didn't know at the time.</span> <span id="s959">That's not so hard -- that's not so easy to do when you already know something.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s962">Let's go back then to -- you know, you bring this officer back whom you were his now lifesaver.</span> <span id="s963">You dragged him back to your lines.</span> <span id="s964">You weren't able to finish your mission.</span> <span id="s965">What happened then?</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A: Battle of the Bulge.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">Q: And you were in it?</span></p> <p><span id="s968">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">Q: In what way?</span> <span id="s970">What was your experience of the battle?</span></p> <p><span id="s971">A: The Battle of the Bulge was a complete surprise to the Americans -- to Eisenhower and so on so forth.</span> <span id="s972">On Christmas Day, I was -- in the morning I had been on a mission -- a reconnaissance mission -- and I came back, and I was laying down to sleep and someone came in -- I was in a house, in somebody's house, and all I remember is I pick up my rifle and ran to the window, because I thought they were telling me that we were being attacked right then.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">Q: And what was the actual case?</span></p> <p><span id="s974">A: The actual case was that -- there's the Battle of the Bulge.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s976">You're showing me a slide of the German attack based on the weather.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">A: This was -- Eisenhower is here.</span> <span id="s978">And he put his line right across the Battle of the Bulge and divided the responsibility between Patton in the south and Montgomery in the north.</span> <span id="s979">So British troops here were under Patton.</span> <span id="s980">American troops up here were under Montgomery.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">Q: Isn't that interesting.</span> <span id="s982">You know -- a switch, that British troops would be under an American general.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">A: But that was only because he had to have some responsibility.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Q: Where were you on this map?</span></p> <p><span id="s985">A: Down here.</span> <span id="s986">And we were -- the third army was attacking east.</span> <span id="s987">When Patton got the mission of this, he moved about 100,000 people from attacking east to attacking north.</span> <span id="s988">And the weather was bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s990">A: It was snowing and so on so forth.</span> <span id="s991">And right there is Bastogne.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">Q: That's right.</span> <span id="s993">I see Bastogne.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">A: And we captured that.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Q: And you were part of the group that did?</span></p> <p><span id="s996">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">A: And there's where I got into -- I rode a tank.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">Q: Is that you on the tank?</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">A: That's not this one.</span> <span id="s1001">It's a tank like that that I was on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1003">And here we have a photo of -- of looking like we're going through forests and really heavy snow on the fir trees and heavy snow on the tank itself.</span> <span id="s1004">It looks like blizzardy weather conditions.</span> <span id="s1005">Miserable, in other words.</span> <span id="s1006">Miserable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1008">And someone said, "That couldn't have been very comfortable."</span> <span id="s1009">And I said, "It's better than walking."</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">A: Now, something unusual happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">Q: What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">A: When the tank I was on got to where the Germans were firing at us --</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">A: -- we jumped off the tank.</span> <span id="s1016">And I jumped off and put my weapon up to my -- to start firing.</span> <span id="s1017">And I was with my friend Bill Pretty[?]</span> <span id="s1018">, and the first thing I noticed was my weapon had stuck to my cheek.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">Q: [sucking in a breath of surprise].</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">A: So he said, "Keep firing, Roger, and I'll blow on it."</span> <span id="s1021">So he blew on it, and the weapon came off my cheek.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">Q: It was that cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">A: It was that cold.</span> <span id="s1024">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">Q: Wow.</span> <span id="s1026">Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1028">Here we go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1030">So here we are.</span> <span id="s1031">This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Roger Neighborgall.</span> <span id="s1032">And did I -- I say that correctly, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">Q: And we were talking about the Battle of the Bulge and how --</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1036">And when the Battle of the Bulge was over, we lost 60% of our people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">Q: The Rangers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">A: The Rangers lost 60%.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: That's a huge loss.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">A: So we were training recruits back behind the lines.</span> <span id="s1041">And we're walking down this country road, which is like three miles behind the front lines --</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">A: -- and this jeep comes right up and stops beside me, and there's Patton in the front seat.</span> <span id="s1044">And he tells the guy in front of me.</span> <span id="s1045">And I hear the whole conversation.</span> <span id="s1046">He says, "Son, what outfit is this?"</span> <span id="s1047">He says, "Sir, this is your shift regular time."</span> <span id="s1048">He says, "I know that, but what the fuck are you doing back here?"</span> <span id="s1049">He said, "The war's up that way."</span> <span id="s1050">[laughing].</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">Q: [laughing].</span> <span id="s1052">Oh God.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">A: And my friend in front of me said, "Sir, we're training recruits.</span> <span id="s1054">We lost 60% of the people in the Battle of the Bulge, and we now are training recruits."</span> <span id="s1055">And he said, "You can train people in the front line as well as you can train them back here."</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">A: And so, they drove off.</span> <span id="s1058">That was my conversation with Patton.</span> <span id="s1059">And that night we got sent back to the front line to do our training there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">Q: So he issued an order.</span> <span id="s1061">It wasn't like he was in a bad mood and drove by.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">Q: No?</span> <span id="s1064">He got your back there, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">A: [laughing].</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">Q: So what was it like training at the front lines?</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">A: Well, the front lines -- the front lines were -- it wasn't like a line -- solid line of people.</span> <span id="s1068">It was people here, there, and so on so forth.</span> <span id="s1069">So the answer is that, "We kept training, and we kept -- we did missions as we normally do."</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1071">At this point -- remind me again, the Battle of the Bulge was fought in what time?</span> <span id="s1072">It was the Christmas of '44.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">Q: And how long did it last?</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">A: Lasted about ten days.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1077">So you were in early January '45.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">Q: And then you're training these recruits.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">Q: And so we're talking January, early February.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">A: Yeah -- yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">Q: What happens to you then?</span> <span id="s1084">How do things progress for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">A: Well, the ranger -- my rangers are completely -- we're still at war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Q: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">A: So we get missions from Patton.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1089">And that's the same kind of reconnaissance missions?</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">A: Yeah, same kind of reconnaissance missions that we had.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">A: Recon mission is you go some place -- say, you find out the Germans are there, then you fight.</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">Q: Easy, huh?</span> <span id="s1094">Or easily said.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">Q: At what point does the Monuments Men come into the picture?</span> <span id="s1097">Kind of try and bring us up to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">A: In April.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">Q: Oh, so you have an entire winter that you're still --</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">A: Fighting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">Q: -- still fighting.</span> <span id="s1102">Okay.</span> <span id="s1103">All right.</span> <span id="s1104">So in April, which is just a month and a half before the war ends --</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">A: -- yeah, but we didn't know it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">Q: -- of course you didn't know.</span> <span id="s1107">Where were you at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">A: [pause] I think in Bavaria.</span> <span id="s1109">Bavaria.</span> <span id="s1110">Near Munich.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1112">So how were you pulled from what you were doing to join the Monuments Men?</span> <span id="s1113">What happens?</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">A: I got a call to go see the colonel.</span> <span id="s1115">And I said to myself, "What have I done wrong to deserve -- to deserve personal treatment?"</span> <span id="s1116">So I was going to him, and I said, "Sir, Neighborgall reporting as requested."</span> <span id="s1117">He said, "Go get everything you own, including a bag of explosives."</span> <span id="s1118">I said, "Yes, sir."</span> <span id="s1119">So I went back an hour to get organized, and I come back.</span> <span id="s1120">And I said, "Yes, sir."</span> <span id="s1121">He says, "See that guy in the jeep over there?"</span> <span id="s1122">And I said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s1123">He said, "Go there and report to him."</span> <span id="s1124">So I go report to him, and he says, "Get in, Neighborgall."</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">Q: And who's the person you report to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">A: He was a colonel in the intelligence corps.</span> <span id="s1127">And at this point in time I never heard the word "Monuments Men."</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">Q: Do you remember his name -- the colonel in the intelligence corps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1131">So you hadn't heard of the Monuments Men -- or you hadn't heard of the effort?</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">A: No, I had not heard of Monuments Men.</span> <span id="s1133">I didn't know that there was such a -- someone who was interested in saving the arts.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">A: So I said to him, you know, "Here I am, what do you want me to do?"</span> <span id="s1136">He said, "Well, in the Bavarian area, there are several banks that we think have Jewish -- stolen Jewish property in them.</span> <span id="s1137">What we're going to do is, we're going to go up and ask for the people to open the vaults so we can inspect them.</span> <span id="s1138">But we think they're going to give us 100 reasons why they can't open the vault.</span> <span id="s1139">'It's time sensitive, that no one knows the conversation', so on so forth."</span> <span id="s1140">Then I'm going to say, "Neighborgall, blow open the door."</span> <span id="s1141">So I had experience blowing open till* lock doors where you put an explosive on the handle.</span> <span id="s1142">When it goes off, the handle goes flying and the door comes open.</span> <span id="s1143">If you do that on a vault, nothing happens.</span> <span id="s1144">You're in a learning curve.</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">Q: Oh my gosh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">A: So I tried several things.</span> <span id="s1147">And finally --</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">Q: So -- okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">A: If this were -- if this were a door, a bank door -- here's the handle --</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">A: -- I put explosives all the way around like so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">Q: So in other words, you put explosives around the frame of the door.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1155">And this was -- when you got -- was this as a practice, or was this when you got to the bank?</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">A: Oh, I'm in a bank.</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">Q: So in other words, what he was saying came happen -- happened.</span> <span id="s1158">He went to the bank.</span> <span id="s1159">People said, "We can't open it."</span> <span id="s1160">And so on so forth.</span> <span id="s1161">And he says --</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">A: "Neighborgall, blow it."</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">Q: So you surround it with explosives.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">A: As I said, that was the end of the learning curve.</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">A: I tried several things first.</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">Q: Ah...</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">A: I tried to first of all -- the second thing I tried was on the hinges.</span> <span id="s1169">If I blow the hinges, would the door open?</span> <span id="s1170">The answer is, "nothing happened."</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">Q: So one fail, another fail, and this was the final effort, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">Q: What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">A: The door flies off.</span> <span id="s1175">Door just goes -- falls over.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">Q: And what was inside?</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">A: Everything you could possibly imagine in gold.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">Q: Gold bars?</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">A: Gold bars.</span> <span id="s1180">Gold -- [pause].</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">Q: We're looking at, again, a presentation which you're going to be giving.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">A: [pause].</span> <span id="s1183">Well, it's not in here, but it is some place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1185">We can pause a little bit.</span> <span id="s1186">Was that -- wait, hang on -- was this flag in there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">A: We'll see that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">Q: But was this in the bank vault, or is that just something else?</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">A: No, I got that in a separate mission later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1191">This is a Nazi flag that you have.</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">A: On the other hand -- let me go on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">Q: Sure.</span> <span id="s1194">Go on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">A: We're at this bank in Bavaria.</span> <span id="s1196">That's yours.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">Q: Oh, thank you.</span> <span id="s1198">Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">A: And I'm there the two or three days.</span> <span id="s1200">All of -- the colonel, the driver, myself were there by ourselves the first night.</span> <span id="s1201">Then other people came.</span> <span id="s1202">And then I heard the word "Monuments Men" mentioned for the first time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">Q: When you say that you were there the first night, did that mean you stayed in the bank to make sure it did not get looted?</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">A: Yes, we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">Q: So you slept there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">Q: And what kind of German officials were you meeting that weren't going to open the bank vault?</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">A: The head of the bank.</span> <span id="s1209">The people -- bank employees.</span> <span id="s1210">In Germany, the head of the bank lives in the same building as the bank.</span> <span id="s1211">It is an apartment involved with the bank -- with the vault.</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1213">Do you remember the name of this particular bank and where it was located?</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">A: No, I can't remember.</span> <span id="s1215">He said it was on the Danube River.</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">Q: It was on the Danube River some place in Bavaria.</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">Q: And, when you went in, you say you saw everything in there.</span> <span id="s1219">So you saw gold bars.</span> <span id="s1220">Were there photo?</span> <span id="s1221">I mean, not photos -- were there portraits?</span> <span id="s1222">Was there art?</span> <span id="s1223">Were there sculptures?</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">A: There was all of those -- all of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">Q: How large was it -- this bank vault?</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">A: Very large.</span> <span id="s1227">It was probably three times the size of this room.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1229">And again we said this room is about --</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">A: 8 x 18.</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">Q: 8 x 18.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">A: So about 30 x 40.</span> <span id="s1233">It was big.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">Q: And the gold bars -- was there any way of knowing who this stuff belonged to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">A: Our job was to open the vault.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">A: Other Monuments Men inventoried everything.</span> <span id="s1238">We did not do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">A: And their goal was to find out who it belonged to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1242">So I'm getting ahead of myself a little bit -- you say you stayed there a couple of days.</span> <span id="s1243">The first night it was just three of you -- you, the colonel, and the driver.</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">Q: The second day someone else came by?</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">A: Other Monuments Men came by.</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">Q: That's when you first heard of "Monuments Men?"</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1249">And they joked with me saying, "We're all volunteers here -- the first draftees."</span> <span id="s1250">The first person drafted.</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">Q: Does this mean you were then permanently reassigned to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">A: No, I stayed with them for [pause] -- three weeks maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">Q: So for three weeks in April 1945 you were going around with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1255">We went to half a dozen banks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1257">That was going to be my next question, "How many of these places did you open up?"</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">A: [pause].</span> <span id="s1259">By the way, there is a bio.</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">Q: Oh, thank you -- thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">A: And here's a picture for you of my silver star.</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">Q: Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">A: And in order to make sense out of that, you need to [pause] -- you need the front and the back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">A: This is the bank.</span> <span id="s1266">This is the back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">A: And there's the silver star right there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">Q: Here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">Q: I'll take a look later.</span> <span id="s1272">I mean, I'll take a look right now, but we'll continue.</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">A: And you got a copy of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">Q: I do.</span> <span id="s1275">Thank you so much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">A: And over here you'll see my name.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">Q: It's quite beautiful.</span> <span id="s1278">Very distinguished.</span> <span id="s1279">I see it.</span> <span id="s1280">I see it.</span> <span id="s1281">It says, "For gallantry in action, Roger Neighborgall."</span> <span id="s1282">So did the subsequent places that you went to with the Monuments Men, did they have other kinds of items in those vaults?</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">A: Well, let me go on to the second and third night.</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">Q: Yeah, sure.</span> <span id="s1285">Tell me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1287">At lunchtime, I'm kind of fed up with the whole thing.</span> <span id="s1288">I want to get off by myself.</span> <span id="s1289">So I get a sandwich and glasses of something to drink to go down by the Danube River.</span> <span id="s1290">And there's a dock in front of me in the river.</span> <span id="s1291">And much to my shock a German fast patrol boat -- German navy -- comes up and docks right in front of me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">Q: But I thought this would have been conquered territory.</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">A: Well, the answer is, "They thought I was a German in American uniform."</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">A: Yes, that's what they thought.</span> <span id="s1296">And one of the crew of four speaks English.</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">A: They jump off.</span> <span id="s1299">I have the machine gun, and I quickly take them prisoner.</span> <span id="s1300">My decision is, "What do I do?"</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">A: The answer is, "I can kill them right then, and that would have been legal."</span> <span id="s1303">But, if I take them prisoner, then you can't do anything with them.</span> <span id="s1304">So some reason or other, I came up with the following logic, "Give me the buttons off your uniform, give me your flag, and get the hell out of here."</span> <span id="s1305">They thought that was a good deal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">Q: [laughing].</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">A: [laughing].</span> <span id="s1308">So that's the German -- that's the flag.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">Q: So this is how you came to have the flag, and that was on their boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">A: It was on German fast patrol -- a river destroyer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">Q: A river destroyer.</span> <span id="s1312">Oh my -- and so, you have the flag from that.</span> <span id="s1313">And you have their buttons.</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">A: And I have their buttons.</span> <span id="s1315">I made it into cuff links, and I have them.</span> <span id="s1316">And I'll show them to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1318">Okay.</span> <span id="s1319">So, while the vaults had gold and art, you had these kinds of souvenirs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1322">And that was the second day?</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1324">It was the second day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">Q: About how many Monuments Men did you meet?</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">A: Maybe a dozen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1328">And then I go back to my other question, "When you got to the bank vaults of the other banks in the area when you were, you know, driving around with them, was there any more different kind of materials in those vaults or more of the same -- gold?"</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">A: That was the inventory of the first bank.</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1331">I'm going to read this out.</span> <span id="s1332">This is a single Bavarian bank in April 1945.</span> <span id="s1333">And you had 23 -- why don't you read it out.</span> <span id="s1334">What was inventoried there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">A: This -- this was by memory.</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">Q: Got it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">A: There were Treasury gold bars.</span> <span id="s1338">Twelve bags of American $20 gold pieces.</span> <span id="s1339">Eighteen bags of other coins -- gold coins.</span> <span id="s1340">Twenty-five bags of German Reich marks.</span> <span id="s1341">Persian rugs, artwork, and furniture.</span> <span id="s1342">It was all there.</span> <span id="s1343">But my job was not to inventory it; there were other people assigned to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1345">And then the other banks it was similar stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">A: Similar stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1348">And did you get resistance in the other banks, or did anybody at those other banks say, "Okay.</span> <span id="s1349">We'll open it right up."</span> <span id="s1350">?</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">A: No.</span> <span id="s1352">Out of the five or six banks, we blew open three doors.</span> <span id="s1353">[coughing].</span> <span id="s1354">Excuse me.</span> <span id="s1355">And they opened the rest up.</span> <span id="s1356">[pouring a drink for interviewer].</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1358">No, enough for me -- thank you.</span> <span id="s1359">I'm done.</span> <span id="s1360">I'm done.</span> <span id="s1361">I take it you must have seen the movie "Monuments Men."</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">A: I must have seen -- ?</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">Q: -- the movie "Monuments Men."</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">Q: What do you think of it -- having been a Monuments Man yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">A: I also have the book, Monuments Men.</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">Q: That's right.</span> <span id="s1368">And read the book.</span> <span id="s1369">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">A: Have you seen the book?</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">Q: I have the book too.</span> <span id="s1372">I haven't finished reading it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1374">There's the answer, "It's hard to read."</span> <span id="s1375">It takes you all day to read -- months to read it all.</span> <span id="s1376">There's a lot of information there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">Q: Mm-hmm.</span> <span id="s1378">But what about the film?</span> <span id="s1379">Because most people will have seen the film.</span> <span id="s1380">How accurate was the film compared --</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">A: The film was accurate, but I didn't -- the film allowed me to put together some of the things I had seen which I didn't really understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1383">So it put things in context for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1385">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1387">And yet, you had heard of the Monuments Men when you were on the mission, so you knew the two were alike.</span> <span id="s1388">I mean, you knew they were all part of the same effort.</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">A: Yeah, I knew -- but I didn't quite know [pause].</span> <span id="s1390">They were part of MFAA -- Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">A: And it was founded in June 1943 as a joint USA and Great Britain organization.</span> <span id="s1393">And it was in the civil affairs branch of the allied military government -- I forgot my territory.</span> <span id="s1394">And it was justified United States by the Roberts Commission.</span> <span id="s1395">And I looked all that up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">Q: So was it that -- how come your tenure with them ended?</span> <span id="s1397">How come you were only there with them for three weeks and not longer?</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">A: I can't remember, but they took me back there.</span> <span id="s1399">They took me back to the rangers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">Q: They maybe didn't need explosive experts anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">A: I think that they thought that they -- well, the war was winding down, and I think they thought they were not going to have to blow open any more bank vaults.</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">Q: But I want to clear one thing, just to make sure I got it right -- in all the bank vaults that you did blow up in all the places that you visited, this was already territory that was occupied by the Allied forces; correct?</span> <span id="s1403">It was conquered territory.</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1406">Okay.</span> <span id="s1407">Did they take --</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">A: But recently.</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">Q: I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">A: When they got involved in immediate -- as soon as they could.</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">Q: Got it.</span> <span id="s1412">So it's newly-conquered, and they -- and they get to it right away before anything can happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1415">Did they take you back to the same place where you were stationed before?</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">A: Rangers had moved in the meantime.</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">Q: And where did you go then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">A: It was still in Bavaria, but the rangers had moved.</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">Q: Did you see any military action after finishing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">A: There was military action until Germans surrendered.</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">A: In fact, there was some military action after the Germans surrendered, because some of the Germans didn't get the word.</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">Q: So what kind of events were you involved with after -- after --</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">A: It was the same thing -- it was armed reconnaissance.</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">Q: Armed reconnaissance -- okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">Q: And where were you when the war ended?</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">A: Where was I when the war ended?</span> <span id="s1431">In Markgraffin, [Markt Schwaben?]</span> <span id="s1432">Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">Q: Markgraffin?</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">A: Which is near Munich.</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">Q: Did you hear of da'hal [?]</span> <span id="s1436">when you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">A: Again, the answer to that is "yes, but the details were not very great."</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1439">So you're outside of Munich when the war ends, and how does your work change?</span> <span id="s1440">What do you -- what happens to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">A: I'm put in the army of occupation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">Q: What did that mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">A: Right after the Germans surrendered, then there's an army of occupation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1444">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">A: And the goal is to get as many people to Japan as possible.</span> <span id="s1446">And the ranger responsibility was to come back home and then go to Japan and do the same thing to the Japanese -- D-Day.</span> <span id="s1447">But it didn't happen because the atomic bomb and the Japanese surrendered.</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1449">So between May and August 1945, are you still in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1451">Q: And what were you specifically doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">A: As I said, army of occupation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">Q: But your role in it.</span> <span id="s1454">What was your role in the army of occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">A: Well, I was in charge of the guard one night, and a woman comes up with tears in her eyes and says, "My opal, my opal, my opal."</span> <span id="s1456">Well, I went to high school with a couple of girls named Opal.</span> <span id="s1457">Opal Ellenjer.</span> <span id="s1458">And they were German.</span> <span id="s1459">So I'm assuming someone grabbed her daughter, and she's scared to death.</span> <span id="s1460">But she grabbed my hand, and she drags me around and so on so forth.</span> <span id="s1461">Opal is her car.</span> <span id="s1462">So [laughing] someone --</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">Q: Stolen her car.</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">A: -- someone had taken her car and put it into a parking lot.</span> <span id="s1465">The Germans were not initially allowed to have automobiles.</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1467">So they -- okay.</span> <span id="s1468">So she wanted her car back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">A: She wanted her car back -- "my Opal, my Opal, my Opal."</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">Q: Did she get it back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">A: Yeah, I gave it to her.</span> <span id="s1472">I said, "I think the keys are still in it."</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">Q: So you had guard duty; that was amongst the things that you had to do.</span> <span id="s1474">Was that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1475">A: Well, the answer is that "We're occupying Germany."</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1477">But as I said, this is -- what is it that you were doing as part of that effort?</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">A: Well, the answer is that, "We had no idea whether the Germans -- what the German civilians were going to be doing."</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">A: And didn't know whether they were going to be belligerent, whether they were going to try to kill us, or what they were going to try to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">Q: Were you patrolling the streets, for example?</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">Q: Like a policemen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">A: Like a policemen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1486">Okay.</span> <span id="s1487">And how were they actually?</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">A: Actually, they were most gracious.</span> <span id="s1489">The first day he wanted back was their opera opened.</span> <span id="s1490">[laughing].</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">Q: They wanted their opera.</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">A: They wanted their opera opened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1494">And were you in the same place, you know, during these months?</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">Q: In this -- can you tell me the town again -- Mark something?</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">A: Mark M-A-R-K graffin G-R-A-F-F-I-N [sic].</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">Q: Markgraffin outside Munich.</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1500">It was outside Munich.</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">Q: And it's a small town or something?</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1503">Small town.</span> <span id="s1504">They just have -- that's where the Raiders had headquarters.</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">Q: And so, you were patrolling the streets -- you had guard duty.</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">A: We were not only patrolling the streets; we were patrolling the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">Q: So did that mean 'on foot' or did that mean 'by jeep' or did that mean 'both'?</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">A: Oh, no -- by jeep.</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">Q: By jeep -- okay.</span> <span id="s1510">Did you have prisoners that you were guarding as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">A: No, the prison situation was gone -- solved.</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1513">And was there anything eventful in these couple of months?</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">Q: No.</span> <span id="s1516">Were you just waiting to go home?</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">A: Waiting to go to Japan.</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">Q: And what happened [pause] -- to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">A: Well, we had -- we moved people out of their houses, so we were all inside.</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">A: But we didn't have any -- there were very few problems.</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1523">So the anticipated problems never appeared.</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">A: Never really happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1526">When did you get orders to go back to the States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1527">A: To go back where?</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">Q: To the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">A: Well, I was born in May.</span> <span id="s1530">I went back to the United States in either November or December.</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">Q: Half a year later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1533">Q: Did you go home to your mother and sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s1534">A: I went home to my -- as I said, my father was deceased.</span> <span id="s1535">My sister had married -- married a guy in med school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">A: And I was planning on going back to University of West Virginia.</span> <span id="s1538">But I was contacted by Duke University.</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">A: And they offered me a full scholarship --</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">A: -- to go to Purdue.</span> <span id="s1543">So, instead of going to back to University of West Virginia, I went to Purdue and graduated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">Q: Well, did you still go to pre-med, or did you change?</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">A: No, I changed now to economics and engineering.</span> <span id="s1546">My degree is in economics and engineering.</span></p> <p><span id="s1547">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1548">And so, you graduated Duke, and then how did your life -- your career and your life go forward?</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">A: I was highly recruited, and I went with a company called ACF Industries, which basic product was railroad cars.</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">Q: Oh, isn't that funny -- you grow --</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">A: But the thing they want me to do was get -- was be an interface with the government, on government-type contracts.</span> <span id="s1552">So I stayed there for ten years and had planned to spend the rest of my life there.</span> <span id="s1553">And we got a huge contract from the New York Central Railroad -- New York Central Railroad -- and we had a big party in the Waldorff Astoria.</span> <span id="s1554">The day before I was told that I was going to be the youngest vice president in the company.</span> <span id="s1555">And so, that sounded wonderful.</span> <span id="s1556">And we go to Waldorff Astoria, and the president and the chairman and the senior officers, including my boss, from American [?]</span> <span id="s1557">foundry, and their counterparts from New York Central, were in the receiving line.</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">A: And my boss, for reasons never known, goosed -- goosed the president's wife of the New York Central in the receiving line.</span> <span id="s1560">Now, she giggled, so he goosed her again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">Q: [breathing in] Oh!</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">A: Can you believe that?</span> <span id="s1563">The next day the president of American Foundry got a message from the head of the New York Central, "And once that son of a bitch is off the payroll at the end of the day, I want to cancel my order."</span> <span id="s1564">And that was the biggest order that had ever been let in for railroad cars.</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">Q: That was a dumb move; wasn't it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">A: Oh, stupid!</span> <span id="s1567">It was stupid.</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">Q: So what did it mean for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">A: Well, the answer was, "I was on his team."</span></p> <p><span id="s1570">Q: So did that mean you got let go too?</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">A: I wasn't let go, but I knew that -- immediately that my teamster was in doubt, because someone else was going to come in who I didn't know and I didn't fill and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1573">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">A: So his two deputies -- I was one of them -- moved on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">Q: Before we go to that, you left -- you left the United States as a ranger, as a 19-year-old, okay?</span> <span id="s1576">And you come back as a 21-, 22-year-old -- something like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1577">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">Q: How did you change in those years?</span> <span id="s1579">Or did you change in those years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1580">A: My first answer was, "I didn't change at all."</span> <span id="s1581">I mean, I had experienced death.</span> <span id="s1582">But, when I went to Duke, you know, the men that were there who had -- competed -- who had not qualified to be in the military, but most of the classmates -- the men were ex-military just like me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1584">So there wasn't -- you know, when we hear now about people coming back from Iraq, or even it was just Vietnam War -- they came back and had real problems readjusting and had real problems; that wasn't something that you experienced.</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">A: No, I didn't have any problems readjusting.</span> <span id="s1586">I went immediately into it.</span> <span id="s1587">I wasn't looking for employment.</span> <span id="s1588">I immediately had job opportunities.</span> <span id="s1589">And I sure really feel for these guys -- particularly the wounded warriors.</span> <span id="s1590">And I might add that there's all kinds of money missions circulating around these things.</span> <span id="s1591">I get a runner every month asking me for money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1593">[pause] Did you go back to Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">A: In my American -- in my American economy ten years, I went to Spain once.</span> <span id="s1595">They had a fast cargo passenger train which we ran copies of.</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">A: We wanted to make in this country.</span> <span id="s1598">But then later [pause] -- I now was with another company, and they gave me international responsibilities.</span> <span id="s1599">So I started traveling all over the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">Q: What was the company?</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">A: Diagnostic Retrieval Systems -- DRS.</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">Q: DR -- ?</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">A: Diagnostic Retrieval Systems.</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1605">And you note in your biography that you served as vice president of several companies and president of one firm for a total of 60 years.</span> <span id="s1606">What was the firm where you were the president?</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">A: What was the name of the company?</span> <span id="s1608">I had like 1200 employees.</span> <span id="s1609">What was the name of the company?</span> <span id="s1610">I'll have to come up with it.</span> <span id="s1611">I can't think of the name right offhand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">Q: That's okay.</span> <span id="s1613">And kind of like my -- not quite "last question" but close to last question is, you did go to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1614">We're almost done.</span> <span id="s1615">You did go to Auschwitz in 2012; is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">Q: And was this the first time you were in a concentration camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">Q: I assume that by this time --</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">A: This was our eastern Europe trip.</span> <span id="s1621">My wife and I did a lot of traveling.</span> <span id="s1622">We went to China.</span> <span id="s1623">We went to Japan.</span> <span id="s1624">And we went to every place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">Q: So I see that in this eastern European trip, which was in 2011, you were in Berlin, in Prague, in Vienna, in Budapest, in Warsaw, and in Krakow where Auschwitz is close by.</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1628">Was this the first and only concentration camp that you have been in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1629">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1630">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1631">I see the Berlin --</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">A: This is Berlin stadium.</span></p> <p><span id="s1633">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1634">Let's go to the Auschwitz ones.</span> <span id="s1635">Right here.</span> <span id="s1636">I see that in your slide you have -- this is the aerial view of the camp and then some facts from -- and where it's located.</span> <span id="s1637">Some facts about the -- about the camp.</span> <span id="s1638">And what kind of impressions can you share with us about your trip to Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">A: Well, when you're -- looks like.</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">Q: Of course, when you enter, there's a photograph here, which has a couple of buildings that are very old-fashioned.</span> <span id="s1641">And it has a sign by the door "Arbeit macht frei," which means "Work will set you free."</span></p> <p><span id="s1642">A: The reason that Auschwitz was in such a good shape was, it was a former army post, and the buildings were -- the buildings were built to last.</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1644">I see those things -- the ladies and children's latrine, yeah?</span> <span id="s1645">Those were photographs from Europe.</span> <span id="s1646">The barracks for the prisoners.</span> <span id="s1647">Large ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s1648">A: I took all these pictures.</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">Q: You took all these pictures.</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">A: This is unbelievable --</span></p> <p><span id="s1651">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">A: -- to be in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">Q: This was the interior of the gas chamber.</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">Q: And then you took a picture -- or I see here of the cyanide pellet chute, that is where it came through, and the crematorium furnace.</span> <span id="s1656">You took pictures of those things.</span> <span id="s1657">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">A: I would let you borrow this if you send it back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1659">Q: Thank you.</span> <span id="s1660">Thank you very much.</span> <span id="s1661">We'll talk about it at the end.</span> <span id="s1662">But, for right now, I think we're winding up.</span> <span id="s1663">And I'd like to ask -- [laughing] -- one final question.</span> <span id="s1664">And that is -- and this is sort of like a wrap-up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">A: Let me ask you a question first.</span></p> <p><span id="s1666">Q: Sure.</span> <span id="s1667">Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">A: Being a mother of a 19-year-old --</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">A: -- that sounds like a wonderful experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">Q: It is.</span> <span id="s1672">It is a wonderful experience.</span> <span id="s1673">It is, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s1674">A: I congratulate you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">Q: Thank you.</span> <span id="s1676">Thank you.</span> <span id="s1677">What would you want someone like my 19-year-old daughter to understand about your experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">A: I'm torn between not getting her mostly upset and not worrying about it, to where she really ought to understand what happened.</span> <span id="s1679">[pause] The point being is I'm quite comfortable "If she's not going to experience anything like this, so why burden her?"</span></p> <p><span id="s1680">Q: Did you ever kill anybody?</span></p> <p><span id="s1681">A: I refuse to answer that.</span> <span id="s1682">I shot people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1683">Q: Did that weigh on your soul?</span></p> <p><span id="s1684">A: In the rangers -- on mission.</span></p> <p><span id="s1685">Q: Yes, that's what I meant.</span></p> <p><span id="s1686">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">Q: Did that weigh on you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1688">A: You were set up that you either shot somebody or they shot you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">Q: But that's a price that we ask people to pay -- to defend us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1691">Q: Well, one of the reasons we conduct such interviews is so that, when people who are young -- like 19 -- if they do choose to find out about what happened and about what someone's experiences were, they have the possibility of doing so.</span> <span id="s1692">They can choose themselves to learn.</span></p> <p><span id="s1693">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1695">Without having it force-fed.</span> <span id="s1696">So, for that, I'm very grateful that you shared with all of us today.</span></p> <p><span id="s1697">A: We thank the Holocaust Museum -- and by the way, we were initial members when it was formed, but I don't think anyone sends me a bill anymore.</span> <span id="s1698">I don't know whether I belong or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1699">Q: Well, I can talk to our development people [laughing].</span></p> <p><span id="s1700">A: [laughing].</span></p> <p><span id="s1701">Q: So I'm going to say at this point that this concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s1702">A: Well, thank you for coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s1703">Q: From -- with Mr. Roger Neighborgall on May 2, 2014.</span> <span id="s1704">Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">Conclusion of Interview</span></p></body></html>
