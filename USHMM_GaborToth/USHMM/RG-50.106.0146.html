even remember which.</span> <span id="s161">There was one which was very popular at that time, Leon Kalmay [indecipherable] he was pronounced in Germany, Kalmei.</span> <span id="s162">He wrote about American Indians and so on, and he wrote at least 25 books of this type, and th-tha-that -- i-in my childhood was my favorite author.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: Any songs from childhood that you remember?</span> <span id="s164">Any songs?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: No.</span> <span id="s166">I -- I actually don’t remember the kind of songs.</span> <span id="s167">I guess German folk songs.</span> <span id="s168">And then, of course, we -- we knew some Jewish songs, which are popular in this country, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: What were their names, what were their titles?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: The songs?</span> <span id="s171">Th-Th-The well-known Hanukah songs, and that’s all the -- that’s all I remember about the songs.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: [indecipherable] right.</span> <span id="s173">And sports, did you do any kind of physical activity?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: I was very active in that respect.</span> <span id="s175">I loved to play soccer.</span> <span id="s176">Later, when Hitler came to power, all Jewish kids joined -- th-th-they founded Jewish sports clubs because we were not allowed to be members of others.</span> <span id="s177">So that was also a social outlet for all Jewish kids.</span> <span id="s178">So I was very active there.</span> <span id="s179">F-F-Field and track, and soccer I played and I was -- I wa -- I was one of the socc -- soccer players on my team and we traveled every Sunday to -- to towns nearby and played games there.</span> <span id="s180">I was very active as far as sports are concerned.</span> <span id="s181">And I was the -- one of the best athletes in si -- in high school, too.</span> <span id="s182">Was my special ambition because being the only Jew in my class, I -- I excelled in that respect, and I knew that the Germans respected people who were physically active and successful.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: How old were you when you started high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: I was 10 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: So from 10 to 18 y-you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: 19.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: -- 19, you were active in sports.</span> <span id="s188">Did you have any ideas about a future career?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: No, I was not -- because the situation changed all the time.</span> <span id="s190">When the rights were taken away from all Jews, I -- you had less possibilities and chances t-to go to certain schools and universities.</span> <span id="s191">As a matter of fact, shortly after Hitler came to power, Jews could not go to colleges any more, and universities.</span> <span id="s192">So I had to change my professional plans all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: Let’s now talk about when Hitler came into power, unless there’s anything else you wanted to add pre-Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: Pre-Hitler?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: Anything else that you wanted to add about your life then.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: You mean before Hitler came to power?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s200">What is -- okay, so it i -- you were 18 years old -- or 17 and a half when he came into power.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: What is your first recollection of Hitler?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: My first recollection of Hitler is shortly after he came to power, there was a boycott of all Jewish stores, all over Germany.</span> <span id="s204">That me -- it meant that storm troopers stood in front of -- a couple of storm troopers stood in front of all Jewish stores and stopped people from going in.</span> <span id="s205">The -- well, that lasted only a couple of days and then they discontinued that, but it made a deep impression on me that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: Now, when he came into power, you were still in the gymnasium?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: And were there any changes in the beginning among your fellow students and among the faculty when he came in, in the beginning?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: No, in the beginning, hardly any changes took place, this all happened later, very gradually.</span> <span id="s210">So that was one reason why we all thought it might end very suddenly again.</span> <span id="s211">We thought it couldn’t last, that Hitler would be thrown out again, and we thought it only for a short while.</span> <span id="s212">We couldn’t believe that this would stay forever.</span> <span id="s213">But later on of course, it got more serious.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: In the beginning, did you talk things over with your parents about the changes when Hitler came into power?</span> <span id="s215">Were they open with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s217">These were the only people you could talk with about things like them.</span> <span id="s218">We were always very careful to make remarks about Hitler in the Nazi time, so I spoke only to my -- mainly to my family about this.</span> <span id="s219">Actually, my father was not alive any more when Hitler came to power.</span> <span id="s220">My father died in 1927.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: Wh-What did he die from?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: He had a stroke, he was awa-away -- away on vacation and he -- he died of a stroke.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: So did your mother keep the business going?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: My mother kept the business, and her sister joined -- joined her and to ha -- to -- to be helpful to her, and this way they could keep the business going.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: And the bi -- business was successful up til -- up til the Hitler time.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: For the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: For the time being.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: Did you notice any changed attitudes on the part of your non-Jewish friends in early to middle 1933?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: In the beginning there was hardly any change in 1933, but 30 -- ’34, and shortly after that, it slowly changed.</span> <span id="s231">In the beginning I was still very friendly with all of -- we were a class of 25, who stayed together by the way, until the nine years were over, so we -- we were always together.</span> <span id="s232">So I was still very friendly with most -- almost all of them.</span> <span id="s233">And then --</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: This is boys and girls?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: Yes, boys and girls, right.</span> <span id="s236">And they kept on talking to me, we had friendly relations, but slowly they all joined the Hitler youth, the Nazi organization.</span> <span id="s237">And they didn’t stop talking to me, but they were -- they were still more distant.</span> <span id="s238">And slowly this changed too, for the worse.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: What about your teachers?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: My teachers behaved all right.</span> <span id="s241">They didn’t show any anti-Semitism, even actually up to the end when -- when I left.</span> <span id="s242">When I -- when I -- when high school was over.</span> <span id="s243">But I was banned from certain activities in school.</span> <span id="s244">When they were in nationalistic celebrations or national holidays, in -- in which I always had taken part of before, we were banned from these thing -- I was banned from there, which I actually didn’t mind.</span> <span id="s245">I was very happy I didn’t have to take part.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: At this time did you feel very German or very Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: I felt very German in the beginning, but this changed when Hitler came to power, of course, it’s changed completely.</span> <span id="s248">And a-at that time I was of -- felt more Jewish than I had before.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: So w -- do you remember the book burning?</span> <span id="s250">O-Or was there book burning in Fürth?</span> <span id="s251">Was there ba --</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: No, there weren’t any book burnings in Fürth which I was aware of.</span> <span id="s253">I don’t think there were any.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s255">And how aware were you of what was happening in the rest of Germany at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: Actually, we were in an -- in an area of Germany which was very, very Nazi.</span> <span id="s257">Nurem -- we were right next to Nuremberg, which it was the -- the place where every year the Nazi party had a --</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: A rally?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: It was more than a rally, actually.</span> <span id="s260">It was a -- they were -- can almost say a million of -- of storm troopers and all kinds of party members gathered in the -- in Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s261">And of course, being -- Fürth being so close was -- was affected in that way, too.</span> <span id="s262">So the place was full of Nazis every year in fall.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: And what is it like for a young Jewish person to see these men in these uniforms?</span> <span id="s264">What -- what were your -- what were your feelings when you looked at storm troopers and others in military garb?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: Of course we didn’t like it at all and we felt -- we were looking forward to the day -- it last five, six days.</span> <span id="s266">We were looking forward to the day when that was over.</span> <span id="s267">In the beginning we were not actually afraid that something would happen to us, but I -- I know that a couple of Jewish people were beaten up on the street and insulted and that happened, by the way, in other ways, too.</span> <span id="s268">Slowly, 1933 - ’34 - ’35, it got worse, and people were insulted on the streets.</span> <span id="s269">They called us dirty Jews and many times they -- they hit us, especially the young people.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: We-Were you ever attacked?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: I personally was never attacked, but I was insulted a couple of times.</span> <span id="s272">People came over to me and insulted me.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: What kind of things would they say to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: Dirty Jew, and you should get out of Germany and things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: And -- and what would you do when -- when you were insulted?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: There isn’t much you could do, we just try to walk away as fast as we could.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: Well, did you tell your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: Yes, I always told my parents about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: And your mother’s business, did it continue to -- to be in effect after Hitler came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: Yes, it -- it kept on going for awhile, then it got worse and worse because of all the anti-Semitic propaganda in Germany.</span> <span id="s281">Customers stayed away and slowly business got worse.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: Was your mother’s business boycotted?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: Just a -- no, just on that one day in 1933 when there was that German boycott, which covered all of Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: And so you finished school, you finished the gymnasium, and then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: When I was finished I had -- I had to make the decision what to do after it, which was --</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: Le-Let’s back up.</span> <span id="s287">What kind of graduation did you have from the gymnasium?</span> <span id="s288">Was there a ceremony, were you recognized at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: There was no -- no celebration or anything like this.</span> <span id="s290">We -- the one that took place in school, I don’t think I took part of.</span> <span id="s291">Yeah, I remember now.</span> <span id="s292">I was -- I was a member of the s -- of the -- I played piano pretty well, and I accompanied so -- acco -- I was supposed to accompany a couple of singers at the final celebrations at the graduation.</span> <span id="s293">And I was supposed to play two solos, piano solos, and that was in 1933.</span> <span id="s294">So in the last moment I was told that I couldn’t do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: And how does a young man respond to that?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: I was very disappointed, of course.</span> <span id="s297">That was my first chance to perform in public and I was -- I had looked forward to it, so I was disappointed.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: Were you angry?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: I think I was angry, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: What was the reasoning they gave you?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: That due to the political situation, I -- I could not take part in this.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: Were you recognized at all during the graduation ceremony, or were the Jewish students recognized at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: No, being the only Jew in my class, I -- I was the only one.</span> <span id="s304">So of course, they -- they told me that before already.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: How is it that you were the only Jew?</span> <span id="s306">Because of the neighborhood you lived in?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: No, some of the other Jewish kids went to different schools, different high schools, which did not -- which were not humanistic gymnasium.</span> <span id="s308">And it just happened that in my -- in -- in my age group I was the only one.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: What --</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: Can you -- can you excuse me for a second?</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: Sure.</span> <span id="s312">[tape break]</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: When I had to make a choice what to do after high school, i -- it was very hard.</span> <span id="s314">As I said before, you could not -- colleges and universities were not open to you any more.</span> <span id="s315">So I, be-being very much interested in music, I was looking for some activity for something to do in connection with music.</span> <span id="s316">An-And I thought of becoming a cantor in the synagogue.</span> <span id="s317">There was a Jewish teacher’s college in Berlin, and I asked a couple of my -- we had some acquaintances which were -- knew a lot about music and s -- and voice and singing and so on.</span> <span id="s318">So I consulted some of our friends, sang for them, and asked them if -- if they thought my voice was good enough to be a cantor.</span> <span id="s319">So I finally heard of s -- of the Jewish teacher’s college in Berlin.</span> <span id="s320">And -- so, in other words, I would have to be trained as a cantor and as a teacher, mainly as a teacher, of course.</span> <span id="s321">This was a teacher’s college, which specialized, of course, in Jewish education and public school and everything like this.</span> <span id="s322">So I applied for that and I was accepted and started in -- in spring 1936, and I was there for three years in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: Was that hard for you to -- to leave your mother?</span> <span id="s324">She was a widow, did she -- was she positive about your moving, or did she not want you to?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: Now, if she -- if she felt bad about it, she didn't let me know.</span> <span id="s326">Besides that, my sister was still there too, but it was quite a move f-for me, at the age of 19 to go from the small town -- small city to Berlin, which is -- was a city of four million people.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: Had -- after your father died, did you kind of feel like you were the man in the family?</span> <span id="s328">Did you feel a responsibility?</span> <span id="s329">You were only 12 years old when he died.</span> <span id="s330">Wa -- a-after your father passed away --</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: So, what is your question?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: My question is, did you f-feel like you had to be the man in the family because there was no man there?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: No, actually not.</span> <span id="s334">At that time I was too young for that, at 12 years.</span> <span id="s335">I didn’t feel I had any responsibility in that respect.</span> <span id="s336">But there were my uncles of -- there were two uncles of mine living in Fürth, too, who of course w -- tried to help my mother manage things and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: So now you go off to Berlin, an-and what was your experience there at this teacher’s college?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: It was very hard for me in the beginning because I felt very lonesome.</span> <span id="s339">I didn’t know a soul in Berlin, and -- but that’s -- got slowly used to it and I did pretty well in school there.</span> <span id="s340">I had some voice teachers, too.</span> <span id="s341">One was one of the best known cantors in Berlin.</span> <span id="s342">The other one was an opera singer at the Berlin opera.</span> <span id="s343">And they gi -- first one, then the other one gave me singing lessons, so I improved my voice to a certain extent.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: And their names?</span> <span id="s345">The cantor’s name and the singer’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: The cantor’s name was Davidson and the -- the opera singer’s name was Relane Goodman.</span> <span id="s347">He was pretty well known.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: And so you -- you were with all other Jewish students at the time, because this was a Jewish college.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: Right, that was a Jewish college, right.</span> <span id="s350">A Jewish teacher’s college.</span> <span id="s351">Half of it consisted of regular teacher’s cl-classes and teaching.</span> <span id="s352">The other half was Jewish education because we had to teach religion, too.</span> <span id="s353">So I -- I -- a lot, a lot of Hebrew, of course, and everything connected with the Jewish religion, customs and ceremonies.</span> <span id="s354">Some Talmud s-studies we had too, just to give us a taste of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Fred Goldman.</span> <span id="s357">This is tape number one, side B. And you were talking about your experience at this Jewish college in Berlin.</span> <span id="s358">And all the students, of course, were Jewish.</span> <span id="s359">What was it like to study with only Jews, as opposed to your gymnasium experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: It, of course, was a pleasant experience to be together with Jewish kids all the time.</span> <span id="s361">In that respect, I liked it very much.</span> <span id="s362">We were very good friends to each other.</span> <span id="s363">Was a class of about 24 bor -- boys and girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: I imagine you saw many swastikas and many flags hanging, not only in Fürth, but of course in Berlin.</span> <span id="s365">How did that make you feel, to see them?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: No I -- everybody got very f-fast used to that, it was something that you see everywhere, and you di -- after awhile you didn’t even notice it any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s368">And when someone would heil Hitler, did that upset you?</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: The same thing, you got used to that too.</span> <span id="s370">After awhile it didn’t bother you too much any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: Any experiences on the street when you were in Berlin, if you were walking down the street?</span> <span id="s372">Did you look very Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: Yeah, I -- I looked Jewish, of course.</span> <span id="s374">But in -- in the big city of four million, you di-disappeared in the crowd.</span> <span id="s375">And you could do in -- in certain ways it was even better in Berlin than in Fürth, because you could go to the places here still.</span> <span id="s376">In Fürth you couldn’t even go to a swimming pool, or in -- all the -- in -- in the rest of Germany you couldn’t go to a swimming pool, to theaters or movies or any place like this.</span> <span id="s377">In fir -- in Berlin you could do that, because you just disappeared in the crowd.</span> <span id="s378">You could even go to the opera and to concerts.</span> <span id="s379">So in that respect, life in Berlin was easier than in Fürth.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: And how much communication did you have with your mother and your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: I spoke to them on the telephone, I guess once a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: And how were they managing back in Fürth?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: That -- it seems they managed all right without me, but business got worse at that point.</span> <span id="s384">Th-The longer Hitler was at pow -- in power, the worse economic conditions for Jews became.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: And how did your mother support the family then?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: There was still enough business just to barely support us, but it -- I know it was not easy for her to have me in Berlin, of course.</span> <span id="s387">Did not help our financial situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: Did you have to pay tuition to go to this college?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: Yes, I had to pay tuition there.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: What -- and where did you live when you were a student in Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: I lived in a furnished room with a Jewish family, not far from our teacher’s college.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: And what kind of experience was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: I had no special experiences in t -- I mean, they were -- I was pr -- became pretty close to the family, which made it easy for me to be alone in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: You had previously mentioned the Nuremberg rallies.</span> <span id="s395">Did you ever go to any of them, or hear them from a distance?</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: No, you could not go.</span> <span id="s397">You -- you stayed away from them as far as you could.</span> <span id="s398">It never entered our minds to a -- to attend these things.</span> <span id="s399">You stayed away from -- from the -- these Nazi hordes as -- as much as you possibly could.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: Any close Jewish friends that you could talk things over with?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: In Fürth, yes, but a -- a lot of them left Germany, emigrated over the years.</span> <span id="s402">Everybody tried to get out of Germany, of course.</span> <span id="s403">And this way it was not easier.</span> <span id="s404">On one hand you wanted to get out of Germany, on the other hand you didn’t know where to go to -- and especially older people found it very difficult to leave, because all -- they had all their roots in Germany, their livelihoods, their friends, family.</span> <span id="s405">And for a young person, of course, it was easier to leave, unless you were -- of course, you -- you were very attached to your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: Did your family have any contacts in the -- in the United States at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: My mother had a cousin in -- in America, in -- in York, Pennsylvania.</span> <span id="s408">He was a fairly wealthy man and he had vouched for quite a few people already to come to America, but when we asked him he couldn’t do it any more.</span> <span id="s409">He must have vouched for maybe 20 people, and when you reach a certain point, you couldn’t do it any more.</span> <span id="s410">So he had to say no to us in the beginning, but later on, for some reason he could do it again, and he asked -- he asked our family if they -- who -- who should -- he could vouch for one more person, who should come.</span> <span id="s411">And because I was the only man in the family and more in danger of being persecuted by the Nazis, so my family agreed to send -- to let me go.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: We-We’ll get to that in a moment.</span> <span id="s413">You heard about the anschluss into -- into Austria, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: -- what did that mean to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: It didn’t mean much to me except I didn’t -- we didn’t like the idea that something like this could happen.</span> <span id="s417">We -- we thought ma -- there mi -- m-more countries might -- might be occupied by Germany, which actually happened later on.</span> <span id="s418">We saw this the beginning of something very bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: Is that when you realized that what was happening may not be temporary?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: That was the time when -- when most Jews realized that things would not get any -- an-any better any more.</span> <span id="s421">Before we always thought Hitler’s regime might stop any moment it ca -- when it came to a certain point, and it would not get worse.</span> <span id="s422">At that time we realized we couldn’t stay.</span> <span id="s423">That’s when people -- many people really started looking to get out seriously.</span> <span id="s424">Many, of course, had left already in 1933, but these were the Jews who lived in very small towns, in villages, mostly in south Germany and they were worse off than the Jews who lived in b -- in the big cities, because everybody knew everybody and people were beaten up and sent to concentration camps in these small place, much more than b -- in big cities, at that time.</span> <span id="s425">But after this happened at the anschluss and later on Kristallnacht, we came to the conclusion that there was no way of staying here.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: What was your experience during Kristallnacht?</span> <span id="s427">A: In the middle of the night we heard a lot of noise, at maybe two, three o’clock in the morning, and the bra -- the breaking of glass.</span> <span id="s428">And then we looked out of the window, we saw that storm troopers marched all over the place and knocked in store windows and went inside and then they came -- they went upstairs out -- in these houses an-a-and arrested all the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s429">An -- and that -- that happened with each and every Jew in the whole place, and happened all over Germany.</span> <span id="s430">And then they -- they burned all synagogues.</span> <span id="s431">And I knew it -- I could see that our synagogue in Fürth was burning at the time, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: Were you in Berlin or Fürth during Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: I -- I was still in Fürth at that time.</span> <span id="s434">No, that was after I came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: This is November 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: I was back in Fürth already, th -- after my three years in Berlin when the kr -- Kristallnacht was November 9th, 1938, and th-th-they t -- they took us all to a large square in the middle of the city and we had to stand there for five hours, men, women, children, everybody.</span> <span id="s437">Then they let women and children go home.</span> <span id="s438">The men were taken to a big hall, which had been donated by a Jew, by the way.</span> <span id="s439">And we spent all day in there.</span> <span id="s440">And they took men, took them up to the stage an-and beat them.</span> <span id="s441">And we had to watch it, we were sitting underneath, i-inside the hall and we had to watch everything.</span> <span id="s442">And that went on all day like this.</span> <span id="s443">And in the evening, about six, seven o’clock, we all had to pass a certain table, and we were -- there th-th-they decided what to do with us.</span> <span id="s444">So the majority of the men were sent to concentration camps, and to prisons.</span> <span id="s445">My -- my future father-in-law, for instance, was sent to pri -- was taken to prison and many other men were taken to concentration camps.</span> <span id="s446">And when I -- when I passed the table, they heard that I -- that I was almost ready to emigrate, my papers were almost ready.</span> <span id="s447">And they -- on account of that they let me go.</span> <span id="s448">I was very lucky, cause I was able to go home.</span> <span id="s449">But the majority of the people did not.</span> <span id="s450">It’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s452">Le -- le-let’s back up a little bit.</span> <span id="s453">You went to the teacher’s college in Berlin for three years?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: Right, yes, for three years.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: And that -- and then you completed the course, and then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: Then I wa -- I was trying to find a job as a cantor teacher and I -- I had two auditions, I was in two cities in Germany.</span> <span id="s457">And in one place they didn’t take me because I was t -- they found me too young, they wanted some -- somebody who -- who was a little older.</span> <span id="s458">And in the -- in the second case I don’t know, they d-didn’t accept me.</span> <span id="s459">So I went home, then I realized that it -- it was better for me not to accept a job, and try -- rather, try to -- to speed up my emigration.</span> <span id="s460">And that was a good thing, because I know some of the others who accepted jobs as teachers never got out of Germany.</span> <span id="s461">In that respect I was lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: And who did you work through to get the papers?</span> <span id="s463">You said you had that relative who had already completed the 20 affidavits -- i-in the United States, you said you had a relative who had sponsored 20 people, it -- did you work through him also?</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: What do you mean by work for him?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: No, no, work through him.</span> <span id="s466">I mean how -- how did you make arrangements to be able to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: No, he’s -- he’s -- he must have sent a -- a letter to the American consulate in Stuttgart in Germany, and they contacted me and then I was invited to come to the American consulate in Stuttgart, and that was the beginning.</span> <span id="s468">An-And then I tri -- I tried to get -- the-they wanted a certain document, which sort of -- many -- in Germany when you moved, and thi -- it went for anybody, if you moved from one city or town to another one, you had to get permission by police.</span> <span id="s469">And that wa -- didn’t go only for Jewish people, for everybody as th -- might still be the same nowadays, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s470">So, and they told me I needed a certain paper, a declaration that I didn’t owe any money to anybody or the taxes [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s471">And I wrote to Berlin because I had been there before, a-and they -- I didn’t get an answer.</span> <span id="s472">So my da -- emigration depended on -- on this document.</span> <span id="s473">And I wrote three times and never got an answer, so I decided I had to go there in person.</span> <span id="s474">So I made a trip to Berlin and I had to go to the Gestapo building, which everybody dreaded at the time.</span> <span id="s475">Nobody wanted to go there.</span> <span id="s476">So I went in, I -- I -- I met a -- an official there, and he yelled at me right away, he said, what’s the matter with you, are you crazy?</span> <span id="s477">You’re writing three letters to me?</span> <span id="s478">Do you think we have nothing better to do than that?</span> <span id="s479">I feel like sending you to a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s480">And -- and then he said a few more words I forgot, and then he let me go.</span> <span id="s481">But I d -- I didn’t know whether it was okayed or not.</span> <span id="s482">About five days later I got the paper and -- and he -- I had asked for.</span> <span id="s483">It was sent to me by mail.</span> <span id="s484">And that made it possible for me to leave Germany after I had gotten that.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: How -- when did you get this final paper in -- how much before Kristallnacht?</span> <span id="s486">Or had you gotten it before Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: What final paper?</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: That paper you said that you -- you said five days later you received the permission.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: It was after Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: So how did they know, when you came up on Kristallnacht you came up to that table, how did they know that you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: They took my --</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: -- getting permission to go to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: They took my word for it, believe it or not.</span> <span id="s494">So in that respect I didn’t have any problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: Hm.</span> <span id="s496">When you were -- were you with your mother and your sister in the square, or -- y-you said when you were all called up the next day.</span> <span id="s497">Were you standing with her?</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: The women and children were sent -- were let g -- were let go, they le-let -- they send them home.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: But prior to that, were you standing with her?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: Yes, in -- while we were standing in that public square we were together.</span> <span id="s501">And then they -- they said, all women and children go home now, an-and the men have to come with us.</span> <span id="s502">And we were taken to that hall.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: What was your mother’s state of mind then?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: She was very much afraid, she was scared.</span> <span id="s505">When we were taken out of our house, there was ou-our two aunts were along with us, and they -- they gave them the push with the -- with the boots to re -- to -- to make her walk a little faster and things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: And the overall atmosphere there, of the Jews in that square was what?</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: No, people were mu -- very much afraid, of course.</span> <span id="s508">They did not know what they had intended to do with us.</span> <span id="s509">But everybody, I guess, was too much o-occupied with his own problems at that moment, with his own worries.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: And then you came back home to your mother and sister, after they released you.</span> <span id="s511">What did America mean to you at that point?</span> <span id="s512">You were around 23 years old.</span> <span id="s513">What did America mean to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: America didn’t mean too much to me e-except that it was ow -- actually our only hope to get out and to ha -- to escape from all this.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: You knew English by then, you said you had taken English in school.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: Yes, I -- I n -- I knew -- I knew English and in -- by the way, in -- in our teacher’s college, we also had English classes.</span> <span id="s517">When I came back from Berlin I took private English lessons to -- to improve my English.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: By that time I knew I was -- h-hoping that I was going to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: And so did you finally get a job in Fürth before -- obviously before you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: No, in -- in our own synagogue, in our Reform synagogue, I -- they engaged me as a cantor on the high holidays and shortly after.</span> <span id="s522">Our former -- our other cantor emigrated himself, and they didn’t have a cantor, so for maybe two or three months I was the cantor in that -- in our home synagogue at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: And how was the family business doing then?</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: The family business got worse and worse all the time.</span> <span id="s525">Of course, customers didn’t come to us, either because they were anti-Semitic, or because they were afraid to go into Jewish stores.</span> <span id="s526">So it -- it -- and another thing happened, kristall -- a-after Kristallnacht, about one or two days later, we were told to come to th -- to police headquar -- not police headquarters, the city government in -- in city hall, and we were forced to sign papers that we relinquished our houses, our property, our businesses and everything, we had to sign -- we had -- just had to sign it away.</span> <span id="s527">And I remember on the way out when we went home, my mother and I and my sister, some people came down the stairway in the city hall and they were bleeding.</span> <span id="s528">So we asked them what happened.</span> <span id="s529">So they said n-n-not much, we just fell -- fell down the stairway.</span> <span id="s530">But we -- we know that they were -- they were beaten up, but -- they were people who refused to sign, so they forced them this way to sign these papers.</span> <span id="s531">So after that we hel -- we had almost nothing to live on.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: How would you describe your mother’s state of mind?</span> <span id="s533">She was what, probably in her -- was she in her late 40’s, early 50’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: Her 50’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: She was in her 50’s.</span> <span id="s536">How stoic was she?</span> <span id="s537">Would you describe her as a strong woman?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: She must have been a strong woman because the way she reacted and first of all, she had a-all the responsibility for me and my sister and the business.</span> <span id="s539">The business didn’t exist any more after that, but she -- she had to be strong to go through all this the way she did.</span> <span id="s540">She had a lot of help by my aunt, of course, and my uncles.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: When you came back -- so you’re -- she did not have the business after that, or once she had to sign over the ownership, then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: She couldn’t go into the business any more though it was in our b -- in our house, in our building.</span> <span id="s543">And then they -- they tried to sell the merchandise and -- for almost nothi -- for almost nothing, maybe a tenth of what it was worth, or something like that, and she got only part of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: A-And --</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: She was completely impoverished now of course, and I remember sh-she had -- she asked -- had to ask some other relatives of ours for a -- a loan or something like this, at that time.</span> <span id="s546">What she lived on after I -- later, after I left and went to America, I don’t even know.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: So then, how soon after were you able to leave?</span> <span id="s548">How soon after Kristallnacht were you able to leave Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: Kristallnacht was November ninth and I left early in January.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: How did you make those arrangements, which boat and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: I -- I knew some other people who had made the same arrangement, and they -- they helped me, they told me where to go and what to do.</span> <span id="s552">I had to correspond, of course with the -- especially with the American consulate in Stuttgart at that time.</span> <span id="s553">And I contacted the Holland America line for my passage to -- from Holland to New York.</span> <span id="s554">And I know after th -- af -- after it was -- this was paid, there wasn’t really much left for my mother.</span> <span id="s555">I arrived here with 12 dollars in [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: And so your mother gave you the money t-to pay for the passage?</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s558">That was the family money, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: And w-were you in agreement that you should be the one to have left?</span> <span id="s560">Did you agree with that also?</span> <span id="s561">Was that something you felt was the right decision?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s563">Yes, I was in agreement with that.</span> <span id="s564">I really believed the fact that I wa -- being a man I was more in danger than the rest of my family, sister, mother, grandmother, aunts and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s566">So when it came time to leave, what did you take with you?</span> <span id="s567">Did you take anything special?</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: I ha -- I -- I -- e-everything I took along was two suitcases, which I carried in my two hands.</span> <span id="s569">That’s all I -- I could take along.</span> <span id="s570">Though I’d be -- I had intended before to take a lot more, and we had bought a lot before it -- about a year before I left, we had bought a lot of things for me, clothes and ba -- a fan and all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s571">And a -- I’d a -- I -- I couldn’t take all that along, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q: Because they told you you couldn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s574">They told us that time that that’s all you could take along, just what you could carry with your hands.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: Besides clothes, what did you take?</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: That was about all I could take, clothes.</span> <span id="s577">There wasn’t much more left.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: So, could you take any music, any instruments?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: No, I could not take any instruments along, but a couple of music books I think I took along.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: Family photographs?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: Very few.</span> <span id="s582">And that was something I really missed very much, but later on, when I was in America, I -- I had ways of getting some pictures, which I hadn’t --which I missed very much and which I didn't have.</span> <span id="s583">So I was able to get some of these pictures [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: What was it like to say goodbye to your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: It was very, very hard because at that time I -- I -- I was afraid I would never see them again, which really happened.</span> <span id="s586">I ho -- my whole family died in concentration camps, each and every one of them.</span> <span id="s587">I was the only survivor of my family.</span> <span id="s588">The same with my wife, by the way, too.</span> <span id="s589">She lost her whole family.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: Where did you leave from?</span> <span id="s591">A-After you left Fürth, where did you then go?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: My -- my boat left -- I had to go to Rotterdam, Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: H-How did you get there?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: By train.</span> <span id="s595">And I’ll never forget the moment when I crossed the border.</span> <span id="s596">It was so -- such a relief.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: An-Any trouble on the train up to the border?</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: No, I didn’t have any trouble, but I know that many other people did.</span> <span id="s599">They had trouble when they -- when they crossed the border.</span> <span id="s600">I didn’t have any problems in that respect.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: What were your thoughts upon leaving Germany?</span> <span id="s602">What were your thoughts upon leaving Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: Good riddance, I guess.</span> <span id="s604">And then, of course I had to -- I felt very bad of my family.</span> <span id="s605">Even I didn't know at the time yet what would really happen to them, but I didn’t have much hope.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: And you got to Rotterdam and got on what boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: It was a Dutch ship, Zaandan, Z-a-a-n-d-a-n.</span> <span id="s608">There wa -- that was a ship belonging to the hum -- to Holland America line; it was one of the smaller ships.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: Did you know anybody als -- who was going with you, or were y -- was anybody else that you knew that was accompanying you?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: No, I befriended a young man from a town near ours.</span> <span id="s611">We be -- spent all our time together on the ship.</span> <span id="s612">When we ar -- we ar -- we arrived in New York and said goodbye to each other and the same evening we both lived in the same apartment, by sheer accident.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: Tell me about the voyage going over.</span> <span id="s614">Who else was on the boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: It was without any incidents, it was pleasant.</span> <span id="s616">It was a completely different life all of a sudden, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: And so you ha -- you stayed in a cabin and had regular meals.</span> <span id="s618">How long was th-the voyage?</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: I think eight days, if I remember right.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s621">And your first view of New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: It was very -- I was very much impressed when I saw New York.</span> <span id="s623">I didn’t have to go to Ellis Island, that was not in use any more at that time, and I was processed ou-outside New York City, on the boat.</span> <span id="s624">An immigration agent came on board -- an immigration inspector came on board and took care of our papers and everything, so I didn’t have to go to Ellis Island or any -- any other place like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: Were there many other Jewish refugees like you on board?</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: There were a few more, yes.</span> <span id="s627">And then, of course, this young man an -- whom I befriended.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: So who were the other passengers?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: This I re -- I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s630">I -- I --</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q: Di-Di-Did you stay among the other Jewish refugees?</span> <span id="s632">Were they young people like you?</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: Yeah, there were some others like me, but not -- not too many.</span> <span id="s634">Must have been regular travelers, people who do a lot of traveling.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Q: Did you talk about your chil -- your -- your background with the other young Jewish refugees?</span></p> <p><span id="s636">A: Yes, I certainly did.</span> <span id="s637">We all compared out experiences.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: Were they all from Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: Yes, they were all from Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: And what was it like to put your foot down on American soil when you first arrived?</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: It was a wonderful moment, I remember that.</span> <span id="s642">And I -- then I looked, of course -- I had relatives in New York who were supposed to pick me up from the boat, and I had trouble finding them, so I -- my -- I couldn't pay much attention to anything else, but I finally found them, and they had arranged for a -- a place for me to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: They had come down to the pier to meet you?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: Right.</span> <span id="s645">They came -- they came to meet me at the boat and they took me home.</span> <span id="s646">And they had fren -- rented a furnished room for me in New York, and that’s the place where -- where the other friend of mine also showed up at the same day.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: But what was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: Kurt Hirschfeld -- Hirschfield.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: And so then what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: Then I tried looking for a job, and at that time it wasn’t so easy.</span> <span id="s651">It was still the e -- the depression going on at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: We’re talking about January 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: There was still a depression.</span> <span id="s654">That was the end of the depression, and it was very hard to find jobs at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: And you’re 23 and a half years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: Right, yes.</span> <span id="s657">And first of all I tried to find a job as a cantor.</span> <span id="s658">I never expected to get a job as teacher because of my heavy German accent, so I never expected to find that.</span> <span id="s659">But as a cantor I had some hope.</span> <span id="s660">But it just happened that at that time all the European cantors arrived in New York City in those years, and then there was a lot of competition.</span> <span id="s661">And I -- I auditioned in a couple of places, in a couple of synagogues, but I guess the competition was too strong.</span> <span id="s662">So then I looked for any kind of a job, and I -- I found job in a department store as a -- as a busboy.</span> <span id="s663">That’s Klein Union Square, that was a pretty well known place in New York.</span> <span id="s664">There were many other refugees working there too, and I had to do the basic things, I had to pick up dre-dresses which fell down to the floor by the hundreds, and brought -- did stock work and all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Fred Goldman.</span> <span id="s667">This is tape number two, side A, and you were talking about your experience working at Klein’s on Union Square.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: So I stayed there for awhile.</span> <span id="s669">By the way, we were paid 30 cents an hour and we ha-had to work 48 hours a week at -- and a lot of overtime.</span> <span id="s670">Whenever they had a sale on for the next day, they kept us until 12, one o’clock at night.</span> <span id="s671">It was forced overtime.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: How -- how close were you living to the store?</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: About 45 minutes by subway.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: And wh-what did you do in the time that you weren’t working?</span> <span id="s675">What activities did you do in the time that you weren’t working?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: When I was not working?</span> <span id="s677">I looked for some other kind of work [indecipherable] and I -- I worked in a -- I was hired in a professional choir, I sang.</span> <span id="s678">It was a Jewish choir.</span> <span id="s679">We sang at special Jewish occasions and we sang carnedi-- Carnegie Hall and in the Russian tea room, and at the World’s Fair, and all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s680">And we had rehearsals almost every night in addition to my regular work.</span> <span id="s681">And concerts maybe every two weeks or so, and we got even paid for the rehearsals, one dollar a rehearsal.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: What was the name of the choir that you sang in?</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: Vinaver choir.</span> <span id="s684">V-i-n-a-v-e-r.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: Was that someone’s name, or was that the name of the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: That was the name of the man who do -- was in charge of the choir, the conductor and the one who did the whole thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: And what kind of communication did you have with your mother and sister once you got to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: With my mother and sister?</span> <span id="s689">In the beginning, of course, we corresponded all the time, but then -- then the war broke out and once America entered the war we could not write to them then, we could not write to each other any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: Let’s talk about September ’39, when the war broke out.</span> <span id="s691">How did you hear about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: When the war broke out with England, you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: No, no, in -- when Germany invaded Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: Wa -- i -- from that time on we could not write any more.</span> <span id="s695">We could write only Red Cross letters, and that happened -- we couldn’t do that too often, so I had very few letters from them, actually.</span> <span id="s696">My sister also tried to get -- tried to go to England.</span> <span id="s697">There was a possibility for a young woman to get -- to go to England as a -- as a domestic h-helper, and she got a job like this.</span> <span id="s698">But three days before the war -- no, she was supposed to go there and begin -- in the beginning of September the war broke out, and -- about three days before she would have gone, so she -- she couldn’t go.</span> <span id="s699">And the same o -- a similar thing happened to her later on, she was in the concentration camp, she was in Bergen-Belsen and three weeks before the war ended, she died of typhus, before she would have been liberated by the British.</span> <span id="s700">So she missed two chances.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: So Germany invades Poland, and then what do you -- you stay at your work?</span> <span id="s702">What -- what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: I kept on doing the same work, then when -- when the war broke out, I got a job in a -- in a uniform factory.</span> <span id="s704">They make uniforms for the American forces, and I had a job which was a little better.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: In other words, you stayed there til -- til Pearl Harbor, is that what you’re saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: So 1939 and ’40 and ’41, you stayed at the department store.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: Right, and then I -- th-then I -- I was drafted to the -- into the army and spent three years in the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: And did you think about becoming a citizen?</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: Yes, I became a -- I -- as a matter of fact I became a citizen [indecipherable] a short time after I entered the army, which was a little fa -- a little earlier than it would have been if I had not been in the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: So the war broke out, des -- on December seventh, and then you said you went to work in a factory making uniforms.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: Right, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: And then when did you go into the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A: I went into the army in March ’43.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: And did you have any kind of social life when you were living in New York, while you were working at the department store or in the uniform factory?</span> <span id="s716">Were you with other young people?</span> <span id="s717">Any kind of social life besides the choir?</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: Yes, I -- yes I -- th -- first of all I met my f -- my fu -- my wife there.</span> <span id="s719">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: How -- how did you meet your wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: I met her by accident on the street, I -- I knew her.</span> <span id="s722">She was also from Fürth, and by accident we met on the street and we got married about nine months later or so, 10 months later, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: Did you know that she had left Fürth and come to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: No, I didn’t -- I didn’t even know that.</span> <span id="s725">So I was very much surprised to see her and we were both very happy because it was a -- a memory of our old days, which meant a lot at that time.</span> <span id="s726">And we bo -- we were both alone in New York, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: But what was she doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: She worked in a -- in a -- she did household work.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: And -- and her name then?</span> <span id="s730">Her name then?</span> <span id="s731">A: Ruth Schuster.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: And her family was back in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A: Her family was back in Germany too, right, in Fürth.</span> <span id="s734">And they all perished too, later on, each and every one of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: So you just met her on the street, just by chance?</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: We met by chance on the street.</span> <span id="s737">We made a date for the same night.</span> <span id="s738">We both had other dates and we b-b-broke them both.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: Did she live near you, is that how you happened to meet her on the street?</span></p> <p><span id="s740">A: No, she -- I lived in uptown Manhattan, she lived in midtown Manhattan, something like this.</span> <span id="s741">About half an hour away by subway.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s743">Whereabouts were you living?</span> <span id="s744">Where were you living?</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: I lived in Washington Heights, it’s the northern part of Manhattan.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s747">And then you got married, and you said nine months later, and then where did you live then?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: And we lived in -- also in -- in Washington Heights, in u-upper Washington Heights, in a different part.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: And -- and you both continued to work at your same jobs, and then you said you went to work on the uniform factory, and then you got drafted.</span> <span id="s750">And where did you start your training?</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: I was -- I -- in Fort Dix, New Jersey, like everybody else and we were all classified -- we were supposed to be classified according to our f -- our previous experiences and then -- and professions.</span> <span id="s752">So I told them I had a Master’s degree in education and what I did before and all that.</span> <span id="s753">And then when they heard I worked in the department store as a floor boy, they classified me as a laborer, but they -- they did write down that I spoke German.</span> <span id="s754">So I -- I became a member of the medical corps, and was about to be sent overseas to the Pacific in the field hospital, and two weeks before I was supposed to ship out, I was reclassified.</span> <span id="s755">They found out that I speak -- they finally noticed that I speak German and I ba -- I became a member of military intelligence.</span> <span id="s756">I -- I went to fort -- to a camp in -- in Maryland, near Hagerstown, Camp Ritchie, which was a t -- a training camp for military intelligence, not only for German speaking, but for other languages too.</span> <span id="s757">And I -- I -- I went to school there for a couple of months.</span> <span id="s758">I was promoted from private to staff sergeant after I -- when I graduate from the -- from there.</span> <span id="s759">And then I went to -- I was sent to Europe to interrogate war prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: What was it like to put on an American uniform?</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: Oh, I was very proud of that, I really enjoyed that.</span> <span id="s762">I was very happy about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: What did it mean to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: Then I re -- I really realized that I was an American, more than before.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Q: So you had to leave your wife then.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Q: Was that difficult?</span></p> <p><span id="s768">A: It was difficult, but I -- I was al -- always hoping to -- to be able to go home every couple of weeks you know, and -- and to furlough a -- a day off.</span> <span id="s769">And I was sent to -- first I was -- but that was before I was in military intelligence, I was in th -- in the -- in a camp right outside New York City.</span> <span id="s770">I’m just trying to remember the name of that.</span> <span id="s771">It was ha -- Halloran Hospital on Staten Island.</span> <span id="s772">And they needed me there because they had a lot of German prisoners, and I had to work as an interrogat -- as a interpreter and I had to go around with nurses and doctors, had to make the rounds when they saw the patients.</span> <span id="s773">They used me as an interpreter.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q: Who were the patients?</span> <span id="s775">Who were these patients?</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: They were German prisoners from Africa.</span> <span id="s777">They were members of the Africa corps.</span> <span id="s778">These were all fanatics -- fanatical Nazis who were volunteers.</span> <span id="s779">And of course w -- being prisoners they changed their attitudes very much, were not so fanatical any more.</span> <span id="s780">And they depended a lot on me, of course, so was -- they very ni -- were very nice to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: Did you let them know you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: No.</span> <span id="s783">They didn’t even know that I was German.</span> <span id="s784">They -- when they asked me where I learned my German I told them I learned it in high school and they were satisfied with that.</span> <span id="s785">They didn’t question it for a moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: And how did you feel inside looking at these German soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s787">A: I hated them, of course, and I -- I -- I used them for certain purposes.</span> <span id="s788">I was able to go home almost every night to -- to Manhattan, and I came home at two, three o’clock in the morning, I was always tired.</span> <span id="s789">Of course, I had to get up at 5:30 again.</span> <span id="s790">So there were a lot of empty beds.</span> <span id="s791">So I rested on these -- I slept on these beds, and I put these German soldiers in -- up as guards on both ends of the -- of -- of the room in case my own people came and checked on me.</span> <span id="s792">So they guarded my sleep.</span> <span id="s793">So I -- I -- I took advantage of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q: Had you changed your name at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: Not at this point but later on when I was in military intelligence, I was advised to change my name because my family was still supposed to be alive, or at least I did not know any different.</span> <span id="s796">I thought I’m di -- in case I’d become a prisoner, it might be harmful for them or even for -- and for me too.</span> <span id="s797">They advised me to change my name.</span> <span id="s798">So within one day I re -- changed my name.</span> <span id="s799">I didn't know what to changed it to -- what to change it to.</span> <span id="s800">So I took a telephone book and the -- the first name I ran into was Stevens.</span> <span id="s801">So I changed my name to Fred Stevens.</span> <span id="s802">At the same time my name -- my wife’s name was Goldman.</span> <span id="s803">Who -- we both had different names at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Q: So -- so -- but up to that point you had been Siegfried Goldman?</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: And then --</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: Then I was Fred Stevens.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: Then you became Fred Stevens.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: Sar -- Sergeant Fred Stevens.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: And -- and then you said you were sent abroad?</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: Then I was sent to -- to the European theater [indecipherable] Germany.</span> <span id="s812">First to fr -- to England and France and then I -- to France for the front lines, and I had to interrogate war prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: These are German prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A: German prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Q: And -- and again, what was your re-response, your reaction?</span></p> <p><span id="s816">A: Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: And again, what was your reaction when you talked to these German soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A: In the beginning it was a strange experience, but later on I got used to that too.</span> <span id="s819">And I -- whenever I had a chance, I tried to get information from these prisoners about what happened to the Jews, to -- to th -- to European Jews under -- under Hitler, and -- but they couldn’t tell me much.</span> <span id="s820">One of them was from Theresienstadt and -- and later on I found out my mother actually was at Theresien -- maybe -- I think I knew it already, at that time.</span> <span id="s821">I had a Red Cross letter.</span> <span id="s822">That was the last letter I ever -- I ever got from my mother, from Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s823">And just one soldier was from Theresienstadt, so I tried to find out as much as I could, but he didn’t know much, either.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Q: How did it feel to go back to Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A: I had mixed feelings about it, of course.</span> <span id="s826">I hated the people, of course, and especially these German soldier I got in touch with.</span> <span id="s827">And that was my main feeling, actually, about it.</span> <span id="s828">Actually, the feelings were not mixed.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: Did you tell other people about that?</span> <span id="s830">Di -- were the other army personnel that you came in contact, aware of your background?</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: N-Not normally, but I remember one instance at the end -- near the end of the war when everything moved very fast and we marched through Germany -- I mean, I didn’t march, we dr-drove through Germany.</span> <span id="s832">Be -- we went through the -- the small town in -- in south Germany where my -- my grandfather was born.</span> <span id="s833">So I told my fellow Americans that we are going through the town where my grandfather was born.</span> <span id="s834">I remember I -- I -- I told them that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">Q: But they knew about your background?</span></p> <p><span id="s836">A: I hadn’t told them about it before, but they were not too interested in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: So most people thought you were born in America?</span></p> <p><span id="s838">A: I don’t know what my -- what my American f-fellow soldiers thought at that -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s839">But the Germans I got in c -- in contact with during the year or so I spent in Germany, they all thought I was -- I d -- I did not tell them that I came from Germany.</span> <span id="s840">I told them the English I know I learned in high school and they believed it, strange enough as it sounds.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: So where were you in -- in Germany?</span> <span id="s842">Where were you stationed?</span></p> <p><span id="s843">A: I was all over Germany, we -- I -- I came from France, from Alsace.</span> <span id="s844">We crossed the Rhine and then we went to south Germany, but that was in the -- near the end of the war.</span> <span id="s845">As a matter of fact we came to the point when interrogations of prisoners were -- was not even necessary any more.</span> <span id="s846">They cou -- they could not -- they didn’t need any more interrogations.</span> <span id="s847">It was -- it was nearing the end and everything moved so fast that it wasn’t necessary to get information from them.</span> <span id="s848">So they used me for different purposes.</span> <span id="s849">I was -- became a member of a task force, we had to interrogate pri -- civilians about certain -- about Nazis, big Nazis.</span> <span id="s850">Where they were located and -- and factories where -- where they manufactured war materials, where they were trying to -- to build an A bomb and things like that.</span> <span id="s851">They were all secret targets which we had to visit.</span> <span id="s852">So we -- we tr -- we traveled around in teams of six each and o-of course I had to interpret for y -- for the officers who -- who -- who questioned these people.</span> <span id="s853">Oh, I did some of -- some of my own interrogating, too.</span> <span id="s854">And we found it -- some important places.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Q: What can you tell -- what can you say now, 50 - 60 years later?</span> <span id="s856">Wh-When you say you found important places, such as?</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: No, th-they were hidden places where they -- where the Germans di -- did a -- experimented with certain things.</span> <span id="s858">Chemicals and a-a-all the way, I guess, trying to -- to find an -- an -- an atomic bomb, to build an atomic bomb.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: And then you would relay this message to your superiors?</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A: Yes, I did, yes.</span> <span id="s861">I wrote reports of what we saw and what we found.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: Do you remember where these places were, where they worked on these?</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: No, I don’t know -- remember any spe -- any particular places.</span> <span id="s864">Then a -- then I -- I wound up in a -- in a camp near Frankfurt where a lot of -- that was at the -- a-after the end of the war already, when -- where they kept a lot of high German officials and officers, generals and admirals and so on, near ha -- near Hamburg.</span> <span id="s865">And then they put me on -- then I had to work on documents di -- di -- that was already in preparation for the war crime trials in Nuremberg later on.</span> <span id="s866">So I wrote for a couple of weeks on documents as I had to find out which documents they might be able to use, which might be important to them.</span> <span id="s867">So I -- I had to -- to ma -- make decisions what might be necessary for the war crime trials and whatnot.</span> <span id="s868">That was very interesting work and I liked that.</span> <span id="s869">I had a couple of people working under me who did the same work and a -- I was in charge of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Q: When -- before the end of the war, when you were moving around Germany, did you see any Jewish refugees?</span> <span id="s871">Did you come across any of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: No, I -- I -- I found I -- we were in -- in a couple of small -- of these small labor camps where they kept j -- especially in south Germany they had lots of them.</span> <span id="s873">They actually belonged to the big concentration camps, they were branches.</span> <span id="s874">And they were small camps, strictly for -- for forced labor, and some of them were all Jewish.</span> <span id="s875">So I -- in -- in two cases I was the first Jewish American soldier who -- who entered them.</span> <span id="s876">And they were very happy to see me.</span> <span id="s877">I tol -- I told them of course that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s878">In one camp I remember they -- they begged me I should -- I should protect their camp commander who was f -- who was very good to them, protected them, and they asked me to protect him.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Q: Were you able to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A: I passed on the information I had.</span> <span id="s881">That’s all I could do at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">Q: What was the name of the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s883">A: I don’t remember that.</span> <span id="s884">They were small camps, I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">Q: In -- in what area?</span></p> <p><span id="s886">A: That was in ba -- in Bavaria in south Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q: How did you feel, here you, thank goodness was able to get out of Germany, and now you come back and you see these Jews who were not able to get back -- get out.</span> <span id="s888">How -- ho -- what does that feel like?</span></p> <p><span id="s889">A: At what point?</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Q: When you said you were in the army and you were talking to these Jewish people in the labor camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A: Then it was much later already and it was at -- near -- that was shortly after the end of the war.</span> <span id="s892">We were, in a -- in a way the army of occupation.</span> <span id="s893">We were actually [indecipherable] military government already at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Q: But my question was, how did you feel inside?</span> <span id="s895">Did you feel an affinity for these people, a connection to these people?</span> <span id="s896">A: No, not at all.</span> <span id="s897">For the Germans, you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s898">Q: No, no, no, for the Jewish --</span></p> <p><span id="s899">A: Oh yeah, certainly.</span> <span id="s900">I tried to help them in any way I could.</span> <span id="s901">I’m -- I met som -- a lot of these DPs later on, who lived in Germany shortly after the war and I did anything I could for them.</span> <span id="s902">By the way, I also met my -- my brother-in-law after the end of the war when I came -- I came back, I went back to Fürth i-in the end -- the war was over in -- in May, and in June or July I -- I got myself a pass from my commander to go back to my hometown to see i-if -- by a sheer miracle maybe some of my relatives came back.</span> <span id="s903">And I went to military government in Fürth and they told me that -- that my brother-in-law had come back from a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s904">So of course I -- I visited him right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q: Th-This is your wife’s brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s906">A: My wife’s brother, right, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">Q: And his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s908">A: I’m sorry, no, it was not my wife’s brother, it was my sister’s husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">Q: Whe-When had your sister gotten married?</span></p> <p><span id="s910">A: Shortly before -- before th -- she was deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q: And what was -- what was his name?</span> <span id="s912">Do you remember your sister’s husband’s name?</span> <span id="s913">A: Paul Seligman.</span> <span id="s914">Paul Seligman was his name.</span> <span id="s915">And I -- I was able later to get him to America.</span> <span id="s916">I could give an -- give an affi -- affidavit for him, and not long already, 1946, I think it was.</span> <span id="s917">Sorry.</span> <span id="s918">In the meantime he died.</span> <span id="s919">He is not alive any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">Q: And you stayed in Germany after the war, you said, working on documents and preparing for the n --</span></p> <p><span id="s921">A: You mean with the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Q: With the army, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">A: Right, yes.</span> <span id="s924">That’s when I did this kind of work, and selecting the ma -- the documents which I mentioned before, which they were able to u -- or supposed to use later on in the war crime trials.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: Were they used?</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: This I don’t know.</span> <span id="s927">I -- I have no way of knowing that.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Q: Where did you go when you came back to Fürth?</span> <span id="s929">You said you saw your -- your brother-in-law, but what -- did you go back to your family home and the family store?</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: No, I -- I passed it, of course, I saw it, but I -- when I came to Fürth I -- I checked in with some American outfit and I slept with the other soldiers in the same barracks.</span> <span id="s931">Mostly factories or things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">Q: Did this feel like your home?</span> <span id="s933">Did this town feel like your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: No, not at all, it did not feel like my home -- my home at all, in any way.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q: And ho -- and then you went back.</span> <span id="s936">You left Fürth and went back to your headquarters and then how long did you stay?</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: No, I went back a couple -- I went back a couple of more times, because my -- as long as my brother-in-law was still there, I visited him and brought him food because he needed many things, clothes and food.</span> <span id="s938">My wife sent him care packages all -- every week until he came to America himself.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s940">And then how long did you stay in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s941">A: I stayed in Europe until March 1946, so I was in the army exactly three years.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q: And then you came back?</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: Then I came back, right.</span> <span id="s944">Then I had to find a new son -- a -- a new activity, some profession.</span> <span id="s945">Somebody recommended diamond setting.</span> <span id="s946">So I took a -- the G.I. course in diamond setting and became a diamond setter.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Q: This is while you were in -- in other words, under the G.I. Bill?</span> <span id="s948">You mean you to --</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s950">That course I took was under th-the G.I. Bill of Rights.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s952">And you started to work in that field?</span></p> <p><span id="s953">A: Yes, a-after the end of that course, which took about a year, I -- I worked in that field and I did that until my retirement.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Q: And did you have any children?</span></p> <p><span id="s955">A: I had two children, right here.</span> <span id="s956">A bo -- a boy and a girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">Q: And th -- were they born in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s958">A: They were both born in New York, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">Q: And -- and when were they born?</span></p> <p><span id="s960">A: My daughter was born in 1948, my son in fi -- ’56.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">Q: And their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s962">A: My daughter’s name is Marian.</span> <span id="s963">My son’s named Jack.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s965">Are they named after anybody in the family?</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A: Yes, we used the initials.</span> <span id="s967">My mother’s name was Meta, th -- Marian.</span> <span id="s968">And my son after my father, who was also Jacob.</span> <span id="s969">Ja -- Jack and Jacob, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">Q: Right, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s971">So you stayed in the diamond setting business in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s972">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s973">I did something else.</span> <span id="s974">I -- I became an organist.</span> <span id="s975">I had started already when I -- when I was in Berlin, in the Jewish teacher’s college, I had taken a course in organ playing already.</span> <span id="s976">And when I -- when I was back in New York later on, somebo -- somebody o-offered me this job in the synagogue in Washington Heights.</span> <span id="s977">So I -- I trained myself actually.</span> <span id="s978">I’m -- I’m partly self taught when it comes to the organ.</span> <span id="s979">But I was able to get this job and later on I improved myself because I went to a bigger synagogue.</span> <span id="s980">So I had the side income for a long time as an organist, for 35 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">Q: And how long did you stay in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s982">A: Until 12 years ago -- 18 years ago.</span> <span id="s983">Eighte -- 18 years ago we moved here, to Silver Spring.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Q: And what brought you here?</span></p> <p><span id="s985">A: My children.</span> <span id="s986">They were both living in Washington, in the Washington area.</span> <span id="s987">My daughter -- my son-in-law worked for the state department.</span> <span id="s988">He was in the -- in the diplomatic corps.</span> <span id="s989">He went -- he went to Chile, and worked there in the -- in the American embassy.</span> <span id="s990">And my -- my son, I-I don’t even remember for what reason, he moved to -- to Washington.</span></p> <p><span id="s991">Q: And do you have any grandchildren?</span></p> <p><span id="s992">A: I have six grandchildren, three from each one.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">Q: And so now you’ve been retired?</span></p> <p><span id="s994">A: I’m retired since -- yeah.</span> <span id="s995">I retired when I was 68, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">Q: Do you do anything with your music now?</span></p> <p><span id="s997">A: No, except give piano lessons.</span> <span id="s998">I gave piano lessons to my gra -- each and every one of my six grandchildren.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">Q: Do you th -- d-do you feel very German today, and -- well, do you feel very German and what are your thoughts about Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">A: I never felt very German in my life, because when I see what happened to Jews who became too attached to one country, I -- I thought it’s not a good thing to be very patriotic.</span> <span id="s1001">But later on I -- I -- I felt differently about America, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q: Did your -- did your children when they were growing up ask you a lot of questions about your childhood, and what had happened to you and why you came here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">A: Yes, they were very interested.</span> <span id="s1004">My grandchildren, too.</span> <span id="s1005">And two years ago I started to write my memoirs and I’m st -- I’m still not completely finished with it, with the purpose, of course, to sh -- to le-let my grandchildren -- my children and grandchildren read it.</span> <span id="s1006">As much as I told them about my -- my past, there were many things, of course, I didn’t remember, and this way I wanted to gi -- give them more to know about my past.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Fred Goldman.</span> <span id="s1009">This is tape number two, side B.</span> <span id="s1010">You were talking about how you’ve written down your memoirs for your children and your grandchildren and -- and many of the details are c-coming back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">A: What did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">Q: And you said you wanted -- you wanted to tell them the fuller story, that many of the details have come back to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">A: The reason for my -- for writing my memoirs was to give them a more detailed story of my past.</span> <span id="s1014">It was the main reason why I did this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">Q: Why is that important?</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: I think it’s very important that they know what happened to me.</span> <span id="s1017">In a way I felt it was my duty to let them know about my past.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">Q: Do you feel that you would be a different person if you hadn’t gone through the experiences that you did?</span> <span id="s1019">Did those experiences shape you?</span> <span id="s1020">Your experience under Nazism, having to leave your family, start a new life?</span> <span id="s1021">If you hadn’t had to go through that, do you think you would have been a different person today?</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">A: Yeah, I think so.</span> <span id="s1023">I’m almost sure that I -- my -- my life was shaped by -- by what happened to me, and my experiences and what I saw in my life.</span> <span id="s1024">It must have had a bi -- a big influence on my -- on my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">Q: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">A: Living i-i-in Nazi Germany for six years certainly must have done a lot to me which ma -- otherwise would not -- would not have done anything.</span> <span id="s1027">Would not have happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: Did it make you more fearful?</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: In the beginning, yes.</span> <span id="s1030">It did make me more fearful.</span> <span id="s1031">When we ca -- when I came here, and my wife told me the same -- that happened to many German refugees who came at that time, we didn’t even speak loud.</span> <span id="s1032">We were -- were not used to speaking th -- in the normal way.</span> <span id="s1033">We whispered.</span> <span id="s1034">And th -- and this went on for quite awhile and it took me a long time and I’m sure it must have happened to others, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">Q: Because you didn’t want other people to hear you speaking German, is that it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">A: No, because we were always afraid in Germany to speak loud, that Nazis didn’t hear what we were talking -- saying to each other.</span> <span id="s1037">So we got used to s -- to speaking very softly.</span> <span id="s1038">Now one thing I would like to tell you in that respect.</span> <span id="s1039">My daughter complained to us when she was an adult already that she -- she was influenced very much by our behavior.</span> <span id="s1040">She -- she -- she must have felt how sad we were and she feels that this influenced her life very much so.</span> <span id="s1041">And later on we asked our son i-if he had the same experience and he said no, because this was already six years later and he was not so mu -- we were not as much influenced by our past any more six years later, than she was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">Q: And how did that affect her?</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">A: It made her sad, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">Q: And how did you explain to your children that they had no extended relatives?</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">A: They know -- they know why.</span> <span id="s1046">They never -- they never knew what it means to have a -- a grandparent, for instance.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: How old were they when you explained what really happened to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: Certainly not -- not too early.</span> <span id="s1049">They must have been in their teens by that time, or maybe a little earlier when we told them all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">Q: And how did they take that knowledge?</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A: They took it as a matter of fact.</span> <span id="s1052">I mean, they -- they took it as a fact.</span> <span id="s1053">They met some other people, the -- older people who took the place of their grandparents.</span> <span id="s1054">They became grandparent figures for them, and they almost considered them as grandparents.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">Q: Were these other German refugees?</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">A: Yes, they were, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">Q: So when you and your wife were starting out in life together, were your friends other German refugees, or Americans?</span> <span id="s1058">Who did you s-spend your time with?</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">A: They were mostly -- they were mostly German refugees too, in our earlier years.</span> <span id="s1060">Later on of course, this was different.</span> <span id="s1061">Now our fre -- we have mixed friends, all types, but at that time, we lived in -- in an -- in areas where there mo -- were mostly refugees, like in Washington Heights in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">Q: So your children grew up knowing other German refugee people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">A: Yes, they did, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1065">Are there any sights today or sounds today that you hear or you see that trigger memories of Nazi Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">A: Yes, there are.</span> <span id="s1067">You -- you -- you see movies, for instance, of that area.</span> <span id="s1068">Confer -- con -- like, you know, wh-where concentration camps were pictured, and …there are all kinds of things which remind you.</span> <span id="s1069">Sometimes books you read, magazines you see.</span> <span id="s1070">My wife seems to be more sensitive to this than I am.</span> <span id="s1071">My wife would never go back to Germany, for instance.</span> <span id="s1072">Many other refugees have been invited to go back to their hometowns by -- by the -- by the city governments of these places, and many did go back, and my wife would never go back.</span> <span id="s1073">I am not too tempted to go back either, but I’m not as strict about this as my wife is.</span> <span id="s1074">I feel this -- it’s three generations later and I don’t think you can blame the present generation for the sins of their grandparents.</span> <span id="s1075">And working -- working in the Holocaust Museum, I see a lot of magazine -- magazines of present Germany and I -- and I see that they -- they have changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">Q: D-D-Do you -- would you go back to Fürth if they invited you back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">A: We have been invited back, a c -- a couple of times [indecipherable] I don’t think I want to, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">Q: Why not?</span> <span id="s1079">I-I know what -- n-not from your wife’s point of view, but your point of view.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">A: [indecipherable] There’s still -- still too many bad memories from that time, and especially if I see the older generations, my own generation, I would hate to see them when I go back to Germany.</span> <span id="s1081">I have nothing against the young ones, but the older ones I don’t want to meet again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">Q: Did you have any close non-Jewish friends when you were growing up, and how would you feel if you met them now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">A: I had a ver -- very good friend, a Christian friend who went to school with me, graduated with me and everything.</span> <span id="s1084">He became an -- a -- a doctor and he became a member of the armed -- German armed forces and he was in Russia all the time as a doctor, a German army doctor.</span> <span id="s1085">And I -- I met him when I -- when I went back to visit my brother-in-law and I kept up my -- th -- my friendship with him.</span> <span id="s1086">And he -- I really believe he was never a Nazi.</span> <span id="s1087">As a matter of fact, near the end of my -- when -- of the time when I was in Germany, he made -- he made it a point to walk with me and -- through the streets in Fürth, to be seen with me.</span> <span id="s1088">So I kept on corresponding with him until he died of -- a couple of years ago.</span> <span id="s1089">There were exceptions, of course, not all ba -- not all Germans were bad.</span> <span id="s1090">I’m the last one to believe that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q: When your children were the age that you were when Hitler came to power, 18 - 19 - 20 and then all the difficult years between 1933 and ’39, when your children were that same age that you were, did it remind you of those six difficult years you lived through in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">A: No, I never saw any connection between myself and my children in that respect.</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">A: They lived a completely different life and didn’t know anything about it except for the few things which we -- we told them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">Q: Are you angry that you had to go through the experiences that you did and other Jews did not, let’s say in this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">A: I’m sorry, I didn’t understand the question.</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">Q: Are you angry that you had to go through what you did in Germany, through Nazism, losing your family and so forth, and other Jews in the -- for instance, in this country, did not have to go through that.</span> <span id="s1098">Does that make you angry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">A: No, it doesn’t, it does not make me angry, but it -- it frustrates me sometimes that American Jews don’t seem to understand what we went through and went through the experiences, and many of them are not even interested in it.</span> <span id="s1100">I wouldn’t say the majority does that, but there are -- I’ve -- I’ve -- I’ve run into a number of them who don’t abs -- absolutely understand what Nazism meant at that time, what it did to the Jews.</span> <span id="s1101">Of course they -- they -- they couldn’t know.</span> <span id="s1102">You have to experience it yourself, otherwise you -- they just don’t know.</span> <span id="s1103">For instance, I remember I had a conversation with one man I knew pretty well in this building here.</span> <span id="s1104">He asked me one time, I co -- I don’t understand that you German Jews didn’t -- didn’t go to the nearest gun store, bought yourself a rifle or a gun and defended yourself.</span> <span id="s1105">Having known what went on, and what the circumstances were, this is sheer nonsense, was completely impossible.</span> <span id="s1106">If I had done that, if I had shot a -- a -- a German that time, they -- they wo -- they -- fi -- 10 minutes later they would have killed a thousand others -- sa -- a thousand Jews.</span> <span id="s1107">So I couldn’t understand that a well educated and informed man like him could even think of that.</span> <span id="s1108">That was not understandable to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">Q: So you feel the importance of Holocaust education, I assume.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">A: R-Right.</span> <span id="s1111">It’s very important.</span> <span id="s1112">And I know that the Holocaust Museum plays a large part in that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1114">How has your experience affected how y -- your feelings of being Jewish?</span> <span id="s1115">Did it change you spiritually, religiously in any way having undergone this because you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">A: What was your original question?</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">Q: Ho-How has all that you’ve lived through affected your feelings about being Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">A: No, it has not affected my feelings about being Jewish, in any way.</span> <span id="s1119">It hasn’t made me more religious or less religious.</span> <span id="s1120">It just didn’t affect me in that respect.</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">Q: Are you proud that you’re Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">A: Yes, I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">Q: Even though you were discriminated and you lost your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1125">I’ve always been proud of that.</span> <span id="s1126">There’s no problem in that respect.</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">Q: Were you active in -- in the United States, were you active in the Civil Rights movement?</span> <span id="s1128">After all, you lived through a time in Germany where civil rights were taken away from you.</span> <span id="s1129">Did you feel a connection to the Civil Rights movement here in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">A: Yes, I’m very much in favor of the Civil Rights movement, not that I personally was active in it, of course, but I have a lot of sympathy for it.</span> <span id="s1131">I feel it’s the right thing to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">Q: After all, you lived in a country where the civil rights were taken away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1134">There’s a s-special reason why I -- I’m in favor of the Civil Rights movement, because I see what happens if it’s not --</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">Q: And your feelings politically, do you think they have been influenced by your background?</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">A: Who me?</span> <span id="s1137">Politically?</span> <span id="s1138">No, I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">Q: What about your feelings about Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">A: I’m very much in favor of Israel, I’m a great admirer of Israel.</span> <span id="s1141">That’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">Q: Would you have wanted to settle there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">A: Under certain stircum -- circumstances, I would.</span> <span id="s1144">There was even a time when I considered it, when I was still in Germany, going to Israel -- to Palestine, at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">Q: When you were in Germany, were you a member of any youth groups, Jewish youth groups?</span> <span id="s1146">When you were in -- in -- young, in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">A: Yes, there were many Jewish youth groups.</span> <span id="s1148">Many Zionist one -- Zionist, and I -- there were times when I considered joining -- joining a group, but somehow I never got around to it.</span> <span id="s1149">I was a member of a Jewish sports club in Germany, which was Zionist.</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">Q: And is that the time you thought you would maybe go to Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">A: Yes, I -- there was a time when I considered it, but for practical purposes it didn’t -- it was not possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1153">Have you been to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">A: Yes, I have been, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1156">Do you think about th -- your experience in the 1930’s often now, as you’ve gotten older?</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">A: Yes, I do.</span> <span id="s1158">Especially si -- since I’m -- I’m working in the hol -- in the Holocaust Museum, that of course has a lot to do with it.</span> <span id="s1159">I’m constantly reminded o-of things at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">Q: What were you -- what were your thoughts during the Eichmann trial?</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">A: I -- I admired the fa -- the fact, of course, that -- that Israel was able to -- to do that, get him out of s -- of South America and bring him to Israel.</span> <span id="s1162">I was very proud of Israel at that time, that they could put him on trial.</span> <span id="s1163">That they -- to capture in -- him in -- I think in Argentina and bring him to Israel.</span> <span id="s1164">I was very proud of that fact.</span> <span id="s1165">That’s the right thing to do, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">Q: Was it painful for you to look at his face in the pictures?</span> <span id="s1167">Was it painful for you to look at his face in photographs?</span> <span id="s1168">A: No, I begu -- I didn’t know his face before, I had never seen him before in na -- not pictures or anything else.</span> <span id="s1169">I think Israel did the right thing, definitely, no question.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">Q: Are you more comfortable being around other German refugees?</span> <span id="s1171">Do you find yourself staying more with them, socializing, being with other refugees as opposed to American born Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">A: What -- what is your question?</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">Q: Are you more comfortable around Jewish --</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">A: Refugees.</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">Q: -- refugees, as opposed to non-Jewish or Jewish Americ -- you know, people who were born here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">A: I must have been in my earlier years, but now it -- it doesn’t matter to me any more who my friends are, whom I’m together with, as far as that is concerned.</span> <span id="s1177">But there was a time, a period when I was more comfortable with German refugees.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">Q: Why?</span> <span id="s1179">A: They were -- they were the people I knew, I -- I grew up with and who had the same experiences, whom I had a lot of common with -- in common with.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">Q: If you met somebody today and that person said where are you -- you know, where were you born, where did you come from, how much of your story would you tell to a s -- a new person?</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">A: The same things I -- just the story as it happened, completely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">Q: Do you feel this need to tell others?</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">A: Yes, more so in my later years now than I did earl -- before.</span> <span id="s1184">I feel there’s a need to -- to tell my story and our story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">Q: Wh-Why is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">A: Because I s -- I see that if it -- if this as a story is not told, it might happen again.</span> <span id="s1187">It might be a way of preventing a future Hitler from appearing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">Q: Do you think that’s possible?</span> <span id="s1189">That there could be a future Hitler?</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">A: Personally, I’m an optimist, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1191">But I would not say it’s impossible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">Q: Do you think there could be one in this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">A: I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">Q: Because?</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">A: Having seen Americans, having observed Americans in -- all the time, I don’t think they have it in them to the same extent as the Germans did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">Q: With what happened on September 11th this year, did that trigger anything for you?</span> <span id="s1197">The destruction, the loss of life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">A: No, I never b -- I never brought it in connection with what’s happened in Germany.</span> <span id="s1199">I don’t think that ever entered my mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">Q: I was thinking the destruction, the loss of life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">A: N-No, I never -- I never saw any connection with -- with Nazism.</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">Q: When you hear about a man like Osama Bin Laden, does that make you think of Hitler?</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">A: Frankly, I -- I never did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">Q: When you’re -- do you think in German?</span> <span id="s1205">When you’re thinking to yourself do you think in German or in English?</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">A: I’m -- I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s1207">I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1208">I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">Q: And you and your wife converse in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">A: Mostly in English.</span> <span id="s1211">I would say 80 percent -- 80 percent in English.</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">Q: Did you teach your children German?</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">A: No.</span> <span id="s1214">My daughter was more exposed to some German because she’s older and at that time maybe we spoke more German than w -- than we did later on.</span> <span id="s1215">So she picked up some German.</span> <span id="s1216">Sh-She understands quite a bit, but she doesn’t speak any.</span> <span id="s1217">My daughter also made the statement that she would never go to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">Q: And what reasons does she give?</span> <span id="s1219">A: I guess after all she heard from us, she acquired that attitude.</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">Q: And how d -- how -- how do you handle this with your grandchildren when they question you, how -- wh-what are the -- what is the age range of your -- your grandchildren?</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">A: My grandchildren ra-range from 11 to 31.</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1223">And so when they were younger, and they would ask you questions, what -- how would you respond about your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">A: They didn’t ask me too many questions, I must say.</span> <span id="s1225">I mean, of course I volunteered many things, they didn’t have to ask me.</span> <span id="s1226">But actually, they never asked me any -- hardly asked me any questions about -- that’s one of the reasons why I think it’s important that I write my memoirs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1228">And your children then explained to their children what you and your wife had -- have been through?</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">A: Frankly I d -- I don’t know that.</span> <span id="s1230">I don’t know how much they touched that subject.</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">A: Ta -- I should ask them, actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">Q: Let’s now talk about your experience at the museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">A: About my what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">Q: I-I wanted to talk about your experience at the museum itself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">Q: What was your first encounter with the museum?</span> <span id="s1238">How did you hear about it in the beginning?</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">A: I heard about it right away when I came to -- no, when I came here there was no Holocaust Museum yet.</span> <span id="s1240">I was looking for some volunteer work I could do, and I couldn’t think of nothing -- I could think of nothing better than the Holocaust Museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">Q: So you -- you -- you started working with them after the building was built?</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">A: Yes, right.</span> <span id="s1243">I must have started f-four years ago.</span> <span id="s1244">Four to five years ago.</span> <span id="s1245">And do you know what I’m doing?</span> <span id="s1246">I’m do -- making translations.</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">Q: I wanted you to explain what you’re doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1249">I’m translating German documents.</span> <span id="s1250">Not only documents, collections of letters, all kinds of p-political, military docum -- whatever.</span> <span id="s1251">Whatever they give me to translate.</span> <span id="s1252">I’m surprised that now, after 60 years almost after the end of the war, that they are still -- there’s still more available.</span> <span id="s1253">I expected three years ago that they wouldn’t have any more work for me, but it seems they do.</span> <span id="s1254">They get a lot of collections now.</span> <span id="s1255">Letter collections.</span> <span id="s1256">Letters which people wrote to their relatives.</span> <span id="s1257">People who were left behind in Germany and their children were in a -- in foreign countries already.</span> <span id="s1258">And many people it see -- it seems, send these letter collections to the Holocaust Museum now, and asked -- asked the Holocaust Museum to have them translated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">Q: So you’re not translating German military documents or anything like that?</span> <span id="s1260">You’re doing personal --</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">A: It’s not military --</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">Q: -- Jewish -- Jewish letters.</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">A: -- [indecipherable] few things which are similar to military document -- documents.</span> <span id="s1264">Orders which were given by the German military to the civilian population, let’s say in Poland, what to do with the Jews, things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">Q: And how do you keep yourself going when you read -- when you translate these things, it’s -- is it painful?</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">A: I-In many cases it’s pai -- it is painful.</span> <span id="s1267">There are many nights when I cannot fall asleep.</span> <span id="s1268">It’s not always easy to -- to work on this, especially when I’ve run into cases which are similar to my own family’s fate.</span> <span id="s1269">Concentration camps and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">Q: How -- how often do you work at the museum?</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">A: Once a week, four to five hours each time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">Q: Do you think that you bring any special insights as a -- as a staff member, as a volunteer staff member because of your background?</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">A: Yes, I think so.</span> <span id="s1274">I-I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">Q: Wha-What kind of insights do you bring?</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">A: Now, I have a -- I-I understand many -- many things better, how people -- how people felt about certain situations, especially in these collections of letters.</span> <span id="s1277">Ma -- for instance, parents whose children left Germany and they -- and the parents were still caught up in germ -- caught in Germany.</span> <span id="s1278">And I could understand very well how these -- how the parents felt, first about not being able to get out any more.</span> <span id="s1279">Number two about feeling left behind.</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">Q: So you are translating these German letters from both the children and the parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">A: Or in some cases from the German fra -- from the parents, and some cases from the chil -- but mostly -- mostly ger -- parents to the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">Q: Wh-Who are writing to their children in the United States in German?</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">A: In -- In the United States or other countries.</span> <span id="s1284">Mo-Mostly o -- United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1286">About what their experience i-is back in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1288">About their attempts to -- to get out of Germany, and so -- in many cases when they were -- they knew already they would not be able to get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">Q: How else has working at the museum affected your life?</span> <span id="s1290">You -- you said that there are times when you -- it’s difficult to fall asleep after you’ve read something very personal.</span> <span id="s1291">In any other ways has working at the museum affected --</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">A: In which ways?</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">Q: In any other ways, has working at the museum affected your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">A: I can’t think of anything right now, in that respect.</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">Q: Do you bring work home with you or only work at the museum?</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">A: I wanted to take things home, but I’m -- we are not allowed to do that.</span> <span id="s1297">We are not al-allowed to take any documents home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">Q: When you meet other people here who are from Europe --</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">A: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">Q: Do you encourage them to volunteer at the museum?</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">A: Yes, I d -- I do.</span> <span id="s1302">I tried a couple of times t-to persuade people to work in the Holocaust Museum.</span> <span id="s1303">But I don’t think so far I’ve been successful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">Q: What do you -- what reasons do you give them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">A: It’s ver-very interesting work, and -- and that they’d learn a lot about -- about th -- about the Judaism by doing this kind of work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Fred Goldman.</span> <span id="s1308">This is tape number three, side A. And we were talking about your work as a volunteer at the museum and -- and why you do it and the lessons that have been learned.</span> <span id="s1309">Is there anything else you want to add to that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">A: Lessons which I’ve learned by working in the Holocaust Museum?</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">A: I was very happy to see that so many people, looking at the nu -- large numbers of volunteers there, very happy to see that people are interested in it.</span> <span id="s1313">People who -- who do not come from Europe, who are -- maybe less motive -- must be less motivated than I am, but that still a lot of people have interest in this kind of work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">Q: What -- what is your relationship with the other volunteers who are survivors or witnesses to the Holocaust?</span> <span id="s1315">Do you have a special relationship with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">A: No, I don’t think I have a special relationship with them.</span> <span id="s1317">I meet a lot of them, I am a member of the survivor’s group, and that’s when I -- when I meet them sometimes wa -- once a month.</span> <span id="s1318">And I’m very happy to see there are so many in this group.</span> <span id="s1319">I never considered myself a survivor, not having been in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1320">Originally I thought survivors are only people who went through a concentration camp and are survivors of concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1321">But I am not, and the -- I see there are many others on the same position.</span> <span id="s1322">But it seems we are -- we are considered survivors in -- like in my case having lived in -- in Nazi Germany for six years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">Q: And having to escape to -- t -- having to escape to save your life, and then having lost all of your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">A: Right, yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">Q: Wha-What is your relationship to the volunteers at the museum who are not from Europe, who are not survivors and refugees?</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">A: The same thing.</span> <span id="s1327">The same relationship as with these sur-sur-survivors.</span> <span id="s1328">Very friendly with quite a number of them.</span> <span id="s1329">And I’d like to meet them, I’m looking forward to -- to every session there, every week when I go there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">Q: What do you feel like when you walk into the building?</span> <span id="s1331">Do you feel like this is a part of you?</span> <span id="s1332">What -- what -- what are your thoughts when you put your foot over the threshold?</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">A: Yeah, it’s a very important part of my life by now.</span> <span id="s1334">I -- I feel that I’m do -- doing important work and I -- for that reason I’m looking forward to going there every week.</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">Q: As opposed to walking into another government building, let’s say, why is that building different than another Federal building?</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">A: Because it has a lot more meaning to me than other government buildings.</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">Q: What -- what kind of meaning?</span> <span id="s1338">What kind of meaning does it have to you, does that building represent to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">A: I feel it -- it -- it’s very important to me.</span> <span id="s1340">More important to a -- to other government buildings, because of my fate and of what’s happened to me.</span> <span id="s1341">And because I’m becoming more and more convinced that it’s very important to ha -- to -- to have the Holocaust Museum.</span> <span id="s1342">I’m surprised to see there’s a -- so many non-Jews are going there.</span> <span id="s1343">To me it looks bi -- looking around, I have the feeling that 80 to 85 percent of the people who come there are non-Jews, and I’m very happy to see that they seem to be interested.</span> <span id="s1344">Of course, they don’t come all -- they don’t all come on their own account, they come besa -- because they’re being sent by I don’t know whom.</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">Q: Is it appropriate that there is this building in the United States, in Washington?</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">A: Definitely.</span> <span id="s1347">It’s very important.</span> <span id="s1348">They should have more Holocaust museums in the rest of the country.</span> <span id="s1349">There should be more -- more of them.</span> <span id="s1350">Like in new yor -- in New York City, they -- they have some kind of a Holocaust museum, but it -- it’s not what this one is.</span> <span id="s1351">Th -- like th-the new one they have in New York is only -- only part of it is Holocaust museum, the rest is jew -- Jewish museum.</span> <span id="s1352">I understand only one floor there is u -- being used for that purpose, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">Q: Have you been to Yad Vashem in is -- in Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">A: Yes, I’ve been there, a number of years ago.</span> <span id="s1355">And I was very impressed by there, too.</span> <span id="s1356">But of course, the Washington mem -- memorial hol -- Holocaust Museum is better for the purpose it is supposed to be.</span> <span id="s1357">It’s a -- it’s more technically advanced, whatever they show, than what I saw that time in Yad Vashem.</span> <span id="s1358">So people must be more impressed with what they see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">Q: Have you had any very powerful experiences or memorable experiences when you’re working there?</span> <span id="s1360">You did mention how when you read letters from people who were left behind that that was very touching.</span> <span id="s1361">Any other memorable experiences you can talk about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">A: No, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1363">I know many people -- many other people did, but I can not remember of any case that I was especially impressed by something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">Q: Are -- is there -- are there any particular parts of the museum, or the exhibits with which you identify, when you’ve gone through the exhibit?</span> <span id="s1365">Do you see anything that really touches you personally?</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">A: That one big room where all the -- where the -- where children express their thoughts about the -- about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1367">What -- what do you call that place?</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">Q: You’re talking about the tiles, the room with the tiles?</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">A: The tiles, right, yes.</span> <span id="s1370">They impress me very much and I go there very often to look at these tiles.</span> <span id="s1371">Some of them are excellent of these tiles.</span> <span id="s1372">They tell you a lot.</span> <span id="s1373">It also shows how children, espe -- especially children react to these events.</span> <span id="s1374">What means more to them than to other people and -- and so on.</span> <span id="s1375">I think that’s an excellent idea to have these on -- on -- so prominently displayed as they are.</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">Q: In the permanent exhibit, wa -- in the beginning when it shows life in Germany and then the increasing restrictions that were imposed on the Jews -- do you know what I mean, in the -- on the top floor, on the fourth floor, when you read this, does it bring it all back to you, what you lived through in the 30’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">Q: Yeah, it certainly brings everything back to me.</span> <span id="s1378">I had the same experiences.</span> <span id="s1379">But of course, in my case it’s a long time.</span> <span id="s1380">That was 60 years ago or more, so maybe these impressions were not too strong i-in me any more.</span> <span id="s1381">But now, of course, this -- this all reminds me very much of what’s happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">Q: So you feel as you’ve gotten older and for -- farther removed in time, it does make a difference?</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1384">It certainly brings it back much -- much better.</span> <span id="s1385">When I see these things I -- I notice that I had forgotten many things which happened that time to me and to th -- to the other Jewish people and which slowly diminished in my -- in my memory.</span> <span id="s1386">This brings it back again, very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">Q: Did you have to change your name to Israel or add your name Israel to your papers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">A: Yeah, I did have to sha -- like everybody else.</span> <span id="s1389">I still have it in my old passport when I -- when I left Germany.</span> <span id="s1390">Everybody had to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">Q: What did you feel like when you had to do that, when you were forced to do that?</span> <span id="s1392">A: There were so many other th-things, and worse things which happened to us in that time, that it didn’t make any particular impression on me.</span> <span id="s1393">I considered it more as a nuisance, I think, at the time when it happened.</span> <span id="s1394">Seeing -- with all the other things hap -- happening to us, that was only a small part.</span> <span id="s1395">Comparively -- a small nuisance compared to many other things which happened which were much worse at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">Q: How did your sister take to adding Sarah to her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">A: Frankly, I don’t remember that.</span> <span id="s1398">I don’t think we ever discussed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">Q: Do you receive reparations from Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">A: Yes, I do.</span> <span id="s1401">I got restitution for a number of things.</span> <span id="s1402">For the loss -- for the loss of our house, our business and i-interruption of our education.</span> <span id="s1403">But it was -- it -- it didn’t amount to much money.</span> <span id="s1404">And for many things I didn't get anything at all.</span> <span id="s1405">For instance, the value of our -- our stock in th -- in our business, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">Q: Did it take a long time to receive it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">A: Yes, it was very difficult, very hard.</span> <span id="s1408">It had something to do with the fact that our -- my lawyer was not very efficient, I think.</span> <span id="s1409">He was -- I guess he was too old at the time.</span> <span id="s1410">For every letter I -- I wrote, I had to wait -- wait a long [indecipherable] sometimes I had to write three or four times to get a answer -- an answer from him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">Q: Thi-This was the lawyer in Germany?</span> <span id="s1412">A: Yes, it was a Jewish lawyer.</span> <span id="s1413">It was in Fürth.</span> <span id="s1414">Maybe that’s the reason why I took him that time.</span> <span id="s1415">And I -- then later on I changed lawyers, then it was a little better.</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">Q: And are you still getting monthly payments?</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">A: I’m still getting German Social Security, monthly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">Q: How do you feel about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">A: Doesn’t bother me.</span> <span id="s1420">I -- I think it’s coming to me, after what happened to me.</span> <span id="s1421">After al -- all the other things I’ve lost.</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">Q: Is there anything else you’d like to add, maybe for your grandchildren when they listen to this tape?</span> <span id="s1423">Any -- any thoughts that you have about what you went through, or what you wanted them to learn from it?</span> <span id="s1424">Anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">A: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1426">Whatever I -- I think my grandchildren should learn about it or find out will be in-included in my life’s story, in my memoirs.</span> <span id="s1427">And I must have put that down already in my memoirs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">Q: Well, it’s important that you are doing your memoirs, that’s wonderful --</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">A: Yeah, I think so too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">Q: -- it’s a won -- it’s a wonderful gift to your children, so -- and thank you very much for doing this interview today.</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">A: I thank you too for doing it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">Q: This concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Fred
