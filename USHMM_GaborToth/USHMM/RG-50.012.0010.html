Yes, and he had three brothers.</span> <span id="s88">Six people were in this place where she lived with her husband and friends.</span> <span id="s89">It was in the time of the war-she met a Jewish man and lived with him-six people under the steps there was a little place to keep them.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">05:61 Before the ghetto she lived in a little place-she was a worker in an office with a German boss.</span> <span id="s91">When the ghetto closed-so they got workers of the office better places to live.</span> <span id="s92">So she bought a place on the third flight thatched roof-she took her husband there-this apartment was little one.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">06:05 So when the ghetto closed-put husband in hiding place in her new apartment and she went to take the three others of his family out of the ghetto-how she took out she came in inside-took the three men-they put her under their arms and she played as a very drunk woman.</span> <span id="s94">But on the street there were Gestapo walking all the time to look for people.</span> <span id="s95">So they saw them going with a drunk woman they said,"Such a Polish swine" and so she took them home.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q.</span> <span id="s97">In other words, the Germans said, "That's just like the Poles."</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A. And so it was a reason for her to take them home.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">06:46</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q. Was she very frightened?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A.</span> <span id="s102">Her husband's brother was taken to Treblinka on a train.</span> <span id="s103">He jumped off the train and came to the place near the house because his brother had told him if something happened they'd go to her apartment.</span> <span id="s104">At night he saw her coming out of the door-he came with strong will to door and said,"I want to go in, they are my brothers."</span> <span id="s105">So she said,"There is no brothers, what are you looking for?</span> <span id="s106">But he was strong and pushed in the door and then she understood it was true- they began to kiss one another she let him in.</span> <span id="s107">There was one brother that worked in a train station and as we know, the train station is more dangerous and most difficult place because there were many Gestapo and many people and so many Germans that no one had the courage to come a little nearer.</span> <span id="s108">She decided she had to go to get the one brother and take him out and bring him to her apartment.</span> <span id="s109">She decided when went it was very dangerous.</span> <span id="s110">She saw a German with a very big gun.</span> <span id="s111">He asked, "Do you know it is not allowed to go visit someone?"</span> <span id="s112">So she knew a little German to explain to him "Look, there is living my aunt and she is a dress maker and I want to know perhaps my dress is already finished.</span> <span id="s113">And I have to go to ask because I haven't any other choice to know.</span> <span id="s114">So please I believe you are a good man and perhaps as a good man you will allow me to go to look for this aunt to know about my dress.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">So he said,"O.K., I will allow you.</span> <span id="s116">Please look out for yourself because another one cannot be a good man.</span> <span id="s117">There are many such German people- but from my side go over it, but others please look of yourself."</span> <span id="s118">Then he went away and she went away.</span> <span id="s119">She took the work factory materials-she saw many children working hard - she decided she had no choice - she took a pail and went to the field and cried, "Galitski, the Germans are looking for you, you are electrical-they need you,"she didn't know anything but she had no choice so she cried,"Galitski, come here!"</span> <span id="s120">When he heard this he</span></p> <p><span id="s121">came.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">It was a little after daylight so she took his hand and began to run in other position of all the lager.</span> <span id="s123">They ran away through the field to her apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q. Could she manage to feed all these people?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">08:75 A.</span> <span id="s126">Her boss was very old.</span> <span id="s127">He decided she has to get the same (wages) as the Germans that worked there because the Germans work only in the office.</span> <span id="s128">So he said she really worked hard cleaning everything so nice- so therefore she got the same as the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q.</span> <span id="s130">She didn't have children at the time did she?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A. No.</span> <span id="s132">She brought all these things-sugar, vodka, so she would sell these things to get other things.</span> <span id="s133">For vodka she could get anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q.</span> <span id="s135">How long were they in this place?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A. 1942 until the end of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q.</span> <span id="s138">What was it like having all these people in such a little place?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A. With her husband together they built there on the roof one more wall.</span> <span id="s140">It was big enough for a person to stand in.</span> <span id="s141">There was a little door the same as the wall so that no one could see it was a door in a wall.</span> <span id="s142">They were not behind this door unless they felt is coming the danger.</span> <span id="s143">Her husband's brother was an electrician-they were on the third floor-in the door in the kitchen-in the hideaway in their apartment down under the table he put a little light- so when she heard someone coming upstairs to her she put the light on- if and when they saw this light then they knew that there was danger.</span> <span id="s144">They went under the wall and closed themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q.</span> <span id="s146">So it sounds like it was a good system, and they all survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">They lived through the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A. All of them lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">09:81</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q.</span> <span id="s151">What was it like?</span> <span id="s152">Was there any privacy?</span> <span id="s153">Was it very crowded?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Did they fight?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A. No, never quarreled.</span> <span id="s156">They lived very nice.</span> <span id="s157">They lived very</span></p> <p><span id="s158">friendly.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q.</span> <span id="s160">When she looks back at the time does it feel like a good time in</span></p> <p><span id="s161">some way?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A. Not once is there speaking about this time.</span> <span id="s163">But as a matter of fact, it seems as if it went away.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q. Does she herself think about this time very much?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">10:15</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A. No.</span> <span id="s167">She knew herself then it was terrible and dangerous.</span> <span id="s168">If she decided to help she had to do it without fear because they knew that also they were going to be killed at the end of it.</span> <span id="s169">So if she decided to help she had to do.</span> <span id="s170">She was living in this apartment as one person and she bought this apartment as one person.</span> <span id="s171">So they had to be careful when buying carts of food.</span> <span id="s172">They had to be careful of the neighbors.</span> <span id="s173">She needed not for one but for seven.</span> <span id="s174">So when she'd hear neighbors going to sleep she'd take a sack to buy a little more flour or something at the black market.</span> <span id="s175">The neighbors were so not good people that if they saw perhaps she's bringing something more they'd ask,"Who is that for?"</span> <span id="s176">So she always came upstairs in such a hurry with incredible fear.</span> <span id="s177">She had to have her head on to stay alive.</span> <span id="s178">From the market to her apartment it usually took five minutes.</span> <span id="s179">But one day it took her an hour because her legs were trembling so much.</span> <span id="s180">When she got home she found all six crying on the floor because they were sure it was that night they were to die.</span> <span id="s181">She told them, "Please come up and be alive not dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">There was one toilet for the whole building.</span> <span id="s183">They had to go to the bathroom in a pail.</span> <span id="s184">She had to bring the pail down everyday.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Water was also not upstairs.</span> <span id="s186">They were allowed to bring two pails of water upstairs everyday.</span> <span id="s187">Everyday after work she took two pails and in the evening before the night she took two more for seven people.</span> <span id="s188">She told the people she was a poor girl alone and wants to stay alive-she came from other places-she does the wash for other people.</span> <span id="s189">She bought two big, nice, fat rabbits.</span> <span id="s190">She had to buy more than one loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s191">If she knew the person in the bakery they would ask why she needed so many.</span> <span id="s192">Sometimes she would have to look everywhere for a bakery where she didn't know anyone.</span> <span id="s193">Her husband made her a basket, a big one so she put the bread on the inside and grass for the rabbits or wood for the ovens on the outside.</span> <span id="s194">As you know in Europe there are cold winters.</span> <span id="s195">During the winters there was nothing to eat, only vegetables-potatoes.</span> <span id="s196">Had to prepare more than was necessary-more than usual before the winter came.</span> <span id="s197">She got a big bag of potatoes-how to bring them because everyone thought she was alone.</span> <span id="s198">A man helped her bring the potatoes home.</span> <span id="s199">The neighbor saw and asked why she needed so many potatoes.</span> <span id="s200">She answered that her friend in the office asked to store her potatoes at her apartment because she did not have enough room in her own apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q.</span> <span id="s202">What happened to her husband after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A.</span> <span id="s204">He wants to say later.</span> <span id="s205">The neighbor from downstairs came to her with a proposition.</span> <span id="s206">She said there was a little place in the roof in which Jews used to live.</span> <span id="s207">She was convinced where the Jews had hid were hidden treasures like jewels.</span> <span id="s208">She wanted to look for the treasures.</span> <span id="s209">She was so scared, she said,"I'm too tired after work to do that."</span> <span id="s210">She said," You can't say Germans won't stay here, can't say the Germans won't win the war.</span> <span id="s211">When the Germans will stay in town then we'll make it 50/50.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Once in one night, it can be perhaps at two or three o'clock, suddenly there was a knock outside.</span> <span id="s213">All the people took things and went to hide behind the wall.</span> <span id="s214">The person asked, "Who's living here?"</span> <span id="s215">She opened the door and said "I'm living here, I am a girl from Yedinya living alone."</span> <span id="s216">He asked,"Where are working in the German office?"</span> <span id="s217">She showed him where she was working.</span> <span id="s218">She told all the stories that she was a poor girl and everything.</span> <span id="s219">He believed she was just a poor girl and went</span></p> <p><span id="s220">away.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q.
