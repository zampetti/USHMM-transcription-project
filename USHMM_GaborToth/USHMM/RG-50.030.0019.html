I was told that I was in a hurry to be born.</span> <span id="s22">The fourth child, fortunately for my mother, was a boy.</span> <span id="s23">She had hoped for a boy when I was coming, but it didn't work out.</span> <span id="s24">I have a lot of qualities that could have been a boy, but I was a girl.</span> <span id="s25">The last child was named Robert Paul.</span> <span id="s26">I have only one name.</span> <span id="s27">Renee has only one name and Dolly has only one name, but my mother had two names for her favorite boy that was finally born.</span> <span id="s28">After that, no more children.</span> <span id="s29">I would like to talk about my parents first, because the family was quite an unusual family in a sense.</span> <span id="s30">My father was the oldest of a family of ten and my mother was the youngest of a family of about nine or ten.</span> <span id="s31">I don't even know.</span> <span id="s32">We had too many uncles and aunts to know much about them.</span> <span id="s33">But I know my parents pretty well.</span> <span id="s34">My father was destined to be a doctor by one of his uncles.</span> <span id="s35">I think the only rich uncle he had, and the uncle was going to pay for medical studies, so he was asked what he wanted to be, but he had to start medical studies, and he did.</span> <span id="s36">But when he was in the middle of it, he became, what we called in Holland, a major when you're 21.</span> <span id="s37">Then you could find for yourself what you wanted to be.</span> <span id="s38">He decided he was not going to be a doctor.</span> <span id="s39">He decided he was going to be a musician, which fit his nature, I think, very well, because he was very vain.</span> <span id="s40">He liked to show off.</span> <span id="s41">He liked to be admired, and he was admired in his life.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: He was a musician; what instrument did he play?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: He studied the piano, and he was poor as poor can be because the uncle immediately withdrew his support because he had not followed his medical studies.</span> <span id="s44">When my mother grew up, she being the youngest, she was the last to get married and she was also a very beautiful woman.</span> <span id="s45">I think the reason they both married didn't promise happiness.</span> <span id="s46">I think it was to be expected, but I discovered later that they were not really happy with each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: Why was it expected that they were going to marry?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: Well, because I think the motives were wrong.</span> <span id="s49">I don't think that they had the right idea about why they married.</span> <span id="s50">As I said, my mother was a beautiful woman, and she had several boyfriends.</span> <span id="s51">She was not in love with my father.</span> <span id="s52">She didn't really meet him long enough, but there is another member of the family that I have to mention, and that was my favorite aunt.</span> <span id="s53">My mother's only unmarried sister.</span> <span id="s54">Her name was Aunt Wannett.</span> <span id="s55">We called her "Tante", which is Aunt, Nett, Tante Nett.</span> <span id="s56">She was a wonderful character, and she was a member of our family because she didn't have one of her own.</span> <span id="s57">She lived with my grandmother because she did not have a family, but she had adopted our family as her family.</span> <span id="s58">The reason why is that in those days a girl didn't find a husband fast enough, they would have to find an occupation, because they had to make money.</span> <span id="s59">They had to earn a living.</span> <span id="s60">So, what she did is she took piano lessons from my father when he was a piano teacher, and became very much in love with him, but he didn't with her, because she was not as beautiful as my mother.</span> <span id="s61">Probably the reason she wasn't married was because she was the least beautiful of the family.</span> <span id="s62">So, there was this unmarried aunt which I thought was a wonderful person.</span> <span id="s63">I was closer to her than I think I ever was to my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: When was she born?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: She was one of the older sisters.</span> <span id="s66">I don't know in a family of ten exactly where she fit, because I was rather neglectful of the rest of my aunts and uncles, having about 20 of them, it is hard to keep up.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: Are both of your families, your father's family and your mother's family come from Amsterdam?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: Yes, they did.</span> <span id="s69">My father's family was full Jewish, and my mother's family was full Gentile.</span> <span id="s70">Actually, neither one was educated with religion forcefully.</span> <span id="s71">So, the families had no contact.</span> <span id="s72">The grandfathers and the grandmothers didn't have any.</span> <span id="s73">I never knew my grandfather from mother's side, but I knew my grandfather and grandmother from father's side.</span> <span id="s74">In the early days, my father and I would go there for dinner on Friday nights.</span> <span id="s75">The Jews were more or less of dinner on Friday nights.</span> <span id="s76">So, but that's early memories, and I don't remember much of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: How were you raised, more Jewish or more Christian or not religious at all?</span> <span id="s78">A: The marriage?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: No.</span> <span id="s80">How were you raised, more Jewish or Christian?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: That comes next.</span> <span id="s82">We were raised without any particular religion.</span> <span id="s83">My mother had gone to church when she was a girl, but there was no church in our life designated to be ours.</span> <span id="s84">When I asked my father about religion, he said something about it, which I thought was very wise.</span> <span id="s85">He said, "There are lots of religions in the world, and you can read up on it.</span> <span id="s86">There is the Koran, there is the Jewish religion, and there is the Catholic religion and the Far East religion.</span> <span id="s87">When you grow up you will read what there is in the world, and if there is something that appeals to you that you feel that you can believe in."</span> <span id="s88">In other words, he didn't impose anything, which I have appreciated all my life.</span> <span id="s89">He left that to our judgment, and I happen to haven't felt the need for a church.</span> <span id="s90">I thought the sky and whatever I don't see and whatever I don't know, I try to formulate it.</span> <span id="s91">So, I have no religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: But, did you know when you were a child about Jewish culture or about Christian culture, or was there nothing --?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: Oh, yes, I read up gradually, because when I went to school and met other children and found out that really in Holland one was Catholic or Protestant or Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: Which school did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: I went to the School.</span> <span id="s96">I went to -- the school situation was funny.</span> <span id="s97">All of the Belinfantes had children and my parents of course, too, were very brilliant students.</span> <span id="s98">You had to be the first in the class when you are a Belinfante because that was easy.</span> <span id="s99">Learning was easy for all four of us.</span> <span id="s100">I didn't do very much my best and neither did my older sister, but we got by with what time we spent to learn.</span> <span id="s101">I was very naughty.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: In what sense, naughty?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: Oh, I was very hard to be disciplined because I knew -- the pace of learning was so slow, because you had to have the average possibility of the children and I did terrible learning.</span> <span id="s104">My sister has a memory, it's fantastic.</span> <span id="s105">I called her a bookshelf, because whatever she read, she knew.</span> <span id="s106">So, she never had to learn.</span> <span id="s107">I did have to learn, but I didn't always do it.</span> <span id="s108">I was usually distracted with other things.</span> <span id="s109">I was always interested in my school mates, and I got bored with the Temple that we learned in school.</span> <span id="s110">My oldest sister was the least gifted, Dolly, and she died very young, unfortunately, peritonitis that wasn't treated -- I mean appendix first was not removed, and they put ice on it and in two days she was gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: When did she die?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: She was fourteen, and I was eleven at that time.</span> <span id="s113">Q: Do you remember the year?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: When she was fourteen, I was eleven, in 1915, I was eleven.</span> <span id="s115">I was born in 1904, so I should have been eleven.</span> <span id="s116">I don't figure as fast as I used to.</span> <span id="s117">Then, a strange period happened in our life.</span> <span id="s118">Because when my sister died, my mother was terribly sad, and I remember that they came back from the hospital and said, "Dolly is gone."</span> <span id="s119">I remember that vividly.</span> <span id="s120">It's hard for children to understand that a child is gone, but we didn't have much communication after that.</span> <span id="s121">There comes the first sign that I thought my mother's directions were not the usual reactions, because she was very very sad the moment that it happened.</span> <span id="s122">I remember that and the days that followed right after that, that we never saw my mother much.</span> <span id="s123">I think she died in the spring or early summer -- I could look that up, that date -- but after that there was a vacation in school, like every summer, and we three kids were sent to a and mother did not live with us during several weeks.</span> <span id="s124">I never understood that.</span> <span id="s125">The only time that I understood it a little bit I think, is that it all hit at the time that the marriage was already on the rocks, because they divorced when I was 11 also, but not right after.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: That was in 1915?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: In 1915, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: Your parents divorced?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: Divorced, and I remember that there was not any hardship or any fighting and they have always been on speaking terms ever since, as long as my father lived, which was not very much time.</span> <span id="s130">It was in 1923 he died.</span> <span id="s131">But they had been on friendly terms.</span> <span id="s132">But we children saw that things were not right.</span> <span id="s133">Of course, the way I look at it now, is very different from the way that I looked at it when I was 11 years old, because that is when it happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: How is the difference?</span> <span id="s135">How did you look then and how do you look now?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: Because when you're under 11 years old, you don't really analyze your parents and how happy they are and what might have happened before they parted company.</span> <span id="s137">I didn't analyze them.</span> <span id="s138">I know what my father was like, and I know what my mother was like to us, to me, mostly.</span> <span id="s139">What you don't do is analyze what they did.</span> <span id="s140">Why they acted like this.</span> <span id="s141">Why I know there were problems.</span> <span id="s142">Any child feels when there are problems.</span> <span id="s143">And the problems are hard to describe because I would have to start back and tell you that at a certain point we found out that my father had a son before he married my mother and that was our half-brother.</span> <span id="s144">He was a merchant marine so he was gone first to a school, like the marines get their education, and then he was out at sea.</span> <span id="s145">He went to the Dutch Indies, and then he came home occasionally.</span> <span id="s146">So, that was the other addition to the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: When did you hear about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: Probably when I was under ten.</span> <span id="s149">When I saw him, and he came, he was our brother Hugo, but for us he was like a man.</span> <span id="s150">He had come , and then to the Dutch Indies and other trips, and so he became more and more a member of the family.</span> <span id="s151">It was not too long after that, we got into the first World War, and that's when he was called in the service.</span> <span id="s152">He was more home.</span> <span id="s153">And I would like to stop.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: You just told us about your half brother you met around when you were ten years old, so that was shortly before the outbreak of World War I.</span> <span id="s155">How did you meet him?</span> <span id="s156">Do you remember that?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: How did I meet who?</span> <span id="s158">Q: Your half brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s160">When he came back from any trip, we met him.</span> <span id="s161">It was very often in the summer.</span> <span id="s162">My sister Dolly, the oldest one, had always bronchitis.</span> <span id="s163">She was always sick in the climate of Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s164">So, we spent summer vacation, which was officially six weeks, about three months out of school and went to the east part of Holland, the high part of Holland, .</span> <span id="s165">We just made up what we didn't get from school, because as I said before, we learned easy, and school was not that demanding.</span> <span id="s166">In fact, I remember very little from what I learned at school.</span> <span id="s167">And what I did learn is of no use to me, except the languages.</span> <span id="s168">We started in fourth grade with French and kept going and in fifth grade we added German and in sixth grade we added English, and they all went on.</span> <span id="s169">I only have schooling to seventh grade.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: What was the name of the school?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: School, and it was in , the same street that my father had a music school later on, so that street is very familiar to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: Was it a public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: Public school.</span> <span id="s174">The reason I was mentioning all of that is that I was so naughty, I told you before, my father was threatened that I would be sent away from the public school which meant that I would have to go to a private school, which he could ill afford.</span> <span id="s175">So, for the first time that I remember, he talked like we say here, like a Dutch uncle to me and said you better shape up because I can't afford to put you in a private school.</span> <span id="s176">I have always been very conscious of the fact that I was his favorite child.</span> <span id="s177">And the reason was because I was quite a bit like him, and I also was the only one that had enough musical talent that he thought I would become a musician.</span> <span id="s178">In fact, in the early days, all of us had music lessons every week.</span> <span id="s179">All of us had to study music in the same room.</span> <span id="s180">So we had to divide.</span> <span id="s181">There was a schedule for the week.</span> <span id="s182">Every child had to mark down which time he wanted to practice in that room, because you had to fit in.</span> <span id="s183">Dolly played violin until she died.</span> <span id="s184">She was the least talented, and Renee played piano.</span> <span id="s185">So my father thought I should play the cello.</span> <span id="s186">So at an early age, about 10, nine or 10, I started with the cello.</span> <span id="s187">So, for my brother Bob, there was no other instrument that my father could think of, so he played the piano again.</span> <span id="s188">But he thought for me that the cello was nice because we had a trio, a violin, piano, and cello.</span> <span id="s189">We have pictures of where we sit around the piano and all of us played together.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: And your father gave musical lessons?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: No, he was too busy.</span> <span id="s192">He had a music school, and so we got lessons from other people.</span> <span id="s193">I get later to my lessons, because that is quite a story.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: Let's go back to school.</span> <span id="s195">Why were you threatened to be sent away from school?</span> <span id="s196">You said earlier you had sort of boyish qualities.</span> <span id="s197">Had that anything to do with that?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: No, I was just bored, and when I got bored I would think of things that I could do that would keep me amused.</span> <span id="s199">I had a cousin who was very naughty, and she was sent away from school.</span> <span id="s200">She was about my age, and she was the daughter of one of my sisters.</span> <span id="s201">My mother's family was closer known to us than my father's family.</span> <span id="s202">We didn't seem to agree.</span> <span id="s203">My grandfather was an unpleasant man and my grandmother, I don't think she smelled right.</span> <span id="s204">You know, kind of a feeling of not belonging in that family.</span> <span id="s205">That was very strange.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: How did your parents meet?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: My parents met -- that is a very nice story.</span> <span id="s208">My favorite aunt, as I said before, was the only unmarried aunt that I had.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: What was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: Aunt Wannett, but we called her Tante Nett, and Tante Nett had to take a profession, I told you.</span> <span id="s211">So, she found my father, when he was not married yet, as her teacher, and fell immediately in love with him, like a lot of women did.</span> <span id="s212">My father had tremendous success with women, and he behaved like a Spanish .</span> <span id="s213">He wore a black flabar (ph) and caveat like you make a bow tie.</span> <span id="s214">Not like the stiff tie that people wear.</span> <span id="s215">He was anything but stiff.</span> <span id="s216">He would take his hat off with a beautiful gesture whenever he saw any one of his female friends or students.</span> <span id="s217">He had an imposing appearance.</span> <span id="s218">As I said, they all were in love.</span> <span id="s219">I have a picture of his class of students, there's not a man in there.</span> <span id="s220">They're all women.</span> <span id="s221">So, I'm sure he was very attracted to women.</span> <span id="s222">So, when Nett came home, she was raving to her little sister, Georgenne, which was my mother, George, for short, nobody says Georgenne all the time.</span> <span id="s223">Then she was raving about Aury, Aury Belinfante, you should see Aury.</span> <span id="s224">He is just wonderful, and he plays the piano wonderfully.</span> <span id="s225">Why don't you take lessons from Aury, too.</span> <span id="s226">Nett was somebody who'd always think of how she could help other people.</span> <span id="s227">And she was passed the hope that Aury would ever look at her, because she was one of the least good looking girls of the family.</span> <span id="s228">That was probably why she wasn't married.</span> <span id="s229">I think she was a darling person and a wonderful companion.</span> <span id="s230">But she took piano lessons until she finally had -- not finally, she did it very fast, in two years or something she got her diploma and became a piano teacher at my father's music school.</span> <span id="s231">But she was telling her sister, her favorite sister, because it was her youngest sister, because she took my mother out in the ring, so to speak, and told her that she should take piano lessons whether she liked it or not, so she could meet Aury, this wonderful man that everybody fell in love with.</span> <span id="s232">So, there is the picture you have.</span> <span id="s233">Georgenne was sought after because she was a little haughty, and a little hard to get, and she was a beautiful girl.</span> <span id="s234">Somebody must have said to Aury, why don't you get Georgenne, because she's hard to get.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: We stopped at the moment when you were just telling us that your aunt told her younger sister why don't you take piano lessons and meet Aury Belinfante, and so they got together.</span> <span id="s237">Was that very fast or how did that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: It happened pretty fast because she only took a few lessons.</span> <span id="s239">Mother didn't play anything much, and she wasn't really talented.</span> <span id="s240">She didn't go to take lessons from Aury, because she loved to take piano.</span> <span id="s241">I absolutely remember how she played.</span> <span id="s242">She played with her little finger going this way and back and forth, and it was funny to hear my mother play the piano.</span> <span id="s243">She had a rather nice singing voice, but she wasn't really musical.</span> <span id="s244">But she immediately caught fire when she met Aury, because he was such an important man, and he played so beautifully and could give concerts.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: Where did he give concerts?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: My father was one of the most prominent pianists at that time.</span> <span id="s247">Later on, he was the first one who played all of Beethoven 32 sonatas, which is three volumes high in from memory in a cycle of six concerts.</span> <span id="s248">That was at the end of his career.</span> <span id="s249">That's how important a musician he was.</span> <span id="s250">He was a very important man in the circle of teachers.</span> <span id="s251">He started the federation of music teachers in Holland and was the director until he died, which was 25 years later.</span> <span id="s252">He gave concerts every season until he died.</span> <span id="s253">In fact, he gave concerts in between his illness of which he died, which was colon cancer.</span> <span id="s254">He was, right away when you met him, you knew he was an important man, and he felt himself to be a bossy, important man.</span> <span id="s255">I mean, the things would happen the way Aury wanted it to happen.</span> <span id="s256">I can give you an example.</span> <span id="s257">My mother was completely, I would say submitted herself completely to what his will was, and most people did.</span> <span id="s258">On their honeymoon, he decided where they were going to go.</span> <span id="s259">They were going to walk with backpacks in the Black Forest, and he didn't ask what she wanted, absolutely not.</span> <span id="s260">That was it.</span> <span id="s261">So, they did it.</span> <span id="s262">Unfortunately, my mother followed, because he was a domineering, almost tyrant.</span> <span id="s263">In those days, the families lived a little bit more like that.</span> <span id="s264">That has changed in the time of my life to a very different situation.</span> <span id="s265">The father was the boss, no matter what.</span> <span id="s266">He was the bread winner.</span> <span id="s267">He worked hard, and everything had to do with what Father wanted.</span> <span id="s268">He bought the best clothes and he got catered to first, so he was used to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: When did they marry, what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: They must have gotten married, just two years before they had my sister, Dolly.</span> <span id="s271">Q: Around 1900?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: I would say so.</span> <span id="s273">They went to in Germany, and walked all day up the mountain and got to a little inn and wanted a room and dinner, and so they sat down to dinner and my father looked around and thought, well, the facilities are pretty primitive, so he asked if he could have a bath.</span> <span id="s274">And yes, he could have a bath, but it was good he asked before dinner, because they had a wood stove and it took a half an hour at least to get the water out.</span> <span id="s275">So, they could light it right now.</span> <span id="s276">So, I'm glad he asked.</span> <span id="s277">This was the story my mother told us.</span> <span id="s278">So, then, my mother said timidly, "Aury, do you think it takes another half an hour for the next bath?"</span> <span id="s279">He said, "What, you want a bath too?"</span> <span id="s280">That was never forgotten in the family.</span> <span id="s281">I mean my mother never forgot that.</span> <span id="s282">That instead of saying, I want a foot bath first, she was meek from the very beginning, and he was the boss and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: You told us about the two families of your father and your mother didn't quite come together, why not?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: Never, because they had nothing in common, I think is probably because the Jewish part was pretty religious in a sense.</span> <span id="s285">I don't know how much they went to church.</span> <span id="s286">I couldn't tell you.</span> <span id="s287">But the family of my father -- first of all, their father was not very family conscious.</span> <span id="s288">He had one son who kind of made it in the world, his name was , we called him Uncle Ralph.</span> <span id="s289">He was the director of Amsterdam Hotel, and he did well in his life.</span> <span id="s290">And there were lots of aunts.</span> <span id="s291">The uncles were not important and some of them were not very culturally interesting.</span> <span id="s292">He and Ralph were the ones of the men, and they had a few aunts there.</span> <span id="s293">They all married Jewish people.</span> <span id="s294">My father was the only one who married a Gentile and was completely not religious.</span> <span id="s295">And I don't know much about the others because my father was himself not very interested in all his brothers and sisters.</span> <span id="s296">I don't barely know their names.</span> <span id="s297">I mean I really have to fish into my memory to know the names of my family on my father's side.</span> <span id="s298">And the children I don't remember at all.</span> <span id="s299">So, we didn't get together as nephews and nieces.</span> <span id="s300">But on my mother's side, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: How was it at public school?</span> <span id="s302">You went to public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: Everybody went to public school.</span> <span id="s304">There was no religion in public school.</span> <span id="s305">There was no discrimination in public school.</span> <span id="s306">Everybody in the neighborhood went to that school.</span> <span id="s307">We walked to school, and we walked home for lunch.</span> <span id="s308">The times were from 9:00 to 12:00 and from 2:00 to 4:00, and my school was right near the Museum of Modern Art, which is still there in Amsterdam, and was the director, not at that time.</span> <span id="s309">That has a nice big, I would say corner where you could play ball.</span> <span id="s310">We played ball.</span> <span id="s311">It was a girls' school.</span> <span id="s312">It was not a mixed school.</span> <span id="s313">We never had boys at school.</span> <span id="s314">But we girls would play ball games after school when it was still light, about 6:00, and I tore my muscle one time from throwing the ball too forcefully with my right arm, and had my arm in a sling and had to write left handed because that takes a long time to heal.</span> <span id="s315">I did everything always to the nth degree of my possibilities.</span> <span id="s316">I never was careful.</span> <span id="s317">I always say I can do it and try it.</span> <span id="s318">Jumped on vehicles, like the state cars when they are full speed going by.</span> <span id="s319">I ran with it and jumped on the running board.</span> <span id="s320">I was that kind of a person.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: Maybe we can move on a little bit in time, but first, your parents divorced in 1915, and I would like to move from there very quickly to the late 20s, but first you probably have to explain with whom did you go on living with, your father or with your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: My father moved out.</span> <span id="s323">My father moved out and took some rooms nearby in .</span></p> <p><span id="s324">My mother lived practically all her life in the , one block down from .</span> <span id="s325">That's where we spent our time.</span> <span id="s326">And we girls, my sister died, she was not with us anymore, and my sister and I took turns spending the weekend at my father's place, which was just a few rooms on the , which he had rented.</span> <span id="s327">He gave his lessons, and we spent the weekend, helped him out and had lunch with him and straightened up his rooms and what have you.</span> <span id="s328">And so, then in those days, my half brother was more prominent in the picture, because he did not go back to being a merchant marine because of the World War interruption.</span> <span id="s329">When he came out of the service, when the war was over, in 1918, my uncle, an uncle from my mother's side, Uncle Dick, who was a broker in coffee offered him a job and educated him quickly to get his brokerage.</span> <span id="s330">He made a living that way.</span> <span id="s331">He stayed in Amsterdam, and that's when the time came that he was morally supporting my mother and from morally supporting, he became also mentally supporting.</span> <span id="s332">They became a couple without ever getting married.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: Uncle Dick and your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s335">My brother, my half-brother.</span> <span id="s336">Q: Your half-brother and your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s338">But my mother liked to surround herself with younger men and compensate for her unhappy marriage, because it was obvious it was an unhappy marriage.</span> <span id="s339">That also became tense, because when my brother came back and became a coffee broker, that was the time it became different situation.</span> <span id="s340">Because my half-brother, Hugo, fell in love with my mother, like most of these people around my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: How old was he?</span> <span id="s342">When was he born?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: I don't remember.</span> <span id="s344">He was about 18 when I remember him coming back from his trips.</span> <span id="s345">So, he must have been in his twenties somewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: So, he was born 1890.</span> <span id="s347">At the outbreak of World War 1, he was twenty?</span> <span id="s348">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: Your father died in?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: 1923, and he became ill in 1920.</span> <span id="s351">He became ill at the time on one of the Sundays that I was spending with him, and he told me that he had bowel obstruction.</span> <span id="s352">I said, "Since when?"</span> <span id="s353">and he said "A week."</span> <span id="s354">I said, "Are you crazy.</span> <span id="s355">You have to see a doctor immediately."</span> <span id="s356">This was a Sunday, because I was there for the weekend.</span> <span id="s357">And he said, what do you mean, I've never had a doctor.</span> <span id="s358">I don't have a doctor.</span> <span id="s359">He had had never a doctor, nor a dentist.</span> <span id="s360">He was a most healthy man.</span> <span id="s361">Strong, not too tall, but muscular and strong and physically strong and enormous stamina.</span> <span id="s362">He could work hours and hours and years and years and everything he decided.</span> <span id="s363">He was disciplined and strong willed, so he never had a doctor.</span> <span id="s364">And I said, we have to find a doctor, today.</span> <span id="s365">I mean you have had complete bowel obstruction for more than a week, and he said yes, and nothing helps it.</span> <span id="s366">I remember he would always walk through the room and kind of poke his abdomen, he had trouble.</span> <span id="s367">So, I called a professor at the Clinic.</span> <span id="s368">There was a famous professor whose daughter studied with him, and I said who I was and I said my father is ill.</span> <span id="s369">He said he had to immediately come in.</span> <span id="s370">So, he went in because I called him.</span> <span id="s371">I was 17, 16 or 17 and they operated immediately and found that it was cancer obstruction, which he had let go too long.</span> <span id="s372">That family of the professor whose daughter was studying at the conservatory he had was at that time something like 16 years old or 17, and she was not even 20, I remember that, and that develops into an entirely different story that happens, which I can't tell, which he had that operation and he got up and over it, temporarily and he wanted to give his first concert with me, which was earlier than I had intended to.</span> <span id="s373">But he wanted to present me to the public, so he gave a combined concert.</span> <span id="s374">In between the first operation, but he knew there was a chance that it would come back, and it did.</span> <span id="s375">So, he had a second attack of the cancer, of which he did.</span> <span id="s376">I found out later that there was a lot more that happened in between.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: In the early 30s how much had you been aware of the change in the political climate, and what was going on in Germany after 1933?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: I had been very interested in all political things that were happening in the world, and the reason that I was even more aware of it than the average Dutchman, I had a Russian co- student in my study and my father had the conservatory, she had voice lessons there.</span> <span id="s379">She was a Russian family, what we called "White Russians."</span> <span id="s380">You know what that means.</span> <span id="s381">They had escaped the communism when she and her sister and her parents, she and her sister were under 20, in their teens.</span> <span id="s382">In other words, the parents had taken the two girls out of the country, and they were not adults yet, but she was engaged secretly to an older person, who was a very prominent man in Russia.</span> <span id="s383">He was what we called and what Holland would call a minister of the money.</span> <span id="s384">He had a high communist job.</span> <span id="s385">So, they had really turned the girl away from Russia.</span> <span id="s386">So, of course, you become interested in what's going in the world if you have a Russian best friend.</span> <span id="s387">She wanted to get there when she was 21.</span> <span id="s388">I think that was being major in Holland.</span> <span id="s389">I was only 17 or 18, but we were very thick friends, and I loved her to pieces.</span> <span id="s390">I really wanted to do anything for her, and she was getting sadder and sadder because her fiance didn't believe what she wrote that the Dutch authorities would not even give her her papers when she became 21.</span> <span id="s391">The reason they didn't want to give her the papers was because she was a Russian refugee, and she should be happy to be accepted by the Dutch and all that and so forth and so on.</span> <span id="s392">And I thought this was the most uncalled for action.</span> <span id="s393">She was 21.</span> <span id="s394">She was an adult.</span> <span id="s395">She should be able to make her own life, and when I saw something like that, I got busy.</span> <span id="s396">I said I'll help you.</span> <span id="s397">I'll get you to Russia.</span> <span id="s398">At first she didn't think so, well, I did.</span> <span id="s399">That was my first false passport that I made.</span> <span id="s400">I saved my money.</span> <span id="s401">I got another friend to help me.</span> <span id="s402">I saved more money and I got her out of the house secretly at 6:00 in the morning.</span> <span id="s403">I did everything, and I got her to the train and I put her secretly, the clothes that she had to take in the depot at the Central Station at 6:00.</span> <span id="s404">I shared my bedroom with my sister Renee and I bossed her, just like my father bossed everybody.</span> <span id="s405">I said in no word am I getting up at 5:00 tomorrow morning.</span> <span id="s406">No word to the family.</span> <span id="s407">Nobody should know that I get out of the house, and I did.</span> <span id="s408">And I got her to be quiet.</span> <span id="s409">She was always afraid if I talked like that, even though I was her younger sister.</span> <span id="s410">And I got her out of the house, and I got her to the Central Station, and I got back home.</span> <span id="s411">And after a week, I got a letter from Berlin, from Ellen, my friend, that she's stuck and she hasn't heard anything from Russia, and she doesn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s412">This was the time that my father was in the hospital, and every time I wanted to do something, my father always said it was okay, and my mother always said ask your father.</span> <span id="s413">She never said okay, and I was still living with my mother, but I was on my own.</span> <span id="s414">And I went to the hospital and I asked my father, and I said I wanted to find Ellen, and he said, I want you to find Ellen.</span> <span id="s415">Yes, but I'm not telling you where I'm going.</span> <span id="s416">And he said, that's okay.</span> <span id="s417">I said, parents all stick together, and I want to stick with her, and I said I'm not going to tell you I went to Berlin to keep her company, and I promised my father if I can and he's not following through I will bring her back, and he said I hope you will.</span> <span id="s418">I did go to Berlin with the night train and I got out, Sunday morning at 6:00 in the morning, and I didn't even have an address.</span> <span id="s419">I only knew she was with a cousin from , that three brothers lived on the Berlin on the .</span> <span id="s420">That's all I knew.</span> <span id="s421">At 7:00 in the morning I stood on the in Berlin.</span> <span id="s422">Do you know what that means?</span> <span id="s423">Houses and more houses and I didn't even know where I was.</span> <span id="s424">Do you know what I did?</span> <span id="s425">I went to the police officer in the neighborhood, and I said do you have anybody with three brothers, Russian brothers that live here by the name of Robinowitz (ph)?</span> <span id="s426">Do you have anybody here?</span> <span id="s427">And he looked and he said yes, I have an address for you.</span> <span id="s428">It was not where she was, but it was one of the other brothers.</span> <span id="s429">I stayed with her in Berlin, and I went back then finally to .</span> <span id="s430">I didn't bring her back, but I didn't have to.</span> <span id="s431">She got married to that man.</span> <span id="s432">I met that man.</span> <span id="s433">It's all in my history.</span> <span id="s434">I mean I have pictures of her with that man.</span> <span id="s435">His name was Sasha Nuvitsky (ph).</span> <span id="s436">He had come to in Germany later to meet him.</span> <span id="s437">That's just one little aside, but that's why I was interested in what happened in the world.</span> <span id="s438">I knew what happened in the world.</span> <span id="s439">I usually knew these things.</span> <span id="s440">I knew also when the war hit Holland.</span> <span id="s441">I knew exactly what had happened in Germany because I was living that life with her in Russia.</span> <span id="s442">I knew about life in the world, not life in Holland.</span> <span id="s443">It was only in my mind a tiny little corner.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: What did you think in 1933 when Hitler --?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: Well, I knew what was happening.</span> <span id="s446">I knew what was happening and I saw that as if it was happening everywhere.</span> <span id="s447">It was spreading right away.</span> <span id="s448">My teacher that I later had for conducting, which was one of the few group teachings I've had, was .</span> <span id="s449">He was a famous conductor in Germany.</span> <span id="s450">Not Jewish, but seriously against all what happened, and he left Germany and left a beautiful career and went to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s451">I later found him, because he was one of the few conductors that taught conducting.</span> <span id="s452">Most conductors don't teach.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: Did you feel in 1933, did you think that Holland would be threatened also?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s455">I was prepared for that.</span> <span id="s456">I saw it coming closer and closer, and when I had my vacation, just in 1940, Easter or something at that time, I was going to an island where I had a sort of a tete a tete.</span> <span id="s457">I have a cabin with friends and I had worked also with other friends.</span> <span id="s458">I had met the French ambassador through American friends of mine and they were involved in espionage, and we knew that it would be Germany that would attack Holland, although we supposedly don't know whether it's going to be England or going to be Germany, but I knew it was going to be Germany and that they needed to go to Holland to get to England and Northern France.</span> <span id="s459">So, it was expected by us, I mean people who think a little bit.</span> <span id="s460">It was not a surprise to me.</span> <span id="s461">Nothing that happened in 1940 was a surprise.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: How much did you know when we go a little bit before we talk about 1940.</span> <span id="s463">How much did you know in the mid 30s about what was going on in Germany about persecution?</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: Everything, everything, because I knew what happened between Russia and what happened between Russia and Germany and what happened in the world.</span> <span id="s465">I mean I wasn't concerned what happened in Holland.</span> <span id="s466">I sat next to a high military man on the ferry boat that got me to on the day before my birthday, which was May 9th.</span> <span id="s467">I took my convertible up to the island of where I used to spend my vacations.</span> <span id="s468">I also had a couple of people, friends, who were raising flower bulbs, involved in espionage thing I had going with friends, an American woman married to a Dutchman who was working for the American Embassy up to the War.</span> <span id="s469">That's another story.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: We've had your family background and your education to the moment your father died in 1923.</span> <span id="s472">We heard that you were like the only one within your brother and your sisters who was really musically talented.</span> <span id="s473">So, what happened in the next ten years after 1923?</span> <span id="s474">What was your education?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: Well, the education was really finished when my father died, because I had had my musical education since I was ten.</span> <span id="s476">I started with the cello when I was nine or ten.</span> <span id="s477">I had kept that up.</span> <span id="s478">He was a very bad teacher.</span> <span id="s479">My father didn't know anything about strings.</span> <span id="s480">He was a wonderful pianist, but he didn't have a very wide knowledge about the other people and how they taught.</span> <span id="s481">He was a good teacher himself, but the funny things is, that he didn't, had to go with what went.</span> <span id="s482">My second teacher, the first did nothing much, but the second one was the first cellist of orchestra, but he was a jerk.</span> <span id="s483">He was a funny guy, and he was also a teacher at Conservatory, and he was a four flusher if there ever was one.</span> <span id="s484">He was never on time.</span> <span id="s485">He would be very jovial and say, "All of you kids are waiting for me?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Wonderful," because he was an hour and a half late for his lesson.</span> <span id="s487">He wanted to marry me because he was a widower.</span> <span id="s488">His wife had committed suicide.</span> <span id="s489">When I knew him better, I could understand that.</span> <span id="s490">It was a farce.</span> <span id="s491">The whole man was a farce, but he had a big cello, and he had his big hand around the cello neck, like this, big tune teaching was absolutely nil.</span> <span id="s492">He told my father stories that he could take me to Brussels, and I could cook.</span> <span id="s493">Come out in six months with the first prize.</span> <span id="s494">This was all stories.</span> <span id="s495">It didn't amount to anything.</span> <span id="s496">So, the first one was mediocre.</span> <span id="s497">The second one was the first cellist, but he was kind of -- and I had only -- my father was still alive, and I had only a couple of hundred dollars left, because the money was completely gone.</span> <span id="s498">With his two operations, and he was very ill.</span> <span id="s499">I went and asked my father, I said, "I would like to go to Paris, because I've heard a cellist which I think is absolutely wonderful."</span> <span id="s500">His name was .</span> <span id="s501">He had some Dutch background also.</span> <span id="s502">He was a world famous cellist.</span> <span id="s503">And, I went to Paris because my father always said yes, if I asked him something.</span> <span id="s504">My mother said ask your father, and my father said yes.</span> <span id="s505">He let me completely decided what I wanted to do with my life.</span> <span id="s506">I never had a no from my father.</span> <span id="s507">I went to Paris.</span> <span id="s508">I wrote a letter to , and I got a note back, yes, he would be there.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">I came in with my music, and he was still not ready for me.</span> <span id="s510">He said, "Play something."</span> <span id="s511">So, when the curtain went up, I played something.</span> <span id="s512">He came in and he looked not very pleased with what he heard, and he didn't seem to be in a good mood.</span> <span id="s513">And I thought oh my God.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Well, he said, "What else do you have?"</span> <span id="s515">He looked at my music stand, I had put my music in there.</span> <span id="s516">I said, "Well, I have this."</span> <span id="s517">He said, "Play that."</span> <span id="s518">And I played it, and he said, "That you can't play.</span> <span id="s519">What else do you have?"</span> <span id="s520">So, I took another piece, and he said, "That you can't play either.</span> <span id="s521">What can you play?"</span> <span id="s522">And I said, "Nothing.</span> <span id="s523">That's why I'm here."</span> <span id="s524">Suddenly, his face just started to brighten when I said that.</span> <span id="s525">He said, "No wonder!</span> <span id="s526">No wonder, you hold your bow wrong.</span> <span id="s527">You hold your left hand wrong.</span> <span id="s528">With these short fingers how can you do it.</span> <span id="s529">You have to be up here.</span> <span id="s530">And how about this bow?"</span> <span id="s531">And I said, "Well, my teachers said I have to hold with these two fingers."</span> <span id="s532">So, to end the story, it only last for a few days.</span> <span id="s533">I had money for five days in Paris, and I came back a couple of times.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">He was the dearest person of the teachers for me.</span> <span id="s535">He became a very good friend.</span> <span id="s536">He has had me as a houseguest.</span> <span id="s537">He has had me for dinner.</span> <span id="s538">I have had an apartment of a co-student that he had had, who was very wealthy, who let me have her apartment in Paris in my summer vacations.</span> <span id="s539">I was his houseguest.</span> <span id="s540">He didn't give me lessons, he just had me in the house, and we became friends, very dear friends.</span> <span id="s541">He met later my husband, and he gave a cello class in my home, when I was married.</span> <span id="s542">In other words, he's part of my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: You started to tell me, I think if I remember, that after the death of your father, you also had to make a living?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: We were poor as a church mouse.</span> <span id="s545">Q: What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: Well, my best friend, girl friend, was a composer of whom they have made a documentary, because she was a very talented composer.</span> <span id="s547">I met her when she was in her early twenties and I was only sixteen.</span> <span id="s548">The same four flusher marks who taught me to hold my cello like this, had a love affair with her, and I was a high admirer of this wonderful, beautiful looking girl, composer.</span> <span id="s549">She is younger, four or five years younger.</span> <span id="s550">One time, after my lesson, said -- my lesson wasn't much, but it was over, he said, "I'm going your way.</span> <span id="s551">Would you like to walk with me?"</span> <span id="s552">in Amsterdam and she lived there.</span> <span id="s553">He had to go somewhere.</span> <span id="s554">That's where he went.</span> <span id="s555">I had met her very much, I knew her, but you know, we weren't friends.</span> <span id="s556">But that day, we became friends.</span> <span id="s557">He came in, and I can still see him with his winter coat on.</span> <span id="s558">He didn't even take that off, and he put a package on the mantel and he left.</span> <span id="s559">I lived one block away from where she did.</span> <span id="s560">And he said, "Are you coming with me or do you want stay?"</span> <span id="s561">And I said, "I'll stay."</span> <span id="s562">And I don't know why I said it, because I had no right to stay.</span> <span id="s563">I just came with him as his student that lived the next block.</span> <span id="s564">But I saw her face completely freeze, what is this brat doing here.</span> <span id="s565">She is staying here.</span> <span id="s566">And she looked at him as if she could murder him, and I felt something in the atmosphere like she was just as white as a sheet.</span> <span id="s567">And he left.</span> <span id="s568">And I thought, why am I here?</span> <span id="s569">I didn't know at first.</span> <span id="s570">And I saw that she was -- didn't know how to get rid of me.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">And she didn't.</span> <span id="s572">And I looked at her and suddenly I said to her, "Why don't you tell me everything?"</span> <span id="s573">And she did.</span> <span id="s574">That was that he had cheated her.</span> <span id="s575">He had more than one woman on the line and that she thought that she was pregnant.</span> <span id="s576">And what he had put on the mantel was some medicine that he had promised to bring her to get rid of the pregnancy.</span> <span id="s577">And why was she pregnant, because he had said that if they hadn't tried out whether they would fit, then he wouldn't be interested, and it was an absolute way out to get rid of her, because I knew that he had another liaison with some violinist of Orchestra, by the name of Betsy Slick.</span> <span id="s578">I never forget because I know what's going on for some reason, I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Because as a sixteen year old that doesn't know her very well, and she was already a known composer and had already written a cello concerto for him.</span> <span id="s580">And then to say, "Why don't you tell me everything?"</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: Why did you stay?</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: Because I felt that there was something for me to do.</span> <span id="s583">She told me that story, and I kind of took her a little closer to me and she said, "Why did you stay?"</span> <span id="s584">Because she said "You'll take the whole load off of me.</span> <span id="s585">I have a feeling like I'm on a submarine with you.</span> <span id="s586">I don't think of him anymore.</span> <span id="s587">I don't know what it is."</span> <span id="s588">I said, "Well, I do, because I love you, and I know you're suffering."</span> <span id="s589">She said, "Are you coming back?"</span> <span id="s590">I said, "Yes, after dinner."</span> <span id="s591">I had to go home because my mother expects me for dinner.</span> <span id="s592">And that's how our friendship started.</span> <span id="s593">We had lived together for seven years.</span> <span id="s594">She was a very talented and very attractive person in the beginning.</span> <span id="s595">But she was very egocentric.</span> <span id="s596">And she called me Mommy and Pops.</span> <span id="s597">She didn't call me by my name.</span> <span id="s598">Mommy and Pops was father and mother.</span> <span id="s599">She had never seen her father.</span> <span id="s600">He died when she was in the cradle, and her mother was very possessive.</span> <span id="s601">I want to know where my daughter is, and I want to know where my daughter was last night.</span> <span id="s602">She was one of the head piano teachers of the Conservatory.</span> <span id="s603">She was a very busy woman.</span> <span id="s604">A very talented piano teacher, but she was bossy.</span> <span id="s605">Her only child, and because I felt she needed a little protection, and so I've always had this feeling that where's there a need, I want to help.</span> <span id="s606">You know, I got Ellen to Russia to meet her fiance.</span> <span id="s607">I've always been an outgoing person, and I've always been a doer.</span> <span id="s608">I just have to do something.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: Did you live together in these seven years?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: Yes, and she had several men friends.</span> <span id="s611">She was very attractive, which was fine with me.</span> <span id="s612">But Mommy and Pops, I had to defend her against her mother, who was so bossy.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: When did you meet her exactly?</span> <span id="s614">Was it when you were sixteen?</span> <span id="s615">A: Seventeen, maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: 1921?</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: And then you moved out of your mother's house?</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s620">I was out of my mother's house from '17 on because I lived in Holland in a one room.</span> <span id="s621">See, what happened, this was before my father died.</span> <span id="s622">I met before my father died, because he died in '23.</span> <span id="s623">I met her when I was studying with , and I had come to Brussels to study and had come to Brussels to be with me, and took me to go out to dinner for a couple times and then went back to Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s624">But, I got, when my father died, I got a job because had a cousin who was the conductor of Orchestra, and that's my first job that I got already before my father died, because there was no money any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: What did you do in Holland?</span> <span id="s626">What was the first job?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: I played the cello, and when I became friends with , that was the time that my father was in the hospital.</span> <span id="s628">I knew her already.</span> <span id="s629">We talked about that time, but we never mentioned my friendships and my relationships.</span> <span id="s630">When I met her, I was ready to make money, because there was no money when my father was in the hospital all the time.</span> <span id="s631">So, all the money that we had went for the illness.</span> <span id="s632">So, everybody had to make a living.</span> <span id="s633">And Renee, my sister, who had such a fabulous memory, in one half year got her diploma to be a school teacher.</span> <span id="s634">And I had the cello, and was the one who said I'll take you to my cousin who is , who is the conductor in Holland.</span> <span id="s635">And she took me there and, of course, he engaged me.</span> <span id="s636">So, I had a job when I was seventeen, and I moved to Holland.</span> <span id="s637">And I was on my own.</span> <span id="s638">Of course, I was always on my own because I did it always the way I wanted to it anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: And then you moved back to Amsterdam to live with her?</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s641">There was an electric train, so I went -- sometimes I was in Amsterdam overnight.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">When I had my friendship with her, she lived in some rooms that she had and I lived in Holland.</span> <span id="s643">But sometimes I had a day off and I would go to Amsterdam, which means nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: Did you ever grow up together?</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: She wrote a second cello concerto and dedicated it to me, and I played that even for , but that fell through, because all the cellos of the concert orchestra go to the kids having an extra rehearsal for this concerto that she wrote.</span> <span id="s646">I almost played it in Amsterdam, but I played it in on the .</span> <span id="s647">I played it in other places, but she dedicated it to me, because we became very fast friends after that.</span> <span id="s648">Sometimes I stayed in Amsterdam, sometimes she would come to Holland.</span> <span id="s649">It all depended on who was free.</span> <span id="s650">And then later, we rented a flat at the corner -- well, it doesn't matter.</span> <span id="s651">We had an apartment together.</span> <span id="s652">But we stayed overnight sometimes to just be together, for the weekend or something.</span> <span id="s653">And she saved all this, she had a room and board and she always got a lot of fruit, and I can live on fruit.</span> <span id="s654">I don't have to have anything else.</span> <span id="s655">And she would save that for me, and she would put those dishes in the closet.</span> <span id="s656">And in the morning I had to get the train to get to Holland, to the rehearsal at 9:00, so I would get up early and live on this stored fruit, ice cold.</span> <span id="s657">That was my breakfast.</span> <span id="s658">When I went to Holland I had the rehearsal at 9:00, summer or winter.</span> <span id="s659">I was even there when was hired.</span> <span id="s660">I was demoted because was the great cellist, and of course, I have no hands to play the cello.</span> <span id="s661">But my father didn't even know that hands had to be big enough.</span> <span id="s662">I had a double joint here.</span> <span id="s663">I had to work very hard to hold my own cello.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: You said you lived together for seven years?</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: Actually, we met John Falcon (ph), who became my husband, and he was the one who put me a little bit more on my own feet.</span> <span id="s666">He said, you do always if you know nothing and you've always arranged it for other people for things to go well, but he said, you're a musician yourself.</span> <span id="s667">You need to get a little bit -- he picked me up and I played in a movie theater, one of those silent movies to make money.</span> <span id="s668">He said you have to attend to your own self.</span> <span id="s669">That's when I met to boost my ego a little bit about my music.</span> <span id="s670">See, I felt that I was small talent and my hands were not right.</span> <span id="s671">So, I didn't spend much time for myself ever.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Then came to visit us and admired Falcon very much, because he was a wonderful flute player, the best I ever heard in my life.</span> <span id="s673">But he could play forever, but he was asocial, I mean, he didn't care about moneymaking.</span> <span id="s674">He didn't care about his clothes.</span> <span id="s675">He didn't care how late he went to bed.</span> <span id="s676">He would practice until 2:00 in the morning.</span> <span id="s677">He was a real Bohemian.</span> <span id="s678">But he made up his mind that he couldn't live without me, and he wanted to marry me.</span> <span id="s679">And I said, "I'm not the marrying type really."</span> <span id="s680">And he said, "I don't want to live without you."</span> <span id="s681">And one time he came in with a revolver and he put it on the mantle and I said, "What are you trying to do?"</span> <span id="s682">And he said, "I don't want to live without you."</span> <span id="s683">I said, "I told you I'm not really the marrying kind.</span> <span id="s684">I don't think I can love a man that way.</span> <span id="s685">I don't think so.</span> <span id="s686">I just always have great admiration for women."</span> <span id="s687">He said, "Well, that's what it is.</span> <span id="s688">I want to be where you are."</span> <span id="s689">So, I said, "Well, I guess we better get married."</span> <span id="s690">And we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">As soon as we were married, he was changed.</span> <span id="s692">He had been very happy, very playful, very outgoing, nonsense making, like a .</span> <span id="s693">If someone had a glass of beer, he would stick his finger in foam.</span> <span id="s694">I mean he was always doing something naughty, funny.</span> <span id="s695">When we were married, he got less and less happy.</span> <span id="s696">To make a long story short, because there's not much to tell, because he never spoke about anything that went on inside of him.</span> <span id="s697">If I said something about his nature, would you like this or you're very fond of so and so, he would say no.</span> <span id="s698">In other words, he could not be open.</span> <span id="s699">He could not be touched.</span> <span id="s700">His inner life was his.</span> <span id="s701">And so we became quieter and quieter.</span> <span id="s702">We never had an argument, and we were so outwardly happy, a couple.</span> <span id="s703">I mean I was happy and he was happy, because he was playing the flute, always and always.</span> <span id="s704">He was teaching.</span> <span id="s705">We lived in my house, where I was before.</span> <span id="s706">He moved in with me, and so and that was the time that my half brother was very ill and had brain cancer and was dying.</span> <span id="s707">There was another moment of financial trouble because of his being sick and not having any money.</span> <span id="s708">So, I wanted to get all of us together, my sister and my brother, who was a doctor, and do something financially all together for him, for the sick half brother.</span> <span id="s709">And I said, "Joe, I have to talk to you."</span> <span id="s710">And he said, "Not now."</span> <span id="s711">And a couple of times later, I said to Joe, "I would like to talk to you."</span> <span id="s712">And when he said again that he didn't have time.</span> <span id="s713">Then I said, "Well I guess I have to make my own decision," because we both were making money.</span> <span id="s714">And he said "I don't know what the difference is."</span> <span id="s715">And I said, "What do you mean?</span> <span id="s716">Do you want a divorce?"</span> <span id="s717">And he said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s718">I said, "Why didn't you speak up?"</span> <span id="s719">And he said, "Well, you wouldn't have understood."</span> <span id="s720">I said, "You give it one chance."</span> <span id="s721">He said, "Well, you wouldn't understand it."</span> <span id="s722">I said, "Well, it would be fairer to give it one chance."</span> <span id="s723">He said, "I've never felt comfortable with you."</span> <span id="s724">I said, "Maybe I do understand."</span> <span id="s725">And that was all that was ever said.</span> <span id="s726">I moved out.</span> <span id="s727">I went to my mother who lived a half a block down.</span> <span id="s728">I still remember how I walked out.</span> <span id="s729">I had put prunes and apricots and I took the pan with me because I knew that he didn't need it, and I moved into my mother's place, and I said, "Mom, would you like me to come live with you for a while?"</span> <span id="s730">And I said, "We're going to have a divorce."</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: You said that you understand that he didn't feel comfortable with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: Yes, because I'm just the opposite of what he is.</span> <span id="s733">I am an open person, and I'm a very romantic person and I'm telling people exactly how I am and what I am not.</span> <span id="s734">I said it is not a good idea to get married, and it wasn't.</span> <span id="s735">But he said, no matter what I do, no matter what I feel, no matter what I say, he would say I just don't want to live without you.</span> <span id="s736">Now, what do you do when a person threatens you with a revolver.</span> <span id="s737">I mean, I was in a way very grateful for his love and for his devotion to make me into some musician.</span> <span id="s738">We had a quintet with .</span> <span id="s739">We played music, I played with a concert with him and the harpsichord and flute and viola.</span> <span id="s740">We did things together.</span> <span id="s741">He had an orchestra and he wanted to be a conductor and I let him do that.</span> <span id="s742">I encouraged him, but he was not a conductor, because he was unable to be a leader.</span> <span id="s743">He was not a leader.</span> <span id="s744">He would ask to play softer with a finger on his nose like this and say, it's still too loud.</span> <span id="s745">I said, "Why don't you swear a little and say for God's sake, can't you play it piamissio."</span> <span id="s746">He tried to be a conductor.</span> <span id="s747">He had the ears of a musician.</span> <span id="s748">I have not heard anything like it.</span> <span id="s749">His musicianship was absolutely fabulous, but he was not pushing anything.</span> <span id="s750">And he said, "I don't pay them."</span> <span id="s751">I said, "You don't have to pay them to play soft."</span> <span id="s752">Musicians should be playing soft, but he was not a fighter.</span> <span id="s753">And he would always say no when I would say you're this or you're that or -- he had a great admiration for , the composer.</span> <span id="s754">They all took lessons from and took lessons from and took lessons and took lessons.</span> <span id="s755">That was the time that all these young gentlemen -- in the 40s.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q: When did you marry and when did you get a divorce?</span></p> <p><span id="s758">A: I think I married in '31 and it was a very informal marriage.</span> <span id="s759">No party, we just walked to the office where you have to sign certain papers.</span> <span id="s760">There was no fuss, no bother, because we just wanted for ourselves, we wanted to have that license.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Q: It was a license?</span></p> <p><span id="s762">A: Oh, yes, we were married.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: And you were divorced when?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: Five years later, in '36.</span> <span id="s765">It went very amiable.</span> <span id="s766">I was very fond of his mother and his sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">He had been catholic, but he wasn't catholic.</span> <span id="s768">His mother and his sister was catholic and they lived in , and we had a nice time in the beginning.</span> <span id="s769">He told me all the things about his life, and he brought me home to his family.</span> <span id="s770">We have been on friendly terms ever since.</span> <span id="s771">We have not visited because it is a little painful for him.</span> <span id="s772">I asked him, "Do you want to make music together, regardless.</span> <span id="s773">I mean, if I continue to be your friend?"</span> <span id="s774">He said, "No."</span> <span id="s775">He would rather have us not see each other.</span> <span id="s776">And he stayed with that in the beginning very strictly for his own good I'm sure.</span> <span id="s777">He wanted to get over.</span> <span id="s778">Because it was a break, and he said to me, "I've never said that I didn't love you."</span> <span id="s779">In fact, he went to his mother and his sister and said "We are getting a divorce, but I don't want you to change your feelings that you have for Frieda because --" But he got married to an old school friend of mine, who was also a musician, and her father was a member of Orchestra.</span> <span id="s780">It was a couple that were friends of ours, they divorced at the same time we divorced, because there was something happening, something shifting between the husband and wife situation.</span> <span id="s781">I had a nice friendship with the violinist, who was married to his second wife, and his second wife, the violinist and I were old friends for a while.</span> <span id="s782">That's when it happened.</span> <span id="s783">That's when the shift happened.</span> <span id="s784">He fell in love with the violinist.</span> <span id="s785">The violinist and I were very good friends, but that was only very short lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: Did your marriage with John Falcon change your friendship with Henrietta ?</span></p> <p><span id="s787">A: Well, yes.</span> <span id="s788">She resented -- she was possessive, I was her private possession.</span> <span id="s789">Yet, when I said that I was going to get married, she said "I'll be there for breakfast."</span> <span id="s790">She thought I was her right, to have the part of me that she thought that she needed.</span> <span id="s791">Do you see what I mean?</span> <span id="s792">So, we stayed friends for a while, because he liked her.</span> <span id="s793">He liked her, he called her sweet, because he said she is so thin.</span> <span id="s794">I don't know how she got that name.</span> <span id="s795">He was friendly with her.</span> <span id="s796">I don't know what happened much later, because we kind of drifted apart.</span> <span id="s797">He didn't want to see me.</span> <span id="s798">He didn't want to make music with me anymore.</span> <span id="s799">He used to give concerts with other people, as I told you.</span> <span id="s800">He wanted to cut it off.</span> <span id="s801">He wanted to get over me.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Q: Did your friendship with Henrietta diminish or --?</span></p> <p><span id="s803">A: She really pulled away gradually because she considered me kind of her private possession.</span> <span id="s804">Because she didn't make the room for me that he had made, so I was a little bit of a loss for a while, a little bit.</span> <span id="s805">I had some other friends that took over and, you know.</span> <span id="s806">I had other friendships that filled my life.</span> <span id="s807">I'm very romantic, and I go overboard with what I do for people.</span> <span id="s808">It's no half measure as far as I'm concerned.</span> <span id="s809">So, I've had other relationships, but not right away.</span> <span id="s810">That didn't break it up.</span> <span id="s811">That was already there.</span> <span id="s812">I had already strong ties with other people.</span> <span id="s813">And that's what he said was fine.</span> <span id="s814">It was fine, but it wasn't fine, and it wasn't enough for him.</span> <span id="s815">He needed somebody that looked up to him.</span> <span id="s816">He married the second time, then there was another five years for him, which I didn't participate in at all, and then he married for a third time.</span> <span id="s817">For the third time, he married some woman who was a very strict catholic, whose mother I played with who was also a musician, and the girl was 12 years old when Joe and I were married.</span> <span id="s818">She was student of his in her teens.</span> <span id="s819">I remember that one of the times that he was giving her a lesson, he gave her lessons while he was lying on his sofa.</span> <span id="s820">And I thought, this is kind of funny, because I would never lie on the sofa when I teach.</span> <span id="s821">But I didn't think too much of it.</span> <span id="s822">She was only 12 or 13 years old then, and then he married the violinist.</span> <span id="s823">I went to school with her, and I knew her since she was a girl.</span> <span id="s824">That failed.</span> <span id="s825">He got a divorce from her.</span> <span id="s826">Then, in the third period after that, he wrote me letters once in a while about musical things, and he wrote me that one time that I was going to Holland to see my mother again.</span> <span id="s827">He said that I'm playing that time that you're going to be in Holland.</span> <span id="s828">I'm playing in .</span> <span id="s829">He said, I can get a ticket for you although it is a sold out hall, but I'll get you a ticket if you want to go.</span> <span id="s830">I said, "Sure, I'd love to."</span> <span id="s831">I got the ticket, and I sat with his wife, because that was the only ticket he had, next to this third wife.</span> <span id="s832">I looked down in the hall and I thought this is funny, because people know me from the time I was playing the cello with him and people know his wife.</span> <span id="s833">I thought they will say there's Mrs. Falcon number 1 sitting next to Mrs. Falcon number 3.</span> <span id="s834">Isn't that a funny situation, because we were probably both known by the public.</span> <span id="s835">He said when we go home I would like you to come to the home to visit, and I did.</span> <span id="s836">So, we were on very good terms then.</span> <span id="s837">We went to the home when the concert was over -- I mean when the visit was over, he said "I'll walk you home" because my mother didn't live very far.</span> <span id="s838">I said, "No, I can walk alone."</span> <span id="s839">He said, "No, no, I will walk you."</span> <span id="s840">He put his winter coat on and we walked and I said, "Well, Joe, how was your second marriage?"</span> <span id="s841">He said, "Terrible, it was a mess.</span> <span id="s842">She was a mess."</span> <span id="s843">He was very happy, and he had come back to being strictly catholic, because that family was strictly catholic, which was a far cry from what he was before when we were married.</span> <span id="s844">His mother did this before she ate her dinner.</span> <span id="s845">He would say to his sister's kids, "Quiet can't you see Grandma is phoning the Lord."</span> <span id="s846">He was mocking.</span> <span id="s847">When he married, he married into a very strictly, strictly catholic family which surprised me no end.</span> <span id="s848">But he went all the way -- his whole character needed something else.</span> <span id="s849">He always claimed he needed me, he needed to be where I was.</span> <span id="s850">He wasn't -- we never were on the same wave length, do you know what I mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q: How was your musical career developing?</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: That was doing fine, much later.</span> <span id="s853">I've always been a persistent person.</span> <span id="s854">I don't take no for an answer.</span> <span id="s855">If it cannot be done, I would say, "We'll see."</span> <span id="s856">That's how I saved my life, because when I had to get out when all the other people were caught, except some weren't, myself, I decided I was endangering everyone who gave me shelter.</span> <span id="s857">My house was searched, and I found it after the war sealed and searched by the Gestapo, and it was in the hands of the Gestapo almost twice.</span> <span id="s858">The first time I could talk myself out of it and the second time I ran out of it, and you can read that in the paper that I gave you.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: We didn't talk about your professional life in the 30s before we come to the --?</span> <span id="s860">A: You can do that if you want.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q: How was your last -- you were starting in the Holland Orchestra and you were --?</span></p> <p><span id="s862">A: I was there for several years, and I was asked to play solo because I was the first cellist for the first years until came in.</span> <span id="s863">That's when I almost gave up that job.</span> <span id="s864">I did play solo with the orchestra and set a date, and then my father was almost dying.</span> <span id="s865">I had to postpone the date.</span> <span id="s866">Then, finally the conductor said, you better set a date and do it because your father lives much longer than the doctors predict, same here, and so, I set the date.</span> <span id="s867">Sure enough, I played on Thursday night, I played solo and there was a concert repeat on Sunday.</span> <span id="s868">I saw my father on Wednesday and I said, "I play tomorrow and I'll see you Friday," and I did.</span> <span id="s869">I played Thursday, and I visited him Friday and he said, he whispered "Do you play Sunday?"</span> <span id="s870">and I said, "Yes, I play Sunday afternoon."</span> <span id="s871">He died Saturday, and I did play Sunday, like in dream.</span> <span id="s872">I did play.</span> <span id="s873">But, after that soon some very dramatic things happened, maybe I'll talk to you about later.</span> <span id="s874">Do you want me --?</span></p> <p><span id="s875">Q: I would like to have an overview.</span> <span id="s876">You were playing as a cellist, but did you work in Amsterdam?</span> <span id="s877">When did you get involved in conducting?</span> <span id="s878">I don't know this part, but especially in the 30s.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">A: This all happened in 1923.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: Can you move forward in time?</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: A big drama happened right after he had died, and he had talked to me about that, that he very much of a fear that his girlfriend, who was the daughter of the professor, that I was talking about before, was in love with me and he had an affair with, which was very much against the wish of her parents, because he was so much older.</span> <span id="s882">He was 53 when he died, and she was in her early 20s.</span> <span id="s883">But he was very much of a vital, working man, until he got sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">But, he was sick for about three years because of his repeat cancer.</span> <span id="s885">He was in his late 40s when he started the affair with this woman.</span> <span id="s886">He was telling only me that he was afraid that she wouldn't want to live if he died.</span> <span id="s887">I said, "Oh, Dad, people say that, but they'll get over it."</span> <span id="s888">I don't think in her case she did.</span> <span id="s889">She committed suicide right after he died.</span> <span id="s890">She was a strange woman with a fixed side to her character, and he knew that.</span> <span id="s891">That was something I only found out after it happened.</span> <span id="s892">And she did it in his house, in his room, and my mother found her.</span> <span id="s893">They had to smuggle out the corpse.</span> <span id="s894">The parents didn't want to have a notice, not even in the paper, that she died or nothing.</span> <span id="s895">It was all hushed for years, because I know the parents.</span> <span id="s896">They're not alive anymore.</span> <span id="s897">She had some brothers, and they took care of it.</span> <span id="s898">They took care of all of the ramifications and my half brother helped my mother with the situation she found.</span> <span id="s899">Because, I told you, my parents weren't ever not on speaking terms, so my mother went down there, because she thought maybe she could do something after her ex- husband died and didn't know what she would find.</span> <span id="s900">All these things are so terribly dramatic and sad.</span> <span id="s901">You can't imagine all this going on in a life, but it all belongs together.</span> <span id="s902">We still have to come to what happened to my brother.</span> <span id="s903">It's the second suicide that happened in my family, in my close range.</span> <span id="s904">Do you understand what I'm saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q: I think I want to talk about your brother later.</span> <span id="s906">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">Q: Can you give me an impression of how you lived in the 30s, you were doing musical stuff, but also how much did you discuss with your friends, what was going on in politics in Germany, in Holland, excuse me.</span> <span id="s908">Can you tell us about the changes after 1933, did you discuss with your friends what was going on in Germany after 1933?</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: Yes, I can tell you about it.</span> <span id="s910">People are usually kind of escaping that.</span> <span id="s911">They didn't like to talk about it.</span> <span id="s912">I knew about it and the more it came close, the more I discussed it.</span> <span id="s913">People were afraid that the Germans would just walk over Holland and things would happen.</span> <span id="s914">But we did discuss, especially the artists were the friends that I had.</span> <span id="s915">I mean, they were almost all in the arts.</span> <span id="s916">Like the people you have seen that gave their life for it, but many of the artists were thinking about .</span> <span id="s917">We knew it existed in Germany, and we talked about, and what it meant.</span> <span id="s918">meant that you had to follow rules and that it was against all Jews and you couldn't play Jewish music for the musicians and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">Q: Was there also anti-semitism right after 1933 in Holland?</span> <span id="s920">A: Yes, we knew that.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">Q: Also in the Netherlands?</span></p> <p><span id="s922">A: There was some and there was a discussion very often about people that said "It's different in Holland.</span> <span id="s923">They are not against the Jews.</span> <span id="s924">They are just Russian Socialists.</span> <span id="s925">They are Socialists.</span> <span id="s926">They are not against the Jews."</span> <span id="s927">That's what they say now, but wait until they feel that they are on top.</span> <span id="s928">That isn't openly admitted.</span> <span id="s929">There were members that argue about it.</span> <span id="s930">In fact, we saw parades, you know, demonstrations, people along the street promoting the , and we said well, that's what they say now.</span> <span id="s931">But don't you see, they have Jewish people walking in those demonstrations.</span> <span id="s932">Yes, because they did not want it to be the same way in Holland.</span> <span id="s933">I said how naive can you be.</span> <span id="s934">You can't believe that.</span> <span id="s935">Everybody that says it is not going to be against Jews is just to get the movement going.</span> <span id="s936">So, I never believed that you could tell everybody honestly it's different.</span> <span id="s937">It's not different.</span> <span id="s938">It's just little by little and don't believe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: Were you ever confronted by anti-semitism because your father was Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: No, I never thought about it.</span> <span id="s941">We never thought about it, because neither of the parents was very religious.</span> <span id="s942">And as I said, my father said you believe what you want to believe, and I believed that it was beyond my comprehension.</span> <span id="s943">To me, we have no comprehension what is beyond us and I still feel that way.</span> <span id="s944">I don't know where to go beyond what we have.</span> <span id="s945">We only have five senses.</span> <span id="s946">There are animals that have much more senses.</span> <span id="s947">I mean elephants know more than we do in certain directions.</span> <span id="s948">And bats do, and insects do and they say it's instinct, but it comes from somewhere.</span> <span id="s949">But I can't talk to them, so we live in different worlds, so how can you say -- that's why I sometimes laughingly say I'll ask the beard, and the beard is my concept of God.</span> <span id="s950">It's a popularized somebody, the pope and the beard is the same.</span> <span id="s951">We manufacture some being that is bigger than we are and wiser than we are, but we don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q: Beyond religion, your family name Belinfante, did you ever have difficulty?</span></p> <p><span id="s953">A: Oh yes, some people knew that there was Jews and they're different from Polish Jews, and I said I don't know, to me all human beings are the same and they're all different.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Q: But you were never disliked as a person because people said Belinfante, you must be Jewish so that pupils, students --?</span></p> <p><span id="s955">A: No, we didn't talk about it.</span> <span id="s956">We never had much talk going on and never even felt that people -- when I grew up in Holland in the first half of my life there was no conversation about anti- Jewish people.</span> <span id="s957">I have always avoided religious conversations because I didn't know what would offend people.</span> <span id="s958">The best thing to do is to leave people alone to have their own solution about it.</span> <span id="s959">And if that's what you want to -- I had a conversation one time with a woman who wanted to get to understand what I was thinking, and she always -- we were told, and I said, "I'm not asking what you were told, what are you thinking, what do you feel?"</span> <span id="s960">And she would just say, "Well, I was told" and I said "I don't go by what I was told because what I am told is what somebody else thinks.</span> <span id="s961">I think what I think is just as good."</span> <span id="s962">And I've always taken that attitude.</span> <span id="s963">My opinion is just as a good as yours.</span> <span id="s964">I said that to my father also.</span> <span id="s965">He never said to me you had to do this or that or had think this or that.</span> <span id="s966">He said to read, you can read about things and make up your own mind.</span> <span id="s967">That was one time he was telling me that somebody has seen you and asked me is your daughter engaged and I said, "Why did they ask you?"</span> <span id="s968">And he said, "They had seen you walk arm in arm with a boy and people don't do that unless they are engaged."</span> <span id="s969">I said, "Oh, they don't?</span> <span id="s970">I do."</span> <span id="s971">He never said don't do it.</span> <span id="s972">I said, if I do it, and I do, but I'm not engaged to this man.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">Q: I think I understand, but I want to know because with your name Frieda Belinfante --?</span></p> <p><span id="s974">A: Some people who do say that is a Jewish name.</span> <span id="s975">I say, "Yes, that's my father's name.</span> <span id="s976">That's where it comes from."</span> <span id="s977">But nothing else is discussed.</span> <span id="s978">I never had the feeling that I had to discuss it.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Q: But you were never confronted with anti-semitism personally?</span> <span id="s980">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">Q: Where people said, " You're Jewish, I don't want to have --?</span></p> <p><span id="s982">A: No, absolutely not.</span> <span id="s983">And not getting students and not getting relationships with parents, never had have it.</span> <span id="s984">It might have been hidden, but they never came out with it, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">Q: Do you think because you told us earlier that you told everyone well if you think socialism in the Netherlands is without anti-semitism you're wrong.</span> <span id="s986">It will come here slowly by slowly also.</span> <span id="s987">Was that because you had a Jewish background?</span></p> <p><span id="s988">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">Q: But you were more sensible to that, sensitive?</span></p> <p><span id="s990">A: I know what exists.</span> <span id="s991">I'm not blind for knowing that there must be people around that probably say it, but they wouldn't say it to my face, so I couldn't say that they said it.</span> <span id="s992">I have never been confronted with it.</span> <span id="s993">Never had people say, we'll you are half Jewish so I won't have anything to do with you, no.</span> <span id="s994">Personally, I have never felt that.</span> <span id="s995">If people have a conceived idea why they don't want to have anything to do with me, I'm not inquiring of trying to find out why, because if people don't want to have anything to do with me, that's fine with me, then it's not my kind of people.</span> <span id="s996">I mean, if people demonstrate any hostility without explaining it, well, they're free to choose.</span> <span id="s997">But I've never had it thrown at me, never been said at me.</span> <span id="s998">Never, not in any way.</span> <span id="s999">Maybe some people who analyzed me say, that is your Jewish side, that's not offensive.</span> <span id="s1000">But lots of times, people said why weren't you very much like your father.</span> <span id="s1001">And then I would point, yes I am.</span> <span id="s1002">I had friends that said for instance Belinfanting all over the place, and that means quit bossing me around or something.</span> <span id="s1003">But it never had to do anything with Jewish.</span> <span id="s1004">I don't meet with hostility that is anti-semitism, personally.</span> <span id="s1005">I can say that is a Jewish characteristic.</span> <span id="s1006">People say that is a very Jewish characteristic what you have and I'll say, "Oh, is it?"</span> <span id="s1007">I'm not even aware.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">Tape #5</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">Q: We stopped -- maybe you can explain to us how it developed that you became the first female conductor of a professional orchestra?</span> <span id="s1010">How it developed, this career?</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">A: Sure, I can easily do that.</span> <span id="s1012">Well, I did some conducting in schools, like teachers will do, like music teacher, singing teacher who do a little something.</span> <span id="s1013">I was asked by a parent of one of my students would I like to do a little of that, conduct a little choir of kids and maybe a little orchestra of the kids.</span> <span id="s1014">I said yes, and I went to see the principal and apparently he had two candidates for that high school.</span> <span id="s1015">One was a man and he happened to be one of our best friends.</span> <span id="s1016">This was during the time I had been married.</span> <span id="s1017">We had a very good music best friend of the family, a very musical family , who wrote a book about all the Bach pieces.</span> <span id="s1018">He was very knowledgeable.</span> <span id="s1019">He was asked and I was asked by this other mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">So, he had a male come to one of them and he said well they are awful these kids.</span> <span id="s1021">They are really just -- they're hooligans, as soon as the bell rings.</span> <span id="s1022">They are hard to handle so I think I am better off with a man.</span> <span id="s1023">So, he took the man, and it happened to be a friend of ours.</span> <span id="s1024">The school was not even in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s1025">It was in .</span> <span id="s1026">And I said, that's a change I can't make for you, so if you want a man, take Hans.</span> <span id="s1027">So, Hans took the job.</span> <span id="s1028">I didn't see him too much during those years, but when I run into him, I said "Hans, how are you doing at the high school?"</span> <span id="s1029">He said, "Oh, I give it up.</span> <span id="s1030">I can't stand it.</span> <span id="s1031">They are terrible, those kids.</span> <span id="s1032">It is too much for me."</span> <span id="s1033">Right after that I got a call from the head of the school, would I come in.</span> <span id="s1034">Am I still interested?</span> <span id="s1035">I said yes.</span> <span id="s1036">So, I did.</span> <span id="s1037">So, that's really where I conducted the first -- because I took those kids, and they were no problem at all to handle them.</span> <span id="s1038">Hans was such an easy going fellow, such a dreamer.</span> <span id="s1039">He couldn't handle that.</span> <span id="s1040">So, I gave a performance with those kids, and the students of Amsterdam, sung in the choir that I was conducting heard about that that I gave a performance of a piece by , which was called , and it was such a success.</span> <span id="s1041">The kids did a wonderful job.</span> <span id="s1042">So, I got a phone call from the singers of the Amsterdam University.</span> <span id="s1043">Would I conduct a choir?</span> <span id="s1044">I said, fine, I would.</span> <span id="s1045">So, I did that.</span> <span id="s1046">Then comes a big list of festivities, a big concerto hall.</span> <span id="s1047">I had to commission work.</span> <span id="s1048">I commissioned the work.</span> <span id="s1049">That became a big performance.</span> <span id="s1050">110 musicians and singers on stage.</span> <span id="s1051">That became a big affair.</span> <span id="s1052">So, I climbed up, but still there was no women conductors in orchestra.</span> <span id="s1053">After the performance was over, the students that had formed the nucleus of the strings of the orchestra, said I wish we could go on with this orchestra and maybe add something to it.</span> <span id="s1054">I said, well, why not.</span> <span id="s1055">So, we did.</span> <span id="s1056">So, finally I had an amateur orchestra with mostly not only girls, but doctors had joined it, and amateur players had joined it, so, when are we going to give a concert?</span> <span id="s1057">I said, well, soon, we can rent a small concerto hall and give a concert.</span> <span id="s1058">We did.</span> <span id="s1059">This all went during the 30s.</span> <span id="s1060">That concert, fortunately, was attended by an agent a Mrs. Boz (ph) head of concerts for all.</span> <span id="s1061">That meant cheap concerts.</span> <span id="s1062">She said to me, "We never find an orchestra when we need one."</span> <span id="s1063">Because she heard the concert and she said to me if you can do that with an amateur orchestra, can you imagine what you can do with professionals.</span> <span id="s1064">I said, "Well, I wouldn't get professionals to play for me."</span> <span id="s1065">She said, "Why not?</span> <span id="s1066">We need a small orchestra in Amsterdam and we don't have one."</span> <span id="s1067">I said, "Two people have tried it and it folded.</span> <span id="s1068">I wouldn't get anybody to play for me."</span> <span id="s1069">She said, "Why not try it.</span> <span id="s1070">If you try it and it is received well by the press, I have work for you."</span> <span id="s1071">I did.</span> <span id="s1072">So, I tried it.</span> <span id="s1073">I set a date, I rented a small hall.</span> <span id="s1074">One day, my best friend, hiding behind the newspaper that she was reading, said, "I have to talk to you."</span> <span id="s1075">I said, "Go ahead, talk."</span> <span id="s1076">She said, "You can't do that.</span> <span id="s1077">You have a good name as a cellist.</span> <span id="s1078">You can't just do that, get up there and say I'm a conductor.</span> <span id="s1079">Why would you be a conductor, you haven't even been trained as a conductor."</span> <span id="s1080">I said, "No, but I've had my eyes and ears open.</span> <span id="s1081">I think I can do it."</span> <span id="s1082">We did start that orchestra in May to rehearse and train, and I had the orchestra, but I had never performed in public with it.</span> <span id="s1083">She said if you do that, you're going to be canned.</span> <span id="s1084">You're going to be out as a cellist too.</span> <span id="s1085">You'll ruin the good reputation you have.</span> <span id="s1086">How would you be a conductor, you buy a baton and you are a conductor.</span> <span id="s1087">I said, "No, that's not exactly.</span> <span id="s1088">Anyway, thanks for your advice not to do it, but if I think I can do it, I will do it."</span> <span id="s1089">She said, if you get a good write up in the paper you're greater than .</span> <span id="s1090">I said, "I'll remind you of that."</span> <span id="s1091">So, anyway I did give the concert.</span> <span id="s1092">That was a November date, and it was very much a success.</span> <span id="s1093">We did well and I never had a score on the stage, everything from memory.</span> <span id="s1094">We had worked hard for it.</span> <span id="s1095">She had the I think and I had and the morning after the concert I heard my write up in my paper and she heard it in hers, and I went around the corner where she lived and we visited.</span> <span id="s1096">I said when I came in, she said to me, "How is your paper?"</span> <span id="s1097">I said, "Mine is fine."</span> <span id="s1098">She looked sheepishly at me and said, "So, is mine."</span> <span id="s1099">I said, now it could be better because we could use the write ups as publicity.</span> <span id="s1100">So that's how I named it , the Little Orchestra.</span> <span id="s1101">And we had several years of it, because the first performance was '38 and '39 and in '39 I went to Switzerland to study some more with my teacher , and in the end of twelve men and me, I won the first prize, which the first prize was to conduct the orchestra of the Swiss , but it never come off.</span> <span id="s1102">That was my prize.</span> <span id="s1103">That was the end of my conducting, because that was in 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">Q: When did you come back exactly to the Netherlands?</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">A: Well, I was back from Switzerland before, 1939, in the middle of '39, I was back in Holland when the war broke out.</span> <span id="s1106">Because I had already joined the group of and</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">and these people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">Q: What did this group do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">A: I had joined the cultural commission.</span> <span id="s1110">In other words I was approached by several years before '40, and I had acted a little different from , for instance because I wasn't trying to tell the other artists what to do.</span> <span id="s1111">He did and he tried to influence them don't cooperate with the Germans because they don't do anything now, but later on you will be railroaded in to doing this and that and the other and I must never do anything, because the moment the Germans got into the country, I said to the orchestra, "Boys, there is no orchestra.</span> <span id="s1112">We have never existed."</span> <span id="s1113">Because I knew that it would be a gradual process, and you don't know when to stop.</span> <span id="s1114">You get talked into it, and that is exactly what happened.</span> <span id="s1115">I completely disappeared from the musical life and immediately started to prepare myself to do other things that needed doing.</span> <span id="s1116">In other words, to ask people how they were standing politically.</span> <span id="s1117">I tried to feel my way with everybody, and who I could trust and who I couldn't trust and just continued teaching when that was possible.</span> <span id="s1118">Because there so many people so upset, and I had a fear of what would happen that I didn't teach that much even.</span> <span id="s1119">But, I completely withdrew from the public life.</span> <span id="s1120">I was asked then by during that period would I represent the musicians in his group.</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">Q: What was this group exactly?</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">A: It was the CKC that is written up in the book about .</span> <span id="s1123">Q: Can you just explain it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">A: That was following up what they for instance did and published and spread among artists don't do this and don't do that.</span> <span id="s1125">He was telling people that they would be gradually railroaded into the German cult.</span> <span id="s1126">That was only the beginning, and he wrote this letter, I think a monthly letter and asked me whether I would be part of their resistance group and represent the musicians.</span> <span id="s1127">Be the head of the group that would take care of the musicians.</span> <span id="s1128">Because what they did, there were many people that had to continue working to make a living.</span> <span id="s1129">If they couldn't work and do what the Germans told them to do, then they couldn't make a living.</span> <span id="s1130">So, they became immediately in need of support.</span> <span id="s1131">So, they had all prepared that, but we musicians didn't have that problem, because I was teaching.</span> <span id="s1132">So, I made a living, maybe a little less, but not considerably less.</span> <span id="s1133">So, I was a little bit more of an exception.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">did city assignments like wall paintings and murals and he had nothing.</span> <span id="s1135">So, he wouldn't make a living unless he would do what the occupational army prescribed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">Q: Can you explain what they prescribed and this Nazi German culture, what did they wish artists to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">A: Well, they had assembled funds for this opportunity to support.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">Q: No, what did the Germans do?</span> <span id="s1139">What did Germans urge artists to do in the Nazi German culture?</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">A: They would tell you what you could and could not do.</span> <span id="s1141">The people who did not join the didn't get any work.</span> <span id="s1142">So, they were poor.</span> <span id="s1143">The heads of the group like saw the lay of land before it happened and so they established funds to support artists that would be out of work during that time.</span> <span id="s1144">And other needy artists, I mean it was mostly artists of all types, architects, painters, writers, so anybody who needed money would get help from that group.</span> <span id="s1145">That was during the years '40, '41, '42.</span> <span id="s1146">Then in '43 it became much more serious.</span> <span id="s1147">During those years, I had prepared myself to do something different.</span> <span id="s1148">I had prepared myself to get i.d.'s as soon as they came out.</span> <span id="s1149">I.D.'s without a J on it and also i.d.'s with the J replacing them.</span> <span id="s1150">I mean I would say to Jewish people, I can make you one without a J because I had made that one for that Russian girl.</span> <span id="s1151">I was very good at falsifying things.</span> <span id="s1152">Steady hand to take the glossy part, because the picture had two layers.</span> <span id="s1153">It's a thick thing, a picture, a passport picture.</span> <span id="s1154">And the other side, this is the picture, the other side was a seal under which was the fingerprint, the fingerprint on the seal.</span> <span id="s1155">So, you had to keep the fingerprint because we didn't have the fingerprint of the one who gave his i.d. to you, so I had to take the glossy part off without injuring the back part, the seal, which I was good at.</span> <span id="s1156">And then, the picture had no stamps on it, stamps, because there were two ink stamps, one in this corner and one on that corner and I had to falsify that with two different colors of ink sometimes.</span> <span id="s1157">So, you had to have a steady hand for that.</span> <span id="s1158">That was my main occupation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">Q: When did you start to falsify i.d.'s and did you work together with someone doing this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">A: No.</span> <span id="s1161">I did it all by myself, because I had always done that before all by myself.</span> <span id="s1162">So, that was my occupation.</span> <span id="s1163">To get i.d.'s for other people, to find hiding places ahead of time and do whatever there was to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">Q: But did you work together with other people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">A: No.</span> <span id="s1166">I worked together with to dispense the printed ones that we made in the middle of those five years, because there was no printing before.</span> <span id="s1167">I did some work before that.</span> <span id="s1168">That was very tedious work.</span> <span id="s1169">It took a lot of time.</span> <span id="s1170">It was also hard to get people to give you their identity card and go to the office and ask and say I lost it or it was stolen.</span> <span id="s1171">I gave them all kinds of advice.</span> <span id="s1172">Just say it was stolen.</span> <span id="s1173">I was in the swimming pool.</span> <span id="s1174">I can't go swimming with an i.d. because I have to hang it up in the dressing room, and it's gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">Q: Can you tell us who is with whom you worked together?</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">A: Well, yes.</span> <span id="s1177">He was called "Ticky."</span> <span id="s1178">We all called him Tricky.</span> <span id="s1179">He was a gay man and very obvious, I mean, everybody knew it who knew him.</span> <span id="s1180">He was very shy and kind of an inferiority complex.</span> <span id="s1181">He didn't think he was good enough for this or that.</span> <span id="s1182">He was very retiring in his personality.</span> <span id="s1183">But, gradually I learned what was really this man's problem and we worked, as I told you, I think, as a team.</span> <span id="s1184">Because, together we did the real ones, the printed ones and went out together or had people come to my house and I would take a fingerprint and he would do something else.</span> <span id="s1185">I learned a little bit more of who he was by knowing him better.</span> <span id="s1186">Because, like I said, he was kind of a shy retiring -- and I was not a close friend of his before, but in that group we became very close.</span> <span id="s1187">One time we had a conversation about the danger that was over our head and he said, "Do you think that we will see the end of this war?"</span> <span id="s1188">And I said, "I don't think so."</span> <span id="s1189">And he said, "I don't think either."</span> <span id="s1190">He said, "Do you mind?"</span> <span id="s1191">And I said, "No, I don't."</span> <span id="s1192">He said, "I don't either."</span> <span id="s1193">So, I knew exactly that I had a partner who had the same point of view that I had.</span> <span id="s1194">I might have added that I'd rather give my life for something than give it for nothing.</span> <span id="s1195">When I get a bump on my head I die too, and I have not done anything with my life.</span> <span id="s1196">I want a high price for mine.</span> <span id="s1197">He said, "I think the same way."</span> <span id="s1198">He felt inferior about his being a gay man.</span> <span id="s1199">I have never felt that way.</span> <span id="s1200">I have never been apologetic about the way I am.</span> <span id="s1201">I always felt I'm as good as the next one, but I could never get him to feel any different because he felt that way all his life, very apologetic and not accepted.</span> <span id="s1202">I've never felt that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">Q: Did you talk a lot about his experience as a gay man and your experience as a gay woman?</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">A: No, I never even mentioned it.</span> <span id="s1205">Because it doesn't make any difference to me.</span> <span id="s1206">I have always met every human being like an equal.</span> <span id="s1207">I think a human being is a human being, however he is born is how he is born and has to live with it.</span> <span id="s1208">I have never felt any discrimination, personally, I haven't.</span> <span id="s1209">I have only experienced I think there was a discrimination for people's action afterwards, after things happened.</span> <span id="s1210">Maybe that's the reason they treated me this way or that, not very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">Q: What do you mean afterwards?</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">A: After the damage was done.</span> <span id="s1213">I mean, I have had some bad experience in California, when I came to the United States and I think I had the evidence that was some gossip about my sexuality that it was not what it ought to be as they saw it.</span> <span id="s1214">In other words, there was gossip going on, and I saw somebody getting a telephone call who was trying to find out if my contract with the Philharmonic was not extended, and I saw her go to the telephone and very surprised because they had never thought of that.</span> <span id="s1215">So, somebody must have been telling her something to change that facial expression, because she was trying to find for me.</span> <span id="s1216">Why didn't they give me a new contract and then she got the gossip and was very shocked, and I made my conclusions what she was told.</span> <span id="s1217">But that's only my perception.</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">Q: Were you careful yourself?</span> <span id="s1219">I mean, being a female conductor so early, and one of the very few female conductors, were you careful whom you told about your private life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">A: I never told anybody anything.</span> <span id="s1221">I just lived my life and I never explained anything.</span> <span id="s1222">I didn't belong to any kind of group.</span> <span id="s1223">It's not like it is here.</span> <span id="s1224">It's just well, as I told you when I found out asked me why do you do that, well I said because I love you, and I have said that to other women too.</span> <span id="s1225">And I said to my husband to insist that he wanted to get married, otherwise he would shoot himself, I said then I don't have very much choice do I?</span> <span id="s1226">And so, I told you, I don't think I can ever love a man like I can love a woman.</span> <span id="s1227">I always put the women on the pedestal, not the men.</span> <span id="s1228">I don't know why, but that's my nature.</span> <span id="s1229">Well, he said, that's right, you told me that, but I still want to live where you live.</span> <span id="s1230">And I said, "Well, if that's your choice and otherwise you're going to shoot yourself, I think you better live."</span> <span id="s1231">So, we married and we had a very good relationship, especially musically, because, he took me under his protection to get me to concentrate on my music, because I had something to offer he found, and that was his mission.</span> <span id="s1232">We made music together.</span> <span id="s1233">We played concerts together, and we were very good friends, but I was never as carried away and as romantic as I can be the other way.</span> <span id="s1234">I've had relationships with women that were always coming to me, almost without exception.</span> <span id="s1235">I have never approached women all the time.</span> <span id="s1236">It just so happened that I decide to help them or do something for them or something, or take them out of a situation that was detrimental to them or something.</span> <span id="s1237">I protect them.</span> <span id="s1238">I have always done things for people.</span> <span id="s1239">I'm not happy when I can't do that.</span> <span id="s1240">I feel very lonesome if there's nobody around that I can help and love and protect.</span> <span id="s1241">And I don't understand people that can only live for themselves.</span> <span id="s1242">I can't understand it.</span> <span id="s1243">Where do you get your happiness?</span> <span id="s1244">Where do you get your satisfaction?</span> <span id="s1245">What do you do with your life?</span> <span id="s1246">What do you do with your strengths?</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">There must be somebody who needs help.</span> <span id="s1248">There always is.</span> <span id="s1249">And I've never failed.</span> <span id="s1250">I've never been alone.</span> <span id="s1251">I've always helped people, whether they were worth it or not comes out later.</span> <span id="s1252">They haven't all been worth my effort, but the effort was worth it.</span> <span id="s1253">That's the way I look at life.</span> <span id="s1254">But I have had wonderful experiences, and I have had awful experiences, but it all balances out.</span> <span id="s1255">I mean, I have had most wonderful, very romantic -- you make your own life.</span> <span id="s1256">Nothing makes it for you.</span> <span id="s1257">You make your own life.</span> <span id="s1258">You live your own life and that's making it.</span> <span id="s1259">I mean what you hear me tell you is my life.</span> <span id="s1260">That's what I did with it.</span> <span id="s1261">And I know also what I didn't do with it, because there are a lot of things that I should have done, maybe, could have done, maybe, but it is only very short, and it gets shorter when you look at it.</span> <span id="s1262">The longer you look at it, the smaller it becomes.</span> <span id="s1263">The more you think I wish I had another 90 years, because there's so much --.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">Tape #6</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">A: The German occupation, yes, from '40, I really led a little bit of a different kind of life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">Something that was really up my alley.</span> <span id="s1267">I had never had that much contact with all the artists.</span> <span id="s1268">There was a little socio -- you know, a little group that was called, I think we called it the Kring (ph).</span> <span id="s1269">There was a cafe where you could have the magazines and go in the afternoon when you're through working, and where you found each other and take a little drink and find the newspapers and read.</span> <span id="s1270">That's a membership that was $100 and I had never really spent that much for a membership like that.</span> <span id="s1271">I always worked hard, but I was doing a little less work, and I joined that.</span> <span id="s1272">I became a member and that's the kind of life that I thought was kind of fun to live.</span> <span id="s1273">Read the magazines and meet the people there and on days there I met there I saw more often, because I really never had time to spend a lot of time with the people that I knew.</span> <span id="s1274">And I did have more time, because I was teaching less and less, and did other things.</span> <span id="s1275">These people had prepared themselves for these occupational years, and I did my way, with my i.d.'s, preparing and working.</span> <span id="s1276">So, I was asked to join that group by , that resistance group.</span> <span id="s1277">In other words, I was told what they were doing, and I was telling them what I was doing.</span> <span id="s1278">So, we all got acquainted, and I had a student who had a brother, a Jewish student, and he is one of the people I brought to the group.</span> <span id="s1279">I brought in Rudy Lumgar (ph) who was one of the people who was executed.</span> <span id="s1280">He worked as my right hand man during those dangerous years.</span> <span id="s1281">In other words, when we were preparing the destruction of the files in City Hall, Rudy was one of the workers.</span> <span id="s1282">And Rudy brought in a whole bunch of his friends, young men who were called the , who the group had rat poison, and that was the name for the newspaper that they gave out.</span> <span id="s1283">The underground newspaper was called .</span> <span id="s1284">So, I knew all of that.</span> <span id="s1285">And Rudy became my in- between man.</span> <span id="s1286">Me, Rudy, headquarters, because they didn't want women in the attack on City Hall.</span> <span id="s1287">We never got an active part.</span> <span id="s1288">I only got the part in the preparation.</span> <span id="s1289">They met once a week, first once a month, but that was not enough.</span> <span id="s1290">It became once a week, and later, we didn't meet, because it was too dangerous.</span> <span id="s1291">But, I would get news through Rudy.</span> <span id="s1292">And Rudy didn't know where I lived, and I didn't know where Rudy lived.</span> <span id="s1293">But we had always from week to week, a point on the street somewhere, where we would meet each other.</span> <span id="s1294">If one of the two would not show up at that hour at that point, then we knew, disappear.</span> <span id="s1295">That means change how you met last or change where you are known to live.</span> <span id="s1296">It all depends.</span> <span id="s1297">Some people were hiding earlier than others because they knew they were on the list.</span> <span id="s1298">So the house wasn't really sealed and some people's house was not sealed yet.</span> <span id="s1299">So, at the time, the day that I didn't see Rudy when I was supposed to see him, I didn't go home, and I didn't go -- I knew he would be found.</span> <span id="s1300">I knew something was wrong, so I better disappear.</span> <span id="s1301">And that's why I wasn't arrested, because they had my address, but they didn't get to my house early enough.</span> <span id="s1302">So, when I came back from the war, back to Holland, I found my house sealed by the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s1303">Nothing touched.</span> <span id="s1304">Nobody had ever been in there.</span> <span id="s1305">They didn't find me.</span> <span id="s1306">They sealed it, so I couldn't go back home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">Q: Was this plan developed to protect the population, why did you want to protect it?</span> <span id="s1308">How was the plan developed to attack the population register, and why did you want to destroy the</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">population register?</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">A: Well, because we were given all regular i.d.'s and the Jews had the J on it, so if you gave them a false one, you had to make a fake number on it, because all the ones were numbered and had a duplicate in City Hall.</span> <span id="s1311">So, then at one of our monthly meetings, right after we had done all that and dispensed all these false one, we were in the process of doing this all the time, because we had an unlimited number of false cards.</span> <span id="s1312">We could give any Jewish person, a false identity card, but there would not be a duplicate with the same number in City Hall.</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">So, when we realized that there would be thousands of false cards in circulation, then in the meeting we said, we have to destroy that, because when one person discovers that this card is false, they'll know that there are false cards in circulation.</span> <span id="s1314">So, that's when the plan immediately got taken up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">Q: Who had the idea?</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">A: I think I did.</span> <span id="s1317">If I remember well, I said, "This is getting too dangerous, because everybody is carrying false cards."</span> <span id="s1318">I was carrying false cards myself, and for three months I was disguised because when my living quarters were sealed and searched, they found pictures of me as a man, disguised as a man, and a friend of mine had the same figure, the same height and I had a three piece suit that fit me to a tee, except this, what I have here, had to be matched down here.</span> <span id="s1319">So, I was a little heavier set little man, and I had to buy a hat, the smallest hat that I ever found, and it still had to have a band in it to fit my little head, and I had to go to a barber shop and have a haircut that was really a man's haircut.</span> <span id="s1320">I still remember the day I went there.</span> <span id="s1321">The there was a big men's barber shop with lots of barbers cutting hair, and I had to make the effort to get it all straightened out, and I really looked pretty good.</span> <span id="s1322">I went out for the first time in my disguise and I went to get a haircut right away.</span> <span id="s1323">I bought glasses, just window glasses and I put that on and I went into the barber shop and I took my hat off and put it on the hook, and the barber walked up to me and said "What do you want sir, shape or a haircut?"</span> <span id="s1324">And I said, "No, just haircut."</span> <span id="s1325">And he didn't bat an eye.</span> <span id="s1326">He gave me a hair cut, and I got my hat.</span> <span id="s1327">I had a cold and it helped to get my voice a little down.</span> <span id="s1328">I talked like that all the time, and I got used to it pretty soon.</span> <span id="s1329">For three months I was disguised as a man and very successfully so, because I lived on number 64 and my mother lived at 44, and I passed my mother several times, during that time, and she never recognized me.</span> <span id="s1330">I also didn't take my hat off for her, but she wouldn't have recognized me anyway, because nobody did.</span> <span id="s1331">I bounced even into somebody because I was standing at the exit of the railway station at , and I bounced into my husband's second wife, who I went to school with, and she did not recognize me.</span> <span id="s1332">I really was -- I was a very naturally looking young guy.</span> <span id="s1333">The only thing is there is an advantage to disguise as a man when you're a woman because you look ten years younger.</span> <span id="s1334">Everybody thought I was pretty young looking.</span> <span id="s1335">He asked me "Shave?"</span> <span id="s1336">and this was really to laugh about, but I didn't laugh, because I was too tense.</span> <span id="s1337">That was my first outing to get my hair cut.</span> <span id="s1338">I lived for three months with two of my students.</span> <span id="s1339">Two girls, one was a writer and .</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">Q: When did this happen?</span> <span id="s1341">When did you disguise yourself as a man?</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">A: It was right after the other people were arrested, and I couldn't go home anyway, because I didn't have a home.</span> <span id="s1343">I disguised as a man, and I lived with them and tried to continue to do what I did before and that is distribute more identity cards and travel.</span> <span id="s1344">I traveled back to them all the time.</span> <span id="s1345">And they gave me shelter all the time.</span> <span id="s1346">Then, of course, after it became obvious that I was bringing everybody my danger by being there and the raids were worse, the nights that they took a block and circled it to find people and counted the beds that had been unmade.</span> <span id="s1347">I mean it got very difficult.</span> <span id="s1348">That was the end of '43.</span> <span id="s1349">I felt that I am jeopardizing everyone wherever I go, as a man or as a woman, it doesn't make any difference.</span> <span id="s1350">They took people off the street to go to working camps.</span> <span id="s1351">So, that was the year that was the most eventful.</span> <span id="s1352">Every day was eventful.</span> <span id="s1353">I distributed things with the train disguised as a man.</span> <span id="s1354">I made myself the name Hans on my i.d. I came in there, in a hotel and found that it was completely filled with the occupational army, and I nursed that cold that I had and I had my voice low and it was dinner time that I arrived in I had to distribute food coupons and money.</span> <span id="s1355">I sit down and haven't inscribed my entry in the hotel, and so the waiter comes up to me and says, "Sir, I have to have your i.d. I'll do it for you.</span> <span id="s1356">Give me your i.d. I'll put your name in the book."</span> <span id="s1357">And I give him, and I'm sweating because he doesn't come very fast back to me.</span> <span id="s1358">And I eat my soup and I get really nervous.</span> <span id="s1359">And he came back and he had me in the hotel, and I relaxed.</span> <span id="s1360">But I mean, I've had moments that I got a little nervous, but most of the time I didn't.</span> <span id="s1361">We ran out of money.</span> <span id="s1362">See, all the time that I was still working in Holland, I had contact with because he was not gone.</span> <span id="s1363">One time he asked me, he said we are very short of money.</span> <span id="s1364">Do you have any source that you can help us with money.</span> <span id="s1365">And I said, "Well, I have some people that I know that are very wealthy," and one was Mr. Heinka (ph.) My mother was a good friend of Mrs. Heinka, and I didn't know him well, but I knew he was a music lover, and I had an instinctive feeling that he was on the right side.</span> <span id="s1366">But, you know, you have to go by what you feel.</span> <span id="s1367">I didn't know him.</span> <span id="s1368">I knew her.</span> <span id="s1369">I had brought the kids some Christmas presents disguised as Santa Claus, and we have that in Holland, December 5.</span> <span id="s1370">Anyway, I went to see Mr. Heinka and asked him if he could help us financially.</span> <span id="s1371">And he said, "How come you trust me?"</span> <span id="s1372">I said, "Well, I go by faces.</span> <span id="s1373">That's all I have to go by.</span> <span id="s1374">I don't know."</span> <span id="s1375">He meant how do you know I'm on your side, because he was not in our group.</span> <span id="s1376">He was just an acquaintance and had all the money he wanted.</span> <span id="s1377">He said you're right.</span> <span id="s1378">He said, "But you know I have a problem, because I have my office riddled with Germans looking over my shoulder, breathing down my neck, want to know where everything, where the money comes from that is spent," he said, "I'm not my own boss anymore."</span> <span id="s1379">He said it's very difficult to do, unless he said, "Do you have an idea?"</span> <span id="s1380">I said, "Maybe I do."</span> <span id="s1381">He said, "You do?"</span> <span id="s1382">I said, "Yes, I have an idea, buy my cello.</span> <span id="s1383">They're pretty costly and I have no way to use it.</span> <span id="s1384">I can't play now.</span> <span id="s1385">They would find me immediately.</span> <span id="s1386">Who's playing cello.</span> <span id="s1387">I have no time."</span> <span id="s1388">He said, "That's a wonderful idea."</span> <span id="s1389">And he did.</span> <span id="s1390">So, I brought my cello, and he gave me the money that they asked for.</span> <span id="s1391">And of course, after the war, I got my cello back.</span> <span id="s1392">There was no problem there.</span> <span id="s1393">It was not long before I left because I felt -- and then one of the two girls that I stayed -- see this was the time that we had to do everything in such a hurry.</span> <span id="s1394">That night, we had to print food cards, I mean our group did.</span> <span id="s1395">I didn't do all of them, but I knew what was done.</span> <span id="s1396">I stayed one night in one of the attic apartments, where they had hid because I knew they could not look again.</span> <span id="s1397">They had been there before.</span> <span id="s1398">There were bullet holes in the walls.</span> <span id="s1399">I mean I stayed anywhere where I could stay without jeopardizing people if I could.</span> <span id="s1400">But it became harder and harder and harder, and so I thought I have to get out of here because the day is not far that I am found.</span> <span id="s1401">And I worked also for the group 2,000 which was headed by a friend of my sister's.</span> <span id="s1402">Her name was Coby and was a high one in the Masons.</span> <span id="s1403">He, the father and his son -- well, I forgot his name now, but he was killed by the Germans, because they had it very much in for the Masons, too.</span> <span id="s1404">And Coby I have made many false i.d.s for before we got them printed.</span> <span id="s1405">I think she died at the time.</span> <span id="s1406">Anyway, I stayed in different places and more and more had the feeling that I have to get out before I jeopardize other people that give me shelter.</span> <span id="s1407">And that's when I decided to leave the girls, and then one of the two, the writer, said she wanted to go with me.</span> <span id="s1408">She used to live in Northern France and she wanted to go back there.</span> <span id="s1409">She had a friend there.</span> <span id="s1410">I said that's fine with me if she just follow me, be with me.</span> <span id="s1411">And so, but I had a pinched hernia at the time, because we had an iron bed that was camouflaging the trap door where I was supposed to disappear if there was to be a raid, and the house would be searched.</span> <span id="s1412">And that iron bed was terribly heavy.</span> <span id="s1413">I must have torn something and got the hernia and had to be operated.</span> <span id="s1414">I didn't dare travel with it.</span> <span id="s1415">We had to find a doctor who we could trust, because I was going to be operated on in the hospital under a false name, and I must disguise myself back from man to woman and gave myself another name and another i.d. and I was Louisa Fermana (ph), and I went to the Nun Hospital, and there was a doctor recommended to me who was on right side.</span> <span id="s1416">I had an operation early December and the Mother Superior, she asked me for my food ration cards, and I said I don't have them.</span> <span id="s1417">And she said, "Just write your family to send them."</span> <span id="s1418">I said, "I don't have them, I don't have a family."</span> <span id="s1419">And she do like this and she said, "Oh, I understand."</span> <span id="s1420">Now, if somebody else asked you to say I have written home to send them, and by the time the answer comes it will be all right.</span> <span id="s1421">She knew I had no ration cards.</span> <span id="s1422">And so I got my hernia operation and I don't know how many days after that, but it couldn't be more than ten days after that, I got the sign that I could leave the country.</span> <span id="s1423">And I had to follow two men that would come out of the train in , at a certain day, but don't go with them, and don't show that you know them, but you'll see two men and they'll go to a house.</span> <span id="s1424">That's how my trip started to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1425">And I walked all over the borders because every border, Holland, Belgium, especially Belgium France was five miles forbidden zone.</span> <span id="s1426">So, it had to be done on foot through the woods.</span> <span id="s1427">I left at the end of December and I arrived in Switzerland February 12, snow this high.</span> <span id="s1428">I walked about 12 hours in the snow and I avoided the men who was the messenger between our gate and Belgium France.</span> <span id="s1429">In other words, he was the messenger who did this all the time, contact people when they are on their way or stuck or something.</span> <span id="s1430">He brought me money a couple of times.</span> <span id="s1431">His name was Tony, and he asked me whether he could go with me.</span> <span id="s1432">He was Jewish, and he was also very Jewish looking.</span> <span id="s1433">And he said, "But you know, I'm so Jewish looking I'm conscious of that and I don't want to jeopardize you."</span> <span id="s1434">I said, "Tony, by the time they see us, it doesn't matter whether you look Jewish or not."</span> <span id="s1435">I said, "We've had it.</span> <span id="s1436">Sure, you can go with me."</span> <span id="s1437">But that was from Paris to Switzerland he asked me that.</span> <span id="s1438">I mean, I didn't travel with him until the trip from Paris to Switzerland, but it took that long.</span> <span id="s1439">See, the trip was interesting in a different way because we walked for 12 hours without stopping.</span> <span id="s1440">He wanted to stop all the time.</span> <span id="s1441">He said "I'm exhausted."</span> <span id="s1442">I said, "There's no stopping in the snow.</span> <span id="s1443">We have to walk until we stop somewhere in Switzerland."</span> <span id="s1444">And we did.</span> <span id="s1445">We never stopped from 9:00 in the morning until 10:00 at night.</span> <span id="s1446">And then we got to jail in Switzerland, which is another story.</span> <span id="s1447">But that's the trip we took and that's the work I did.</span> <span id="s1448">So, I don't know what I could probably tell you more about those years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">Q: Can you give us an idea about the take on the population register.</span> <span id="s1450">You started to tell that you came up with the idea --?</span></p> <p><span id="s1451">A: I said we have to destroy it.</span> <span id="s1452">And then they started to all agree.</span> <span id="s1453">We have to and we have to do it now.</span> <span id="s1454">I said we have to start immediately because that takes a lot of preparation.</span> <span id="s1455">You can't expect to do that in a jiffy.</span> <span id="s1456">I mean, I knew it was guarded.</span> <span id="s1457">We all knew that.</span> <span id="s1458">I mean, they were expecting all kinds of things from the Dutch, from the Resistance.</span> <span id="s1459">So, they had two policeman outside.</span> <span id="s1460">They had one night watchman.</span> <span id="s1461">They had one motorcycle coming around the block to see whether the policemen were still doing their duty.</span> <span id="s1462">They had an arrangement with the night watchman that he would be available for telephone calls checking up.</span> <span id="s1463">In other words, we had to find out how this office was protected.</span> <span id="s1464">And we found out more and more that it was terribly protected, terribly much protected.</span> <span id="s1465">So, everything had to be counteracted with another thing.</span> <span id="s1466">So they made two police uniforms.</span> <span id="s1467">They had to find out whether all the captains were known to the policemen, yes or no.</span> <span id="s1468">They had to find out what happened inside.</span> <span id="s1469">How were things guarded, protected.</span> <span id="s1470">And certain things they found out almost everything, but one or two things they didn't find out.</span> <span id="s1471">One was that they didn't find out that the Germans called in every so often at night to see whether the watchmen were still there and whether everything was okay.</span> <span id="s1472">And so, when they finally had it all prepared, they knew how to cope with all the few things that went a little bit different from what they expected.</span> <span id="s1473">But they had expected to have everything prepared enough, and they did successfully blow the thing up.</span> <span id="s1474">I remember I was on the roof.</span> <span id="s1475">It was going to be done at night, as soon as it was dark.</span> <span id="s1476">I think it was on a Saturday, and I was on the roof to see whether I could hear something, because they didn't want any women there at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">Tape #7</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">Q: You said it's becoming too dangerous.</span> <span id="s1479">We should plan something to do against the files in the population register.</span> <span id="s1480">And that happened.</span> <span id="s1481">But you also said but women were not welcome or excluded, why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">A: I think because the main attackers were policemen.</span> <span id="s1483">And to be disguised as a policeman for a man is easier than for a woman, less chance.</span> <span id="s1484">Also, because it was physically a pretty hard job.</span> <span id="s1485">So, I think they had a very good reason.</span> <span id="s1486">However, women could have brought in some of the explosions, some of the things that were not too heavy to carry.</span> <span id="s1487">They principally said no women.</span> <span id="s1488">There was no question about that.</span> <span id="s1489">And I think that the superiority of the men that is not quite dealt with in this world.</span> <span id="s1490">I think eventually it will be, because I think they are doing a good job by having possibilities for women to have men's jobs.</span> <span id="s1491">And not saying this is just appropriate for men because women don't do a good job.</span> <span id="s1492">There is no such thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">There are some women that do a better job than some other man that might be very masculine, strong muscles and everything else.</span> <span id="s1494">But you can find a woman very easily that's superior to him.</span> <span id="s1495">Not every man is better than every woman.</span> <span id="s1496">But they think so, some of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">Q: But was there any discussion?</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">A: No.</span> <span id="s1499">I don't think so.</span> <span id="s1500">The women have played a part.</span> <span id="s1501">And there are some women who also were caught because they had been working at the plan.</span> <span id="s1502">But none of the women were asked to do anything that night that they had the attack take place.</span> <span id="s1503">That was a man's job.</span> <span id="s1504">And so, I think the women didn't expect.</span> <span id="s1505">I would have liked to be part of it, but --.</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">Q: How was the attack then prepared?</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">A: The attack was prepared that we had to for one thing, we had to find how to get a leak in the personnel who could tell us exactly where the cards or tickets were held and how the procedure was inside of that part of the building.</span> <span id="s1508">And we did get that.</span> <span id="s1509">We found that out.</span> <span id="s1510">We had to have a tailor that could make two policemen uniforms.</span> <span id="s1511">We had to find some leak in the police force that would tell us whether the officers were known by all the policemen, yes or no, and so forth.</span> <span id="s1512">We had a lot of preparation to do.</span> <span id="s1513">It went on for months.</span> <span id="s1514">But the first things that had to be done first to find the material that policemen uniforms are made of an to get certain parts of the uniform of the police people and that's one of the reasons that that traitors got in because one asked the other and another asked another and pretty soon it was that was asked for some police helmets and he realized what the helmets were needed for and he could make $10,000 to give information.</span> <span id="s1515">So they held it up.</span> <span id="s1516">It was too many people involved in other words.</span> <span id="s1517">There were so many people involved that it became very dangerous.</span> <span id="s1518">And that's what happened.</span> <span id="s1519">See, we couldn't be so selective because we needed so many special things that nobody could provide without asking maybe an acquaintance.</span> <span id="s1520">I mean the tailor was caught.</span> <span id="s1521">The professor -- I know the tailor was caught and so forth.</span> <span id="s1522">That's where the danger is.</span> <span id="s1523">When you get so many people involved and then you get stuck and you have to ask some outsider, did you have any way?</span> <span id="s1524">And they think so and that one is fine and that one is fine, but the next one is not.</span> <span id="s1525">That's very simple.</span> <span id="s1526">They had too many people that knew it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1527">Q: Was the attack successful?</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">A: Very successful.</span> <span id="s1529">And of course, everything went according to schedule, except a few details which is interesting from a purely rubber policeman standpoint.</span> <span id="s1530">The difficulties that showed up were of minor importance.</span> <span id="s1531">It went off without any problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">Q: Who was leading the attack?</span> <span id="s1533">Who was the leader of the attack?</span></p> <p><span id="s1534">A: The leader of the attack actually was .</span> <span id="s1535">The next man to him was , who was not caught, but who died later.</span> <span id="s1536">He got shot in the back.</span> <span id="s1537">He was more of a -- he was not a quiet man.</span> <span id="s1538">He was more of a show off.</span> <span id="s1539">I'll show you what I can do.</span> <span id="s1540">He wanted it known, whereas was very quiet about what he did, very modest about what he did.</span> <span id="s1541">But he got his satisfaction, to show what a gay man could do.</span> <span id="s1542">And certainly wasn't any less than a strong man with a real masculine nature would do.</span> <span id="s1543">Lots of those wouldn't do any of that.</span> <span id="s1544">That's what he had to have felt like, I'm sure.</span> <span id="s1545">Because he felt good already during the time that we worked together.</span> <span id="s1546">He didn't feel like he used to feel according to his own writing and his own speaking.</span> <span id="s1547">He would have never said "No, I don't mind giving my life for it."</span> <span id="s1548">when he talked about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">Q: Did other members of the group know that was gay and you were lesbian?</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s1551">We had a meeting and we were just having a coffee break, and I don't know what brought it on, but we were talking about handwriting and that you could tell from handwriting whether a person was a woman or a man.</span> <span id="s1552">I was curious and I think said that he could tell.</span> <span id="s1553">So, we all decided to write something down, something that you couldn't tell whether a woman wrote it or a man, and passed these slips of paper, mix them and then would look at them and tell.</span> <span id="s1554">And when he came to my handwriting, he said that's a woman.</span> <span id="s1555">I said, "That's mine."</span> <span id="s1556">He said, "I'm sorry, Frieda."</span> <span id="s1557">It's kind of funny, because I thought that he would say, that's a man.</span> <span id="s1558">Because I was strong enough to think my handwriting might be a problem, mix him up.</span> <span id="s1559">That was funny.</span> <span id="s1560">I never forgot that.</span> <span id="s1561">Yes, we did a lot of preparation during several months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">Q: Did you talk with or did other people talk about him as being a gay man, openly gay or about you as being lesbian?</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">A: No, I never talk about such things.</span> <span id="s1564">I have never been curious about how people feel about what I am or who I am.</span> <span id="s1565">I never felt necessity to make an announcement.</span> <span id="s1566">I remember myself being startled when people would throw it at you when you don't ask.</span> <span id="s1567">I mean, for God's sake, life is not all open.</span> <span id="s1568">I remember meeting one time a agent, and she give you a hand and at the same time say her name in a very agressive way like "I'm a lesbian" and I thought, who asks?</span> <span id="s1569">Who cares?</span> <span id="s1570">That was my thought.</span> <span id="s1571">I would never do that.</span> <span id="s1572">I had a cousin of who was a lesbian.</span> <span id="s1573">And she gave me a handshake like that and said, "Hollander."</span> <span id="s1574">That was her name.</span> <span id="s1575">Her name was Maize Hollander.</span> <span id="s1576">For God's sake, who cares.</span> <span id="s1577">You know what I mean?</span> <span id="s1578">It's not always in front of my mind what I am and how I am and how I react to things.</span> <span id="s1579">So, I think it's throwing something out that nobody asked you for.</span> <span id="s1580">And I have never felt a danger.</span> <span id="s1581">I never felt a reason to be curious in people.</span> <span id="s1582">I never had anybody ask me.</span> <span id="s1583">I would have been surprised.</span> <span id="s1584">I would have said, "Why do you ask?"</span> <span id="s1585">which I usually say when people ask a question that I don't want to answer.</span> <span id="s1586">Then I say, "Well, why do you ask?</span> <span id="s1587">Why this interest?"</span> <span id="s1588">You know Bobby did it one time very nicely, she had a meeting at her home and she had a lot of gay people there.</span> <span id="s1589">And one of my students who is not gay at all, is very normal man in his whole lifestyle and had been married and had children, for some odd reason when he came in, he kind of sidled up to her and said "Aren't there an awful lot of gay men here?"</span> <span id="s1590">And she said, "If you're interested, let me know, I'll introduce you," which I thought was very astute.</span> <span id="s1591">Because she wanted to indicate that she didn't care what people are, how many there are.</span> <span id="s1592">I mean, she's far beyond that.</span> <span id="s1593">And so, he was feeling ashamed I guess, because he didn't know what to say.</span> <span id="s1594">So, he kind of took off to another corner.</span> <span id="s1595">I think that's a very nice thing to say.</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">Q: But for it was important that he be recognized as a gay man within--?</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">A: No, what I really think was the trouble with him was that he was too conscious about what the part of the population was thinking knowing that he was gay.</span> <span id="s1598">And I have never been concerned about what people think of me.</span> <span id="s1599">I mean the moment you start to be concerned about what people think of you, you sink.</span> <span id="s1600">Because there are lots of people that think the wrong thing about you, no matter what, in what direction, on what subject, on what character type.</span> <span id="s1601">I mean they'll be people who like you and people who don't like you.</span> <span id="s1602">If you don't care, you don't care.</span> <span id="s1603">So, if people think that I'm no good because I'm lesbian, or they think that is no good because he's gay, why should he care?</span> <span id="s1604">I've never found trouble finding people who like me.</span> <span id="s1605">And the other people, I don't want.</span> <span id="s1606">You can't have the whole world like you.</span> <span id="s1607">And that's why I always say my opinion is as good as the next guy's, the next person.</span> <span id="s1608">You don't have to be right for everybody or liked by everybody.</span> <span id="s1609">You have your hands full if you're liked by a lot of people.</span> <span id="s1610">You have too many friends already.</span> <span id="s1611">Who knows?</span> <span id="s1612">But he was thinking along the wrong lines and met the wrong people.</span> <span id="s1613">He was born with an inferiority that because he was different, and I don't think that it has to do with whether you are lesbian or gay or this or that.</span> <span id="s1614">There are people who don't like to be considered something, different, too high, too low, too fat, too thin.</span> <span id="s1615">If you care what everybody thinks, you should be above that.</span> <span id="s1616">That's the way I am.</span> <span id="s1617">That's the way I am put in this world.</span> <span id="s1618">I didn't make myself.</span> <span id="s1619">Work with what you have.</span> <span id="s1620">Try to get what you can get.</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">Try to do to yourself what you can improve.</span> <span id="s1622">Don't cry over spilled milk.</span> <span id="s1623">This is the way I am made, I can't change it.</span> <span id="s1624">I can lie about it to protect others, not to protect myself.</span> <span id="s1625">I wouldn't do that.</span> <span id="s1626">But to protect others, I would lie about, yes, because I have no right to give their stand in life as mine were, give their weakness or if you want to call it that, or their different nature a way to other people, no.</span> <span id="s1627">That's why I would never do things like this 60 or 70 years ago.</span> <span id="s1628">I would protect -- if there was something to protect, I would feel it was my duty to protect.</span> <span id="s1629">Any questions?</span></p> <p><span id="s1630">Q: What happened after the attack of the population register?</span></p> <p><span id="s1631">A: It got destroyed.</span> <span id="s1632">It was very much of a loss for the German Occupation, very much.</span> <span id="s1633">They were very upset about it and that's why they were determined to kill those people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">Q: Were the group betrayed or how were people caught from the group?</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">A: Well, was picked up as number one.</span> <span id="s1636">He was very protective in a sense by who lived in the same house where I later lived after the war.</span> <span id="s1637">He also was inspected by the Germans and so was he.</span> <span id="s1638">Because they were very impressed with his attitude.</span> <span id="s1639">His attitude was absolutely heroic.</span> <span id="s1640">When he was arrested, they came in and said, "In the name of Hitler, we arrest you followers" or something and he said "In the name of the Queen of Holland, I'll follow you."</span> <span id="s1641">I mean he was not even startled and he was a support for all other people that were arrested.</span> <span id="s1642">He was a moral support.</span> <span id="s1643">He was absolutely what he planned to be.</span> <span id="s1644">This was it.</span> <span id="s1645">He did what he said to me he would do.</span> <span id="s1646">He was very satisfied with that solution, that he would give his life for that.</span> <span id="s1647">He would prove that you didn't have to be a heterosexual person to be heroic or to make an offer of your life.</span> <span id="s1648">He wanted to prove that point, and he was satisfied for himself that he had the opportunity to prove that.</span> <span id="s1649">And he had the strength to be a moral support for all of the others.</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">Q: How many people were arrested from the group?</span> <span id="s1651">A: Twelve.</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">Q: What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">A: There were more people arrested, but the women were not killed.</span> <span id="s1654">I think they got some jail.</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">wife gave some part of time like in jail or something to save his and he got away the same time that I did.</span> <span id="s1656">But there were very few people who were really in on the whole thing, the preparation that were not caught.</span> <span id="s1657">There was a big list.</span> <span id="s1658">Have you seen the list, because I have it here.</span> <span id="s1659">The German Military Judgment, have you seen it?</span> <span id="s1660">Well, I have it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1661">Q: What happened to these people who were arrested?</span> <span id="s1662">A: That were not killed, you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1663">Q: No, no.</span> <span id="s1664">Were they killed immediately?</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1666">They were kept in jail until the execution, which was later.</span> <span id="s1667">It wasn't very much later, but I think I have the dates somewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">Q: Was there a trial?</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">A: A military trial, yes, because the whole story is written down in German.</span> <span id="s1670">I have the whole story in German written by , and it's all what was done.</span> <span id="s1671">They described the whole thing.</span> <span id="s1672">How these people, how the uniforms were taken and they disguised themselves as policeman.</span> <span id="s1673">It's all in German and I'll show it to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1674">Q: How did you learn to know that was arrested?</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">A: Because I had arrangement with Rudy, who was my right hand man, that if he was not able to because he was caught.</span> <span id="s1676">So, I knew first that Rudy was caught.</span> <span id="s1677">I didn't first know that was caught.</span> <span id="s1678">I found that out by finding out that others were caught a couple of days later.</span> <span id="s1679">But when Rudy didn't show up, who was my personal right hand man, and brought into the group by me, I knew something bad has happened, and in a few days I found out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1680">Q: And then you went into men's clothing to hide yourself better?</span></p> <p><span id="s1681">A: I think so because I knew they had been to my house and had -- because I knew my house, I couldn't live there anymore.</span> <span id="s1682">So, I knew that I had to do something about it.</span> <span id="s1683">Because they had taken pictures of my house.</span> <span id="s1684">No, I had been a man before.</span> <span id="s1685">I had been a man before, that was already before that I had been a man and they had pictures of me.</span> <span id="s1686">So, that's why I had to disguise like a man.</span> <span id="s1687">But I don't have any pictures anymore so I don't know what happened to them.</span> <span id="s1688">When I had to leave, that was when every single time I had been somewhere, the people would tell me that the Gestapo, some people told me that the Gestapo came and asked, was I there and they said no.</span> <span id="s1689">And they said she must have been here and they would say I haven't seen her for months, lying of difficult it was.</span> <span id="s1690">But they would come a couple days after I had been there.</span> <span id="s1691">So, they were on my trail and I felt that I was jeopardizing too many people that gave me shelter and I didn't know where to go.</span> <span id="s1692">I knew I would be caught pretty soon.</span> <span id="s1693">So, I knew that I wouldn't be of any help to anybody and maybe be the cause of somebody being killed along with me.</span> <span id="s1694">So, I decided I had to leave, and that's when I decided I was going to go and I let them know I was.</span> <span id="s1695">And then I took the operation and rested up from that in , because I didn't work either when I was in the hospital.</span> <span id="s1696">And right after, I went and I said, I'm leaving.</span> <span id="s1697">And the doctor that operated, the surgeon that operated on me said, "Where are you going?"</span> <span id="s1698">And I said "I'm supposed to go to England.</span> <span id="s1699">I'm supposed to be picked up in Northern France by a plane" and then I found out later that the Germans had intercepted our code and so I could not get word about whether that plane would land in Northern France to pick me up.</span> <span id="s1700">And so, I didn't get a plane, so I was stuck in Paris and I had to find my own way.</span> <span id="s1701">I sat in Paris for the longest time and Tony came back and forth from Holland, Brussels, Paris, and I had to find my own way because he did not know a way either.</span> <span id="s1702">I mean, in other words, they run out of a way to get to Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1703">Because the one that I had used in the past had been found out.</span> <span id="s1704">So, I sat in Paris for the longest time.</span> <span id="s1705">And I had a friend in Paris and she picked up the phone one day and she said in the phone to me "I know of way to get" and I said, "Hang up the phone, I'll be right over."</span> <span id="s1706">Because that always dangerous, anything you said on the phone could be overheard.</span> <span id="s1707">So, I went to see her and she said I know a couple that has found a way to get to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1708">I have just heard it from a friend and this is the name.</span> <span id="s1709">I forgot, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1710">It is a young couple, they have found a way, but you have to go through a river.</span> <span id="s1711">You have to wade through the river, which makes the border between France and Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1712">And I said, "I'll go, get me the address."</span> <span id="s1713">And she did.</span> <span id="s1714">That was in and they were very young people.</span> <span id="s1715">She was a very innocent looking sweet blond woman and her husband.</span> <span id="s1716">They must have been in their early twenties.</span> <span id="s1717">And I still remember it as I sit there now, she was peeling an egg, a hard boiled egg for breakfast and the egg was over boiled and was green, the yolk was green and she had never seen that.</span> <span id="s1718">She said, "Oh" and she dropped the egg and she said, "I can't eat this.</span> <span id="s1719">Look at the color of this egg."</span> <span id="s1720">And I laughed because it was so funny because you can eat it fine.</span> <span id="s1721">It just doesn't look very good and I said have you never seen a green egg?</span> <span id="s1722">And I looked at her eyes and I thought this woman is all right.</span> <span id="s1723">She is just an innocent young girl, but she is never going to be a traitor.</span> <span id="s1724">I could tell right away how her eyes looked.</span> <span id="s1725">So then they proceeded they had found out a way that you could get, that it was pretty hard because it was winter.</span> <span id="s1726">It was February.</span> <span id="s1727">We had to walk five miles out of the border.</span> <span id="s1728">You had to walk five miles and then you had to walk all the way north until you get to the place where the bridge was from Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1729">And the river, the bridge and then you're in France, well, because the bridge was blown up.</span> <span id="s1730">So, it was only a blown up bridge, and there was a place, a farmers family lived out in nowhere.</span> <span id="s1731">So, I went with Tony there and we got off the train and we started to walk and we found the farm.</span> <span id="s1732">And there was snow this high.</span> <span id="s1733">And there was nobody out.</span> <span id="s1734">It was a blizzard.</span> <span id="s1735">And we had to really walk.</span> <span id="s1736">All I remember I had with me was my music satchel with one towel because I know I had to wade through the river and so I took a towel with me.</span> <span id="s1737">That was all, and what we had on.</span> <span id="s1738">I don't know why I had nothing else, but I didn't have anything else, and a silver cigarette case that I had inherited from my half brother, which was heavy silver, which I had gotten from my mother.</span> <span id="s1739">And my shoes had just a heel, what you call oxford or something, you know, just walking shoes, not even heavy snow shoes, nothing.</span> <span id="s1740">That's what I had.</span> <span id="s1741">That's what we all had left in Paris and I took that.</span> <span id="s1742">And we got to the farm, and there was a husband and wife and they said we'll give you breakfast.</span> <span id="s1743">It was maybe 9:00.</span> <span id="s1744">And she said, give me your shoes because they are wet and your socks and I'll dry them in the oven while you eat your breakfast.</span> <span id="s1745">And then the farmer looked at me and said in French, you'll never get there.</span> <span id="s1746">It's too hard.</span> <span id="s1747">I thought, well, I can give it a chance and we ate our breakfast and I got my shoes back from the oven.</span> <span id="s1748">He said there's a young man coming on skis and he's going to --.</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">Tape #8</span></p> <p><span id="s1750">A: The river was not visible from the farm.</span> <span id="s1751">We finished our breakfast.</span> <span id="s1752">I got my warm shoes out of the oven and put them on.</span> <span id="s1753">We decided that we were going to leave, and I told you that the farmer said you're not going to leave Germany.</span> <span id="s1754">That means you will never arrive in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1755">And I said, "Well, I'll take a chance."</span> <span id="s1756">And anyway, we got to walking and out comes a young man on skis from the , he said he was from the Marquee which is the French Resistance, so the farmer said he will guide you and tell you where is the best way to cross the river because it gets shallow at some point, and he knows, so follow him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1757">That's how, we thanked the farmer and his wife and we went behind the ski and after maybe a half a mile, he told us where to cross and he went back.</span> <span id="s1758">What we had to do is we had to take our clothes off completely and bundle them up and hold them on our heads.</span> <span id="s1759">I said to Tony, now Tony, you're much taller than I am, so if the water comes to here with you, it comes to here with me.</span> <span id="s1760">But if comes to here with you, I'm under, so go slowly so that I can watch it because I don't swim and so I would be under the water and that would be the end of me.</span> <span id="s1761">I thought it was kind of fun and he kind of smiled and said he'd take it easy.</span> <span id="s1762">He said he kept his shorts on and I looked at him and I said, "I don't keep anything on."</span> <span id="s1763">He said, "Well, it just my old fashioned nature."</span> <span id="s1764">And I said, "Well, you're wrong because when I am across I brought a towel and I can dry myself off, but I have nothing wet to put on.</span> <span id="s1765">You'll have to put those shorts back on and they will be wet."</span> <span id="s1766">Well, he thought it was nice that he could keep his shorts on and he walked in front of me and we got across.</span> <span id="s1767">It was so cold.</span> <span id="s1768">It was ice cold.</span> <span id="s1769">And of course, when it's ice cold and wet, you don't get yourself dry whether you have a towel or not.</span> <span id="s1770">It's just impossible.</span> <span id="s1771">So, we were there for the longest time.</span> <span id="s1772">I think we must have been at least 15 minutes to 20 minutes to get something on even though I had a little towel, but we did get it on, and we got our shirts back on and we were on the other side.</span> <span id="s1773">We were actually in Switzerland when we crossed the river, because that was the natural border.</span> <span id="s1774">But we didn't have much profit from that, because on the Swiss side, there was an absolutely steep mountain, so we couldn't get into Switzerland and hide.</span> <span id="s1775">The forest was completely filled with snow and trees and no way of climbing.</span> <span id="s1776">So, we had to walk along the river in full sight of anybody.</span> <span id="s1777">I mean, if there would have been border guards from the Swiss side looking for us, they would have seen us.</span> <span id="s1778">If there would have been people from the French side, we haven't met anybody that whole day.</span> <span id="s1779">It was absolute silence.</span> <span id="s1780">It was gorgeous.</span> <span id="s1781">It is a trip I will never forget.</span> <span id="s1782">It was the most wonderful quiet trip of ten or twelve hours that we walked, because we arrived finally to the bridge around dark, 8:00, 9:00, and then we had to walk up the road.</span> <span id="s1783">See, the road would go down to the bridge and that would be the river, the border, but the bridge was gone.</span> <span id="s1784">So we walked there.</span> <span id="s1785">So you could only walk in the water or you walk up the road but there was no road after.</span> <span id="s1786">And so we had to walk up the road and we must have looked like lost tramps or something.</span> <span id="s1787">Pretty soon we came by houses so we knew that people were seeing us.</span> <span id="s1788">And finally, we came to a little cafe and I stopped there and I said let's try to make a phone call.</span> <span id="s1789">And I got in there with him with Tony and I did have no money, nothing.</span> <span id="s1790">No Swiss money, no french money.</span> <span id="s1791">I don't know if Tony had any but anyway, I know I didn't have any.</span> <span id="s1792">I only had the silver cigarette case from my half brother.</span> <span id="s1793">The first we talked to was the innkeeper and he said the phone is upstairs.</span> <span id="s1794">And I go upstairs and sure enough there is a phone on the wall and I try to call the Dutch consulate and the telephone lady gives me somebody else an she said I will try for you what I can get somebody.</span> <span id="s1795">I said to the innkeeper, keep this cigarette case for me until I pay you because I have no Swiss money.</span> <span id="s1796">He knew right away we were refugees.</span> <span id="s1797">They had called that there were refugees coming up the hill.</span> <span id="s1798">Pretty soon the border police came on skis and he took the phone out of my hand while I was waiting for the telephone girl to get me somebody from the consulate.</span> <span id="s1799">By that time it was 8:00 or 9:00 and of course there was nobody there, and this guard that came in, took the telephone from me and said, "You have no right to telephone here."</span> <span id="s1800">He was very unfriendly.</span> <span id="s1801">So, I didn't have anybody to talk to.</span> <span id="s1802">Then we went downstairs, and his wife and daughter of the border guard came in and said to him, don't you see these people are exhausted.</span> <span id="s1803">Don't you want to offer them something to drink.</span> <span id="s1804">And he did.</span> <span id="s1805">He followed what his wife said, and he ordered a carafe of wine.</span> <span id="s1806">And of course you can imagine after the whole day walking in this high snow what you feel when you drink some wine.</span> <span id="s1807">I felt like I couldn't get up off the seat.</span> <span id="s1808">But pretty soon I did and he said we have to take you to jail.</span> <span id="s1809">I said, where is jail.</span> <span id="s1810">And he said it's quite a ways from here and I see you don't have any skis.</span> <span id="s1811">We go on our skis but you will have to walk.</span> <span id="s1812">We will take it easy, buy you will have to walk to jail.</span> <span id="s1813">Well, I don't know how we did it, but we did.</span> <span id="s1814">We walked to jail and we got each our own cell, Tony and I. I never saw Tony any more.</span> <span id="s1815">I had to stay in that cell about two and a half days.</span> <span id="s1816">A policeman came and took pictures and asked whether I had any way that I could prove that I was a Dutch subject, because I told him that I was Dutch and I've been in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1817">And I said "yes, I can prove that.</span> <span id="s1818">I've studied here with a man by the name of " And he and I was had a room with the mayor of who so happened and he said it was enough and he took a picture and he left another night in the cell and then he came back and said it's verified.</span> <span id="s1819">The references that you gave are verified.</span> <span id="s1820">And he said something like it's none of your business.</span> <span id="s1821">And they had to send Tony back in the snow.</span> <span id="s1822">And I knew that I could have saved his life, but I didn't know it then.</span> <span id="s1823">They asked me were we a couple, were we engaged to each other or were we married or were we engaged.</span> <span id="s1824">And I said "No, he's just a friend."</span> <span id="s1825">The Swiss did not keep men anymore, only women.</span> <span id="s1826">And I could have saved his life by just lying and saying we were a couple, but I didn't know.</span> <span id="s1827">I didn't know how mean the Swiss were at that time.</span> <span id="s1828">They were afraid that they would lose a little bit of their Russian food that just started to become a little tighter, like sugar and coffee and things like that.</span> <span id="s1829">They had plenty to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1830">Because at the top of the shortage just before the war was over, I think the food supply had come down by one percent in the whole population.</span> <span id="s1831">So, one person had less because there was hardly any refugees coming in any more.</span> <span id="s1832">February middle of February at that time, all the people, the 160 Dutch people that I met when I got to the camp in , nobody came after me any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1833">Q: That was in 1944?</span></p> <p><span id="s1834">A: February, 1944.</span> <span id="s1835">All the people that were fleeing Holland, but a long time before.</span> <span id="s1836">I was the last one to arrive of the Dutch.</span></p> <p><span id="s1837">Q: Do you know if Tony survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s1838">A: I know he did not.</span> <span id="s1839">I saw him right to his death.</span> <span id="s1840">And the worst part for me is that I could have saved his life by saying yes we were engaged.</span></p> <p><span id="s1841">Q: But he was sent back to France?</span></p> <p><span id="s1842">A: They threw people back over the border.</span> <span id="s1843">I don't know how they did it.</span> <span id="s1844">Q: But he was given over to the French police?</span></p> <p><span id="s1845">A: I don't know what they did.</span> <span id="s1846">If they sent him to France, there was not even a road.</span> <span id="s1847">Q: But you never heard of him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1848">A: No, never heard from him.</span> <span id="s1849">Q: What was his last name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1850">A: I don't remember.</span> <span id="s1851">I don't know if I ever knew because I worked with a lot of people that I didn't know the last name of.</span> <span id="s1852">I may not have asked him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1853">Q: What happened to you after you were released from jail in Switzerland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1854">A: Well, I got out of jail into kind of a clearing place where they had to have me stay for "x" number of days to see if I brought in any germs, any sicknesses.</span> <span id="s1855">My knees were swollen up like pillows, like this from the walk in the snow for ten or twelve hours because you had to walk like this.</span> <span id="s1856">The snow was so high and nobody there.</span> <span id="s1857">Nothing was trotted down.</span> <span id="s1858">We had to find our way.</span> <span id="s1859">When we hit the river, we knew that we had to follow the river until we came to the bridge, but I was pretty run down with my legs.</span> <span id="s1860">When the doctor saw how I looked, they said you could have lost the use of those legs if you would have gone much longer because you over exerted your knees and that's why it's -- it was like strawberries.</span> <span id="s1861">So, it took me a long time to get feeling a little better, but I didn't get sick.</span> <span id="s1862">And I finally got into is a big hotel at the top of a mountain and that's what the Swiss gave for the different embassies.</span> <span id="s1863">There were German refugees, Belgium refugees, there was Dutch refugees.</span> <span id="s1864">The Dutch had 160 people in that camp and so when I was finally cleared of not bringing any sicknesses, they sent me to the camp and I stayed there for a while and then I got annoyed with this kind of life and I wanted to do something and I sent a telegram to my sponsors in the United States that told me that wherever I was in the world I could call a telegram send something to New York to Garden in New York which is a big business firm, money business firm and tell Harold that I needed money and he would send it.</span> <span id="s1865">And I did.</span> <span id="s1866">And Harold died not too long after the war was over, but his son lives right here in Santa Fe.</span> <span id="s1867">One of the two kids that they had, they had two boys, and they were my friends and they also worked a little bit, and he was one of the Jewish people that did not have any fear and was acting wonderfully because when I heard that my mother's house from a stranger who called her on the phone when I was just visiting my mother.</span> <span id="s1868">I didn't live with my mother, but I was visiting my mother, that was just about ten days or twelve days after the occupation had taken over, I said to my friend, I was taking a walk with my girlfriend and I said, let's stop at my mother's because she lives alone and she wondering about my brother, who is a doctor on the other end of the country.</span> <span id="s1869">And of course every telephone connection was broken.</span> <span id="s1870">We didn't have a chance to talk to him.</span> <span id="s1871">And he had a Jewish wife, my brother, so he was considered Jewish.</span> <span id="s1872">She did go with me to see my mother.</span> <span id="s1873">And as we are there a phone rings and I look at my mother while she is answering it and I see her absolutely like this and then she hung up and the telephone call was from a stranger who came on a bicycle all the way from , which is near to tell my mother that my brother and his wife had committed suicide.</span> <span id="s1874">And of course, that was all we heard.</span></p> <p><span id="s1875">He was a stranger and brought the message.</span> <span id="s1876">And my friend was there and I said to my mother what do you want me to do.</span> <span id="s1877">Do you want me to go and see and go there?</span> <span id="s1878">And she said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s1879">And I said to my friend, will you stay here, then while I go to the other end of the country, if I can.</span> <span id="s1880">And she said, "Yes, I will."</span> <span id="s1881">So, I took off with my bicycle to the Amsterdam Hotel which is the headquarters of the Occupational Army since 10 days so it was still in an upheaval there, but the military men had taken over that hotel of which my uncle was there, which was a very strange coincidence.</span> <span id="s1882">But of course, he wasn't even there.</span> <span id="s1883">I drive my bicycle to go there and I run into Mrs. , one of my students and friends.</span> <span id="s1884">The couple was my friends, and the boys were kids.</span> <span id="s1885">She stopped me and I said "Don't stop me.</span> <span id="s1886">I have a very important thing to do."</span> <span id="s1887">And so she said, "What is it?</span> <span id="s1888">You look terrible."</span> <span id="s1889">That's the news that I got and I'm going to the Hotel, because I have to have a permit to drive to the other end of the country because all the roads are blocked.</span> <span id="s1890">Nobody is getting through with a car and I have to get permission.</span> <span id="s1891">So, she let me go and I went to the Hotel and sure enough there is military people sitting, and I said to one of the officers I would like to have you give me permit so I can drive my car.</span> <span id="s1892">I want to see, we get this news and I want to see whether my brother is still alive or what.</span> <span id="s1893">And he's starting to type me a permit and the door opens and here comes Harold, the father.</span> <span id="s1894">She went home and told her husband and he got up and he had worked on the American Embassy, full Jewish man, and he stands with the officer and he commandeers and he said you take that thing out of that machine.</span> <span id="s1895">That woman is not going alone through the country.</span> <span id="s1896">I am going to take her with my car with the American flag on it.</span> <span id="s1897">And the officer takes the thing out and he does exactly what Harold tells him to do.</span> <span id="s1898">And I never forget that moment.</span> <span id="s1899">A full Jewish man that goes in there and says you take that out and she is not going to go.</span> <span id="s1900">I am going to take her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1901">He was completely bluffed.</span> <span id="s1902">He did it, took it out, gave him the permit, he went with me, but unfortunately my brother had already been dead and buried, but she woke up because he had covered her up after he had gave her the injection and she lived for a while in hiding.</span> <span id="s1903">So, that's another whole story, much longer than I am telling you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1904">Q: That was your brother Bob?</span></p> <p><span id="s1905">A: That was my brother, Bob, yes.</span> <span id="s1906">I never saw him again, but he left a note for my mother and said, "Mother don't grieve about us, because we could have never been happy in a world like that."</span> <span id="s1907">And I thought to myself, I would have said, "Bob, the world didn't change.</span> <span id="s1908">The bad part just came too close."</span> <span id="s1909">As long as it was far away, you could still live and think of your students, because he never left the place where he lived, because he lived in that place where our bridge was blown up, he would have been trapped and he left that place because he didn't want to leave his patients without a doctor.</span> <span id="s1910">That was the type of man he was.</span> <span id="s1911">Because he didn't know when the Germans were coming, and people would say don't stay in this place because you will trapped when the bridge is blown up, because they knew that Holland would have been that strip of land that would be immediately Germany.</span> <span id="s1912">You would be trapped.</span> <span id="s1913">But he said, I don't know when that will happen so I can't leave my patients.</span> <span id="s1914">So, when it did happen, then he thought oh this world is no good anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1915">Q: What happened when you sent the telegram, did you get money or -- in Switzerland, when you were in Switzerland and you sent the telegram?</span></p> <p><span id="s1916">A: No, I went to the camp for a while, for quite a while.</span> <span id="s1917">I took the camp life and I started a choir and made people sing.</span> <span id="s1918">Finally, I got a little bored with camp life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1919">Q: What happened then when you sent the telegram to the States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1920">A: I sent a telegram to Harold that I was in the camp and that I would like to do something with my life rather than sit there and wait until the war was over and would he do what he promised me to do and that is send me some money because I would like to buy a clarinet and take clarinet lessons which would come in for my future as a conductor, to play a wind instrument.</span></p> <p><span id="s1921">Q: And he did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1922">A: Yes, he did.</span> <span id="s1923">Later on he was my houseguest because he didn't have -- his home, of course, was stolen by the Germans and I helped him recoup a lot of his things.</span> <span id="s1924">I saved his piano and I saved a fur coat of his wife.</span> <span id="s1925">I mean, I was doing -- when he left Holland, I was still there, and I took care of what I could help him with.</span></p> <p><span id="s1926">Q: But did you leave the camp after you got the money from him?</span> <span id="s1927">Did you leave the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1928">A: No, I wrote to the consulate and I said that I would like to have private support, to live privately so that I could practice.</span> <span id="s1929">I was getting tired of these 160 people who didn't do anything and they were starting to gossip about me and about my being a lesbian and treating me -- in fact there was a couple and I had gotten a cello while I was in the camp.</span> <span id="s1930">I had gotten a cello.</span> <span id="s1931">Somebody rented it for me, so I could play again, and I played a concert there with a visiting couple that played violin and viola.</span> <span id="s1932">So, we played as a concert, and I started to come alive again, because I had felt that I wasn't even alive.</span> <span id="s1933">I felt that I would never care about music anymore.</span> <span id="s1934">This lasted about a couple of months.</span> <span id="s1935">I felt dead inside.</span> <span id="s1936">I thought I would never make music anymore.</span> <span id="s1937">And then suddenly, I came kind of to myself and started that choir and then got a cello with somebody's help.</span> <span id="s1938">Then one of the people were gossiping about me, which I didn't know, wanted cello lessons.</span> <span id="s1939">And I said, yes, I can give you cello lessons because everything was for free and you can practice on my cello that I have.</span> <span id="s1940">Then, I found out that they were gossiping about my life style.</span> <span id="s1941">I called them back in and I said, -- oh, I know how I found out.</span> <span id="s1942">They had told the only lady that had a private room, because there was just one bed open in a nice room for two and she said that she didn't want to share the room with me because I was a lesbian, and I said "Oh, that's why I am in the attic where the personnel of the hotel sleeps."</span> <span id="s1943">I didn't realize that there was -- I liked private room that the help gets better than the double room that the high guests get so -- I called them in, one of the cellist in, the couple and I said, I'm not going to give you cello lessons.</span> <span id="s1944">You're not going to practice on my cello.</span> <span id="s1945">You don't want to have anything to do with me.</span> <span id="s1946">Now that I know what you did.</span> <span id="s1947">You told that lady that she shouldn't accept me in the room because you know who I am.</span> <span id="s1948">You protected her from sharing her room with a lesbian.</span> <span id="s1949">So, I don't give lessons to free to people like that, so it's finished.</span> <span id="s1950">No cello, and then they were very ashamed.</span> <span id="s1951">They were very taken aback because I read them the riot act and what was going to happen.</span> <span id="s1952">Shortly thereafter, I got a little tired of being in that camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1953">Tape #9</span></p> <p><span id="s1954">Q: First, how did these men know about you being a lesbian?</span></p> <p><span id="s1955">A: Well, first of all I was a woman musician and people know things about people and are always gossiping about people that people know.</span> <span id="s1956">So, they were acquaintances of people that I had known in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s1957">They lived in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s1958">I found that out somehow that there was a reason they had one of the house cleaners room upstairs instead of one of the guest rooms.</span> <span id="s1959">Then I found out that there was one lady that had a double room all to herself.</span> <span id="s1960">I found out why I didn't get that one, because she had told that woman don't accept a roommate because she is a lesbian.</span> <span id="s1961">Don't accept her as a roommate.</span> <span id="s1962">Somebody told me that.</span> <span id="s1963">I don't know who did, but I heard that.</span> <span id="s1964">I thought, huh, huh, and you want free cello lessons, well, that's the last one I want to give free cello lessons to.</span> <span id="s1965">But, I'm going to call them in and tell them why I made that decision, and I really told them off and they really went -- like we say in Holland -- went with their tail between their legs, their tail behind their legs.</span> <span id="s1966">They took it pretty serious, my scolding.</span> <span id="s1967">I said, "Don't ask me for anything."</span> <span id="s1968">But, I didn't like the atmosphere in the camp, and I didn't like to stay there all the time.</span> <span id="s1969">The Swiss were not very nice to us when we went out.</span> <span id="s1970">They couldn't pick the cherries.</span> <span id="s1971">The harvest was so enormous that we were allowed to go out and pick cherries for money.</span> <span id="s1972">Of course, we could never take a job, but if we picked a cherry to eat it, the door would open from the house over there and they would -- "Don't steal our cherries."</span> <span id="s1973">The floor was filled with cherries, but give it away, no.</span> <span id="s1974">I've never liked the Swiss.</span> <span id="s1975">They didn't accept us astute people.</span> <span id="s1976">When I unwittingly caused Tony to lose his life, after this trip, I can never -- it bothers me, my memory.</span></p> <p><span id="s1977">Q: You remember very well the trip but there are some parts that you seem not to remember anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1978">A: I don't remember what I did all the time in Brussels, except that they took -- you're going to have to see that story, you might be able to include that in this here.</span> <span id="s1979">There was one time in Brussels Tony came and said, "You speak English don't you, very well?"</span> <span id="s1980">And I said, "Reasonably well," and he said "I am stuck with these five pilots here in Belgium that I shot down and have been given civilian clothes by the farmers around, and they don't speak good French or anything and they need to be fed."</span></p> <p><span id="s1981">Q: You were just telling us about when Tony came and said "Do you speak English."</span></p> <p><span id="s1982">A: I said "Yes, I do."</span> <span id="s1983">He said, "We are stuck with five American pilots that are shot down and are given civilian clothes, but I cannot get them -- they have to be fed.</span> <span id="s1984">They have to eat something.</span> <span id="s1985">Can you take care of taking them to a restaurant" because nobody had food anymore, free food.</span> <span id="s1986">There was only one little restaurant nearby where I would get dinner and not have to give coupons.</span> <span id="s1987">"Can you take them there, but you can't sit down and speak English."</span> <span id="s1988">And I said, "No, that's not possible.</span> <span id="s1989">What we'll do is we won't speak at all.</span> <span id="s1990">We will just act as if I'm with people that are deaf and dumb, deaf-mute, and I will do some motions like that and hope that there is nobody that knows the language, because I don't know the finger language."</span> <span id="s1991">And that's what we did.</span> <span id="s1992">I said I'll ask them ahead of time what they would like to order and then I'll take them but we won't speak, but we'll do this and I'll have them nod or something.</span> <span id="s1993">That's how we did it.</span> <span id="s1994">We never spoke a word, until I got to my room, then I asked them before we went what they wanted to order and then afterwards I spoke with them, because I spoke -- my English was --.</span> <span id="s1995">There was one man who couldn't speak at all.</span> <span id="s1996">He was in shock.</span> <span id="s1997">He didn't say a word.</span> <span id="s1998">That was the only time that I saw them, when I took them to dinner and then they took them away.</span> <span id="s1999">I don't know how they got them away, that night or the next day.</span> <span id="s2000">That's all, but I still see their faces in my mind.</span> <span id="s2001">I remember that very well.</span> <span id="s2002">I don't remember very much from the period that I spent in Brussels.</span> <span id="s2003">I remember vividly when I left Holland on my crossing into Belgium, because we had a tiny, tiny man, way smaller man than I was, and his name was Pete, that's all we knew, and he lived right at the border.</span> <span id="s2004">He took us over the border at midnight, and it was walking from down to the border wherever we took off.</span> <span id="s2005">He lived about three houses into Belgium, and so when we got four or five houses before the place where he lived, he did this, "Don't speak, be very quiet."</span> <span id="s2006">And he opened a little gate and went into a garden and he said follow me and there was a little boy we had to take with us.</span> <span id="s2007">I never knew who the boy was, but we took off with Pete and the little boy.</span> <span id="s2008">I think he was pushed on a bicycle because it was so far to walk.</span> <span id="s2009">Then we walked that border and got into that fence and behind the houses and walked over the border that way.</span> <span id="s2010">The door was open and the light was shining over the highway but the Germans were playing cards and probably drinking beer and didn't pay attention to what was going on in the highway and didn't hear that the little gate was open.</span> <span id="s2011">We walked behind the houses over the border, because those houses were not separated.</span> <span id="s2012">It was just a road.</span> <span id="s2013">Then we went through another gate and got to Pete's house, House Number 3, maybe or 4 and we went inside and he said, "This is my house and this is my wife."</span> <span id="s2014">He was a little man about this high.</span> <span id="s2015">And he said but I have no guest room, you'll have to share the bed with me and my wife.</span> <span id="s2016">My wife will be in the middle.</span> <span id="s2017">You don't have to sleep next to me, but you can sleep next to my wife.</span> <span id="s2018">The others were on just a sofa or chair, and we were in Belgium.</span> <span id="s2019">The next day we went to Brussels.</span> <span id="s2020">I never saw Pete again.</span> <span id="s2021">I don't even know where to find him, because that would be years past.</span> <span id="s2022">But that is how I got over the border in Belgium, and I stayed in Brussels and was assigned a room.</span> <span id="s2023">I don't remember any of it.</span> <span id="s2024">I only know that I saw Tony occasionally.</span> <span id="s2025">Then I remember how I went from Brussels to Paris.</span> <span id="s2026">I just had to take the train and stop at and take the afternoon train to Paris.</span> <span id="s2027">I decided that was good because that way I would be in Paris and give me time to find my own hotel, because I didn't have any help in France.</span> <span id="s2028">That was all broken down.</span> <span id="s2029">The road had fallen apart, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s2030">I was one of the late people that got out of Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s2031">Q: What happened in ?</span></p> <p><span id="s2032">A: Yes, something happened there.</span> <span id="s2033">As I am in , I was traveling with one of the two girls I had been hiding, the author, the writer , who had lived in Northern France and who wanted me to leave her in Northern France.</span> <span id="s2034">She didn't want to go to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s2035">She just wanted to take the opportunity of my travel and stay in Northern France where she had a friend.</span> <span id="s2036">So, I said, that's fine, why not.</span> <span id="s2037">So, we took the train and that was when there was an air raid and everybody had to get off the street.</span> <span id="s2038">The street cars stopped, everything stopped because there were planes overhead.</span> <span id="s2039">So, I missed the afternoon plane to Paris, and I said, that's pretty bad, because we have no hotel in Paris and we don't know where to stay and it is not prepared.</span> <span id="s2040">We had crossed the border Belgium France and the arm of a pilot that had been shot down there too.</span> <span id="s2041">In other words, they had to get across the border, but the way we did it, I was arm in arm with one pilot, and she was arm in arm with another pilot and we just looked like some people who had lost their way.</span> <span id="s2042">We didn't look like two people who were crossing the border illegally.</span> <span id="s2043">So, we made it to .</span> <span id="s2044">What we didn't make was the train.</span> <span id="s2045">These pilots, they had an evening train, and they did not want to know us as soon as they were over the border, because they were very vulnerable too.</span> <span id="s2046">So, they said, "As soon as we are over the border, we don't know each other, and don't talk to us."</span> <span id="s2047">And I said, "That's fine."</span> <span id="s2048">So, we missed the train, but I thought that's okay because I have an address here if we get stuck from the Secret Service and I can go there and get help and they'll take me in for the night.</span> <span id="s2049">So, I said to , you wait here, I will go there.</span> <span id="s2050">And I go there and it is on the sixth floor in a very crowed street where there are lots of shops and people walking and I get there and I climb up six winding stairs, it says in the article and I find the place.</span> <span id="s2051">I ring the bell, and the door opens and I here in perfect French "Entre Madame" which means enter lady, and I look at him and it is , the only Gestapo man that I know who was arrested me in Amsterdam when I came into my neighbor's house by mistake, walk into the Gestapo and who had arrested me there and to whom I had played the dumb woman and got out of it.</span> <span id="s2052">You can read that in the article.</span></p> <p><span id="s2053">Q: Can you tell us again, what happened in Amsterdam and then what happened in Lily?</span></p> <p><span id="s2054">A: Well, in Amsterdam there was a couple that lived across the street, a Jewish couple, that didn't show up to pick up their passport which I was distributing all the time.</span> <span id="s2055">Some people came to my house to get it and some people I went to their house.</span> <span id="s2056">These people lived across the street, and they were supposed to be at a certain hour at my house, but they didn't show up.</span> <span id="s2057">I go, after everybody else has been there, I go across the street and his name was Robert Burke, and he was one of the colleagues that owned the department store in Amsterdam, and instead of fining Robert Burke, I find that I entered in the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s2058">I tried to withdraw and leave and he said "No, no, no" and he locks me up in a room.</span> <span id="s2059">We'll get to you later.</span> <span id="s2060">They were trying to find money because these were wealthy people that they were visiting to see what they could steal.</span> <span id="s2061">I said, I'm just a neighbor, never mind.</span> <span id="s2062">I know I'm stuck in the hands of the Gestapo, so I think I don't know what to do.</span> <span id="s2063">Sure enough when they were ready two of them come with me to my house.</span> <span id="s2064">Oh my God, I don't remember, do I have lying around any i.d.'s or what.</span> <span id="s2065">I saw something sticking out on the piano between music.</span> <span id="s2066">Anyway, I start playing the dummy.</span> <span id="s2067">I start doing all kind of things that mean nothing to distract them.</span> <span id="s2068">When I distracted them enough -- any way I get out with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2069">They arrested me, and I keep on playing the dummy.</span> <span id="s2070">I say I don't understand the laws.</span> <span id="s2071">I don't understand my father was Jewish and my mother was not, and I'm not considered Jewish, but my brother is because he has a Jewish wife.</span> <span id="s2072">I don't understand any of you.</span> <span id="s2073">This is in the car going to Gestapo headquarters.</span> <span id="s2074">I play as if I'm not afraid, but also I am very dumb.</span> <span id="s2075">I don't understand the laws and I don't understand -- do you mean I can't visit?</span> <span id="s2076">Oh yes, you could visit your father.</span> <span id="s2077">I said, "But my father could not visit me?"</span> <span id="s2078">That's correct, he tells me.</span> <span id="s2079">Then I take something else that was dumb, because I knew all these things.</span> <span id="s2080">I played stupid and more stupid and not afraid.</span> <span id="s2081">I sit in the back seat and these two Gestapo sitting in front and they take me to the headquarters and I'm stuck.</span> <span id="s2082">They take everything I own away and they called some car to take my possession and my food out of my refrigerator.</span> <span id="s2083">I'm arrested.</span> <span id="s2084">My mother knows that.</span> <span id="s2085">She lives in the next block.</span> <span id="s2086">Everybody knows that the Gestapo is right here and they took Frieda away.</span> <span id="s2087">I went to headquarters and I'm keeping up my comedy, my stupidity.</span> <span id="s2088">I don't know why they released me.</span> <span id="s2089">I don't look that stupid, but they thought so, luckily.</span> <span id="s2090">So, finally, after all my stuff is gone and I don't know what to do any more.</span> <span id="s2091">I have to get out of here, I have to, and he doesn't know what to do with me either, but he has to find out what I know about the other people, so I designed an escape.</span> <span id="s2092">The next time I see him walk I said "Mr. Kurt, I have something to tell you that I think will interest you."</span> <span id="s2093">So, he calls me in.</span> <span id="s2094">He thinks I thought of something that is important.</span> <span id="s2095">I said you were talking about this family Kahn, that is the co-director of his business and I think you are determined to know something about money, but I know they have a lot of money, but I said he never had any money with him because a funny thing is is that some people that I know that have a lot of money they don't carry their money with them at all.</span> <span id="s2096">When we would be out he would ask me do you have any money because I just don't have anything.</span> <span id="s2097">So, it turned out that I would always pay for something that was unexpectedly for sale that he would want or we would be stuck and stay for dinner and he never had money.</span> <span id="s2098">That all I told him.</span> <span id="s2099">He got so impatient with this dumb woman that told him a story that had nothing to do with what he was after that he takes his keys -- my keys that he has taken from me -- and he throws it on the table and says "You can go home."</span> <span id="s2100">He said to someone, "That woman can go home."</span> <span id="s2101">I said, "What do you mean, go home.</span> <span id="s2102">You have taken everything away from me.</span> <span id="s2103">When I come home there is nothing in the refrigerator.</span> <span id="s2104">I have nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s2105">Everything is out of the cupboards."</span> <span id="s2106">He said, "That's right."</span> <span id="s2107">So, he takes the phone and he calls up someone and I hear him say that all the stuff that you took out, get it back to .</span> <span id="s2108">I come home, I can't even get an automobile.</span> <span id="s2109">I had a horse and buggy loaded with my stuff coming home.</span> <span id="s2110">That's the same man that opens the door in Lily, the only Gestapo man that I have ever talked to.</span> <span id="s2111">Can you see how ridiculous the coincidences are in my life?</span> <span id="s2112">I never tell people that because they must believe I make this up.</span> <span id="s2113">It is too unbelievable, but it is true.</span> <span id="s2114">I ran for my life.</span> <span id="s2115">When he opened the door in Lily and said "Entre Madame" in perfect French, I said back in French " ", this is not what I'm looking for and ran down the stairs.</span> <span id="s2116">And as long as I hear him run after me, he's not going to shoot because he can't shoot and run at the same time.</span> <span id="s2117">I get out in the street, which is very crowded, and I go into a store that is very crowded and I hide behind a stand that is full of belts.</span> <span id="s2118">I will never forget.</span> <span id="s2119">They were hanging there and I stand behind, and I look at the door and it doesn't open.</span> <span id="s2120">He didn't see me go in.</span> <span id="s2121">I stayed there a long enough time for him to give up, because he wouldn't run in the street too long.</span> <span id="s2122">I got out and got back to the little cafe where I had left Denee and she said, "You don't look very good.</span> <span id="s2123">You look very white.</span> <span id="s2124">What happened?"</span> <span id="s2125">And I said, "Well, I have reason.</span> <span id="s2126">We have to get out of Lily, because I don't trust it.</span> <span id="s2127">He knows I'm here and he was after me."</span> <span id="s2128">So, I went to the train, and I find the two pilots that we crossed the border with, who said don't talk to me anymore and don't talk in public to us, and I said I walked by them kind of sideways, and said "I have to tell you that that address that they gave me as a resistance stopover is not good anymore.</span> <span id="s2129">Tell the headquarters, because I know you go somewhere where I don't go."</span> <span id="s2130">And that's all.</span> <span id="s2131">I walked by and never talked to them again.</span> <span id="s2132">We reached Paris, Denee and I around 11:05 and it was curfew at 12:00 and we had no hotel.</span> <span id="s2133">So, you an imagine how we ran through Paris to find a hotel that we could stay in.</span> <span id="s2134">But we found it at five minutes to twelve in a little side street off the , and I stayed there for a while.</span> <span id="s2135">I had a friend in Paris, and that was the friend who called me on the phone and said -- and her name was Bepp Bolk, and Bepp called me and said, I know an address and I said, "Hang up."</span> <span id="s2136">She didn't realize that you can't say anything on the phone.</span></p> <p><span id="s2137">Q: I would like to make a jump and go -- when did you go back to Amsterdam after the war and how was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2138">A: I went back as soon as we had a convoy back.</span> <span id="s2139">We all went back together.</span> <span id="s2140">We went back almost like cattle.</span> <span id="s2141">We didn't get a hotel.</span> <span id="s2142">We slept on straw mattresses and we were spritzed with flea powder.</span> <span id="s2143">It was misery.</span> <span id="s2144">I was sitting next to the director of one of the department stores.</span> <span id="s2145">We didn't even undress.</span> <span id="s2146">We just sat on the straw mattress and we smiled at each other and said this is not the place that we expected to go back in.</span> <span id="s2147">We really didn't expect it.</span> <span id="s2148">That was the first convoy that took us.</span> <span id="s2149">And I don't remember anything of my homecoming except that I found my apartment sealed by the Gestapo and everything in tact that I left, radio and all.</span> <span id="s2150">Everybody was without radio, but I found my radio, one of those big high ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s2151">Q: What happened to your friends, your artists friends who were in the Resistance Group, the people that you knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s2152">A: Well, the only one that I remember is in between.</span> <span id="s2153">Then I went to the United States as Herr did not like what we found back in Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s2154">Q: What did you find?</span></p> <p><span id="s2155">and his wife and there was some years did as I did because we</span></p> <p><span id="s2156">A: We found that the people that had been riding the fences, as we call it, they were on top, and the people who had given their lives, nobody was talking about it and it didn't mean anything to anybody and we had to fish for ourselves.</span> <span id="s2157">Things didn't change.</span> <span id="s2158">We thought everything would be better, politically better, and nothing, nothing changed.</span> <span id="s2159">It was a very cold shower that you got when you came back.</span> <span id="s2160">I did get musically, I got work.</span> <span id="s2161">I got some conducting to do and I got an orchestra in small town, but of course I got a little satisfaction from the government from one of what we call ministers in Holland.</span> <span id="s2162">They called me in and said how much would it take to get my orchestra back and it turned out that they didn't have any money.</span> <span id="s2163">They were impoverished after the war, too.</span> <span id="s2164">So, there was nothing and they didn't do anything for .</span> <span id="s2165">It was the same old stuff.</span> <span id="s2166">And the mediocre people were ruling the roost.</span> <span id="s2167">You never heard about the people that had given their lives for it.</span> <span id="s2168">They never made any remark about it.</span> <span id="s2169">They never did anything or asked for the family, do you need any help or anything like that, nothing.</span> <span id="s2170">Everybody fished for themselves and as did the same thing.</span> <span id="s2171">There was no cleansing of anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s2172">Tape #10</span></p> <p><span id="s2173">Q: Let's start where we stopped yesterday.</span> <span id="s2174">You told us you were coming back to Amsterdam and that you were very dissatisfied with how people dealt with former members of the Resistance, and that this was for you the major reason to leave the Netherlands.</span> <span id="s2175">Can you tell us more about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2176">A: I can only tell you that the general feeling that I had of disinterest people didn't talk about what happened during the war, I just resumed my efforts to get my musical work going again, which I had left actually since the beginning of the war, because there was no orchestra to conduct and there were very few students who were interested.</span> <span id="s2177">So, even in the five years, I had very little work, musical work, if any, the first year.</span> <span id="s2178">So, when I came back, I had to build it up.</span> <span id="s2179">I didn't have any old students.</span> <span id="s2180">Some were killed, some were gone, so I didn't have a chance -- I did speak with the minister of the arts because he called me in and that was the only gesture that I noticed of that one man who knew that I had had that orchestra.</span> <span id="s2181">He give me an assignment to try it and recreate my orchestra, and that turned out to be way too expensive, so that was dropped.</span> <span id="s2182">Then, shortly thereafter, I got some other work in and I had a write up of concerts to take to .</span> <span id="s2183">They were very happy with me.</span> <span id="s2184">That was the only thing that was happy, that I had some community orchestra, not professional, amateur, but a good orchestra.</span> <span id="s2185">I could work that up while I started to teach again.</span> <span id="s2186">That's all I had in conducting.</span> <span id="s2187">But the whole atmosphere to me was dull, very dull and unexciting, and people were not talking about the past.</span> <span id="s2188">They were not talking about what happened, and of course, I didn't feel like talking about it myself.</span> <span id="s2189">I was glad that there was peace.</span> <span id="s2190">But nobody was mentioning those five years that I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s2191">They were just doing their own thing and trying to make money and make a living, but in a very dull kind of atmosphere.</span> <span id="s2192">There was no enthusiasm anywhere.</span> <span id="s2193">I felt unfamiliar.</span> <span id="s2194">My mood was do something different, and there was nothing really different.</span></p> <p><span id="s2195">Q: Were you recognized for what you did for the resistance?</span></p> <p><span id="s2196">A: No, absolutely not.</span> <span id="s2197">I didn't talk about it and nobody talked about it that I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s2198">Everybody was trying to get his feet on the ground and get a job and make a living.</span> <span id="s2199">The people that had not taken a strong stand were kind of on top.</span> <span id="s2200">I mean, they were the people who did well.</span> <span id="s2201">I was not a political figure myself.</span> <span id="s2202">I was not a person that was concerned in politics.</span> <span id="s2203">I was not in a party or anything like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2204">Q: Do you know if now people in the Netherlands do know about your years in the Resistance and what you did?</span> <span id="s2205">Is that documented?</span></p> <p><span id="s2206">A: I don't think so, because the reason that I say no is that students of mine have heard me talk about those years and went to the different centers like the and the Holocaust Museum and they said your name is nowhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s2207">Q: At the Holocaust Museum in Israel or which one?</span></p> <p><span id="s2208">A: I think there are displays of names, and I looked under the B and I didn't see me name, and they started to get very upset, because they knew that I wouldn't make that up, but they said your name is not anywhere.</span> <span id="s2209">It's only been very recently that I heard that.</span> <span id="s2210">I never knew that.</span> <span id="s2211">I knew that somebody said your name is not in the .</span> <span id="s2212">And so said that she did not belong to any group, and that alerted me at first and that made me say yes, when I got the letter, would I like the story published, and I said yes.</span> <span id="s2213">Because that was not the reason I said no before I moved here.</span> <span id="s2214">I said no because I was still working and I thought oh why should it be documented.</span> <span id="s2215">I'm not that very important of a person.</span> <span id="s2216">But this made me say yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2217">Q: Do you know -- we talked yesterday night about how the attack on the population register is remember in the Netherlands and that the leader of this attack in memory right now is .</span> <span id="s2218">Did you know that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2219">A: No, I didn't, because to me it was always , because I knew he was the leader and was the second man.</span> <span id="s2220">So, when I got the little book about that said he was the first man and was not, I knew that was the only one survivor for a while of the active group that did it, but I knew right away that he was not the leader, because I worked in direct contact with and I never worked with , but I knew that he slipped through the mazes just like I did, and he continued to work.</span> <span id="s2221">He did a lot of I would say spectacular things after that and was almost killed another time and was shot.</span> <span id="s2222">I knew some of that story, but people would have said he was the head, I would say no he was not.</span> <span id="s2223">He was not even there in direct planning.</span> <span id="s2224">He wasn't even in the meeting.</span> <span id="s2225">What is in the German my name is in there, was not in that meeting.</span> <span id="s2226">He did other things.</span> <span id="s2227">That's all I knew.</span> <span id="s2228">But it never came to me until I heard it from you and from the book, and I never wondered why, because I have never seen the obvious omission of name because I didn't pay attention.</span> <span id="s2229">But for me he was always the first man and for me he was the great hero who was most willing to give his life for the cause.</span> <span id="s2230">It was just an amazing performance.</span></p> <p><span id="s2231">Q: We talked yesterday about the reasons why the attack and the leadership of this attack was remembered differently, and one of the major reasons seems to be that was known to be openly gay --?</span></p> <p><span id="s2232">A: Right.</span> <span id="s2233">I didn't know it was kept a secret until later, so I understand.</span> <span id="s2234">There is only one reason to ignore, and that is is that he was gay.</span> <span id="s2235">There is no other reason.</span> <span id="s2236">There was nothing wrong with him as a human being so there could only be one reason, his sexual orientation, which I think is the most dishonest and stupid thing, but I didn't know it until I found that out.</span> <span id="s2237">Actually, I never talked with anybody about it, because it didn't come to me that it was so blatantly ignored.</span> <span id="s2238">It is unbelievable that people dare to do that.</span> <span id="s2239">It was so far from my thinking, and I'm so disinterested in what people do in their private life, I think we will be very surprised if we know what the so called heterosexual people do in their private life.</span> <span id="s2240">I think we would be very, I would say, disgusted, and surprised if we knew, which is nobody's business.</span> <span id="s2241">Everybody's life is his own and it is not a public matter to my thinking, and I have never given it a thought.</span> <span id="s2242">People shouldn't give it a thought because they don't know.</span> <span id="s2243">They don't know what anybody does in his own home.</span> <span id="s2244">So, there's no interest on my part, and I don't think there should be an interest on anybody else's part and it was overreacted about that way, and there are so many in between I would say of human beings and if we started to analyze that, I think we'd be spending our time in the wrong direction.</span> <span id="s2245">I don't think it's an interesting subject.</span> <span id="s2246">People make it an interesting subject and they categorize people and I don't categorize people in that respect at all.</span> <span id="s2247">I categorize people into their value as a human being.</span> <span id="s2248">And I think, unfortunately, I meet more bad ones than good ones.</span> <span id="s2249">I think the human race is nothing to be proud of.</span> <span id="s2250">I'd much rather be a bird or an elephant or whatever, because I think the human race has definitely has much more evil traits in the total, not in everybody, but if you look at the amount of people, you don't find superb innocent, honest, etc.</span> <span id="s2251">I can give you a whole list of words, but you find a lot of evil and even more so now than when I was younger.</span> <span id="s2252">I don't think the human race is advancing in the right direction.</span></p> <p><span id="s2253">There's more murder, there's more greed, there's more of all those things.</span> <span id="s2254">People have lost the pleasure that comes from work, from doing things yourself, partly it's through the advancement in machines that do it for us.</span> <span id="s2255">I don't like to have machines, I don't want a computer.</span> <span id="s2256">I see that a computer is a great danger because people can wreck the whole system, can steal much easier.</span> <span id="s2257">Everything is made easier.</span> <span id="s2258">I mean, every bad thing is made easier.</span> <span id="s2259">There's no advantage from having machines do all the work for you.</span> <span id="s2260">We get lazier.</span> <span id="s2261">We don't have any joy in doing it ourselves.</span> <span id="s2262">I've known man who made, for instance, something from scratch that he could buy, of course he could buy a pocket knife or a butcher knife.</span> <span id="s2263">He started from scratch with a piece of metal and he got great joy in doing something with his hands that was hand made and that took him maybe half a year to make that knife.</span> <span id="s2264">I can understand it.</span> <span id="s2265">I think that's the general feeling I have, and I think we occupy our minds with the wrong things, too.</span> <span id="s2266">Any questions?</span></p> <p><span id="s2267">Q: I'd like to go back -- I really want to know exactly what was the major reason that you left the Netherlands and went to the States?</span></p> <p><span id="s2268">A: Because I didn't have the same feeling of joy in my work.</span> <span id="s2269">I didn't have the same feeling to build something up.</span> <span id="s2270">See, I have been a little bit unaware of some parts of life, because I focused on too much of what I did.</span> <span id="s2271">I didn't include everything that was going in life.</span> <span id="s2272">I kind of focused too much on the music and my teaching, and the world is so rich in avenues.</span> <span id="s2273">One can branch out in so many directions.</span> <span id="s2274">I didn't branch out very much in politics before, I told you.</span> <span id="s2275">Music can take up so much time and give so much satisfaction and I also know that music has a tremendous influence which interested me much more to pursue than to broaden my scope and get, say, into a political party or something like that.</span> <span id="s2276">One cannot embrace everything.</span> <span id="s2277">Life has much too much of offer, so we always specialized in a certain direction.</span></p> <p><span id="s2278">I felt that the atmosphere was dull.</span> <span id="s2279">There was no general enthusiasm for everything that was done.</span> <span id="s2280">I did my little corner.</span> <span id="s2281">I did my music, but it was not quite the same.</span> <span id="s2282">There was no feeling of renewing after the war.</span> <span id="s2283">There was no feeling of change after the war.</span> <span id="s2284">It was all the same, and even, I would say, more dull than it was before.</span></p> <p><span id="s2285">Q: Were you disappointed that what meant to you a lot of work in the Resistance, obviously didn't mean a lot after the war to a lot of people?</span></p> <p><span id="s2286">A: Do you mean that people didn't talk about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2287">Q: Yes, or that they were not interested in what happened exactly in the war years?</span></p> <p><span id="s2288">A: No, because I really didn't want to look back all the time for my own self.</span> <span id="s2289">I didn't like people to talk about it too much because I didn't think about it too much.</span> <span id="s2290">And I never expected it to be so neglected, because I didn't really go around in circles where there was a lot of talk.</span> <span id="s2291">I was always very busy with what I was doing.</span> <span id="s2292">And then, I didn't feel there was that enthusiasm to build up something new, even musically.</span> <span id="s2293">I mean, people were, the right people were not enthusiastic to do anything, do you know what I'm saying?</span> <span id="s2294">It was the same old thing, but even less enthusiasm than there was before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s2295">Q: How and when did you emigrate to the States?</span></p> <p><span id="s2296">A: Well, I really only did it when a friend of mine, who I have mentioned to you before, Harold came to Holland a couple of times to recoup what he had left and what the Germans had tried to steal and rob him of, because he was a very wealthy man.</span> <span id="s2297">He said to me, "You are the only one I would like to sponsor.</span> <span id="s2298">If you want to come to the United States, you need a sponsor, and you're the only one that I know who would be able to get on your own feet.</span> <span id="s2299">Because you have to get on your own, but you have a year's time and that year I have to take care of you.</span> <span id="s2300">If you want to do it, why don't you go with us back to the United States, this time and see how you like it."</span> <span id="s2301">And so I did.</span> <span id="s2302">I went with them.</span> <span id="s2303">I didn't tell anybody.</span> <span id="s2304">I had a Visa.</span> <span id="s2305">I said I'm just going to spend the summer and so that's how I was really trying how to do it.</span> <span id="s2306">I suddenly felt kind of an opening up of an opportunity to start, really start with something different and something new and I just didn't feel any interest coming in or going out to try step by step to build up something in Holland because I had lost the people that -- the two cellists, and the violinist were killed in concentration camps, and you know, there was only one man left of the whole Jewish group that I had.</span> <span id="s2307">I mean things were disappointing to have to regenerate, so I went to the United States and until two days before I left, I worked, because I remember I was doing some radio broadcasting and I ran into the sister of one of my school mates and I said "I have no time to talk to you because I have to go to the other studio."</span> <span id="s2308">I had my cello in the other hand and my music in the right and she said "My sister is there.</span> <span id="s2309">My sister is in New York."</span> <span id="s2310">And I said, "I know, I went to school with her."</span> <span id="s2311">And she said, "Well, if you go to New York, go and see her."</span> <span id="s2312">And she wrote her address and name and put it in, because I had no hand free to take the address, and she put it in my pocket and the next day I quit working and took the boat and went to New York, and I had the slip of paper, and I found the friend.</span> <span id="s2313">And she said, "There you are" when I came in, and I said, "What do you mean, there are you?"</span> <span id="s2314">She said, "I followed your career in all the magazines that I got sent from Holland.</span> <span id="s2315">I know exactly, and I thought one day she'll come into New York."</span> <span id="s2316">I said, yes, not only that, she had a very nice apartment and my sponsors lived in a very expensive place.</span> <span id="s2317">My room was nothing and it cost a fortune.</span></p> <p><span id="s2318">So, I said to my friend, I said, Harold, I think I can find a place that wouldn't cost anything, would you like me to move there because I still don't know what to do yet.</span> <span id="s2319">He said, I would appreciate it because they charge a fortune for a room here.</span> <span id="s2320">So, I moved in with her and went back and forth to my friends, spent some time in New York.</span> <span id="s2321">I met an old friend who had known my father and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s2322">I said, "Well, what do you think?"</span> <span id="s2323">His name was Sylvan and I said, "Sylvan, what do you think of my staying in New York?"</span> <span id="s2324">I said, "It is so crowded here and there are so many people here, so many musicians here."</span> <span id="s2325">He said, "Well, there's always room for a good one."</span> <span id="s2326">Well, I decided it was not something for me, New York.</span> <span id="s2327">It was just too big.</span> <span id="s2328">So, I talked to my friend and I said you know the idea that I would like to do is to have a car and go through the United States and visit all kinds of places and see where I would like to settle down.</span> <span id="s2329">I said but I cannot ask my sponsor to buy a car.</span></p> <p><span id="s2330">This was '47 and they didn't make cars.</span> <span id="s2331">There were only second hand cars, and that would have been fine for me.</span> <span id="s2332">But she said, "Oh, I can buy the car, but I want to buy a new car."</span> <span id="s2333">And I said, "Well, Minnie, there are no new cars."</span> <span id="s2334">She said, "There is a new car made.</span> <span id="s2335">It's called a Crosley and they sell it in Macy's Department Store and I will buy a Crosley because I am principally against a used car."</span> <span id="s2336">So, off we go to Macy's Department Store and buy a Cosely.</span> <span id="s2337">It's like a toy, a convertible.</span> <span id="s2338">she bought it and we took off in the Crosley.</span> <span id="s2339">We managed on my allowance, which was the whole allowance was $5,000 for one whole year, and of course, they didn't say I can't do this.</span> <span id="s2340">I went all over the United States.</span> <span id="s2341">I had addresses to go.</span> <span id="s2342">I had recommendations that brought me criss crossed like that.</span> <span id="s2343">Niagara Falls, the first one was the father of my Russian -- not the one that I talked about before -- but I had a Russian accompanist in Holland.</span> <span id="s2344">She said my brother lives in Buffalo.</span> <span id="s2345">I said, that will be my first stop from New York to Buffalo.</span> <span id="s2346">I stayed there for three days, and I had my cello with me and my friend Minnie who paid for the car and so it was the two of us with the cello and two suitcases plus coats and things.</span> <span id="s2347">That Crosley was loaded to here.</span> <span id="s2348">Well, that is a story by itself that fills chapters.</span> <span id="s2349">But we went all the way through various states.</span></p> <p><span id="s2350">I've even been to Albuquerque, San Antonio in Texas, I mean, San Francisco Conservatory.</span> <span id="s2351">We were on the way for a whole month and traveled everywhere.</span> <span id="s2352">It was a wonderful experience.</span> <span id="s2353">It was so refreshing for me.</span> <span id="s2354">The Americans were very hospitable.</span> <span id="s2355">I had lots of letters of introduction.</span> <span id="s2356">It was a complete fresh beginning for me.</span> <span id="s2357">The people didn't have any idea of what Europe went through and what Holland went through.</span> <span id="s2358">They were very open minded and very hospitable.</span> <span id="s2359">I stayed many times in friends of friends house.</span> <span id="s2360">The one in Buffalo had someone in Oklahoma City, a doctor who was the brother of her husband and so forth and so on, and they would take us in as if it was the simplest thing.</span> <span id="s2361">They were very interested in music, very interested in stories about what Europe went through and all that.</span> <span id="s2362">It was very refreshing for me.</span> <span id="s2363">And I decided I would like to stay, so I had to make a living so when I boarded the boat I had a nice adventure to go across because I went across by myself.</span> <span id="s2364">I didn't go with my sponsor.</span> <span id="s2365">He was already in the United States and I was by myself and I was interested in the Dutch people.</span> <span id="s2366">I wanted to learn to speak English and the whole dining room was filled when I decided that I was getting hungry and I stood at the door of the dining room looking at this sea of heads where there would be some room and way in the distance a lady was pointing like this.</span> <span id="s2367">I looked, how strange, and she looked again at me and did the same thing.</span> <span id="s2368">So, I walked over there and she said, "Why don't you sit here, there's a chair."</span> <span id="s2369">She was British.</span></p> <p><span id="s2370">Tape #11</span></p> <p><span id="s2371">Q: You were just telling the scene when you were standing at the door and someone was pointing at the chair.</span></p> <p><span id="s2372">A: So, I sat down there and found out that she was a British woman and I thought, great.</span> <span id="s2373">She said this is a wonderful table.</span> <span id="s2374">Well, I didn't get to that table, because I had a different sitting, different hours.</span> <span id="s2375">But, I met her the next day, and she said, do you like your table and I said, "Oh, no."</span> <span id="s2376">And she said, "Why don't you go to the Purser and ask.</span> <span id="s2377">Our table is wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s2378">Somebody from Bermuda, somebody from there, all single people."</span> <span id="s2379">And so I did.</span> <span id="s2380">I had moved to all these interesting people and we became friends aboard ship because I didn't want to talk Dutch, so I was very happy to find a British person who was interesting and interested in talking to me and so we had two deck chairs rented for the whole trip.</span> <span id="s2381">All I did was speak English aboard ship, but she lived in Pasadena and I was going to New York, so I we took each other's address and we wrote letters and I went with my friends to Vermont for the summer and stayed in New York.</span> <span id="s2382">That's when I bought the Crosley.</span> <span id="s2383">Many of my school friends bought the Crosley and she said if you drive I'll buy the car, and we drove all the way through the country, zig zag.</span> <span id="s2384">And I had my introductions for other conductors even , Lake Erie, was a cousin of the famous composer, so I had a lot of interesting people to meet.</span> <span id="s2385">So, I didn't go straight anywhere but I went wherever I had a stop and saw a lot of the United States with this girlfriend.</span> <span id="s2386">When we got to California, which was in December, she said I had to go back to New York because my vacation is up.</span> <span id="s2387">She worked in the Dutch Embassy.</span> <span id="s2388">She said you can keep the car because it's no good in New York.</span> <span id="s2389">I am a little tired of my job anyway, so why don't you keep the car and I will walk later and I don't mind to move myself to California.</span> <span id="s2390">That is the country I chose to be and because I had contact with my British friend and she said you can stay with us because you can't find an apartment.</span> <span id="s2391">There is no apartment to be found here.</span> <span id="s2392">So, you have to be somebody's guest and I would love to share my home with you, but I have two bachelor brothers.</span> <span id="s2393">I said that's fine.</span> <span id="s2394">I love it.</span> <span id="s2395">So, we stayed, friends and I stayed there and then I took her in the car sometimes and sometimes I went on my own because I had all kinds of introductions.</span> <span id="s2396">I went to San Francisco to see the conservatory there and talk to the head and he said "I have something for you."</span> <span id="s2397">I mean, I looked for work.</span> <span id="s2398">Then I got an introduction, because we arrived in December and I contacted all the places I could, because I liked way better to live in California.</span> <span id="s2399">Physically I feel better in a warmer country.</span> <span id="s2400">I have arthritis and I didn't like cold countries.</span> <span id="s2401">I visited Albuquerque and the radiator of the little Crosley froze overnight.</span> <span id="s2402">I mean, I became a mechanic during that trip because of all the things the Crosley could not do.</span> <span id="s2403">It was like a sewing machine.</span> <span id="s2404">It didn't get up hill, even.</span> <span id="s2405">It stalled.</span> <span id="s2406">One of the pistons always flew out.</span> <span id="s2407">I had my hat under the hood many times, but I still had the Crosley to get around.</span> <span id="s2408">I went to visit on recommendation to visit a woman, a music critic, in Long Beach and she looked at my paraphernalia that I had from Europe and she said, "My goodness, that's a background you have.</span> <span id="s2409">You should be able to -- why don't you, it's a little bit late now, but why don't you see this man.</span> <span id="s2410">I'll give you his address.</span> <span id="s2411">He's going to open a music camp here in the mountains.</span> <span id="s2412">Maybe there's something you can do there."</span> <span id="s2413">So, I did.</span> <span id="s2414">I went to see this man, and he looked at the same things, my papers, and he said, "My, I wish I'd seen you earlier."</span> <span id="s2415">And I said, "Why?"</span> <span id="s2416">And he said, "Because you have such a wonderful background as a conductor and musician and cellist, but all the jobs are taken for next summer."</span> <span id="s2417">And he said, "Gee, I would like to have you there."</span> <span id="s2418">He said, "All I can offer you really is being in a cabin with six girls and people and coach the strings, but I can't give you a salary.</span> <span id="s2419">I can't hire you, but you can come there for free and help out with whatever you can do, if that appeals to you."</span> <span id="s2420">He said, "It's a beautiful spot.</span> <span id="s2421">It's called Blue Jay camp, and it's like a miniature Hollywood.</span> <span id="s2422">It has wonderful acoustics and this is our first year."</span> <span id="s2423">He said "You can even bring a friend for free because I could use some non-professional help."</span> <span id="s2424">I said, "I'll take it.</span> <span id="s2425">Thank you."</span> <span id="s2426">So, I did.</span> <span id="s2427">Well, that started me.</span> <span id="s2428">That is the type events in my life that I've had many of times that I just float with the stream and something comes around and there's nothing better to do comes the second time.</span> <span id="s2429">This was the first time in the United States, because I did come in the summer thinking that I would be just a little helper.</span> <span id="s2430">He said maybe I can even have you help out you know at rehearsal, but he said for every Sunday, I think there was six weeks of it, for every Sunday there's a famous conductor coming in, a well known conductor.</span> <span id="s2431">One is and he mentioned everybody and he said you'll me them and I said, that's fine.</span> <span id="s2432">And I came that summer and there was a resident conductor who would come from San Diego.</span> <span id="s2433">He lost his wife.</span> <span id="s2434">He didn't show up.</span> <span id="s2435">I was there.</span> <span id="s2436">The second was Richard Lert (ph) who was also well known in Pasadena.</span> <span id="s2437">He had an ear infection.</span> <span id="s2438">He didn't show up.</span> <span id="s2439">So, I became the resident conductor who prepared the orchestra all week, conducted every morning, made a program, received the guest conductor would only conduct one piece so I would conduct the program all the time and met all these conductors.</span> <span id="s2440">I have a picture, two pictures where I stand with .</span> <span id="s2441">I had an introduction for from some student friend in Holland that he had studied music with before he became famous , and I had never destroyed that letter of introduction.</span> <span id="s2442">Little did I know that I could meet him like this, but that's exactly how my life rose.</span> <span id="s2443">I am there for unknown reason at the right time so I not only have a picture of that day came and that he said why don't you let me hear, because I haven't had lunch, I would like to have lunch first and read my letter from this violinist and he said what have they played and I said, "oh they have a Beethoven Symphony movement."</span> <span id="s2444">He said, "I want to hear them."</span> <span id="s2445">I said, "Oh but they are sitting waiting for this famous and then I come."</span> <span id="s2446">He said, "No, I want to hear them.</span> <span id="s2447">Just tell them I want to hear them."</span> <span id="s2448">So, I go down there.</span> <span id="s2449">We played a movement of the symphony and he sits up there having lunch and he comes down there when it is over and claps and they are sitting up is clapping for them and he said "Don't be so proud of your achievement because an orchestra is what it's conductor is."</span> <span id="s2450">And he bowed in my direction.</span> <span id="s2451">I will never forget that, because they played well and that he bowed to me that I had prepared.</span> <span id="s2452">Then he did his piece and I never followed through.</span> <span id="s2453">I mean I never went and said would you do this for me or that for me, but I mean we had a wonderful time and he wanted pictures taken and I still have the pictures where he's standing with his blue overcoat in his hand because it was hot.</span> <span id="s2454">Anyway, the next Sunday, I get another guest conductor who is the head of the music department of UCLA, the University of California, and I see right away he's not an .</span> <span id="s2455">When the concert is over that means they go home and the next Sunday somebody else is coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s2456">So, as he leaves he says to me, come to see me in September.</span> <span id="s2457">I said "Aren't you a busy man?"</span> <span id="s2458">And he said, "Yes, but not too busy for you."</span> <span id="s2459">I said, "Well," he seems to be serious, so of course I am going to see him in September and he offers me a job.</span> <span id="s2460">This is my first year as an emigrate so I had a job.</span> <span id="s2461">It wasn't very much of a job and it didn't pay very much, but I did get a job.</span> <span id="s2462">So, I did that.</span> <span id="s2463">Now comes the year I get more known and I make more friends and lived in California, which of course is very close to the movie studio world, Hollywood.</span> <span id="s2464">So, I meet people more and more and I find my old friend Alice the harpsichord player who teaches at the University of Southern California, two big universities and she said "Where is the viola ."</span> <span id="s2465">I said, "Oh."</span> <span id="s2466">We had concerts you know harpsichord in the days of my husband with the flute.</span> <span id="s2467">Flute, harpsichord and viola and it was not my viola it was .</span> <span id="s2468">So I said I don't have.</span> <span id="s2469">She said I'll get you a and sure enough I played a concert viola and harpsichord, just duet.</span> <span id="s2470">I have to tell you a funny story about that, because I have played that in Europe and so I have among the paraphanelia that I showed everybody, I have two prospectus prints made just pictures of me in Holland to have in the United States when I get there and I carried that always in my portfolio.</span> <span id="s2471">One is Frieda Belinfante Cello and violadagamba and I also had one that was Frieda Belinfante conductor because I didn't want it all together on one sheet because people think you don't do anything well so in New York I had offered this to an agent to look at it and she said I have one woman cellist and she can't even make a living.</span> <span id="s2472">She said, "Do you have anything else?"</span> <span id="s2473">I said, "Yes, I have Frieda Belinfante, conductor."</span> <span id="s2474">She said, "That's worse."</span> <span id="s2475">I said, "Well, goodbye."</span> <span id="s2476">That is all the success I had in New York, but I still carried these two with me all over the place.</span> <span id="s2477">So, I get an engagement.</span> <span id="s2478">Somebody wants a cello and violin and piano and asked the three of us for material and I have to put here Frieda Belinfante, cello and on the other side it says violadagamba because I play both, and the other sheet was Frieda Belinfante, conductor.</span> <span id="s2479">So, of course I give this sheet of the cello because I'm going to play cello and the violinist gets her sheet -- I still know her name, Lisa Mengete (ph), and there was a Russian pianist who had no material to give to the agent.</span> <span id="s2480">So she said, "Oh well, just forget it."</span> <span id="s2481">So, I pick up the newspapers in Santa Monica where we played and I see that the concert is announced and it says Lisa Mengete, violin, Frieda Belinfante, cello and Violadagamba piano.</span> <span id="s2482">I've never laughed so hard in my life because it was so funny.</span> <span id="s2483">I never thought anything, but unfortunately I lost the paper.</span> <span id="s2484">It was the Santa Monica paper that said that violadagamba will play the piano.</span> <span id="s2485">So, anyway, that's a nice story, lots of musical jokes, but this was one of the best.</span> <span id="s2486">Anyway, I got my job at the university which was I went to see the head of the class, and he was actually more of an administrator, this man, who was the head at the time, and he was conducting the orchestra and he wanted an assistant conductor.</span> <span id="s2487">So, I was the one.</span> <span id="s2488">He needed a cello teacher who was also a conductor, so I go the assignment of being just that, the cello teacher which he didn't have and assistant conductor, but he was the main one.</span> <span id="s2489">He was a bad one, because he was more of an administrator and that of course cooked my goose because at one time he could not cut the mustard and asked me to do it and I could cut the mustard and that's the end of me.</span> <span id="s2490">So, I didn't stay there very long, just a couple of years.</span> <span id="s2491">But, it wasn't too bad because the pay was very poor.</span> <span id="s2492">I made $100 a month and I had to be there when he said so, when he had an orchestra rehearsal or something.</span> <span id="s2493">I got calls from the movie studio as a freelancer which paid me $100 a day, so I didn't show up on one his rehearsals, so I lost it again, the job, but at least I had it for the first year.</span> <span id="s2494">And I got more and more studio calls and stuff, but I got ahead and made my own living after a year.</span> <span id="s2495">Then, the same asked me one time would you be able to help a friend of mine out.</span> <span id="s2496">He is a conductor in one of the suburbs of Los Angeles and he needs a first cellist and he doesn't have one and his concert is nearby, but I'm kind of ashamed to tell you what it pays.</span> <span id="s2497">It pays $17, because it's one of those union -- and it's mostly for an orchestra that's not professional, but they need a first cellist and he doesn't have one.</span> <span id="s2498">I didn't have much to do yet, so I said okay, I will help out, why not.</span> <span id="s2499">I'll come.</span> <span id="s2500">I don't care that it only pays $17, but I'll do it.</span> <span id="s2501">So, I did.</span> <span id="s2502">I went to rehearsal and started to talk to people.</span> <span id="s2503">One guy comes up to me and he said your name is Belinfante?</span></p> <p><span id="s2504">Well, I talked to a friend of mine and he said you know there is a woman conductor that is well known in Europe by that name and he said, is that a relative?"</span> <span id="s2505">I said, "No, that's me."</span> <span id="s2506">He said, "Are you crazy?"</span> <span id="s2507">I said, "Why, no."</span> <span id="s2508">He said, "Well, if that's you that you play for $17 for this jerk."</span> <span id="s2509">I said, "Well I have no orchestra and I'm just helping him out."</span> <span id="s2510">He said, "Is it possible that is you."</span> <span id="s2511">I said, "Yes, I had my own orchestra in Holland, semi professional, and I conducted for the radio."</span> <span id="s2512">He said, "Would you like to conduct?"</span> <span id="s2513">And I said, "Of course, I would, but you can't just say, here I am.</span> <span id="s2514">I am a conductor where is my orchestra?"</span> <span id="s2515">He said, "I'll get you an orchestra.</span> <span id="s2516">It doesn't pay, but I'll get you an orchestra."</span> <span id="s2517">I said, "Are you serious?"</span> <span id="s2518">He said, "Yes, because there are so many musicians here in Hollywood that never play a symphony that always play these noises that you see on the film, a little of this and somebody falls down the stairs, and a little of this.</span> <span id="s2519">They don't play symphony.</span> <span id="s2520">There is only one symphony in Los Angeles and I don't enjoy what they are playing, but it makes good money."</span> <span id="s2521">I said, "I know it does because I've done it myself."</span> <span id="s2522">And so he said, "I'll get you an orchestra, but it doesn't pay."</span> <span id="s2523">I said, "It doesn't matter.</span> <span id="s2524">I'd like to."</span> <span id="s2525">So, to make it very short, he said, "There are rules here that if musicians get together and they play, there will be a room available for them in the auditorium, a podium, in schools in the evening and there will be a janitor that turns on the lights and is responsible.</span></p> <p><span id="s2526">The City is paying for that.</span> <span id="s2527">I'll get you an orchestra, but nobody gets paid.</span> <span id="s2528">You have to do it for pleasure.</span> <span id="s2529">There's one problem, that's music."</span> <span id="s2530">I said, "Oh no, that's no problem.</span> <span id="s2531">I can rent music for free from the Library, and I know how that's done."</span> <span id="s2532">So, I said, "It's a deal, wonderful, I'll do it."</span> <span id="s2533">And so I did go to the Library and deposit a $100 and got music in parts.</span> <span id="s2534">I said you tell me when you're ready, when you have your orchestra together.</span> <span id="s2535">He did, in Highland Avenue High School I got an auditorium, I got a janitor.</span> <span id="s2536">Nobody paid anything, it was city.</span> <span id="s2537">I come on a given day and there was an orchestra there, complete, not too big, but complete.</span> <span id="s2538">I got one symphony and on another symphony music and parts and we played and we enjoyed and I said, "Would you people like to come back next week?"</span> <span id="s2539">Yes.</span> <span id="s2540">I had one clarinet player with one leg, Glen Johnson, one of the most faithful with his wooden leg putting down on one side, played beautifully, that came back every week for maybe a couple of months.</span> <span id="s2541">And then the same guy who got the people together, came to me and said, you know, we have a demand for a concert and we don't even have a name.</span> <span id="s2542">And I said, "What is the concert?"</span> <span id="s2543">He said "It's to be in the Redlands Ball."</span> <span id="s2544">Redland is a town inland and an old lady is the head of that ball.</span> <span id="s2545">I don't know if she owned it or what, and we go to play and the soloist that she likes the orchestra to play with and I said, "Oh, call it whatever you want."</span> <span id="s2546">But he said, there's very little money but it's better than nothing and all the musicians will get paid for the concert and it will pay each one $30.</span> <span id="s2547">I said well, I'm sure they will be glad to get $30 because they did it for free.</span> <span id="s2548">So, sure enough we got the concert at the Redlands Ball and was the soloist and we called it the Beethoven Group.</span> <span id="s2549">We didn't know what else to do.</span> <span id="s2550">And I had time for an overture so she played an Beethoven piano concerto and she said that Mrs. Mullen, who engaged us, wanted her to play twice, which I found out was not true, she wanted to play twice.</span> <span id="s2551">But anyway she had a Strauss piece for after intermission and I had the symphony and an overture, so each had two pieces.</span> <span id="s2552">I had to conduct two pieces.</span> <span id="s2553">Well, it was the most beautiful evening and the most beautiful concert.</span> <span id="s2554">It was in the summer an it was not a breeze.</span> <span id="s2555">There was moonlight and the whole ball was filled, poetic as could be and she played a Beethoven concerto and she tried to conduct me and I put her hand down and I said, "This is my department."</span> <span id="s2556">I mean she had the feeling what can a woman conductor be and maybe I better take that quickly, the roles were divided.</span> <span id="s2557">I played the Mozart overture.</span> <span id="s2558">She played a Beethoven concerto, and she had a husband with her that said "Darling, aren't you too tired to go right on the stage again with the Strauss piece."</span> <span id="s2559">And I heard that and I stood there and I said, "If Darling is too tired, we'll drop the piece, but we're not going to change the program.</span> <span id="s2560">She will have to play the piece and then I will play the symphony.</span> <span id="s2561">We're not going to change the program."</span> <span id="s2562">So, we didn't.</span> <span id="s2563">So, she played her Strauss piece and I played the symphony.</span> <span id="s2564">They played so well, because I didn't use a score.</span> <span id="s2565">I never did.</span> <span id="s2566">I stood in this beautiful moonlight and a little girl got up and danced in the moonlight, just completely filled the -- I think she had about five or six curtain calls after her Strauss piece, but she wanted the last success and then we played that symphony and it was done rally beautifully.</span> <span id="s2567">It was the most poetic concert that I remember.</span> <span id="s2568">I had twelve curtain calls.</span> <span id="s2569">I mean, they just didn't stop.</span> <span id="s2570">And Lily said I must say, she has got it, about me, because she could tell.</span> <span id="s2571">There were a dozen friends of mine that I made at the time that I lived at the beach and of course these friends are the ones that wanted, why can't we have an orchestra, so we had a meeting of the music lovers of the area, which are very few.</span> <span id="s2572">There was a doctor, and some women friends, a nurse, and a pianist, students of mine that had come out and saw that and they arranged an evening and one of my students was a little boy --.</span></p> <p><span id="s2573">Tape #12</span></p> <p><span id="s2574">A: So, after the concert, everyone said, why can't we have something like that in Orange County, because this was beyond Orange County.</span> <span id="s2575">This was inland.</span> <span id="s2576">And so, I said I don't know why we couldn't have that.</span> <span id="s2577">And so, the people that were at the concert were friends of mine and acquaintances, parents of my students that I have built up very slowly because nobody played music in Orange County.</span> <span id="s2578">It was a barren cultural territory.</span> <span id="s2579">I said, we have to get together and talk about it.</span> <span id="s2580">So, what we did, this doctor, his name was Furman, he had a gathering where they listened to recordings.</span> <span id="s2581">That's all they could do and that group came together and I said, I'll give you chamber music concert.</span> <span id="s2582">I will ask some people from the orchestra and I will play the cello and we will just give you a concert and maybe we can get some other interested people together and come to this home music here and I will give a talk and we can start something.</span> <span id="s2583">And that's what we did.</span> <span id="s2584">We had a concert at Dr. Furman's house and I had my one legged clarinet player and we played a clarinet quintet and there were some string players, and then I explained that I had a volunteer orchestra and we could of course we could give a concert and they asked well what would the concert cost you and I said everybody got $30 and I did it for free so we had $1,500 to work with.</span> <span id="s2585">So, they said, "That's all?"</span> <span id="s2586">And I said, "Yes, that's all for now."</span> <span id="s2587">So, they did get the money together.</span></p> <p><span id="s2588">They got a little committee together and they told me to hire, to rent an auditorium and I rent an auditorium in Santa Anna, which was the best auditorium we could get and I went on the phone and called up and said we would like a Saturday evening and she said you're picking the only Saturday we have left on the schedule.</span> <span id="s2589">We got our concert and we did it in Santa Anna and that started the Orange County Philharmonic of which I am still the only live member.</span> <span id="s2590">The story is unbelievable because they have gotten themselves, it is such a crime really, and they have kind of eased themselves out of existence by their own attitude.</span> <span id="s2591">What they did is I started everything that they never had.</span> <span id="s2592">I started youth concerts.</span> <span id="s2593">I started school concerts which I had done in Europe.</span> <span id="s2594">It's not my first part of my career, but I had to recreate.</span> <span id="s2595">They had nothing, absolutely nothing.</span> <span id="s2596">But each school had an auditorium so I could give concerts in all the small towns, and it grew fabulously.</span> <span id="s2597">Everybody wanted to be in the Orange County Philharmonic, and I was the musical director and I got a contact, and the same man who was my first president of the board was the same father of one of my students who gave the first $100 towards the $1,500 that started it.</span> <span id="s2598">His name was Dick Richard.</span> <span id="s2599">He climbed up from my simple grocery clerk to one of the most successful businessmen around.</span> <span id="s2600">He was the one who threw the first $100 on the table to begin this.</span> <span id="s2601">He became our first president and everything went just fabulously.</span> <span id="s2602">But the people are so completely uncultured, that it was very very hard to educate them, musically, I mean.</span> <span id="s2603">They were rich, there's a lot of money there, so everybody wanted to be in on this event and they made committees.</span> <span id="s2604">Every little town, Anaheim, Santa Anna, Newport Bridge, Little Inland Garden Grove, everybody had a committee, and I had an army of women working to start committees.</span> <span id="s2605">One calendar year, I gave 75 speeches to promote music.</span> <span id="s2606">I was the musical director.</span> <span id="s2607">I had the full say of programs.</span> <span id="s2608">I had to do this, and they finally gave me a contract for five years.</span> <span id="s2609">I had the orchestra for eight years, but after three years, I got this contract.</span> <span id="s2610">And everything went just fabulous.</span> <span id="s2611">More social every year, more socialites, more money, more fashion shows, more committee members.</span> <span id="s2612">At a certain point, I had 500 official committee members.</span> <span id="s2613">Ten committees of a maximum of 50 people were filled so I had to shake hands all the time when I came for a speech and it became a lot of work.</span> <span id="s2614">It was successful.</span> <span id="s2615">I had to repeat four times because they couldn't take all the kids that wanted to come.</span> <span id="s2616">I mean, it was really, I have stacks of good press and then my contract of five years was up in 1960 and I had that contract but there were more and more feelings of wanting something more spectacular that they brought in some international orchestras and then my contract came up for renewal and they didn't want it.</span> <span id="s2617">Not only that, they wanted to have only imported orchestras, the Berlin Philharmonic.</span> <span id="s2618">I had some very good friends and one time one of my friends wanted to make a telephone call because I didn't get my contract renewed, because she was for me, and she wanted to call an influential person, I think it was who lived at, who was a friend of mine and she called and I heard her say, why she called and suddenly her face changed and was quite white and she said "Oh, I didn't know."</span> <span id="s2619">That was all, because I was sitting right there and I knew it was something that she didn't want to repeat or go into conversation.</span> <span id="s2620">So, I have a feeling that it was the gossip about my lifestyle because there was no other reason.</span> <span id="s2621">It was successful and to go to 500 committee women that couldn't even fill 1,000 seat hall that had become so socialite, the poor people that could come originally to concerts, that were affordable or free had left the scene.</span> <span id="s2622">It was all social.</span> <span id="s2623">One time I was ready to give a speech, and I was going to the home where I was expected to talk to the people about the music for children an the music for the schools and music is valuable.</span> <span id="s2624">I always had these talks that out of 75 that I gave that year, it was always about how good music is.</span> <span id="s2625">I wanted to tell how I knew that it was deteriorating, the reason and going into this home where I had to appear, there was a car stopping behind me and two old ladies and I said, "Can I help you maybe?"</span> <span id="s2626">And she said, "Would you tell us where the benefit is for Harry Belinfante?"</span> <span id="s2627">I said, "I think you need to go to that house, but I'll tell you something, Harry doesn't need the benefit."</span> <span id="s2628">Which just tells you what the lay of the land had become.</span> <span id="s2629">They didn't know me from Adam.</span> <span id="s2630">They didn't know there was anybody by the name of Belinfante.</span></p> <p><span id="s2631">Q: You said that you think your contract was not renewed --?</span> <span id="s2632">A: I'm convinced of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2633">Q: But can you explain it a little bit more?</span></p> <p><span id="s2634">A: Well, because I think these people have heard probably heard -- first of all I have to say I had the misfortune that a lot of times people fall in love with me that I'd have no use for and make a nuisance of themselves.</span> <span id="s2635">And they blamed it on me if I had affairs with them and if I don't.</span> <span id="s2636">The women were always available, too much.</span> <span id="s2637">I remember some of the women it was hard to get them out of my car.</span> <span id="s2638">They would sit and talk to me and keep me up after a concert and I was not going to attack them, I was not going to do anything.</span> <span id="s2639">I knew what they were waiting for, but I knew what they were waiting for and what they were trying to get me to do, but I still remember me sitting in the car with them, sometimes with a woman until 2:00 in the morning after a concert or something.</span> <span id="s2640">So, I knew what they were trying to do, whether they wanted to find proof or whether they wanted to compromise I don't know, but I'm pretty sure that was what was said on the phone.</span></p> <p><span id="s2641">Q: Did you have relationships in Orange with other women?</span> <span id="s2642">Did you live together with someone in Orange County?</span></p> <p><span id="s2643">A: Yes, several relationships, but some that were nothing.</span> <span id="s2644">I lived together with people that I didn't have relationships with.</span> <span id="s2645">Not any more, but I certainly wasn't very open about it that I threw it at them.</span> <span id="s2646">I wasn't doing anything that they could say "Well, she's leading a wild life" or something.</span> <span id="s2647">I was just behaving like everybody else, because I knew that would be bad to accentuate.</span></p> <p><span id="s2648">Q: Was there a difference in the moral climate in the Netherlands in the 30s and then when you came to the States, did you have to change your life to be more careful?</span></p> <p><span id="s2649">A: I have never been more careful.</span> <span id="s2650">I just consider lifestyles, it's not because I'm secretive about it, because I have shared my home with several people and I have been open to the people that have approached me, the male people that approached me.</span> <span id="s2651">I have been open and have said, no, I'm not available because I really cannot love a man as much as I can love a woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s2652">But I've always been approached by the women.</span> <span id="s2653">I never had to go after anyone because they were always after me.</span> <span id="s2654">I was plagued with it in Orange County.</span> <span id="s2655">I would come home one time and at 10:00 there was somebody standing on the sand looking at the ocean and I knew she was waiting for me to come home and catch me by myself and I said I don't know what you're doing here.</span> <span id="s2656">These people I didn't ask for.</span> <span id="s2657">I wasn't after people.</span> <span id="s2658">They were after me, all the time.</span> <span id="s2659">But then of course when I didn't follow through, then they became nasty.</span></p> <p><span id="s2660">And I think that's what happened, just jealously among the women.</span> <span id="s2661">There were more than one.</span> <span id="s2662">I didn't have an affair with more than one, it was just they kept acting , so I knew it was several people that were in love with me, but and I knew why the women was sitting in the car until 2:00.</span> <span id="s2663">Then, I never responded to that silent request.</span> <span id="s2664">She turned absolutely 100 percent.</span></p> <p><span id="s2665">Q: Were there any other female conductors in the States?</span></p> <p><span id="s2666">A: No, not that I know of.</span> <span id="s2667">Not in Holland either, not in '39, '38 when I was the only woman who had a professional orchestra.</span> <span id="s2668">I didn't ever have an all women orchestra.</span> <span id="s2669">I had an all professional orchestra both times.</span></p> <p><span id="s2670">Q: So, you are the first female conductor?</span></p> <p><span id="s2671">A: Yes, I think so.</span> <span id="s2672">There are several now.</span> <span id="s2673">There is a woman by the name of Tamarkin (ph) who has been a guest conductor in Orange County, too.</span> <span id="s2674">She has a job in the mid-west.</span> <span id="s2675">She even took some lessons from me before she had the job as a conductor.</span> <span id="s2676">But I don't think anybody still can get a job in the public eye, any conductor who is gay or lesbian openly.</span> <span id="s2677">I think they always have to kind of not talk about it.</span> <span id="s2678">If they are very great, they can get away with it.</span> <span id="s2679">But we have several.</span> <span id="s2680">We have the evidence of very famous conductors being homosexual.</span> <span id="s2681">Not all of them are, and many artists are.</span> <span id="s2682">But when they need the public, when they need to be hired, I don't think they can afford -- I think they don't.</span> <span id="s2683">I still think they don't.</span> <span id="s2684">And it's not for me to mention any names.</span> <span id="s2685">I always say what I said in the camp, in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s2686">How do you know I am homosexual?</span> <span id="s2687">Were you there.</span> <span id="s2688">Did you see any homosexual act performed by me?</span> <span id="s2689">You were present then how do you know what you're talking about?</span> <span id="s2690">They were ashamed, because I really took them to task, I said, these are not things that you can tell for sure.</span> <span id="s2691">You guess maybe.</span> <span id="s2692">Well, do you know what I guess about you, think about you, not just sexually but in general?</span> <span id="s2693">Would you like me to tell you what I think about you in public.</span> <span id="s2694">People are dealing with it the wrong way.</span> <span id="s2695">They shouldn't even want to know.</span> <span id="s2696">It is a private affair.</span> <span id="s2697">That is why it goes on without an audience.</span> <span id="s2698">I don't make love or haven't made love publicly.</span> <span id="s2699">I conduct publicly.</span> <span id="s2700">I play publicly.</span> <span id="s2701">That is for the public.</span> <span id="s2702">That is not for the public to tell what happens in the bedroom.</span> <span id="s2703">It's not important.</span></p> <p><span id="s2704">And you don't do anything to a whole community.</span> <span id="s2705">You do something to a community when you take their music or you bring them music.</span> <span id="s2706">Right now at the University of California is a professor with which whom I got started with research about what happened to the brain when you listen to classical music and they find out that the brain is working much better even in unborn babies and in college students, and I got him started on that.</span> <span id="s2707">His name is Gordon Shaw, and I think that is important.</span> <span id="s2708">Research what happens when you listen to good music.</span> <span id="s2709">That is what I have tried to do all my life, to give music to people and good music.</span></p> <p><span id="s2710">Rock and Roll doesn't do it, Jazz doesn't even do it, but classical music is what they are using for babies and up to college students, but even babies perform better right after they have listened to a piece of music and solve a puzzle after listening to the music.</span> <span id="s2711">They do it three times faster.</span> <span id="s2712">That is a startling discovery, what music does for these people.</span> <span id="s2713">That is what my life has been busy with, with bringing music to people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2714">Q: Did you get throughout your musical career, in Amsterdam when you were the first female conductor and then in Orange County, did you get a lot of reactions to the fact that you were the first woman who was conducting an orchestra?</span></p> <p><span id="s2715">A: No, I don't think so, and I really didn't pursue that because I don't think there is an essential difference whether you are a woman or a man.</span> <span id="s2716">I think it is what you do with your life, what you do with your work, what you have servicing.</span> <span id="s2717">I think so many people who don't think they are there for a purpose.</span> <span id="s2718">They want to live and take.</span> <span id="s2719">We have to live and give and we have to give in the first place, love for each other and fill the need for somebody else.</span> <span id="s2720">We have to do something for each other.</span> <span id="s2721">If you only live for what you want for yourself, you're not worth living.</span></p> <p><span id="s2722">Q: But in the public eye a conductor I still even today it is a man not a woman, did you always have to find this image?</span></p> <p><span id="s2723">A: No, it came my way pretty easily.</span> <span id="s2724">That's why I'm saying I was just helping another conductor out, I was playing first cello when this other studio musician said are you a relative of the Belinfante woman?</span> <span id="s2725">I said, "No, that's no relative conductor.</span> <span id="s2726">They must mean me."</span> <span id="s2727">And that's how it started in the United States.</span> <span id="s2728">I wouldn't have said, "Here I am, I am a conductor, where is my orchestra."</span> <span id="s2729">I knew it had to happen or not happen, but it did happen.</span> <span id="s2730">And things are always happened and always happened to me.</span> <span id="s2731">And it has never hurt my feelings when people gossip about me or anything like that because it's their loss that they don't know any better.</span> <span id="s2732">It's not my loss.</span> <span id="s2733">I'm perfectly satisfied.</span></p> <p><span id="s2734">Q: Did you go back to Amsterdam?</span></p> <p><span id="s2735">A: A couple of times to see my mother and a couple of times to take a trip.</span> <span id="s2736">I took two trips to see .</span> <span id="s2737">The second time he asked me to come, the first one I came because I was there and I wanted to see him.</span> <span id="s2738">The second time he wrote me a letter and I knew that he was feeling bad and he thought he wouldn't live very long.</span></p> <p><span id="s2739">Tape #13</span></p> <p><span id="s2740">Q: Did you think when you were living in the States and working here, did you think a lot back where you came from about the years of Resistance, or was that something that you didn't think so much and talk so much?</span></p> <p><span id="s2741">A: No, I did not think too much about the past.</span> <span id="s2742">I'm usually thinking about what I want to do with my life, and I always felt that there are levels of excitement.</span> <span id="s2743">There are levels on which you can classify the period that you're talking about.</span> <span id="s2744">It was very exciting to be doing dangerous things.</span> <span id="s2745">To try to save your life and still do what you wanted to do.</span> <span id="s2746">I mean I have a strong element I think of being attracted by danger and make it.</span> <span id="s2747">I mean, the satisfaction of being able to face a danger and get what I want.</span> <span id="s2748">I used to have one time handwriting analysis of someone who had never seen me and it was write on the dot.</span> <span id="s2749">The handwriting analysis was just exactly what I think I am.</span> <span id="s2750">But one of the things she had written was direct dangers attract you.</span> <span id="s2751">And that is so true, because I had a satisfaction to illegal work for a good purpose.</span> <span id="s2752">That was my justification to do it.</span> <span id="s2753">I didn't do something dangerous without purpose, but I did do something that needed to be done, and I was right there to do it.</span> <span id="s2754">That is what I mean.</span> <span id="s2755">I did it when I did it illegally for my friend Ellen Schwartz.</span> <span id="s2756">I thought the law was wrong.</span> <span id="s2757">The Dutch government made the wrong decision to not give a person her papers because she was originally Russian.</span> <span id="s2758">So, I took the law into my hand and changed it.</span> <span id="s2759">I did that because I thought it was the wrong thing, the government.</span> <span id="s2760">So, I made my own -- and create, of course, a danger for myself.</span> <span id="s2761">I was always on the edge, but I liked that attraction.</span></p> <p><span id="s2762">However, music contains everything, it's sublime.</span> <span id="s2763">Excitement in music is not illegal, it is not destructive.</span> <span id="s2764">It's lifted to another level, but it is exciting.</span> <span id="s2765">And all the good feelings that one can have of love and joy and even of defeat, death, I know there is a composition of somebody who was thought to be dead and was thrown on the heap of the corpses and woke up, came to life again.</span> <span id="s2766">There is music written on that event.</span> <span id="s2767">It is not music I want to listen to.</span> <span id="s2768">I have heard it once.</span> <span id="s2769">In other words, everything can be expressed in music.</span> <span id="s2770">The bad, the frightening, the good, the loving.</span> <span id="s2771">Music can express almost anything, because it's us.</span> <span id="s2772">We make it.</span> <span id="s2773">We compose it or we play it, and it is on a higher level than life without.</span> <span id="s2774">There is something in music that does an awful lot to people that they don't even know because those people don't know that they are researching them in the university.</span> <span id="s2775">They are still in the beginning of this research that I won't know when they are done what they've come up with, not consciously anyway.</span> <span id="s2776">But I'm very, very interested as long as I can read what they're doing, which I do.</span> <span id="s2777">One of the professors has been here three times to tell me what they are.</span> <span id="s2778">It's very important to me that they do that.</span> <span id="s2779">I think that the human race has to find out a lot about themselves and correct about themselves, because I don't think they are in the right direction.</span> <span id="s2780">That's my worry.</span></p> <p><span id="s2781">Q: You say you concentrate more on what you can do with your life.</span> <span id="s2782">You concentrate more on what you do with your live, but how much do you think about your life in the Netherlands?</span></p> <p><span id="s2783">A: Well, I did devote my life to music and I did start the music education already in Holland.</span> <span id="s2784">I gave school concerts there too.</span> <span id="s2785">But there was much more activity in the musical field in Amsterdam than there was when I came to the United States.</span> <span id="s2786">The United States is a younger civilization.</span> <span id="s2787">Holland is an older civilization.</span> <span id="s2788">There has been music in the families in the homes.</span> <span id="s2789">People have music lessons.</span> <span id="s2790">It was way ahead.</span> <span id="s2791">In America you had music much later, because they had to first I would say to make a living and pioneering in other fields.</span></p> <p><span id="s2792">But I pioneered in music.</span> <span id="s2793">I liked that, to bring music where it wasn't.</span> <span id="s2794">I didn't get in the right place really because I think I would have done better maybe in the midwest, but I wouldn't have liked to be there.</span> <span id="s2795">I mean, it's no use to cry over spilled milk.</span> <span id="s2796">I may have and I may not have, but what I think is most important is to make people see how I think.</span> <span id="s2797">Because I think they miss the purpose of life, some people do.</span> <span id="s2798">They think there is no purpose or to try to get rich is the purpose or try to get famous is the purpose.</span> <span id="s2799">It's not.</span> <span id="s2800">I don't care.</span> <span id="s2801">I care about other things.</span> <span id="s2802">I care mostly that the people understood what I tried to give them.</span> <span id="s2803">And they do, lots of my friends and students tell me that I do.</span> <span id="s2804">They know what I did.</span> <span id="s2805">They say I make it easy for them to do certain things that they otherwise wouldn't have thought of doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2806">Q: We talked before that as long as you worked you were very busy and you didn't think so very much back about your resistance.</span></p> <p><span id="s2807">A: No, I am reflecting a lot more about my life since I have nothing else to do.</span> <span id="s2808">Because I can't play anymore, I can't hear music and enjoy any more.</span> <span id="s2809">I can't see very well.</span> <span id="s2810">I can't physically do very much, so I'm very limited.</span> <span id="s2811">My hearing is bad, my eyes are bad, so my senses don't work very well.</span> <span id="s2812">The only thing that I can do is think straight.</span> <span id="s2813">I mean, I always say I'm glad I have my marbles, because I wouldn't care about life if I couldn't think.</span> <span id="s2814">If I couldn't tell you when you ask me a question, but I'm glad I can, and I tried to be here to tell you what you want to know.</span> <span id="s2815">So you ask me anything you want.</span></p> <p><span id="s2816">Q: What changed exactly when you stopped working and you seemed to have much more interest to know more about the Resistance?</span></p> <p><span id="s2817">A: I think back, I look back on my life to see what I have done, what I could have done, whether I did some things that I shouldn't have done.</span> <span id="s2818">What I should have said to people, I try to say things in the right place where they belong, and I tried to formulate if I had some children, which I don't, some students, which I don't, I cannot.</span> <span id="s2819">But what I left out what I could maybe tell you or write, and I'm thinking about life and I'm reflecting and I think I've done most of the teaching the way I wanted to do it, because my students keep coming back and telling me.</span> <span id="s2820">They're coming here and telling me.</span> <span id="s2821">And even this professor I'm talking to you about, who is doing this research work on the brain reaction to music, he told me just recently that I had changed his life, because I had told him about coping with life and coping with knowing that I'm going to die soon.</span> <span id="s2822">I said I'm not afraid to die.</span> <span id="s2823">And I told him why, because how I feel about that.</span> <span id="s2824">It's not an end, because it's all belonging together.</span> <span id="s2825">I mean everything else that I can see and feel and hear and can communicate with is always there.</span> <span id="s2826">It's there, it will be there when I'm gone, but I don't know what happens after, because we are so limited.</span> <span id="s2827">We only know we have five senses which is not enough to encompass what is beyond five senses.</span> <span id="s2828">We talk about light years, but we can't conceive about light years.</span> <span id="s2829">In other words, we talk about a lot of things that we don't comprehend that we really don't experience.</span> <span id="s2830">We have some funny, I would say talent or way of putting in words, things that we really don't experience or comprehend.</span> <span id="s2831">We are talk about light years, don't we, and black holes.</span> <span id="s2832">You read it in the paper and you've think you've learned something, but you've not learned anything.</span> <span id="s2833">I think we're going out too far in our talks that we think we know and forget what's right here and what we should be interested in doing.</span> <span id="s2834">I think as humans we should try to be a nice human being first.</span></p> <p><span id="s2835">Q: You have been very sick and you have had treatment for cancer and how did that change you?</span> <span id="s2836">How did you deal with this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2837">A: Well, when you get medicine, you are not the same person.</span> <span id="s2838">I mean, medicine, an artificial means to deal with illness, is not the strongest way to deal with it.</span> <span id="s2839">But I feel that I am dealing much more efficiently with my physical situation and I get more so as I get older.</span> <span id="s2840">I told you the doctor doesn't know how I do it.</span> <span id="s2841">The last time I saw him he said your bad counts in your blood are down.</span> <span id="s2842">He said, "I don't know how you do it.</span> <span id="s2843">Maybe we can learn something from you."</span> <span id="s2844">That was the last time I saw him.</span> <span id="s2845">He didn't even examine me.</span> <span id="s2846">He didn't give me an medicine, but I wanted to be here to get this film done and to get the things said that I wanted to say to people.</span> <span id="s2847">I wanted to say what I think, not keep it to myself, because I was not teaching any more.</span> <span id="s2848">I was just sharing my philosophy.</span> <span id="s2849">So, I started thinking more about my life of course when I didn't have to think about other people's lives and other people's skill in playing music.</span> <span id="s2850">But I seem to give them the feeling sometimes without even knowing I do that.</span> <span id="s2851">I don't know.</span> <span id="s2852">I think there is a lot of unspoken language between human beings that are used and I don't even know how I use it, but I think I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s2853">People remember what I said, sometimes much longer that I remember it myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s2854">Q: Did you have treatment for your cancer?</span></p> <p><span id="s2855">A: Oh, yes, I had all the treatment that the body is supposed to be able to take, of chemotherapy, which amounts of fluid getting in my veins and I got feeling pretty bad.</span> <span id="s2856">I never got sick to my stomach and I have never vomited in my life that I remember, never.</span> <span id="s2857">Some people do get physically sick in the stomach, but I was not able to do very much.</span> <span id="s2858">Also, I didn't have any desire to talk about things like I have desire now.</span> <span id="s2859">I like to talk to people and that's when I started to talk to people about my life a little bit and they would always ask me, tell me more, because they liked to hear the stories.</span> <span id="s2860">Because some are very different in character than -- it's not just a story of danger.</span> <span id="s2861">It's just not a story of my walking 12 hours but how I got the strength to do it.</span> <span id="s2862">How I made it against all odds, nobody thought that I could do that at that point.</span> <span id="s2863">And how things fell into place has always surprised me.</span> <span id="s2864">It was always right there, when it was needed I would say in the flow of my own life.</span> <span id="s2865">I mean, why was the sister of the girl that bought the Crosley and left me with the Crosley why two days before I went to the United States I hadn't seen her for years.</span> <span id="s2866">The older sister of my school friend, Mimi, goes past me in the radio studio on a visiting tour.</span> <span id="s2867">She wasn't even a musician.</span> <span id="s2868">I never saw her for years, and she walks by me and I said "Mees," and she said, "Frieda" and I said I have no time I have to go to another studio, but I'm going to the country of United States, tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, either one.</span> <span id="s2869">And she said, "Well, but that's where Minnie lives.</span> <span id="s2870">She lives in New York."</span> <span id="s2871">And she writes and puts it in my pocket.</span> <span id="s2872">That's the woman with whom I go cross country and buys a Crosley automobile.</span> <span id="s2873">Why is it that I meet that woman right there.</span> <span id="s2874">It has always been startling how in my life these things just happen.</span> <span id="s2875">Somebody says go and see that woman in Long Beach.</span> <span id="s2876">She's a wonderful music critic and she tells me there is a camp and go to it anyway.</span> <span id="s2877">And I take -- I always feel like I am a little straw that just floats and listens to some suggestions and sometimes I get stuck and nothing happens.</span> <span id="s2878">So, I got stuck, but the wind will take me again, which is life, and it will take me on again, and I float and something comes my way.</span> <span id="s2879">I do anything.</span> <span id="s2880">I don't make up my mind to become a musician.</span> <span id="s2881">I become a musician because I got a cello and I love the sound of the cello.</span> <span id="s2882">If I had gotten a violin, I probably would have never become a musician.</span> <span id="s2883">I become a conductor because they take me from the high school and my friend Hans who taken first because he's a man and probably a man can handle those brats in a high school better than a woman, but I get the job after a year because he can't deal with, and I can't deal with it.</span> <span id="s2884">I mean I get pushed from here to there.</span> <span id="s2885">I get pushed from last month, I get a letter from Tony and I think I want to speak out.</span> <span id="s2886">I want to tell my story and I tell stories to other people too.</span> <span id="s2887">But it is always there.</span> <span id="s2888">It comes and sometimes I know the next step was for a reason, but I find out a reasons sometimes later.</span> <span id="s2889">But I don't make plans and I never made plans for my career or for my future in the United States, for an orchestra, it happened.</span> <span id="s2890">Why don't you conduct, why don't you do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2891">Q: Can you tell us again what the doctors said about your cancer and why they were so startled about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2892">A: Because, see I know my body even.</span> <span id="s2893">I went to teach the last three years that we live here.</span> <span id="s2894">I went back once a month to teach my students five days and then I'm back here because our home was sold.</span> <span id="s2895">We shared our home for about ten years, the Minkin family and I, because my home became too big, so I sold it and I built a little studio onto their place.</span> <span id="s2896">I did that while I was still healthy.</span> <span id="s2897">So, I got a cancer in the '80s.</span> <span id="s2898">I also got other illnesses in the '80s, but the last time I had a lymphoma in the '80s, just when the plan came to move to New Mexico, I felt that I had cancer.</span> <span id="s2899">And I felt that I had cancer because I couldn't swallow sometimes.</span> <span id="s2900">And my nephew, who I had taken to the United States because he was a severe asthma patient in Holland, when he was 20, he was 50 years old at that time, and he had the same trouble, and he couldn't swallow.</span> <span id="s2901">One of the trips that I made to Orange County to teach, because I thought I had cancer and I didn't tell the Minkins that I didn't feel good, I thought let's first move and then the first month that I went back by myself to teach I asked one of my students to drop me off at a doctor I knew, a friend of Dick's.</span> <span id="s2902">I said, would you take me to the doctor, and she did.</span> <span id="s2903">I asked him, I said, Shelly would you take a biopsy and look in my stomach and see what you find.</span> <span id="s2904">And sure enough, he found another cancer.</span></p> <p><span id="s2905">Then I asked him to get in touch with the oncologist here and they conferred about it and they were in agreement.</span> <span id="s2906">They told me that it was a very nasty cancer.</span> <span id="s2907">One cancer always eliminates another.</span> <span id="s2908">You can't have two different cancers at the same time.</span> <span id="s2909">So, I didn't have the chance to get a lymphoma back, but he said it was a much more vicious cancer.</span> <span id="s2910">So, it didn't look very good, and my nephew had also esophagus cancer, but he also had a big stomach tumor and he died that January after that time.</span> <span id="s2911">That was two years ago.</span> <span id="s2912">And I got treatments and I fought them, my kind of fight that I do, that's ignoring and not worrying about pain, just follow the program.</span> <span id="s2913">But I know my body usually better than doctors and that's why I am surprised that I am still here, and when I come in the last time, he sees me about every six or eight weeks, but he has no medicine for me because I have had the chemotherapy and then I have had radiation and the radiation burned a piece in my lung so I take a little oxygen when I'm tired and there's no more medicine they can give.</span> <span id="s2914">That's it.</span> <span id="s2915">So, he send me home and said I'll see you in six weeks, and they didn't know what to do with me because in three months there was not much change.</span> <span id="s2916">One time he said the bad markings are 20 points less than the last time I saw you.</span> <span id="s2917">So, he went to the hospice to which he is the director and talked to all the nurses and they discussed it and they didn't know should I be treated by the hospital or should I go home and wait and see.</span> <span id="s2918">So, I said, "I'm fired from the hospice" and they laughed because they don't do anything for me.</span> <span id="s2919">There is no medicine for me to take.</span> <span id="s2920">I don't take even vitamins.</span> <span id="s2921">I don't take aspirins.</span> <span id="s2922">I just get up in the morning and do what I can and I was very happy that you came and that there was something for me to do that I don't want to leave undone and that is so I keep myself going so to speak.</span></p> <p><span id="s2923">Q: How old are you now?</span></p> <p><span id="s2924">A: Ninety.</span> <span id="s2925">I turned ninety, my birthday has a funny memories because it's May 10.</span> <span id="s2926">May 10th is when the Germans walked into Holland, so I don't like that day too much.</span> <span id="s2927">I mean the memories of that date, but I like that I can do what I am doing right now and that is try to talk sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s2928">Tape #14</span></p> <p><span id="s2929">Q: If you look back, Frieda, on your life, who are the persons that you remember most, and who are the persons you feel most close to in your memory?</span></p> <p><span id="s2930">A: It's mostly because of the first half of my life for many reasons.</span> <span id="s2931">The strongest of the first adult period of my life was a composer, the one where I come in and whose liaison put the medicine on the mantlepiece and left the room.</span> <span id="s2932">The first one I really said in my life that I'm here because I love you.</span> <span id="s2933">And I loved her for a long time, many many years.</span> <span id="s2934">We lived together and the one who called me Mommy and Pop which I represented her father who she never had met because he died when she was a baby, and she had a very possessive mother and she was the only child of the family.</span> <span id="s2935">So, she needed somebody.</span> <span id="s2936">She was a lonesome person.</span> <span id="s2937">And she remained a lonesome person because she was not a giving person.</span> <span id="s2938">She was a person who took more than she gave which was fine with me because I had an abundance of devotion to give.</span> <span id="s2939">I didn't feel that I needed somebody to love me as much as I felt the need to love somebody in a different way than you do as a child.</span> <span id="s2940">I didn't have a great attachment for any member of the family, except for my aunt, who I saw every week and we played music, and I always loved her very much.</span> <span id="s2941">She was very close to the family but in a very different way of course.</span> <span id="s2942">But I protected Yetty from a lot of things, from herself.</span> <span id="s2943">I did everything for her.</span> <span id="s2944">We lived together.</span> <span id="s2945">I didn't think of my own self as a musical talent and that took Joe Falcon to get me out of that grip that I didn't think of myself as a valuable musician.</span> <span id="s2946">Because Yetty had an easy talent.</span> <span id="s2947">Yetty was the one I said I love you and I devoted my life to her.</span> <span id="s2948">And the older I became the more I was the adult and she was the child.</span> <span id="s2949">I was a child the day that I said to her "I'll take care of you."</span> <span id="s2950">And she said "Why did you stay", remember, because I said "I love you."</span> <span id="s2951">That came so spontaneous but it came from so deep.</span> <span id="s2952">That was really my first real love.</span> <span id="s2953">And I admired her and I was devoted to her and I didn't even ask for a devotion.</span> <span id="s2954">I was so filled with the feeling of giving of myself and so I felt she needed protection from her bossy mother who always wanted to know where she went and why and one time she wasn't home at night and she came with her umbrella and stomped the floor and said "I want to know where my daughter was last night."</span> <span id="s2955">And I thought, this is ridiculous.</span> <span id="s2956">She's in her twenties.</span> <span id="s2957">She need protection.</span> <span id="s2958">And I felt to protect, and I became the protector and then it developed more that I was everything.</span> <span id="s2959">I was Mommy and Pops, which means father and mother.</span> <span id="s2960">I did everything I could to protect her from her bossy mother and give her a little bit more freedom.</span> <span id="s2961">And I teased her mother with it.</span> <span id="s2962">I, for instance, one time told her mother that she couldn't stay after dinner she had to leave, we would have Sunday dinner with her mother because she wanted to see her Henrietta once a week at least for dinner.</span> <span id="s2963">And when we lived, Yetty and I lived together then we had to have dinner on Sunday with Ma and one time I said Yetty has to leave early and she said, "Why?"</span> <span id="s2964">And I said, "Oh there is a meeting that she has to lead", without making it up.</span> <span id="s2965">"What kind of a meeting?"</span> <span id="s2966">I said, "Oh, for mother's that have only children too protective, and she's the president."</span> <span id="s2967">By that time Yetty was already gone and then her mother caught on that I was teasing her.</span> <span id="s2968">But I always did something silly like that.</span> <span id="s2969">In the meantime she had taken off and I always helped her against too possessive mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s2970">And we had really funny word fights her mother and I because she would always criticize us.</span> <span id="s2971">Who cleans your house?</span> <span id="s2972">It's probably dirty, or something.</span> <span id="s2973">I said, "Oh, no we know what to do."</span> <span id="s2974">"What do you do?"</span> <span id="s2975">And I would say something silly like I take a pail with soapy water and throw it over the rug and brush it to the sides and she knew I was teasing her and she wouldn't bug me anymore.</span> <span id="s2976">She liked me but in a way she put up with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2977">Q: Here's a photo of you and Henrietta at the beach?</span> <span id="s2978">A: At the beach in .</span></p> <p><span id="s2979">Q: When was that, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s2980">A: Yes, that was in the good old times.</span> <span id="s2981">We lived together for seven years or something.</span> <span id="s2982">She always had those loose clothes.</span> <span id="s2983">She would go places with me usually to be away for vacation.</span> <span id="s2984">This was a vacation.</span> <span id="s2985">We took vacations and we traveled together a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s2986">Q: Do you remember the day the photo was taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s2987">A: No, those things are very vague in my memory.</span> <span id="s2988">When I see the picture I see beautiful pictures that were taken when she was composing and I know how we remember conversations like for instance she promoted my feeling of not being such an important musician by her attitude.</span> <span id="s2989">For instance, she had a very easy talent, as I say, and she didn't have to practice hours and hours and I felt I did.</span> <span id="s2990">We had our rooms on different floors.</span> <span id="s2991">I had my upstairs and I heard her downstairs and practice maybe an hour and a half and then she would come up and she would say "Aren't you done yet?"</span> <span id="s2992">And I would say, "Well, no."</span> <span id="s2993">And she said if you went on an hour and a half, you'll never learn it.</span> <span id="s2994">So I felt very little of my talent because I had difficulty with my fingers.</span> <span id="s2995">I mean she had long fingers and very good hands for the piano and she had an easy talent.</span> <span id="s2996">Sometimes I got back at her and said, "Do you know that you play all the trills louder than the rest of the notes?"</span> <span id="s2997">She said, "What do you mean."</span> <span id="s2998">I said, "Well, I can hear it, because I'm upstairs and I can hear.</span> <span id="s2999">I can hear only the trills and the notes in between I don't hear so you must be playing the trills" and then she took my criticism.</span> <span id="s3000">That was the only time that she did because she would always put my talent a little bit down, not in a nasty way, but that was her opinion.</span> <span id="s3001">If you didn't learn it in an hour and half, because she did.</span> <span id="s3002">She never practices for hours and hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s3003">Q: Look at the photo and then slowly just hold it and look at me.</span></p> <p><span id="s3004">A: All that early time of my friendship with Yetty , we got to know other people and we made friends, and we had a little chamber music group that was going to give concerts.</span> <span id="s3005">We rehearsed every week.</span> <span id="s3006">We got together and we met other musicians.</span> <span id="s3007">I met other musicians and then there were two particular friends that we would go after rehearsal and have something to drink, go to American Hotel because we had our rehearsal right close on the , and we went with the flute player John Falcon, who was my husband later, and who was very fond of Yetty, and so we were kind of coupled off that way.</span> <span id="s3008">I would talk with Falcon and Yetty would talk more with Peter because he was always -- and there were sometimes other people with us like Paul Saunders who was also conducting, so was .</span> <span id="s3009">Falcon was more or less my partner when we went out for a drink or something.</span> <span id="s3010">One time he said, "I never have a chance to see much of you" and I said, "well, because you don't try.</span> <span id="s3011">We only see each other at the rehearsal.</span> <span id="s3012">You never said that you wanted to see me other times."</span> <span id="s3013">So, promptly he came to visit me and I still see him sitting on the floor with his long legs stretched out on the floor and he said something to the effect that he liked to see more of me and that he liked me and I said, what is the trouble.</span> <span id="s3014">He said, "The trouble is that I am engaged."</span> <span id="s3015">I said, "Well, if you are engaged, that settles that doesn't it?"</span> <span id="s3016">He said, "Yes, that is just the trouble."</span> <span id="s3017">And I said, "Well, how come you get engaged if that's not what you want?"</span> <span id="s3018">And he said, "Well, it's really my mother's doing and my brother Hans is engaged to her sister and my mother took the two girls in the house and she liked them, and I think she hoped that I would be engaged to the sister."</span> <span id="s3019">But he said, "I'm not in love with her."</span> <span id="s3020">I said, "Well, that's a bad situation.</span> <span id="s3021">As long as you are engaged, you are engaged."</span> <span id="s3022">He said, "Well, I'm going to have to break that off."</span> <span id="s3023">I said, "If you don't love her, I think you should."</span> <span id="s3024">And that was all the conversation at that time.</span> <span id="s3025">And then our friendship was more based on the fact that he wanted me to recognize my own talent and give my own talent a chance and I played one time a coupe of months in a movie theater, where the silent movies are accompanied by a whole stack of music this thick and a little bit of this and a little bit of that and the whole program was played to get into the movie.</span> <span id="s3026">That was for hours in the dark playing these silent movies.</span> <span id="s3027">But he would pick me up to carry my cello home and so forth.</span> <span id="s3028">And he would give me a little lecture about my talent, I needed to pay attention to that.</span> <span id="s3029">That was quite a friendship.</span> <span id="s3030">Then he met, of course, Yetty, who I told you he called "Sweet" and he was a friend of the house.</span> <span id="s3031">Yetty had several love affairs with men while we lived together.</span> <span id="s3032">I mean it was not particularly a sexual bond.</span> <span id="s3033">It was more my protection of this person which I love very much who I thought was kind of smothered by her possessive mother.</span> <span id="s3034">That was much more what I tried to do.</span> <span id="s3035">So, I didn't compare notes and what do I gather but John always said to me, you don't think of your own music.</span> <span id="s3036">You don't think of your own talent, and you need to develop that.</span> <span id="s3037">And so, I got very close to him as a friend.</span> <span id="s3038">And then he told me that he had broken his engagement and that he was in love with me and that he loved me and wouldn't live without me and that built up while Yetty had her flings with artist friends.</span> <span id="s3039">People fell in love with her because of her talent and her looks.</span> <span id="s3040">I know of two musicians that she had an affair with while we lived together as friends.</span> <span id="s3041">It was more my devotion to her because of my nature of trying to protect, trying to rescue, trying to save people from whatever danger.</span> <span id="s3042">It's much more prominent in my nature than the sex life per se.</span> <span id="s3043">I wasn't jealous when she had an affair with a man.</span> <span id="s3044">She told me and I don't remember that we had really an important sexual relation.</span> <span id="s3045">That was how it started, but I don't know how long it lasted and I don't think it played a big part in my life.</span> <span id="s3046">Always what I was doing for people played a big part in my life.</span> <span id="s3047">Helping them, protect them, save them from doing this or that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3048">Q: What about the lady on the ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s3049">A: Well, the lady on the ship became my friend after I came out West.</span> <span id="s3050">I corresponded with her from New York and from Vermont and when I came cross country, I knew that my friend who bought a Crosley had to go back to her job in New York, and so I corresponded with -- her name was Ivy -- I corresponded with Ivy and I said that eventually I probably would end up on the west coast.</span></p> <p><span id="s3051">Q: Did you have a sexual relationship with her?</span></p> <p><span id="s3052">A: On board ship, once.</span> <span id="s3053">And it was very difficult because she shared a cabin with a woman and I shared my cabin with another strange woman.</span> <span id="s3054">So, we sneaked out one time, and she was very undersexed.</span> <span id="s3055">I learned that later.</span> <span id="s3056">But she liked me very much but she told me that she was going to get married with her lover and his name was Alfred and that when she got to Pasadena where she lived that Alfred would come next year.</span> <span id="s3057">And I remember that a woman who was sitting at the single table where she had invited me was a woman from Bermuda and one time she said to me "She's not going to get married.</span> <span id="s3058">He's not going to come marry her."</span> <span id="s3059">And I thought this is strange that this woman tells me.</span> <span id="s3060">But I never talked to that woman anymore, but that's what I remember that stood out in my mind.</span> <span id="s3061">Anyway, when I traveled the United States, criss crossed it, took a whole month, I did go to the East to West Coast and Minnie who owned the car said you keep the Crosly because I can't use it in New York and I will eventually quit my job and go to the west coast too, and then you can give it back to me which happened.</span> <span id="s3062">When we got to , she left me with the car and took a Greyhound bus back to New York.</span> <span id="s3063">And then I was there and stopped at the home in Pasadena which I had written to Ivy that I would do.</span> <span id="s3064">Her mother had died but she had room for me and she said it's a good thing I have room for you because you can't get an apartment anywhere.</span> <span id="s3065">There is a shortage.</span> <span id="s3066">So, I shared her home.</span></p> <p><span id="s3067">Q: Did she get married?</span> <span id="s3068">A: No, he never came.</span></p> <p><span id="s3069">Q: What about your relationships in the States when you came to California?</span></p> <p><span id="s3070">A: Well, Ivy was one, but it was a very very unsexy relationship because she was very low in her physical attraction.</span> <span id="s3071">But we lived together.</span> <span id="s3072">We shared a room together and we bought a house together in Westwood, because she saved -- she was the world's greatest saver of money.</span> <span id="s3073">She spent nothing on herself.</span> <span id="s3074">She earned a small salary.</span> <span id="s3075">She managed sort of a thrift shop.</span> <span id="s3076">When I asked her what is her profession, she said, "I'm an appraiser," because she put the prices on.</span> <span id="s3077">She was talking big because she wanted to impress me.</span> <span id="s3078">She was in her fashion, in love with me.</span> <span id="s3079">I usually have relationships with people that started to fall in love with me.</span> <span id="s3080">I didn't instigate too many.</span></p> <p><span id="s3081">Q: Did you have a long relationship with another woman while you were here in California?</span></p> <p><span id="s3082">A: While I was in the United States, one relationship was Ivy, but it was as I said, sexually, it was very low, low gear.</span> <span id="s3083">She became a little strange later when she grew older and even when we shared a home.</span> <span id="s3084">I had all these women around me that were in love with me.</span> <span id="s3085">I had students and people would say -- one said "I would like to be more than a number."</span> <span id="s3086">And I said, "What do you mean?"</span> <span id="s3087">"A number in your calendar that you teach me."</span> <span id="s3088">I mean, there was -- and very often married women.</span> <span id="s3089">Very often I had to be secretive about it because to protect them.</span> <span id="s3090">I usually wasn't secretive myself because when I fall in love with people I don't mind if they know it.</span> <span id="s3091">I don't mind telling them.</span> <span id="s3092">But it was always on the other side that I had to be careful.</span></p> <p><span id="s3093">Q: Would you tell about the married women with whom you had a relationship, would you tell us about them now?</span></p> <p><span id="s3094">A: You mean it doesn't matter about which part of my life?</span></p> <p><span id="s3095">Q: No, no, I mean you said you met and you had relationships with married women.</span> <span id="s3096">Who were they, or do you want to share that?</span></p> <p><span id="s3097">A: Who were they?</span> <span id="s3098">I can only share the people in Europe.</span> <span id="s3099">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s3100">A: Because I'm not sure whether they would recognize who I mean without even mentioning names because they might be alive.</span> <span id="s3101">I don't know.</span> <span id="s3102">Their children might remember me being in the family, because I was fully accepted.</span> <span id="s3103">The husbands didn't miss anything and they didn't know.</span> <span id="s3104">So, I've had it in both countries, in Europe as well as here.</span> <span id="s3105">But women would always come to me.</span> <span id="s3106">I would never -- I can't find anybody in that part of my life that I approached first, I mean.</span> <span id="s3107">They approached me, or they tried.</span> <span id="s3108">There were lots of people that tried to get into my favors and they didn't.</span> <span id="s3109">I didn't respond.</span> <span id="s3110">I would have been too busy because I a lot in the United States also.</span> <span id="s3111">If you have 500 committee women cruising around admiring you and wanting attention and they wanted too much attention.</span></p> <p><span id="s3112">Tape #15</span></p> <p><span id="s3113">A: I was trying to be friendly and go to committee meetings and this is a very small committee.</span></p> <p><span id="s3114">There are about eight, seven or eight women.</span></p> <p><span id="s3115">Q: Do you remember the situation, was it an announcement of a concert you were giving?</span></p> <p><span id="s3116">A: No, they were discussing probably where they would put the poster with my picture on it, or they were discussing something.</span> <span id="s3117">I remember that we made our own posters in the very beginning.</span> <span id="s3118">We made them silk screening in the garage.</span> <span id="s3119">And my nephew, who I talked about in connection with his illness, he was a good one to draw pictures.</span> <span id="s3120">He drew a picture for a poster for a concert for children with instruments on the picture and so forth.</span> <span id="s3121">Here they are just looking at my --.</span> <span id="s3122">What do you want me to say about this one?</span></p> <p><span id="s3123">Q: You don't remember where it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s3124">A: I remember some of the players and I remember that this was a rehearsal.</span></p> <p><span id="s3125">Q: Tell us what you played -- just what comes up to your mind.</span> <span id="s3126">I think we could use the picture then when we make a better quality just to show you as a conductor.</span> <span id="s3127">And you can tell us a little bit.</span> <span id="s3128">This was a rehearsal and we rehearsed this and I remember the players, simple things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3129">A: I remember several of the players.</span> <span id="s3130">I remember that this was a rehearsal and I remember some of the players.</span> <span id="s3131">This was my first cellist at the time.</span> <span id="s3132">His name was , and he even wrote to the newspaper after it was all over, the Philharmonic, about me as a conductor.</span> <span id="s3133">He defended something.</span> <span id="s3134">I don't remember the article, but I remember that I read an article by who had sent in that particular piece and he sits right there, the first cellist.</span> <span id="s3135">A very nice gesture of him to do that, to do, because I was not conducting anymore when he wrote that article.</span></p> <p><span id="s3136">Q: How were you dressed when you were conducting, like we see you here with the white, long</span></p> <p><span id="s3137">--?</span></p> <p><span id="s3138">A: For the longest time I had just a straight white dress, long.</span> <span id="s3139">I never had anything black, imitation masculine thing or anything like that.</span> <span id="s3140">I did that more in Holland because I played for the theater many times and I was sitting with men playing the cello, then I wore something, an imitation tuxedo top, and white shirt and bow tie.</span> <span id="s3141">But I never tried to be masculine looking in the United States for conducting.</span> <span id="s3142">I always had a stylish and the ladies had some say int he matter.</span> <span id="s3143">They felt I should have something more dressy.</span> <span id="s3144">This was not very dressy.</span> <span id="s3145">It was just white satin.</span> <span id="s3146">But the ladies got a little more say in the matter what I should wear, an of course that was the beginning of the society.</span> <span id="s3147">The 500 women that I had to know and shake hands with occasionally was very annoying.</span> <span id="s3148">I mean, the society angle was annoying for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s3149">Q: Do you have the picture?</span> <span id="s3150">We would like you to say this is a picture of your father and turn it around and hold it very quietly and talk a little bit about what your father meant to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s3151">A: Now this is a picture of my father like I mostly saw him.</span> <span id="s3152">He had that kind of hair and beard when I had my concert with him where he was introducing me to the Dutch public, and I have all the write ups sent to my sister's daughter to save because someone kept a with all his-- I don't know who assembled all his criticisms in the newspapers, but in that book that I sent to my niece is also the write ups that I had when I was 17 and played for the first time in Amsterdam.</span></p> <p><span id="s3153">Q: Did you feel close to your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s3154">A: Yes, I felt that I had so much of his trait inherited, but I did not have the egocentric trait that everything had to go to me.</span> <span id="s3155">I felt more that I had to watch out that I don't have those traits.</span> <span id="s3156">That I don't boss people too much, he was very tyrannic.</span> <span id="s3157">He wanted everything to go the way he wanted it to go.</span> <span id="s3158">He wanted to be the boss of society of music teachers that he started.</span> <span id="s3159">He wanted to be the president for 25 years.</span> <span id="s3160">He wanted to write the articles in monthly for 25 years.</span> <span id="s3161">In fact, he was the president until he died.</span> <span id="s3162">And I tried to not be like him, because all my friends knew how he had been, because I told them.</span> <span id="s3163">So, that's what Ivy would say, don't start "Belinfanting" all over the place.</span> <span id="s3164">That means ordering me around, because I know who you take after.</span> <span id="s3165">That was really funny, because I got a little warning and I pulled in my horns a little bit, because I can be bossy.</span></p> <p><span id="s3166">Q: Did your father always have a long beard and so much hair?</span></p> <p><span id="s3167">A: Oh, yes, to our great chagrin, because he would spill some food and he would sit like this and try to get it out of his beard and I didn't like his beard.</span></p> <p><span id="s3168">Q: But you have always known him with the long hair and a long beard?</span></p> <p><span id="s3169">A: Yes, for most of his life.</span> <span id="s3170">After I was gone, after I was a student, he had a beard.</span> <span id="s3171">This is a picture of my husband meeting with Ellen Schwartz who later, Ellen Schwartz later came to Holland and there was a rather funny mix up because she had left Holland illegally to get married when she was 21, and I was not even 20, but her husband got in touch with me later by mail and sent me a Russian letter that I could not understand to thank me for what I had done for her and invited me to meet him in Germany.</span> <span id="s3172">And he would invite me when there was no vacation, and I wanted to go, and it was one of the times that I told my father that he did not like to hear.</span> <span id="s3173">Because one of the times that he wanted to meet me in Germany he said I'm going to pay for your trip.</span> <span id="s3174">I seen him several times in Germany, but the first time he paid for my trip and I saw him in because he had a bad heart.</span> <span id="s3175">He died very young.</span> <span id="s3176">His heart, rheumatic fever or something had made him very vulnerable, so he didn't live very long.</span> <span id="s3177">I think he had died already when this picture came out that you showed me because I was married.</span> <span id="s3178">That was one of the later times that Ellen came back to Holland.</span> <span id="s3179">But the first time she came back, the authorities were wondering she is coming to Holland, well we have her listed in Holland.</span> <span id="s3180">We don't have her coming to Holland.</span> <span id="s3181">There was quite a confusion, but anyway they straightened it out.</span></p> <p><span id="s3182">Q: Maybe you could put on your glasses --</span></p> <p><span id="s3183">A: Yes, I know that picture of him.</span> <span id="s3184">That is the way he looked when we went out together to distribute identity cards.</span> <span id="s3185">I want to tell you too about Ellen Schwartz, that she came back to Holland several times after she lost her husband.</span> <span id="s3186">He died, as I said, young.</span> <span id="s3187">She came back to her family, even though they made terrible -- they finally straightened it out that she was legally in Holland and back and forth, and she remarried a Jewish fellow and she tried to escape with him.</span> <span id="s3188">She was very stubborn as far as I was concerned because she knew better how to do it and she had a couple that were going to take people out of Holland in the war years for money, but he had a way of getting them to Switzerland, but she didn't want any interference or help from me.</span> <span id="s3189">She was very stubborn and she had this Jewish husband and I still remember that she said to me in '43 or so, that she was going to follow and she said you can meet me and the couple just before we leave and give me identity cards.</span> <span id="s3190">I had made two identity cards for them and I met the couple and I thought they were terrible.</span> <span id="s3191">I met them in a house that obviously was not lived in.</span> <span id="s3192">It was made up with some furniture and they were low class people, but she didn't want any interference from me.</span> <span id="s3193">She didn't want any help from me.</span> <span id="s3194">She was just sure of them.</span> <span id="s3195">If those people are not right, I want to be dead.</span> <span id="s3196">In other words, I trust them so much that if these people are traitors, I want to be dead.</span> <span id="s3197">And I never forgot that, because it didn't sound right to me.</span> <span id="s3198">The whole thing didn't sound right but he wanted to see me and he knew that I made an offer of illegal identity cards and I showed him one that I had made and he said, "Marvelously done, very well done."</span> <span id="s3199">And then we parted.</span> <span id="s3200">They went their way, and Ellen Schwartz went her way and I had a very very bad feeling about this whole thing.</span> <span id="s3201">And she was supposed to leave the next morning and I went back home and I met Rudy and I said, "Rudy, would you do something for me.</span> <span id="s3202">They are leaving tomorrow and they are assembling, he says he has a group of people they are assembling in the Central Station Amsterdam in the hall.</span> <span id="s3203">Would you check up on that because they don't know you.</span> <span id="s3204">Nobody knows you."</span> <span id="s3205">And he said, "I will."</span> <span id="s3206">So, he went to the Central Station and he came back to my house around noon and he said "You're right, it's no good.</span> <span id="s3207">I've seen the group and they were singled together as a group and there was a blond woman and a man with it and obviously there were people that were going on a train ride somewhere."</span> <span id="s3208">But he said, "It looked very very bad.</span> <span id="s3209">I think they are deported and I think I saw that couple that you met the other day."</span> <span id="s3210">And that is true.</span> <span id="s3211">They were traitors.</span></p> <p><span id="s3212">They got money for each Jew they brought to that group.</span> <span id="s3213">And I know somebody of the family of other friends of mine had joined that group, too, because they believed in this couple.</span> <span id="s3214">And I still hear in my ears if they are traitors, I want to die.</span> <span id="s3215">And I don't know they must have worked on that for weeks to be friends of Ellen Schwartz and her second husband.</span> <span id="s3216">And I immediately had the feeling they were no good.</span> <span id="s3217">And I could not get her to even believe me, listen to me, follow me.</span> <span id="s3218">She knew better, and that's what happened.</span> <span id="s3219">They must have gotten on a transport of traitors that got war stricken.</span> <span id="s3220">I don't even want to think about it, because that was years after because I went to school with her and traveled to Berlin when I 17, and you know I was almost 40 years old during the occupation.</span> <span id="s3221">But I had always kept contact, knew where she was.</span> <span id="s3222">And she came back to Holland and she went back to Berlin, but she married the second time just to protect this very Jewish looking young man.</span> <span id="s3223">I mean she was not even in love.</span> <span id="s3224">They were beyond that.</span> <span id="s3225">They were trying to save their lives, because that was in '43.</span> <span id="s3226">But Rudy told me what he saw and I knew that was the same couple.</span> <span id="s3227">And I don't know whether we found the couple or whether we didn't.</span> <span id="s3228">I never found out what happened after I left Holland and how many traitors really were punished.</span> <span id="s3229">I read it in a book that I got from Tony, what I found out.</span> <span id="s3230">But they were very very dark moments in my life that I have not talked to you about, but this is one.</span> <span id="s3231">The death of my brother is another.</span> <span id="s3232">There are so many highlights and so many deep deep miseries that have happened that I know of that I say it's extremes all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s3233">Q: Tell us on camera why you don't like to talk so very much about the dark moments?</span></p> <p><span id="s3234">A: Well, this is a story that is of the lowest characteristics of some humans that I hate to talk about because I hate to think about it myself.</span> <span id="s3235">I don't even want to know how many people are walking around and playing fair weather that are able to do these things.</span> <span id="s3236">I mean, a person who is able to make money by pretending for weeks or months that he will help you to save your life and take money from the people that want to save their life and then be the traitor who sells them to the Gestapo to be murdered when they get to the gas chambers.</span></p> <p><span id="s3237">That is so low and so far down in the depth of evil that I hate to talk about it.</span> <span id="s3238">I hate to think about it.</span> <span id="s3239">I hate that they are there.</span> <span id="s3240">I hate to remember it, but I certainly don't want to go out and tell people this because you don't learn from that.</span> <span id="s3241">You only learn one thing and I have know that a long time and I tell it all the time in general that we human beings are the most evil creatures that are put on this earth.</span> <span id="s3242">There is no animal that has the cunning and the wish to do that evil things that humans do.</span> <span id="s3243">I'm not proud to be a human being.</span> <span id="s3244">I think we have very very evil traits in the human race.</span> <span id="s3245">I don't find an animal that even comes close to that.</span> <span id="s3246">We use our intelligence in two directions.</span> <span id="s3247">One is evil and I point out already why.</span> <span id="s3248">I don't want to even repeat the story, and also we busy ourselves to look and find out what is in the universe and what is a black hole and how you can live maybe on Mars or on the moon because it gets too crowded here.</span> <span id="s3249">I mean, we get it to crowed.</span> <span id="s3250">We, it doesn't, we do.</span> <span id="s3251">I mean that's the human race that doesn't see danger when it comes so close that it is impossible.</span> <span id="s3252">I wouldn't be able to if they gave me all power because I would have to kill people all the time, and that's what we are doing now.</span> <span id="s3253">We are killing more people, more people and we are creating more people and we diminish the real intelligent people and the people who are wise, could be wise.</span> <span id="s3254">I think Einstein would know better what to do than any professor today.</span> <span id="s3255">Because, they don't know what to do.</span> <span id="s3256">If you ask people what are we going to do.</span> <span id="s3257">I used to support zero population, but we are too far away from zero population and my contribution is not doing any good because we need money and we need help for the people that are famished, people that don't have enough.</span> <span id="s3258">We spoil the earth and we have all these organizations that you can support like wildlife and what have you.</span> <span id="s3259">Why not save humanity.</span> <span id="s3260">I don't see that we are really doing anything effective except having more babies.</span></p> <p><span id="s3261">Q: You said you learned a long time ago that human beings can be very evil, when did you learn that and how?</span></p> <p><span id="s3262">A: Because life taught me that.</span> <span id="s3263">I mean, what I saw in the world, the traitors and the people selling people.</span> <span id="s3264">I mean I got so close that I saw that evil.</span> <span id="s3265">It is much worse than I thought.</span> <span id="s3266">When I was young, I was upset, my day was ruined when I saw a dead animal that had been killed by an automobile or something and I didn't get the picture out of my mind all day of the accident that we killed an animal that was walking the center of the street.</span> <span id="s3267">But I don't get that feeling any more.</span> <span id="s3268">It is completely blunted because of all the things that I've seen that are much worse.</span> <span id="s3269">I mean, I don't really cringe when I read the paper that there is a murder.</span></p> <p><span id="s3270">There is always some bad thing on the front page.</span> <span id="s3271">never anybody is building up the beauty.</span> <span id="s3272">People are making music to be famous.</span> <span id="s3273">They are not making music to -- there are some little things that are here or there that people are doing something good for somebody, but it's almost invisible from all the junk that we get to read, of the murders and the tortures and how human beings still torture each other.</span> <span id="s3274">That's what we get.</span> <span id="s3275">That's our food.</span> <span id="s3276">And at a certain time you don't feel anything anymore.</span> <span id="s3277">I know that personally because when I arrived in Switzerland and I was a refugee in that hotel with 160 Jews that had fled at various times, all I felt is that my soul was dead.</span> <span id="s3278">I thought I will never make a note of music.</span> <span id="s3279">I wouldn't know why, but I didn't feel anything.</span> <span id="s3280">Nothing affected me.</span> <span id="s3281">I didn't have any desire to make music.</span> <span id="s3282">I thought that was past.</span> <span id="s3283">And I think it took about three months to a year to be able to be myself again.</span> <span id="s3284">It kind of sank down and it kind of prompted me to have an entirely different look on life.</span> <span id="s3285">The real joy that I had as a child and the trust in human beings and the trust in humanity, that has never come back.</span> <span id="s3286">I don't feel proud to be a human being.</span> <span id="s3287">I think we are the evilist creature that I ever met in general.</span> <span id="s3288">I have met wonderful people, and that's the only thing that keeps me alive, that there are wonderful people.</span> <span id="s3289">And there are people that I immediately feel are a friend, you know, I felt that way when you came in.</span> <span id="s3290">It is not the people I know.</span> <span id="s3291">The people I know and want to know there are friends among them.</span> <span id="s3292">And that is the only thing that keeps you alive is that there is beauty in human beings too, but not enough.</span> <span id="s3293">And there is something that I wish I had never learned about, and that is the evil that is possible, the cruelty that is possible.</span> <span id="s3294">The rest of it is terrible.</span> <span id="s3295">I don't know why we got it, as you know, I'm not religious.</span> <span id="s3296">I say always in joking, I don't know why the beard has allowed this.</span> <span id="s3297">Because I think there is a very childish concept people have of God.</span> <span id="s3298">They say God made us according - no, we made God according to us.</span> <span id="s3299">We think of somebody, there is not somebody.</span> <span id="s3300">There is a universe and we don't understand it and I never will, but I'm part of the universe.</span> <span id="s3301">That's all I know.</span></p></body></html>
