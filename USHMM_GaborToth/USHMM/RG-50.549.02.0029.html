you’re from and where we’re -- where we are right now, and the date.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Answer: My name is Leon Chameides, originally pronounced Humeidis and we’re now sitting at 65 Westbridge Drive, in West Hartford, Connecticut, my current home.</span> <span id="s14">I was born in Cutuvitsa, Poland in south -- southern Poland, in 1935.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: Okay, now, Dr. Chameides, I -- I’d like to start a little bit -- just before the period that we -- we were planning to begin.</span> <span id="s16">Just at those -- those last days that you recall before liberation.</span> <span id="s17">Did you have an anticipation that something was -- was going to happen.</span> <span id="s18">What -- Do you recall what your feelings were at thas -- that time just before -- just before liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: I think, first of all, I have to emphasize the fact that in 1944, I was nine years old.</span> <span id="s20">And I had been away from home for a little over two years, since August of 1942.</span> <span id="s21">And if you remember your feelings at nine years of age, it’s very difficult to separate out, and to recall exactly what one’s feelings were at that time and what occurred later and I’m very -- always very careful not to read in things that occurred later and attribute them to that time.</span> <span id="s22">I was in a small village by the name of Univ, which is near the large city of Lvov, now in the Ukraine.</span> <span id="s23">Univ was very close to the extermination camp of Belzyce.</span> <span id="s24">But I was hidden in a monastery, the Univ monastery was the mother monastery of the stunite monks of the Ukrainian Catholic Church.</span> <span id="s25">I was, by that time, a Greek Catholic in my -- in my approach really, but with fairly vivid feelings and recollections of being Jewish.</span> <span id="s26">And we, of course, knew that things were happening, because the front was coming closer and closer to us.</span> <span id="s27">There were the tremendous amount of warfare.</span> <span id="s28">The Ukrainian partisans were fighting on the German side and then saw that Germany was going to lose and there was a lot of confusion.</span> <span id="s29">So a lot of the village people were involved in the fighting, and the fighting -- the front came close and closer to us.</span> <span id="s30">We could hear it, we could see it’s effects.</span> <span id="s31">I’m not sure that I had any feeling in terms of that I was going to be liberated.</span> <span id="s32">It was -- There was a certain amount of excitement in the -- in a war coming, but of course we had been through this so many times before, that the issue then was primarily how to survive and how to get the next meal.</span> <span id="s33">I think those were much more of immediate concern to us -- or to me, at least, than anything else.</span> <span id="s34">For reasons I’m not clear, we had one healer, I don't know whether he was a physician or not, but one person who knew something about medicine in the area, that I managed to become his helper at the ripe age of nine and we set up a -- a hospital in the church and we brought in -- the wounded were brought in from the -- and one of my jobs -- course, we had no medicines at all, and one of my jobs was after the battles, to run into the forest and to rummage around, find dead soldiers, particularly if they were German, because they would usually have bandages and first aid material on them, and get as much of that material as possible.</span> <span id="s35">If they were bandaged -- their wounds were bandaged, I would take the wou -- bandages off and then run back and wash them, so we could use them on the -- on the Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s36">This helped me a great deal.</span> <span id="s37">It taught me a lot and also, it -- it helped me because on Sundays, the farmers, the families would come and then -- and they would -- to see their husbands and youngsters and -- and I would always be around and so I would get eggs and cheese and milk and so there was food.</span> <span id="s38">So, we knew something was coming, the front was coming closer to us, the bombardments were more common.</span> <span id="s39">One heard a lot of shooting a-around and so we knew something big was -- was about to happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s41">And then, a-a-appreciating the fact that you were nine and that you’re not going -- going to recall, of course, all the details or even, you know, looking back at -- those number of years to exactly what you were feeling at the time, and appreciating that fact that you don’t want to reconstruct something, as you just said, what do you recall about those actual first moments of realizing that something was really changing now?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: Well, unfortunately for us, again, in my position, not that much changed, because when the Russians entered, I was on the wrong side, because almost as soon as the Russians entered, which as I recall was in June of 1944, Stalin, as you recall, was a firm opponent of the Greek Catholic Church.</span> <span id="s43">The Greek Catholic Church was a nationalist church, it was very much bound up with Ukrainian nationalism and with a drive for independence on the part of the Ukraine, from the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s44">And so Stalin, who eventually outlawed the Greek Catholic Church, imme -- almost immediately began persecuting the priests.</span> <span id="s45">And so, we would see now, instead of Jews being shot, we would see priests being shot.</span> <span id="s46">And so, one day, I had heard that there was a -- a horse drawn wagon going to be going to the big city of Lvov and I felt that I had to get out of Univ and so I took one of the younger boys, who is now in Israel.</span> <span id="s47">His name now is Oded Amarand, but at that time, his name was Dodo, and we decided we would walk to this nearby village -- I have no i-idea of how much of a distance that was, in order to try to get this wagon, and on the way, we were stopped by Russian soldiers a-and a Russian patrol stopped us.</span> <span id="s48">And children were very often used as spies, so we were highly suspect.</span> <span id="s49">And I remember sitting in, behind a bush, crouched with my arms up in the air as this Russian was standing in front of us, not knowing -- with a tommy gun -- not knowing what to do.</span> <span id="s50">And finally, after what seemed like an eternity, I talked them into allowing us to go to a farmhouse and -- which he did, and eventually he let us go back to Univ.</span> <span id="s51">A-And then, it was I think several weeks before another horse drawn carriage was going -- this time I think from Univ, if I recall correctly, and to Lvov, which is a ridiculously small distance when covered by car, but is incredibly lengthy by horse-drawn carriage.</span> <span id="s52">And I was able to get on that and went to Lvov, to the mother church, Santa Yura -- which is the Ukrainian for Saint George, in Lvov.</span> <span id="s53">And it was in Santa Yura, and I don’t know how long I was there at this time, I don’t get the impression it was a long time, but I really don’t have a good concept of time, it could have been weeks, or might have been months, I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s54">But i-it was during the morning mass that I remember, which was celebrated by Brat Yosef, Brother Joseph was his name, I remember the way he looked, a bald head with a white beard.</span> <span id="s55">And he was celebrating the mass and in the middle of the mass, in walked two boys who were dressed differently than I was.</span> <span id="s56">But the dress and their faces were familiar to me, but I wasn’t sure from where.</span> <span id="s57">I was dressed at the time in pants made of burlap, because we had nothing, and shoes made of -- of wood, soles made of wood, because there was no leather.</span> <span id="s58">And here come these two boys, who are already better dressed.</span> <span id="s59">They’re in short pants, in a western style, better material.</span> <span id="s60">And that was -- one of the boys was my brother and the other one was a young man who is now a chemist in San Francisco.</span> <span id="s61">And they motioned to me and -- and I went with them and I remember going to have something to eat first, because we didn’t eat before mass and so we had something to eat and -- and they took me out of the monastery.</span> <span id="s62">So -- So that’s how I got out of the monastery.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: When did you realize that that was your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: I -- I think -- I think I realized almost immediately, but I wasn’t a hundred percent certain.</span> <span id="s65">I hadn’t seen him in a -- two and a half years and at that age, there’s a big change that occurs in -- in people.</span> <span id="s66">But I -- I think I realized almost immediately that it was.</span> <span id="s67">Cause I had thought about him a great deal while I was in hiding and the -- the Studite monks made a tremendous effort to always keep us separated, because they were afraid that if we were ever together, we would not only give each other away, but they were in mortal danger themselves, because they were really -- would -- would have been killed had it been known they were hiding Jews.</span> <span id="s68">So -- And I remember once, I was in Univ, in the attic.</span> <span id="s69">I found a pair of pants that I was absolutely certain were his and that were hidden there, but I’m -- I’m not sure the --</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: Do you recall when you finally realized and when you did, you know, connect with him?</span> <span id="s71">Do you -- Do you -- Do you remember?</span> <span id="s72">Was it -- Was it sa -- Was there enough tension so that the -- the reunion wasn’t particularly joyful at the -- at that moment or d-do you recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: You know, I don’t, and I honestly don’t remember emotions very well and -- and again, you know, we had been through so many eventful days and so many eventful months and years, that it seemed like I was almost numb and that nothing surprised me, so here it is.</span> <span id="s74">I mean, I -- I don’t -- unless I don’t remember correctly, which is also possible, but I do not recall a particularly strong emotion.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: That makes me wonder whether, I mean, especially with children and you see children nowadays in Bosnia, for example, whether they -- di-di-did you have an idea that this was not normal, what you were going through, or did you just think this is what hap -- not that you would have consciously thought, but did -- do you recall if you would have thought, “This is not normal, this is not supposed to be happening?”</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: I -- I don’t think I had -- I don’t think I had sophisticated thoughts of that nature.</span> <span id="s77">I -- I think clearly, you know, at -- at least at the very beginning, I missed my parents tremendously.</span> <span id="s78">I was terribly scared a good portion of the time.</span> <span id="s79">But -- But the immediate things were hunger, were -- were loneliness, were trying to make sure that one didn’t give oneself away by either saying one was Jewish -- we were particularly marked because it -- we were in a society where only Jews were circumcised, so I was always -- I had to be very, very careful, never go -- to go to the bathroom when other boys were there, never to bathe together.</span> <span id="s80">So, I was always conscious -- so it was this type of peculiar thing, where on the one hand, you know, I followed the ritual of -- of the Catholic church, on the other hand, I -- there was a conscious part of me, because I had to be conscious in order not to give myself away.</span> <span id="s81">But, I think children have an incredible capacity to adapt and -- and I think only those who adapted remained alive.</span> <span id="s82">I think those who didn’t adapt or couldn’t adapt, didn’t survive.</span> <span id="s83">So, in a way, there’s already a group that’s -- there’s a selection process there.</span> <span id="s84">[sneezes]</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: Bless you.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: Excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: So, what you’re describing, in terms of -- whereas for some people in -- in other parts of Europe, there -- there was a liberation, there was a sense that, you know, this chapter is over.</span> <span id="s88">But in -- What you’re describing is -- is at least up -- up through parts of 1946, exchanged one oppressor for another, such --</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: Well, not through ‘46, because this was -- we did not stay under the Russians til ‘46, so -- so th -- what I’m describing now, is the immediate liberation by the Russians.</span> <span id="s90">And again, you know, I think every person, of course, is different and -- and adapts differently, but also, I think the age makes a big difference.</span> <span id="s91">I notice, for instance, people who were just a few years older than I, had different reactions than I did, because they -- I think you develop a sense of perspective and -- and -- and knowledge of the world, which, I think at the age of seven, or even nine, y-you just don’t have.</span> <span id="s92">So, y-you have a different, you know -- you may develop the skills for survival and the skills for turning yourself into someone else and pretending to be someone else, but -- but -- but you can’t put that into a perspective.</span> <span id="s93">So, I mean, to me it was very confusing, because my native language, my mother tongue was German.</span> <span id="s94">And -- And as I was a youngster, that was the height of culture.</span> <span id="s95">So -- So wh-when the German invasion came in, I thought this was great.</span> <span id="s96">Now, I’ll be able to speak my language.</span> <span id="s97">So, you know, I was naive, I didn’t know anything about the persecutions which had already -- I didn’t know much about Hitler or anything like that.</span> <span id="s98">I was in a different age frame and I had a different, you know, perspective on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: I guess the reason I -- I mentioned ‘46 was not necessarily that it was going to be continuous oppression for you, but the events of -- I guess it was June ‘46, and the rampages in -- was it Kilsen?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: Kelsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: Kelsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: Well, I was already out of eastern Europe by that time.</span> <span id="s103">We, just to go back a little bit, after I was taken out of the monastery, we went to -- the person who was responsible for even knowing that we were in the monastery was Rabbi David Kahana, who became the chief Rabbi of the Polish army.</span> <span id="s104">And he himself and his wife and two children were hidden in the monastery.</span> <span id="s105">He as a priest, his wife as a nun.</span> <span id="s106">He wrote a book called, “The Lvov Ghetto Diary.”</span> <span id="s107">And he was a -- He was good friends with my father.</span> <span id="s108">And, in fact, the two of them went to metropolish -- metropolithishipditsky together, which eventually led to th -- him hiding us.</span> <span id="s109">So, he knew of our whereabouts.</span> <span id="s110">He also knew that our parents didn’t survive.</span> <span id="s111">And so he made it his business to make sure that we were taken out of the monastery, whereas, as you know, there were children, including a good friend of mine who was with me in Univ, whose parents not survive, who simply no one knew that they were there and they were just left there, and then became the object of a lot of post-war court cases for the community to try to get some of these children back.</span> <span id="s112">So, we went with my brother and -- and Nathan, who was the other boy, to Rabbi Kahana, and Rabbi Kahana told us at that point that our parents had perished and he had a -- a little note that my mother had written, which she gave to him for safekeeping, which he gave us.</span> <span id="s113">And then the question was, “Do you know what to do with us?”</span> <span id="s114">I was nine, my brother was 11 and a half and my brother had been placed with a family who had survived the war and there was a husband, wife and the young son of his age and they were willing to take him in.</span> <span id="s115">And they knew of a woman by the name of Tolla Wasserman -- her maiden name was Ashkenazi, who had been born in 1909, in Lvov and who had gone through the war, was hidden by her maid, she had a Polish maid who was able to cordon off one room in the apartment, very much like Anne Frank’s thing, and they remained there for 18 months.</span> <span id="s116">And so she was the only one in the family who survived, she was alone and Mr. and Mrs. Frost, who were the people that my brother was staying with -- and went to her and asked her whether she would be willing to take me in, and she did.</span> <span id="s117">My brother did not remain with the Frosts, he -- he had a lot of difficulty in becoming a part of any new home at all, and -- and left, but I remained with -- with Tolla Wasserman from 1944, I believe November, until her death in 1964.</span> <span id="s118">And, it was really, I think a great deal.</span> <span id="s119">I think, thanks to her that I am where I am.</span> <span id="s120">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: Why do you think that -- wa-was it the age difference th-that made it so difficult for your brother, whereas it was possible for you to adapt, even thought it’s only two and a half years?</span> <span id="s122">Perhaps a significant time.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s124">You know, one of the difficulties we always have in -- in trying to ascribe any reasons for anything, is that we have no controls.</span> <span id="s125">And I don’t know what would have happened to me had I been his age.</span> <span id="s126">I think part of it was age, but I don’t think it was all age.</span> <span id="s127">I think I have had, since then, and -- and before, a tremendous ability to adapt to reality, which served me well, so I think part of it may have been age, but I don’t think all of it.</span> <span id="s128">I think part of it has to do with personality.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s130">So, when you -- I want to ask you to back up just a moment, when you learned of your parents death, was this something that you were almost anticipating learning, or were you shocked?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: No, I -- I was not shocked and I would have been, I think shocked had I learned otherwise.</span> <span id="s132">It -- It came as a -- when I think back on it in a very, almost unemotional matter of fact issue.</span> <span id="s133">Everyone was dead, I mean it’s much more shocking to me now, looking back, than it was at that time.</span> <span id="s134">Perhaps that was a protective mechanism, but I didn’t -- I don’t remember, either shock or sadness, or any type of real feeling about it at the time.</span> <span id="s135">It’s much more painful to me now than it was then.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: Do you -- Do you recall at all, what your actual reaction was when you learned?</span> <span id="s137">What you said, what you --</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: I -- I don’t recall, but I -- I don’t -- I mean, I remember being in the room and I remember being told, and I simply don’t remember any reaction at all.</span> <span id="s139">I -- I had -- I don’t -- didn’t have any reaction.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s141">Do you f -- Did you feel that living with -- with Tolla Wasserman was -- was like being in a new family, being in a real family, or how did -- how did you feel about her, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: Yeah, well, we -- we became very close.</span> <span id="s143">I started by calling her Chacha, which is the Polish word for aunt.</span> <span id="s144">And within a few weeks, I asked her whether I could call her mother, which I did.</span> <span id="s145">So, we became very close.</span> <span id="s146">And she had no one.</span> <span id="s147">She was a wonderful, wonderful human being, and so I was part of her family, although there was her -- she had lost her husband and lost her family.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s149">So, did you live in different places together or to --</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: Well, in -- in Lvov, if you remember, Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin met at the altar and divided th-the eastern sphere and Lvov was given to the Soviet Union when the map of Poland was redrawn.</span> <span id="s151">Part of that agreement allowed former Polish citizens to choose whether they wanted to remain there or to move into the western part of Poland, and of course, our intent was to move westward.</span> <span id="s152">So, I started going to school in Lvov on -- in Russian school and I did have some education in -- in -- during the war, in Univ, but not a lot.</span> <span id="s153">So, I think it was the first time that I really went to an organized school, and then we were given the opportunity to -- to go by train to western Lvov -- to western Poland.</span> <span id="s154">We went there sometime in 19 -- I believe it was in the spring of ‘45 and we went by cattle car.</span> <span id="s155">Those were -- The only trains available were cattle cars.</span> <span id="s156">And there were horrendous stories be -- circulating, of people who had gone before, who would be going on open cattle cars, a distance that before the war used to take maybe two or three hours to cover by train, taking two and three weeks.</span> <span id="s157">And the Russians would simply stop in the -- in fields and then -- and just refuse to go on.</span> <span id="s158">And there seemed to be no schedule, there was no control.</span> <span id="s159">Th-The war was still going on and -- and people were freezing to death in the fields.</span> <span id="s160">So there was a lot of fear about going on those trains, but we were very lucky for two reasons.</span> <span id="s161">One is that Tolla Wasserman, my new mother, had befriended a person -- a doctor and each train had a -- one covered cattle car, which had a Red Cross on it and he suggested that we go in that car, so we had covering.</span> <span id="s162">And the second thing he did was, he bought, at enormous expense, a -- a bottle of -- a -- a case of vodka.</span> <span id="s163">And the first day we were out, the train stopped in the field and he called the engineer into this covered car -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: Okay, continuing now.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s166">He took a bottle of vodka out, showed it to the engineer and then heaved it out the open door, and it shattered.</span> <span id="s167">And the engineer showed his anguish and he said, “I want you to know that every morning, I’m going to take a bottle and I’m going to throw it out the door.</span> <span id="s168">Whatever is left in that case when we get to our destination, is yours.”</span> <span id="s169">And we got there in two and a half days, which is absolutely amazing.</span> <span id="s170">So that’s how we got there, but now that I think back on it, we celebrated the end of the European war, VE Day, while still in Lvov, because I remember, we were living at that time on -- in an apartment on 15 Mawitskago Street, in Lvov and the apartment was deemed too large for just my mother and myself.</span> <span id="s171">So they billeted a whole slew of Russian soldiers with us.</span> <span id="s172">And many of the soldiers were wounded.</span> <span id="s173">There was a -- an elderly gentleman who was the father of one of the younger soldiers and then there were other young soldiers.</span> <span id="s174">Many of them had lost arms, lost legs and therefore they were taken from the front.</span> <span id="s175">And they had bought a case of vodka and mother said, “No, you’re not going to get drunk here.”</span> <span id="s176">And she locked up the vodka.</span> <span id="s177">And then they said, “No, no, we’re going to celebrate, because it’s the end of the war.”</span> <span id="s178">And she said, “I don’t believe you, but if it’s really the end of the war, I will buy you another case.”</span> <span id="s179">So, we went out to the main square, because no one had radios, we went out to the main square and after awhile, Stalin came on the loudspeaker and -- and announced the end of the war.</span> <span id="s180">So the -- I think that was VE Day, so we were still in Lvov at that time.</span> <span id="s181">During that time also, I went to school, as I mentioned.</span> <span id="s182">I also worked after school in a cosmetics store.</span> <span id="s183">And I remember Russian soldiers used to come in and they would buy five bottles of Eau de Cologne and they would hit it against something, take off the tops and drink -- drink that down.</span> <span id="s184">They’d drink anything that had any kind of alcohol content in it.</span> <span id="s185">And I was at that time already, very cute.</span> <span id="s186">My hair had grown back, and mother made sure that I was always dressed meticulously.</span> <span id="s187">And so, I reminded many of them of their own children, I think.</span> <span id="s188">So they would very often come to the store and after buying something, they would ask me to come with them for a walk or to come and drink beer.</span> <span id="s189">There was a hotel by the name of Hotel Georges, and they used to take me to Hotel Georges to drink beer.</span> <span id="s190">And then I would always go with them, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: This would have been ‘40 --</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: This was ‘44, beginning of ‘45, really ‘45, and I would go with them and on one occasion we were coming back and there was a street photographer and so he took a pho -- they asked to stop, and they took three photographs and one of those photographs of me and two Russian soldiers is hanging on my wall in the dining room.</span> <span id="s193">Often wondered where the oth -- soldiers are.</span> <span id="s194">And then, the other thing that used to happen to me again, to show you the adaptability, is that the Black Market was the only way you could make a living.</span> <span id="s195">You couldn’t make a living any other way, so everyone was Black Marketeering.</span> <span id="s196">And the Black Market at that time consisted of soldiers who were stationed in Germany, bringing stuff back from the west.</span> <span id="s197">They would bring stuff back from the British or the Americans, who would barter for -- for stuff, and then they’d come back and sell it and then we would sell it further.</span> <span id="s198">And one of the big items was, for some reason or other, mother of pearl buttons.</span> <span id="s199">So we used to get a lot of mother of pearl buttons in the cosmetic store, which was a state run store and those would be held under the counter and then people would come in who knew about it and would buy them.</span> <span id="s200">And whenever there was a raid or anyone would come, they very often would put the mother of pearl under my shirt, around me, because the soldiers were less likely to search children.</span> <span id="s201">And -- So I would find myself with mother of pearl buttons on a -- sewn on a -- on material wound around me.</span> <span id="s202">And one day they found it on me and they -- they took me to the Encoverdare, as the NVD was at that time called, Encoverdare headquarters.</span> <span id="s203">Mother came with me, she was very shocked and -- and she of course knew about it, but she was shocked that I was taken in.</span> <span id="s204">We went both.</span> <span id="s205">And no idea what was going to happen to us and the Encoverdare officer closes the door behind him and -- as we’re shaking, and turns to us and -- and -- and says in Russian, “Veehad sheety zheets, yatazhoy.”</span> <span id="s206">“You want to live, I also do.”</span> <span id="s207">And so he became part of the smuggling ring after that and he got a cut.</span> <span id="s208">And that was the end of that.</span> <span id="s209">So -- So that’s what life was like, you -- you adapted to -- there was one other episode that I remember from those days, and that was that the elderly gentleman I told you about, the Russian soldier, yeah?</span> <span id="s210">I don’t know when I say elderly, what I really mean.</span> <span id="s211">He probably was 40, but to me he was elderly.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: It’s amazing how our perspective changes with the years, doesn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: Right, and -- and one of them was -- one of the young men was his son and I remember one day, it was the Day of Atonement, Yom Kippur -- I -- I had no idea it was Yom Kippur, because I had just come out of the monastery.</span> <span id="s214">I -- I had brought from the -- from the monastery with me, and -- my clothes that I wore and three items.</span> <span id="s215">I brought my rosary, I brought my prayer book and I brought a blanket with which I covered myself during the two years and I learned never to give up that blanket, because that was the only thing that stood between me and the Ukrainian winter.</span> <span id="s216">Somewhere, the rosary and the prayer book got lost.</span> <span id="s217">My very strong suspicion is that Mother threw them out.</span> <span id="s218">But I’m not certain of that and maybe it’s unfair to accuse her of that, but I suspect that.</span> <span id="s219">But my -- Oh, no, there was a fourth item I brought with me, and that was a picture of myself in front of the church, which I still have, but, the blanket I still have.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: You still have the blanket?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: I still have the blanket.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: How do you look at the blanket now?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: Well, again, it’s taken on more meaning as I’ve gotten older.</span> <span id="s224">And we just had a grandson and we used -- we used that blanket during his circumcision.</span> <span id="s225">So -- where was I, where was I?</span> <span id="s226">Oh, I know wh-why I was telling you this.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: C-Could I interrupt for a moment?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: Anyway, please continue.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: So, the reason I was telling you this in a roundabout way is because of this old -- probably 40 year old gentleman who had came to Yom Kippur, to the Day of Atonement and as I said, I didn’t know that, because Mother was really not very observant -- religiously observant.</span> <span id="s231">So, we didn’t celebrate that at that time.</span> <span id="s232">But, he came to me and he asked me if I would stand at the door -- at the kitchen door and look out and warn him if his sons or any of his friends came.</span> <span id="s233">And I said, “Why do you want me to do that?”</span> <span id="s234">And he said, “Because I’d like to say some prayers, but I’m afraid that they might turn me in.”</span> <span id="s235">Because in the atheistic system in Russia, that wasn’t allowed and he was afraid of his own son, that he would turn him in.</span> <span id="s236">That made a big impression on me and I remember it to this day.</span> <span id="s237">The reason I mention this, is that -- is that I think another thing that I was very fortunate in was that I wasn’t thrown immediately from one religious experience into another.</span> <span id="s238">If I had been, my suspicion is that I would have rebelled.</span> <span id="s239">But, as I mentioned, Mother was not particularly a religious woman.</span> <span id="s240">On the other hand, she took a tremendous -- she had a sense of responsibility which she took very seriously, to make sure that I was brought up in a religious atmosphere, because my father had been the rabbi of Katowice and she felt an obligation to bring me up in the way they would have wanted.</span> <span id="s241">And so I did, later on, but I’m getting ahead of myself, go in to go to Yeshiva and so on.</span> <span id="s242">But at that time, as I think back on it, it was very -- I was very fortunate not to have been thrown into a religious environment.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: So -- Well, in -- in the -- in describing the -- the stran -- this rather rapid train ride, d-due to the strategy of -- just jumping ahead again here --</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: -- we’re talking about the end of 1945, in that period, beginning of ‘46?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: Well, ‘40, no it was probably the middle -- was -- I don’t remember, was VE Day in May ‘45?</span> <span id="s247">I think --</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: I don’t remember the day [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: I believe it was.</span> <span id="s250">And -- And that we still had in Lvov, so it was probably in -- somewhere in the -- and I remember going -- it was in the spring that we went, so it was probably the end of May of ‘45 that we went westward.</span> <span id="s251">And the place we went to was a town by the name of Bittum.</span> <span id="s252">Now Bittum is in western Poland and actually is just a tram car -- street car’s ride away from Katowice.</span> <span id="s253">So I came back to where I had been.</span> <span id="s254">And in fact, I had had relatives in Bittum who -- who had lived, before the war, in Bittum, were very wealthy people, owned a factory there, but none of them survived, all the descendants.</span> <span id="s255">But we went to Bittum because the other family that I had mentioned, the Frosts, with whom my brother was still -- he was still with them at that time, had gone to Bittum, and -- and so we went there thinking we would try to settle there, at least for awhile.</span> <span id="s256">The idea always was to come to the United States.</span> <span id="s257">Mother had actually registered to come to the United States before the war, but her number hadn’t come up.</span> <span id="s258">So she was still hopeful that she was in line, in terms of the numbers and that eventually that number would come up and that we would be able to come to the United States.</span> <span id="s259">We went to Bittum and I started going to school, but it became dangerous -- not became, but it still was dangerous for Jews to be identified as Jews and the Kelsa program is of course, one manifestation which occurred later, but one manifestation of that.</span> <span id="s260">So, i-it wasn’t good to be a Greek Catholic, which would have been natural, because we were now in western Poland.</span> <span id="s261">So, I went to school now, and -- as a Roman Catholic and my name became Leslef Kusharetsky, because it was impo -- for me to have told anyone I was Jewish, would have been very bad for me.</span> <span id="s262">So -- So I became a Roman Catholic at this time, not that I was baptized or anything, but as far as my schoolmates were concerned, and my name was Leslef Kusharetsky.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: Now, did you have any experiences, either in Lvov or in your new home.</span> <span id="s264">You -- You mentioned you -- you ha -- you were faced with having to deny your identity and change your name, which is obviously a -- a drastic and a necessary thing to do.</span> <span id="s265">But did you -- did you -- were there times where you experienced personally, anti-Semitism in the post-war period in Poland yourself, or -- how else did you see it?</span> <span id="s266">Was it just all around you, what -- what’s happened in places --</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: You know, anti-Semitism is -- is very relative.</span> <span id="s268">We had just gone through the worst anti-Semitism there is, where we saw people being dragged through the streets by their beards and shot and killed.</span> <span id="s269">So, anything that occurred, the fact that someone would throw a stone at -- would call a name, was so minuscule.</span> <span id="s270">So, you know, the Russians to us, were the liberators.</span> <span id="s271">They were our friends, they were the people who defeated Hitler and so there was enormous amount of -- you know, they evoked a positive image in our minds.</span> <span id="s272">There was a lot of anti-Semitism around, but it was -- it was a -- it was as natural as breathing and it was so minuscule compared to what had just happened that it really was insignificant.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: It did-didn’t reach you --</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: -- in that sense.</span> <span id="s276">I remember reading in one o -- some of the literature, I don’t know if it was from the encyclopedia of the Holocaust or where, but there was reference to the -- the sentiment just among the citizenry in Poland that u-upon greeting a Jew, somebody would often say, “Oh, I thought -- I thought the -- the Germans got rid of you all,” or something to --</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s278">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: Was -- Was it -- Wh-What -- Was the atmosphere on that level of -- of hatred --</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: -- and dehumanization?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: Absolutely, absolutely.</span> <span id="s283">But again, you know, it’s -- it’s -- it -- one should not generalize.</span> <span id="s284">There were good people.</span> <span id="s285">And -- But -- But there was hatred and there was -- and -- and you know the fear?</span> <span id="s286">Don’t forget that a lot of the Poles were living in Jewish homes and eating from Jewish dishes and their fear was someone was going to come back and reclaim it.</span> <span id="s287">A-And the fear toda -- to this day is someone’s going to come back and reclaim it.</span> <span id="s288">So, you know, th-there was a lot of anti-Semitism, but again, relative to what we had gone through, it was quite mild.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: So then, you’re -- you’re -- by mid -- middle of the year in ‘45, you’re now in western Poland, and -- and how long did you stay there?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: Well, we -- we -- again, we had difficulty making a living and -- and one of the things that everyone was doing was buying and selling and you’d go to the market and you would stand a-and you would see something -- with a few do -- few zlotys, and you would see something and you’d buy it and then you’d move two steps further and you’d try to sell it.</span> <span id="s291">And I remember one amusing incident was that we once bought what we thought was a lovely pair of shoes for very little money and when we looked at our most magnificent find, we found that we had been sold two left shoes.</span> <span id="s292">And here we were, having spent a fair amount of whatever we had on these shoes, hoping to make a good profit and here we had two left shoes.</span> <span id="s293">So, the question then was, how could we sell two left shoes?</span> <span id="s294">And the feeling was that a child would more likely get away with it than an adult.</span> <span id="s295">So my brother ended up selling the two left shoes to some other poor sucker, who thought he or she had gotten a bargain.</span> <span id="s296">But that’s the way life went, you know and -- and -- and so on.</span> <span id="s297">But the -- What happened next is that my mother’s parents had lived in Germany and managed to get out of Germany in 1938 and go to England.</span> <span id="s298">And their son and dau -- two daughters, also were in England, s -- and my uncle, their son, they lived in Newcastle on Thames and in -- immediately at the end of the war, they began making inquiries about our family and found out that the children had survived.</span> <span id="s299">So they petitioned the religious council of England, th-the chief rabbi at that time was Rabbi Hertz, to try to get us to rejoin them.</span> <span id="s300">And there was a Rabbi Solomon Shunfeld, who was a strikingly handsome gentleman, with a red beard.</span> <span id="s301">He worked for the United Nations at that point -- for the UNRRA, the relief organization.</span> <span id="s302">He fashioned himself a uniform, which was a British uniform with a -- with a leather strap across his chest and -- and looked very, very elegant.</span> <span id="s303">And he basically made trips on behalf of the religious -- the chief rabbi’s religious council of England, to Poland, in order to find Jews who had survived, to help them, to try to get children and see whether he could transport them to England, get permission, and they were able to get a certain number of visas from the British government.</span> <span id="s304">And so my uncle approached them to find us and -- and he in fact did and I remember when he came to -- to Bittum -- and that was in 1945, probably mid or late ‘45, to inform us that we had grandparents and uncle and two aunts and that they were anxious to get us to England.</span> <span id="s305">And my brother said, “Great.”</span> <span id="s306">And I said, “I won’t go without Mother.”</span> <span id="s307">And they had no permission for a visa for an adult, to they had a problem.</span> <span id="s308">They wired my uncle and my uncle said he wasn’t ready to bring anyone else, but he wanted us, so they tried again.</span> <span id="s309">And I told him in no uncertain terms that there is absolutely no way in which they will get me into any kind of vehicle alive, and -- to go to England.</span> <span id="s310">So, he wired back saying that he would not participate -- he would not do that.</span> <span id="s311">And finally they got a visa for Mother.</span> <span id="s312">So, in the very end of 1945, I think it was December the 31st, of 1945, we left -- well, we first went from Bittum to Warsaw, stayed with Rabbi Kahana, who was -- then lived in Warsaw and every day we would go to the airport, because we now had permission to go to England, and every day we would be told that the planes were not flying because it was too foggy.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: Was this true?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: And this wa -- yes, absolutely, because at that time, radar was in it’s infancy and -- and these were Royal Air Force planes, which were basically troop transports, they weren’t commercial -- you know, they had canvas seats and they basically transported troops.</span> <span id="s315">But they were willing to transport us.</span> <span id="s316">And -- So, for about two weeks, there became a standing joke, we would go in the morning to the airport, we’d be back in the afternoon and then finally one day we went and we took off and we went to Berlin and then from Berlin, flew to London, where we were met by my aunt, and then took a train to Newcastle.</span> <span id="s317">And we remained in Newcastle for the next -- well, in England for three and a half years.</span> <span id="s318">Oh, when we -- originally they gave us a visa which was valid for one month’s visit.</span> <span id="s319">But our Polish passport, which I still had, states that it’s valid only one way, so, I’m not sure how that worked.</span> <span id="s320">But when we came to the airport, the official said to us, “You only want to visit England for one month?”</span> <span id="s321">And we said, “Well, we’d like to visit for a lot more, but we’re only allowed one month.”</span> <span id="s322">So he crossed out one month and he put three months.</span> <span id="s323">And I still have that document.</span> <span id="s324">And so every three months, we had to renew our stay in England and we did that for three and a half years, until our number came up to come to the United States.</span> <span id="s325">So this was now 1946, I was 11 years old and I came to England, to Newcastle, and started going to school there and I didn’t know a word of English and I had to learn another language and then --</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: Which would have been your -- how many languages now, by the --</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: Well, my native was -- was German and then Polish and then of course during the war, Ukrainian and then after the war, Russian.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: Ukrainian and Russian are quite similar?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: Very.</span> <span id="s330">They’re both Slavic language, but -- and they’re both written in a Cyrillic alphabet, but they’re are significant differences between the two.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: So you -- you were at your fifth language by 11 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: So -- Right, so I had to learn English and unfortunately England had a terrible system at that time, which they have since done away with.</span> <span id="s333">And that is that they had an exam called the elevenses.</span> <span id="s334">When you were eleven years old, you took an exam and if you passed it, if you got above a certain grade, you were destined to go to a university.</span> <span id="s335">And if you got below a certain grade, you were destined to finish your education at the age of 14 and to the factory.</span> <span id="s336">And I arrived there just before my 11th birthday.</span> <span id="s337">And so, I took my elevenses, not knowing how to read one word, and of course got zero.</span> <span id="s338">And so, I was placed in a school that would have ended at the age of 14, in a factory.</span> <span id="s339">But, again, Mother had other ideas and -- and in 1948, she left Newcastle with me and we went to London and she got a job as a maid in a home on Goldessgreen Road and enrolled me in a Jewish secondary school, because you could avoid that whole system if you went into a private school.</span> <span id="s340">And so from ‘48 to ‘49, I went for the first time, to a Jewish school and got a little bit of a beginnings of a Jewish education at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: Let me ask you, as -- as we’re moving forward in time and -- and it -- and it’s getting a little bit further away from the horribly traumatic experiences that you’d had during the war, and you’re getting older at the same time, at this point are you beginning to feel certain things, remember certain things, realize the -- the depth of -- of tragedy of what had happened to your family and -- and -- and to you personally, or -- or was this -- or were you just sort of going on in life and moving forward and you’re living another life and going ahead?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: I think a little bit of both.</span> <span id="s343">I think, you know, our world was a world which was not normal, because the people, all of our acquaintances were refugees.</span> <span id="s344">People who -- who had been lawyers and professors in Poland and now were doormen and -- and -- and janitors.</span> <span id="s345">It was a world in which the topic of conversation was dominated by what was and what was lost.</span> <span id="s346">So it -- So that was always, I think cloud that -- that was there.</span> <span id="s347">Whenever -- I don’t remember one day that it, you know, became, but certainly, as I think back on my teenage years in this country and so on and later on, I never was the same as other kids.</span> <span id="s348">I could never let myself go, I was always separated, by my own volition.</span> <span id="s349">I could never participate in -- in something pleasurable for it’s own sake.</span> <span id="s350">It had to have an ulterior purpose, it had to have -- there was always that serious element to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: To have a certain usefulness?</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: It had to have a certain usefulness, I had to -- I was constantly aware that I had a responsibility, that my life wasn’t fully my own, that I had to fulfill certain responsibilities.</span> <span id="s353">At the same time, I must tell you also, that it -- it -- my past experiences have been of enormous help to me.</span> <span id="s354">And no matter what crisis I faced afterwards, I would always say to myself, “Well, there’s nothing to this.”</span> <span id="s355">It’s a piece of cake, right?</span> <span id="s356">So -- So, from that point of view, everything always compared itself and -- and so from -- so it was helpful, but there’s no -- End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: Well, you were talking about how -- how this has been helpful for you to be able to tap into -- tap into this knowledge that, you know, everything that’s a challenge from now on, is nothing, compared to what you’ve been through.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: Yeah, I think that everything always gets compared to that and no matter what crisis may arise, it -- it pales to insignificance when compared to what one has already been through, so you can always say to yourself, “Well, if I’ve gone through the worst, I can get through this.”</span> <span id="s359">And -- And so no crisis seemed as great, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: Now you’re -- you were just mentioning that you felt -- now, if you’re getting into ‘48 and ‘49, you’re 13 - 14 years old, a -- a sense o-o-of -- of not being able to do something fun for fun’s sake, or joyful for joyfulness’ sake, that you had a sense of responsibility.</span> <span id="s361">What -- What was that responsibility to?</span> <span id="s362">Was it to a thing, to an idea, to a person, to yourself?</span> <span id="s363">What was it to?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: Well, I am not sure that I articulated it that carefully at that age.</span> <span id="s365">I can only talk about the results.</span> <span id="s366">Obviously, I’ve articulated it more clearly in my mind since then, but to be fair about it, at that age, I didn’t.</span> <span id="s367">But again, to get -- I’ll get back to your question in a minute, but to get back to those days when I went to the Jewish secondary school, to the [indecipherable] grammar school, I lived in a dormitory -- and this was from ‘48 to ‘49, and every youngster in that dormitory that I lived in, was a survivor.</span> <span id="s368">And every -- just about every youngster was without parents.</span> <span id="s369">And so it was a -- again, a peculiar atmosphere that one was in, so the -- the -- the thing continued.</span> <span id="s370">You’re never very far from it and w-was during wa -- those years that one of my -- my very first girlfriend that I had a crush on, unfortunately committed suicide.</span> <span id="s371">And so there were people with a lot of problems, a lot of unhappiness.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: Despair --</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: And I was very fortunate among them, because I had -- I had an anchor, which they did not, which -- which was of tremendous help.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: What -- What -- What do you recall about when this girl took her life.</span> <span id="s375">Your -- Your own feelings -- was it -- was it -- was it despair for her, just utter despair?</span> <span id="s376">Or do you --</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: I -- I think it was despair for her and -- and as far as my own feelings, I was, of course, very sad to lose a friend and sad that it occurred at that point.</span> <span id="s378">But my attitude was, if that’s what she needed to do, that’s what she needed to do.</span> <span id="s379">And it wasn’t -- a-again, you know, coming from an environment so surrounded by death, it -- it -- it -- it was one more and the -- the war didn’t end in 1945, it continued.</span> <span id="s380">And it continued to claim it’s victims.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: So this anchor for you is just so -- just so important.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: Was terribly important, and again, as I said before, I attribute all of my good fortune to that and then what I’ve been able to do, yeah.</span> <span id="s383">But you asked me before, in terms of -- of responsibility to whom, and of course, that, I think, probably changes as your age changes and as your perspective changes.</span> <span id="s384">I don’t think you make a decision for life and then you stick with it, I think it -- it changes.</span> <span id="s385">But it was always a sense of responsibility, but I owed it to Mother, I owed to make something of myself, it was never th -- it was unthinkable that I would not achieve something, in some field.</span> <span id="s386">So I had that responsibility.</span> <span id="s387">I felt a -- a very keen sense of responsibility to my parents.</span> <span id="s388">I felt that when I came to the United States, I felt I needed to delve more into -- into Jewish learning, in order to learn what motivated them and -- and it became important for me to have children and grandchildren.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: Did you, at any point, feel -- in talking to -- to other people, I’ve heard before and there’s a -- you know th-they use the terminology which I th-think sometimes it -- you boil things down to -- to too simplistic when you use terms that people use, term survivors guilt or the sense that wh-why, you know, I’ve talked to people, why did I survive?</span> <span id="s390">Even if you can intellectually understand the circumstances in which you survived.</span> <span id="s391">Was there any of that, or -- or -- a-as you -- as you looked at it?</span> <span id="s392">I ma -- I’m not -- I’m not hearing you say that, but I’m wondering whether you sa -- had a sense of like, how could all these other people perish and -- and -- and I’m here?</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: Well, there is that question in terms of what makes the world go around and -- and the how come and tha -- there no -- no question that these questions occur to you.</span> <span id="s394">I’ve never interpreted these as being guilt, certainly it -- it could be, that on unconscious level, there is guilt.</span> <span id="s395">But I’ve never felt, on a conscious level, particularly guilty.</span> <span id="s396">I felt -- I felt blessed and lucky.</span> <span id="s397">But I don’t think -- I don’t think guilty.</span> <span id="s398">I don’t -- I don’t feel that.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: So, well, there are so many -- so many strains of your story, that --</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: -- that -- that are so fascinating and -- and -- and powerful.</span> <span id="s402">Guess I’d like to ask you to go back now to -- we’re in -- in London, right, in -- in ‘48 - ‘49, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: ‘48 - ‘49, right, we left Newcastle in ‘40 -- yeah, ‘48.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: And what’s London like?</span> <span id="s405">Wh-What do you remember from it?</span> <span id="s406">You’re getting to be a teenager now.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: Right.</span> <span id="s408">Well, I didn’t take that much advantage of London as a city.</span> <span id="s409">You know, it’s of course, a wonderful city and we did go to museums and so on as a -- on school outings, but Mother, as I mentioned, worked as a maid.</span> <span id="s410">Worked for a family by the name of Bodner, on Goldessgreen Road and -- and she was constantly working, so she had no time and -- and certainly no extra money to do anything with and she spent on my schooling and whatever extras.</span> <span id="s411">But we would go to the movies and so on, but most of my life revolved around the dormitory where I lived and taking the bus to school and coming from school and doing homework and the usual types of things.</span> <span id="s412">We -- At that time, we still had ration books in England and I remember people were always complaining about the rationing of food and -- and -- and to us, when I say to us, I mean in -- in the dormitory and so on, we always thought it was rather amusing, because we thought that th-this wasn’t a shortage, this wasn’t deprivation in any way.</span> <span id="s413">But -- But we did have ration books and -- and yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: So, now you -- you’re still in a -- in a kind of a lottery or a waiting line, to -- to --</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: -- to get to the United States.</span> <span id="s417">What was that process like, waiting?</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: Ah, well --</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: [indecipherable] terms of the procedure as well as the feeling of -- of waiting?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: Well, it was a -- a being in limbo, basically, and -- and not being able to get on with your life, because every three months you had to go to the Home Office and plead for another three months extension of your visa, or another six months extension of your visa.</span> <span id="s421">Mother was not allowed to work, that was one of the conditions of the visa.</span> <span id="s422">So that had to be done surreptitiously.</span> <span id="s423">And so -- so, there was a certain degree of discomfort, but -- but even though this was a rather mild getting around the government regulations, compared to others, so that wasn’t much of a problem.</span> <span id="s424">But you sort of had a feeling that you were in limbo, waiting for something, and that you really weren’t going to ge -- get on with your life until that number came up, which it finally did and we left in June of 1949.</span> <span id="s425">Now, I must mention that my brother had also gone to that school, but before me.</span> <span id="s426">And then in 1948, I was walking with him on the street one day in London, and -- and he said to me, “I will share something with you, but you mustn’t tell anyone.”</span> <span id="s427">And I said, “Okay.”</span> <span id="s428">And he said, “I’m leaving next week.”</span> <span id="s429">And I said, “Where are you leaving to?”</span> <span id="s430">And he said, “Guess.”</span> <span id="s431">And I said, “Is it to Asia?”</span> <span id="s432">And he looked at me and I said, “Asia Minor?”</span> <span id="s433">As it was known at that time.</span> <span id="s434">I said, “Palestine?”</span> <span id="s435">Shh.</span> <span id="s436">And indeed he took an illegal boat from France and went to Palestine and participated in the various wars there, worked in a lot of different professions and then was sent out in the embassy to Europe in 1956, and in 1956 decided that he had had enough of politics and international relations and everything else, and he went back to school and got a degree in physics and he got a -- came to the United States and got a Bachelors, a Masters and a Doctorate in physics and then went to teach in Australia, but -- from England -- so we -- we came to England together, but almost immediately when we came to Newcastle, he went to London to school, and I stayed in Newcastle.</span> <span id="s437">And then when I came to London, he had left for Palestine.</span> <span id="s438">So we really never had -- were together very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: Did you -- Did you miss each other, or -- speaking for yourself, I mean, especially after having lost your parents, did you feel like I -- you wanted to be with him, or was it -- was --</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: I -- I did.</span> <span id="s441">I always, you know, admired him a great deal.</span> <span id="s442">He is a -- was and is an exceptional person in terms of his -- extremely bright individual, with a -- with a tremendous depth of knowledge of all sorts of esoteric fields.</span> <span id="s443">He developed a computer program for writing Chinese and in fact that we were in China a few years ago, I was there as a visiting professor and -- and he was there trying to market his Chinese computer.</span> <span id="s444">And so we were sitting in Beijing, over a bottle of plum wine and -- and we were reminiscing and we were saying, “Isn’t it strange, here is a Polish Jew from Israel, trying to teach the Chinese how to write.</span> <span id="s445">So, I’ve always admired him very much, but -- but he has always borne a tremendous burden and -- and never -- has never been able to make peace with himself or the world, and I’ve always felt very deeply for him, because of that.</span> <span id="s446">So, I understand him, and yet I don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: Do you se -- When’s the last time you’ve seen him?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: He was here just a few years ago and he was supposed to come again this fall, but couldn’t and he’s thinking now of coming in the spring.</span> <span id="s449">So, every few years, we see each other for a few days.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: Do you -- Do you get to -- Have you ever been to Australia to see him?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: No, we have not.</span> <span id="s452">We have not.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s454">Oh that’s -- that’s a story of -- all in itself, isn’t it --</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: -- it so -- sounds like movie, the two of you sitting there --</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: -- having the plum wine in -- in Beijing, it really does.</span> <span id="s459">So -- So now, when the -- when the number -- when -- do you remember the day that th-the number came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: Oh yes, yes, very --</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: Tell me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: -- very much.</span> <span id="s463">Well, we -- we -- my mother called me to tell me that she had gotten a letter from the US embassy and that we had to go in for physicals.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: Did she know what that meant?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: Yes, oh yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: She pretty excited?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: -- but that we -- but that we had, finally, the number and that was a very, very big thing, we were very excited, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: Did you -- Did you cele -- Did you go out and celebrate, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: I don’t think so, because I don’t -- we had no money.</span> <span id="s470">I think our big problem was we -- we just had no spare money whatsoever, and -- and so -- Mother was making, I think, I don’t remember, two or three pounds a week, or -- there was never any spare money.</span> <span id="s471">So, we -- But I do remember we were terribly, terribly happy and unfortunately, my uncle died just at that time.</span> <span id="s472">He had had an asthma attack and at the age of 34, died.</span> <span id="s473">So -- So that was a sad event and see, that was just before we left.</span> <span id="s474">And we left and I was also very excited because we were going to go to the United States on the Queen Elizabeth, that was the Queen Elizabeth number one, not number two.</span> <span id="s475">And we arrived here, on June the 13th of 1949.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: June the 13th, 1949, do -- so, can you -- can you bring us onto the ship and -- and -- and what do you recall of actually boarding?</span> <span id="s477">Were you st --</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: Well, the ship was -- oh, the ship was very exciting.</span> <span id="s479">Of course, I was -- I was 13 years or 14 years old and -- and -- and to any 14 year old, to make an Atlantic crossing on the Queen Elizabeth, a very, very exciting event and we -- I know one thing that did occur was on the morning of when we arrived in New York harbor, I was -- must have been up at four in the morning or maybe three, and I was on board and everyone was there, waiting for the Statue of Liberty to come into view.</span> <span id="s480">And at just about daybreak and we were still a little further -- far away, so I couldn’t see it.</span> <span id="s481">Up came someone and said that the morning prayers were being said and they needed a 10th man.</span> <span id="s482">So I went down for the morning prayers, to the chapel.</span> <span id="s483">Someone had the -- to say Kaddish, so there I was and I missed the Statue of Liberty by the time I came up.</span> <span id="s484">We had passed it, so -- so --</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: You must have been crushed.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: But -- But anyhow, we landed and it was Flag Day.</span> <span id="s487">A gentleman came up who was selling flags, he pinned a little flag on my lapel and waited for some money.</span> <span id="s488">I had no idea how much to give him, but in England, you could buy a loaf of bread for a penny farthing, which was a penny and a quarter.</span> <span id="s489">So, a penny was a fair amount of money, so I thought that would be good.</span> <span id="s490">So I gave him a penny and I heard a string of curse words as only a New Yorker can use.</span> <span id="s491">That was my introduction to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: So -- So you had a -- a rude introduction to the United States of America?</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: A rude, rude introduction.</span> <span id="s494">Now, I must tell you, that as you know, when one used to be able -- when one got a number to come to the United States, it was based on the fact that someone in the United States had filled out an affidavit sponsoring you.</span> <span id="s495">The person who filled out an affidavit was Mother’s half-sister.</span> <span id="s496">And so we arrived, and arrived at the port, and found no one waiting for us.</span> <span id="s497">So everyone -- we were waiting at the port and everyone dispersed, everyone disembarked and we were left alone.</span> <span id="s498">Of course, speaking the language well, but otherwise strangers in New York port.</span> <span id="s499">And we were amazed that no one approached us.</span> <span id="s500">So we went over the to the HIAS desk --</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: The -- The what desk?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: HIAS.</span> <span id="s503">The Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, which was a wonderful, old organization which has helped for many, many decades, Jewish immigrants to this country.</span> <span id="s504">And they got us a cab and we got in the cab and I think we may have had three suitcases, maybe four, but not -- not more than that, with all of our possessions.</span> <span id="s505">And we came to -- near King’s highway in Brooklyn, on 34th Street and found the address of Mother’s half-sister and rang the doorbell and she came to the door, looked down and said, “So many suitcases?</span> <span id="s506">Where am I going to put all of this?”</span> <span id="s507">So that was the greeting and it portended not a very good future.</span> <span id="s508">That evening, she decided that she would take us and show us Brooklyn and she took us to Pitkin Avenue.</span> <span id="s509">And she thought that we would be oohing and aahing at the neon lights and so on and when we didn’t express any exhilaration, having just come from London and she was very upset.</span> <span id="s510">She also informed me in no uncertain terms, tha -- in the United States, we don’t speak the way I did, because I had a thick English accent.</span> <span id="s511">That we say, toity toid street and not 33rd Street.</span> <span id="s512">And we stayed there for about three days and then it was quite clear that we were not welcome.</span> <span id="s513">We were very grateful for the affidavit, but it was clear we were not welcome there.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s515">Tell me the address again, th-th-the --</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: It was on King’s Highway, I think on 35th Street -- 34th or 35th Street.</span> <span id="s517">34th, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: So this is Queens?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: No, Brooklyn.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: Oh, King’s Highway, okay, Brooklyn.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: In Brooklyn.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: In Brooklyn.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: And what part of Brooklyn would this be, if it --</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: Wait a minute.</span> <span id="s526">East, no, it was 34 East 58th Street.</span> <span id="s527">That’s what it was, 58.</span> <span id="s528">East 58th Street.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: In -- In Brooklyn.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: In Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s531">And, at any rate, we -- we left there after about three days, got in touch with HIAS and HIAS was kind enough to put us up at a transient hotel, which was called the East Broadway Central Hotel, down on the Lower East Side.</span> <span id="s532">A very meager, transient hotel.</span> <span id="s533">And then we managed to get a room on West 102nd Street.</span> <span id="s534">One room for Mother and me.</span> <span id="s535">And she managed to arrange a cour -- to take a course in baby nursing.</span> <span id="s536">Her idea was that every mother who comes home, needs someone to take care of the baby for a week or two and so she would take this course and -- and be able to find work, which she did.</span> <span id="s537">After a six week course, she found work and she would work for 30 hours a day and then have four hours off.</span> <span id="s538">And so she worked very, very hard.</span> <span id="s539">In the meantime, I -- this was in June, so it was at the beginning of the summer.</span> <span id="s540">It was a very hot summer in -- in New York.</span> <span id="s541">I had never experienced heat like that.</span> <span id="s542">But someone had told me about a school in New York called Yeshiva University, where I could get both a general and a Hebrew -- a thorough Hebrew education.</span> <span id="s543">So, I took a subway, went up to Yeshiva University and pleaded my case with the admissions office.</span> <span id="s544">They asked me what my background had been, what I knew, whether I knew any Hebrew, and I didn’t.</span> <span id="s545">I had had that one year in London, which barely I was able to read, but that’s about it.</span> <span id="s546">And they told me they didn’t see how I could possibly keep up, that all their students had had eight years of thorough Hebrew education, that the language of instruction in the Hebrew department was in Hebrew and they didn’t think I could -- I could manage it, so -- but finally they decided to give me some books and si -- told me to take these books and study them, and come back in September and we’ll see what we can do.</span> <span id="s547">So, I took them home and there was absolutely no way, I -- I couldn’t make heads or tails out of them.</span> <span id="s548">I used to sit and try and it was very hard, I was really very discouraged.</span> <span id="s549">Came back in September and fortunately the registrar of the teacher’s institute of Yeshiva University, Dr. Greenstein took pity on me and said, “Well, why don’t we try you.”</span> <span id="s550">And -- And so I started in the lowest grade -- in their lowest grade, where everyone was already speaking Hebrew.</span> <span id="s551">And I remember my first word that I learned, that I could understand and -- and I spent the next six years at Yeshiva University.</span> <span id="s552">I graduated their high school at 16 and then their college at 20 and at 20 also received a Hebrew teacher’s diploma, and a diploma from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in proficiency in the Hebrew language, and learned Yiddish and -- and received a Bachelor of Hebrew literature, as well as a Bachelor of Arts, before I went to medical school.</span> <span id="s553">So, it’s possible.</span> <span id="s554">Yeshiva University was incredibly kind to me.</span> <span id="s555">I had a difficult time there, I won’t say it was easy, I had a difficult time, but -- but Yeshiva University gave me a scholarship.</span> <span id="s556">They provided me with a card which was worth eight dollars per week, through which I could eat.</span> <span id="s557">And they would, from a financial point of view, in terms of financial help, they were -- I -- I really couldn’t have gotten that kind of education if they weren’t around, so I’m very, very grateful to them and to President Velkin, who was always very kind to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: So there were some real organizations and institutions that -- that gave a real helping hand to you [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: No question, no question, HIAS, with all of it’s faults and problems, and there were many, was -- was tremendously helpful and -- and as I said, Yeshiva University.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: Are there other groups or -- of -- especially as you’re trying to get on your feet in those first months?</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: I think those were the two that really helped us most, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: I’m also wondering what -- if you have any particular memories of those early days of -- whether it revolved around -- I don’t know if y -- if you perhaps brought anything with you, you know, mementos of -- of -- that you brought with you, things to remember, or -- or whether there was specific things that -- that happened on the streets, that -- that you recall, in those first days?</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: Well, in terms of mementos, yes, of course, I brought a number of things.</span> <span id="s564">From the war, I brought my blanket, but I was busy really building a future and not dwelling that much.</span> <span id="s565">The past was always there, but I wasn’t dwelling on it.</span> <span id="s566">I also brought a little book that I had borrowed from the library in Univ and never returned, and I still have to this day.</span> <span id="s567">I don’t know what the overdue charge for that [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: Pretty far up there.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: And I also have a handkerchief which my father gave me when he left me at the monastery, cause I started crying and he gave me a handkerchief.</span> <span id="s570">And that’s about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: And you carried those things with you in New York?</span> <span id="s572">You have them at home, anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, and a few photograph.</span> <span id="s574">But, in terms of the early days, no, I think it was a -- a lonely existence, because I really didn’t -- I didn’t -- I didn’t really fit in, in many ways.</span> <span id="s575">My accent was strange, I had a British accent.</span> <span id="s576">Didn’t know anything about baseball, didn’t know anything about American football.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: Well, were they strange sports to you, did you -- you just didn’t connect with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: They were -- They were strange sports to me.</span> <span id="s579">I had learned a little bit about soccer, but even that was strange.</span> <span id="s580">I -- I found it very difficult to identify with the idea that someone would run after or hit a ball and then get all excited about it.</span> <span id="s581">I mean, that just didn’t seem to me to be the essence of life.</span> <span id="s582">And I -- And I -- I could never participate in any of these activities, I just thought they were silly.</span> <span id="s583">And so -- so I really was -- I really, I think, I felt myself different.</span> <span id="s584">Fortunately, at Yeshiva University, there were a number of young people who came from Europe and we formed sort of a clique.</span> <span id="s585">And there were a number of Israelis who were strangers here.</span> <span id="s586">There were a number of people from South America who were strangers, so there was this -- there wa -- there were a number of people who felt themselves alienated or strange in the environment.</span> <span id="s587">But my purpose was to learn, and I did and -- and -- and that’s the important thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: Okay, I’ll just switch.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: So, you didn’t -- you described it, in a way, those years, of being quite lonely and yet, you did make some other friends, that -- did you feel sort of ou-ou-outsider in those first years?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: I was an outsider, no question, I was an outsider.</span> <span id="s592">I never had -- I didn’t have -- I had one close friend, who was from Costa Rica.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: At Yeshiva?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: At Yeshiva.</span> <span id="s595">And I had one close friend, who has since died, who was also from Europe, but I really didn’t have close friendships.</span> <span id="s596">I never -- I, for instance marvel at the fact that in the six years -- I came from Europe and in the six years that I was at YU, I -- I never saw the inside of a home.</span> <span id="s597">I was never invited to anybody’s house.</span> <span id="s598">I never -- was never anywhere for a meal.</span> <span id="s599">I had no -- A-And part of it may have been my fault, I don’t know, maybe I kept myself at arm’s length, but that’s the -- that’s the fact.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s601">D-Did you feel that -- well, I guess one -- one thing that just occurred to me was -- I mean, did anybody know what you had been through in any sense?</span> <span id="s602">Did you talk about it at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: I -- I didn’t make a secret of it, but I also didn’t advertise it.</span> <span id="s604">But I was -- I said I was busy with the future, not the past.</span> <span id="s605">I think people knew, more or less, but you know, it wasn’t that unusual.</span> <span id="s606">I mean, New York was full of refugees in 1949, and people weren’t interested in what we went through.</span> <span id="s607">I think now people are interested, but in those days, people weren’t interested.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: And why is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s610">I -- I think the mood has changed.</span> <span id="s611">I think that, you know, again, when something is very prevalent -- now, you know, I’m one of the youngest of the so-called survivors.</span> <span id="s612">The people are, you know, leaving this world and passing on and th -- becoming less frequent, so everyone’s trying to get the story down on tape and so on.</span> <span id="s613">But when everyone is -- around you is somehow connected with it, it’s not that unusual.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: [indecipherable] yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: And -- And so, i-it wasn’t, you know, it wasn’t -- as I said, I -- I never tried to hide it, but at the same I never made an issue of it.</span> <span id="s616">My purpose was to move forward.</span> <span id="s617">It’s only as you get older that you begin to look back.</span> <span id="s618">When you’re young, it’s full steam ahead and you got to build a future and you’ve got to -- you know, you’ve got things to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: I wonder also, if there was something at the time, and I re-recall -- I can’t remember who in Israel has written about this, it might be this fellow Tom Segev --</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: -- who wrote a book called, “The Seventh Million.”</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: Seventh Million</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: I was interviewing him awhile ago, and I d -- but I don’t recall if it’s him or someone else that talked about th-th-the shift in Israeli society of talking about -- was the Eichmann trial, in terms of publicly acknowledging and -- and -- and to some commentators minds, it was sort of an end of shame about it, also.</span> <span id="s624">Now, I don’t know -- do you think that there were elements like this going on in the -- in the --</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: -- in the subculture of what you were part of in New York, or -- or -- or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: I think there may have been, but -- but I think in Israel, the issue was more complicated, because in Israel, they had their existence to fight for.</span> <span id="s628">They needed heroes, they desperately needed heroes.</span> <span id="s629">And -- And the people who survived the second World War were not looked upon as heroes, they were looked upon as cowards, and as sheep who went to slaughter, this was the public image.</span> <span id="s630">And -- And that’s not what they wanted to transmit to their youth.</span> <span id="s631">They needed power.</span> <span id="s632">I mean, that’s why they transformed this whole thing of Masada, for instance, which when you think about it, Masada is as antithetical to Jewish history as anything ever has been.</span> <span id="s633">The hero of Jewish history was Rabbi Yochanen Ben Zacki, who, when the Romans surrounded Jerusalem and were about to destroy the temple and the nation, had himself snuck out in a coffin, the story has it, with his students following as the mourners, because they would allow coffins and funerals to go outside of Jerusalem, and he went and formed the Yeshiva and basically saved the Judaism, through his academy in Yavna.</span> <span id="s634">That was the hero.</span> <span id="s635">The idea that Jews would lock themselves up in a rock fortress and commit suicide, is a very un-Jewish idea.</span> <span id="s636">The Jewish idea is to sneak out and continue the line.</span> <span id="s637">It’s not to commit suicide.</span> <span id="s638">But Israel needed that at that time.</span> <span id="s639">And people -- we build monuments not to commemorate what occurred, but in order to fulfill the need that we have at that moment.</span> <span id="s640">And Israel needed their paratroopers to go up on Masada.</span> <span id="s641">So, in the same way, Israel needed heroes to fight wars, they didn’t want people who were going to slaughter.</span> <span id="s642">The other thing is that we have, you know, on my observation also, is that there is in -- in survivorship, and I don’t particularly care for that word at all, but we’ll use it, there is a hierarchy of suffering.</span> <span id="s643">And -- And in general, my story, which is fascinating to you, is of no consequence to most quote, unquote survivors [indecipherable] talk to.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: Because?</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: Because, number one, I wasn’t in a concentration camp, and that’s the highest, particularly if you were in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s646">And -- And number two, I was a child and what does a child know?</span> <span id="s647">A child has no feelings, a child doesn’t know anything, a child doesn’t observe the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: Have you ever encountered this in conversations, etcetera?</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: Ta-Talk about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: Oh yes, absolutely, there’s a -- in fact, I am not generally, perhaps that’s the way I look upon myself, too, but I’m not generally considered a survivor.</span> <span id="s652">I know, for instance, when they are making up committees for Holocaust commemoration, I’m not included on those committees.</span> <span id="s653">My English is unaccented, my -- my attitude is -- is different, perhaps, because I -- my education was here.</span> <span id="s654">I don’t -- I don’t fit the mold.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: You don’t seem -- you -- you do evoke bitterness in this?</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: Oh no, heavens, no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: But -- But -- And yet, you have a kind of wry -- wry awareness of this.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: Well, it’s almost amusing to me.</span> <span id="s659">And it’s -- it’s -- it’s an observation of the way life is, there’s no bitterness about it, it doesn’t do anything to me -- for me, one way or the other, but -- but there is this -- this hierarchy, so, in general, you know, people have very little interest in -- in -- it’s only recently that people had a fa -- interest in the children.</span> <span id="s660">That’s a very recent phenomenon and I suspect it’s because the older generation is dying out and -- and also because the quote, unquote, those of us who were children are now getting into an age where we can be taken seriously.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: This is very interesting, the whole -- this sort of internal levels of -- I wouldn’t necessarily quite say politics, but sort of the social structures of remembrance and all --</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: Oh absolutely, there’s a definite social strata.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: Wow, that’s so interesting.</span> <span id="s664">Well now, so, you -- Let me ask you also, and being in New York, I don’t suppose you would have been exposed to the kind of anti-Semitism that -- that other immigrant Holocaust survivors, going to other parts of the country might have been.</span> <span id="s665">Or is that --</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: No, no, no, no, no, no --</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: Th-That wasn’t a phenomenon in New York, I’m sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: -- and in particularly, don’t forget, I went to Yeshiva University, I was -- I was in a Jewish environment, but no, I have experienced no anti-Semitism and I have since then, in -- in medicine, worked with people from many cultures and I have -- I have experienced only the highest respect.</span> <span id="s669">I never had any -- any feelings at all of anti-Semitism that I have detected.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: In -- In America?</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: In America, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: That’s quite a statement.</span> <span id="s673">Well, can you then take us from it -- when you’re at Yeshiva University, at what point did you start getting a sense of -- of what you wanted to be in life, or what professional direction you wanted to take?</span></p> <p><span id="s674">A: Well, I -- I’m not sure I know that, in fact, except that, again the -- the common wisdom among us -- and when I say us, among us immigrants, was A, that the one thing they can’t take away from you is wisdom, or knowledge, so you got to get that.</span> <span id="s675">And number two, that there were certain professions that you cannot transport across geographic boundaries and there are other professions that you can.</span> <span id="s676">I met, as I mentioned previously, a lot of lawyers who were doormen and janitors.</span> <span id="s677">I didn’t meet any physicians who were doormen and janitors.</span> <span id="s678">A physician, not only highly respected, but you can take the job with you wherever you happen to have to go.</span> <span id="s679">And I think in those days, that was an important reason for choosing a profession.</span> <span id="s680">And so -- And maybe my previous experience, my very brief experience at the end of the war, maybe that had something to do with it, I don’t know, but at any rate, I decided that I wanted to become a physician.</span> <span id="s681">Now, it wasn’t a rational decision, because I had in fact, never had a doctor.</span> <span id="s682">Only went to one if I was deathly ill.</span> <span id="s683">I never had any care to -- so to speak, didn’t know any physicians and to tell the truth, had very little idea as to what they did.</span> <span id="s684">But it sounded good, it was safe, seemed like a reasonable thing to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: So you --</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: So I finished YU, and -- and luckily for me, the Einstein College of Medicine was starting in 1955 and I graduated in 1955, and so I applied to the first class of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and was very fortunate in having been accepted there.</span> <span id="s687">And so I went there from ‘55 to ‘59, for four years and then decided to go into pediatrics.</span> <span id="s688">I always liked children, liked the things that I learned in pediatrics in medical school.</span> <span id="s689">And then, after looking around, decided to take my internship and residency at the University of Rochester Medical Center.</span> <span id="s690">And this was very fortunate, both because it gave me a wonderful grounding in -- in medicine and also because I met my wife there, Jean.</span> <span id="s691">She was a secretary in the Department of Pediatrics a-and we met shortly after I came there, and we were married in 1961.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: And -- And during this time, all throughout your schooling, your Mother was [indecipherable] was -- what was she doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: Well, she worked as a baby nurse, as I mentioned and then when that became a little too much for her in terms of the number of hours, she went to a bank and worked as a bookkeeper in a bank.</span> <span id="s694">During my sophomore year in college, she met a Mr. Stark, Mr. Edward Stark, who had been a lawyer in Europe, came to -- and had been a prisoner of war in the pol -- in the Polish army, and came to the United States and went to -- back to school and got a Master’s in social work and worked as a social worker.</span> <span id="s695">And they married in -- when I was a sophomore in -- in college.</span> <span id="s696">So that’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: That would be ‘54?</span></p> <p><span id="s698">A: -- ‘54, yes.</span> <span id="s699">‘53 -- ‘53.</span> <span id="s700">And, so they married, and -- and so I felt more comfortable in terms of leaving for Rochester.</span> <span id="s701">I wanted to get out of New York very much, but I am not sure I would have done that had Mother not had companionship, but I felt more comfortable about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s703">And -- But you stayed quite close after she [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: Oh yes, yes, we -- we -- we remained very close, always remained very close and, you know, I would come back frequently from Rochester and call and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: And this is where the Einstein -- when you say Rochester --</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A: No, this -- Einstein is in the Bronx.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: Oh, Einstein is the Bronx.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: But -- But I graduated Einstein in ‘59 and then went to -- and then went to Rochester afterwards for my internship and residency.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: Ah, I see, okay.</span> <span id="s710">So -- And then how long did you stay there?</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A: In Rochester?</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: Well, I was there for two years, from ‘59 to ‘61.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: And that’s when you met your wife, in sixt --</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: We married in ‘61.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: And then we went to Boston, I was in Boston Children’s for a year.</span> <span id="s718">I wanted to take a year of pathology at Boston Children’s, which I did.</span> <span id="s719">And then in 1962, I owed Uncle Sam two years and I was inducted into the public health service as a Lieutenant Commander in the Coast Guard and we were stationed in Columbus, Ohio, and that’s where our first son was born, was in Columbus, Ohio.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: But you were with the Coast Guard then?</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: Well, the -- I was with the public health service, but the public health service is a branch, technically speaking, of the Coast Guard.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: Oh, I never knew that.</span> <span id="s723">Is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: Yeah, the -- the ranking is the Coast Guard ranking, I don’t know why.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: Oh, oh, in terms of the military service.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: So -- And you were in Columbus then, from what?</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A: ‘62 to ‘64.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: And then, by that time I decided that I wanted to specialize in pediatric cardiology and so I went back to Rochester -- we went back to Rochester now, with our first child and while there, our s -- daughter was born and we were in Rochester from ‘64 to ‘67, and then in ‘67, came to Hartford to become -- to develop pediatric cardiology, really, at Hartford Hospital, in the University of Connecticut, when they arrived a year later and most recently at the Children’s Hospital, Connecticut Children’s Hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: Mm-hm, so that’s been a good deal of your life’s work is -- in the last 30 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: Has been in -- in Hartford.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: And so you’ve been developing, really developing this field, that it sounds like.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: Yes, I -- I -- I was very, very fortunate, I -- I was fortunate because I got a chance to -- something very few people get, I -- I got a chance to come into a community that didn’t have a service, to develop it, to bring others in and to provide a -- a service, really, for northern Connecticut and western Massachusetts.</span> <span id="s739">During this time also, I was fortunate in -- in being able to work for the Heart Association as a volunteer and I did a lot of committee work for them, chairing a lot of committees.</span> <span id="s740">And it was my committee that developed the standards and the courses for c -- child -- children’s CPR.</span> <span id="s741">And these have become standard throughout the country and throughout the world, as a matter of fact.</span> <span id="s742">And -- And that has brought us a large number of invitations to speak all over the world, and that’s why I was in China, when I mentioned -- when I met my brother.</span> <span id="s743">But we were also -- traveled very extensively throughout the world and lecturing and so it -- I’ve had a -- a wonderful, wonderful career, been very pleased with and proud that I’ve been able to make a contribution to the welfare of children and to the welfare of our community.</span> <span id="s744">And at the same time, both Jean and I have been very active in the Jewish community here.</span> <span id="s745">Our three children went to the Hebrew academy -- the day school here and we both have been very active on the board and as officers of the school, and continue to do so.</span> <span id="s746">I’ve been on the board of the Jewish Federation.</span> <span id="s747">I was chairman of the commission on Jewish education.</span> <span id="s748">I was president of the historical society and a member of many, many committees within the community.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: I wa -- I want to back up a little bit to ask you when -- when you were married and -- and you and Jean had your -- your son was born first, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: ‘60 --</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: ‘64.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Q: ‘64.</span> <span id="s754">In Columbus?</span></p> <p><span id="s755">A: In Columbus.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: I mean -- I -- I guess this -- this may be a hard question to answer, because the joy of any parent is probably so immeasurable, but I wonder, given your experiences and what you ha -- th-the life that you emerged from and -- and what you took from that experience, how it -- how it perhaps magnified or -- or added or -- or affected somehow, the experience of becoming a father.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: Well, you know, the full effect of it did not hit me until I had grandchildren.</span> <span id="s758">And -- Which is very strange, but that’s the fact.</span> <span id="s759">When I had children, I was still building a career.</span> <span id="s760">I was very, very busy and probably had not fully understood the implications of what occurred.</span> <span id="s761">For instance, my -- our children are not named after anyone who died.</span> <span id="s762">And I can’t tell you why.</span> <span id="s763">But all of our grandchildren are.</span> <span id="s764">So, it’s an interesting phenomenon, and it was my children who chose to do that, not we, of course.</span> <span id="s765">The biggest effect on me, in terms of becoming a father and the biggest difficulty that I had is -- is in being able to identify with what my children were going through.</span> <span id="s766">I had no one, remember -- one learns how to become a parent, primarily, I think by the things that your parents did, and you either emulate them or react against them.</span> <span id="s767">But one way or another, you learn from them.</span> <span id="s768">And I didn’t have that memory and that was a very difficult thing for me.</span> <span id="s769">I didn’t have memory of going to second grade or going to fourth grade.</span> <span id="s770">I never went to those grades.</span> <span id="s771">I couldn’t identify with them going to a ball game or -- or any of the things that -- you know, so I really didn’t -- I wasn’t sure how to do this business.</span> <span id="s772">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: It’s like you didn’t have a childhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: Right, right.</span> <span id="s775">I really never -- had to grow up fast and didn’t have any of that, so I think that was the most difficult part of it, and -- but they all turned out to be wonderful kids and wonderful adults today, so I guess we did something right, mu-muddled through it.</span> <span id="s776">But I think that was the biggest -- biggest problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: Do you think that there are any -- I mean in -- in raising kids, given what happened to you, and -- and the -- the fear that you had to live with, did you ever feel like there were -- and again, this is the kind of thing that’s probably hard to separate, cause every parent is protective --</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q: -- but did you ever feel like you remembered certain things and you -- a-and there’s no way that you would ever allow your child to be exposed to anything dangerous, that sort of thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s780">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s781">I -- I was always a risk taker and -- and I don’t believe that I ever -- at least -- in fact, I would say this, that I bent over backwards -- I worked very hard and very consciously, not to allow my experience to spoil their childhood.</span> <span id="s782">And -- And I probably didn’t tell them as much about things until they were adults, really.</span> <span id="s783">Until they were -- And so, I -- I felt a tremendous sense that, you know, somehow we had this train going on the tracks and the train got derailed and it was my job to put it back on the tracks.</span> <span id="s784">And -- And so I worked very hard with that.</span> <span id="s785">You asked me a question that evoked -- that evoked some thought about I think, certain things or something.</span> <span id="s786">For reasons that I’m sure would come out on a -- on a couch if I ever went to a psychiatrist, but which are probably not that deep, there are certain things today, which I cannot -- I cannot tolerate.</span> <span id="s787">Sudden, loud sounds, flashing lights.</span> <span id="s788">I have gone way out of my way, in an almost pathological fashion, if I hear a balloon being blown up with helium.</span> <span id="s789">That sound, that whistling sound is like the bombs.</span> <span id="s790">And so -- And the same things goes with flashing lights, I have a great deal of trouble with that and I usually try to avoid it.</span> <span id="s791">In fact, I go to a play, even today, and I see a gun coming out of a holster, even on a comedy, I walk out.</span> <span id="s792">I become very tense and then my wife usually says, “Please, let’s go.”</span> <span id="s793">And it’s totally irrational, but there it is.</span> <span id="s794">So, my kids never had balloons.</span> <span id="s795">Never had balloons at a party.</span> <span id="s796">My wife would always see to it that there were no balloons.</span> <span id="s797">So, stupid thing like this, there would be a little thing that would evoke something.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Q: Sirens?</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: No, sirens don’t bother me.</span> <span id="s800">No, sirens don’t bother me.</span> <span id="s801">But it’s primarily that, I was once -- we went to Disney World, I was lecturing and we went to a very fancy restaurant and afterwards they had a light and sound show and everyone was going, so we went along with it.</span> <span id="s802">And it started and I thought I’d never get out of there.</span> <span id="s803">And then I was so grateful when I got out of there.</span> <span id="s804">And -- So I could never take them, for instance, to the Fourth of July fireworks display.</span> <span id="s805">I’d have my wife take them.</span> <span id="s806">So they wouldn’t miss it, but I just could not go to a fireworks display.</span> <span id="s807">So these are the kinds of things that deep down, there is still some fear left.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: Are there conscious -- I mean, obviously this is conscious, what you’re saying, but I’m wondering are there other kinds of -- say when you -- when you dream, do you -- are there certain things that you really remember?</span> <span id="s809">Things that recur?</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: No, no, I never had any -- no, I never had any dreams that I remember th -- the -- particularly, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q: So these are -- more of these are things that are like ordinary or -- or yo -- parts of life that will evoke a reaction --</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: -- less than a conscious kind of --</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Q: -- thing with you, but you know that it’s just -- it’s reminding you in some deep way, of something.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: Better change the tape [indecipherable] time.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s819">Q: Okay, this is tape three.</span> <span id="s820">I wanted to ask you if you’ve ever been back to Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: Yes, we went back, I believe it was in 1991.</span> <span id="s822">But before I tell you that, let me tell you another episode which you just reminded me of.</span> <span id="s823">When I was at Univ, there were two other Jewish children, and I mentioned one of them before, his name today is Oded and I could not remember the name of the other one.</span> <span id="s824">I have a picture of all three of us.</span> <span id="s825">I knew that the -- one of the boys, his name -- I knew his last name was Amirand.</span> <span id="s826">I don’t know why that stuck in my mind, but I knew it was.</span> <span id="s827">And over the years, I always wondered what ever happened to those two youngsters.</span> <span id="s828">I would give anything to be able to connect with them.</span> <span id="s829">And every country I would go to, one of my rituals was to go to the phone book and look at the name of Amirand, and it’s an unusual name, and I never found it.</span> <span id="s830">A few years ago, I was in Tel Aviv, and I had previously looked in the Jerusalem book, but I had not looked in the Tel Aviv book.</span> <span id="s831">And I was in Tel Aviv, and I looked in the book and I found an Adolph Amirand.</span> <span id="s832">So I called the number and an old gentleman answered, and I told him my story.</span> <span id="s833">I told him why I was looking for someone and he said to me, “As you can hear, I’m an old man, I’m 89 years old, but the person you are looking for is my nephew.</span> <span id="s834">He lives in Tel Aviv, he has an unpublished number, but I will give it to you, because I know he wants to hear from you.”</span> <span id="s835">So, I called him immediately and he was very excited to hear from me.</span> <span id="s836">Did not, as it turned out, have that picture at all.</span> <span id="s837">In fact, he was younger than I and had -- his memory was extremely vague, but he did remember me, and we had a wonderful reunion.</span> <span id="s838">We made up to go to dinner the following evening and came to his apartment in north Tel Aviv.</span> <span id="s839">And his wife, while I was there, said to him, “You know, I’ve tried your Uncle Adolph several times today and there’s no answer and I’m worried about him.”</span> <span id="s840">So he said, “Well, let’s go out to dinner, we have reservations and after dinner, I will go and I will check up on him, make sure he’s all right.”</span> <span id="s841">And I said to him, “You know, Oded, I don’t feel comfortable in going out to dinner, eating, if he is an old man.</span> <span id="s842">Maybe you and I should go over there now.”</span> <span id="s843">He said, “Okay.”</span> <span id="s844">Got in the car, we went over there.</span> <span id="s845">We come to the apartments, an apartment building on stilts, and as we go towards the apartment door, I don’t know what made me do it, I said to Oded, “Do you have a key?”</span> <span id="s846">And he said, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s847">And I said, “Why don’t you give me the key and let me go in first?</span> <span id="s848">I don’t have a good feeling about this.”</span> <span id="s849">And I opened the door and no one in, we went to a back room, on a porch and he was lying on a couch, in rigor mortis, had been dead for about eight hours or so.</span> <span id="s850">So, we sat down, we had to call the -- the mortuary and so on and we were sitting there and saying, gee, you know, if I had come one day later, I couldn’t have found him at all, because it was unpublished, so, weird event.</span> <span id="s851">Now, Oded and I, after we had dinner and we talked about things and so on, we were both trying to remember the name of the third young man.</span> <span id="s852">Both of us remembered him, because we had his picture, but we couldn’t remember his name.</span> <span id="s853">We asked a number of people we thought might know, they did not.</span> <span id="s854">About two months later, on Israeli television, they were showing the movie, I think it’s called, “Les enfants ont peride.”</span> <span id="s855">French movie about Jewish children who perished in the monastery.</span> <span id="s856">And afterwards they had a panel and they asked Oded to be on the panel, since he had that experience of being in a monastery, they asked him to be a panelist, to react to the film.</span> <span id="s857">And, as part of his reaction, he told the story of our meeting and he showed the picture that I had brought him, and he said, “We know this boy is Jewish, we don’t remember his name, we’d love to be able to find him.”</span> <span id="s858">Well, in Haifa, a man is sitting and watching television and listens to this and next day he’s going on business to Poland.</span> <span id="s859">He goes to Warsaw and he goes to the Yiddish theater in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s860">And afterwards, is invited to meet the manager, whose name I forgot.</span> <span id="s861">And as part of the conversation, he says to the manager, “Before I came here, I heard this story on Israeli television.</span> <span id="s862">Do you know anyone who would fit that?”</span> <span id="s863">And he said, “Of course, that’s Daniel Rottfeld, he lives two blocks down, in Warsaw.”</span> <span id="s864">Well, Daniel Adam Rottfeld was in fact the third boy.</span> <span id="s865">He was, at that time, afraid to write me, because Poland was still Communist, so he got in touch with an uncle in Italy and suddenly I got a letter from Italy, telling me about him and the fact that he very much would like to be in touch with me, but that he can’t, and the reason he can’t is that he works -- worked at that time for the foreign ministry.</span> <span id="s866">Now, eventually, when the Iron Curtain fell and so on, and we could exchange letters, it turned out that Daniel was left in the monastery, no one claimed him.</span> <span id="s867">He was young, his parents had been killed, no one knew he was there.</span> <span id="s868">And when Russia and Poland made their pact, Poland took all of it’s orphans and -- and moved them to the western parts, so he was moved to an orphanage in Kraków.</span> <span id="s869">He ran away several times from the orphanage, eventually found a sister and went to the university in Warsaw, received a degree in journalism and a degree in international relations.</span> <span id="s870">And became one of Poland’s fine-finest workers in the foreign ministry, despite his name of Rottfeld.</span> <span id="s871">He didn’t hide the fact that he was Jewish.</span> <span id="s872">And he led almost every Polish peace delegation.</span> <span id="s873">He was one of the authors of the Helsinki accords.</span> <span id="s874">He brokered the peace treaty and -- for Gorbachov and Muldova, and has written some 300 papers, books and so on, on international relations, particularly relations with Germany, of which he is an expert.</span> <span id="s875">Today he’s the director of a peace institute in Sweden, in Stockholm.</span> <span id="s876">And so -- so I thought I’d bring you up to date on how strange the world is.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">Q: What a -- You know, I was just thinking what a incredible program it would be to weave -- to take this picture and then just weave the lives together, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s878">A: Tremendous, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Q: Incredible, remarkable lives that you have all lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s881">But you asked me whether we went back.</span> <span id="s882">Well, I think it was nine -- it was either 1990 or ‘91, I can’t remember exactly.</span> <span id="s883">I received a letter telling me that the memorial would be placed on the -- in Katowice, on the square where the synagogue used to stand.</span> <span id="s884">And that a number of people of the former community of Katowice were going back to Katowice for this memorial thing.</span> <span id="s885">I got it and I tossed it aside.</span> <span id="s886">I had no interest in going back to Poland, I really wasn’t sure I wanted to go there.</span> <span id="s887">But my wife, who has very good instincts and a lot of wisdom, picked it up and said to me, “I think you should go.”</span> <span id="s888">And I said, “Why?</span> <span id="s889">What do I need them for?”</span> <span id="s890">And she said, “For two reasons.</span> <span id="s891">One is that, since this is being placed in the place where the synagogue was, and your father was the rabbi of the synagogue, it would be very important for the people coming back, to have the son of their rabbi be present.</span> <span id="s892">And the second thing is that this is one of the few times you’re going to get an opportunity to meet people who knew your family and might be able to tell you things.”</span> <span id="s893">And as usually, she is very wise person.</span> <span id="s894">So we went and we offered our children the opportunity to go with us.</span> <span id="s895">Our boys refused.</span> <span id="s896">Our oldest said, “I don’t ever want to step on the soil of Poland.”</span> <span id="s897">Our youngest was too busy with something, but our daughter and son-in-law went with us.</span> <span id="s898">They had just been married.</span> <span id="s899">And it was a very moving ceremony, at which I sang the prayer for the dead.</span> <span id="s900">It was televised on Polish television and radio, was in all the newspapers.</span> <span id="s901">I did indeed get an opportunity to speak with -- with many members of the congregation who had come back, who were now elderly.</span> <span id="s902">We had had an opportunity to go to the cemetery and then -- which is intact, interestingly enough and visited the graves of my great-grandparents and I’m named after my great-grandfather, so I was able to reconnect with that.</span> <span id="s903">Did some research in some of the libraries in -- in Katowice.</span> <span id="s904">And, on the day I was signing out of the hotel, I’m standing in line to sign out and an elderly lady, 76 years old, all dressed in black, comes up to me and says to me in Polish, “Bat Chameides?”</span> <span id="s905">I look at her and I answer her yes.</span> <span id="s906">And she says to me, “Happy Birthday.”</span> <span id="s907">And I looked at her, and she said, “Your birthday was three days ago.”</span> <span id="s908">And I said, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s909">And she said, “Your brother’s birthday is September the 16th.”</span> <span id="s910">And I said, “Yes,” I said, “my goodness.”</span> <span id="s911">So I said, “You must be Agnes.”</span> <span id="s912">And she said, “Yes, I am.”</span> <span id="s913">And Agnes worked for our family as -- taking care of the children, for seven years.</span> <span id="s914">She was a young woman in her 20’s.</span> <span id="s915">Now, she was an old lady, and she was very helpful, she told me a lot and she also brought me two pictures that she had, one of her and me and one of her and my brother, little pictures that she had kept for 50 years and that she gave to me.</span> <span id="s916">So -- So it was a very good trip from that point of view.</span> <span id="s917">We also went to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s918">Several years later, my oldest son came to me and said, “You know, I made a terrible mistake that I didn’t go with you to Katowice.</span> <span id="s919">Someday, I would really like to be there.”</span> <span id="s920">And I said, “Well, my wife and I -- your mother and I are going to Prague.</span> <span id="s921">If you’d like to come with us to Prague, we’ll be glad to take you and we’ll take a train ride from Prague to Katowice,” which we did.</span> <span id="s922">So I was able to show him.</span> <span id="s923">Our youngest son has not been there.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">A: Now, to Lvov we have not been back, although I have been trying to make arrangements to go back, I would very much like to go back to Lvov.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">Q: Is it possible to describe the -- the range -- I-I mean, you actually described it beautifully, but I mean, in terms of the range of -- of -- of emotions that you had when you went to Katowice.</span> <span id="s927">I mean, th-the -- the amount of terrible memories, mixed with the beautiful memories that you have.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">A: Well, you know, it was interesting.</span> <span id="s929">I didn’t have that many emotions when I went to Katowice, because I left Katowice in 1939, I was four years old.</span> <span id="s930">So, I have no memories of Katowice.</span> <span id="s931">So, my interest in Katowice was primarily, almost academic in terms of trying to understand a community and so on, but I -- I don’t have any memories, as such, of the town itself.</span> <span id="s932">It was emotional for me to -- you know, to go to the cemetery and to know that my father had officiated at that ceremon -- at that cemetery so many times.</span> <span id="s933">But -- But that’s about it, because you know, the synagogue isn’t standing.</span> <span id="s934">I did go to our former home, but I didn’t go up to the apartment, I just looked at the entrance, which didn’t mean anything to me.</span> <span id="s935">The apartment might have evoked other memories, but a number of the people who had tried to go to their former apartments, who were in the -- in the group, were so horribly received by the current tenants, who were terribly afraid that they were coming back to claim them, and all they wanted to do was to see them.</span> <span id="s936">So, they were so horribly treated that I didn’t want to put myself in that position, so I never even tried to go upstairs.</span> <span id="s937">So, I -- I didn’t have deep emotions, I think, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s938">Q: If it -- In -- In looking back at this whole period, if you -- I’m trying to ask this without having it sound so overly simplistic, but I guess what I’m trying to get at is -- is sort of the overall lessons that you’ve taken from it and that -- that’s something that we could spend hours and hours talking about, but I mean, in terms of both good and evil, I guess is what I’m -- what I’m asking about.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">A: It -- It -- It’s -- You know, I’m too close to it to have any type of objectivity and I -- I -- I wouldn’t dream of doing it.</span> <span id="s940">All I can say is that I think that -- I don’t think there’s been a day since -- since the war, that in one way or another, I hadn’t thought about it.</span> <span id="s941">So it -- it’s something which -- it’s rare for people to have an event in their lives, which in many ways so totally dominates their lives.</span> <span id="s942">So, it obviously has had an influence, but I don’t think -- I don’t think it has had an evil influence, except for the evil which was done, but in terms of an -- an influence on my life, I -- I would like to think that it’s all been for the good.</span> <span id="s943">I would like to think that I am a more tolerant individual because of it, that I’ve more understanding, that I have a deeper understanding of human nature, that I can see the humor in some German activity, that I try not to generalize about people.</span> <span id="s944">I think I have a -- a deeper understanding of my religion, but I don’t in fact know that that’s why I have it, cause I don’t know what I would have been otherwise.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s946">When I said evil, I -- I didn’t really mean that it would be a way that you -- something that you were carrying, but in terms of -- I guess maybe by way of explanation, I have a very close friend who’s a photographer, who spent -- do you know who the filmmaker Errol Morris is?</span> <span id="s947">He’s -- He’s a documentary filmmaker --</span></p> <p><span id="s948">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">Q: -- anyway, he’s doing a -- a film about the Holocaust and my friend is a still photographer and he went over -- he works with Errol, and he went to Birkenau, this last year.</span> <span id="s950">And of course, it was a profoundly moving and -- and troubling for him.</span> <span id="s951">And one of the things that he was saying -- he -- he’s Armenian and his whole -- his, you know, two or three generations past had their own genocide --</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Q: -- to -- to come to terms with and -- and his understanding of -- of his experience was that what happened was a universal lesson of what human beings can do to each other.</span> <span id="s954">Obviously there’s -- there’s many na-narratives one could take, based on experience and -- and just how you interpret the world.</span> <span id="s955">And I guess that’s part of what I was getting at and asking you about, this piece of it that -- that -- that -- that represents evil, which is whether you see this as a kind of a universal cautionary tale, or what -- what happened obviously to so many Jews as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">A: Well, I -- I -- I see it in two lights.</span> <span id="s957">There’s no question that there is a universality to it, in that it shows us the capacity for evil in human beings and the depths to which people can fall.</span> <span id="s958">And I think this is even stronger because the people who did that, were such a cultured people.</span> <span id="s959">They had everything going for them.</span> <span id="s960">We wouldn’t have been surprised if it had been done by people we admire less, or who had achieved less.</span> <span id="s961">But somehow we believed that great music, that Bach and Beethoven and Schiller and Gerta.</span> <span id="s962">The myth of western civilization is that these are the things that -- that conquer the beast in us and that civilize a human being and the shock is, they don’t.</span> <span id="s963">That deep down, this is what we can -- so there is a universal lesson that we all, unfortunately, have the capacity for that.</span> <span id="s964">At the same time, I think this was completely unique.</span> <span id="s965">And whereas the Armenians had a -- a major genocide against them, the uniqueness of the -- of the Holocaust was that this was planned as the -- as a decimation of genetic material.</span> <span id="s966">In almost every other instance that you can name, the enemy would come in, would kill off adults, they would take children and babies and raise them as their own.</span> <span id="s967">But here was a determination by a so-called civilized people, to -- to totally eradicate -- it was a pathological hatred to eradicate any sign of genetic material.</span> <span id="s968">For three generations, you were tainted.</span> <span id="s969">So if you were Christian and your parents were Christian, but you had a grandfather who was Jewish -- that’s unheard of in any other genocide.</span> <span id="s970">And -- So there is a universal lesson, but I think there is something which is so totally unique, which we cannot quite comprehend, about this particular one.</span> <span id="s971">And of course, I read somewhere, I forget where, but I read that Hitler made the mistake of picking on the wrong people, because had he picked a less literal -- l-less literary people, people wouldn’t have heard about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s972">But he happened to pick on a people who write a great deal, who study a great deal, who introspect a great deal.</span> <span id="s973">And therefore, every other book -- you can’t -- you can’t pass a day without someone making a film or -- and you don’t hear about -- that about the Armenians, or -- and -- and I wish we would, because if we had, maybe people would be more cognizant, at least about that element in the human capacity.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">Q: I wanted to ask you one other thing along those lines, which is sort of another strain of -- of meaning, which is the resilience, that -- that your life exemplifies, I mean, th-the incredible resilience that you’re sitting here and us sitting here talking represents, it’s remarkable.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q: And which is perhaps both universal and particular.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">A: Well, you know, no one -- I didn’t arise in a vacuum.</span> <span id="s978">You know, I’m the product of many, many generations of very learned Jews, who had a philosophy of life and -- and -- and that philosophy of life was passed down from generation to generation.</span> <span id="s979">And -- And every prayer that we utter and every aspect of our lives, reinforces the strength of the human character and the human spirit.</span> <span id="s980">The fact that we are indeed created in the image of God.</span> <span id="s981">Our freedom, our ability and the need for us to strive to achieve the highest that humanity can -- can have.</span> <span id="s982">So I’m heir to that tradition and -- and -- so if there is a resilience, it’s -- it’s because, I think, of that tradition.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">Q: Is there anything that you’d like to -- need to add to our conversation of any particular aspects of what’s happened and what -- what, you know, different events in your life that you’d like to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s984">A: No, not really, you know, I -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s985">I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s986">I -- I had a -- When I go on planes, I always like to talk to people.</span> <span id="s987">I strike up conversations with people, find out what makes them tick and so on, and I was on a plane some years ago, going from Asunción, Paraguay, to Sao Paolo, Brazil.</span> <span id="s988">And I was sitting next to a couple who were speaking German.</span> <span id="s989">So I -- about my age, so I started speaking German to them.</span> <span id="s990">And the man who was sitting next to me wanted -- he wanted to know how it -- “Where did you learn such good German?</span> <span id="s991">Where did you learn to speak German?”</span> <span id="s992">And I told him that was my mother tongue and told him that I was born in -- in Poland and so on.</span> <span id="s993">And he said to me, “You know,” he said, “I was in Poland once.”</span> <span id="s994">I said, “Really?</span> <span id="s995">When were you in Poland?”</span> <span id="s996">He said, “When I was only about seven or eight years old.</span> <span id="s997">But my father was an officer in the German army and I was stati -- and he was stationed in Kraków.”</span> <span id="s998">He said to me, “But,” he said, “I want you to know, my father had no role in this at all.</span> <span id="s999">But I do remember,” he said, “once, we were going down a street and I looked and I think I saw some Jews, and he made me turn the other way.</span> <span id="s1000">And I asked him, ‘Who are these people?’</span> <span id="s1001">And he said, ‘nevermind.</span> <span id="s1002">’” And he said, “And that’s the only time I heard.”</span> <span id="s1003">And we talked a little bit more, and he turned to me and he said, “You know, I can’t go anywhere in this world, and we have traveled so much, and I can’t go anywhere in this world, without meeting someone who has gone through this and I feel such incredible guilt about what we did.</span> <span id="s1004">What can I do?”</span> <span id="s1005">And I turned to him, I said, “My friend,” I said, “you were seven years old and I was seven years old.</span> <span id="s1006">I wasn’t responsible for my victimhood and you weren’t responsible for what your people did.”</span> <span id="s1007">I said, “But we each have an obligation.</span> <span id="s1008">Your obligation is to teach your children and grandchildren and their friends what happened and why it must never happen again.</span> <span id="s1009">That’s your personal obligation.</span> <span id="s1010">And it’s my obligation to teach my children and my grandchildren.”</span> <span id="s1011">And with that, we parted in Sao Paolo.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">Q: [inaudible] End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">Q: -- makes -- what you just said, makes me want to ask about -- you’re talking about the teaching, and this German man teaching his children, you teaching yours.</span> <span id="s1014">What -- What is -- is -- is -- I guess one of the things I want to ask you about is -- related to this is, is safety one of the crucial lessons or th -- t -- ensuring safety?</span> <span id="s1015">Is that -- Is that part of it?</span> <span id="s1016">Or is it -- is it much broader?</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">A: Well, what do you mean by ensuring safety?</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">Q: Well, you were -- I mean, th-the Holocaust perhaps represents the ultimate in -- in -- in not being safe and -- and I know from you know, my trips to -- to Israel, as a journalist and -- and -- and [indecipherable] and many Jewish friends, that the need for safety is something that people talk about a lot, and I just wondered, in terms of lessons --</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">A: Oh, there’s no question, you know, the creation of Israel is -- was an incredible event in our lives, even as young as I was, I was 13 at the time, th -- it remains one of the high points of my life and I feel so privileged to have been put on this earth, both at a time of great sorrow and of great joy.</span> <span id="s1020">There is no century, I don’t think, in which the events that have unfolded in Jewish history, have been as great as this century, and to have lived through those, that’s just an incredible privilege.</span> <span id="s1021">And Israel is -- is -- is obviously terribly, terribly important.</span> <span id="s1022">It’s -- But beyond that, I don’t know what else to say on the issue of -- of safety, but it is -- it is important and it is one of the problems, I think, also, that Israel has.</span> <span id="s1023">I think Amas Alon, in his book, “The Israelis,” has one quote which is just always -- I’ve always thought was incredible.</span> <span id="s1024">He says, “The Israelis fight the Arabs by day and the Nazis at night.”</span> <span id="s1025">And -- And there’s no question that there’s a lot to that.</span> <span id="s1026">And it’s shaping foreign policy and -- and -- and it’s understandable that it should.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1028">That’s -- I can’t think of anything else I want to ask you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: Okay, good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">Q: I want to thank you very much for your time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">A: No, not at all.</span> <span id="s1032">Glad to have done it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">End of Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">Conclusion
