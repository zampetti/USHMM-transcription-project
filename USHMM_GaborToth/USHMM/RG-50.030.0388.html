For the record, I would like you to state your name, your date of birth, and where you were born.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">A: My name is Samuel Makower, born Smuel Makower.</span> <span id="s12">This is a [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s13">I was born January the sixth, 1922 in Shasnich.</span> <span id="s14">This is a city in Poland, north of Poland, near the Prussian border.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s16">Tell me a little bit about your life before the war, your family, your town.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: The town was a little, typical shtetl.</span> <span id="s18">The -- although the majority of the people were Poles, and there were about eight to 9,000 population, and about -- over two thou -- 2500 Jews.</span> <span id="s19">The -- I was born to a family le -- relatively large family, we were nine children, and my father was a business man.</span> <span id="s20">Went -- finish public school, and after that I went to a Jewish high school which was in Lubuc, a city about 20 miles away from a -- from our -- from Shasnich.</span> <span id="s21">And I was here a student till the war started.</span> <span id="s22">The war started, I still remember, Friday, 1939, and we heard immediately the thundering of the cannons.</span> <span id="s23">And all Jews left the city next day, Saturday.</span> <span id="s24">Went south, to relatives.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s26">I need to stop you here, because I still want to know a little bit more about your -- your life before the war.</span> <span id="s27">You mentioned that there was a -- for the population there was a f -- a fairly substantial Jewish community.</span> <span id="s28">Was -- was it integrated into the Polish community, or were most of your contacts Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: Most of the contacts were Jewish.</span> <span id="s30">As a matter of fact, I did not practically know any Polish people, except neighbors who were close by.</span> <span id="s31">But to plays, I used to play with the Jewish children, and one started life a -- in -- as a child in goldstu, in elderidge, and Haider, and then -- and school started in the morning, school, and after that you go to a Jewish school all day long, all the years.</span> <span id="s32">And when there was no Haider, because I was relatively good student, and I passed fast everything, then I wa -- I was invited by people to -- to read Talmud, to learn more with them in -- without charge.</span> <span id="s33">They wanted me because I was a good student, so they wanted with their son -- that I learn with -- with their son.</span> <span id="s34">So, till the evening -- the evening th -- I came home, made the lessons, went to sleep.</span> <span id="s35">Next day the same thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: Was there any anti-Semitism in the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: Not that -- there was anti-Semitism, no -- no doubt about it.</span> <span id="s38">Th-the Haider where I went to was near the church, so whenever it was some kind of a holiday, we were the killer of God.</span> <span id="s39">And -- especially on certain holidays when I had to go around the long way home because there was a procession, and in -- in the short way, and I knew that I will be beaten up if I’ll go there.</span> <span id="s40">So there was no -- no doubt.</span> <span id="s41">But often fights between Jewish children, and -- and Polish children.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: The Jewish community wa -- did you -- do you remember having a sort of active cultural life?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: Oh yes, there was a Jewish library, and all kind of Zionist lectures, and -- and we went -- we were exposed as young children already, to go, everybody want to -- hey, we’ll go -- we’ll try to go to -- to Israel.</span> <span id="s44">And when I chose to go to a Jewish high school, they definitely -- it was -- it was a Zionist no -- s -- a-admira -- at-atmosphere.</span> <span id="s45">And learning Hebrew, and Jewish history, a-and ne -- I een -- Hebrew language, and I -- I was supposed to read every week a book in Hebrew.</span> <span id="s46">One in Hebrew -- I mean, one in Polish.</span> <span id="s47">So -- but it was a Jewish culture, definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: And you were part of some of these youth organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: I started to go to a Hashamiratzaire, for various reasons.</span> <span id="s50">One is this is the only place where -- where I -- we could play ping pong, and this kind of thing.</span> <span id="s51">As children we were -- we were -- this was influential, playing together, and -- but in -- dreaming one day to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s52">And in the matter of fact, my f -- my sister went, before the war to Israel.</span> <span id="s53">Before the war started.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: Of course, part of the reason I ask this is that you later on, and -- were very active with the partisans, and I just wondered if -- if any of this came from kind of your life, or your ideology before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: No.</span> <span id="s56">This was a -- in the partisan it was simply because a -- as a way of -- to survive, and to take reveng -- revenge.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s58">We’ll get to that.</span> <span id="s59">I’m just trying to establish what your -- your life was like before the war.</span> <span id="s60">How much did you know about what was already going on in Germany and Austria?</span> <span id="s61">And Hitler?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: We knew that there was a ge -- there were ghettos, and something was going on it’s bad for Jews.</span> <span id="s63">But we did not know much.</span> <span id="s64">Cause -- because later we knew what was going on till ’39, because there were Jew -- papers, so we -- so we knew that Hitler is anti-Semite -- Semitic, and there are certain concentration camps, but at that time, nobody spoke about mass destruction somewhere, or -- or -- or killings.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: And you probably didn’t think that that would affect you?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: No, till -- till the -- when the war started, yes, we wonder -- this is why when -- I try to go toward -- toward Warsaw when the war started, because I thought I -- maybe there will be a fight, and I’ll not be on the side with the Germans, but I’ll be in the -- where the pol - - Polish are, and -- but unfortunately on their way, the Germans went faster toward -- came faster toward -- to Warsaw, to -- practically to -- see, they didn’t take Warsaw, but close to Warsaw, so that I was under the Germans, and -- and decided to go back to our city.</span> <span id="s67">When I came to our city, was about a few days, the commander of the city, a ger -- the German, told all Jews to come out one day.</span> <span id="s68">It was about the 15th abou -- of -- of -- of September, and put all the Jews in trucks and took them out towards the Russian border.</span> <span id="s69">Left us in a place where the Polish army used to exercise.</span> <span id="s70">The next morning they came again, and told us to walk toward the Russians.</span> <span id="s71">And we walked over there, and they took away everything what we ha -- what we still had, if they saw anything valuable.</span> <span id="s72">Like, my father forgot to hide his golden watch what he had from his father, they took it away.</span> <span id="s73">And I still remember to -- today the first Russian soldier we saw.</span> <span id="s74">And while the German were talking to us in such a derogative way, he was so nice, and said something, and I didn’t understand a word what he said.</span> <span id="s75">My father understood Russian because as a child, Shasnich was under the Russian, and he learned Russian.</span> <span id="s76">So he said, “Oh, he told us to go over there, where there is soup for us.”</span> <span id="s77">Alright, we went there -- the Jewish population of this small place me -- pr-prepare soup -- soup for us.</span> <span id="s78">For we a-ate something warm, and after that they took us to Bialystok.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: Couple questions.</span> <span id="s80">First, I’m sort of curious why the Germans pushed you toward Russian territory rather than just taking care of you themselves, and the other thing I want you talk a little bit about is kind of the general kind of mood, what it -- what this all felt like.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: As a whole, we were scared all the time, because we did not -- we knew that they hate Jews, as a fer -- a matter of fact, they -- this is why they took all the Jews and send them out, because they said that our city will be incorporated in the -- in the Reich, and they did not want to have Jews, the addition of Jews in the -- in the Reich, so they sa -- told us to go.</span> <span id="s82">And from the Russian point of view it was very nice [indecipherable] let us come in, as a matter of fact, for approximately two months, it -- borders were opening, everybody who came, who could -- who took advantage, and cou -- and came, survived.</span> <span id="s83">More Polish Jews survived after that in Russia than in Poland.</span> <span id="s84">The mood was of unknown.</span> <span id="s85">We don’t know what expects us.</span> <span id="s86">We know that after that -- after [indecipherable] already in Bialystok that we are free to do various things, that nobody persecute us as Jew.</span> <span id="s87">If there is something, a lack of certain things, because we saw how eagerly the j -- Russian soldiers is buying various things on the market.</span> <span id="s88">[indecipherable] So it is because everybody -- or nobody has enough, but not because we were Jews.</span> <span id="s89">So from this point of view I felt a -- it was good and we thanked th-the -- th-the German officer did not like to have Jews in hi -- in [indecipherable] in the -- in th-the matter of fact, in comparison is all the cities around Shasnich, more Jews survived Shasnich than all the -- in the cities around it, because they were completely destroyed.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: Were you with your f -- were you with your family?</span> <span id="s91">Who was with you at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: At this -- at that place, we were -- had part of the family, two -- I -- one -- my youngest brother and sister stayed with -- with aunts in another city, because it was near where they stayed when my -- when my -- our family left Shasnich the next day after the war, they stayed there because we did not know what will happen to us.</span> <span id="s93">I went with my older brother, further, and we came back, so we were -- and my -- my older sister, Anya, she was -- she worked in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s94">And when Warsaw was taken, she came back to Shasnich, and she was told that all the Jews were send away, so she didn’t know where to go, she went to the -- my aunt in -- i -- where my brother -- younger brother and sister were.</span> <span id="s95">And they -- she organized here a group of people she knew, and they all went also to the rush - - toward the Russian border.</span> <span id="s96">She asked my aunt and cousins to go with them, and they said no, they are business people, what do they do in Russia?</span> <span id="s97">They didn’t know -- they were afraid of Russia.</span> <span id="s98">And nobody survived, them.</span> <span id="s99">And my sister came -- as a matter of fact, I wanted to go back to bring my sister, and my father told me, “No, I don’t have -- I’m missing two daughters and -- and -- and a -- and a son, I don’t want to be -- to miss another son.”</span> <span id="s100">He didn’t let me.</span> <span id="s101">So every day I was going in Bialystok to the train station, waiting, watching, maybe my sister will come.</span> <span id="s102">And sure enough one day I saw a group and she was here, this is my younger sister, and she -- she came.</span> <span id="s103">We lived in Bialystok in a -- in one room, four or five families.</span> <span id="s104">Everybody had a corner, and sleeping on the -- on the floor, so many people were in the city, because the city of say like 100,000 had a -- had about 150,000 foreigners [indecipherable] who came in.</span> <span id="s105">There was no old schools, or -- synagogues were taken up by people as -- we slept on the floors.</span> <span id="s106">And one day there were -- came also a couple of guys, and it was my brother-in-law, and they started to like each other, my sister and my -- and my future brother-in-law, who came from Warsaw, also, to -- told -- went over to Russia.</span> <span id="s107">And we signed up -- there were always so-called -- we called them byersgame, and they were looking for people to work somewhere deep in Russia, and they were taking the people there to work.</span> <span id="s108">We said, we have nothing to lose, we don’t have what -- we will sign up -- we didn’t know where to -- and we signed up to go to work in Russia.</span> <span id="s109">They took us to a construction place.</span> <span id="s110">We drove for about a week on the railroad, deep into the Ural mountains.</span> <span id="s111">We came there, it was middle -- it was October, and I remember it was such a storm that from the railroad to the building to go down, was about 500 yard.</span> <span id="s112">We were running, and most of the people ended up this short pla -- walk, or run, to have frozen nose, frozen ears, because it was minus 40 something.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: Let me stop you for a moment.</span> <span id="s114">And that was all organized for you?</span> <span id="s115">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s117">How long were you in Bialystok, and what -- was there any normalcy to life there?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: Well we getting soup here, soup there, and the question was how to survive, and everything -- by trying to get something.</span> <span id="s119">Jewish -- the Je -- Jewish population organized help for the various people who came from all over Poland.</span> <span id="s120">And I don’t know if I -- exactly how the organization worked, but from our point of view they we -- we were relying on getting somewhere, something to eat, in order to survive.</span> <span id="s121">So we were looking for a place to -- to go to live permanently.</span> <span id="s122">Here and there, you heard, people did go into Russia, and they came back, because they say oh, it is such a poor life the -- there is -- the people don’t had no -- you don’t have stores open where you can buy things, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">And as a matter of fact, there were some people who decided maybe they’ll go back to the German -- to where the German is -- to the Jew -- home [inaudible].</span> <span id="s124">And after that, Stalin use all these lists of people who s -- wanted to go back, and send them all to Siberia.</span> <span id="s125">And thanks to that, they survived, because the local population up there were -- was killed in ’40 -- ’41 - ’42.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: Your treatm -- your treatment by the Russian authorities, or the Soviet authorities in Bialystok was --</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: Oh, it was good, but they did not -- they probably supplied the food for the various organization to feed us.</span> <span id="s128">But on the whole, what I saw later, that Russia suffered from a lack of food, in spite of the fact they ha -- they had Ukrainia, which ha -- ga -- which has the -- had the best land in -- in Europe.</span> <span id="s129">So -- but this was -- I have ler -- later learned, was the illness of Russia, the -- the collectives.</span> <span id="s130">Cohoss what they called, they did not produce enough food.</span> <span id="s131">So the attitude was good, but they did not have.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: So, you stayed in Bialystok for how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: For about two months, or three months maximally, and -- but -- because late of the year, toward the end of the year, we came to Rockitienka, a small place in the Ural Mountains.</span> <span id="s134">We were all supposed to work on the construction.</span> <span id="s135">This was a small place where they build -- they were supposed to be build houses for miners, because they had a copper mine, and also the copper had a certain percentage of gold, so gold and copper was being taken out.</span> <span id="s136">And Jewish people came, and we were taught to build, and we worked in this region.</span> <span id="s137">Since I was below 18, so I did not have to work eight hours a day, but just six hours a day.</span> <span id="s138">And one day a week we had free, so the -- in the winter they volunteered me always to shovel snow, because there was plenty of snow.</span> <span id="s139">In the winter the temperature was unbelievably cold.</span> <span id="s140">I cr -- I did not e-expect -- I didn’t hear about such cold, and we were work -- working on construction till minus 40 degrees.</span> <span id="s141">When there was minus 41, we could stay home.</span> <span id="s142">And we were supposed to work for one year.</span> <span id="s143">And this is what happened for one year.</span> <span id="s144">We worked there, and after that, they said you are free to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: I want to know a little bit more about the life there.</span> <span id="s146">Was -- was your family with you?</span> <span id="s147">Who -- who went with you?</span> <span id="s148">Did you -- were you able to sort of keep up some of your traditions?</span> <span id="s149">What was the life like?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: No, n -- ta -- Jewish traditions we have not kept at all.</span> <span id="s151">We did not know when a holiday is.</span> <span id="s152">Approximately we knew a -- there will be Passover, but nobody knew about -- definitely we can dream about matzos, was only food and bread, and bread was also so and so much per family.</span> <span id="s153">There was a card system.</span> <span id="s154">Per person, you got such and such an amount of bread.</span> <span id="s155">All other things were not available.</span> <span id="s156">You couldn’t go in a store if you want meat, you could buy only on the market, not in stores.</span> <span id="s157">Sugar you ca -- y -- they got - - they gave us -- we call it gave us, in other word we were buying, twice -- a few times a year, before a holiday.</span> <span id="s158">Like before the revolu -- anniversary of the revul -- revolution, and before the first of May, this is where we got -- we could buy the pound of sugar, or two pounds of sugar per person.</span> <span id="s159">In other cities, in large cities in Russia was different, and I had a chance, because my mother was sick, and she stayed in Bialystok in the hospital, and after that, I went to pick her up, and I st -- went to -- I got from the encoverdare from the -- I would just call the near -- the DPU?</span> <span id="s160">Anyway, permission to go, to get the ti -- tickets.</span> <span id="s161">So I saw how I came -- stopped in Moscow, we slept there on the tr -- on the -- on the -- in -- at the station, and from there ti -- changed to another train to Bialystok.</span> <span id="s162">And in Moscow I could go out in the street, and -- and -- an-and buy sugar, so I -- I bought, I remember 10 on -- or 12 kilo, which is 20 pound of sugar, and carry it with me.</span> <span id="s163">Cause each time I went, I went in, there was a line where they gave only two pounds, but -- so I went five times, until they saw, “Hey, you were here already.</span> <span id="s164">I’ll call a policeman.”</span> <span id="s165">So I left.</span> <span id="s166">So I went -- went back.</span> <span id="s167">So I saw in other places in large cities that you can get.</span> <span id="s168">But when I -- then I brought my mother to Rakichenka, and they stayed there till we were free to -- to go where we want.</span> <span id="s169">My sister and my brother-in-law they had -- in the meantime had a little girl, and they decided to leave.</span> <span id="s170">My brother-in-law was getting letters from friends.</span> <span id="s171">And they said in the Polish part of Russia, like Bialystok, they were there, in charge, because they were Communists.</span> <span id="s172">And they said, “Come back, and you’ll have -- you’ll be alright.</span> <span id="s173">Come in.”</span> <span id="s174">So they went.</span> <span id="s175">They came to the border, the former bor -- the former border between Poland, and they -- and they did not let them go through.</span> <span id="s176">So they came -- they came -- it was near Minsk, they went into Minsk.</span> <span id="s177">And here in Minsk, I -- we knew somebody, and the story was, when we were in Rakichenka, I learned fast to -- the language, to read and write Russian.</span> <span id="s178">And one day a young man came to me, “Sam, write me a letter in Russian.”</span> <span id="s179">And he told me in Polish what to write, “Dear uncle, I am the son of your brother,” so and so.</span> <span id="s180">“We received from your letters till 1936.</span> <span id="s181">In 1936, we stopped getting any letter.</span> <span id="s182">If you are alive, please write to me, I am here in Rakichenka, and I am here working till -- I am supposed to work till the end of 19 -- till 1940.</span> <span id="s183">And please write.”</span> <span id="s184">After a short time he got a answer, and it came back to me, say -- the letter was written by his cousin.</span> <span id="s185">“Your uncle passed away, but I live in his house,” and it said, “When you will free -- be free, come to Minsk, my husband is a officer in the Red army, he’ll arrange for you to be able to stay in Minsk.”</span> <span id="s186">And indeed, when our contract finished, he left for Minsk, and he kept -- he wrote us letters on a -- wrote them because we were -- thanks to me he got -- went there.</span> <span id="s187">“Oh,” they say, “you can go in stores, they are -- you can get jobs here, and your -- and there is a different life.”</span> <span id="s188">Temperature definitely no comparison.</span> <span id="s189">There is no such a temperature like it was in -- in Poland, close to.</span> <span id="s190">No in -- because in Rakichenka, we were about 10 days a year without wind.</span> <span id="s191">Winter was a cold wind blowing, in summer a hot wind blowing.</span> <span id="s192">Summer you -- you slept in the outside, because it was too hot to sleep in the house, and winter was too cold.</span> <span id="s193">So my sister and brother-in-law went to Minsk and -- and this officer arranged for them a place to stay, and a job.</span> <span id="s194">Because in a large city in Russia at that time, you could get a job if you had an apartment, if you had a place to live.</span> <span id="s195">And you could get a place to live if you had a job.</span> <span id="s196">So it was a circle, so that people from outside will not be able to get into the large city, because in the large -- large cities like Minsk, Kiev, and so on, there were -- it was another type of living than in the -- than in the small places where we were in -- deep in Russia.</span> <span id="s197">So they got their place to live, and they wrote a -- now it was my turn to come, because I wanted to start -- to continue to study.</span> <span id="s198">And in the large Russian cities, you could work at day and study in the evening.</span> <span id="s199">You couldn’t where we were in a small place, in -- in Rakichenka.</span> <span id="s200">We didn’t have money for the whole family to leave, and when we -- we sold what -- what excess of -- we had, in order to -- so that I could buy a ticket for me, and I went.</span> <span id="s201">And I managed to come to Minsk, there were three weeks before the war started.</span> <span id="s202">Before June.</span> <span id="s203">So in June I went -- I came to -- to -- beginning of June to -- I came to Minsk.</span> <span id="s204">The 22nd of June, the -- the -- the Germans attacked, and Minsk was bombed.</span> <span id="s205">We tried to go back toward -- after few days we tried to go back toward Moscow, but the Germans were in front of us.</span> <span id="s206">They came from the north.</span> <span id="s207">They took Smollensk before they took Minsk.</span> <span id="s208">So we -- we ha -- had to go back.</span> <span id="s209">And after a month, they told the Jews to come to form the ghetto.</span> <span id="s210">So I -- yeah, I believe in July or in August, they formed the ghetto, and we were in ghetto in Minsk.</span> <span id="s211">In ghetto, life was -- we try -- we found a -- a -- a place, an unfinished house, one room.</span> <span id="s212">So we in the one room, my brother-in-law, sister, the child, and me -- and myself, so we are in one room.</span> <span id="s213">Again it started.</span> <span id="s214">The Germans were giving us -- giving us two pound of bread per person and that was that.</span> <span id="s215">So the people, in order to survive were selling various things, whatever they had.</span> <span id="s216">In Russia, people were assembling, everybody -- whatever was in the store, they were buying.</span> <span id="s217">I remember there was a saying when you went somewhere you saw suddenly a line, so th-the question was, what do they give?</span> <span id="s218">Once I asked, “Why do they say, what do they give?</span> <span id="s219">Why don’t they say what do they sell?”</span> <span id="s220">So one was standing in line said, “If you buy it here, it is like you got it,” because after that you can sell it for two or three times the price.</span> <span id="s221">So everybody was assem -- whatever they could buy, and everybody had so and so many yards of material.</span> <span id="s222">And so, as a whole, ke -- to keep it whole, a supply, not to wait when you need a pair of pants to buy a pair of pants.</span> <span id="s223">And this was a time when everybody was selling what they had.</span> <span id="s224">Peasants were coming from around the area, and the border of the ghetto was always a -- an exchange.</span> <span id="s225">We were living on this -- we were -- in the middle people were coming a -- we have a woman was coming, she has a suit she wants to change for potatoes.</span> <span id="s226">We -- my brother-in-law was [indecipherable] he used to go over to the Russian side.</span> <span id="s227">We always had -- had -- we could snap the -- the wire, there were wires around, and -- and g -- and go over, and -- and since he, as a whole looked like what they call a -- looked like a po -- a Pole, and so he was going out and there getting more than on the -- on the border.</span> <span id="s228">You know, he used to come and take it in, and I was standing, watching, and there is a policeman nearby.</span> <span id="s229">And giving him signs he has to come, or not to -- not to come.</span> <span id="s230">And this way we were -- we were getting there a little more than what you could get a-at a border, so we were in the middle mi -- in this way -- from this way we lived, we -- we got a certain amount of food from it.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: Was there a risk?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: Oh yes, there was a risk, because there were a lot of people killed, I mean, but my brother-in-law even -- when -- later when the slats went even into -- into -- to villages.</span> <span id="s233">He went out of the city 10 - 20 miles, and there exchange it, and bring it back, were two guy.</span> <span id="s234">I went a few times, but since I wear glasses, they immediately recognized me as a Jew, and -- because Russians usually don’t wear glasses.</span> <span id="s235">So I used to walk without glasses, and without glasses I don’t see anything.</span> <span id="s236">So I couldn’t go too much -- too often.</span> <span id="s237">Once or twice I went -- once or twi -- a number of times I went out.</span> <span id="s238">There was one family was working the place where they were making vodka.</span> <span id="s239">[indecipherable] but he used to bring us so and so many bottles vodka, and we had a steady guy who was giving us food, either flour, or various kind of -- various kind of other -- other food for the -- for the vodka.</span> <span id="s240">We were a steady supplier, and we were giving them, and a little bit leaving over for us.</span> <span id="s241">And once I remember I went over and a policeman caught me, with a ra -- another guy and I -- and I was thinking a -- I was looking for a stone to hit him, because I -- you know, I will not go into the -- into the police station, because if somebody was taken to the police, he never came back.</span> <span id="s242">But he went with me, he saw where I came from, and he saw there the bottle vodka was still on the table, what I left, and there -- and they took me out into the - took me back to the border and said, don’t -- to the -- go -- go back to ghetto, don’t ever come back, and that was strange.</span> <span id="s243">And after that, the guy with who [indecipherable] I saw him in -- in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s244">And I thought that it was two policemen.</span> <span id="s245">I said, “What are you doing?”</span> <span id="s246">He said, “I am a -- I am a Jewish guy, and I was outside, and this policeman caught me.</span> <span id="s247">And then we saw you, walking with a bottle of vodka.</span> <span id="s248">So we went to this place, and I paid for the vodka so that he can take the vodka, and he let me go.</span> <span id="s249">And he let you go, too.”</span> <span id="s250">So this was anything, this is how we were trying to get out.</span> <span id="s251">It was no problem to go out, because we always -- we’re -- we’re walking around with something to cut the wires, in order to be able to pass.</span> <span id="s252">But the question, well what you do after that?</span> <span id="s253">Everybody was -- most of the people were scared.</span> <span id="s254">There was one family to -- I used to go there to ask them for a piece of bread to bring to my sister, or -- and after that he begged me not to come, because he didn’t open the door, because he said the neighbors know, they noticed it.</span> <span id="s255">Because they were afraid.</span> <span id="s256">They did not want to be killed just because I came there.</span> <span id="s257">So we were going -- we were taken to work.</span> <span id="s258">At work we were getting -- men were ge -- getting some food at work.</span> <span id="s259">And there I was always either begging, if it was a - a -- if I -- if I cleaned the rooms of soldiers, begging them if they have a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s260">A good -- a good German was giving me a piece of bread, or something else to eat, and if he was bad, he gave me a kick.</span> <span id="s261">So if it was outside the cities, I was -- there were always something growing, so we’re stealing a few -- a few carrots, or a few potatoes.</span> <span id="s262">And if the -- in the worse case, when they didn -- when I didn’t have what to take, so I was taking even the clippings from potatoes from the -- from where we worked, for it was -- my sister used to wash the clipping, and make -- make from this potato latkes.</span> <span id="s263">And this is on what they lived.</span> <span id="s264">Since the war -- the war -- the wa -- there was one guy who we always were ascared of, and his name was Gorajetski.</span> <span id="s265">He was a -- he had written on the -- belina politsi was written.</span> <span id="s266">He spoke Russian and German, obviously.</span> <span id="s267">And he could not eat breakfast without killing a Jew.</span> <span id="s268">And once we -- he got us, and we worked for him, my brother-in-law and myself, and we said never again.</span> <span id="s269">And this was not work, it was just making fun of us.</span> <span id="s270">Trying to catch -- to carry -- and running and beating us while we were carrying it from place to place, and then another group was taking it further, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">This was fun for him.</span> <span id="s272">So -- and after that, he organized like a -- a camp separate.</span> <span id="s273">The people could not come from [indecipherable] outside the ghetto.</span> <span id="s274">They were there with a group of Ukrainians were guarding it, and these people could not come home to the ghetto, they were sleeping over there.</span> <span id="s275">So whenever we saw him we did not go to work, because normally people -- other workers were coming, looking for people to work, taking to work, doing either construction work, or cleaning, or whatever, and in the evening coming back at home, you know.</span> <span id="s276">This we wanted.</span> <span id="s277">In order to avoid, since they were looking for work -- were looking for workers each time, and looking for people to this camp -- it was on Schirrocca Street, I remember, we -- in order to be able to hide, we built a double wall.</span> <span id="s278">A very -- we moved the wall in our apartment, made it a little narrower.</span> <span id="s279">Since we worked in construction, I went to the neighbors room and covered it, a -- because otherwise we could -- you could see through.</span> <span id="s280">And in our place was just wood.</span> <span id="s281">So we could open, go in, hide, and -- and talk to neighbors, they realized, hey, whenever they’re looking for -- for men, you are running home.</span> <span id="s282">Where do you hide in the -- in there?</span> <span id="s283">And then they saw the -- the Ukrainians are going in and coming out empty, no wa -- nobody -- they don’t catch you.</span> <span id="s284">They looked -- they told us, they look for where we’re hiding, and they didn’t no -- they didn’t no -- notice that we had build this -- this double wall to hide.</span> <span id="s285">Other people were hiding behind -- under the floor -- the fir -- floor, there was a place to crawl in, and they were hiding there.</span> <span id="s286">So this was as long as they were looking just for men, and once we saw e -- they were taking whole families.</span> <span id="s287">Since we lived all in a place where the street was a free, for Aryan, not for Jews, on the other side was ghetto, on this side was a ghetto.</span> <span id="s288">And so we saw they were -- they take -- they took whole families, a few thousand people.</span> <span id="s289">And taking them out and then they never came back.</span> <span id="s290">And they shortened the ghetto, they made the ghetto smaller.</span> <span id="s291">So we start to think, what do we do for -- if -- if they come here?</span> <span id="s292">In addition to wait, we started to hear that they have automobiles where they put in people, and put the gas in -- in automobile, and they gas the people in there.</span> <span id="s293">So whenever we heard -- heard cars coming, we started to hide.</span> <span id="s294">What to do with the -- your little girl, the little girl that we too -- took her in between the wall, was crying there.</span> <span id="s295">So we cided -- decided to build something on the first of this -- we lived on the second floor.</span> <span id="s296">On the first floor, there was one part which was not finished.</span> <span id="s297">In one of the not finished room, they build a deep, in the ground, we put wa -- tube, so to -- so they’ll get air, and there we saw, when the little girl was crying, outside you didn’t hear.</span> <span id="s298">So the next time there was a thing where we had to hide, I was taking my brother-in-law, sister, and the child to this, lay down, and I was covering it with sand.</span> <span id="s299">Sand made it even so that you don’t see that anything is there.</span> <span id="s300">Then I was going up and hiding in the -- between the door.</span> <span id="s301">And this way how we were all kind of -- we call it pogroms, we survived the pogroms in this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: Talk a little bit about these pograms, what you saw, what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: Mostly it was the -- the killers were Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s304">They were -- they surrounded a -- a -- an area, took the Jews out, into the forest nearby.</span> <span id="s305">In most of the cases, we knew that there will be a pogrom, because there are people who worked for the ge -- for the -- in the city, and they heard a -- a group sondercommander came in.</span> <span id="s306">And when a sondercommander came in, means something will be happening -- will be happening in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s307">And indeed, they used to use Ukrainians or Latvians, and encircle a certain area, one street, or two street, take all the people out in the morning, and lead them out from the city.</span> <span id="s308">In most of the cases, we saw them through this way, between the ghetto, wik -- which was a -- a passage from north to south.</span> <span id="s309">So we su -- sometime when we looked, we saw hey, they are taking out a group of people, a number of people.</span> <span id="s310">And once they have circled also, the people from the other side of the street, and they emptied there.</span> <span id="s311">So I thought they’ll make the ghetto smaller.</span> <span id="s312">And they -- instead of this, they brought German Jews.</span> <span id="s313">Jews from Hamburg, Jews from Czechoslovakia, they brought there, and they were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: In the other side?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: In the other side.</span> <span id="s316">So, to go over there wit -- there was one place near the Judenrat, where there was a door -- a door to go across the street and go to the other side.</span> <span id="s317">In the middle we were not allowed because we had to wear a -- what -- we would -- we did not have a Star of David like Jews in Poland or in Germany had, but a round yellow -- yellow -- a y- yellow circle.</span> <span id="s318">In the beginning I used not -- not to wear it.</span> <span id="s319">But then -- and I heard that several people were caught and they were shot because they did not have the yellow sign, so I started to wear the yellow sign here.</span> <span id="s320">If I wanted to go into the Aryan side, I covered it, and in ghetto I was going like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: Did you see -- did you feel safe walking on the streets of the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: In the ghetto, in most of the cases yes, except when this Gorajetski was -- was in.</span> <span id="s323">Then -- he was coming in always with a group of y -- of Ukrainians, and then definitely, men were not saved.</span> <span id="s324">Often during the time when the men were at -- at work, this Gorajetski used to come into the ghetto and circle two or three street, take all the women out into the -- into a place, and ask for gold.</span> <span id="s325">In the beginning nobody was giving him, but -- so he took two women and shot them.</span> <span id="s326">So then everybody who had all their rings, and wedding rings, he used to collect in -- in -- in suitcases, and was getting suitcases from the rooms, going around.</span> <span id="s327">So if he survived, he had a lot of gold, because each time he was taking a different -- a different area.</span> <span id="s328">You know, somehow, Russian Jews had also gold rubles from the last time, they had hidden.</span> <span id="s329">He wa -- he was collecting everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: Was there any logic to who was taken out?</span> <span id="s331">Did they go for certain types of people?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: No, when they were taking out, they were taking out whole families.</span> <span id="s333">They were taking areas.</span> <span id="s334">They had an area a -- the main street, the -- the ghetto, two or three streets shorter, till one da -- this was all -- yes, till it was summer ’42.</span> <span id="s335">We had to stay at work for four days.</span> <span id="s336">Once I remembered exactly the date.</span> <span id="s337">I think it was in July, but I don’t -- I don’t recall now.</span> <span id="s338">And at that time, they took all the women and children out, and killed them.</span> <span id="s339">And I remember after four days we were going back, and everybody was crying, being sure that his relatives, his wifes, children, or mothers are -- are gone.</span> <span id="s340">And we thought so too, my brother-in-law and myself, I went.</span> <span id="s341">And then we came and my sister and the child were alive.</span> <span id="s342">And she said on the third day after she saw that we did not come, she wanted already to go out.</span> <span id="s343">What she did is, she was going in -- into -- sitting in th -- in the hiding place without cover.</span> <span id="s344">And she was -- and why didn’t I -- the Germans not come, I can’t understand.</span> <span id="s345">And after this [indecipherable] because we wanted the Germans not to come, so we started to use the approach to it as a toilet, because we wanted not people to come.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Once I -- I -- I heard Germans were saying -- came in and I did not run up to, yet, to my door.</span> <span id="s347">When they were downstairs, “Och, this smells like urine, the -- the -- the dirty Jews.”</span> <span id="s348">So they use [indecipherable] especially use it -- use it [indecipherable] all.</span> <span id="s349">So I assume that this is when -- so the approach to the -- to the hiding place was dirty and had to -- you had to go in -- in through -- in the -- and they did not want to do it.</span> <span id="s350">So this is how she survived.</span> <span id="s351">And she thought that we were probably all taken out to be killed.</span> <span id="s352">So she wanted already to go out, and then she says she waited, and then we came.</span> <span id="s353">When we walked out in the street, my little niece was the last Jewish child in -- in -- in Minsk -- in the ghetto Minsk.</span> <span id="s354">Cause you didn’t see, and everybody looked.</span> <span id="s355">“Hey, a child.”</span> <span id="s356">Because, yes, women survived, either they were working, or they were hiding somewhere.</span> <span id="s357">But children were not -- she was the last one alive.</span> <span id="s358">And this was a time when already we started to get contact with people who knew something about partisans.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: Before we get into that, I wanted to ask you some general questions about the ghetto.</span> <span id="s360">I’m sort of -- I’m interested in a lot of things about the ghetto, in terms of the organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">You talked about working, and what kind of work was there.</span> <span id="s362">Who ran the ghetto, were there -- you know, did you have health facilities, did you have cultural facilities?</span> <span id="s363">Were -- did -- were there any schools, were there any sort of hidden activities?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: No, there was no -- at least -- we were -- sees, we were strangers.</span> <span id="s365">We were not locals.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Maybe there was a certain amount of distance between the -- these people and us.</span> <span id="s367">But we were not aware of any cultural activities.</span> <span id="s368">But there was a Judenrat.</span> <span id="s369">And the Germans told one, you will be in charge of the Jew.</span> <span id="s370">And initially was one who did not want too well to cooperate with the Germans.</span> <span id="s371">And I forgot his name, I we -- once I knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: Was this Barash?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: And after that became a eastern -- one -- a Polish Jew that came in charge, and he cooperated very well with the Germans.</span> <span id="s376">So -- and there were also Jewish policemen, who were forced to do dirty work, sometimes to -- to -- a -- as a whole you didn’t trust the -- the -- them.</span> <span id="s377">Obviously in charge of them were -- were -- were Germans, and there were always German police, and there were Belarusian police, and Ukrainians.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: All in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: All around the ghetto.</span> <span id="s380">Stay on the outside, they were always.</span> <span id="s381">Occasionally also Latvian came in.</span> <span id="s382">You never --</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: Inside the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: Inside the ghetto were only Jewish police, and you see -- you saw here and there, SS.</span> <span id="s385">Q: I think we need to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: Okay, I wanted to ask you a little bit more about the Minsk ghetto before we move on, what you can remember about the daily life, or what kind of work you did.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: I was in -- in the ghetto for over a year, I would say, about 14 months.</span> <span id="s390">And usually the -- you did not have any cultural life organ -- organized.</span> <span id="s391">It was everything there I saw temporary to survive, to try to survive.</span> <span id="s392">If there was an organization, health organization, yes.</span> <span id="s393">There was a -- a hospital, we were trying to take care.</span> <span id="s394">As a matter of fact, I was once -- I got sick from a friend, and there was a -- one guy from my city, from Shasnich in ghetto, and he came, and obviously there was no place to sit but to sit on the bed and he s-sat on the pl -- on the bed where I was sleeping on, and after a short time I heard that he got sick with typhoid.</span> <span id="s395">And I got sick after i -- after i -- after him, too.</span> <span id="s396">And they took me to the hospital, and I had such a high fever, that I remember after that that I was saying, “Hey, the war is over.</span> <span id="s397">My sister came to take me out, and you don’t let her in.”</span> <span id="s398">And I was going to open the door.</span> <span id="s399">And when I went from -- up from the bed, I fell on the floor.</span> <span id="s400">This I still -- this I still remember.</span> <span id="s401">And they put me ba -- back in.</span> <span id="s402">And when the fever was down, I could go home -- home.</span> <span id="s403">I could go back out of there and a -- I -- I hardly could walk the -- the -- the -- because the legs completely lost p -- lost power.</span> <span id="s404">But in -- in another two or three weeks, I came back to my -- to my normal -- I became back to my normal me, and I started to go to work again.</span> <span id="s405">The type of work where to serve a -- the military -- the Germans, you know.</span> <span id="s406">Either they were adding something, cleanin -- cleaning where they lived, cleaning the rooms was -- and this is something what I -- what people were looking for, because we could always get something from them to eat, to go out.</span> <span id="s407">Or it was other construction work, road work, cleaning.</span> <span id="s408">I tried to get away from it, only to where we can be -- be inside, I tried.</span> <span id="s409">The -- at work, we were getting soup.</span> <span id="s410">So everybody was going always with something where you can pour soup in, in -- and -- and they had -- it was Jewish girls who were preparing the soup for us to eat.</span> <span id="s411">They were also coming with us, and going back.</span> <span id="s412">We could not walk on the street, and we are taking -- we had to walk -- you could not walk on the -- where people walk.</span> <span id="s413">We had to -- in the street, Jews were not allowed, Jews were -- had to go only where the horses were going, and the car.</span> <span id="s414">Not -- not on the sidewalk.</span> <span id="s415">You -- after the war, I remember myself when I saw my -- my wife walking on the street side, why not -- why don’t -- it bothered me, why don’t you walk where people walk?</span> <span id="s416">Because I thought I was always under still the impression that this is where Jews were forced to walk, on the -- in the ci -- in the ghetto, very few people si -- tried to stay -- to go out, in order to survive, because otherwise you didn’t have what to eat.</span> <span id="s417">My si-sister was not -- of not working, so -- because of the child, and we were trying to bring something, and sometimes there were looking -- we carry back food, occasionally they were searching and taking away.</span> <span id="s418">So I had always a bag hanging, and it was hanging down to the -- because they were searching in the pockets, and I had always a piece of bread, potatoes or whatever, hanging down be-between the knee and the ankle, because there they were not looking.</span> <span id="s419">Also -- and sometimes I was having also something to put dirty -- make dirty the -- the -- the -- so that they’ll not touch here.</span> <span id="s420">Th -- used to make dirty from excrement, put on the -- on -- on my pants, in order so that they’ll not touch here, and after come home and clean it.</span> <span id="s421">To --</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: They weren’t factories or anything?</span> <span id="s423">A: No factory work, it’s wor --</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: How did -- how did you get chosen for work?</span> <span id="s425">Did -- could you say -- h -- h -- who determined --</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: We were -- there was a place in the front of the Judenrat where you come in to work, and w -- and Germans were coming in, soldiers, and choosing people.</span> <span id="s427">Sometimes they were looking for people to work in construction, so everybody who did work in construc -- or did know -- know -- like I -- I -- since I worked before in construction, I used to do that.</span> <span id="s428">You tried only -- I tried to avoid always not to work for the SS, not to work for Gorajetski, because he was ending up taking the men into the camp, which I said th-they never came back to -- to -- to the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: Was there any sense of normalcy, was there a social life, was there religious --</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: No.</span> <span id="s431">Jews did not know -- Jews in -- Russian Jews did not know much about religious life, because they were already so and so many years without religion.</span> <span id="s432">And -- but a return to Yiddish did occur.</span> <span id="s433">In the beginning, everybody was speaking Russian.</span> <span id="s434">And slowly, people started to speak Yiddish, more and more Yiddish.</span> <span id="s435">And even Russian Jews were not too fluent Yiddish, started to speak yid -- Yiddish.</span> <span id="s436">And you could see immediately the effect of -- [indecipherable] of Polish Jews who were -- who were in the ghetto, because they liquidated small places, and those who survived came to -- to Minsk, also other Russian je -- places, the ghettos were immediately liquidated, or slowly, and -- and they came to -- to Minsk.</span> <span id="s437">So Minsk had about -- the ghetto had about 120,000 Jews, and they were not just Jews from Minsk, but also from -- but mostly from the surrounding area.</span> <span id="s438">So culturally I could not see anything Jewish going on.</span> <span id="s439">Was -- everything was temporary -- temporarily.</span> <span id="s440">Russian Jews was hoping a -- the Red Army will come back, and viddle will maybe save them.</span> <span id="s441">Probably the Germans kept it, th-they thought they will simply liquidate -- kill slowly.</span> <span id="s442">And we came in contact with people who knew something about -- tha -- something that partisans are in the area, by -- somebody asked my brother- in-law, “We heard that you have a place to -- a hiding place,” a marinar we called it -- was called in -- in Russian.</span> <span id="s443">There is here a guy Smoller, whom the Gestapo is looking for.</span> <span id="s444">Could you hide him?</span> <span id="s445">My brother-in-law said, “Yes, no problem.”</span> <span id="s446">And we knew Smoller, because he was for a certain time sleeping at a family nearby in the -- in our -- in the same ar -- in the same house, neighboring door, and there was no place here, so he slept with me in my bed, we slept together.</span> <span id="s447">And he -- well, I was astonished to hear that he personally knew Stalin, that he was a member of the Communist party for so and so many years, from o -- the Polish and n -- that they were -- that the Gestapo is looking for him, so we s -- we said, “Yes, we’ll hide him.”</span> <span id="s448">And sure enough we put him in the place there where my -- where we were hiding my sister and the -- their little girl.</span> <span id="s449">And then I remember a lady came, she wanted to see him, we let her in also, and they talked for a certain time, and then away.</span> <span id="s450">In his book, Smoller described that oh -- that -- Sukaravich is the name of my -- my brother-in-law, hid him in a place where they probably hid -- was hiding things.</span> <span id="s451">He didn’t know we did it -- we build it especially for my little niece.</span> <span id="s452">So after a certain time -- he was there several days, and he was ready to go away, and he said that he’ll get us in touch with people, and -- when they will be looking for people to go into the forest.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: Was there an underground movement in the ghetto, and did you know about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: We did not know much about it, no.</span> <span id="s455">Were only selected people.</span> <span id="s456">We knew from time and ti -- to time that young people went away.</span> <span id="s457">And what happened is, after that, that the Gestapo was coming and killing the remaining family, when they heard a -- these young people were -- they killed overnight.</span> <span id="s458">So it was a danger if people left.</span> <span id="s459">And who told them, this I don’t know, that could have been these were -- Jewish police were telling them.</span> <span id="s460">And there were some Jewish policemen who were mean.</span> <span id="s461">And they helped -- as a matter of fact, one after that was so -- was in such -- such -- that when he tried after that to escape, and he was caught, and he came to the forest, the Jewish partisan killed him.</span> <span id="s462">The way he behaved in the -- in ghetto.</span> <span id="s463">But it was very difficult, they were very -- they were chose -- they were choo -- choos -- choosing -- the chosen people were -- had -- had contact.</span> <span id="s464">It was not easy.</span> <span id="s465">We got contact through this way, that we did hide Smoller, and he really after that send somebody.</span> <span id="s466">Since we expected after that to leave the ghetto, the question was what to do with the little girl.</span> <span id="s467">And at that time where my brother-in-law worked, was a very decent man, a soldier, who hated the SS the way we hated it.</span> <span id="s468">Heinz was his name, and I don’t recall what his family name, unfortunately.</span> <span id="s469">He was from Berlin.</span> <span id="s470">And this was a -- a group of soldiers who were repairing cars, mechanics mostly.</span> <span id="s471">My brother-in-law was coming there [indecipherable] once I remember he told them, I worked here a coup -- a couple days, and this Heinz came to me once with a book.</span> <span id="s472">And it wa -- it showed the Hotencroids taking and circling the map of Europe.</span> <span id="s473">And he wanted me to translate it, what is written, into German.</span> <span id="s474">And I was afraid to, and he said, “Go ahead, don’t afraid.”</span> <span id="s475">And I told him the name of the book is that the German want to occupy -- it’s German fascist wants to occupy whole Europe.</span> <span id="s476">And he asked me what year was it published.</span> <span id="s477">I told him ’36.</span> <span id="s478">So there was a group of soldiers, he say, “See comrades?</span> <span id="s479">In 1936, they already here knew that we will be spilling our blood all over Europe.”</span> <span id="s480">I couldn’t believe it, because the first time I heard a German speaking in this way about Germany.</span> <span id="s481">And he came to our house even, after that, and once after the war, at work, and once even they asked, “Oh, if there is something wrong, if you’re see -- know something is wrong in the ghetto, come to us, stay in our place.”</span> <span id="s482">And the officer pretended he did not hear it, I remember, what he said.</span> <span id="s483">So we asked him if he could d-do us a favor, put the child into an orphanage.</span> <span id="s484">We told him where there is an orphanage, and put her there that he found her.</span> <span id="s485">[indecipherable] a name Faynia Nikolayov Nasoharoa, I still remember, that this is her name, and I was teaching her her name.</span> <span id="s486">And so that whenever we were asking neighbors to ask her what her name, so she always used to say Faynia.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Faynia Nikolayov Nasoharoa.</span> <span id="s488">But when I asked her, she used to say, “But really, I am Fanyat Zokor.”</span> <span id="s489">She -- two years old.</span> <span id="s490">And that -- he put her there, and he used to come after work.</span> <span id="s491">My sister started to work also in that place.</span> <span id="s492">So after work, he brought all the workers to -- back to the ghetto, and he used to take my sister -- tell her to take off the -- or put on another -- something, a blouse, so that you don’t see the -- the -- the yellow sign, took her out like he walks -- walks with a fräulein.</span> <span id="s493">He used to go -- go with her so that she -- a b -- a block away from the ghetto she used to watch -- observe the girl.</span> <span id="s494">She was sitting always alone, not playing with the other children.</span> <span id="s495">One day the -- somebody came and said they are ready to -- that we should leave.</span> <span id="s496">And we said goodbye at that time.</span> <span id="s497">A day before that said goodbye to -- to Heinz.</span> <span id="s498">And next day, you -- you said according to -- we worked out -- we-went up like we were going to work, and after that, everybody took off the -- the -- the yellow signs, and we were -- went -- we had a woman who was leading us out of the city.</span> <span id="s499">We walked into the -- into the forest.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: How large of a group?</span> <span id="s501">A: We were 30 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: Men and women?</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: Men and women walked out.</span> <span id="s504">And there in the group, they put me s -- when they heard that I had a sister -- not together there, not to be with the sister and -- and -- and brother- in-law, I don’t why, they put me into another group, and -- and they formed the a -- or otriad, they called them -- it will come back, the name I knew.</span> <span id="s505">[indecipherable] I didn’t write it down, the name.</span> <span id="s506">And I was in another otriad, you know?</span> <span id="s507">And a -- a otriad is a -- the -- the group of Russian -- group of people.</span> <span id="s508">And we were going from place to -- we were -- we build -- we had a place in -- in the -- in the forest from the -- in the forest from there where we used to go out.</span> <span id="s509">There were a number of things to do.</span> <span id="s510">A, food, collecting food.</span> <span id="s511">B, it was do something, f-fighting.</span> <span id="s512">If there were -- in the beginning we were several people in -- in a -- in a village each time.</span> <span id="s513">If a German came, he did not come back, because we used to -- they -- they didn’t expect to be -- the partisans will be in the village, the qui -- Germans used to come and collect eggs.</span> <span id="s514">And because I -- apparently they did not get enough eggs from where they were.</span> <span id="s515">So we -- we used to kill them.</span> <span id="s516">But there were not too many such cases, but in -- slowly it -- it was known to them that in German stopped -- Germans stopped coming into the -- the village.</span> <span id="s517">So we got orders after that to move to -- back toward former Poland, the Russian not -- in other word, close in direction Bialystok.</span> <span id="s518">On the way Germans and Ukrainians circled us and we were -- yeah, we were dispersed.</span> <span id="s519">The name of the -- of the o -- otriad where my brother and sister was Lasop.</span> <span id="s520">And -- and I was -- slowly we so -- we were divided into small groups.</span> <span id="s521">We were about 10 people ins -- siz -- a lot of them were local people who were -- instead of being forced to go to Germany as workers, came to partisans, and to the -- so when they were -- when we were broken up, went back home, and we remained three guys -- another Jewish guy named Abrusha, and a Moscow guy, he didn’t have where to go.</span> <span id="s522">He was also a young person.</span> <span id="s523">We sat for a few days in our former place in the forest, and then we ci -- we all decided we’ll try -- there is another partisan group, Chicalifsky group, we’ll go to them.</span> <span id="s524">And sure enough, they accep -- accepted us immediately, and I stayed with this Chicalifsky group till the end of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: Now this is a Soviet partisan , this is not necessarily Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: No, not necessarily Jewish.</span> <span id="s527">The -- we heard about the Jewish group, Bialsky, who actually could live after that because we were there, because we would like to -- to say the guard for -- for them.</span> <span id="s528">But there were Jews in the place where I was, one Jew was a very famous guy.</span> <span id="s529">Not -- also the second one.</span> <span id="s530">We used -- we used to go out here, I saw something being done.</span> <span id="s531">Each time the group of 10 people, eight - 10 people used to go out and blow up a train.</span> <span id="s532">Usually we were blowing up trains going towards the front.</span> <span id="s533">And I was told this, that in the beginning, it -- they were blowing up the trains by -- by the weight of th -- that was blowing up.</span> <span id="s534">So the Germans put two, three wagons of sand in front of them, so it was blowing up the sand trains and they were slowing down.</span> <span id="s535">Because we try to put always mines in a place where there is a -- a bend, because then, in the beginning, if they were going fast, it was -- the whole train was going downhill.</span> <span id="s536">So they used slow down in the area, and -- and when they put sand, they were blowing up the sand and nothing happened, so there was a Jew -- the Jewish lieutenant, he came up with the idea that he was using hand grenades.</span> <span id="s537">The biyoke I don’t know how it is called in -- in -- in English, the place -- the thing which blows -- which s-starts the -- the hand grenade, used to unscrew it, make a -- make a -- a hole in -- in -- in a -- local places, he was finding a place which -- where they can put -- drill in metal.</span> <span id="s538">We were taking 50 kilo, or hundred pound bombs -- shells.</span> <span id="s539">These were plenty, which left from the Russian army, were drilling a hole, puttin -- put there -- screw in there the -- the handle from the hand grenade, open it, and through the ring, put this -- a wire through shmore -- in German how it is a -- so we were sitting hundred yards away, and we pulled it, it was blowing.</span> <span id="s540">So we -- we didn’t have -- we di -- the le -- the -- the -- the fuel -- always when we saw a train, the first thing, you know, we’re looking what -- what is in it.</span> <span id="s541">If there was some -- so-somewhere petrol, they always blew it under the petrol, because this made it th-the whole train was going up in flames.</span> <span id="s542">If there were no petrol, we looked at the a- ammunition.</span> <span id="s543">And if there -- the -- and the third choice was people.</span> <span id="s544">And if this was not a - so we used to blow up the -- the locomotive in order to -- so tha -- tha -- they wi -- they will have no locomotives.</span> <span id="s545">So this -- this was a choice of it.</span> <span id="s546">And the s -- each time another group was going with this device were used to blowing up -- blow up trains.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: Now, logistically, I’m trying to understand how you would know when it -- before a train came by, what to -- what to attack, what your priority was here.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: Oh I -- this was as I said, the priority.</span> <span id="s549">We were looking for trains going in the direction of -- to the fr -- toward Russia.</span> <span id="s550">And the -- the -- and the priorities what I have mentioned was -- we are loo -- we look to --</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: How did you -- how did you know that?</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: Oh, we did not know.</span> <span id="s553">We looked at the train, and we saw hey, do we see any -- any -- if we didn’t see any -- anything special, so we blew up the locomotive.</span> <span id="s554">And most of the cases, when they were ga -- going a little fast, the whole thing wer -- because we was choosing a place where there is a -- a -- a bend, and if not, whatever pla -- train which was going toward the front wa -- but you could see th -- if there are people, soldiers, or if they’re -- they are -- they are ammunition, this you could see.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: Now, here you are, one time a boy who was studying a Talmud, all of a sudden blowing up trains.</span> <span id="s556">How -- what -- did they tr --</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: And I became a specialist.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: Did they -- did they -- did they train you?</span> <span id="s559">I mean, how did -- A: No, no one, but your --</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: How did you -- how did you learn how to do all these things?</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: The len -- as I said, this officer, this Jewish officer, Jewish lieutenant, he was the one who gave explanation how -- wa -- how it works, and this is why we knew how to -- but -- and he used to prepare it.</span> <span id="s562">And we used to go out and -- and do the job.</span> <span id="s563">This was t -- for a certain time til -- after that the contact with Russia became -- with -- became stronger, and they sent people over to -- to us, and we build a -- in the -- in Alebotska, because we moved each time more towards -- toward west each time, we were in Alebotska forest, they rebuild -- there were two guys who were in our otriad who were -- one was a pilot who -- a former pilot, and the other was one who were working, who was working in a -- on an airfield in ra -- in Russia.</span> <span id="s564">And they were in charge of -- and they chose me to help them because I was Polish -- speaking Polish for -- if we g -- went out into the local places.</span> <span id="s565">And we built a place where planes could land.</span> <span id="s566">And I remember the first plane -- we were building fire -- we build fires between the two -- the fires, they could land, they landed in.</span> <span id="s567">And the first plane was -- bombed a city nearby, and then it -- it landed.</span> <span id="s568">And he brought us TNT, 200 gram pieces.</span> <span id="s569">And after they knew what -- why -- why they were small pieces of ta -- rather than one -- one large, because they wanted us to stop blowing up trains, but blow up the whole railroad, the railroad.</span> <span id="s570">The rails, simply blow.</span> <span id="s571">And we called it after that, concert.</span> <span id="s572">We go to -- for it -- to a concert.</span> <span id="s573">Why?</span> <span id="s574">Because used to go out -- now not eight people [indecipherable], but the whole otriad which was 120 people.</span> <span id="s575">And going along 50 people on one side, 50 on the other side, and along the -- and since the Germans had cut the trees along the railroad on both side for a hundred yards, so that they could hear.</span> <span id="s576">And they build places where they had sitting eight - 10 people every -- every few miles, guards.</span> <span id="s577">The -- we were walking, we yelled hurrah, they were scared and they were running away.</span> <span id="s578">And we were thr -- four people, I was one of the -- of them, who were -- who prepared before that, 200 gram of TNT, and a piece, and a wire, to which you lit the wire.</span> <span id="s579">And when it come here -- a-and when the fire hit the -- it was blowing up.</span> <span id="s580">And it -- in this way, we blew up every -- a rail is approximately seven yards, about seven, eight yards.</span> <span id="s581">So each rail, we were blowing on four lines.</span> <span id="s582">So four guys were -- and four guys were going bi -- a-after me, and they were those who were -- this way to -- to lit these wires.</span> <span id="s583">So here we were -- we were still putting, and there -- and they was blowing boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.</span> <span id="s584">So they called it our concert, we are going to play a con -- and this is how we were blowing up for five - 10 kilometers, and several of the otriads were doing it, so after that, we knew the next day, hey, the Red army will start an offensive.</span> <span id="s585">And indeed, this night, they were starting an offensive, and everything.</span> <span id="s586">No help could come to -- this was a -- their objective.</span> <span id="s587">They said that we will help them much more by blowing up the railroad -- the rails, than killing a few Germans, or -- or -- or killing wa -- or destroying one train.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: Now did you -- did you ha-have guns as well, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: Oh yes, everybody had a gun, and we had machine guns, and we had also cannons, small cannons.</span> <span id="s590">But guns we had, ammunition this was -- came from -- we got it from the peasants, actually.</span> <span id="s591">The peasants were -- did hide all kind of ammunitions which the Russian army -- the Red army left when they were escaping.</span> <span id="s592">And everybody w - was hiding.</span> <span id="s593">And we used from neighbors find out a -- which peasant has a machine gun, or -- or has a -- a cannon.</span> <span id="s594">We used to come them, give us -- to us, or we’ll do this and this and this.</span> <span id="s595">Most of the cases they gave us.</span> <span id="s596">We heard that you have it.</span> <span id="s597">And after that, when we started to get -- we didn’t need really ammunition, we used it sparely, but we had ammunition.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: Well, you mention the -- the -- the peasants.</span> <span id="s599">Were sort of the local people pretty cooperative with you, in terms of, I guess, giving you food --</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: -- or did they -- were they kind of afraid to have you so close by?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: There were various kinds.</span> <span id="s603">Those obviously whose sons were policemen, were -- didn’t like us to -- to [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s604">And we fou -- we found out we cou -- who was, and we used to force them to leave, take away their last -- last -- everything what they have, whether pigs or -- or -- or cows, and -- so that they will go into the city where their sons are.</span> <span id="s605">But I -- there remained many -- must -- most of the po -- of the population hated the Germans, too.</span> <span id="s606">Because the Germans started to -- wanted their -- the youn -- young people to go to sl -- take a slave workers to -- to go to Germany, and they prefer that the sons will go into the partisans and ca -- come from time time home to visit them, and to -- and to go to -- to Germany.</span> <span id="s607">So the local population, because of the way -- the attitude of the German [indecipherable] population was friendly to us, most of it.</span> <span id="s608">Except in the area where there were Poles.</span> <span id="s609">Wherever there were White Russians, Belarus, it was -- they were friendly, but where there were Poles, and once were Polish partisans were in various villages, you know, and they were always bothering us.</span> <span id="s610">I never heard about this Polish group that they killed a German, but they were bothering partisans.</span> <span id="s611">So we once encircled them, disarmed them, and told them to go.</span> <span id="s612">And then it became quiet.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: So there -- what I’m hearing is there wasn’t so much cooperation between different partisan groups, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: Oh, between -- between the Russian partisan groups was good cooperation, we never had cooperations with -- with Polish partisan.</span> <span id="s615">Was never good.</span> <span id="s616">Because they considered Russians also as enemies.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: But you also had a common enemy?</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: Yes, this is true, but nevertheless, this is -- was the different attitude of the Polish group which came after that.</span> <span id="s619">But as long as the Polish group were under the influence of the Polish government in England, it was no cooperation.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: Now --</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: And the [indecipherable] local [indecipherable] there was one lady who somehow, she liked me.</span> <span id="s622">I -- I remember I came to the villa -- whenever I came to the village a few times, I came for breakfast, or to eat something, the only thing what you can eat is there, it was milk, eggs, and -- and potatoes.</span> <span id="s623">So she was always to -- to prepare for me, and I remember once I felt I cannot go each time to this lady, and I ate somewhere else.</span> <span id="s624">And after that she came and, “What?</span> <span id="s625">Does somebody’s pot -- egg taste different than my egg?”</span> <span id="s626">Why didn’t I come to her?</span> <span id="s627">And she somehow liked me.</span> <span id="s628">She knew that I am Jewish, and she wanted always -- whenever I came -- came -- to come to eat at her place.</span> <span id="s629">And this was a time where we did not live any more in the forest, but in the villages.</span> <span id="s630">And each village had a partisan as a commander.</span> <span id="s631">And in the forest were only -- we had the hospital in the forest, where our wounded people were -- were -- were.</span> <span id="s632">And people to guard the -- the -- the -- the -- the hospital and so one.</span> <span id="s633">Most of people were in the -- in the villages.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: Were there women in the partisans?</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: Yes, many women, and they were doing the same thing wa -- was men were doing.</span> <span id="s636">In 19 -- it was ’44?</span> <span id="s637">No, ’43, 60,000 Germans came and circled our forest for several days.</span> <span id="s638">And we knew we cannot fight, they came with tanks, and ya -- we’re -- we didn’t have the ammunition what they had.</span> <span id="s639">So we divided ourself into a small group of 10 people, and we said, when we survive, after -- in a months, we said, we’ll meet here or here, in this place.</span> <span id="s640">And I remember our group of 10 people chose an island which was -- around it was marsh, so we knew a -- the Germans will be a-afraid to walk to the marsh, because when you start to walk in a marsh, and you start sinking, you had a funny fee -- you have in a funny feeling that you don’t know when it will stop.</span> <span id="s641">And slowly I -- so another group joined us from another otriad, and we were after that about 30 people, and I was the leader to -- on the way through the marsh because I was the lightest, only.</span> <span id="s642">So if I sank to the knee in the marsh, the heavy guys, or women were sinking to their -- their breast into the mud.</span> <span id="s643">So I chose a way to go, and went on the island.</span> <span id="s644">And we were there for eight days, they encircled us.</span> <span id="s645">The only food we had was blueberries.</span> <span id="s646">It was the only thing what we could eat.</span> <span id="s647">And you could hear the Germans talking, you could hear around the Ukrainians yelling in Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s648">When it became quiet, they went away, we decided we’ll try, and again I was the leader out.</span> <span id="s649">We went out, and -- and I took three guys with me to go in ahead and the remaining were all -- and I remember in one place we came, we saw German soldiers.</span> <span id="s650">And I told them we don’t shoot, but I send -- I’m back to the main group and told them that we have here German soldier, because to run, we don’t have the strength, we were too weak to run.</span> <span id="s651">Yes, we can kill these two -- three guys, and after that, we’ll have to run.</span> <span id="s652">So they let them go by, they -- they said yes, it was a good decision because we -- and I remember I came out to the village t -- the first village [indecipherable] and the peasants who wa -- say, “Hey there are Germans on the other side of the village.</span> <span id="s653">How do you” -- We say, “Give us something to eat,” because otherwise -- I remember they gave us fast, “Go, go.”</span> <span id="s654">They were afraid of us, that they will -- will be seen, I remember I brought something to eat to everybody.</span> <span id="s655">After eight or 10 days we were without food.</span> <span id="s656">And they went away, and then in the German papers, they published -- they showed once the paper, we were getting the paper from the -- from local people I remember, I got in German, I saw hey, I told our lieutenant, Vitezev was his name.</span> <span id="s657">“You are dead, they call you, they -- they had ru -- th-th-they killed you.”</span> <span id="s658">So I told him he -- “So somewhere how do we show them that we are alive?”</span> <span id="s659">“Let’s go out and blow a train up.”</span> <span id="s660">“You are right.”</span> <span id="s661">So we went and blew a train up.</span> <span id="s662">So they are sure that we are still al-alive, and then -- and then after that we stopped, I remember, this was the last train.</span> <span id="s663">We stopped after that because we had all to do -- to make concerts only.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: Now, we’re talking about this many years later, but you’re expressing a real sense of kind of adventure, and -- and ther -- a -- a certain elation about it right now.</span> <span id="s665">It must have been scary.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: It wa -- it was.</span> <span id="s667">Oh, it was scary, and it was -- on the other hand it was elation that I have a gun, too.</span> <span id="s668">That I’ll not be led to be killed.</span> <span id="s669">That I’ll kill somebody before, you know, I’ll be killed.</span> <span id="s670">This feeling was what gave -- gave us the desire to -- to -- to continue.</span> <span id="s671">And th -- revenge [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s672">I did kill many after that.</span> <span id="s673">When the German army came close, we were afraid, I remember still at that time that we thought, oh, we will not survive the war, this -- because we cannot fight tanks, and -- and -- and cannons will come back, a organized army.</span> <span id="s674">But they came split in small groups, we were catching them and killing them.</span> <span id="s675">And I remember one day, Lieutenant Vites -- Vitezev came to me said, “We have here -- we had about hundred soldiers, enough of killing.</span> <span id="s676">I heard that in the next,” -- the city nearby, I forgot the name -- “th-the Red army is over there.</span> <span id="s677">Take them, let them do with them what’s -- what’s,” -- so, the w-were 10 people guarding this hundred German soldiers, there were also White Russian policemen.</span> <span id="s678">We walked towards the city.</span> <span id="s679">We came toward the road and I head tanks.</span> <span id="s680">I said, “Everybody lie down.”</span> <span id="s681">I said to our guys, “If these are German tanks, whatever we’ll say to the -- to the Germans to be quiet, they will not listen, they will jump out, and we run back to the forest.</span> <span id="s682">We don’t wait for -- wi - for them to -- to be coming.</span> <span id="s683">If they are Russian tanks, fine.”</span> <span id="s684">Sure enough -- and I told to the Germans, “You sit quiet, all.</span> <span id="s685">If not, you’ll -- we’ll kill you all.</span> <span id="s686">First you -- you will be killed.”</span> <span id="s687">And then we listened, and then I saw it, it was a Russian tank.</span> <span id="s688">So we stood up, and -- and I remember that they turned -- they thought there are so many Russian sol -- German soldier, they turned toward us, they had machine guns.</span> <span id="s689">And I yelled to them, “Don’t shoot, don’t shoot.”</span> <span id="s690">And they stopped and one yelled out, “Who are you?”</span> <span id="s691">I said, “Partisans.”</span> <span id="s692">The officer jumped out, he -- I remember he kissed me.</span> <span id="s693">“Who are they?”</span> <span id="s694">“German soldiers we are taking,” we told him.</span> <span id="s695">“Taking them to the -- to the city, to,” -- And he sa -- one with another uniform, now who is -- who is this?</span> <span id="s696">And I said, “This is a Russian policeman.”</span> <span id="s697">“And you don’t know what to do with them?”</span> <span id="s698">He took out his gun, shot it.</span> <span id="s699">He says, “You killed your brothers, sisters, and -- and -- and -- and you want now to escape with the Germans?”</span> <span id="s700">This was my first encounter with the German -- with the Russian army.</span> <span id="s701">I took them to the city, they took from us the soldiers.</span> <span id="s702">And a short time later, our group all joined the ru -- the Russian army.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: Now in -- before you join the -- the army -- the -- I’m sort of curious about the make-up, you said that there were women fighting with you.</span> <span id="s704">Did -- and it also sounds like you were sort of the leader of your group.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: Not the leader, I was not -- whenever it came something with German, they -- they used to use me, I was the only one who spoke German.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: What was the age range of the people fighting with you?</span> <span id="s707">Were they all young?</span> <span id="s708">A: From -- from 15 to 55.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: And a couple questions, one is, did you feel any anti-Semitism, and the other one is did you come across family camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: Family?</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: Family camps in the forest.</span> <span id="s712">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: I mean, what happened to all of the --</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A: No, I did not.</span> <span id="s715">We camped, from time to time we met people from Bielskyotrout, which was a Jewish group.</span> <span id="s716">They were -- they were coming out also to select food or what, but I really did not know where they are.</span> <span id="s717">And my attitude was at that time, hey, they are not fighters [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s718">It is all after the war that I realized that they did such a great job, that they saved so many peop-people.</span> <span id="s719">At that time, I was only more -- I was thinking only about how many Germans to kill.</span> <span id="s720">This was my reveng -- revenge.</span> <span id="s721">But myself, I never met th-the camp of Bielsky.</span> <span id="s722">I knew -- I heard that they -- that they -- that the reason that they are people there with women and children.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: Wasn’t there also a -- the Zurin camp as well?</span> <span id="s724">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: Large camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s727">And I did not --</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Q: And you were not treated differently as a Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s729">A: No, with -- with -- within our group, no, but there was a certain amount from -- not from the top.</span> <span id="s730">As I said, this lieutenant who was killed just a -- a month before we met the Ru- Russian army he was killed.</span> <span id="s731">He was one of the -- of the most regar -- highly regarded guys in -- in -- in -- in our otriad.</span> <span id="s732">And there was another Jewish guy, he -- we used to count how many -- how many trains somebody -- everybody participated in blowing up, and he had the highest number of trains blown up, because everybody liked to go with him.</span> <span id="s733">He was very gregarious, singing, dancing, he was the first to find out where some -- where there is vodka in the place, and where there is girls in the evening are assembling, and we -- to go there, and sing with them, and dancing.</span> <span id="s734">So -- and he was also killed just before the end of -- of the -- of -- in ’44, I don’t remember now exactly the months when we met the [indecipherable] there when the Red army came into our place.</span> <span id="s735">We were on our way to go deeper, we were supposed to go deeper to -- in towar -- in p -- in Poland, because the -- the Russian army liked us to be in the back of the German army, because we did a -- a good in -- a good job, apparently.</span> <span id="s736">So we -- we were supposed to go b- backwards when -- when the ger -- ger -- Russian army came.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: There must have been an incredible bond amongst the people within your group, and maybe with other groups as well.</span> <span id="s738">Incredible trust.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: I wouldn’t only -- everybody was for himself actually.</span> <span id="s740">And a e -- we knew that yes, as a groups, and -- was -- matter of fact, one Jewish guy was killed because of -- he was shot by partisans.</span> <span id="s741">He was a member of our -- of our group, and he was standing guard for -- he called me after that, that -- when he was sleeping, it -- with the partisans, somebody took out his bullets.</span> <span id="s742">So when he went on -- he didn’t check if he has it when he went on guard, and the guy who was allegedly working with the Germans -- I don’t know for sure what he was doing, it did open through the roof and try -- and escaped.</span> <span id="s743">And he was sh -- he shot him, but he didn’t have any -- any ammunition.</span> <span id="s744">Till he took out and found am- ammunition and put in, it was al -- he was gone, it was in the forest at night.</span> <span id="s745">And for this, he was shot, because losing a prisoner, they were shooting.</span> <span id="s746">Losing a rifle, they were shooting.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: So it was a very sort of strong code of --</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: Yeah, and I remember once I was -- ma -- myself in a sled -- in -- in -- in -- horse and sled, and suddenly I realized -- and I was drinking there in -- in a place, and going to -- to another place, [indecipherable] hey, hey, my rifle.</span> <span id="s749">I lost it.</span> <span id="s750">I turned around and back, and it was two yar -- two miles away, it was laying in the middle of the road.</span> <span id="s751">And I saved myself -- and this was the last time I drank vodka.</span> <span id="s752">Because -- and afterward I saw most of -- these two guys who were -- were mentioned, wa -- th-they were killed also, because they -- they were killed because they were drinking, drunk.</span> <span id="s753">More partisans were killed because of vodka than because of real fights.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Q: You mean because of other partisans deciding they were too big of a risk?</span></p> <p><span id="s755">A: No, th-they were always -- they were killed by -- by Germans or Ukrainians, but their actions were limited because of the -- of -- they were drunk.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: And you also s -- you also indicated that there was a certain amount of socializing and fraternizing when you weren’t fighting.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: Yes, with the local population always coming in, and most of them, use -- in the evening used to sometime girls sit together and -- and knit.</span> <span id="s758">So we were looking for a place a -- in there we used to sing together, and -- and -- because the local population was very pos -- positive to us.</span> <span id="s759">I me -- as I mentioned there were some of our men who were member -- who lived, who had their parents and sisters nearby.</span> <span id="s760">So -- so there was a -- the rel- relationship was good of the local, except, as I said, if they were just pure Poles, then it was a different situation.</span> <span id="s761">But there were not -- but there were not many, because we were not yet in Poland.</span> <span id="s762">We were all -- everything was in Belarus.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: But that must have added a little bit of balance to the kind of seriousness of your mission.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: Oh, we never doubted about the seriousness, but it gave a certain amount of -- I knew a lot of Russian songs, just because listening to them singing and dancing.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Q: Let’s change tapes.</span> <span id="s766">End of Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Q: Okay, well, I think we were talking about your experience with the partisans, and I don’t know if there’s anything else you want to add before moving on.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: No.</span> <span id="s770">There were a -- there were a couple of Jewish families who were close by hidden in the fore -- in the forest, and they were joined into our group.</span> <span id="s771">So in this way there were tow -- this was toward the end they were joined into -- into our -- but nothing special.</span> <span id="s772">I was -- I did not have any contact specially with Jews, or with any Jewish organizations.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: What time period are we talking about now?</span> <span id="s774">A: This is -- this is as a partisan.</span> <span id="s775">I did not know --</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: Right, but -- but what date -- I mean, how fa -- how far along are we?</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: This was till spring ’44.</span> <span id="s778">This is when -- through ’43, ’44.</span> <span id="s779">’43 was when they were stir -- when we were still in the forest, I circled what I had d-described, and after that through the winter, and in the spring ’44, the red a -- the -- the army came close.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Q: Okay, then I -- I guess I have one -- one question and then I -- I’d like you to continue.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">You describe that at some point, and I think this was sometime in 1943, the Soviet partisans were then really working under the command of Moscow, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: And that’s when you built the airstrip, and -- A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q: And did your operations, an-and to some extent I guess your -- your goals changed, but did -- did it feel different?</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A: No.</span> <span id="s786">The only thing was it was felt that we are now a part of helping the -- the army.</span> <span id="s787">And that we are not doing just in order to kill here and there a German to be -- be c -- in scaring them, or frightening them, that we are doing a job in cooperation with the -- with the army.</span> <span id="s788">Because it was not important for them that we blow up somewhere a -- more a train or less a train, only they needed it at the time, at certain times when -- especially when -- when the offensive were.</span> <span id="s789">And indeed, after a short time, the German army ran out of railroads.</span> <span id="s790">And they had to take -- they didn’t have any more fall lines going back and forth in the place where we were, but to fix two lines, they had to -- to stop other places.</span> <span id="s791">So it was of a help.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: Through this contact with Moscow, did you have much information on what was happening in the war, or what was happening in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s793">A: No, not much, not much.</span> <span id="s794">We only wanted to know every f -- we were -- we could only hear a -- that the army approaches, that it is closer, and that they -- we knew what was happening in Stalingrad, and -- and that Red army is coming close, and this is where our fear was, that we will not be able to survive it.</span> <span id="s795">It’s ta -- especially remember in one of the villages, a girl was hit in the leg.</span> <span id="s796">And a -- a partisan was cleaning his -- his rifle, and accidentally shot, and hit a girl who will pass by, and she happened to be a -- a girl -- a Jewish girl from Moscow.</span> <span id="s797">And we took her to our hospital in the for -- into the forest, where we sho -- she was recuperating.</span> <span id="s798">And I remember the -- we were all afraid and she re -- and she wi -- or da -- will she be able to survive, she cannot walk, and -- but everything turned out well, and she siz -- I saw her going back to Moscow.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: So I’ll let you continue here.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A: So when we joined the -- when we joined in the Red army, we were ap -- certain grou -- certain people remained.</span> <span id="s801">The guy who was in charge of the -- of the -- there was a Jewish guy who was in -- in charge of several villages.</span> <span id="s802">As I mentioned we were in the villages, and -- and there were Jewish -- and there were partisan commanders of the religious and so on.</span> <span id="s803">He lay -- stayed for -- they formed the local, future government of the area.</span> <span id="s804">And the remaining all -- the whole group joined the -- the -- the army.</span> <span id="s805">And I was sort -- separated from most of the people because I broke my glasses.</span> <span id="s806">And I waited for a pair of glasses to get -- to come in.</span> <span id="s807">So they all went to the front, and I stayed, waited, and I joined after that, another group, and -- when my glasses came.</span> <span id="s808">After a certain time, I remember we were in Prussia, the -- I met this Abrusha with whom I es-escaped from the first -- and who -- with whom I joined this -- the group.</span> <span id="s809">And I still remember he was already a lieutenant in the army, advanced.</span> <span id="s810">And I called him [indecipherable] he was, Abrusha, Abrusha.</span> <span id="s811">And he looked at me.</span> <span id="s812">He said, “I am not Abrusha any more, I am now Alexander.”</span> <span id="s813">So a -- a Jewish guy did not want to be called Abrusha, always wanted to be Alexander.</span> <span id="s814">But he was a advanced as a lieutenant, and was with the army.</span> <span id="s815">And I went till -- Berlin with the army, till when the war was over.</span> <span id="s816">The first Americans I met there.</span> <span id="s817">Unfortunately I did not know English, I couldn’t speak.</span> <span id="s818">And there were very few Jewish guys whom I could speak Yiddish with, fluently.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">Q: Did you have -- when you were with the Soviet army, I mean, were there skirmishes, what were you doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s820">A: Oh, in the fights?</span> <span id="s821">No, I was at that time put, because of my glasses, not in the front line, but in the second line.</span> <span id="s822">So I was in -- after cleaning up various places, blowing up remaining, cause they did not want to have any ammunition left so the Poles will not use them, or the -- the Germans will not use them like we do.</span> <span id="s823">Although germ -- most of the Germans escaped, or were sent out.</span> <span id="s824">Were no Germans when we came to Prussia, there -- there -- it was German free.</span> <span id="s825">So I was not really on the first line any more.</span> <span id="s826">And -- and after that in Berlin I was told I can go in May 1945, I can go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Q: Did you liberate Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s828">A: I did not fight for Berlin actually, but I was there when -- when Berlin was [indecipherable], a week later I was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: What was it like?</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: It was like any city, a lot of German people, and [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s831">I remember I stayed in Salendorf, and they were like a-all other, any other German.</span> <span id="s832">They did not pretend that they did not know, I did not try to talk to them about the Jews.</span> <span id="s833">They were trying to survive, also, cause everything -- was a shortage of everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Q: How did you feel?</span></p> <p><span id="s835">A: Oh, I -- I felt elated that I am in the city.</span> <span id="s836">When I walked, I say, hey not enough -- not enough houses were destroyed.</span> <span id="s837">Was not enough bomb -- not enough bombs fell.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: But all of these years you spent in the forest, before that in a ghetto, did you ri -- did you ever think you’d see that day?</span></p> <p><span id="s839">A: I -- no, I -- I -- as a matter of fact, I remember when I was in the forest, I dreamt about will I be ever -- will -- will there come a day when I’ll be able to walk not in mud, but on -- on -- on concrete, or on asphalt?</span> <span id="s840">I couldn’t believe that this will come.</span> <span id="s841">So this -- here -- I saw it was hey, it came.</span> <span id="s842">I didn’t believe that -- that the day will come, that I’ll survive it.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: What were your sort of initial thoughts or plans, once you were essentially free?</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: Some were -- to see -- get back to -- to -- with the family, and take them out for -- from Rakichenka, from the frost -- from the frost, from the cold air, and start a new life.</span> <span id="s845">How it will be, I did not know.</span> <span id="s846">I hoped it will be able, maybe, since my sister was in -- and uncle, my mother’s grandparents were in -- in Palestine already, in Israel.</span> <span id="s847">I thought, hey, maybe we’ll go there, if we’ll be able to.</span> <span id="s848">So this was the idea of coming back.</span> <span id="s849">First to go out from everybody, and the -- there Russians were organizing trains, group of people who survived, and -- in Russia, and were going into Poland.</span> <span id="s850">And on certain stations these trains stopped, and I used to go out there, where are you from, where are you from?</span> <span id="s851">Is there anybody from such place, such pla -- we used to go in to meet and talk, and everybody was trying to start a new life, what will be, I -- nobody knew.</span> <span id="s852">They brought us to Stettin, which was -- which was a German city emptied of Germans, but were Poles brought in.</span> <span id="s853">And they brought also Jews from -- from Russia.</span> <span id="s854">And as -- f-first time I saw again anti-Semitism, again.</span> <span id="s855">Openly were anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s856">And I always thought -- regretted, hey why did I return my -- my pistol?</span> <span id="s857">Why didn’t I keep the pistol I took from the first German officer I killed?</span> <span id="s858">Till a certain time, we were s-several months in -- in Stettin, and I heard that people are being moved, and moving out more east to Germany.</span> <span id="s859">And I -- accidentally I saw something written in the -- in Hebrew, on a -- and it was astonishing [indecipherable] in Hebrew, I went in, and I saw people were speaking Hebrew, and they ask me why I [indecipherable] I’m a former partisan [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s860">They ask me if I can help them get a train, that they have 70 children, and they would like to get a train to Kraków from Stettin, north to south.</span> <span id="s861">And I told them I’ll try, if -- but if, then I would like also to be moved with my family.</span> <span id="s862">And they said it’s a deal.</span> <span id="s863">And I had no difficulty, just mentioning in the local office, the names from Berlin, whom I knew from -- who were in charge of -- big shots in the government, if -- I asked them if I should -- if they can arrange for me, or should I call comrade so and so.</span> <span id="s864">And they said, “Hey, how do you know them?”</span> <span id="s865">I said, “Oh, we were fighting together.”</span> <span id="s866">Said, “Oh.</span> <span id="s867">Next week will be okay?”</span> <span id="s868">They were waiting already for two months for a -- for -- and couldn’t get.</span> <span id="s869">Said, “Will be great.”</span> <span id="s870">Next week there was a train.</span> <span id="s871">So they ask me if I can be with the children till they come -- until -- till Kraków.</span> <span id="s872">I told them, okay, I will, and -- and this is where I -- when I heard already that Jewish people are being killed on the trains.</span> <span id="s873">This is where I regretted that the Polish partisan were stopping trains and killing Jews and Russians.</span> <span id="s874">And a matter of fact, one guy who survived the war from Berlin -- from Minsk ghetto, and he was killed when he -- he came to his hometown to visit.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">Survived partisans and then came, he was killed by Poles.</span> <span id="s876">But this was the way how we - they took my two sisters to one way, and my mother, brothers, and my sister and me went the other way.</span> <span id="s877">We came to Berlin, and we were in a DP camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: Wait, I’m getting confused.</span> <span id="s879">First -- did you go to kra -- you went to Kraków?</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A: I went to Kraków, went back, and -- and a few days later, we were transferred.</span> <span id="s881">But my two sisters were taken, they say that they -- they don’t -- cannot take so many people to -- to Berlin, so they were taken through the south, and they ended up after that, I found out, in Austria.</span> <span id="s882">And my mother, two brothers, and my sister and me were in -- no in, not sister -- were in -- yes, one sister -- were in ber -- in -- ended up in Berlin, and we were in to -- taken into a DP camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">Q: Okay, but before this happened, didn’t you have to go -- how did your mother get there?</span> <span id="s884">I mean, didn’t you have to go find her or something?</span> <span id="s885">I mean, how did all of a sudden your family get together again?</span></p> <p><span id="s886">A: Oh, we were -- from Russia we came, the whole family came by train to Stettin.</span> <span id="s887">So in Stettin we were all together.</span> <span id="s888">We were after that separated, the two sisters had -- to -- t -- the Bricha took them to another place, and they ended up in -- in Austria.</span> <span id="s889">And we are remaining where in Berlin.</span> <span id="s890">And by our letters we found out, because we both wrote to Israel to my sister and back, and we found out that they are there.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">Q: So before you went to Stettin, you -- your -- your mother had come -- your parents had come over from -- from that town in the Urals?</span></p> <p><span id="s892">A: Yes, I -- this is where I went to to take them out.</span> <span id="s893">I said that I went --</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Q: Oh, you didn’t describe that, I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s895">I -- you told me about that before the interview, but I don’t think you’ve described that, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A: At the end of the war, I went there [indecipherable] this was May, ’95.</span> <span id="s897">Q: ’45.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: ’45.</span> <span id="s899">I went to -- I went -- I wa -- I was let go -- I ca -- you can go where, and I had tickets to go to Rakichenka.</span> <span id="s900">But on the way, I st -- I went to Moscow, because my sister and brother-in-law, they were working in the Polish embassy in Moscow.</span> <span id="s901">So I stay with them one month, and then I ended up -- this was in the meantime, June -- July, I ended up going back to Rakichenka, September, and I came to -- the train came 10 kilometer before Rakichenka, and it was stopped, because in s -- in September it was -- there was three feet snow.</span> <span id="s902">I tried to walk, since I was accustomed to walking, and -- and snow, but it was too difficult, and I didn’t know where to go, so I remember that in this place, there were once pol -- Polish Jews living in a certain house, I went there and knocked.</span> <span id="s903">Sure enough they were still there, and they knew that I am supposed to come, cause they knew my sister who was a nurse, who helped nursing as their -- their father when he was sick.</span> <span id="s904">So I stayed with them, and the next day I -- I walked to Rakichenka.</span> <span id="s905">And it took several months till the papers were ready.</span> <span id="s906">They were ready to give me my job back at the -- at the construction company where I worked.</span> <span id="s907">They heard that I came back, that I -- if I want to work at doing things, I want to go back to Poland.</span> <span id="s908">And to let -- they were organize trains with refugees, with Jew -- Jewish people, and Polish people.</span> <span id="s909">They were all in the meantime also Polish people in this place, who were forced.</span> <span id="s910">And I remember they came to me, if I can help -- they organized a Polish school there, if I can help them teach math.</span> <span id="s911">And I said okay.</span> <span id="s912">So then -- so I was teaching there mathematics in this -- in this school.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Arithmetic, actually, till we could -- all went back to Poland.</span> <span id="s914">They stayed in Kraków -- they went to Kraków, and we went Stettin.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">Q: Well it’s just kind of amazing that you really were able to reconnect with most of your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: It’s unusual, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A: Yes, unfortunately, my brother-in-law and sister were -- my brother-in-law was looking for his little girl, and he couldn’t find her.</span> <span id="s919">The place was closed, the orphanage, and he found one who worked in the orphanage there, and she said allegedly that she passed away.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">Q: And your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s921">A: My father got a har -- heart attack and passed away in -- in there, in Russia.</span> <span id="s922">And he her -- he did not know even that I am alive, because he thought he lost my sister and me and then -- and another brother of mine, and sister passed away over there also.</span> <span id="s923">My brother was drowned where he worked in Russia, and my sister passed away, the oldest.</span> <span id="s924">So my father after that got a heart attack.</span> <span id="s925">And they couldn’t believe it when -- because at first -- there’s a first pilot that landed in -- in our Malabotska forest, I send with him a letter.</span> <span id="s926">And he send it to them, and they couldn’t believe it, that I am alive.</span> <span id="s927">And after that they got letter also, from my sister, and my brother-in-law what they came over.</span> <span id="s928">So this how we got contact again.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q: So you and your mother, and I’m not sure who else, went to this DP camp in Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: Yes, my two brothers, and -- and my two brothers, yeah, they went in a DP camp.</span> <span id="s931">And in ’48, I started to look a -- I heard that there are some people who start to -- to go to university in Berlin.</span> <span id="s932">I said hey, I’ll try.</span> <span id="s933">Went, applied, passed the exam and was accepted.</span> <span id="s934">So I started to study in ’48.</span> <span id="s935">In ’49, they closed the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Q: What was living in the camp like?</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: Oh, here was already a Jewish organization, because they were all Jews in the camp.</span> <span id="s938">And there was a -- a Jewish local paper we were getting out, and Jewish school organized, Jewish physicians, and it was everything Jewish already.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: Were there camp survivors there?</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: There were some, but most of them were like -- like -- people like my -- from Russian Jews, and je -- Polish Jews from Russia who survived the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: When you first started to learn -- how did y -- when you first started learning about what had happened in -- in Poland, primarily, but certainly west of where you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s942">A: Yeah, this was when I was in the -- in the Russian army, started to read, and -- and I came to various cities, and nowhere were Jews.</span> <span id="s943">As a matter of fact, I even passed as a soldier our city, Plasnich.</span> <span id="s944">Came in -- we were supposed to go in toward Prussia, which was -- Prussia was near the border.</span> <span id="s945">So I asked my officer a -- if I can go in, so he went with me.</span> <span id="s946">I am interested.</span> <span id="s947">And I saw a neighbor in the street, and I stopped him, how are you, and -- and I asked him, whose -- who is here, if any Jews survived, he said no.</span> <span id="s948">And he told me there is only one Jewish guy who survived, and -- and he was hidden by a Polish girl, who he married after that.</span> <span id="s949">So there were no Jews.</span> <span id="s950">So I couldn’t stay long.</span> <span id="s951">And I went and never -- never went back.</span> <span id="s952">And I didn’t want after that to go back to Poland, because all the cities we passed, no Jews.</span> <span id="s953">The first Jewish guys I saw was in -- in -- in Berlin.</span> <span id="s954">I was walking once on the street, and somebody s -- pass by, and said umhoit?</span> <span id="s955">And I looked at him -- in the beginning, I -- and then I thought, hey, umhoit means in Hebrew, your folk - your -- your -- your people, your folk.</span> <span id="s956">I -- I said yes [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s957">He said yes he’s a -- a survivor of here, and he thought that I am Jewish, so he -- where he is, he told me there is here a group of people who survived the war, and I don’t know -- he didn’t know yet what -- what will be, this was in -- m -- in the beginning, when ber -- when Berlin was taken.</span> <span id="s958">I remember I had a can -- a can with me of -- we were getting American food in cans, was -- and I had it, and I gave it to him.</span> <span id="s959">Oh, he thanked me.</span> <span id="s960">And this was the first time when I saw a Jewish person after the war.</span> <span id="s961">And I -- at that time I realized what -- what happened, and -- and I was near Berlin, was some kind of a camp, I don’t remember today, and I -- I was there a few -- few minute, I could not be -- until -- for a long time I could not hear anything about Holocaust, because I’ve had -- when I -- I had mentioned to you during -- I -- later when I -- when I was a student at the Berlin University, for a long time I could not -- I had -- for a week or two weeks that I did not sleep at all, that each time either Gorajetski was chasing me and shooting at me again, or I was chasing Germans, and I couldn’t sleep.</span> <span id="s962">And it happened also in the United States in the beginning, too.</span> <span id="s963">And I cut off all contact with my former friends, and -- with whom I studied in Berlin, and -- and it went away, and it cured me.</span> <span id="s964">So when the DP camp was liquid -- closed in Berlin because of the -- it was approaching, I believe the -- encirclement of Berlin, berl Berlin -- blockade of Berlin, they took out all the people towar -- to West Germany, but I st -- I came back because of -- because of I want to -- I started to study, so I wanted to continue, that’s all.</span> <span id="s965">And I had an abur -- ability to -- a Jewish group started to build in -- in -- in Berlin, so I was a -- earning a little money by teaching Hebrew, and -- and I didn’t pay for most of the -- for college.</span> <span id="s966">For I thought a -- I will never have such conditions to -- to -- to continue, and so I’ll stay.</span> <span id="s967">So I stayed to graduate.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">Q: Were you in -- in university with German students, with --</span></p> <p><span id="s969">A: Mostly German student, and most of the students were -- were former soldiers.</span> <span id="s970">Matter of fact, during lunch hour -- after that this was post-graduation study.</span> <span id="s971">We used to eat, our group, always together lunch -- eat lunch together, and I used to sit -- mostly there were two girls, with the girls, because there we -- the men were always talking about the war, certain aspect of the war.</span> <span id="s972">And once the assistant professor came in, and he started to -- and he said, I remember, oh, in 1942, it was -- yeah, four -- no, ’43, he is -- finally received permission to go back, and he wanted to go for Christmas home.</span> <span id="s973">But when he came to eastern Europe, and the darn partisan blew up his train.</span> <span id="s974">And he couldn’t -- he did not reach.</span> <span id="s975">And I asked him, “Herr Doctor, when was it?”</span> <span id="s976">And he said the -- a date, and he started to describe what happened.</span> <span id="s977">I said, “It wasn’t like this.”</span> <span id="s978">I said, “It was the different way.”</span> <span id="s979">And he said, “Somewhere, how do you know what happened to me in 1943, over there?”</span> <span id="s980">“So, because it was me who put the mine and blew the train up.”</span> <span id="s981">“What, do you kill Germans?”</span> <span id="s982">I said, “Yes, killed many of them.”</span> <span id="s983">They ca -- didn’t want to believe.</span> <span id="s984">And he said, “You have to go -- to come,” -- this was also before Christmas, “you have to come and meet my wife, and tell -- tell her.”</span> <span id="s985">And I still remember she asked me else, “What would have been if you had met at that time?”</span> <span id="s986">And I told her, “I don’t know if I would have survived, but your husband would have been dead.”</span> <span id="s987">I said, “Because every German who approached the place where we were sitting, we kept him on our -- nothing -- he would have been dead.</span> <span id="s988">If we would have survived after that, I don’t know, but the first thing is we would have shot him.”</span> <span id="s989">Just was -- I remember that encounter because this was a special case where we were all trying to blow up a train, and suddenly -- usually we were blowing up trains going to the front, and s-suddenly we heard somebody hey, a group of partisans, unknown to us, were sitting about a mile away, and they blew up the train, who were going to -- toward east.</span> <span id="s990">And they were full of Germans after that on the railroad, and we didn’t know, we could not go there, try to -- to take it out, straighten the mine out, and we didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s991">And suddenly a t -- a train started to come in the other direction.</span> <span id="s992">So I said, “To hell with it, we’ll blow up this one.”</span> <span id="s993">Rather than -- than leave the mine, or -- so this is how this was a peculiar case.</span> <span id="s994">And we blew up the train coming from the front, to in -- where he was sitting.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Q: What about -- I mean, just in general your relationship with German students?</span> <span id="s996">I mean, your feeling toward them, how they treated you?</span></p> <p><span id="s997">A: No, whenever I met a German, the first -- the first -- unconsciously the first question was how many women, how many children did he kill?</span> <span id="s998">And so this was my relationship toward.</span> <span id="s999">I knew I am here for a purpose, in order to get a degree, and -- and get out.</span> <span id="s1000">I did not develop any close friendship with anyone, no one.</span> <span id="s1001">Especially when I considered they were all Nazis, because after that, during the Nuremburg trials, I remember two other guys were in the -- in my lab, and we started to talk, and they said, “Yavolt, we lost the war, so they are suing our -- our leaders.</span> <span id="s1002">Had we won, we would have sued the American leaders.”</span> <span id="s1003">From this attitude, I’ll never forget this.</span> <span id="s1004">I considered that they are -- in heart that they are all Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">Q: Did you experience any, sort of blatant anti-Semitism after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">A: After the war, no.</span> <span id="s1007">Only my attitude was to resist, especially when I heard such and such a professor, oh yes, he published a book, but he stole everything from -- from a Jewish book, which was from a Jewish professor of o -- at least this is what I was told.</span> <span id="s1008">So whenever I went before a -- before a -- as I said, examination, I was always sleepless.</span> <span id="s1009">But I managed to -- to -- my first room I rented, I was -- I rented in a Russian girl -- in a Russian lady.</span> <span id="s1010">Why?</span> <span id="s1011">Because I wanted to find if they know anything about a person named Gorajetski, because I thought, if I’ll find Gorajetski, he’ll not -- he’ll not live long if I’ll find.</span> <span id="s1012">But they did not know anything.</span> <span id="s1013">And after that I was with a -- another family who were very nice to me, they cooked for me, treated me nicely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">Q: A German family?</span> <span id="s1015">A: German family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">Q: What did you study?</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">A: I studied chemistry, and afterwards I received a PhD in chemistry.</span> <span id="s1018">And when I came -- visited Israel, and I asked for a job, they told me, “We have so many chemists that you can put the,” [indecipherable] that -- like tar on their -- “you can pave the streets with them”.</span> <span id="s1019">So I said -- and my sister was -- and brother-in-law, they got a job in the Washington embassy.</span> <span id="s1020">And when they were told to go back, they asked for asylum, and stayed here.</span> <span id="s1021">So they wrote me, “Come here, come to -- to United States.”</span> <span id="s1022">So I started to study English, and after a few months English, I came to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Q: This was when?</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">A: 1956.</span> <span id="s1025">And I got one job in Massachusetts, was there for a year and a half, and after that, the central laboratories were in Philadelphia, so I moved to Philadelphia, because in a small place in Massachusetts, there was nothing for a single person to do.</span> <span id="s1026">I used to go drive to New York.</span> <span id="s1027">And my sister live in Washington, I thought, hey, Philadelphia is in the between.</span> <span id="s1028">So I moved to Philadelphia, and since then I am in Philadelphia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">Q: Now, for -- since all of this time, you’ve gotten married, you’ve raised a family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">A: Oh, I -- I was going every -- from to -- since my mother was in -- in Israel, and my two brothers were in Israel, [indecipherable] f -- in ’48, my two brothers volunteered to go to fight for Israel.</span> <span id="s1031">And they went, and they volunteered.</span> <span id="s1032">They asked me to come with them, and I said, “No, I had enough, one war.</span> <span id="s1033">And I am now studying, I am not -- I’ll not leave till I graduate.”</span> <span id="s1034">So I used to go to visit, and I -- from here I was going to visit my mother and brothers there.</span> <span id="s1035">And on one of the visits, I me -- met my wife, we got married, and sh -- t -- I brought her -- brought them here -- brought her here.</span> <span id="s1036">I tried to get a job there, I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1037">Although she always says that I didn’t try hard enough.</span> <span id="s1038">And now, my two children were born here.</span> <span id="s1039">One is a physician, the other is a lawyer.</span> <span id="s1040">So we -- we are here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">Q: When you first came over here, was there a -- an adjustment period?</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s1043">I cannot say that I felt immediately a member of -- of the group, it was always -- actually, it was always they.</span> <span id="s1044">Americans, they Americans.</span> <span id="s1045">American Jews, they American Jews.</span> <span id="s1046">It was never we, for a long, long, long time.</span> <span id="s1047">I did not ber -- belong to any group.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">Because I felt always to be that I am an outsider, all the time.</span> <span id="s1049">I don’t know, this -- this is what happened then, during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">Q: Was it lonely, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1052">That’s what always, it -- my life was unique, it was different than everybody else’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">As a matter of fact, and even when -- even Philadelphia I saw there is a group of Holocaust survivors, and the first -- I went only once to a meeting of, and I saw a -- these were mostly people who were -- who survived somehow in Russia somewhere, or ot -- not they -- they did not had to fight for their life, as I did, so I -- so they -- it’s not the same group as I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q: Did people -- did you talk about your past?</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">A: No, I tried -- I talked very little.</span> <span id="s1056">This is the reason why my daughter is here, she wanted to hear -- hear what, because whenever there was -- they mentioned in television the Holocaust, I went out.</span> <span id="s1057">I did not -- only once or twice I talked -- gave a talk in -- in the synagogue, about Jewish partisans, or -- and actually, I was not in a typically Jewish partisan, I was a partisan.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">Q: Did Americans -- people who were already here -- care?</span> <span id="s1059">Did they want to know?</span> <span id="s1060">A: Some found it interesting, but as a whole, not specially.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">Q: And you didn’t want to talk abou t it?</span> <span id="s1062">A: And I didn’t want to talk, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">Q: How long do you think it took you to sort of feel more comfortable with thinking about it, and talking about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">A: Oh, I would say till -- till about a few years ago.</span> <span id="s1065">Took me a long time.</span> <span id="s1066">And this is why I was often in Israel, but the first time I went to see Yad Vashem was last year.</span> <span id="s1067">And this Holocaust museum, only -- only now that I saw it.</span> <span id="s1068">Because the memories were too painful.</span> <span id="s1069">I have seen too many dead children, too many women killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">Q: You basically reestablished yourself with success.</span> <span id="s1071">How much do you think that those war experiences impacted you, and -- and can you kind of talk about in what way they sort of, affected you, in the way you’ve lived your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">A: I don’t know, I -- I wa -- I -- I believe that I became very regre -- regressive, so ha -- I d -- I didn’t talk.</span> <span id="s1073">The first time that I talking about it openly now is -- is -- is now, here.</span> <span id="s1074">I tried always to -- not to talk about it, to hide it, to hide everything what happened to me.</span> <span id="s1075">I don’t know why, but because it hurt.</span> <span id="s1076">I still hate certain areas in j -- and I -- I didn’t mention about this that when I was a student, immediately after Israel was created, I asked my sister to send me how just Jewish money looked like.</span> <span id="s1077">And she sent me one shekel, a five shekel bill, and a 10 or 20, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1078">And at that -- at that time, one -- one shekel was five dollars, so for me this was a fortune, so much money.</span> <span id="s1079">But she send it to me, and I saw each time, whenever I couldn’t sleep, I looked at the money, because the money had on the other side, a Star of David.</span> <span id="s1080">And the Star of David, which was used during the war as a star to deg -- as a sign to degrade people, suddenly here was on the money, and it was -- so I -- when I looked at it, I say, “Oh, I’ll finished -- in a few more years I’ll graduate, and I’ll get away, get out from -- from -- from this country, from Germany.”</span> <span id="s1081">And each time I kept it with me, with -- the money.</span> <span id="s1082">When my mother was supposed to go to Israel, this was during the blockade of Berlin, I -- and she was in West Germany, I wanted to go to say good-bye to her, to say to -- in -- but when I went -- I had onl -- the only way how to go was, for me, was by a plane.</span> <span id="s1083">From anybody from [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1084">So I wanted to buy a ticket, they told me no, I am -- I am a for -- I am not a German.</span> <span id="s1085">So how do I pay?</span> <span id="s1086">Said, “You cannot pay this with foreign -- with dollars, because you are not a r -- a real foreigner.”</span> <span id="s1087">I cannot get a ticket.</span> <span id="s1088">So there was another guy living also at a Polish Jew in my -- in my house, I ask him, “How do Jewish people travel to -- to West Germany?”</span> <span id="s1089">To -- the shortest distance was to Hanover.</span> <span id="s1090">He told me there is here a foreign -- a foreigner -- a real foreigner.</span> <span id="s1091">He told me buy dollars on the Black Market, and he told me where I can buy dollars, and 20 dollars for him.</span> <span id="s1092">And for 20 dollars, he will pay for you.</span> <span id="s1093">And then you’ll be able to go.</span> <span id="s1094">So, I went to him, he said yes, he’ll do it.</span> <span id="s1095">I bought, I don’t remember how -- remember how many dollars, was in 20 dollars for him.</span> <span id="s1096">I pay -- and he paid for me a t-ticket, and I came on the plane from Berlin, and I remember they called me in.</span> <span id="s1097">“You are a smuggler.”</span> <span id="s1098">I had to undress, and they -- the British, that’s what it -- the British part of Berlin.</span> <span id="s1099">And they checked me, they looked for me.</span> <span id="s1100">And at that time I figured, hey, I should have had like -- like with the German maybe, to put something on my legs -- on my -- in my -- so that they’ll not touch [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1101">Because they found in my wallet this -- this money, this Israeli money, they took it away from me.</span> <span id="s1102">I’ll never forget it till today I remember the British.</span> <span id="s1103">They took away because I’m a smuggler.</span> <span id="s1104">I was the only wa -- only Jew on the -- on the -- on the plane, and the only smuggler.</span> <span id="s1105">And I lost the money.</span> <span id="s1106">If I had known that they will, ah, I could have hidden it in a book or somewhere.</span> <span id="s1107">I was in -- in trying to smuggle in things, I was a specialist, I knew how to do it.</span> <span id="s1108">I didn’t expect it.</span> <span id="s1109">But I’ll never forget the British for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">Q: What I wanted to ask you about at this point, is sort of, kind of general, more personal and philosophical sort of reactions to your experience, and I think how it formed you after the war.</span> <span id="s1111">We can do one of two things, we can, you know, probably for another half hour at the most.</span> <span id="s1112">We can stop and take lunch, and do this afterwards if you’d like, or what -- however -- whatever you’d like to do.</span> <span id="s1113">And we can take a break.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">Q: Would you like to do that, and then just come back for a half hour or so?</span> <span id="s1116">A: Yes, yes, I will --</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">Q: When you come ba --</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">A: I will see what they do over there at [indecipherable] End of Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">Q: Just wanted to pick up a little bit with how these experiences during the war impacted you after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">A: It took me a long time to forget that the war is over, and I tried always to remind me, Sam, the war is over.</span> <span id="s1122">For instance, whenever somebody asked me a question, automatically I was thinking, is it better to -- to answer in this way, or the other way.</span> <span id="s1123">A simple thing.</span> <span id="s1124">How old are you?</span> <span id="s1125">I was always automatically thinking -- thinking -- thinking, should I say I’m five years older, or should I say I’m few years younger?</span> <span id="s1126">I never thought about tell the truth, because always I thought a -- what is better?</span> <span id="s1127">Is it in this situation better to by younger, or is it to be older?</span> <span id="s1128">And on any question like this, I never - automatically I did -- my -- my head worked in this way, which answer is better, not what is the truth, to answer truly.</span> <span id="s1129">And after that, I realized, Sam, the war is over, you can tell the truth.</span> <span id="s1130">And took me a long time, till I overcame this thinking, that you can answer, there is no danger any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">Q: Now, wa -- was this because you always had to manipulate the truth?</span> <span id="s1132">Was this because you didn’t trust people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">A: Oh, both.</span> <span id="s1134">Mostly it was because to manipulate was better.</span> <span id="s1135">In some places it was better to be younger, let’s say, cause then you’ll be able -- in other places was better to be older, then there -- then you can do in ghetto.</span> <span id="s1136">These things still remained, and I -- as I said, this was automatic with me.</span> <span id="s1137">I had to fight to -- to a -- you can tell the truth, there -- they -- there is no danger any more.</span> <span id="s1138">Because still I was thinking there is a danger in -- in -- lurking somewhere.</span> <span id="s1139">And I had to fight this myself to answer the truth, to tell the truth.</span> <span id="s1140">To forget about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">Q: What else?</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">A: Also trusting people.</span> <span id="s1143">It was very difficult to.</span> <span id="s1144">Somehow you have to real -- I had to rea -- you have to rely on yourself, not to trust other people.</span> <span id="s1145">Took me also a long time to.</span> <span id="s1146">And even -- even making friends.</span> <span id="s1147">I believe this was all the results of bitter experiences.</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">Q: Do you think that your sort of priorities, your values maybe are different because of what you went through?</span> <span id="s1149">Or were shaped by what you went through?</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">A: No, the priorities was always -- first thing was safety.</span> <span id="s1151">Automatically I was think, hey, what is safer?</span> <span id="s1152">In anything what I did.</span> <span id="s1153">From walking somewhere, to -- to going for trips.</span> <span id="s1154">Safety was always the first thing I was la -- I was thinking of.</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">Q: To an extreme?</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">A: To -- even to extremes.</span> <span id="s1157">But it a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">Q: Do you feel safe now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1160">Now this went away.</span> <span id="s1161">But took me -- it took me time to -- to overcome it, because I was recognizing myself, hey, there is no danger Sam, any more.</span> <span id="s1162">You -- and I talking to myself, and I say, so the war is over, the war is over.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">Q: Do you think that -- that your experiences affected the way you raised your children, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">A: Not that I think now about it, although I -- I worried often about the safety, not saying anything maybe.</span> <span id="s1165">But maybe I was overcautious in various area, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1166">But it definitely -- I wa -- I was i -- always think, hey is this -- is it safe, can they go somewhere on a -- to a camp?</span> <span id="s1167">Who will -- is it safe to be in the camp?</span> <span id="s1168">And so on.</span> <span id="s1169">I had to think it over.</span> <span id="s1170">I di -- I didn’t talk about it, but I was thinking to myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">Q: What were some of the other difficulties in kind of adjusting to a new life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">A: I cannot think, because I had all the time -- had to adjust each time, to adjust to a different language, or to -- because in the beginning everything was -- let’s say I was raised in Poland, Polish, and after that to adjust everything in Russian, then I was adjusting back to Polish, then to German, and after that were ex -- exa -- to -- to -- to English.</span> <span id="s1173">And -- so it was adjusting was constantly.</span> <span id="s1174">I was doing it all the time, till here I thought I am now -- I am here, I am an -- an American now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">Q: What about culturally here?</span> <span id="s1176">You mentioned that you felt a bit apart, but -- but what else, anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">A: This -- this -- I believe this was all the time that I belong to -- as I said I could not -- never say we, you’re -- we are.</span> <span id="s1178">In other word, for a certain group to say we, we belong.</span> <span id="s1179">We Americans, or we -- because I was always -- considered myself, it is they, and I am different.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">A: And I probably did not overcome this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">Q: Are you -- are you religious now, or have -- di-did you raise your children Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">A: Yes, we belong to a synagogue, and -- and actually it was -- in the beginning I could not go to a synagogue.</span> <span id="s1184">In -- in Berlin, let’s say whenever there was a Jewish holiday, I did not go to -- to -- simply to show a -- I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s1185">And I used to go to the synagogue, but I was always outside, not going in -- in to -- to pray, because I understood Hebrew -- I understand Hebrew, I learned Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1186">And whenever there was written, God is full of mercy, I could not see where -- where he was.</span> <span id="s1187">I saw th -- the -- that children, and that -- that people.</span> <span id="s1188">So, I could not pray for a long, long time.</span> <span id="s1189">But after that, here, when I thought, yeah, if I will not go to a synagogue, and my wife wanted the children to be raised [indecipherable], if not, then they will become -- they’ll stop being Jewish.</span> <span id="s1190">So I agreed yes, we’ll go to a synagogue, and we belonged to a synagogue since then, and we tried to raise our children Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">Q: Is this important?</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1193">Yes, because this is a way how e -- how they can stay Jewish.</span> <span id="s1194">In Poland you could be Jewish without being religious.</span> <span id="s1195">In Israel you can be Jewish without being religious.</span> <span id="s1196">But in the United States, if you don’t belong to a synagogue, and you don’t na -- then you stop being Jewish.</span> <span id="s1197">So this is important.</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">Q: What do you think gave you, sort of the courage, and the strength to get through all of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">A: In the beginning it was a will to survive, so see again my -- my parents.</span> <span id="s1200">To see my brothers and sister.</span> <span id="s1201">At a certain time it was -- a certain amount was a desire to re -- of revenge.</span> <span id="s1202">And not only it was expected to me -- from me, I remember in the Red army, when we entered the first German village, and there were only a couple of old people remained in the village, how everybody else ran away.</span> <span id="s1203">And the soldiers come me, “Sam, there are the -- they are still Germans, we should go kill them.”</span> <span id="s1204">And I asked them, [indecipherable] I say, should I?</span> <span id="s1205">I told them, “Why should I kill them?</span> <span id="s1206">They didn’t do anything bad to me.”</span> <span id="s1207">They says, “You are Jewish, didn’t they kill all Jews?”</span> <span id="s1208">And I told them, “So, what do you want me to be like the -- like the German SS, do the same thing?”</span> <span id="s1209">Within myself I saw a -- I cannot do what they did.</span> <span id="s1210">So I had opportunity to kill Germans, but I couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s1211">But there was a certain -- during the war, there was a certain amount of desire for revenge.</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">Q: Was there anything in your upbringing that kind of gave you the s -- the strength you needed to -- to get through this?</span> <span id="s1213">Were there things that you thought about while you were fighting, or that you dreamed about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">A: No, I would not say this, because my father always wanted me to be kind, and -- and -- and -- and -- and understandable of other people need.</span> <span id="s1215">No, I would not say that upbringing did it, it is the experience during the war which made me.</span> <span id="s1216">It is only -- it was one thing that I -- when I was as a partisan walking through the -- at night sometimes, somewhere through the village, and I thought, hey, why did -- how come -- why -- why did not -- I not have a rifle when I was in ghetto?</span> <span id="s1217">I would have felt differently.</span> <span id="s1218">That it will cost somebody s-something to kill me, that they cannot kill just people for -- for nothing, and without paying any -- a price for it.</span> <span id="s1219">So this -- and this is sometimes left -- sometimes when I think about people here having so mu -- so mu -- rifles, and they causing here death, I still sometimes think a -- but if Jews had rifles during -- in 1939, many more Germans would have paid with their life, or Ukrainians for -- for killing them.</span> <span id="s1220">So it’s -- it affects today my thinking that I am not so against -- so much against the National Rifle Organization as may be if I would have not had my experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">Q: What else did you think about while you were in the forest?</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">A: Oh, if I was thinking, I -- it was a dream that I -- that I will one day be sitting here in -- and answer question and tell stories about it.</span> <span id="s1223">I never believed that such a day will come.</span> <span id="s1224">I thought I am destined to be killed, but I want to pay a price -- that they pay a price for killing me.</span> <span id="s1225">But I didn’t believe that I’ll survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">Q: Did you think about your family when you were in the woods, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">A: Oh, always.</span> <span id="s1228">They were always close and I was thanking God that we did not have my -- money -- enough money so the whole family will go to -- to Minsk, otherwise I would have not been able to -- to run away and then -- and this is what happened to a lot of young people who stayed, did not go away because they could not leave their mothers or -- or fathers.</span> <span id="s1229">Because very often, they were supplying the food, you know, for the -- temporarily to s -- to survive, even -- even when a lot of people were hungry, but still the young people were those who were helping them.</span> <span id="s1230">And a lot of them could not go away and leave their parents, or brothers and sisters.</span> <span id="s1231">So I thank God that -- that it -- that only -- that only I was the one who went to Minsk, and they stayed far back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">Q: Are there certain, or were there, I guess, certain things that happened to you here that would evoke certain memories, whether it was a smell, or a sound, or something someone said that all of a sudden would make you think back to these difficult experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">Certain things that just bring out these memories?</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">A: Not particularly, except a few days ago, I was to a meeting where a professor from China gave a -- a speech at Gratts College in -- in -- it’s a Jewish college in -- in Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s1235">And he spoke that they wanted to -- to learn about Jews, and Jewish culture, and so on, because Jews have influence everywhere about -- in -- in -- in money and so on.</span> <span id="s1236">And -- and a -- in business and so on.</span> <span id="s1237">And I thought, hey, where did I hear that Jews have all these influence, worldwide influence?</span> <span id="s1238">It was in the shtillmer where I read it.</span> <span id="s1239">So these kind of thing I wanted to ask, but then --</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">Q: And maybe he was just being complimentary?</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">A: Yes, that they want to get acquainted with Jewish culture, and so on, so [indecipherable], and he gave this as a reason, but there was [indecipherable] yet.</span> <span id="s1242">Jews could not help effect t-to -- to bomb Auschwitz, or -- or -- or other things li-like this, and -- or -- or influence the British to let Patria, and -- and -- and what is the name, the -- the two ships which were blown up after that?</span> <span id="s1243">People tried to escape, and come to Israel.</span> <span id="s1244">They didn’t have the influence at that time, but now, suddenly they have the influence.</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">Q: What else?</span> <span id="s1246">Is there anything that you -- that you want to add?</span> <span id="s1247">I have a good question for you.</span> <span id="s1248">Did -- did working with all of those -- those mines, make you -- make you a better chemist?</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">A: No, I -- but I understood after that what I -- actually I did not want to be a -- as a young man, I did not want to be a chemist.</span> <span id="s1250">As a young man, I loved math, and I wanted to be a mathematician.</span> <span id="s1251">In high school whenever -- every -- we had a free lessons, I used to go to my math professor.</span> <span id="s1252">They -- all the kids were go -- were -- went out to play basketball, and I told him, hey, we have a free time, can you give my -- give me a math problem and -- to solve?</span> <span id="s1253">And I hoped one day to be a mathematician.</span> <span id="s1254">But when I started -- and applied to college, I said hey, if I’ll be a mathematician, what could it be?</span> <span id="s1255">At that time the only thing what I could be is a teacher, in all, I did not want to be a teacher.</span> <span id="s1256">Because I was earning money in high school by tutoring other people, and I thought, no, I don’t want to do this.</span> <span id="s1257">So close to it, science, I said, hey, chemistry -- chemistry, I -- maybe I’ll be able one day to work in Vitezma Institute.</span> <span id="s1258">So this influenced my decision to choose it.</span> <span id="s1259">Yes, and after that I understood what I did during the war, how I blew up thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">Q: That early experience with explosives, and it doesn’t determine your future.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">A: No, I became really not knowing much of chemistry especially is whenever it was needed -- needed to blow up things and we didn’t have much TNT.</span> <span id="s1262">I devised a method simply by taking -- putting together shells from -- from various -- various types of shells, and in between a small piece of TNT, and blowing up this TNT, and this TNT were causing all the shells to explode, and -- and take down the whole bridge.</span> <span id="s1263">This is -- this was my -- my invention, how -- how to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">Q: You’re in inventor.</span> <span id="s1265">I don’t think I have any other questions, unless there’s anything that you’d like to add.</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">A: No, thank you, it was for me of interest to go, because I -- I wanted always to come, and I was fighting it, to go to see what do people want to see in the Holocaust Museum, and I saw so many people reading the various things, which most of them were known to me, but still it was of interest, the way it was presented.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">Q: Well, I thank you for [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">A: Thank you, and this can be of help to some -- to somebody, I am glad that I told it.</span> <span id="s1269">End of Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">Conclusion of Interview</span></p></body></html>
