It was in Kovakolitch across the river Steir. He got land in one place and in Komarova. My father and mother got a living from that.
Q: You said your parents sent you away to school in Sarna. When did you first go to school there?
A: They sent me to school in Sarna in 1934. And I began in first grade and I finished in Sarna in eighth grade, that’s 1938. I came back from Sarna.
Q: When you went to school there, did you stay the whole year? Or did you go for the week and come back for the weekends?
A: No, only the winter vacations and summer vacations, I came home. And that’s always I stayed because it is not very, very close. It was from our village to Sarna it was 100-110 kilometers and my parents were not rich people to pay to come from Sarna and go back. And it’s not a train, we got a train only just to Shartansy-Shartrisk and then with horses, we went to our village and it takes a long time.
Q: Did your sister also go away to school?

Q: So you started working after you came home?
A: Yes. When I came home from 1938, I was working at home, helped the parents and then when it’s 1939, came the Russians. I begin to work for the Russians. We got all government jobs. We didn’t have own jobs because the fields, they take away everything. I begin to work and my father begin to work. And in a couple of years, begin the other war. That’s 1941.
Q: Can you tell me a little bit about, did the Germans ever come to Komarova, in 1939, did they ever make it that far?
A: Yes In approximately 10 days, you mean in 1939?
Q: Yes, in 1939. Did they ever reach Komarova?
A: No, in 1939 it comes not the Germans. Our place, take Russia in 1939.
Q: So you were in the eastern part of Poland?
A: Yes, and that’s decide after the book. You know, the border -- the Germans stopped on the border on book and the Russians came and take our place and then we begin to live in Russia in 1939. And we live until 1941 until begin the war between Russia and Germany. That was the war between Poland and Germany.
Q: That was in 1939?
A: 1939. And it’s our place, take Russia and it’s become Russia in 1939 and didn’t leave until 1941. Again the war.
Q: In the days after September 1st, 1939, when the Germans invaded Poland, what did your parents do, what were they thinking? Were they frightened of the Germans? Were they apprehensive about what was going on? How did they feel at that time, do you remember? `
A: Do you know, what I remember what my father explained to me, we hear Germany killed a lot of people and people run away from Germany, sometimes the father, the father was talking, he was saying “I can’t believe what can happen”. He was a war prisoner in a time in German and he was saying how the Germans was very good to Jewish people. There were prisoners and they were good. He say he cannot believe Hitler can change the situation. Because, in this time I think Wilhelm was the president of Germany and this become when Hitler came to the power and he changed. I remember when the war with Russia he told me he say I cannot believe he will kill us for what. The people we live in village, we Jewish people we live good with all the people because in the village was not a lot of Jewish people. Maybe 5 families, not more, and we didn’t know the difference between us and the Ukraine people. Everything was together, most Ukraine people. And we didn’t know. The Germans came and making all the bad start.
Q: Did your parents think about trying to get away or move to the east, I guess because your father wasn’t that frightened?
A: Yes, we was talking, in this time, I didn’t have a nice life experience in this time and the father say, ‘no, why we’ll go, where we’ll go, who knows how we need to leave the home, we need to leave everything, where we will live and it was a big mistake, a big mistake when the father said we will go to Russia”. A lot of people they escaped from Germany. I don’t know how it will be when we left; no the father didn’t want to leave. He say we stay in our village. He say the Germans say we will work, we work and we will cooperate, for working. No, it was a big difference. Not only to work. They began to kill us. That begins the trouble. A couple, the Germans begin to come to us in 10 days.
Q: That was in 1941?
A: 1941. In ten days the Germans were in our -- I remember, I see them the Germans how they came like it was, the soldiers, a korot --like a rest place, they came. They drink, eat chocolate. No fighting. We feel this time we would have trouble. My father, he speak very well German and he was talking with one older, the young people was very bad. The older Germans was much, much better. One German, I remember the father explained to me, one German told him, you are Jewish, you’ll have a lot of trouble, he told him. It was late. The Germans are here, you cannot go anywhere and he told us, the father. Yes, a German soldier told him we will have a lot of trouble and in 10 days after they came, we feel what it was begin to done to us. The helpers was the Russian_________ (can’t understand). The people live another nationality in the villages and begins trouble and trouble.
Q: Can I go back just a little bit to when the Russians came in to the town. Can you tell me a little bit about what happened then? I mean, how they came in, did they seize property and businesses and things like that?
A: When Russia came to us, we didn’t got no troubles. They came, they begin to work, they didn’t say nothing,__________, it was everybody was feeling like the Ukraine people and it was not bad. We begin to work for the government. I was beginning to work. I got no more education than other people. The Ukraine people they want to make me the head of the government business. And they want for me to make me, and I was maybe at this time 16, and I was the head of the stores what was around the villages of Komarova which was 12 or 15 villages and I was the head of stores.
Q: You were the Commissar.
A: No, Commissar is political. No, I didn’t know nothing about politics. I know only________. I didn’t know how to begin to work. And one Russian guy, he came always from Polkenu, he was beginning to make Russian government, we lived in Poland and we didn’t know a lot of stuff what was going on. And I remember he begin to teach me. I told him, “People, I don’t know from what to begin?” And he begin to teach me how to work and I begin to work and it was not bad and the head from the Polke, the higher grade office there, how it’s called, and he tells me “oh you work very well and good” and when I came to a meeting, I was the youngest person, most of them were 50 and 40 and I came, 17 years, and he was looking to me what is a child come to us. And I was not this time very tall. I was beginning to work and I was working until begin the war, 1941. And it was a big mistake why the parents didn’t left this place and go to Russia. When I take the money from the stores, they bring all the money to me and I put them in the bank to Menibish. When it begins the war, I got money, I got the government’s money. Then they come to me at nighttime, the Ukrainian people to take the money. When overnight left, it was possible to have money, it was government’s money. We didn’t left, we stayed. Maybe in a couple of days, they come to me at nighttime, the Ukraine people and say give the money and you have gun. I didn’t need a gun, I never got a gun. And they begin to do a lot, a lot of bad things, it’s terrible today if to remind us.
Q: You said you worked for the Russians. Did your parents also work?
A: Yes.
Q: What did your mother and father, what were they doing?
A: The mother was working -- when the Russians came we got a cow, not later we cannot have, but in the beginning we got a cow and she made food and in the house and the father was working. He teach young people, the presignico how it’s called, Russian.
Q: He taught Russian to the Polish children?
A: No, no, not Polish children. They speak no Russian. And the father, he was in the Russian army and he was an officer, I don’t remember, from the Czar’s army, he got crosses.
Q: Like a medal or something?
A: Yes, medals. When the Russians came, no one to teach the records and people see what, we know him and he was a good soldier and he knows Russian language good and he begin to teach the government and he take money for this. That was his living and I was working. We was not rich. Not rich, poor. We didn’t got a life like we live now in America.
. Q: So your mother, she didn’t work outside the house. She worked in the house and that was
A: Yes, in the house.
Q: You started to tell me and I stopped you. Can you tell me a little bit more about the war starting when the Germans came in 1941? You said when they came into the town, can you tell me a little more about that?
A: When they came in the town I told you, the first day after 10 days when they first came, the father told we will go in the forest for a while, maybe the first soldiers will go and then maybe later will be better to be not in the wrong time in the house.
Q: So he wanted to leave for a little bit, let the soldiers leave and then come back?
A: For a little bit. We went to the forest in Komarova village in the forest. We got a horse. Yes, we went to the forest.
Q: The whole family went to the forest?
A: Yes, the whole family. And we came back in a couple days. They take out everything from our home and we came, the home it was empty. Everything. We cannot live in our home and we live in the home of my mother’s sister in the same village and we stay together with my mother’s sister’s family and they begin to use us in village. The worst work. You can think they tell us to do this. We begin, they send us to clean offices, to clean toilets. We don’t got toilets, everything is outside and they keep us to clean. You cannot tell, the worst jobs they give to us.

A: No, we didn’t got because they take everything from the house and it is only what we got on us and that’s it. Some a little food we got, we take this to the ghetto because to the ghetto in Kolke, they give in one hour and must take everything you want in one hour and come to ghetto.
Q: Oh, they gave you an hour to collect things.
A: Yes, to come to ghetto, it was no two blocks in the city and if you late to come in the ghetto, they will kill you after the time they give one hour to come in this place. Everybody was trying to come faster in the ghetto.

A: No, from Komarova we got more. I say it is one hour in city Kolke the time to come to the ghetto. No, when we come to Kolke in ghetto, one room it was maybe ten people in one room. It was very, very -- no children but you cannot live in a situation like that. It was very hard.

A: They stayed together. I remember, only, my mother and my father they were crying all the time. They looked at me and my sister, how we will be. A lot of time they say, we older people, you young people you cannot live more, what can happen at every hour. We went to work, someplace. I work at one place, the father worked at another place. They took us to terrible jobs, terrible jobs. No food. You don’t know if you’ll come back. They take us to job and you don’t know if you’ll come back or not.
Q: Do you remember how big the ghetto was?
A: The ghetto was approx 3-4 blocks around, was the ghetto. That was a lot of people because they put in one room. They didn’t watch bedrooms. They put in each room ten, eight, twelve people in one room, which was a lot of people. I think it was 7,000 Jewish people.
Q: Do you remember what your mother was doing? Did they take her to work also?
A: They take her to work. She was working in a, it was a German farm. They took her to work every day to work in the farm. Different jobs. In the field, to clean, different jobs. Every day was another job, every day. And nobody paid and nobody give food. Hungry. In most situations, the morality was very, very bad. You know now you work and in one hour you don’t know if he will kill you or he will kill somebody in the family. And it was every day, thy killed, killed. Terrible, terrible situation, terrible.
Q: How did your family get food in the ghetto, did the Germans provide any food?
A: Any food. What is left from______________ comes from the villages, people, for a piece of bread we give a suit for a piece of bread. Who got the clothes, sold the clothes for food, we didn’t got. Some people, friendly people brought to us a little food. What we got, we changed. Then the Germans when we was working, they began to give us 100 grams for a person, bread. 100 grams, that’s a quarter pound. Two small slices. They begin to give us the bread. And that’s what we lived. Hungry and no clothes. We were staying in ghetto over wintertime. Wintertime they take us to hard jobs. That’s to woods in forest, in bridges to repair. Any jobs they need, they don’t need. They keep us till we die. We were working. It was very hard that time.
Q: Was the ghetto heavily guarded? Was it walled in?
A: No, it was not wall. They got police always, day and time and they were going around watching and nobody can come in ghetto and nobody can come out in ghetto. People smuggling. People came in and out. Were not allowed. And if they catch somebody, Jewish people they will kill. And if it’s Ukraine, they will make them trouble and if he brought some food in, they will kill him too.
Q: Did you know people who were smuggling things in and out?
A: From the Jewish people?
Q: Or anybody?
A: No, that’s we live together, we know what there smuggling, they went to brought something, they brought some food. Everybody brought for him. If he didn’t brought something, a lot of food, a little, a little, to keep for one day, two days. Ukraine people, remember smuggling from our village bringing some people to us food. For one day a piece of bread or little potatoes or something more. No, good. It was good people and bad people. Some people were happy, uh huh, Jewish people in ghettos will kill you.
Q: How long did you and your family stay in the ghetto?
A: A year, about a year.
Q: Now, the next summer, did they liquidate the ghetto or did they take people away?
A: They make two pogroms. The first pogrom they make it was approximately in August they make the first pogrom, they take us, me and my father and they took maybe 40 people, maybe 50, I don’t remember how much and they called us one night. They took us in evening and put us in warehouse in Lactop. We didn’t know what. We were thinking that they would kill us. We stay all the night in the warehouse. In the morning they open up us and take us (they open us maybe 12:00 daytime) to the ghetto. When we came to the ghetto we see nobody’s in the ghetto, no people. They kill all of the people and they put them in trucks and they take them out from the city. When I and father came to the house where we were living, it was a big building, we came in the apartment in the room. Nobody begin to cry. I can’t express to you the situation. I will never forget, I came in the basement. You don’t know what it is. If you don’t talk about it. If you don’t talk, a person deals with life what comes on every day and if you begin to remind the time, it is ever forgotten, never. There are moments for any person, it’s a hard time. You can when___________. I came home with father, father would begin to cry and I would begin to cry and call mother, mother and nobody answered. Now we understand what they brought us and they told us to take all the stuff what’s in the apartments and in the houses and we begin to do this. A lot of people we saw what was killed in the apartments and outside. And they tell us to take the people they shot, the bodies, we take them in the wagons and somebody takes them to this place where they kill. It was outside. They stay -- the Germans and the police, they say what are we doing, faster, faster, faster. Everything, but we take everything. Don’t leave nothing. Boxes, in the wagons, put them. We do that job and it’s left 50 or 60 persons, I don’t know exactly how many persons, they tell us, now you can live in these buildings. We do not touch you. It’s left old people. They killed some in the family’s children or they killed the parents, the children left or the husband they killed, the wife left. It was not any family that came but was all the family in life. We began to stay in this place again and we were working the same in the German farm. They take us to the farm, they take us to clean up where the horses stay. Clean the toilets. In one time it not was a lot of people but they left from Germany, they left from Poland, they came to Russia and now was a lot of left, a couple people left in this city where it was the ghetto. One night came a guy and tell me “ you know what, when the Germans came he was a good jeweler and he take in the evening the German take all the stuff and maybe something can happen today or tomorrow, after tomorrow. It was why he came to take this.
(END OF SIDE A, TAPE 1) We stay maybe after that’s enough from the first pogrom where they said you will leave and you need to work. We were working and it’s best maybe at three weeks, maybe 20 days, I don’t know exactly know -- a short time. People come was people come back from the forest because in the forest it was very hard because the Ukraine was killing in the places. They come back in the ghetto and come again a couple hundred people. One day, I with the father, we work in the farm and we didn’t go to sleep in the ghetto after that what the guy say what the German take from him all the gold stuff what he need to work around that. We was sleeping in the farm. One night we stayed with the father in the farm and we hear in morning, it is quiet, everything is -- nothing happen in the farm. It was straw, hay, we sleep in this place. I get up and I see the father get up and we come. It was in the barn a loft high in the top and we begin to come out. We seen nobody -- is quiet. We come only to see down somebody. The Germans with the police, they come very quiet. They were knowing what somebody’s inside. When they see us,_____________ that’s in German. We, with the father, we come down from the ladder, come down and see a German one or two, I don’t remember. They begin to beat us. They beat me, beat the father. The father begin to talk to them in German, they didn’t want to talk at all. I see he beat the father and beat me and a couple of minutes it begin to keep a lot of people but they didn’t go. They left but they didn’t go to the ghetto too. Then they take us again brought to the ghetto. We come to the ghetto we see this –p- stay trucks and police, a lot of police and Germans. Germans was in forms was what kind of soldier I don’t know, was in black forms. A color like that, that was the SS. The SS and green colors uniforms. We see what they stay around the ghetto, they took us in the ghetto and we stay in the house. How many people they can put in one room or two rooms in the buildings, they put us. Then maybe by one o’clock or two o’clock daytime, comes the first truck to the door where they can take people. They make like a corridor, they stay the Germans, the police with like ---.
Q: Clubs or truncheons?
A: Like the police carry. Uh-huh. They begin to beat us, they take from the house into the corridor and we had to run to the truck because the truck is open, you need to run. In house, I told you what it was, was there’s a guy what told us he was a couple more. They say we have a gun. We’ll go, the young people, we’ll go form in the truck. Maybe we can save our life. He said I will begin to shoot and everybody will help me or --. I come to my father and tell him, you know let me, we’ll go together. That’s when we were inside the house, maybe we’ll have a chance to run away. He told me, no, son, I don’t want to go. I don’t want to see your death and you will not see mine. I went and a couple people more, we come ourselves to the door. They hit us and we come on the truck. They put us on the truck. If you sit, you straight up your feet straight and on your feet sit another person. I got the chance to sit, it was my back -- in the back truck in the corner. ____________ they put us and we see, I see what they said maybe five policemens inside and a couple Germans in the inside in the truck. They take us outside the city. Outside the city the guy what he said he has the gun, he begin -- he take two shot, he didn’t work the gun and they killed him straight. When they killed him, I was sitting in left side and I jumped from the truck on the floor. I know I hit my face, it was blood and I begin to run, run from the truck. You know what was difference people, it was people what they got a sympathy to the Jewish people. They didn’t want to do for them like that. No, it was a difference people too, was a difference with this one and they begin to say one Zhid_________. That means a Jewish guy, he’s running. The policeman run away, I was jumped to two fences. Now when somebody tells me to jump this fence, tell me you can kill me, I will not jump. This time it was so, was so to life to be like that. Hr begin to shot after me. He shot me two, three times. He didn’t shot me and I come in a barn. It was a pig and I jumped where the pig -- I know what somebody’s running after me. I see what to do. In Poland or in Russia, it was a small barn. Then you can go up, it stays straw or something more_____and I jumped. It’s only when you’re young, when you’re physically fast what you can do then. That’s seconds, seconds because when I jumped in the barn and I come, it was straw. I come in the corner and I put on me, straw. It takes maybe not more, maybe two minutes, three minutes maybe, not more. I hear what it’s open, the barn is open and the policemen, how many it was, I don’t know. The policemen and the German. They said here jumped, a Jewish guy jumped inside. When I hear this, I think that’s it. When I jumped from the truck, my face was all in blood. I hit my nose, I don’t know.

The place was a shop, it was not far away but I heard of the guns was working, shot and shot all the time. Then the children, women, they take them to walk. Walk a circle with soldiers.
