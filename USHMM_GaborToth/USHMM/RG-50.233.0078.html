of Peekskill, New York.</span> <span id="s4">Mr. Lubell could you please tell us a little bit about yourself, your name during the war, your date of birth, your place of birth.</span></p> <p><span id="s5">Yeah, I was born 1911 in Dombrova Gornicza.</span> <span id="s6">This is by the German border in Poland and then in 1916, this was during the first World War my parents moved out to Germany.</span> <span id="s7">Actually it was Poland and my father had there a job as hazan and shochet(mohel).</span></p> <p><span id="s8">In what town?</span></p> <p><span id="s9">The town, first it was a little town Rawicz and later on in Katowice.</span> <span id="s10">We were six children, four brothers and two sisters.</span> <span id="s11">Somehow or other everybody got an education.</span> <span id="s12">It was no problem.</span> <span id="s13">My oldest brother was a dentist.</span> <span id="s14">The second brother was a pharmacist.</span> <span id="s15">I went to business school and my youngest brother also and we, I can't say well off, but better business class.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">How was your home, Jewishly?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Jewish we only learned what we were taught at home by my father because it was a small congregation, there was no Jewish lessons there.</span> <span id="s18">We had maybe history, Jewish history and so on but otherwise we were only taught by our father, all bar mitzvah and everything my father taught the same as he taught other children.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Were you observant at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Not too much.</span> <span id="s21">My father, yes.</span> <span id="s22">My mother was not so religious.</span> <span id="s23">Also naturally it was a kosher home but we were not too religious.</span> <span id="s24">Also my parents knew about it and they didn't force us.</span> <span id="s25">They knew how it is and everybody finished school, high school or business school and everybody had to go out from home on a job.</span> <span id="s26">This went on nice and quiet.</span> <span id="s27">We lived in Poland; this town became Polish again, but we didn't feel any anti-semitism.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">You didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">No, no.</span> <span id="s30">I had friends, gentile, Polish and even after the war I was in touch with him and he did a lot of favors what I needed, some documents from Poland and so on.</span> <span id="s31">Actually one of my brothers, he was a lieutenant in the Polish army, the pharmacist.</span> <span id="s32">He enjoyed it.</span> <span id="s33">Especially in Poland, an officer in the army, a lieutenant and he had the science of the medical corps and everybody was in awe.</span> <span id="s34">He liked to put on his uniform.</span> <span id="s35">Till the war started out...we lived in Katowice when the war started right next to the German border.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">What were you doing at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">At that time I was in business and we were as I said pretty well off and we wanted to protect our parents so we sent my mother and two sisters to Kielce, this is a town maybe from the border maybe 150 miles or so, a week before the war started.</span> <span id="s38">When the war started we had there this apartment in Katowice and the next day already the Germans all over.</span> <span id="s39">They came out from the holes with the swastika.</span> <span id="s40">Of course in this part of Poland you couldn't know who is a Polack and who is a German.</span> <span id="s41">They could be whatever they wanted.</span> <span id="s42">Whatever was more convenient, this they took.</span> <span id="s43">Everybody spoke both languages in this part.</span> <span id="s44">And then we left with a little car, a little VW.</span> <span id="s45">Seven persons pushed into this car and we went with interruptions and we came to this town to Kielce.</span> <span id="s46">This was Friday ninth the first day of the war.</span> <span id="s47">But the next day there came already rumors the Germans are approaching this town.</span> <span id="s48">We were there on the plaza in this town.</span> <span id="s49">It was maybe after midnight.</span> <span id="s50">My friend put on the radio.</span> <span id="s51">It happened so that he had there a German station.</span> <span id="s52">There came already the mob around us that they called a spy because they heard us listening to the German radio.</span> <span id="s53">So the police came and they took away this friend of ours with this car and he became the chauffeur of the police department.</span> <span id="s54">Everybody said the men should go away because nobody could imagine that they will punish or kill the women and children.</span> <span id="s55">I had a little suitcase that I put in all my necessities and my father just grabbed his tallis and tvillin and we went out going east.</span> <span id="s56">Hundreds of thousands of people walked away from the German border and everybody wanted to go as far east as possible.</span> <span id="s57">We were walking and then we found a Jewish peasant who was going in the opposite direction so we told him, (he had a horse and buggy) I said to come with us.</span> <span id="s58">We were taking all the expenses and we will go with this horse and buggy.</span> <span id="s59">And that's the way it was.</span> <span id="s60">We went all the way to the Russian border.</span> <span id="s61">Somehow it was defeating.</span> <span id="s62">We went there through these little towns in Poland and you had the feeling that it's the Jew, he got to help us somehow.</span> <span id="s63">And it was also.</span> <span id="s64">We came to the little towns, the girls came out, they were washing our socks and shirts and we stayed overnight in different Jewish places.</span> <span id="s65">Everybody accepted this as a normal thing.</span> <span id="s66">Then we were in the last town *Rajibiroff[ph109].</span> <span id="s67">This was a prosperous little Jewish town.</span> <span id="s68">We came there in the market place.</span> <span id="s69">This was Rosh Hashonah.</span> <span id="s70">There came out a Rabbi.</span> <span id="s71">We were eight or ten people in this horse and buggy.</span> <span id="s72">So he divided us.</span> <span id="s73">He took my father to his house.</span> <span id="s74">There were some teachers.</span> <span id="s75">He gave him there some other...They were not afraid because they didn't know that the front was moving so fast.</span> <span id="s76">The second day of Rosh Hashonah we wanted to leave so the Rabbi said you are already on the run, never mind you can go.</span> <span id="s77">We will stay here and see what's going to happen.</span> <span id="s78">So we went another maybe 20, 30 miles and we got to the Russian border.</span> <span id="s79">It was a small town, *Lanoftsa[ph122].</span> <span id="s80">This little town was maybe 100% Jewish.</span> <span id="s81">Also the population took care of us...in line for fruit or bread.</span> <span id="s82">And they said not to worry, the Russians would come over here.</span> <span id="s83">We didn't believe it.</span> <span id="s84">Nobody believed that the Russians and the Germans made a pact to divide Poland.</span> <span id="s85">It happened so that the Russian army came to Poland.</span> <span id="s86">No Russian soldier came to this little town there.</span> <span id="s87">They went and circled it and went they further and we stayed there and again the *Byezhenski[ph134] they called us.</span> <span id="s88">It came Yom Kippur and we went to the shool.</span> <span id="s89">The whole town was there.</span> <span id="s90">I come there in the shool, and in the hall outside I see there a man sitting there with a gun so I asked what is this.</span> <span id="s91">He says this is the only militia man we have.</span> <span id="s92">He is Jewish.</span> <span id="s93">He wanted to go to Kol Nidre and the other one is a great land owner here in this section and he had to watch him and not to lose him he took him in the shool also.</span> <span id="s94">Then the Russians came and we went to the bigger city there in eastern Poland, Lvov or Lemberg.</span> <span id="s95">The city was so filled up with population.</span> <span id="s96">It had before the war some 300,000 population and now with the refugees the town had over a million population.</span> <span id="s97">.</span> <span id="s98">.</span> <span id="s99">had to go back to bring some clothing and maybe some valuables and I went back to Germany, to the German part of Poland.</span> <span id="s100">I went there with a Ukrainian shiksa who was in love with me and another Jewish girl and we went back to Poland.</span> <span id="s101">But this is all complicated.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Are there any major things that happened at this time, episodes or incidents that you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">The Russian soldiers, wherever they were, when somebody wanted to come this way, the Russians said go back.</span> <span id="s104">So we were by the border and the Russians stopped us.</span> <span id="s105">This was already on the way back.</span> <span id="s106">So we told him we want to go to the German side but we changed our minds, we want to go back.</span> <span id="s107">He said so go back.</span> <span id="s108">So we crossed the border without being bothered by the Russians.</span> <span id="s109">This is luck.</span> <span id="s110">And then people didn't know what chances to take.</span> <span id="s111">It was only to take a chance.</span> <span id="s112">I survived because I didn't have any illusions.</span> <span id="s113">As soon as we were in the wagon I prepared for myself.</span> <span id="s114">I took a carton of cigarettes, a loaf of bread and a blade, a sawing blade I put in my shoes between the soles.</span> <span id="s115">We knew what's going on but the people didn't want to know it.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">You knew about the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">We knew about the camps maybe not so close about it but we knew.</span> <span id="s118">When I jumped the train I knew that I was taking a chance with maybe two or three weeks of life.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Do you want to tell us about the time when you jumped the train or was that much later?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">No this is later.</span> <span id="s121">I can tell you maybe skip the ghetto, how the ghetto worked and how it was arranged.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">That would be interesting.</span> <span id="s123">What did you do there?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">When they started with the ghetto and they needed people to work for them.</span> <span id="s125">But nobody wanted to go to work.</span> <span id="s126">So they went out, the Germans, and they caught people on the street, wherever they found them and they sent them to the railroad station.</span> <span id="s127">There the job was to widen the railroad tracks because the Russians have a different width of the railroad tracks.</span> <span id="s128">It was very hard work.</span> <span id="s129">There was a man, his name was Horowitz, and he was the head of the congregation.</span> <span id="s130">That was a famous family.</span> <span id="s131">They had a tallis factory in Kolomjya.</span> <span id="s132">He came out and he had a big speech for volunteers to go to the railroad station so the Germans promised him they wouldn't catch nobody on the street.</span> <span id="s133">So I volunteered.</span> <span id="s134">I was a strong young man.</span> <span id="s135">I spoke fluent German.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Where were you when you volunteered for this?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">In the ghetto.</span> <span id="s138">We went only to German schools.</span> <span id="s139">So at home we spoke German and this helped a lot maybe too.</span> <span id="s140">Anyhow we were there and everybody looked to have a bunker in the house where they lived.</span> <span id="s141">So we had the attic, like this was the wall from the attic, so we built up a second wall.</span> <span id="s142">We had a foot, maybe two feet space between the two walls and if somebody came up the stairs and looked left and right and he saw just the wall so he didn't expect that there are double walls.</span> <span id="s143">So the next day I volunteered and the son of a bitches they hit us the same as before.</span> <span id="s144">Also I was a little experienced with it.</span> <span id="s145">But anyhow I went home and I said no more volunteering.</span> <span id="s146">Later on it was the ghetto a little organized and there came a lot of Hungarian Jews, among them my wife and parents too and they had there a soup kitchen and they made me in charge of order in the soup kitchen.</span> <span id="s147">It was not an easy charge.</span> <span id="s148">They gave out maybe some five or six thousand portions and to keep order among a few thousand hungry people is not an easy job.</span> <span id="s149">But anyhow they had nobody else and they made me the head of the kitchen.</span> <span id="s150">There among others my wife came there for soup, too.</span> <span id="s151">I always treated her good.</span> <span id="s152">It was so there were these Hungarian Jews and I didn't come in one day to work and everybody was asking for me because they knew when I was there everybody had to be disciplined and that's all we needed because the soup they got five minutes earlier or later but everybody was hungry.</span> <span id="s153">And it happened so later on when I escaped from this ghetto I was in Hungary and there some Jews were escaping from Kolomjya too and they heard about my name and they asked me if I was there in the soup kitchen.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Do you want to tell us about your escape?</span> <span id="s155">How did you escape?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">In this ghetto there came every few weeks, there came an action they called it.</span> <span id="s157">They took thousands and thousands of people.</span> <span id="s158">First they segregated.</span> <span id="s159">I was there on the plaza and I was the head of the kitchen there with my personnel and I talked to this German and he gave me half the employees and me.</span> <span id="s160">After this went by, they took away this one day quite a few thousand people.</span> <span id="s161">But they always did the same thing.</span> <span id="s162">When the day went by, whoever survived they made believe that this would be already the end of it, that they wouldn't take any more people.</span> <span id="s163">But I didn't trust them.</span> <span id="s164">I forgot to tell you something else, let's skip it.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Do you want to go back and tell me, it's okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">The first action what there was, there were German and Hungarian soldiers.</span> <span id="s167">I had a little store there in the ghetto with sweets, bakery and so on.</span> <span id="s168">I went to work on a Sunday morning.</span> <span id="s169">I go out and I see the street is empty.</span> <span id="s170">I kept going and I see there's a German SS standing and he stopped me and asked me where I'm going so I told him I am going to open up the store.</span> <span id="s171">So he looks at me and he says you see over there on the road there is standing maybe some two three hundred people, Jews and they were surrounded by SS men and German shepherds and he says go there and join these people.</span> <span id="s172">I was wearing a trench coat and here on the left arm I had the Jewish star and I was walking here.</span> <span id="s173">I didn't go on the road, I stayed on the sidewalk.</span> <span id="s174">My coat opened up and covered here the star and as I approached this group they started walking towards me.</span> <span id="s175">I stayed on the sidewalk and I walked by.</span> <span id="s176">There was a group of Polacks standing there and they said in Polish, for heaven's sake you'd better go home because they will grab you too and you will never come back.</span> <span id="s177">I went around there a few blocks and I went back home and this was the first action they took.</span> <span id="s178">I come home and I told it to my father so he says in honor of your grandfather they didn't take you.</span> <span id="s179">Out of this group none came back.</span> <span id="s180">Among others there was the sister or the wife of the *Judenratt[ph303] this Mrs. Horowitz and everybody was asking go and try to get the people out.</span> <span id="s181">He was collaborating as good as he could and he didn't intervene for his wife.</span> <span id="s182">He asked to intervene for the whole group and they didn't want to give it to him.</span> <span id="s183">So this Mr. Horowitz later on when he realized that this was a lost case committed suicide.</span> <span id="s184">This was the Mr. Horowitz in Kolomjya.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Do you know what year this is?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">This was in 1940, 41.</span> <span id="s187">This was the fall of 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Do you want to move on to your escape from this ghetto.</span> <span id="s189">You did go to other places.</span> <span id="s190">Is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">I stayed in this ghetto till the last action was there and the Germans surrounded the whole ghetto.</span> <span id="s192">They came at night between three and four o'clock and they took everybody out of the beds and put them all on this plaza.</span> <span id="s193">My father wasn't there anymore.</span> <span id="s194">He was taken away the action previous.</span> <span id="s195">They kept us there on this plaza the whole day.</span> <span id="s196">Only in the afternoon we went out.</span> <span id="s197">I was there with four other friends and everybody had some kind of instrument hidden on him.</span> <span id="s198">We didn't know where they will take us because they took people sometimes in the village behind this town and they prepared ditches and they took the people there and shot them there in the ditches or they could take us to the railroad station.</span> <span id="s199">So we made up, everybody was voting for me, I was always the guy who got the votes, so I told the group - I said we go to the railroad station, then we have a better chance to jump out of the window or something.</span> <span id="s200">If they take us there to this little village then we will know that we don't have much of a chance.</span> <span id="s201">So we went to the railroad station, eight abreast, and we go on the road, so we knew that we're going to the railroad station.</span> <span id="s202">Here next to me was a woman with a little baby in the arm and as we walk along she takes the baby and pushes it on the Polish woman's arm.</span> <span id="s203">She didn't know the woman, she didn't know her name.</span> <span id="s204">She just took a chance.</span> <span id="s205">She knew that this child has more of a chance maybe to survive.</span> <span id="s206">This is what I say when it comes to discussions about the holocaust and so on about the books that came out in the tens and the hundreds, who can describe the feeling of this woman who gave away her baby.</span> <span id="s207">Who can describe this?</span> <span id="s208">So anyhow we went to the railroad station and we were maybe in the middle of this whole march.</span> <span id="s209">I see that they're starting by the end of the train and they're chasing in there some seventy or a hundred people.</span> <span id="s210">Then they go to the second train and they're hocking and beating everybody and then I saw one of these cattle wagons had their window taken out and repaired.</span> <span id="s211">So I said to my group we stopped and we let the front go further and we went here and went to this wagon here, to this wagon I picked out.</span> <span id="s212">We went in there.</span> <span id="s213">Nobody was hitting us and we were safe in this wagon.</span> <span id="s214">It happened so that I was standing there and I had the feeling that I'm just a neutral observer.</span> <span id="s215">When I heard the people talking I had the feeling that it doesn't concern me and the episode with the water did you put it in here before?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">There was in this wagon some seventy or a hundred people and there was no place to sit down.</span> <span id="s218">Only part of the people could sit down.</span> <span id="s219">Then somebody looks out the window and it was very hot.</span> <span id="s220">The sun was shining on the roof.</span> <span id="s221">It was only October.</span> <span id="s222">Then somebody hollers they're putting in bread and water in the wagons.</span> <span id="s223">So I said to my friends.</span> <span id="s224">You will see nobody will drink the water.</span> <span id="s225">They said what are you crazy.</span> <span id="s226">And I said no, I,m not crazy but I know what's going to happen.</span> <span id="s227">And sure enough after a few minutes they're pushing in two loaves of bread and a pail of water and everybody goes and tries to grab a piece of bread or a sip of water and they turned over the pail.</span> <span id="s228">So I told my friends, you see, this is what I know will happen.</span> <span id="s229">And we were standing so in the corner the whole day and it got dark the train started moving.</span> <span id="s230">I talked to my wife's parents before we before we went into the wagon.</span> <span id="s231">Then I said we have a chance to get out when we will take out the piece of wood there on this window.</span> <span id="s232">This was easy to take out.</span> <span id="s233">Everybody had a screw driver or a hammer or something.</span> <span id="s234">And I said we will jump out.</span> <span id="s235">There I saw a lot of people who jumped.</span> <span id="s236">Everybody who jumped from the train had here a scrape of the face like this because this movement of the train it went forwards and you had to jump backwards because you get the push from the movement.</span> <span id="s237">I was jumping the third.</span> <span id="s238">The first one I said you will be the first one jumping out you'll go in the direction of the train and the second also and the third stays on the place and the rest of them goes back and we will meet here.</span> <span id="s239">But it happened so that I met only one of my friends.</span> <span id="s240">This was a young man by the name of Hammer.</span> <span id="s241">His parents had a paper factory in the village next to this Kolomjya.</span> <span id="s242">This Hammer the Germans made him the manager of this paper factory and every day in the morning he went out with a group of workers from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s243">He went to work and at night he came back.</span> <span id="s244">So he says we will go there to this village and we'll make believe that we came out of the ghetto to work.</span> <span id="s245">We had to stay there the whole day and wait till they went back to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s246">He went to work and he put me there in a shack and he says I will bring you something to eat.</span> <span id="s247">Just stay there.</span> <span id="s248">Sure enough he brought me to eat and at night we went back to the ghetto like from work.</span> <span id="s249">And the other group came back.</span> <span id="s250">And we went to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s251">And here comes a Mr. Haas, he was the head of the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A Jewish head?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s254">He says to me, Henry I want you to be the distributor of the bread.</span> <span id="s255">After each action or whatever it was the Germans wanted to know how many were left and they sent so many portions of bread in.</span> <span id="s256">So I said no I'm not interested anymore in nothing, only one thing I want to get out of here.</span> <span id="s257">This time there was maybe a few hundred maybe less than a thousand people there in the ghetto out of 25,000 or more.</span> <span id="s258">So he says you can make a fortune.</span> <span id="s259">I say I know how to make a fortune by this bread distribution but I'm not interested anymore.</span> <span id="s260">So how is the gold mine there?</span> <span id="s261">You got so and so many pounds of bread.</span> <span id="s262">I don't know, everybody got a pound or so, something like this.</span> <span id="s263">The one who sold the bread had a scale - two pots, on each side a pot and one side were the weights, on the other side the bread.</span> <span id="s264">It took a day to distribute a whole bread.</span> <span id="s265">So here where the bread was were crumbs.</span> <span id="s266">I never cleaned out the crumbs.</span> <span id="s267">The crumbs were staying there the whole day and from every portion of bread the crumbs may be a quarter of an ounce or something and by the end of the day everything was distributed and you had one bread, maybe two breads left over.</span> <span id="s268">But I said not interested anymore.</span> <span id="s269">And there was a Polish, a Ukrainian peasant maybe who delivered to the Germans, they had a place where they collected metal, rags, and so on where they could recycle.</span> <span id="s270">This peasant came one day and says next week Wednesday there came the smuggler to me and he has to have ten people and he will take you over the border.</span> <span id="s271">This smuggler was the same that Elizabeth went with.</span> <span id="s272">I didn't know about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Was he a Hungarian?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">No,, no, this was Poland, Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s275">He comes.</span> <span id="s276">There was a girl living with me in the ghetto, a Hungarian girl, not this one.</span> <span id="s277">They send the smuggler for her, to bring her back to Hungary.</span> <span id="s278">But the smuggler wanted to go only with ten people because otherwise it doesn't pay so I told the guys and they said they won't go, they will hire and go with the truck not with the peasant there.</span> <span id="s279">So I said okay you can do what you want.</span> <span id="s280">What do you think you have such a good credit rating?</span> <span id="s281">The Polak will take you when he gets his money in advance.</span> <span id="s282">This peasant came and I spoke to him and I told him that I will go only with this one girl and for this one girl they had the money in Hungary.</span> <span id="s283">The next day we made arrangements and this peasant came there to this lot where they had these rags and he said he will go through town and by the end of the town there's a river and a bridge and when they cross the bridge he will stop and take us on this buggy.</span> <span id="s284">So we went through town and this girl was very semitic Jewish looking and whenever we went by a store and it was dark and the store was light I told her to wear a hat and I took off my band and somehow I felt like I'm a free bird.</span> <span id="s285">Why should I wear this?</span> <span id="s286">So I took it off and the girl took it off and we went through the whole town till we caught up with this peasant and he stopped and said, get up.</span> <span id="s287">So we went on this buggy and we laid flat on the floor and covered ourselves and he drove off.</span> <span id="s288">It took quite a few hours till we got where the peasant lived and we arrived on his farm and there was a big mountain of dried leaves.</span> <span id="s289">He buried us in these leaves and he said to stay here and he will come back later.</span> <span id="s290">Maybe after a half an hour, an hour, the peasant comes and says let's go.</span> <span id="s291">He took us in the stable.</span> <span id="s292">In the stable was hay upstairs and he says go up there and stay there in the attic.</span> <span id="s293">After a long while he comes with a loaf of bread and a can of milk and we were eating supper, so called.</span> <span id="s294">And the peasant says tomorrow morning he goes back there and what shall he tell the people?</span> <span id="s295">So I told him you want to do me a favor I wrote him down on a piece of paper in German to trust this man, that he is a very decent guy and not to take chances with some trucks or something.</span> <span id="s296">I told the peasant to tell the smuggler that we will have to go by ourselves because they don't know him and they don't trust him to go.</span> <span id="s297">The next day the peasant goes into town and at night he comes back and he opens up the trap door and sticks his head in and says in Hungarian[690], in English - in Kolomjya there's nothing left.</span> <span id="s298">And it happened so that I had such a feeling that pulled me out of this ghetto, out of this town.</span> <span id="s299">The Germans surrounded the whole rest of the ghetto what was there and they lit it up from all sides and hardly somebody could escape from it.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">What year was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">This was 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Where did you go after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">After that this peasant went with us.</span> <span id="s304">We went to the smuggler and I told him to tell the smuggler that when we will be on the other side, on the Hungarian side, he will have to bring a piece of paper, a letter that I gave him and other people will come the next time.</span> <span id="s305">They want to have proof that we are safe in Hungary.</span> <span id="s306">Besides me and this girl was another Jewish woman.</span> <span id="s307">She was hiding somewhere in the woods and the peasants were feeding her and then there come another young boy and he says the next night we will go.</span> <span id="s308">And the smuggler says don't worry.</span> <span id="s309">If there is any danger don't panic I will use the gun.</span> <span id="s310">So we went with the same smuggler and after a few days we're on the Hungarian side.</span> <span id="s311">The smuggler takes the letter there from this girl to her relatives.</span> <span id="s312">The smuggler goes away and that night he comes back and says nobody is there at this address.</span> <span id="s313">The people ran away and he doesn't have nowhere to leave us.</span> <span id="s314">So I said what does this mean?</span> <span id="s315">He says we have to try whatever you can but I would advise you to go to some gendarmes and give yourself up.</span> <span id="s316">This was a sure death because the Hungarians when they caught somebody gave over to the German gestapo.</span> <span id="s317">They were right by the border.</span> <span id="s318">I had some Polish money so the smuggler exchanged some Polish money for Hungarian.</span> <span id="s319">This young boy who was with us said that he's going back with the smuggler.</span> <span id="s320">This boy was living in the village where he lived before the war and he stayed overnight every night somewhere else.</span> <span id="s321">He didn't even tell the peasants that he's there.</span> <span id="s322">Nobody knew, but he slept every night somewhere else.</span> <span id="s323">He went back.</span> <span id="s324">So I was left with these two women.</span> <span id="s325">The peasant came.</span> <span id="s326">He gave me some other few pennies[*Hungarian731] he had, this Hungarian money and he left us there.</span> <span id="s327">This was on a Friday night also.</span> <span id="s328">The peasant went away.</span> <span id="s329">When it got dark, I go out from this bunker.</span> <span id="s330">This was built up from pressed hay for the winter for the cows, and inside was hiding us.</span> <span id="s331">It was hollow.</span> <span id="s332">He goes away and that's all and he says lots of luck.</span> <span id="s333">We started walking towards the village.</span> <span id="s334">It's light in the house and I hear singing Zemiros and I thought now we are safe.</span> <span id="s335">I go to the door and knock on the door and the woman asks in Hungarian who is it.</span> <span id="s336">I answered in Yiddish to open up the door we need help.</span> <span id="s337">So this woman didn't open the door.</span> <span id="s338">But she was hollering so loud [*in Yiddish749].</span> <span id="s339">She didn't open the door.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Could you translate for the tape?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Yes, go away from my door.</span> <span id="s342">You're killing me.</span> <span id="s343">So we left her and we're walking and we come to another house.</span> <span id="s344">There was a light in it but it was not Jewish.</span> <span id="s345">And I said to the woman who was with us, she was a typical aryan face you go there (and she spoke very good the language also) and ask about directions, where the railroad station is and so on.</span> <span id="s346">So the woman goes in.</span> <span id="s347">She knocks on the door.</span> <span id="s348">Somebody opened the door and she walks in and I never saw this woman again.</span> <span id="s349">We were sitting there maybe at least an hour and nobody came out.</span> <span id="s350">I didn't want to take any chances.</span> <span id="s351">We go there to this village and all of a sudden a horse and buggy guy comes by and he stops and says where do you want to go?</span> <span id="s352">So I told him I want to go to the railroad station.</span> <span id="s353">So he says go sit down.</span> <span id="s354">So we went there in this buggy and we went to this village.</span> <span id="s355">All of a sudden there's a little bar there and this guy stops and walks inside the bar and says wait here I'll be right back.</span> <span id="s356">We're waiting and he didn't come out either.</span> <span id="s357">Another guy comes out and he's following us.</span> <span id="s358">We started walking and he's following us.</span> <span id="s359">I said let's go in here.</span> <span id="s360">There's a dark yard there.</span> <span id="s361">We walk in there and he follows us too in there.</span> <span id="s362">I stopped and I said to this girl, talk to him in Hungarian.</span> <span id="s363">I didn't speak the language.</span> <span id="s364">I said do something, try, do something.</span> <span id="s365">I started talking to the guy Polish, whatever I could, Hungarian I didn't know much.</span> <span id="s366">I took off my watch and I had a lighter and I said here take the watch and the lighter, what else can I give you and let us go.</span> <span id="s367">So he took the watch and the lighter and he says okay over there is the railroad station but watch out don't get caught because when you get caught here you are lost.</span> <span id="s368">This was right by the border.</span> <span id="s369">So we go to the railroad station and outside it was dark and inside was only a pale light.</span> <span id="s370">I go inside and I tell the girl not to stand in the light.</span> <span id="s371">There is a line there and people are standing in line for these tickets.</span> <span id="s372">There come two policemen, two gendarmes, tall guys, and they started talking to me and I didn't want to answer, just moved my hand like this, but I understand, he wants to go ahead of me in the line.</span> <span id="s373">So he was ahead of me and I came to this window in plain Polish but in Ukrainian it's the same thing.</span> <span id="s374">I said Two to *Rachov[ph792].</span> <span id="s375">This was the next town.</span> <span id="s376">In *Rachov this girl had a mach tainiste[*ph799].</span></p> <p><span id="s377">"In-law" Yeah, in *Rachov.</span> <span id="s378">So she says we'll go to *Rachov and then we'll see what's going to happen.</span> <span id="s379">So we go into this train and I asked this girl how do you say in Hungarian good-night or good evening?</span> <span id="s380">I learned this and I said you take the tickets and I will sit here and sleep and when the conductor comes to check the tickets you handle it.</span> <span id="s381">Sure enough he comes to take the tickets and *Rachov was the next station.</span> <span id="s382">When we arrive in *Rachov I see a tumult, a lot of soldiers around.</span> <span id="s383">I said this is just perfect.</span> <span id="s384">In Europe when you go out from the railroad station they take your ticket when you walk out and they look at everybody in the face.</span> <span id="s385">In this little town everybody knows each other.</span> <span id="s386">When we got to the gate I said in Hungarian[*815].</span> <span id="s387">This means good evening.</span> <span id="s388">So the guy answers[*816] and salutes.</span> <span id="s389">We went out and we went to this *mach tainiste.</span> <span id="s390">This was again a Friday night.</span> <span id="s391">We get there and the girl knocks on the door and the *mach tainiste comes out and opens the door and she didn't recognize the girl.</span> <span id="s392">First of all she was maybe ten days in the woods and she didn't eat and so on.</span> <span id="s393">So she told her who she is.</span> <span id="s394">She started lamenting you can't stay here, it is dangerous and all kinds of stories.</span> <span id="s395">So I said to the woman, look you don't have to give nothing to me.</span> <span id="s396">I don't need nothing, but this is your relative.</span> <span id="s397">So she says okay.</span> <span id="s398">This was after Succos.</span> <span id="s399">She said my neighbor next door has there a succa.</span> <span id="s400">Go in there and you will stay there overnight.</span> <span id="s401">So I said look I will stay there only if your neighbor knows about it because I don't want him to come out and catch a thief.</span> <span id="s402">So the woman gave us a glass of milk, but cold because it's Shabbos and wouldn't be heated and we stayed overnight.</span> <span id="s403">I said we won't go in the succa, we'll go in your outhouse, not the neighbor's.</span> <span id="s404">We went in this outhouse and the wind blows and the door goes open and closed.</span> <span id="s405">So I took out from my shoe the shoelace and I tied up the door.</span> <span id="s406">In the morning the woman comes out and she gave the girl some money and says go over there.</span> <span id="s407">There's a synagogue and they will help you.</span> <span id="s408">She didn't help anymore.</span> <span id="s409">She spoke Hungarian so I was not good for her.</span> <span id="s410">She goes away and I go in the street and I go to this big building where she shows me the synagogue and I see it's full of soldiers there.</span> <span id="s411">It was taken over by the army and they made their barracks there in the synagogue.</span> <span id="s412">Further down the block I see a Jew coming there with a tallis so I stopped him and asked him where's the shool and he says don't go in here.</span> <span id="s413">There's a barracks here.</span> <span id="s414">And he showed me there is another synagogue.</span> <span id="s415">He went there.</span> <span id="s416">He opened up, there was a padlock on the door.</span> <span id="s417">He says, go inside.</span> <span id="s418">I will put up the padlock from the outside so that nobody will know somebody went in here.</span> <span id="s419">Sure enough he went away.</span> <span id="s420">I sit down and there was a big iron stove there, heated up.</span> <span id="s421">I sat down and fell asleep.</span> <span id="s422">All of a sudden I wake up and I didn't know where I am.</span> <span id="s423">I think I'm dreaming.</span> <span id="s424">I see all the Jews there with the Streimel, fur hats and so on and everybody is singing and dancing and I was sleeping through the whole ceremony.</span> <span id="s425">One of the Jews comes over to me and asks me where are you from.</span> <span id="s426">I told him.</span> <span id="s427">He says you know what, do you see this gentleman there, this Jew, when we are going home, you follow him.</span> <span id="s428">He knows about it, you follow him.</span> <span id="s429">So I follow this Jew to the house and we're coming in.</span> <span id="s430">There are his wife and three daughters but he told me, don't talk to my wife, don't tell her nothing because she will be afraid.</span> <span id="s431">I ate there and then he says to go back to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s432">I went back to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s433">He told me that the padlock would be open like it was in the morning.</span> <span id="s434">I sat down and there came in a congregation, they call it *shalisheedos[ph880] The third meal of the sabbath.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">That's right.</span> <span id="s436">They came there.</span> <span id="s437">They were singing and eating and drinking and they say the next day I will go to Marmarosz-sighet.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Romania.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Yes but this was Hungary.</span> <span id="s440">So he says this young man goes to *Marmalo Sigurt.</span> <span id="s441">You just follow him when you go off the train, don't talk to him nothing.</span> <span id="s442">Here is your ticket.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">We're going to jump ahead a little bit if you don't mind.</span> <span id="s444">I'm interested in knowing about your time with the partisans.</span> <span id="s445">Could you tell me a little bit about how you got involved with it, what you did there?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Yeah, but again it's the same.</span> <span id="s447">It's too long.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Tell me about the major parts.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">The major parts.</span> <span id="s450">In 1944, August the 28th erupted an uprising in Slovakia.</span> <span id="s451">It was organized by Russian paratroopers and the barracks of the Slovakian army.</span> <span id="s452">There's a difference between the Czechoslovakian army and the Slovakian army.</span> <span id="s453">They were in the barracks and the Russians drove in with a truck to the barracks and he said here we give you a choice, do you want to be with us or against us?</span> <span id="s454">So they joined this uprising and we were a group of 20 people.</span> <span id="s455">I said don't rush into something because we didn't know who was the leader.</span> <span id="s456">The communist party took over the Russian partisan movement and the democratic government had a branch in London.</span> <span id="s457">We had there a Polish lieutenant, he was Jew, and he got in touch through the Slovakian army with London and the army wanted us to join the army, and the Russians wanted us to join the partisans.</span> <span id="s458">This whole movement lasted two months.</span> <span id="s459">Then the Germans encircled it and we went in the woods.</span> <span id="s460">I forgot to mention when we were taken from the ghetto to the railroad station I learned something from the Germans right there.</span> <span id="s461">There came a truck of German soldiers to the town where we were and partisans encircled and took them off the truck.</span> <span id="s462">They were standing on the side of the road, about 40 German soldiers.</span> <span id="s463">All of a sudden they dispersed the Germans.</span> <span id="s464">Everybody went in a different direction and you couldn't shoot because you would shoot civilians.</span> <span id="s465">All these Germans escaped.</span> <span id="s466">So I took an example from this and I told them if we go to this village if we run away, everybody has to run away in a different direction.</span> <span id="s467">But it didn't come to it.</span> <span id="s468">So the Germans came in and encircled this whole piece of land.</span> <span id="s469">It went from *Bratislava [ph955] to *Korshitza [ph955].</span> <span id="s470">When the Germans came closer we decided we had to go in the woods.</span> <span id="s471">There was a whole groups of soldiers,2 escapees from the POW camps and there was even an American B29 bomber landed there and he couldn't get out of it because the lawns were wet and he couldn't start.</span> <span id="s472">We went in the woods and all of a sudden (I was very good in orienting myself by the stars or by the trees and so on) and we all thought that we're going east to meet a Russian army but I stopped and I said no we're not going east, we're going north and north are the Germans.</span> <span id="s473">There's the town of *Karzhmarop[ph973] and some other towns and I stopped there one of the Russian officers and one of the Americans and they took out a map and they took a soldier on a horse and they sent him ahead on the first line and told him to come back.</span> <span id="s474">So they came back and they turned around and we went east.</span> <span id="s475">There the Russians were there pretty close so we came there it started snowing already and we came there on top of the mountain *Prashiva[[ph985] is the name of this mountain and the Russians sent home the Slovakian soldiers, they didn't have confidence in them and only they kept the POWs or groups like we that we couldn't go home.</span> <span id="s476">We were there a couple of days on this mountain and then they said they will go east to try to join the Russian army.</span> <span id="s477">I didn't like the idea and I told my friends when everybody is going your way I would like to stay here.</span> <span id="s478">Why?</span> <span id="s479">I said they had the headquarters of the partisans and they had there laying around bags of lentils and in the snow were frozen big beef liver and another piece of meat.</span> <span id="s480">So that's all stories.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">I'd like to know maybe about the story of how you met up with your wife.</span> <span id="s482">Could you tell us that?</span></p> <p><span id="s483">When I went with my wife.</span> <span id="s484">.</span> <span id="s485">Anyhow after this whole episode we went through the front and in the valley they were shooting and we were on top of the mountain and went through the front and came out behind the front lines on the Russian side.</span> <span id="s486">The first soldiers we met there were Romanians and these Romanians were starving.</span> <span id="s487">They didn't have any food.</span> <span id="s488">We had food but we didn't have any cigarettes so we changed with the Romanian soldiers, bread for cigarettes.</span> <span id="s489">After we passed the front line they took us to the barracks and the officers were mostly Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">In the Russian?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">No, in the Czechoslovakian army.</span> <span id="s492">There were Czechoslovaks were sent by the Russians to Siberian and then they came back with the army they organized in Siberia.</span> <span id="s493">They were mostly Jews because they were running away from the Germans, from Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">This is the army in exile.</span> <span id="s495">There were two Czech armies if I'm not mistaken.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Yeah.</span> <span id="s497">There were two Polish armies, too.</span> <span id="s498">One of my brothers was in the west in the Polish army and the other one was with the Russians in the east.</span> <span id="s499">Anyhow we went there and I had no idea if somebody lives or doesn't live and we went to Bucharest.</span> <span id="s500">I heard that in Bucharest the JOINT is active but the war was still on.</span> <span id="s501">We met the Russians and we had to give up our arms and I had left around some bullets and we were there with some Romanian soldiers that were collaborating with the Russians.</span> <span id="s502">The Russians gave them guns but they didn't give them bullets.</span> <span id="s503">So they bought from us the bullets and we went to Bucharest.</span> <span id="s504">I thought I had a lot of money there.</span> <span id="s505">It was quite a few thousand lei.</span> <span id="s506">We came to Bucharest and we went to take baths in the public baths.</span> <span id="s507">The money was just enough for the bath and a glass of soda.</span> <span id="s508">I got in touch with the JOINT.</span> <span id="s509">I knew I have a cousin in Israel, in Tel Aviv.</span> <span id="s510">He went out of Poland before the war.</span> <span id="s511">His name was Saltzman.</span> <span id="s512">So I wrote the address Saltsman, Tel Aviv.</span> <span id="s513">The first name I knew, too, Binim.</span> <span id="s514">We were there in Bucharest two, three weeks.</span> <span id="s515">After three weeks I go and they said there's a note there for me.</span> <span id="s516">So what happened.</span> <span id="s517">They found this Saltzman and they gave him the note and they found out the first time that I'm alive and my one brother was with my cousin there.</span> <span id="s518">My cousin had there a tannery during the war and did business with the English.</span> <span id="s519">Elizabeth had here before this piece of paper from the JOINT.</span> <span id="s520">They write that I'm here and my brothers are here and one brother is there and one brother is in the Polish army and one is in England.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Can we jump a little and see how close to your time of liberation.</span> <span id="s522">Where were you and what was going on and how were you liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Liberated?</span> <span id="s524">I liberated myself.</span> <span id="s525">I crossed the border there.</span> <span id="s526">When I went to Bucharest I was already liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">I wasn't clear if the JOINT was already operating.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">The JOINT operated there because Bucharest was liberated by the Russians before.</span> <span id="s529">But Budapest was liberated only the middle of January 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">You were in Hungary?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">I was in Bucharest and then we went to Budapest and then I was looking for my wife.</span> <span id="s532">I had the address and I walk in.</span> <span id="s533">The building is standing but there was a big hole in the building from the top to the bottom.</span> <span id="s534">The bomb went in but didn't explode.</span> <span id="s535">I went into the staircase and I see somebody is coming down and there she was.</span> <span id="s536">She did not recognize me at first either and then she said are you that Henry?</span> <span id="s537">And I said yes.</span> <span id="s538">It happened so that she had a guy waiting outside for her, a date.</span> <span id="s539">So she didn't even go back to him.</span> <span id="s540">We went upstairs in the apartment.</span> <span id="s541">I have other episodes with the partisans.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Anything that stands out in your mind, a particular adventure?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">We were a group of Jews there with the partisans and they sent us out on missions to put bombs under the tracks and so on.</span> <span id="s544">Among other things there came a Jewish group of four or five men.</span> <span id="s545">They were with the English air force.</span> <span id="s546">They came from Israel but there was no Israel yet.</span> <span id="s547">They were with the Hagana.</span> <span id="s548">They came with the idea to bring out the few thousand Jews hiding in the woods in Slovakia and they came with the idea to make a bridge.</span> <span id="s549">They wanted to take out by plane the group of Jews that were in the woods.</span> <span id="s550">They got in touch or we got in touch with them and they wanted to take out our group, there were some 20 Polish boys and girls and they wanted us to be the first ones coming out.</span> <span id="s551">But then the war started, the uprising collapsed.</span> <span id="s552">There was with us a young man by the name of Chaim *Hermish[ph1165] When we crossed the front the Russians took out us, the Polish group, they didn't know what to do with us so they gave us to the Czechoslovakian army.</span> <span id="s553">There was this Chaim Hermish and another Israeli soldier.</span> <span id="s554">There wasn't an Israel then.</span> <span id="s555">They went to Odessa and from Odessa they sent them back to Palestine.</span> <span id="s556">This was the end of Chaim Hermish.</span> <span id="s557">After the war, in 1950, we went the first time to Israel from Europe.</span> <span id="s558">This Chaim Hermish, he went to Palestine and he went on the radio and he was reading a list of names.</span> <span id="s559">Among others he had my name.</span> <span id="s560">Somebody heard it on the radio, a friend of my brother's and he called him up and he says somebody heard your brother.</span> <span id="s561">So he says what are you crazy and this time he didn't have yet from the JOINT.</span> <span id="s562">And he called up the radio station and asked who this was.</span> <span id="s563">So they gave him the address of this Chaim Hermish.</span> <span id="s564">My brother went and looked him up in a kibbutz and he was sitting with him there the whole night and he was telling him stories about me.</span> <span id="s565">This was how he heard the first time.</span> <span id="s566">I wanted to get in touch
