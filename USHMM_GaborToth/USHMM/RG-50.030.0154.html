I didn't like it and then I went for two years I studied Greek and Latin because I had to.</span> <span id="s22">I wanted to to study law.</span> <span id="s23">At that time in Holland, you had to have the gymnasium, which is high school, plus Greek and Latin.</span> <span id="s24">So I, I did my, uh...for two years I studied Greek and Latin and I got my...uh, I passed my examination and I..</span> <span id="s25">.</span> <span id="s26">in 1940 I started to study law at the University of Amsterdam.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: Did you have brothers, sisters?</span> <span id="s28">A: I had one sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: And her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: Anna Wilhelmina.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: And the name of your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: Pieter Adriaan, like me, and my mother was Anna Maria Megeete.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: In the community in which you lived did you have any aunts, uncles, cousins living nearby?</span> <span id="s34">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s35">Yes.</span> <span id="s36">Some in The Hague, some in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s37">Ya.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: What was the city like in which you lived?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: I don't understand what you mean...where I lived?</span> <span id="s40">Q: What was the community like?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: The community where I lived?</span> <span id="s42">Well, my father was head of the central laboratory, which is an official state institution and he had a rather high, uh, ya...he was a doctor in chemistry and he was head of that institution.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: Was there a Jewish community in the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: Uh, not in Utrecht, but as soon as I was in Amsterdam, of course, I had a lot of Jewish friends and students who were Jews, who studied at the same time.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: The small Jewish community that was in Utrecht...was there any antisemitism in the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: No.</span> <span id="s47">I, I think that as long as I stayed...till my sixteenth, I stayed in Utrecht.</span> <span id="s48">I hardly knew the difference between Jewish and not-Jewish.</span> <span id="s49">It didn't exist at, at that time anyway.</span> <span id="s50">Of course, in, in Amsterdam it's different.</span> <span id="s51">I mean Amsterdam before the war was real...was a rather Jewish town.</span> <span id="s52">I mean there were so many, so many Jews in important jobs and important situations there--ya?</span> <span id="s53">So...but I think that the whole question of antisemitism was just brought up after in the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: What is the fondest memory you have from your childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: That's a difficult question.</span> <span id="s56">I, uh, was...in the holidays and we had a "hoog,"where we...all the families, mostly families with each other, had a wooden house and we loved to, to, to go there on holidays.</span> <span id="s57">There were always forty or fifty kids.</span> <span id="s58">It is, at that age, fantastic, so I had a wonderful youth because of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: What was the typical day like for you when you were growing up?</span> <span id="s60">A: Typical?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: Typical day, an average day?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: No...I can't say...I never had an average day.</span> <span id="s63">Every day was different.</span> <span id="s64">I mean, when you study you, you have so many...no...I, I cannot say that.</span> <span id="s65">I think it...there's no...you can't say there was a usual day.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: Can you tell me about your friends when you were growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: If you mean from, from, from Amsterdam...because I have only two friends left from my Utrecht situation, when I lived in Utrect, and I still have them, but I think that, that my best friends I, uh, had in Amsterdam when I started, uh, started studying and I, I've lived now for fifty years in Amsterdam, so I really I'm really Amsterdam!</span></p> <p><span id="s68">1 Hoog, a home of several levels; a high-rise single-family residence.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: What happened when you were--you weren't yet in Amsterdam, I guess)--before the war started?</span> <span id="s70">What was the climate like?</span> <span id="s71">What was the community like in 1938 and '39?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: Well, I think that the intellectual environment where I lived, the whole, uh, situation with Germany...most of us were quite aware of it.</span> <span id="s73">We were aware of the danger.</span> <span id="s74">We were afraid of what would happen, although no one of course expected what afterwards happened, but I must say that in, in, in my, my people with whom I, uh, talked and, and worked--they were absolutely aware of the bad situation in in Germany, the bad situation of the Jews and of course don't forget that in, in Amsterdam in the years from from '35 on, we had so many refugees, Jewish refugees from Germany and from Poland.</span> <span id="s75">We...in Amsterdam you really were...you...you couldn't, uh, not, not notice it.</span> <span id="s76">It was there.</span> <span id="s77">The, the people lived there in the south, especially in the south of Amsterdam, and some of them stayed there.</span> <span id="s78">Some of them went to, to the States, part of them.</span> <span id="s79">One thing I, I always remember...you know, I'm, I'm, I'm interested in the theater.</span> <span id="s80">And even....as a, as a student I was interested in theater, and just before the war...ya, just before the war, many artists from the cabaret, from the state, from the film, fled to Holland and as I said, some, some went afterwards to the States, but some of them stayed here and I, I've seen all the big names of the...of the actors and the Cabaretiers from Berlin, in Amsterdam, which is...which I would never have seen in my life and it was unbelievable because they were really top people, and I remember that they had the theater where every fortnight they brought a new program.</span> <span id="s81">It was absolutely unbelievable!</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: Were there any plays in particular or musicals?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: No.</span> <span id="s84">I think it, it was just more intimate revues; most of them.</span> <span id="s85">Most of them were in intimate revues in Berlin.</span> <span id="s86">But apart from that, they were well-known actors in German films.</span> <span id="s87">And as you know, German films completely collapsed when Hitler came.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: When you were talking about your circle of friends and the people you had worked with who were aware of the situation in Germany, what type of people were they?</span> <span id="s89">Could you describe their profession?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: The friends with whom I talked?</span> <span id="s91">Well, mostly student friends, of course, and there was a organization, uh, which was called Eenheid Door Democratie, "Unity by Democracy," and that was a, a all the parties or the political parties were, uh, represented there.</span> <span id="s92">Of course, not the fascist ones but all the other, all the democratic parties.</span> <span id="s93">And that was an organization that had a lot of meetings and and tried to to show to everyone the danger of, of, of the fascism, of the National Socialism.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: And so your friends who were students were also members of this party?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: Yes, I think that most of them were were interested in that.</span> <span id="s96">Not all of them, but most of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">And they had many Jewish friends, so they they, they were, of course, interested in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: Uh, is there is a memory of any friend, any one friend or any several friends in particular, in Amsterdam?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s100">Well...I mean in '42--nay, in '41 I was studying with a friend, Jewish friend, uh, and we had lessons for, for law.</span> <span id="s101">You, you did that.</span> <span id="s102">And, uh, we were sitting together in, in a..</span> <span id="s103">.</span> <span id="s104">what do you call it?</span> <span id="s105">...Not a restaurant, but, uh, a meeting place for students.</span> <span id="s106">And then he was called on the telephone and he was asked by his parents to come immediately home.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">They didn't say why.</span> <span id="s108">So he said, "Well, I have to go home," and, and he left and went home.</span> <span id="s109">And, uh, when he came home he was arrested and taken.</span> <span id="s110">And that was the first group of young Jewish boys...it was in '41 before the general, uh, pick-up of all the, all the, all the Jewish people, in '41, and they were all young, young people...young, uh, boys and they sent them to a camp somewhere north of Holland, just...they said a labor camp.</span> <span id="s111">But of course we all knew it was just a a transit camp, and no one has every heard of the whole group.</span> <span id="s112">I'm sure they had been sent to a concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: Let's back up for a minute.</span> <span id="s114">What happened after the invasion, the German invasion in May 1940?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s116">I, I remember one thing...that we were very angry about the Queen--that the Queen left the country.</span> <span id="s117">We...everyone was very, very upset about it, which was not right.</span> <span id="s118">I mean, she was right to, to, to go out of the country.</span> <span id="s119">But at that moment, we felt very much that we were left alone.</span> <span id="s120">And in the beginning of the '40's, the Germans kept a very low profile.</span> <span id="s121">They, they, they didn't do...the first half year they were very, uh, careful not to to to take measures to offend the public.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: Was your life affected by the invasion?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: Well, of course everyone's life was affected...I mean if you're occupied, you're occupied, and I'm no different...I was no different from the other ones in the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: What happened to you after the invasion?</span> <span id="s125">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION - PAUSE</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: What happened to you after the invasion?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: I finished my, uh, my Greek and Latin studies.</span> <span id="s128">And I started studying law at the university.</span> <span id="s129">Q: In Amsterdam?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: Ya, in Amsterdam.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: What were the effects of, uh, the anti-Jewish laws on the people of Amsterdam?</span> <span id="s132">A: Would you repeat that question?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: Do you remember or can you describe any of the effects of the anti-Jewish laws that were passed in Amsterdam when the Germans came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: Ya, but you... mustn't forget that...the passing of the anti-Jewish laws was gradually.</span> <span id="s135">They, they didn't immediately, uh, pass laws, for instance, that the Jews couldn't, uh, go into shops or couldn't go to the cinema or couldn't go by train.</span> <span id="s136">That came gradually during the years, so they they, they, they ...every month they made a new move towards the, the isolation of the Jews and of course that, that...I think that the the...and of course we had the February thing, which you remember, was the strike which was absolutely an illogical strike about, about, about the Jews, and afterwards I think that from '42, from the summer of '42 when the real razzias started, then the feelings really went very high against the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: Did you or your family members or any close friends try to leave Europe at the time?</span> <span id="s138">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: After you finished your studies, then what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: I didn't finish my studies.</span> <span id="s141">Uh, I..</span> <span id="s142">the, the law...law studies in two separate parts.</span> <span id="s143">One is for two years and the other is three years.</span> <span id="s144">First is two years and then you get what we call Kandidaatsexam.</span> <span id="s145">And in '42, I, I did, uh, Kandidaats-exam, so I had finished my first part of of my studies and then I stopped, because at that time the, the, the...in July...June and July of '42, the razzias, uh, uh, razzias were all over the town.</span> <span id="s146">So that moment I, I stopped studying.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: And then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: And then I, I with the Utrecht students, we had, uh, an organization to, to save as many Jewish children as we could.</span> <span id="s149">We specialized only on, on children, not on adults.</span> <span id="s150">That had a reason too, because, uh, we we thought we could better, uh, stay, uh, stay only with the children because if we had...of course you have many, many many times that you have to look for hiding place for adults, but we gave them to other kinds of organizations.</span> <span id="s151">Everyone had his own field.</span> <span id="s152">I think that that's very important.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: A resistance organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: To a sister organization, or a organization who specialized in in hiding adults.</span> <span id="s155">Q: Did your group have a name?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: No.</span> <span id="s157">Because...well, we say the "Utrecht Group" and the "Amsterdam Group"--"Student Group.</span> <span id="s158">"We didn't have...why should we have a name?</span> <span id="s159">Uh, it was not necessary.</span> <span id="s160">And the less you...we all lived under another name.</span> <span id="s161">My name in the oorlogwas Piet van Doorn, and I lived under that name.</span> <span id="s162">I didn't ...I couldn't live under my own name because that was too dangerous.</span> <span id="s163">We all had another name, and we, we didn't want to have too much contact with other groups because the more contacts you had, the more vulnerable you were.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: Can you tell me about your work when you first began in the group?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: Well, we, we, we really began to...because the the Utrecht students...they were before us.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">They, they, they, they were, uh, trying to get, uh, children from the Crecheand as they were living in, in Utrecht, it was fast.</span> <span id="s167">They always had to travel from Utrecht to Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s168">It's not so far, but anyway...they weren't living here, so they contacted us and they said, if, if, uh, we should collaborate..."You, you look for the children in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s169">You know the families," and because we didn't only have children from the Creche.</span> <span id="s170">We had children right from the, from the parents too of course and that goes mouth by mouth.</span> <span id="s171">I mean someone knew that we were taking care of children and, uh, they informed the parents and we got...contacted.</span> <span id="s172">It was not only the Creche.</span> <span id="s173">But they asked us and that's why, why we we started.</span> <span id="s174">They couldn't handle it.</span> <span id="s175">It was too much, and they asked us to, to uh, fetch the children from the Creche and fetch other children.</span> <span id="s176">So, sometimes we hided the children ourselves or we gave them to Utrecht organization--independent who, who had places, but in...let's say a year later we were completely independent and they had their own organization.</span> <span id="s177">We worked together but we, we looked for hiding place ourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: So you were immediately thrown into this work when you joined the group?</span> <span id="s179">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: You said that the group separated.</span> <span id="s181">About how many people did you work with?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: Uh, there were only two men, my partner and I, and all the others one were girls, and that was logical because, uh, we couldn't travel with children at our age.</span> <span id="s183">We were about twenty.</span> <span id="s184">And at that age, it was very suspicious to sit in a train with a child.</span> <span id="s185">I mean...of course as a Jew it was very dangerous, but in that, that period, all men about twenty years of age were very afraid to go by train because the, the Groen Politie,the German police, trapped all the 2 Pieter Meerburg's group was known as the Amsterdam Students Group.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">3 War.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">4 The day-care center, the place in Amsterdam where infants and children were brought and cared for while awaiting deportation.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">5 Green Police, so named because of the color of their uniforms.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">time all kinds of young boys from my age and took them, and sent them to Germany for work, so it was already dangerous just to sit into a train.</span> <span id="s190">So that was one of the reasons why we had...the girls, they were never picked up.</span> <span id="s191">I mean they, they left the girls alone.</span> <span id="s192">So all the, all the transport of the children had to be done by, by the girls.</span> <span id="s193">Sometimes I went with them to get them, but that's, that's different.</span> <span id="s194">Then they were there and it was their child and what we...my partner and I did...we were looking...we went to Friesland, to the north, and looking for contacts, and to look for hiding places.</span> <span id="s195">We went to the south.</span> <span id="s196">We were organizers, you see, but the actual transport was done by the, by the girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: Were these all Christians, or was it a mix of Jews and Christians working together?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: There were no Jews.</span> <span id="s199">There's only one Jewish, uh, couple with whom I worked and they were looking...it was...it was really...the the the woman is still alive, and and they really were looking so Jewish and they worked all the time.</span> <span id="s200">They, they...I never understood.</span> <span id="s201">They, they walked around the street.</span> <span id="s202">They were many times picked up.</span> <span id="s203">They had very good papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">And that was the only Jewish couple which I knew which was, uh, working.</span> <span id="s205">Uh, that's of course the people from the Creche, from the Joodse Raad,and from the Schouwburg, That I don't mean...I mean in our group, there couldn't be any Jews because it was too dangerous.</span> <span id="s206">It would be too dangerous.</span> <span id="s207">.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: You were able to travel freely by yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: I was able to be, uh, to, to travel by myself because I had wonderful papers.</span> <span id="s210">I was an inspector of the, of the train, of the--of the signal system of the train.</span> <span id="s211">This was, of course, completely falsified, but it, it gave me the opportunity to sit into the train, because if the Groen Politie--they thought I was working for the railways.</span> <span id="s212">They thought anyway, so I, I..</span> <span id="s213">.</span> <span id="s214">they didn't bother me.</span> <span id="s215">It was...they were very good papers.</span> <span id="s216">They were completely false, but they were good.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: Was it difficult for other members of your group to travel back and forth?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: No, for the girls it was not.</span> <span id="s219">No.</span> <span id="s220">It was no problem.</span> <span id="s221">And my partner had the same kind of, uh, papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: Did you work with the Joodse Raad as well?</span> <span id="s223">A: With the...?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">6 Jewish Council.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">7 The Hollandse Schouwburg, the Dutch State Theatre, which was converted into a detention center for the Jews of Holland, where they were forced to report and held prior to deportation.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: Joodse Raad?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: To a certain extent.</span> <span id="s228">In my opinion the Jewish Council consists of, of, of the two managing directors, Asscher and Cohen,and a whole staff of people.</span> <span id="s229">Most of them were relatives or friends of these people.</span> <span id="s230">The Jewish Council had the responsibility for the Hollandse Schouwburg--the theater where the Jews were brought to be sent to the camp of Westerbork.</span> <span id="s231">They were assembled there.</span> <span id="s232">Now, in in the Jewish Council, in my opinion, there were two kinds of people.</span> <span id="s233">One people were just obeying all the orders of the Germans, trying to save their own lives as much possible, and another part which realized that being a member of the Jewish Council, they had to sabotage as much as possible and to, to use the the, the power they had, given them by the Germans, to, to free as many children and adults as they could.</span> <span id="s234">Well, it was with these people I worked.</span> <span id="s235">Not with Asscher and Cohen.</span> <span id="s236">And for instance, you know, Walter Süßkind,Felix Halverstad...they were Jews who worked for the Auswanderungor Ausstellung.</span> <span id="s237">That was a a part of the Jewish Council supervised by the Germans, by aus der Fünten,and, uh, they were the right people.</span> <span id="s238">They were very brave, and they looked after...they sent their children to the Creche, and they took care that we...they asked us to take the children from the Creche.</span> <span id="s239">But at the same time they let a lot of adults free by, by falsifying papers and letting them suddenly out of the theatre.</span> <span id="s240">They, they they did marvelous work.</span> <span id="s241">They were absolutely fabulous, because in, in that position to do that, is is risking your neck every second.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: So you had no major contacts then with Asscher and Cohen with your work?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: No.</span> <span id="s244">I had no contacts with Asscher and Cohen.</span> <span id="s245">I was once threatened by Cohen.</span> <span id="s246">I had, uh, I'm very unhappy about that.</span> <span id="s247">He he threatened me that if I wouldn't bring back a child which I hid, he would announce...denounce me, and I brought the child back.</span> <span id="s248">I had to.</span> <span id="s249">That was my only contact with Cohen.</span> <span id="s250">And I never had any contact anymore.</span> <span id="s251">I never wanted to have any contact with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">8 Abraham Asscher and Professor David Cohen, the two leaders of the Dutch Jewish Council located in Amsterdam.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">9 One of the Jewish Council's administrative staff who helped save some Jewish lives, particularly children, by removing papers from German files documenting the Jewish population.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">10 A Jewish Council worker, who, together with Walter Süßkind, helped Jews escape from the Schouwburg and the Creche.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">11 Die Zentralstelle für jüdische Auswanderung--the Central Bureau for Jewish Emigration.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">12 Ferdinand aus der Fünten, the commander of the German Security Police, who oversaw most of the Jewish Council's activities.</span> <span id="s257">Aus der Fünten was responsible for all deportations from the Netherlands.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: Why did he threaten to do that?</span> <span id="s259">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s260">He was a dictator.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: Was there something about that one child?</span> <span id="s262">Did it belong to...?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: He, he, he didn't agree that...it, it was a child which we...which the Council itself had asked us...a member of the Council...to hide.</span> <span id="s264">And it...I think it's...there was an internal fight.</span> <span id="s265">The woman who had asked us...was not...he didn't agree that she she asked us that, so when the child...when I hid the child, he was so furious and he said to the woman, "You tell Piet van Doorn if he doesn't bring back the child, I, I, I'll denounce him."</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: And then what would happen if you were denounced?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: Well, that would mean all my, my, my people...it was not so much for myself, but the danger of being caught was always that you would be tortured and you would talk and would give away everything you know, so the whole organization was, was in danger at that time--if one of us would have been caught.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: If he denounced you, in other words, would you have been turned over to the Germans?</span> <span id="s269">A: To the Germans, yes.</span> <span id="s270">That was his intention.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: I know that your work was very dangerous.</span> <span id="s272">Were there any moments in particular that were more dangerous than others?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: No.</span> <span id="s274">I, I, I think that if you live with danger for three years, you don't realize it anymore.</span> <span id="s275">I mean you know it in the back of your head, but you, you, you can't live with that when when you...every every...when you realize every minute that you're in danger.</span> <span id="s276">Of course, I, I, I had one or two very narrow escapes, but we all had.</span> <span id="s277">It's eighty percent luck that you come through.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: Can you tell me about the narrow escapes?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: Well, the narrowest escape I had was, uh, we had a contact in the head of the, the underground in Friesland.</span> <span id="s280">He was the big boss in Friesland, and I..</span> <span id="s281">.</span> <span id="s282">he was...he was a very good friend of mine.</span> <span id="s283">My, my son is still called, is named after him, and he, uh...suddenly there was a very, uh, uh, someone was caught and he was, he was talking, and he knew too much.</span> <span id="s284">So the whole group in Friesland had to, to hide and had to change addresses and go out of Friesland because at first in fact, he knew everything, the man, and he, he betrayed the whole thing, so, so he went to, to Amersfoort, which is near Utrecht, and he let me know that he was there and he asked me to come.</span> <span id="s285">And I had an appointment with him in Amersfoort, on the street not in a house.</span> <span id="s286">And he said, "Well, would you, I, I need a new persoonbewijs, identity card."</span> <span id="s287">And he gave me his photo and he said, "Uh, please take care of it, and give me a very good one."</span> <span id="s288">And of course we had our contacts in Amsterdam, people who were printing...who had original identity cards, but only for the top people in the Resistance.</span> <span id="s289">So I went there and I, I made his, uh...I got his new identity card, and I had, uh, a rendezvous with him at six o'clock on a certain day in, uh, in Amersfoort.</span> <span id="s290">Only, only on a address, but I was very, uh, upset about it because it was so...he was...he was the most man the Germans looked for in the whole country.</span> <span id="s291">So I had to be very careful.</span> <span id="s292">And I asked the girls whom I lived with at the time, "Go with me and and take the identity card, because if I'm caught with that"...I could have been caught just as, as a twenty-year old boy.</span> <span id="s293">That had nothing to do with my...and then I would have...then there would have been the possibility that the identity card would be lost and I would be sent to a concentration camp or something, but that was not the question.</span> <span id="s294">The question was I wanted him to have that identity card and I, I had the feeling that it was very dangerous, so I said to her, "Take...you go with me and let's go together, and you, you carry the, the identity card."</span> <span id="s295">And just before the station, she broke the shoe...the, the, the lace of her shoe, and I was mad.</span> <span id="s296">And we missed the train because of that.</span> <span id="s297">Now what happened actually in Amersfoort was that at one o'clock the whole house was, uh, complete...completely circled...uh, how do you call it?</span> <span id="s298">... circled...by, by very, uh, well-armed German troops because he was so...that important, and, uh, they, they, they, uh, they rang the bell and they said he got...and the man who, who, who did it said, "I have a message from Esme," which is one of the... which was a good way to, to, to go into the house.</span> <span id="s299">Because he didn't suspect anything at that moment.</span> <span id="s300">At that moment he, he came in and, uh, two minutes later he knew he was trapped.</span> <span id="s301">So he took...he tried to take his revolver and, uh....</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: What happened when he approached the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: When he approached the house he was let in and after two minutes, uh, Krijn, which was his name--Krijn van den Helm, realized that he was trapped and he tried to, to, to...he had this revolver in back the of his trousers and he, and he reached for it and he got it on the wrong...the wrong side and the man who was sitting in front of him shot him [NB: Krijn] dead immediately.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: In other words, who shot who?</span> <span id="s305">Just to clarify the situation with the two people involved?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Who was shot and who had the revolver?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s308">But the the the strange thing is that normally when, when things like that happened, the Germans stayed at the house for twenty-four hours at least, to see what, what people came and they were caught there.</span> <span id="s309">That, that happened all the time.</span> <span id="s310">That was the biggest risk you had, that you walked to an address where the Germans had arrested someone, where they were still staying to look who was, who was coming.</span> <span id="s311">Now the funny...you know, the funny...the strange thing is, that they left at six o'clock and I arrived at, let's say, seven because of the fact that I had missed my train, and then when I, when I, uh, rang the doorbell, she said, "Get out!"</span> <span id="s312">so I knew the whole thing was wrong.</span> <span id="s313">Well, that, that was just a lucky escape and, and you know, you never know how, why...if it hadn't been the lace of the shoe, I wouldn't have survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: You mentioned there was another narrow escape.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: The other narrow escape was with my partner who was, uh, caught at the station with all kinds of identity cards and, uh, and, uh, material which was absolutely very dangerous, but he was just caught as I tell you as a, as man, a boy of thirty years, twenty years, to be sent to to Germany for work.</span> <span id="s316">But we didn't know if they had discovered all, all the material, so then the same man from from Friesland, Krijn van den Helm, where I was just talking about...that was before he was killed...I called him and said, What are we going to do?</span> <span id="s317">He's in...my partner Wouter's in jail and I'm afraid.</span> <span id="s318">I don't know what he had, what he had with him."</span> <span id="s319">And he [NB: Krijn] came immediately to Amsterdam, and he went to the university.</span> <span id="s320">And by time in '43 the Germans had a very strange law.</span> <span id="s321">All the students had to, uh, sign a loyal, uh, statement that they would be loyal to the German occu...occupation and German people or something like that, which was completely idiotic, because it was, it was a forced statement.</span> <span id="s322">But they they were very tough on that because they said, "If you don't sign it, either you can't study on, and your parents, especially your father, is responsible," and a lot of students signed because they didn't want their father to be responsible for, uh, what, what, what they did.</span> <span id="s323">It didn't occur to us because we were not studying anymore in '43, so there were, uh, there were student cards of of people who had signed and I went with the...with Krijn van Helm to the university, and he went to the office where they they gave away this...where they had the, uh, this, this...what do you call it?</span> <span id="s324">...college identification card, and he threatened him that he would kill him if he didn't give him a book of these, uh, identity cards, and he gave them.</span> <span id="s325">He immediately gave them.</span> <span id="s326">So what we did, we, uh, put a photo of my partner on it.</span> <span id="s327">It was signed in his name, and his sister went to the jail and he was immediately freed.</span> <span id="s328">So that was a narrow escape, not for me personally but anyway for the whole group.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: But in '43, the situation for Jews...there were no Jews at the university then, were there?</span> <span id="s330">A: No, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s331">No Jews at the university.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: Why did you decide to get involved with the movement to begin with?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: You don't decide that.</span> <span id="s334">It happens.</span> <span id="s335">It happens.</span> <span id="s336">I think for me, uh, sheer honesty,...it was when, when my friend was, uh, called home and disappeared forever, and then you say, "What are you doing here?</span> <span id="s337">You are studying law.</span> <span id="s338">This is ridiculous.</span> <span id="s339">There are so many other things which are much more important."</span> <span id="s340">I think that was the turning point for me.</span> <span id="s341">And then, then it goes on.</span> <span id="s342">Don't forget, we saw razzias in, in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s343">It's a terrible sight.</span> <span id="s344">I mean it's unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: Can you describe one?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s347">It, it's...a whole block of houses is, is, is cut off by, by, by police and and army and they are going from every house, looking for everyone.</span> <span id="s348">Everyone has to, to...had, had a persoonbewijs, and all Jews had a persoonbewijs with a J on it, so if you had not a persoonbewijs without a J, or if you had no persoonbewijs, you are taken, uh, with them, but they, they went from one house to the other.</span> <span id="s349">They didn't have the, the, the addresses of the Jewish people themselves.</span> <span id="s350">No, they...that was the typical way they operated.</span> <span id="s351">They took a whole block and looked for the Jews...in it.</span> <span id="s352">And, and then they brought them out, with children and everything.</span> <span id="s353">It was a terrible thing to see.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: Do you know why there was no list?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: There was a list.</span> <span id="s356">They, they they operated different.</span> <span id="s357">Sometimes.</span> <span id="s358">.</span> <span id="s359">but a real razzia, in my opinion, is a, uh, search of all the houses, and not on a certain address.</span> <span id="s360">Of course, they they, they, they, uh, took, uh, Jews from addresses, but that was individually.</span> <span id="s361">They went to a house with three or four people, and they... and they rang the door, and they saw they were at home and then they took them.</span> <span id="s362">But that's not the same as a razzia.</span> <span id="s363">A razzia is...they wanted to, to, to...because there were a lot of people already hiding in, in, in, in the houses, so they, they found that too, of course.</span> <span id="s364">If you had no identification, no persoonbewijs, they took you.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: When you would watch a razzia occurring, what would happen to the people that they would bring out of the homes?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: They, they, they, they were brought together and, and they went with them in, in army cars to the station.</span> <span id="s367">And mostly they were taken immediately from the station to Westerbork.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: Did you see... were there torturings during the razzias?</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: No.</span> <span id="s370">I, I don't think they were tortured at that moment.</span> <span id="s371">And unfortunately it's not only the Germans.</span> <span id="s372">The Dutch people, the Dutch police helped too.</span> <span id="s373">It's unbelievable--but they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: The Dutch police helped who...??</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: The Germans.</span> <span id="s376">They, they did it together with the Germans, part of the police--not all.</span> <span id="s377">There are, of course, people who refused to do that.</span> <span id="s378">But part of them--they did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: So you worked in your capacity then with the underground from 1942...?</span> <span id="s380">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s381">'Til the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: Until when?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: 'Til May '45.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: And did the situation change at all as far as the...?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: The situation changed because in September of '44, the south was liberated and the north where I lived, was not liberated.</span> <span id="s386">And then we had the toughest time for the population, because then we got what we called the "hongeren.</span> <span id="s387">"There was no food, no transport.</span> <span id="s388">We couldn't reach the children anymore because they were in the south, and they were liberated.</span> <span id="s389">In the north they were still there, but there were no trains.</span> <span id="s390">The trains...all the trains...uh, people who worked on trains...striked, so you were completely insulated in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s391">You couldn't move out of Amsterdam.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: And that year was 19....</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: From September '44 'til May '45.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: Is there one or two, or even several incidents that stick out in your mind the most, about one of the children, or of your experiences helping the children?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: There was one experience which I'll never forget in my life.</span> <span id="s396">That I, I went to, to Joure which is a small town in Friesland.</span> <span id="s397">It was in the beginning.</span> <span id="s398">It was...and there was a man with a laundry, and I heard that the man had a lot of addresses for adults, but for children too.</span> <span id="s399">And he went...every Saturday he went to, to Amsterdam with a, with a truck and he came back in Joure with, let's say, twenty or thirty adults.</span> <span id="s400">And he hided them in different places, so I knew, and I wanted to talk to him, that he would give us addresses for children too.</span> <span id="s401">So I went with with one of the girls to, to Joure and we had two children with us which we wanted to hide, and he had agreed to, to, to, to help us, and okay...we arrived and we gave the children to him and he looked after them, but as it was already late, we couldn't go back to, to Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s402">It was...after twelve you're not allowed to, to be on the streets, so we couldn't make it with the train.</span> <span id="s403">So we had to stay there, so we got...we stayed there and we got a very decent meal.</span> <span id="s404">For us it was very important to get "heel" [NB: Dutch word for "very"] good food, and he was very nice.</span> <span id="s405">After...after... dinner, I sat with him and we talked and then he suddenly said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s406">He told me that he hated the Jews on religious ground.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">They had killed Christians and by his faith, the Jews were his enemies.</span> <span id="s408">But, it is stated in the Bible, "You have to love your enemies."</span> <span id="s409">So that's why he did everything to save them.</span> <span id="s410">Now if I am telling it just now...it looks like a wierd story but at that moment it was a terrible story because I didn't know.</span> <span id="s411">I wondered what he was doing...if he was betraying...a traitor and sending all the the adults to the Germans and the children too.</span> <span id="s412">I was absolutely frightened.</span> <span id="s413">I didn't sleep the whole night and neither did the girl.</span> <span id="s414">And we got out as soon as possible, and we went to, to, to the head of the resistance in Friesland, to Leeuwarden.</span> <span id="s415">And we said, My God, what do you know?</span> <span id="s416">Do you know that man?</span> <span id="s417">Is he all right?"</span> <span id="s418">We informed him.</span> <span id="s419">And it turned out finally he was all right, and after the war I, I spoke to him.</span> <span id="s420">I said, "Do you 13 Famine or "hongersnood."</span> <span id="s421">remember what you said to me?</span> <span id="s422">You have scared the hell out of me because of, of what?"</span> <span id="s423">And he meant it.</span> <span id="s424">He meant it, absolutely!</span> <span id="s425">He said, "Yes, but I, I...." Afterwards, he said, "I changed completely.</span> <span id="s426">I watched these Jews, the whole, uh, during the whole war and they are just like us, and I completely...it was a completely wrong belief."</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: Did the women travel with you on the same train?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s429">If we were...sometimes I was going alone or if I..</span> <span id="s430">.</span> <span id="s431">if we were with children, then the girl...the girl and I always together.</span> <span id="s432">There was no problem about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: Did you also help secure false documentation for the children?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s435">Well...no.</span> <span id="s436">No, nay.</span> <span id="s437">That's not right, I think.</span> <span id="s438">The children didn't get any identification because the children were hidden.</span> <span id="s439">They don't...didn't need, uh, identification.</span> <span id="s440">Some of them, however, got them.</span> <span id="s441">I remember a case of a baby which was just born and one of my girls went to, to, to the registration office and told the officer that she had had a child and, uh, so the child was actually saved.</span> <span id="s442">He had an official non-Jewish mother and the name of the mother, so we didn't have to hide the child.</span> <span id="s443">We, we sent it to, to a family where she was brought up and she survived.</span> <span id="s444">So that happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: Then what happened to the child?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: That's a very strange story because the girl who had adopted her or, or recognized it as, it as her as her son was one...was visiting the, the parents every...every month to give all kinds of things: coupons, uh, bread coupons, meat coupons....</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: This was the child's natural mother visited the foster parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s449">Yeah.</span> <span id="s450">The, the foster parents.</span> <span id="s451">And one day when she was there, the, the Gestapo, they came in, and there was another Jewish, uh, boy living there with the parents and, uh, well, uh, the, the Jewish boy was taken and the parents were taken and she said, "It's my child."</span> <span id="s452">She would prove it was her child, so they didn't take the child.</span> <span id="s453">And the, the, the, the Gestapo said, "How can...how can you put your child with such a terrible, bad family who hides Jews and things like this?"</span> <span id="s454">She says, "I didn't know."</span> <span id="s455">So she took the, the boy with her, and the boy survived.</span> <span id="s456">Funny thing is that after the war, it took her two years to get rid of the child.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">The, the, the legal, uh, the courts didn't believe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: Would you visit the children at all once they were placed?</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: The girls did, but once in a while--not every month.</span> <span id="s460">That would be too much.</span> <span id="s461">And for instance, we had a center in, in in Limburg, in the South, in Tienray where we had 120 children and where there was a Jewish student and some others who stayed there and took care of all the children, so there you didn't have to, to go.</span> <span id="s462">We just brought the the children</span></p> <p><span id="s463">there.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: And what kind of families were the children placed with?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: Never in wealthy families.</span> <span id="s466">Always poor families.</span> <span id="s467">That's the strange thing.</span> <span id="s468">Very...down to earth people, very nice people, very good people.</span> <span id="s469">Sometimes religious people.</span> <span id="s470">But... never in, in a family where there was money.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: How did you find these people?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: Ya.</span> <span id="s473">Well, through the...through the ministers, through the pastors, through all kind of contacts.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: And the ministers and the pastors in the south in Limburg and in Friesland....</span> <span id="s475">Were they willing to cooperate?</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s477">Both the Catholics and the Reformed Church helped enormously.</span> <span id="s478">Q: Together?</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: In one case together, but that didn't last long.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: The children placed in the south...were they placed predominantly in Catholic homes, Protestant homes, religious homes, non-religious homes?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: Uh, yeah...that's a question that you can only ask after the war.</span> <span id="s482">In the war you never asked what they were.</span> <span id="s483">If you had a hiding place, you had a hiding place.</span> <span id="s484">You didn't ask what they were.</span> <span id="s485">We didn't care.</span> <span id="s486">We didn't care where...we were too happy to have an address.</span> <span id="s487">If they were Hindostaans...it didn't matter.</span> <span id="s488">The only thing which we took care of especially, because our south connection...we had to deal with the Bishop of Utrecht, that the children were not to be, uh, bap...baptized.</span> <span id="s489">Yeah?</span> <span id="s490">Is that right?</span> <span id="s491">Baptized.</span> <span id="s492">Of course, the children had to go to church with the other children.</span> <span id="s493">Otherwise it would be too suspicious, and the children loved the Catholic church.</span> <span id="s494">It's, it's really a great show, you know (laughter).</span> <span id="s495">So there was always the danger that they, they, they wanted to be baptized and and some of the the, the pastors would have loved to do that, but from, from the Bishop there was absolutely a, a, uh...it was forbidden to, to do that and in, in, in Tienray where we had these...all these children, there was not one baptism.</span> <span id="s496">There have been cases, of course, that pastors disobeyed the orders of the Bishop and there there will be some baptized, but it was absolutely minimum.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: Why did you decide first to work with helping to save the children rather than adults?</span></p> <p><span id="s498">14 Hindus.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: No...it didn't happen that way.</span> <span id="s500">We were approached by the Utrecht people about the children.</span> <span id="s501">So we have from the beginning in, in, in... we were working with the children and we knew that we, we couldn't do both.</span> <span id="s502">That would be absolutely impossible and we realized that if we had...there were...there were so many children.</span> <span id="s503">If, if, if I give you an example...I think that all the groups together...three or four groups, had 1200 children, which is peanuts compared to how many children there were.</span> <span id="s504">We couldn't do more.</span> <span id="s505">I mean it was...it was such a short time and you...so you have to concentrate on, on, on, on the children.</span> <span id="s506">If, if we didn't do it, we could...you would have done the work for children half and the work for adults half, so we decide very soon with the Utrecht group to...that we'd in principle only take care of children and let the adults be, uh, uh, hided by, by other other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: Was it harder working with the Utrecht group, since the NSBwas headquartered there?</span> <span id="s508">A: No.</span> <span id="s509">That didn't matter.</span> <span id="s510">I lived in front of the headquarters of the SD Gestapo in Amsterdam.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">It was wonderful.</span> <span id="s512">It was even more better because (laughter)...yeah...just...when I looked out of my window I could see the, the, the where the jail, now, the Gerrit van de Veenstraat, then, the Erteupestraat, and it was the most safest place I could could be, so that doesn't matter.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: Were you ever suspected?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s515">I..</span> <span id="s516">.</span> <span id="s517">after the war, records of the Germans--and there has been exhibition about it--gave a complete diagram of all the groups, with our names on it.</span> <span id="s518">So they knew.</span> <span id="s519">They absolutely knew...they only didn't know where we were living.</span> <span id="s520">That, that was the good thing, but I think that the, the Germans were very well informed about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: Were you or your girls ever personally suspected by them?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: Yeah, but they knew, uh, uh, Piet van Doorn, but they didn't know that, that it was me.</span> <span id="s523">I think it worked that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: What was the way in which, in other words, the procedure for you to get the children from the Schouwburg and then give them to the women?</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: I don't understand what you mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: How did you....</span> <span id="s527">In other words, how were the children taken from the Schouwburg then to the homes?</span> <span id="s528">I know they were taken...</span></p> <p><span id="s529">15 The Nationaal Socialistische Beweging (National Socialist Movement), organized by Anton Adriaan Mussert in 1931, functioned as the Dutch Nazi Party.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: Now the, the the children were... Q: From the Creche, rather?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: The children were...when, when the family was picked up, adults went to the Schouwburg and the children went immediately to, to the Creche.</span> <span id="s532">They didn't...the children didn't stay at the Schouwburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: I realize that...</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: They were not really allowed to be in the Schouwburg.</span> <span id="s535">Q: But how were the children taken from the Creche...</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: From all kinds of...by all kinds of methods.</span> <span id="s537">Q: Such as?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: In the morning there was a back door through the garden and we took the, the, the, the, the children from...by the back door.</span> <span id="s539">And we went away.</span> <span id="s540">Sometimes the, the, the nurses, like Virrie Cohen, and so on, took the children on walk and we took them when they were walking, took two or three, and they came back with two or three less or four less, let's say.</span> <span id="s541">There were all kinds of methods to to get them out of the, the, the Creche.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: After your work with the Creche when there were no more children, the children were hidden, did you work with the adults then, helping adults?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: No.</span> <span id="s544">Because the, the, the, the...it's a mis...a misunderstanding that...that the Creche was the most important, uh, source of getting children.</span> <span id="s545">That's not true.</span> <span id="s546">I mean it was "A" source and some of the groups had more children from the Creche than the other ones.</span> <span id="s547">There were always, uh, parents who wanted to, who who were hiding, who were not hid...hiding and who wanted to hide...it was very difficult to hide with your children so then they they contacted us and we took the child one or two, and, and, and took it away, so it's, it's not only the Creche.</span> <span id="s548">It's, it's...you took it right from the parents.</span> <span id="s549">That was one of the reasons why I think we could do the job, because we were young and it's, it's a..</span> <span id="s550">.</span> <span id="s551">if you think about it now, today, as a father or a grandfather, it was absolutely inhuman to, to, to separate the child from the parents, and I think we, we could do it because we were not parents ourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">We...although we were very upset about it and we found it very difficult, we didn't quite realize how, how, how terrible it was, in my opinion.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: What happened to brothers and sisters or, I should say, siblings?</span> <span id="s554">Were they usually kept together, or were they placed with different families?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: It depended.</span> <span id="s556">I mean sometimes if, if it would be possible to put two boys, or let's say, brother and sister or two sisters at the same address, but most of the addresses didn't want to have two.</span> <span id="s557">It was too risky.</span> <span id="s558">So...and we didn't make a principle out of it.</span> <span id="s559">Just if it happened and we could find, uh, an address where they wanted two, uh, uh, two children, then, then, then of course we, we gave them a sister or two brothers.</span> <span id="s560">But it didn't happen many times.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Because...it...one child was danger; two children were even more dangerous.</span> <span id="s562">Q: What was the climate like at this time amongst the community in Amsterdam?</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: Very bitter.</span> <span id="s564">I, I think that the population of Amsterdam more than the rest of the population of Holland realized how, how bad it was and how inhuman the Dutch people--the German people were.</span> <span id="s565">I think they realized it.</span> <span id="s566">I, I can tell you a story which always sticks to my mind.</span> <span id="s567">Just in, in, in, in '42 when the first razzias were, uh, happening, I went to Friesland to look for addresses for the children.</span> <span id="s568">And, now Friesland is about a hundred and fifty kilometers from Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s569">And people didn't want to believe my story about razzias.</span> <span id="s570">They really didn't want to...I didn't succeed at all.</span> <span id="s571">It, it's, it's...and it's a hundred and fifty kilometers from, from Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s572">And only after half a year they accepted it, and ...they knew that it was true, but it took at least half the year for a hundred and fifty kilometer further... people realized what was happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: Why do you think that was?</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: I think that's, that's the way it is.</span> <span id="s575">People don't believe even things which are very near to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: What was happening to your family during this entire time?</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: My father died in '40 so I had no father anymore and my mother lived alone and she hided, uh, adults...adults.</span> <span id="s578">She had many adults in her house, but she was never caught.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: Never?</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: Never.</span> <span id="s581">She survived the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: Were you aware that she was hiding Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s584">She got...she got some of the, of the adults from me, so I knew.</span> <span id="s585">And she was willing to take the risk.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: And your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: I had no brother--my sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: Sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: My sister was like a..</span> <span id="s590">.</span> <span id="s591">as a nurse at the, at the hospital and she did a lot of, uh, illegal work too.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: Obviously you were in terrible danger, it goes without saying.</span> <span id="s593">Did you ever stop and think about how dangerous the situation was?</span> <span id="s594">What it meant for you to be involved in that kind of work?</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: I think that, as I, as I told you, I think...you don't want to do that.</span> <span id="s596">It's very dangerous to, to, uh...because, I think, if you realize the danger...of course you know it...but if you realize, you think of it, you can't work anymore.</span> <span id="s597">I think you, you, you would stop.</span> <span id="s598">You, you, you, you push it back.</span> <span id="s599">You, you don't want to be...you know, and that was in our case, of course, a very important thing.</span> <span id="s600">The responsibility toward the children.</span> <span id="s601">If anything happened to us...if you got tortured, uh, you could, you could give addresses or you could...you never know.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">That's why we were very cautious with the...for instance, the parents never knew where a child was hidden.</span> <span id="s603">That was one one absolute rule we never changed.</span> <span id="s604">And sometimes, the parents found out where the children were hidden and we moved them away because it was too dangerous.</span> <span id="s605">Dangerous for the child, dangerous for the, for the parents.</span> <span id="s606">On the other hand, I didn't know all the addresses.</span> <span id="s607">I only knew part of the addresses.</span> <span id="s608">And we had three separate lists and only a few...all the lists, all the three lists were together, you could find the children, so I could never betray the children.</span> <span id="s609">Neither could the girls or my partner.</span> <span id="s610">And I think that was the most essential thing where we were afraid of--that something would happen...that you would betray, had to betray the children....</span> <span id="s611">I mean, no one is a hero.</span> <span id="s612">With torture you can can...you never...you, you can't blame someone being tortured...betraying.</span> <span id="s613">There was a rule in, in the resistance that if someone was caught, within twenty-four hours, you had to, to, to, to, uh...not to say anything, betray anything within twenty-four hours; and after twenty-four hours you were allowed to betray because then everyone who was connected with you would have changed the address.</span> <span id="s614">And I think that's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: Were any of the people you worked with ever in close encounters?</span> <span id="s616">A: You want the record?</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: In the dangerous situation...</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s619">Two girls...two girls went to Ravensbrück.</span> <span id="s620">They were caught.</span> <span id="s621">Q: How were they caught?</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: One on the station in Utrecht.</span> <span id="s623">And the other one...I, I don't remember where she was caught.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Anyway, both girls were caught.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: Were the children with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: No.</span> <span id="s627">Fortunately, without children.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: How did the Germans and the Dutch police know to capture them there?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: They, they went into a trap.</span> <span id="s630">They...the one...I think the other one went into a house which...where the Germans were sitting and, uh, they caught her.</span> <span id="s631">Maybe this was identity or persoonbewijs material which was, uh, bad for them.</span> <span id="s632">But fortunately, our group was very lucky.</span> <span id="s633">I mean only two of all of them, and they survived, both.</span> <span id="s634">They survived Ravensbrück.</span> <span id="s635">The girls... they are still living.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: What did they do after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: Oh, they studied.</span> <span id="s638">One...one of the...one girl was studying with me law.</span> <span id="s639">We finished together law school and then she married and had children.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: I know there was no typical day for you, especially during the war, but what would it be like when you were to leave the house in the morning?</span></p> <p><span id="s641">INTERRUPTION - TECHNICAL CONVERSATION - PAUSE</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: I realize with all the work you did that there was no typical day, but can you describe what it was like, for instance, in the mornings and the evenings?</span> <span id="s643">Did you come home?</span> <span id="s644">Did you stay in other parts of the country during, uh, the time that you helped with the children?</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: It, it, it's difficult to say what a typical day was, because every day was different.</span> <span id="s646">I mean...uh, it, it's, uh, it depended, uh, how many, many appointments you had, where you had to go, if you had to go out of Amsterdam, had to go to, to Friesland or to Limburg.</span> <span id="s647">And, uh, I think it's very difficult to say typical day because there was never a typical day.</span> <span id="s648">Every day was, was, was, was...other than, than, than, the day before, but we, we cycled a lot through through Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s649">I've never cycled so much as in during these years.</span> <span id="s650">And, uh, don't forget, if, if you had to go to to Limburg and Friesland, it took you one day; the transportation was not that fast.</span> <span id="s651">There were no cars.</span> <span id="s652">We had to go by train, and then, then by bus and then we had to walk.</span> <span id="s653">I mean everything took long to to achieve.</span> <span id="s654">The whole, uh...that, that was the...one of the feelings which...that you have not enough time and that, uh, there was not enough hiding places and there were too many children to, to, to, to hide.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">That was a very bad feeling that, that we were so limited.</span> <span id="s656">And on the, on the other hand, you couldn't enlarge your, your, your group because it, it was dangerous.</span> <span id="s657">I mean, to enlarge it...I've seen one of the other groups who, who had the policy of, of taking all kinds of extra people, and they paid very, very much for that.</span> <span id="s658">They had a lot of casualties, because of that.</span> <span id="s659">We wanted to to have a very small but very first rule, our group, and the more people you, you took with you, the, the danger became much more.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: You mentioned that you had a bicycle.</span> <span id="s661">How was that-- that you were allowed a bike at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: Well, Germans tried to, to, to fetch the bikes, but they took another one--there were always bikes.</span> <span id="s663">There was no problem.</span> <span id="s664">The, the Germans were very keen on bikes.</span> <span id="s665">I know they, they, they steal them, but you always got another one.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: Were you stopped on bikes by the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: I never was.</span> <span id="s668">But some people were, some of my, uh, girls were.</span> <span id="s669">I never...never happened to me (laughter).</span> <span id="s670">I was lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: Did you have access to radios?</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: No.</span> <span id="s673">Once...two times I have sent a message to, to London through, uh, people whom I know that the special...again specialization of, of these people.</span> <span id="s674">They, they had the contacts with, with the government in London.</span> <span id="s675">But...I mean, they only did that, and nothing else.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: What did the message entail?</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: It was about something which, uh, I don't remember exactly what...I, I remember that it was on the radio.</span> <span id="s678">It was in code and I remember that we, we, we...they said it.</span> <span id="s679">I, I, I don't remember exactly what it was all about.</span> <span id="s680">I'm sorry, I don't know anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: Do you remember liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s683">Liberation in, in Amsterdam was very strange.</span> <span id="s684">Because there was a liberation, and then a day later there was a lot of shooting in Amsterdam near the Dam, and things like that.</span> <span id="s685">We were liberated...we are not liberated.</span> <span id="s686">Next day we were not liberated because there were still Germans fighting near the Dam.</span> <span id="s687">There were a lot of casualties the second day.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: Were you in Amsterdam during liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s690">But I was not there at the Dam.</span> <span id="s691">Fortunately I was not there.</span> <span id="s692">Q: And who liberated the city?</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: I think the Canadians...what I remember, it was the Canadians.</span> <span id="s694">Q: Where were you at the time of liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: I was living, uh, in a house with a lot of, uh, students and a lot of...of because, the last, uh, period...what I told you...Amsterdam was completely shut off from from from the country.</span> <span id="s696">We could go by bike but there were no...no trains and no transportation, so we lived with a lot of people in, in one house with a lot of students.</span> <span id="s697">And some some Jewish, uh, students and people too.</span> <span id="s698">They were hidden.</span> <span id="s699">Actually, there was one girl, a Jewish girl, who studied, uh, medicine at the university before she, uh, before she was, uh, not allowed to do that anymore.</span> <span id="s700">And she did all her examinations at our house.</span> <span id="s701">And the professors came to the house to take her examination, and she, uh...she, uh, worked the whole day in all kinds of, uh...there was no heating, so she she took everything, blankets and things around her and she studied the whole day and the, the... when she, when she was ready, her examinations were taken at, at the house.</span> <span id="s702">After the war she, she graduated and became a doctor.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: Can you describe or do you remember how you felt when you were liberated, what the feelings were?</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: I think it's the most wonderful feeling we ever had.</span> <span id="s705">I think that we'll never forget it.</span> <span id="s706">And on the other hand, it's very unrealistic.</span> <span id="s707">Uh, you you won't believe it.</span> <span id="s708">It's too good to be true, to, to believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: And what did you do that day when the city was liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: I think...I think.</span> <span id="s711">.</span> <span id="s712">everyone was on the street that day--the first day.</span> <span id="s713">Second day when the shooting was...the, the people...there were only a few people on the street.</span> <span id="s714">But the first day I think everyone was out in the streets.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: Let me backtrack for a moment.</span> <span id="s716">I know there was a terrible famine going on in the north at the time.</span> <span id="s717">How did you and your group find food?</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: Where was the famine?</span> <span id="s719">Not in the north...in, in Amsterdam, in the key cities, in Amsterdam, Rotterdam and The Hague.</span> <span id="s720">I I don't remember.</span> <span id="s721">I, I, I remember eating a lot of bulbs.</span> <span id="s722">It was good food, the bulbs.</span> <span id="s723">Anyway, we survived on it.</span> <span id="s724">We always had bulbs.</span> <span id="s725">Yeah, I remember, and sugar beets.</span> <span id="s726">Uh, that, that was a mixture of bulbs because...there was no bread.</span> <span id="s727">But we survived.</span> <span id="s728">A lot of people, uh, old and and sick people, of course, died but if you are young, you, you...that's not the most dramatic thing, I think.</span> <span id="s729">It's good to realize that you have hunger--that you have real hunger.</span> <span id="s730">I think it's, it's very good.</span> <span id="s731">I can never throw bread away, even now.</span> <span id="s732">It's very difficult for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: And what did you do, what happened to you after liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: After liberation, there was an office called the Office of the Oorloogpleegkinderenand, uh, I stayed for two months at the Office and, uh, because I had to, to, to, to look after our children that they were, uh, given to the parents and things like that.</span> <span id="s735">But I didn't want to do 16 The office that helped place hidden children with parents who had survived the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">that very long for two reasons - because I knew it would be a terrible fight between foster parents, and not, not the, the parents because if the parents returned, there was no question about it.</span> <span id="s737">They went to the parents.</span> <span id="s738">But we knew that ...that the...there would be all kinds of, of problems when, let's say, an uncle of sixty years of age came back, and, and, uh, a girl of ten had to go to that uncle.</span> <span id="s739">And then the poor foster parents would say, "Now, we think the child should stay here," and I didn't want to get involved with these kind of problems.</span> <span id="s740">I had enough, I thought the children are, are safe.</span> <span id="s741">I didn't want...I didn't want to, to, to continue; I wanted to finish my studies.</span> <span id="s742">I was really three years out of my studies.</span> <span id="s743">And I, I was married already at the time.</span> <span id="s744">I wanted to finish my studies, so I quit after two months.</span> <span id="s745">And I, I was right because there was a terrible fight after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: You mentioned you were married.</span> <span id="s747">How did you meet your wife?</span> <span id="s748">A: She was one of the girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: One of your girls?</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: And then what happened to you...in other words, after the war, as far as your life was concerned?</span> <span id="s752">What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: Well, what I really...what I did, right after the war, a lot of the students who had had been completely independent...we were not dependent on our parents anymore...and we didn't want to...there were no scholarships at the time, in Holland.</span> <span id="s754">And we wanted to be free and to...not to ask our parents for, for, for a, uh, an amount of money and a month's to stay.</span> <span id="s755">We didn't like that anymore, so that's why I came into the show business, because with a lot of the students from, from, from our...not from our group, but from all kinds of groups.</span> <span id="s756">We, uh, took, we...had a idea to, to establish a cinema, an art-house cinema, which we did.</span> <span id="s757">We opened it in November 1944.</span> <span id="s758">And all the students worked there, and earned their way of living.</span> <span id="s759">It still exists.</span> <span id="s760">Forty-five years.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Q: When you say cinema, were you talking about film or...?</span></p> <p><span id="s762">A: Film.</span> <span id="s763">Yeah.</span> <span id="s764">It's called the Kritierion, and it's still there.</span> <span id="s765">It's still run by the students.</span> <span id="s766">Q: And you had mentioned the theater before.</span> <span id="s767">Did you pursue the theater?</span></p> <p><span id="s768">A: Afterwards I went into the cinema, the theatre business, but it was ten years later.</span> <span id="s769">Q: About '55.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: Yeah, about '55.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: And you did...or you do what?</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: I, I was managing director of the Cinema House...the theatre.</span> <span id="s773">And I produced musicals, plays, and things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q: Is there anything that you'd like to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A: I hope I've said enough for you.</span> <span id="s776">It's up to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: I'd like to ask if there's anything that you'd like to mention after the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s779">I, I wanted to say one thing which I think is, is very important.</span> <span id="s780">There has been many times that people attacked the Jews that they didn't resist enough.</span> <span id="s781">And I think that's very unfair because it's not true.</span> <span id="s782">As I told you, I worked with many Jewish people who risked their life for, for the other ones.</span> <span id="s783">And I think...I mean the position was that bad that for a Jew it was...the risk was so enormous, was ten times more than, than for us, and if you compare it to the people of the Dutch, uh, population who, who, who were really active in the resistance, it's only maybe one or two percent, and I think the same and maybe better if you take the, the Jewish population...there were at least two percent Jews who resisted, so I think this is a very unfair criticism, and it's not true.</span> <span id="s784">They were not different from, from...they were not, not, not less active as the non-Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: Now that you've had the time to think about it and years have passed, if you had it to do all over again, would you?</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s787">I, I can't answer that.</span> <span id="s788">It...it's not...I think it will never happen again.</span> <span id="s789">There's not the same, same situation.</span> <span id="s790">There will never be a sit...we all hope there will never be the same situation.</span> <span id="s791">It's such an extreme, uh, uh, situation and hopefully there will never be anything like that.</span> <span id="s792">No.</span> <span id="s793">But I can't say how I would react.</span> <span id="s794">You...no...the only thing is that that I'm always astonished...still astonished that it happened.</span> <span id="s795">It's unbelievable.</span> <span id="s796">For me it's still unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: Anything else?</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A: No.</span></p></body></html>
