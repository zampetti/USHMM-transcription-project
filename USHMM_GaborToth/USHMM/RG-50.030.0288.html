us.</span> <span id="s39">But after a while, started to get rougher.</span> <span id="s40">The younger generation grew up and became like here -- some of them, against the Jewry.</span> <span id="s41">They didn't want the Jews to come to their town to sell something.</span> <span id="s42">Just to go around in the town -- used to go around with needles, thread.</span> <span

couldn't ask for more.</span> <span id="s57">Because that's what it was.</span> <span id="s58">A small town and too 1 The town of Stoczek is also referred to as Stok.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">many of everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">01:04:44 Too many of everything.</span> <span id="s61">Like too many tailors, too many shoemakers, too many carpenters, everything.</span> <span id="s62">We

bring potatoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Other things, chickens, butters, cheeses.</span> <span id="s66">People used to go out to buy it.</span> <span id="s67">It was -- somebody used to have stands outside, like pushcarts, to sell something to them.</span> <span id="s68">That was the living.</span> <span id="s69">'Til, 'til 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: Ok, now if you – [technical conversation].</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: That was started after the war -- before '39, they used to call them [inaudible].</span> <span id="s72">People used to call them, some dishes to sell outside the market.</span> <span id="s73">Then the youngsters, the youngsters -- the Polish boys came up and used to throw them around and kick on them.</span> <span id="s74">And suddenly it was very hard to stay in business.</span> <span id="s75">It started -- this started -- it started this way and we survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">We survived ‘til, 'til 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: Now you said you -- were you -- were there any Zionists or political organizations in your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: There were Zionists, yes.</span> <span id="s79">Very few.</span> <span id="s80">As a matter of fact, I was belonged to the Kibbutz [inaudible], to go to kibbutz and go to, after while go to Israel to work.</span> <span id="s81">Or else in by us, we had to respect for our parents, and my father said "No, No."</span> <span id="s82">He had made [inaudible].</span> <span id="s83">After a while, I find out he made a lot of money.</span> <span id="s84">Because he was butcher, he want I should be a butcher.</span> <span id="s85">I could be something else.</span> <span id="s86">I'm going to be something else.</span> <span id="s87">I could make a better living.</span> <span id="s88">There's too many -- too many this.</span> <span id="s89">Another brother wanted to be a butcher, and have two younger brothers, they want -- they will wind up to own carpenters.</span> <span id="s90">I didn't --</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: Then you were interested in the politics of the Zionist movement?</span> <span id="s92">01:07:22</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s94">I always talked about it with the “run away with,” that term, because it was not pleasure there.</span> <span id="s95">Was nothing.</span> <span id="s96">I had four boys.</span> <span id="s97">What do you think was to grow up?</span> <span id="s98">Like same thing – working.</span> <span id="s99">It was not -- even in schools, were afraid to go to school, because they used to get beaten up by Polish boys because they were more in -- they started to go to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">And if you didn't want to go to school, you weren't punished.</span> <span id="s101">You didn't have to go to school, because nobody was interested.</span> <span id="s102">The government wasn't interested in you didn't go to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: But they went -- did they go to the same school with the Polish boys?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s105">They go to the same school.</span> <span id="s106">Of course, a couple classes -- it was about two or three classes in our town was for Jewish kids only.</span> <span id="s107">After a while, the higher classmate have to go together.</span> <span id="s108">What's troubling, you are afraid to go because no-- nobody was, nobody -- it was nobody was stopping them to do anything.</span> <span id="s109">There was no punishment.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: Let's -- now, at this point, had you – [technical conversation].</span> <span id="s111">Before 1939, had you heard a lot about Hitler and the Nazism?</span> <span id="s112">Did you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s114">In 1939, 1940 -- '35 -- a lot of Germans on the way from their town came, it's Poland.</span> <span id="s115">When they used to tell us stories, nobody could believe them.</span> <span id="s116">Nobody wanted to believe them.</span> <span id="s117">Even, even in '38, even in '38, they came back and they came into our town and they told us a story.</span> <span id="s118">We didn't believe it.</span> <span id="s119">We didn't believe them when they said, even in 1939, they took over in Poland.</span> <span id="s120">The gentile people used to go, they used to deal with them, with us.</span> <span id="s121">They used to buy from the kosher butcher.</span> <span id="s122">The Jewish people eat only the front part of the meat and the back part used to sell it to them.</span> <span id="s123">They used to take it to different big cities and sell it there and make a living.</span> <span id="s124">They came back from Warsaw and they told us -- they said that they were going to kill Polish Jews.</span> <span id="s125">We didn't pay too much attention.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">01:10:18 We were, at that time, tied in already, because when the Germans came into house they used to beat us up and then let us go.</span> <span id="s127">They caught somebody -- as a matter of fact a Jew that was on the market buy wood.</span> <span id="s128">They came in to buy the wood, he bought the wood, that wood was stolen.</span> <span id="s129">The police, the Germans, they didn't punish the guy who bought -- who stole -- the wood.</span> <span id="s130">They punished the Jew who bought the wood.</span> <span id="s131">He didn't know.</span> <span id="s132">He needed the wood, he bought it.</span> <span id="s133">So they took him and they send him away to Treblinka.</span> <span id="s134">It was Treblinka, not -- there was two of them.</span> <span id="s135">One of them was just for punishing gentile people.</span> <span id="s136">Jewish people, but they did something wrong from the beginning.</span> <span id="s137">They didn't take them to kill yet.</span> <span id="s138">So that was the start of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: Now you said you were in the Polish army?</span> <span id="s140">A: I was the Polish Army, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: A lot of Jews in the Polish Army?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: Was, there was, because a lot of -- they didn't take everybody to the army because some of the numbers like here, you know?</span> <span id="s143">So they didn't go.</span> <span id="s144">I went.</span> <span id="s145">A lot of people went, went to the army.</span> <span id="s146">I was in the army then, in the reserve.</span> <span id="s147">The war started, they took me into the reserve.</span> <span id="s148">I was in Warsaw, the capital.</span> <span id="s149">I was supposed to be -- whenever I had a gun in my hands, I never put a bullet in it.</span> <span id="s150">It was, it was taken over by them like, like nothing.</span> <span id="s151">They used to bomb that city and people were killed, the horses were killed.</span> <span id="s152">They used to go out, the people used to go out, take knives, cut off pieces of meat from the horses, from the dead horses outside.</span> <span id="s153">They used to take it home and cook it and eat these things.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: Now tell me a little bit about when the war started.</span> <span id="s155">Where were you, what was happening?</span> <span id="s156">01:12:32</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: Well, after the war, after the war finished, the Germans took over.</span> <span id="s158">I came home.</span> <span id="s159">I came with the [inaudible].</span> <span id="s160">We went to buy a piece -- steal by a farmer.</span> <span id="s161">We used to sell it to a make a living.</span> <span id="s162">I started to make a living.</span> <span id="s163">Worse and worse.</span> <span id="s164">We couldn't go out, they locked us in.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">They put us in a lot of punishments.</span> <span id="s166">And sometimes at night Germans came in.</span> <span id="s167">They didn't want to do it -- they would find something they wanted.</span> <span id="s168">They didn't want the stock.</span> <span id="s169">They want we should pay money.</span> <span id="s170">And have us put to jail.</span> <span id="s171">We have to pay them off not to touch us.</span> <span id="s172">And money wasn't around.</span> <span id="s173">Couldn't -- couldn't produce, we couldn't make it.</span> <span id="s174">We couldn't call into farmers, bring in some stuff.</span> <span id="s175">We couldn't go out.</span> <span id="s176">So it got tougher and tougher.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: What -- do you remember the date your town was occupied?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: The Germans occupied this 1939 in -- I think it was before the Jewish holidays.</span> <span id="s179">In October, something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: August, maybe?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: August of 1939?</span> <span id="s183">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: It was in summertime, I know this.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: In September of 1939, the Germans came into Poland -- A: It was at that time it was occupied.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: Did they come to your town afterwards?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: They came right away.</span> <span id="s188">All over.</span> <span id="s189">They came all over.</span> <span id="s190">I can remember because I know it was in the summer.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: But after you left Warsaw it was right away?</span> <span id="s192">01:14:30</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: After I left Warsaw, as a matter of fact, I was a -- they had keep us about two weeks.</span> <span id="s194">The Germans kept us.</span> <span id="s195">And then they gave us the leaves and I started to want to go home.</span> <span id="s196">I had to walk about 70 miles home.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: So by the time you got home, were the Germans in your town also?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: They were there.</span> <span id="s199">They were all over Poland right away.</span> <span id="s200">Because they came in, they came in there, and as a matter of fact, in our side of the town, the Germans -- it was Russia and Germany did business, in the beginning.</span> <span id="s201">They did business.</span> <span id="s202">They used to bring this -- they used to trade wood for coal, a lot of things, they did business in the beginning, yeah.</span> <span id="s203">So the Germans were there.</span> <span id="s204">And it used to make me almost -- took people to work everyday almost in our town.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: Ok.</span> <span id="s206">So after the Germans came in, they made life very difficult for you.</span> <span id="s207">Were you put into a ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: It was a ghetto, yeah.</span> <span id="s209">The ghetto was -- we couldn't -- we weren't allowed to go out to do business anywhere else.</span> <span id="s210">Only sneaked in through the different roads because we were living there, but you know -- sneak in, sneak in.</span> <span id="s211">That's why we survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: Was there any semblance?</span> <span id="s213">Your town is now a ghetto.</span> <span id="s214">It's difficult to get in and out.</span> <span id="s215">Was there any normal life?</span> <span id="s216">Did people go to school?</span> <span id="s217">Did you still pray?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: No schools for anybody.</span> <span id="s219">Not even -- not only for Jews, but for the non-Jews, too.</span> <span id="s220">No school at all.</span> <span id="s221">The occupation, the occupation of the Germans, there was no school, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: Were you able to go to synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: There was no synagogue.</span> <span id="s224">It got burnt.</span> <span id="s225">The synagogue got burnt, half of the town got burnt.</span> <span id="s226">Q: So the Poles were in bad shape, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: Not the Poles.</span> <span id="s228">The Poles, most of them were lots of farmers.</span> <span id="s229">The others managed to do something.</span> <span id="s230">They could go around and they could maneuver around from one town to the other.</span> <span id="s231">But there was no punishment for them.</span> <span id="s232">They said that they didn't, they didn't suffer that much a loss.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: So there really was nothing you could do.</span> <span id="s234">Were people working?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: Only worker, yeah.</span> <span id="s236">The people that were farmers, they used to bring in some stuff, a pair of shoes.</span> <span id="s237">Tailors, because they didn't have -- very few Gentile people were tailors.</span> <span id="s238">Most of the Jews were the tailors and they brought their stuff to them.</span> <span id="s239">They didn't go nowhere.</span> <span id="s240">They could -- they were allowed to come into church.</span> <span id="s241">They were allowed to come into the city.</span> <span id="s242">But they weren't allowed.</span> <span id="s243">The Nazis, they gave them money, they brought them in some food.</span> <span id="s244">Flour, potatoes, other things, too.</span> <span id="s245">Only for Jews, for a lot of Jews this was too many for us, especially for our profession, was very risky.</span> <span id="s246">You couldn't -- you weren't allowed to go to farmer to buy these cattle.</span> <span id="s247">It was very risky.</span> <span id="s248">If we killed the cattle, it was also very risky.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">You were not supposed to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: So were you out of work then?</span> <span id="s251">01:18:40</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: I was out of work, yeah.</span> <span id="s253">We lived whatever we could get.</span> <span id="s254">I used to buy the flour, we used to make our own bread.</span> <span id="s255">We used to do -- we had water.</span> <span id="s256">Salt.</span> <span id="s257">And that was good.</span> <span id="s258">We didn't ask any more.</span> <span id="s259">So long we had a piece of bread on the -- most of the -- feed the children.</span> <span id="s260">Milk was very hard to get, because they didn't have the money to buy the milk from the farmer.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: Did -- was there a lot of brutality towards you by the Germans?</span> <span id="s262">Did they beat people?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: Oh, they beat people with when they find them.</span> <span id="s264">They didn't came into the houses looking for-- at that time it was not the order yet.</span> <span id="s265">They didn't start at that time the order to kill the people yet.</span> <span id="s266">The people -- about a year -- about two years -- a year and a half they were -- they didn't bother with everybody.</span> <span id="s267">They didn't bother them because they made ghettos.</span> <span id="s268">And they tried to depress the people.</span> <span id="s269">They should give up faster, they shouldn't fight back.</span> <span id="s270">They want to depress them.</span> <span id="s271">They have more strength than to lose because they didn't have enough food to eat -- the other couple kids was -- your family had seven kids, too.</span> <span id="s272">And you have to feed them, each one of them -- 10 pounds potatoes was not enough to feed 10 people, nine people.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: Were there work brigades?</span> <span id="s274">A: Hmm?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: Were there work brigades?</span> <span id="s276">Did they send any of the Jews out to do work?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s278">They used to catch us.</span> <span id="s279">Do work, spent a lot of time to make water digs, to make for farmers, not for ours.</span> <span id="s280">And they used to take us, and a lot of people didn't know how to work.</span> <span id="s281">They got beaten up.</span> <span id="s282">Were not physically fit.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: Were there shootings?</span> <span id="s284">A: Hmm?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: Anybody get shot?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: No shooting.</span> <span id="s287">They beat them up.</span> <span id="s288">A bullet is too much.</span> <span id="s289">Save a bullet.</span> <span id="s290">Kill them with the sticks and anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: Did the local Polish people -- were they nice to you or were they beating you up, too?</span> <span id="s292">A: Well, they were nice.</span> <span id="s293">They didn't bother us.</span> <span id="s294">They didn't help either.</span> <span id="s295">Many of the local farmers -- we have a lot -- in our profession, we have a lot -- we deal with a lot of farmers.</span> <span id="s296">If they come, they try to do--.</span> <span id="s297">Really, they was staying away from the Jews.</span> <span id="s298">Most of the time, they didn't want -- they wouldn't get in trouble.</span> <span id="s299">So I didn't blame them because everybody works for themselves.</span> <span id="s300">So it wasn't good for anybody.</span> <span id="s301">It wasn't good for the Polish people, either.</span> <span id="s302">You gave them, told them to bring in stuff but they need it for themself.</span> <span id="s303">And like meat, and everything, they confiscated and everything you want, they did with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: Now, I know that .</span> <span id="s305">I know how you happened to leave your town.</span> <span id="s306">But were there, up until the time you left, round-ups of people?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: Oh, you mean concentration camp.</span> <span id="s308">To Treblinka, you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: To anywhere.</span> <span id="s310">Did they come to the town and gather people together and send them to work, to camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s312">They used to go.</span> <span id="s313">There was a Judenrat.You know what a Judenrat is?</span> <span id="s314">They took the Judenrat and they were responsible -- they came in and they want a supply, some of them made the Jewish.</span> <span id="s315">They came in, the Judenrat, the police; got some -- like a list -- and used to come in and take me or take somebody else.</span> <span id="s316">They had to supply as many people they wanted.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: What did you think of the Judenrat?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s319">I don't know.</span> <span id="s320">I'm going to tell you this.</span> <span id="s321">The only way they did that, they had no choice.</span> <span id="s322">They had to do something because otherwise -- a lot of them did it, overdid it.</span> <span id="s323">Most of them had no choice.</span> <span id="s324">They had to supply the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">01:23:22</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: So the council was -- would gather people for work or for something.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: Oh, the most important thing is that they came home that night.</span> <span id="s328">If they don't, they get weaker every day.</span> <span id="s329">They couldn't work, they couldn't do anything when -- because if you don't eat, you can't produce.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: How did you happen to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: I have had to eat.</span> <span id="s332">One bed for the other, that's all.</span> <span id="s333">Nothing -- a dollar left over for next week.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s335">I was asking you how you happened to leave the city.</span> <span id="s336">For Treblinka.</span> <span id="s337">How -- what was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">2 Jewish Council (German).</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: Well, it was panic.</span> <span id="s340">Everybody else is panicking, everybody is afraid because we saw what's going on and started to -- they were taking up people from Warsaw already.</span> <span id="s341">They were taking up, bringing from the big cities.</span> <span id="s342">Scared.</span> <span id="s343">We heard about the Russians.</span> <span id="s344">From the beginning Russia lost the war.</span> <span id="s345">We hoped, but the hope never came.</span> <span id="s346">It came too late.</span> <span id="s347">So I came in that date when they, after do this.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">01:25:00 They started to bring in the Jews from [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s349">They needed some helpers.</span> <span id="s350">So they went into Warsaw and they told people in Warsaw -- they were starving there in the streets, and a lot of people had nothing to eat -- in the ghettos because the poor people didn't have no money to pay for anything.</span> <span id="s351">Everything was so expensive.</span> <span id="s352">The rich people didn't want to share with anybody.</span> <span id="s353">They thought maybe they want to live for themself.</span> <span id="s354">Even they had enough, but they didn't -- even they went in to talk to them -- to the big people, the manufacturers there.</span> <span id="s355">"Give us money, we going to buy some ammunition with."</span> <span id="s356">“Don't bother me.”</span> <span id="s357">They didn't want nothing to do with them.</span> <span id="s358">Because they -- maybe they will fight for themself.</span> <span id="s359">Everybody was selfish.</span> <span id="s360">They always worried about for themself.</span> <span id="s361">After a while, they came into Warsaw, they told the people if you to have a job, working, I'll give you room and board.</span> <span id="s362">So a lot of -- came out and said they want to go.</span> <span id="s363">They took them, they put them in -- was about 300 people there.</span> <span id="s364">At Treblinka, before I came there.</span> <span id="s365">And they started to building the dam.</span> <span id="s366">Only they were so poorly, the help was so poorly because it was starving before, they had nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s367">What are they going to do?</span> <span id="s368">Came there, in the start of they gave me shovels to dig.</span> <span id="s369">To make the grave for the -- prepare for the people -- for the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s370">To make -- they started to do that.</span> <span id="s371">They couldn't do the job.</span> <span id="s372">They took a couple days.</span> <span id="s373">They took them.</span> <span id="s374">They used to line them up in three, take them into a grave and shoot them.</span> <span id="s375">Then they came into our town.</span> <span id="s376">And they took us and they came in.</span> <span id="s377">It was a Thursday morning.</span> <span id="s378">I remember that day, that morning, and heard something was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">01:27:04</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: What year?</span> <span id="s381">When was this?</span> <span id="s382">What year?</span> <span id="s383">A: It was in '42.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: And do you remember the month?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: It was summertime.</span> <span id="s386">I know it was about May or June.</span> <span id="s387">Because I know down the field, because I was hiding there in the field.</span> <span id="s388">And I jumped up to the window.</span> <span id="s389">Back, back in our room there was a field there.</span> <span id="s390">And people and I hided myself there.</span> <span id="s391">And one Ukrainian came there and find me there.</span> <span id="s392">And came with a gun, I thought they were going to kill them there.</span> <span id="s393">He took me -- he had surrounded the barn, that and 10 boys, young people.</span> <span id="s394">He put us in jail 'til they finish up the whole thing.</span> <span id="s395">They took us out; they came in with trucks.</span> <span id="s396">They put us on truck; they started to travel to Treblinka.</span> <span id="s397">And we were traveling, and there they picked up, picked up a couple bicycles there from somebody and put us on our heads.</span> <span id="s398">And then we were traveling in a yellow truck.</span> <span id="s399">There were three [inaudible].</span> <span id="s400">They used to take -- traveling there they took cigarettes.</span> <span id="s401">Some, they were boldy.</span> <span id="s402">They lighted up the cigarettes and put them in there and burn them.</span> <span id="s403">Finally we came in, took us to that concentration camp, Treblinka.</span> <span id="s404">And we came up in the truck.</span> <span id="s405">And they told -- finally, we finally came into that pensjonat.You know what pensjonat means?</span> <span id="s406">Like a hotel.</span> <span id="s407">Finally we came into Hotel Treblinka.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: I'm going to stop you for one minute.</span> <span id="s409">I just wanted -- how long did it take you to get there, and how many people were in with this group on the trucks?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: About 150 people.</span> <span id="s411">150 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: 150?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: And it took how long?</span> <span id="s415">A: Hmm?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: How long, how long was the distance to get there?</span> <span id="s417">A: Oh, it was -- took a couple of hours.</span> <span id="s418">Couple of hours.</span> <span id="s419">01:29:33 End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s420">3 Hotel (Polish).</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s422">02:01:22</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: Did you, did you know about Treblinka before?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: I know the town was a railroad place.</span> <span id="s425">They had a small stop there.</span> <span id="s426">They used to -- trains stopped there.</span> <span id="s427">So in the way to that station they made an extension, they made an extension to that Treblinka, they called it Treblinka.</span> <span id="s428">That was a desert.</span> <span id="s429">A piece of land unworkable for farmers, just a piece of desert.</span> <span id="s430">But they came, when I came in there, when they took us from the truck -- in the truck everybody... Anybody wouldn't have no shovel is going to get killed.</span> <span id="s431">But everybody was grabbing -- the shovels, and was maybe 20 left over.</span> <span id="s432">And we started to work.</span> <span id="s433">Same day we work.</span> <span id="s434">And physically, I was built good, strong.</span> <span id="s435">People, other people in the town they never did a hard work in their life.</span> <span id="s436">The skin of their -- it was soft.</span> <span id="s437">If you started to use a shovel for a long time, you get blisters on the fingers.</span> <span id="s438">You can't work.</span> <span id="s439">They couldn't produce.</span> <span id="s440">So, they were working; they couldn't produce.</span> <span id="s441">And it was one German sitting on the top, watching.</span> <span id="s442">All were crying.</span> <span id="s443">Some people that wouldn't produce used to call him up -- come up -- and they took him, they tied in their legs to the -- like a bench.</span> <span id="s444">Tie the legs to a bench.</span> <span id="s445">He told him to bend down, and took off -- put down -- your pants down.</span> <span id="s446">He took two canes -- not -- canes and they beat him, one on this side and one on the other side.</span> <span id="s447">They beat him up so much, then they took him to the edge from the grave and they pushed him down.</span> <span id="s448">He fell over.</span> <span id="s449">He refused to stand up.</span> <span id="s450">Right away they get him to work.</span> <span id="s451">They took him off again and it was finished.</span> <span id="s452">He was finished, couldn't do nothing.</span> <span id="s453">I was trying not to get up there.</span> <span id="s454">They didn't hurt me.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: Now what -- where was the rest of your family at this time?</span> <span id="s456">02:04:10</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: Weren't in my town yet.</span> <span id="s458">I was there about seven months before them.</span> <span id="s459">They took me away before.</span> <span id="s460">And they were -- it was hoped -- they used to come -- they allowed --they made a deal with the Germans, they let one girl come in every week and bring a -- some bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Bring in and some notes that they gave.</span> <span id="s462">“We are working on it, you're going to be free.</span> <span id="s463">You're going free, you're going free.”</span> <span id="s464">I had opportunity to run away that time, also.</span> <span id="s465">Because -- but I didn't want to run away because I was afraid for my family.</span> <span id="s466">Because if they know I run away, they know where I came.</span> <span id="s467">They going to punish my family.</span> <span id="s468">They were waiting and waiting.</span> <span id="s469">And when we got hope, 'til the time came, and they took, they took us out, all of them, about a couple hundred -- about a hundred people -- 120 people -- and they stood us in line and said, "Who wants to go home, and who wants to stay here?"</span> <span id="s470">Everyone wants to go home.</span> <span id="s471">So I went in the line -- “I want to go home.”</span> <span id="s472">Right after, they didn't let us go.</span> <span id="s473">They let us go and I went in the -- back to sleep.</span> <span id="s474">And I was laying in the bed and something came into my mind.</span> <span id="s475">If they going to be free, I'm going to be free -- a week later, two weeks later.</span> <span id="s476">I went back to the line, I want to stay.</span> <span id="s477">So those people, they separated.</span> <span id="s478">They took them a different place.</span> <span id="s479">I never saw them again.</span> <span id="s480">They took them a different place and started to bring in the cars with Jews to kill them off.</span> <span id="s481">Those people were with the dead ones.</span> <span id="s482">And I was working with the working people.</span> <span id="s483">They have to build beds for the -- and build barracks for them, I was working for them.</span> <span id="s484">That's why I was working.</span> <span id="s485">And they used to bring -- every day they started to bring in a hundred cars, and each car was that -- a hundred people in each car.</span> <span id="s486">In the beginning they didn't -- when they came off the car, I wasn't there.</span> <span id="s487">Only the workers, if they needed something to fix, I was -- I used to go up there.</span> <span id="s488">There was some soon as they got off the car, the people were glad they were coming off, because a hundred people in the car and the trip used to take four or five hours.</span> <span id="s489">They'd keep them for 24 hours.</span> <span id="s490">It made them so weak, they were -- they couldn't -- they didn't care anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">02:07:17 So they told them, the first thing, take off the jacket.</span> <span id="s492">After -- and the overcoat, then the jacket.</span> <span id="s493">And 'til they came to the end, they were naked.</span> <span id="s494">And they were in line to go, they were put in the concentration camp, in the chamber, the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s495">I saw the gas chamber before they started to build because I was there and was doing some work there.</span> <span id="s496">And I couldn't, because my destination, I couldn't even think about it.</span> <span id="s497">There was going to be something to kill people.</span> <span id="s498">I thought it was looked like a shower.</span> <span id="s499">Looked -- openings on the ceilings like water will come, you know.</span> <span id="s500">That's what I figured.</span> <span id="s501">I didn't figure they would do this thing, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: Were you involved in building it or not?</span> <span id="s503">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: Did you help build it?</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: I helped them build it, yeah.</span> <span id="s506">But all the work there was -- I used to go to the forest, I cut -- chopped young trees and bring it in.</span> <span id="s507">I used to go and a German used to take me and a few people together and we used to go bring in the -- those things to build there.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: So you built barracks?</span> <span id="s509">A: Barracks, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: And the gas chamber?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: The gas chamber I wasn't building because it was professional people was making bricks, you see.</span> <span id="s512">This was people, I don't know, I think was Germans allowed to build it -- build this thing.</span> <span id="s513">They built one, one small in -- on the first grave.</span> <span id="s514">They put in the people and they covered them with dirt and cloths there.</span> <span id="s515">And after a while, they stopped for a couple weeks and they came in, a lot of mechanics came in.</span> <span id="s516">They built another one.</span> <span id="s517">A big gas chamber.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Bigger one.</span> <span id="s519">And they took in, they took in steam shovels to build, to dig.</span> <span id="s520">After a while, they didn't put them in the graves anymore.</span> <span id="s521">They made -- from the tracks from the railroad, they made like a -- like a screen -- laid like this -- and they put them at the -- in the fire in the bottom that went in.</span> <span id="s522">And they used to, they used to dig up the people that were buried before: a year ago, six months ago, they used to dig them up and they with the steam shovels and I used to see from my inside where I was working -- I used to see a hand, a foot, there was bodies.</span> <span id="s523">It was such a smell that people got -- a lot of people got sick there.</span> <span id="s524">Died off in that thing.</span> <span id="s525">Well, I had mine -- what's the name -- typhus -- before I went in.</span> <span id="s526">I was lucky that time I didn't catch it because I was -- before I went in the concentration camp I was sick and nothing had survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: So you were working in a separate part.</span> <span id="s528">You were not working in the same place where they</span></p> <p><span id="s529">--</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: Was separated, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s531">Q: You were in the lower camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: Lower camp, yeah.</span> <span id="s533">Anything that had to be fixed, I had to go in.</span> <span id="s534">Was the -- call it -- the other place -- lazaret.They call it lazaret.</span> <span id="s535">It means -- the German is a hospital, something like this.</span> <span id="s536">They took the people -- sick people.</span> <span id="s537">They came in, a lot of young people came in with carriages and babies.</span> <span id="s538">They took the carriages away with them and the sick people, they came up in the train -- they put them in that carriages and they brought them over.</span> <span id="s539">Was a fire, burning on inside there.</span> <span id="s540">And they told them, we come in, we going to take them to the doctor.</span> <span id="s541">We going to fix you.</span> <span id="s542">And at that time I was there fixing that thing, somebody got burned there.</span> <span id="s543">The -- a place where they were standing there with rails and hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">02:11:43 So caught on fire, got burnt.</span> <span id="s545">I had to fix it there.</span> <span id="s546">And I saw, they came in with a lot of these people.</span> <span id="s547">And they tell them, wait a minute, the doctor's coming.</span> <span id="s548">They took them off in a carriage where they let them stay.</span> <span id="s549">The doctors that came right away, they took the crying people, they took guns and they shoot them and they fell in, right on the fire.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: You saw this?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: I saw this.</span> <span id="s552">Yeah.</span> <span id="s553">Only once over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: When you saw something like this what were you thinking in terms of your own security?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: Own security was like a -- put you in with tigers.</span> <span id="s556">In a tiger cage.</span> <span id="s557">You stay, you couldn't do nothing.</span> <span id="s558">You couldn't do -- because the only hope was maybe, maybe even the people that go into the hospital you see is dying right away, you still hope something.</span> <span id="s559">“Maybe, maybe.”</span> <span id="s560">That was our -- some people lost their will.</span> <span id="s561">Some people had, “Maybe, maybe, maybe.”</span> <span id="s562">So 4 Field hospital (Polish, archaic).</span></p> <p><span id="s563">long as we -- I could walk around, physically, good strength, I hoped maybe something would happen.</span> <span id="s564">The war -- some days they took, they took people.</span> <span id="s565">They started to get scared, thought maybe, everybody was disgusted.</span> <span id="s566">Maybe we will started to make an uprise.</span> <span id="s567">They started to -- they took the people, they took -- they put all of them on one lot in a circle, and they were in the middle and they told us.</span> <span id="s568">They took two people out of there and they said, "These two people want to run away."</span> <span id="s569">So they need somebody to make a hanging noose -- what do you call it?</span> <span id="s570">To hang them up.</span> <span id="s571">To make a pole like this and one stick like this and two like this, and picked people to make that thing.</span> <span id="s572">And they hung them by the legs.</span> <span id="s573">Not by the head.</span> <span id="s574">And they were hollering.</span> <span id="s575">There was -- "What are you waiting for?</span> <span id="s576">You think they going to do -- you going to go out?"</span> <span id="s577">And we were standing in line, standing there and helpless.</span> <span id="s578">Maybe we were -- all together, maybe, we could have done something.</span> <span id="s579">Maybe we could kill them all, because they -- my jobs are there.</span> <span id="s580">But everybody was so scared.</span> <span id="s581">So scared.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: Now I want to go back a little bit.</span> <span id="s583">When you arrived, you started working right away.</span> <span id="s584">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: And you said that the area was really a desert.</span> <span id="s586">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: Were there many buildings there already?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: No buildings.</span> <span id="s589">Was only building was the building for the Germans to live in.</span> <span id="s590">Living quarter.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">For them.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: And what about the other camp?</span> <span id="s593">The other prison camp that was already there?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: The prison camp was started to build, it was there some like a barns.</span> <span id="s595">Nothing there.</span> <span id="s596">Just four walls and a roof.</span> <span id="s597">That's all that was there.</span> <span id="s598">Nothing made for us to sleep.</span> <span id="s599">I used to -- I build the beds for them to make sleep.</span> <span id="s600">We took lumber and made it like this.</span> <span id="s601">Because -- long bunks.</span> <span id="s602">You made it like this.</span> <span id="s603">At top, higher.</span> <span id="s604">And below, lower.</span> <span id="s605">And that's where we slept.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Out there on this thing.</span> <span id="s607">At night we were locked in.</span> <span id="s608">We couldn't go nowhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">02:15:40 We were barred this side and barred that side.</span> <span id="s610">And on the back -- in the front was guards.</span> <span id="s611">And that's who was standing there.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: Did you get enough to eat?</span> <span id="s613">Were you able to take showers?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: No, no showers, no.</span> <span id="s615">Well, no showers.</span> <span id="s616">You could never have to change our shirt.</span> <span id="s617">We couldn't change our shoes, couldn't change anything.</span> <span id="s618">Was nothing there to -- was not the supplies for us.</span> <span id="s619">No supplies.</span> <span id="s620">Only food.</span> <span id="s621">Because they needed us to help them doing -- operate a factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: So what kind of food did they give you?</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: They gave anything nobody wanted to eat.</span> <span id="s624">They gave it to us.</span> <span id="s625">Horses.</span> <span id="s626">Dead horses.</span> <span id="s627">Q: Meat?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: Meat, yeah.</span> <span id="s629">Glad to get it.</span> <span id="s630">I was -- a lot of times I was -- I don't know if I was lucky to -- something -- I don't know.</span> <span id="s631">But we used to go up with the Germans in the woods to chop, to bring in the young trees because they needed the separation for the clothings.</span> <span id="s632">So farmers used to bring up some food there.</span> <span id="s633">So I had some money.</span> <span id="s634">I was lucky the Germans ate oranges.</span> <span id="s635">So he took the oranges from me and I got food.</span> <span id="s636">One day they took another fellow with us.</span> <span id="s637">And he brought the same thing.</span> <span id="s638">Him, he came back -- reported that him they killed.</span> <span id="s639">Because he did -- because I was sharing with him the oranges.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: The people outside of the camp must have had some idea of what was going on inside the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: Only farmers.</span> <span id="s642">Polish people.</span> <span id="s643">They did know what was going on there.</span> <span id="s644">They knew it.</span> <span id="s645">02:17:40 They knew -- they couldn't miss it because the trains go through the city.</span> <span id="s646">Trains coming in.</span> <span id="s647">They know it but I don't think anything could be done.</span> <span id="s648">Anything that maybe they would all get together and do something.</span> <span id="s649">The outsiders and insiders.</span> <span id="s650">But it was never -- see, nobody, they didn't care for us.</span> <span id="s651">Because somebody took me out.</span> <span id="s652">They took my family out after I find out.</span> <span id="s653">They went through the windows that night and they took up all our furniture.</span> <span id="s654">And everything that they find there in the house.</span> <span id="s655">They took it away.</span> <span id="s656">Everything.</span> <span id="s657">They didn't really -- they waited for those things, some of them.</span> <span id="s658">Neighbors.</span> <span id="s659">Right, neighbors next to the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: Who were, were the guards at Treblinka?</span> <span id="s661">Were they German, were they Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: Not Polish.</span> <span id="s663">Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s664">The guards, most of them, most of the guards were Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s665">Not Germans.</span> <span id="s666">Germans were the leaders.</span> <span id="s667">They give the orders.</span> <span id="s668">They would do nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: How were the Ukrainian guards?</span> <span id="s670">Did you have, did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: Oh, they were -- some was very tough, very rough.</span> <span id="s672">They were drinking all the time.</span> <span id="s673">They helped, they helped all the production there.</span> <span id="s674">Everything there was going on.</span> <span id="s675">They gave them some liquor to drink before and they just were -- no.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: Were they -- did they beat people?</span> <span id="s677">A: Some that got beaten up, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: Who were most of -- most of the prison population?</span> <span id="s679">There wasn't that large of a number there at one time, was there?</span></p> <p><span id="s680">02:19:40</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: It was all the -- was started -- then they took up some people from the people that came in.</span> <span id="s682">Took in -- the people that died off, they took in stronger people to work because -- matter of fact, we had a doctor there.</span> <span id="s683">Also came in there.</span> <span id="s684">And a lot of educated people.</span> <span id="s685">There were couples, you know.</span> <span id="s686">They did the dirty work.</span> <span id="s687">The Germans just gave the orders.</span> <span id="s688">The rest of them did the dirty work for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: I'm trying to get a sense of how many people were generally in the camp at one time.</span> <span id="s690">And the--</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: Well, most of them, at that time that I was, was about a thousand people.</span> <span id="s692">Q: And you were all working?</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: All working, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: And the other people who came in on these trains everyday?</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: The other people that came on the trains right away, they was executed.</span> <span id="s696">Right away they were killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: How many people do you think came in every day?</span> <span id="s698">Could you tell?</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: I could tell.</span> <span id="s700">I was watching.</span> <span id="s701">I was working on some -- on a roof and I was standing there and I counted the trains that came in.</span> <span id="s702">At that time was, even at the time was a Jewish holiday.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Bigger the transport was.</span> <span id="s704">Put in thousand people.</span> <span id="s705">Sometime six hundred people.</span> <span id="s706">All depends on the day, whatever they get.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: I thought I read somewhere that there were transports of sometimes up to six thousand people but they had to bring them in some at a time.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">02:21:30</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s710">The trains, was not room all the cars could come in.</span> <span id="s711">Because was not big enough to fit in all the cars.</span> <span id="s712">The rest of the -- they separated the cars.</span> <span id="s713">They left others outside, some to finish up this thing.</span> <span id="s714">And a lot of cars came in again.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: Was this pretty continual, all the time these cars came in?</span> <span id="s716">A: The most of them were every day.</span> <span id="s717">Most were every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Q: So you said you were working in a place where you could actually see what was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A: I saw what was happening.</span> <span id="s720">I wasn't, wasn't involved with taking care of those people.</span> <span id="s721">But I was involved at sometimes seeing them, going into work there.</span> <span id="s722">And I used to see them.</span> <span id="s723">I saw when I was on the roof, I saw where the trains coming in.</span> <span id="s724">Because it was not a big place.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Was not a --</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: So what else could you see?</span> <span id="s727">Could you see their arrival when they came into the courtyard?</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: Arrival that came into the courtyard, how they get undressed.</span> <span id="s729">And walk to the bath.</span> <span id="s730">And the woman they used to bring her in, take her in to cut her hair off.</span> <span id="s731">And a matter of fact, once I was working there outside, and one child, young boy, was running away with his -- got separated from his mother.</span> <span id="s732">He was running away and I saw him come in and said -- he was talking to me, I should help him.</span> <span id="s733">So I look at him, and, what can I do?</span> <span id="s734">I was afraid to even to go near him.</span> <span id="s735">And a German came over, he took him away, “Come on, I'll take you to your mother."</span></p> <p><span id="s736">02:23:32</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: What else did you see?</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: I saw people -- they would put them up on trees and shoot them like they would shoot a bird.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Saw people beaten up a for potato.</span> <span id="s740">I saw people beaten up for have -- for doing nothing.</span> <span id="s741">That's what they wanted.</span> <span id="s742">They had a dog.</span> <span id="s743">One German had a dog.</span> <span id="s744">A matter of fact, I was a witness -- consulate in Poland -- in New York.</span> <span id="s745">I was a witness for one German, they call him -- they ask me -- I ask them "What happen -- what took so long to catch him?"</span> <span id="s746">They said he came home, he change his name, he then move to a different small town and we couldn't find him.</span> <span id="s747">And finally we find him.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: Where were most of the prisoners coming from?</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: They came from Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s750">They came from Bulgaria.</span> <span id="s751">They came in -- Bulgarian people came in with passenger trains.</span> <span id="s752">Windows, everything.</span> <span id="s753">Matter of fact, they gave them barrels of water.</span> <span id="s754">They have food, the lamb, dried lamb.</span> <span id="s755">They didn't know where they were going.</span> <span id="s756">They absolutely didn't know.</span> <span id="s757">They came off the, the -- and they looked like, where are they?</span> <span id="s758">They must have -- didn't know, but, or something, not in some countries they didn't took up all of them.</span> <span id="s759">They left some people, they couldn't catch them, some of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: Why were they in passenger trains?</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: Why were they in passenger trains?</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: Because they probably didn't want the people -- the people in their country should know where they take them.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">02:25:38 That was the reason.</span> <span id="s765">That's what I figure out.</span> <span id="s766">That that's supposed to be the reason.</span> <span id="s767">Because they – Poland, they didn't care because Polish people they didn't, they agreed with them, because most -- a lot of concentration camps were all in Poland.</span> <span id="s768">Most concentration not in another country.</span> <span id="s769">They wouldn't allowed them to have this.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: Now these people who went for immediate execution.</span> <span id="s771">How many hours were they usually in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: About two hours.</span> <span id="s773">That's all.</span> <span id="s774">They just -- it was organized.</span> <span id="s775">It was working sort of like a, like a, like a factory.</span> <span id="s776">Like -- take off the clothes: One here, one here.</span> <span id="s777">They took everything separately.</span> <span id="s778">Before they had everything together.</span> <span id="s779">Then they got smart and they got everything, and they took all the clothes.</span> <span id="s780">And they told some people that work there, “Look in the pockets, look all over.”</span> <span id="s781">If they find some money, some diamonds and gold, glasses, anything you find -- they made up places where they separated everything.</span> <span id="s782">They put everything separate.</span> <span id="s783">The jackets separate.</span> <span id="s784">The clothes, the pants separate.</span> <span id="s785">The underwear separate.</span> <span id="s786">Everything separate.</span> <span id="s787">They put it separate.</span> <span id="s788">So that's, that's when I went to the woods to chop this young trees for the separation.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: When you say separation, are you talking about a building or a fence --</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: No.</span> <span id="s791">There was only building, only was separated with poles.</span> <span id="s792">Was not board up in boards, separately, but you could see through there, but there was no thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: But it was all within one building.</span> <span id="s794">Just -- 02:27:37</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: All in building.</span> <span id="s796">Big building, yeah.</span> <span id="s797">They had people working.</span> <span id="s798">People work with the glasses, people working with the diamonds.</span> <span id="s799">Gold pieces.</span> <span id="s800">That's why I got some gold pieces from the people working there.</span> <span id="s801">Because I gave them some food and they gave me some gold pieces.</span> <span id="s802">And that was the only way when I work in the concentration I had something to buy my food with.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: So you really just worked in construction but you had reason to see all of these places.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s805">I was going around all over.</span> <span id="s806">I was going around just because the work wasn't -- not in one place.</span> <span id="s807">I was -- the carpenters was in one place.</span> <span id="s808">Where they make the beds, they make the tables.</span> <span id="s809">They were in one place all the time.</span> <span id="s810">I was working outside.</span> <span id="s811">It was by the building line, you understand, and I said I had to, I had to be in a lot of places.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q: So you really had an -- a chance to see what was going on all over the camp.</span> <span id="s813">You saw them taking the clothes.</span> <span id="s814">And pulling the teeth?</span> <span id="s815">You saw this?</span></p> <p><span id="s816">A: No, I didn't see this.</span> <span id="s817">This was inside.</span> <span id="s818">They took them inside already, cutting the hair, pulling the teeth.</span> <span id="s819">This I can't tell you, because I didn't see that thing.</span> <span id="s820">Only thing I saw this: I saw at that time, one night they took us to work there, and they had bundles of clothes to put in the same trains that took the people; they put in all the clothes there.</span> <span id="s821">And they shipped them to Germany.</span> <span id="s822">And a lot of people went in hiding between the clothes and they jumped off the train on the way out.</span> <span id="s823">But they, a few of them, came twice, three times they were there because nowhere where to go.</span> <span id="s824">Most important thing a human being over any other life thing: it needs to eat.</span> <span id="s825">And the worst part was eating.</span> <span id="s826">Hiding itself was bad in the wintertime.</span> <span id="s827">The winters were heavy.</span> <span id="s828">Not like here.</span> <span id="s829">The winter's light -- it was very heavy winters.</span> <span id="s830">A lot of snow.</span> <span id="s831">This was the problem, it lasted too long.</span> <span id="s832">See, after they took out the Jews left over took about two years.</span> <span id="s833">Two years is a long time.</span> <span id="s834">Some people -- those kids were -- their feet got frozen.</span> <span id="s835">They couldn't walk; they had to shovel on their behind because they couldn't walk on their feet any more.</span> <span id="s836">And nobody wanted -- would get involved.</span> <span id="s837">I didn't blame the people, the Polish people because they find out somebody helped a Jew, they came in, they took them out, they killed them, they burned the barns, they burned the house, they burned everything.</span> <span id="s838">So they were afraid.</span> <span id="s839">I don't blame them, those people.</span> <span id="s840">I blame the people went around to show where a, where a Jew lives.</span> <span id="s841">Where you could find a Jew, for a pound of sugar.</span> <span id="s842">Those people were -- those people didn't want to help.</span> <span id="s843">Everybody was looking for his own life.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Q: We need to change tapes.</span> <span id="s845">Want your water?</span> <span id="s846">How are you doing?</span> <span id="s847">02:30:54 End of Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s849">03:00:53</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: Now a little earlier I was asking you about who was coming in on these trains, and you said from Bulgaria.</span> <span id="s851">Were whole families coming in?</span> <span id="s852">Did children --</span></p> <p><span id="s853">A: Everything.</span> <span id="s854">They took the whole families, yeah, the whole families.</span> <span id="s855">As a matter of fact, my own children came in there with parents, with my wife, first wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: Did you know they came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: I didn't know.</span> <span id="s858">I had a feeling because they took us off from work and locked us in the barracks.</span> <span id="s859">And they put machine guns on the roofs.</span> <span id="s860">So I had some feelings they were going in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q: That those people were from your town?</span> <span id="s862">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Q: Why the machine guns?</span></p> <p><span id="s864">A: Because they were afraid for us that maybe we know something about it.</span> <span id="s865">Maybe we make some riots or something.</span> <span id="s866">So they did it to protect themself.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">Q: Because that transport was from your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s868">A: From my town, yeah.</span> <span id="s869">The whole town, my wife's town.</span> <span id="s870">All small towns put together.</span> <span id="s871">And took them out of the houses.</span> <span id="s872">I heard when I came back out.</span> <span id="s873">They took farmers, horse and wagons, they put kids with a woman on the horse and wagon.</span> <span id="s874">The people were lined up.</span> <span id="s875">And they walked to the railroad.</span> <span id="s876">Was nine miles from my town to the railroad.</span> <span id="s877">And they walked to the railroad.</span> <span id="s878">And the kids was --they had to be undressed, mother used to take them, took them into the gas chamber with them together.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Q: So the children died right away.</span> <span id="s880">A: Right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">Q: Were there any young kids working in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s882">A: No.</span> <span id="s883">Only a few boys.</span> <span id="s884">Only about three of them, no kids, no kids.</span> <span id="s885">Q: Teenage boys?</span></p> <p><span id="s886">A: Not even teenagers.</span> <span id="s887">Just twelve, thirteen, fourteen, something like this.</span> <span id="s888">Q: What were they doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s889">A: They did what told them to do.</span> <span id="s890">They did take care -- clean up after the Germans.</span> <span id="s891">After they do, they take out the garbage.</span> <span id="s892">Just hang around and do a lot of things for them.</span> <span id="s893">Whatever they wanted.</span> <span id="s894">They had laundress.</span> <span id="s895">They had laundress, people work in the laundry, too.</span> <span id="s896">They had a couple woman, about three woman working the laundry and a couple men.</span> <span id="s897">Only for the Germans and Ukrainians, not for us.</span> <span id="s898">No laundry for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: Were there other women in the camp working?</span> <span id="s900">A: There were about three or four woman, that's all.</span> <span id="s901">Q: In the whole camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s902">A: Whole camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">Q: Who worked in the kitchen?</span></p> <p><span id="s904">A: They worked in the laundries, the kitchen, the kitchens.</span> <span id="s905">The woman, some Ukrainians cooked for them, the Germans cooked for them.</span> <span id="s906">They didn't trust anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">Q: Who cooked for the prisoners?</span> <span id="s908">A: We -- our people.</span> <span id="s909">Some people -- Q: Men or women?</span></p> <p><span id="s910">A: No woman, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">03:04:06</span></p> <p><span id="s912">Q: Now one thing I read about Treblinka is that for a while the organization was very bad.</span> <span id="s913">And then there was a change in the German leadership there.</span> <span id="s914">Were you there then?</span></p> <p><span id="s915">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">Q: Can you talk a little bit about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A: What it was -- the change was that they stopped a lot -- a few things.</span> <span id="s918">They send in different people -- different, more, more rougher characters.</span> <span id="s919">And they built another one, another gas chamber.</span> <span id="s920">There was Gestapo was there.</span> <span id="s921">Because they couldn't put it -- they couldn't operate.</span> <span id="s922">So many people they came in and kill them all.</span> <span id="s923">And if there no room to find to keep them alive, maybe they going to operate.</span> <span id="s924">Understand?</span> <span id="s925">So they stopped bringing in the Jews for a few weeks and they build another -- this -- and the operation started again.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">Q: What was the situation before the change in leadership?</span> <span id="s927">Were there extra bodies everywhere?</span> <span id="s928">What did --</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A: No, there was no bodies there.</span> <span id="s930">There was -- we were restless.</span> <span id="s931">They say they finished everything, they were going to kill us.</span> <span id="s932">That's what our mind was into.</span> <span id="s933">Because there was nothing if you haven't got the strength and not work.</span> <span id="s934">So we got restless.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q: Ok, so, I'm just trying to get a sense of what the camp was like before this new person, Stangl-- is that his name -- came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">03:05:38</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: The camp was there was a desert.</span> <span id="s938">It was built around a gate, all around with barbed wire.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">They had iron things standing up like this, and they put up barbed wire in case you went -- if you jump over, you get strangled up with the wire.</span> <span id="s940">You couldn't be able to get out.</span> <span id="s941">That's what they had done.</span> <span id="s942">In barracks we couldn't get -- move anywheres at night.</span> <span id="s943">At night we were locked in.</span> <span id="s944">It was, was like that chair.</span> <span id="s945">See, back and the side.</span> <span id="s946">The front was open.</span> <span id="s947">They had a gate.</span> <span id="s948">That gate was closed after we went in there.</span> <span id="s949">And the security was outside.</span> <span id="s950">So going out, outside at night was impossible.</span> <span id="s951">We couldn't done it.</span> <span id="s952">We couldn't -- anywheres.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Q: I want to ask you one other thing before we get to the uprising.</span> <span id="s954">I understand that when people came off the trains, they were very hysterical.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">A: Very disturbed.</span> <span id="s956">Very, very weak.</span> <span id="s957">They couldn't stand up on their own feet.</span> <span id="s958">You see, they had families.</span> <span id="s959">Whole families, kids.</span> <span id="s960">And the kids were crying.</span> <span id="s961">“Water, water.”</span> <span id="s962">They used to -- the mother used to urinate and give the water to, to drink for the kids.</span> <span id="s963">Such a bad situation.</span> <span id="s964">Nobody, nobody orders something like this.</span> <span id="s965">What did they -- things they didn't deserve.</span> <span id="s966">Just make a form and somebody put them on a tree and shoot them.</span> <span id="s967">Take the dog, grab a woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">Q: Were they met by the Ukrainian guards or were there Germans also in-- A: They both together.</span> <span id="s969">They both together, working together.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">03:07:45 They were always there with guns.</span> <span id="s971">Always there with guns.</span> <span id="s972">Matter of fact, one, one came off and he killed a German, some Jew stabbed him and killed him.</span> <span id="s973">And they, they said they even have a name on the -- Max Belicazan (ph.) That put it out that thing.</span> <span id="s974">Because he got killed on that, on the transport coming in.</span> <span id="s975">One Jew -- nothing to lose, see.</span> <span id="s976">I wish everybody would 5 Oberscharführer Franz Stangl have did the same thing.</span> <span id="s977">Would be -- I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">Q: Was there -- what happened after this German

<span id="s1019">They'd put them on outside and they played for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">Q: Ok, now before the uprising, were there efforts by Jews to fight back, to resist the Germans and Ukrainians?</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">03:11:17</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">A: Very little resist.</span> <span id="s1023">No such thing.</span> <span id="s1024">A matter of fact, when we started to organize ourself, the uprise, not everybody was allowed to know about it.</span> <span id="s1025">We didn't want everybody to know.</span> <span id="s1026">Until the last day, nobody know anything about it because we were frightened, because we had couples there.</span> <span id="s1027">It was German couples, was other couples, German-Jews couples.</span> <span id="s1028">And we didn't trust them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">Q: Were there -- so there were really no resistance efforts people, except for, you told me, some people would hide in the trains and try to go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">A: No resistance.</span> <span id="s1031">No resistance at all, no.</span> <span id="s1032">One fellow, they -- was standing -- every morning they used to put us in lines and counted, see everybody's there, nobody went away.</span> <span id="s1033">So the one fellow had something.</span> <span id="s1034">They took him and they put him down, they told him to take off his -- put down his pants and started to beat him up.</span> <span id="s1035">And beat him up.</span> <span id="s1036">So then they killed him.</span> <span id="s1037">Always they did something to scare us off.</span> <span id="s1038">They do something like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: So tell me about the planning for this uprising.</span> <span id="s1040">How did this come about?</span> <span id="s1041">Who knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">A: Maybe about 10, 12 people knew about it, that's all.</span> <span id="s1043">We, we were in that place where the carpenters were – worked.</span> <span id="s1044">We were sitting there, they came in the house, We were talking.</span> <span id="s1045">We had some -- we had somebody watching outside that nobody comes in.</span> <span id="s1046">And we were talking about, we're talking about it.</span> <span id="s1047">How should do it, when to do it.</span> <span id="s1048">Because at night was no problem, no such a thing that we could do at night.</span> <span id="s1049">Has to be done at daytime.</span> <span id="s1050">Because we didn't know -- they chasing people and we going to survive.</span> <span id="s1051">After they finish up, they didn't want that everybody should know something.</span> <span id="s1052">So we didn't want everybody should spoil it for us.</span> <span id="s1053">They couldn't -- talk and talk -- and then made up the time for the day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q: Now why did it have to be in the daytime?</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">A: Because we couldn't move at nighttime.</span> <span id="s1056">At nighttime we were locked in.</span> <span id="s1057">Q: And you were not in the daytime?</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">A: Hmm?</span> <span id="s1059">The daytime we were moving around, we worked there.</span> <span id="s1060">03:14:30 But not at night.</span> <span id="s1061">At night we couldn't do nothing.</span> <span id="s1062">To make this -- we got the, the ammunition and the guns.</span> <span id="s1063">Got it and they came in there.</span> <span id="s1064">They built a place where they keep their -- the guns, the Germans.</span> <span id="s1065">And they bought -- they took a door.</span> <span id="s1066">They had no key to that door.</span> <span id="s1067">And we had, what's the name -- locksmiths.</span> <span id="s1068">Locksmith, and they told him to make a key.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Q: A Jewish locksmith?</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">A: A Jewish locksmith.</span> <span id="s1071">They gave him to make a key.</span> <span id="s1072">And when he was making the key, we told him make an extra key.</span> <span id="s1073">So he make the extra key and we had that key.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">Q: Do you remember the locksmith's name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">A: No, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1076">There was so many, so many strange people there and everybody was occupied with his own tsores,see.</span> <span id="s1077">He was a goldsmith, a guy who was making rings, also.</span> <span id="s1078">We told him, make a key.</span> <span id="s1079">Extra key.</span> <span id="s1080">And we took the key, and we were hiding that key.</span> <span id="s1081">And we started to talk about the uprise.</span> <span id="s1082">We gave the key to these kids, the same kids we were working by the Germans, the goyim,to go into the [inaudible].</span> <span id="s1083">We told them, we warned, because when the Germans finished eating, everything was empty there.</span> <span id="s1084">Nobody was there.</span> <span id="s1085">So they had opportunity to get into the magazine.</span> <span id="s1086">The same baby carriages for the garbage, they put in the guns on the bottom.</span> <span id="s1087">It was the carpenter’s place, them hiding there.</span> <span id="s1088">It was -- dig the hole and put it in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">Q: I just need to -- I need to ask you this because I want to make sure for the record this is very clear.</span> <span id="s1090">So the baby carriages were from the trains, but they had to take them to the garbage and they hid the guns in them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">6 Hardship, misery (Yiddish).</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">7 Gentiles (Yiddish).</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">Q: Ok.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">A: And that's -- had watches.</span> <span id="s1096">Had a watch, everybody put up the time.</span> <span id="s1097">The time this should happen was supposed to be about five o'clock, before everybody comes in.</span> <span id="s1098">So we get a few people -- not all the boys know about it, but a few went out to work with -- we could trust them.</span> <span id="s1099">So after this somebody find out and everybody have a little money hidden away from the dead people.</span> <span id="s1100">They put it in this -- the one boy came home and started to dig up the money.</span> <span id="s1101">And a couple, a Jewish couple, saw him and called out a German.</span> <span id="s1102">And the German started to run to grab that boy.</span> <span id="s1103">He grab him, he going to beat him up and he was going to tell what's going on.</span> <span id="s1104">Then we decided -- we made it before.</span> <span id="s1105">We made it a half an hour before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">03:17:55 So a lot of people started to run.</span> <span id="s1107">Everybody was running.</span> <span id="s1108">Only they didn't know where to run.</span> <span id="s1109">They didn't -- they were running front and back at the same place because the direction -- they were running, they didn't -- a lot of them strange people, not from even Poland, from different countries.</span> <span id="s1110">When I was, my town was from the concentration camp was 15 miles only.</span> <span id="s1111">I don't know the directions, I know where I walking.</span> <span id="s1112">And I started to run.</span> <span id="s1113">I didn't hear the gun that time.</span> <span id="s1114">I had -- I took some big -- a handle from a chopper -- a big heavy -- and I came -- I was running back and I came to the people inside that was standing there and I say "Come, what are you staying here for?</span> <span id="s1115">Come on, let's run."</span> <span id="s1116">They weren't running.</span> <span id="s1117">They weren't running.</span> <span id="s1118">They staying there.</span> <span id="s1119">They didn't want to run.</span> <span id="s1120">I was running.</span> <span id="s1121">I wanted there to find another person.</span> <span id="s1122">And I came in -- came to the front of my town, it was daytime.</span> <span id="s1123">I couldn't go into the town, because I was afraid to.</span> <span id="s1124">I laid down there until it got dark.</span> <span id="s1125">And I went back way, not in the front, through the whole town.</span> <span id="s1126">To the side.</span> <span id="s1127">And I went into farmer and I wanted some water.</span> <span id="s1128">So he didn't want to give me no water.</span> <span id="s1129">The farmer had no -- he's afraid, he expects somebody to come to him, he don't want to give him no water.</span> <span id="s1130">I went away from him.</span> <span id="s1131">I went to the different farmer.</span> <span id="s1132">That farmer would give me water because he knows a lot of Jews, a couple Jews was hiding somewhere else, and he supplied them with food.</span> <span id="s1133">So he would give me water.</span> <span id="s1134">He would probably push me, put me back with the other ones.</span> <span id="s1135">But I was running and then I laid down because I was tired, nighttime, in the field.</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">03:20:02 Laid for a while and after a while I got up and I look around and I didn't know where I am.</span> <span id="s1137">My mind disappeared.</span> <span id="s1138">Are they running?</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">Q: Were you alone?</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">A: No, another man.</span> <span id="s1141">That one who lives, lives in Brooklyn -- in Miami, yeah.</span> <span id="s1142">That's the guy.</span> <span id="s1143">I was -- got up and I find out he didn't know where he was going because he's not from -- he's from different town.</span> <span id="s1144">He was following me.</span> <span id="s1145">He didn't -- yeah, he watched me like a hawk.</span> <span id="s1146">He couldn't let me go because if I go, he is lost.</span> <span id="s1147">I went into the woods, finally got into the woods.</span> <span id="s1148">And started to get daylight.</span> <span id="s1149">And I see farmers coming into work, and I know them the farmers.</span> <span id="s1150">And I was afraid to go up.</span> <span id="s1151">I wouldn't go up.</span> <span id="s1152">But it comes 12 o'clock and the farmers would go home.</span> <span id="s1153">Lunch time.</span> <span id="s1154">And I go out and can take a look around.</span> <span id="s1155">I find another couple.</span> <span id="s1156">A boy, a young boy with a sister-in-law.</span> <span id="s1157">A sister, the husband got killed and he -- and they was scared for me and I was scared for them.</span> <span id="s1158">Finally, we got together.</span> <span id="s1159">Got together and they were -- the farmers didn't want to sell them anything, because they didn't have no money.</span> <span id="s1160">They didn't want to give them anything.</span> <span id="s1161">They didn't have no money.</span> <span id="s1162">That boy used to go in at night, to the farmers, and what they put up for the dogs to eat, he used to take it away.</span> <span id="s1163">The food, with a stick, for the dogs, and they lived on it.</span> <span id="s1164">Then we came there and I had some gold pieces and I gave them this gold piece and they went to the farmer and they got everything.</span> <span id="s1165">At night, not in daytime.</span> <span id="s1166">We got everything.</span> <span id="s1167">Finally, we came, we got food to eat.</span> <span id="s1168">How we going to live?</span> <span id="s1169">And after the -- we started steal a shovel from the farmer, came into the woods and I dig a hole.</span> <span id="s1170">I dig the hole, made a place for four people.</span> <span id="s1171">In the place -- and I covered it up.</span> <span id="s1172">I chopped up some pieces wood to cover the top.</span> <span id="s1173">And straw.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">And I put the dirt.</span> <span id="s1175">The same dirt what was the other side, they shouldn't recognize that something new build there.</span> <span id="s1176">The dirt was thrown away somewhere far away.</span> <span id="s1177">There should be no dirt and we laid there.</span> <span id="s1178">At night, I used to go for food.</span> <span id="s1179">And sometimes I used to take -- was a lake there -- used to go into the lake and wash us off.</span> <span id="s1180">Couldn't -- not to wipe us off, to washing off.</span> <span id="s1181">And that's where we lived for a couple months.</span> <span id="s1182">For 11 months we were living like this.</span> <span id="s1183">After 11 months, they started to burn around there.</span> <span id="s1184">They almost started -- the Russians coming to chase the Germans.</span> <span id="s1185">And the Germans started to burn around all of there and I went away to different place.</span> <span id="s1186">And I was laying in different place before -- the guns from both sides.</span> <span id="s1187">And I see the Germans digging in.</span> <span id="s1188">And I was separated from the group.</span> <span id="s1189">I was by myself.</span> <span id="s1190">And I was going to look for them.</span> <span id="s1191">Finally, the German caught me.</span> <span id="s1192">The German did.</span> <span id="s1193">And this Germans didn't know I was Jewish because, I think they didn't know too much what's going on, either.</span> <span id="s1194">The army people.</span> <span id="s1195">So they caught me.</span> <span id="s1196">And they said I was a spy.</span> <span id="s1197">He was talking German but I'm Jewish, I understand a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">03:24:29 He took me in on the wagon and, “Come with us.”</span> <span id="s1199">I went with him.</span> <span id="s1200">And on the way going, was a telephone.</span> <span id="s1201">The field telephones, you know.</span> <span id="s1202">He takes up a shovel, told me to dig.</span> <span id="s1203">And so he told me to dig a grave for me.</span> <span id="s1204">He told me -- he showed me what he wants.</span> <span id="s1205">To cover up the cables.</span> <span id="s1206">And he took me into the -- with the leaders, standing in a room there in the farm.</span> <span id="s1207">And he told -- just got somebody there.</span> <span id="s1208">Told me to go lay down.</span> <span id="s1209">I came there in there -- a lot of farmers laying in there.</span> <span id="s1210">People were known.</span> <span id="s1211">And I was afraid for them, too.</span> <span id="s1212">It was nighttime.</span> <span id="s1213">They told us to lay down.</span> <span id="s1214">They were laying down.</span> <span id="s1215">And I couldn't sleep.</span> <span id="s1216">They was -- they fall asleep.</span> <span id="s1217">And I was trying to go out.</span> <span id="s1218">I went into the side and made believe I have to make -- and the Germans comes up, I went away.</span> <span id="s1219">And I tried to go through the barns.</span> <span id="s1220">Some of farmers had two doors.</span> <span id="s1221">One that used to come in horse and wagon.</span> <span id="s1222">They should be one way out and one way out.</span> <span id="s1223">So I was trying to get in through the -- some of them had ceilings and I couldn't go through the ceilings.</span> <span id="s1224">So finally I went into that barn, was two doors.</span> <span id="s1225">I opened the back door.</span> <span id="s1226">In that barn was horses.</span> <span id="s1227">They started to run and they made noise.</span> <span id="s1228">Was that time when they take off the grain from the fields.</span> <span id="s1229">They have straw.</span> <span id="s1230">They have to put them up on the field to dry.</span> <span id="s1231">I was hiding there.</span> <span id="s1232">And I was hiding there 'til it got quiet.</span> <span id="s1233">And I started to run.</span> <span id="s1234">I was running, running, running.</span> <span id="s1235">Finally, I came to -- it got daytime.</span> <span id="s1236">And I was laying, all around, surrounded me Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">03:26:46 What could I do?</span> <span id="s1238">I can't lay here.</span> <span id="s1239">I picked myself up.</span> <span id="s1240">I started to walk.</span> <span id="s1241">And I walked and the one German comes over to me, told me, showed me to cut grass.</span> <span id="s1242">I can't cut.</span> <span id="s1243">I told him I am not a farmer.</span> <span id="s1244">They let me go.</span> <span id="s1245">I went -- I met one farmer, he said "Come with me."</span> <span id="s1246">He was running away also from his home because of the shooting, and fire, burning.</span> <span id="s1247">He took me with him.</span> <span id="s1248">He said "Come with me.</span> <span id="s1249">I got food and we're going to eat."</span> <span id="s1250">He took me into the woods and I was laying in the woods and was organization -- they call it Akowcy.They used to kill -- they didn't like Germans.</span> <span id="s1251">They didn't like Jews.</span> <span id="s1252">They didn't like the Russians, either.</span> <span id="s1253">And I was laying there.</span> <span id="s1254">They came around and looked at me.</span> <span id="s1255">Somebody let them know -- they looked at me.</span> <span id="s1256">Soon they walked away from me, I walked away to a different place.</span> <span id="s1257">I was hiding somewhere else.</span> <span id="s1258">I didn't trust them, either.</span> <span id="s1259">I was laying for a day there, and finally the Russians came in.</span> <span id="s1260">The Russians came in but -- the Russians came in and I went to my town.</span> <span id="s1261">I came to the town --</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">Q: When was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">A: This was -- got to be in -- July, August, something like this, because that time everything was on the field yet.</span> <span id="s1264">About August, something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">Q: In '44.</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">A: '44.</span> <span id="s1267">And I came into the town.</span> <span

them scared, because they were living in my house, my parent's house, and everything.</span> <span id="s1272">And they were afraid I was going to start on them.</span> <span id="s1273">So it was a foolish thing for me to do anything like this, because what I going to do all by myself?</span> <span id="s1274">Start up with them now?</span> <span id="s1275">So I disappeared, I went away.</span> <span id="s1276">I didn't want to stay in there too long.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">03:29:17 I went away to a farm.</span> <span id="s1278">The farmer came into him he came in to eat.</span> <span id="s1279">He gave me this, and he said, "At night, I want to sleep, go to sleep and don't tell me where you going to sleep."</span> <span id="s1280">And he was afraid somebody come in – “Don't tell me where you go.”</span> <span id="s1281">He was a real honest, good man, he saved about ten Jews.</span> <span id="s1282">Not by him hiding, by him.</span> <span id="s1283">They build themself

me about this farmer who saved some Jewish people and you hid there, and he said, "Don't tell me where you're going."</span> <span id="s1295">What happened next?</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">A: Well, after a while I slept over there.</span> <span id="s1297">I went up to -- well, I took chances.</span> <span id="s1298">There was nobody there, nobody.</span> <span id="s1299">No punishment.</span> <span id="s1300">Everybody did something without firing up a lot of people.</span> <span id="s1301">The Germans surrounded the Jews, and they were interested nobody should know about it.</span> <span id="s1302">But a lot of people, a lot of Polacks told me who was there, and I was afraid for them, too, because there was a lot of people they -- one is to be a owned a lot of property there in all the good.</span> <span id="s1303">He took me in, he gave me to eat.</span> <span id="s1304">The other although I couldn't; I did not.</span> <span id="s1305">One fellow, he did a lot of harm to Jews, found a lot of Jews.</span> <span id="s1306">Once he came over to me, and he took me in and he took me in a corner and he said, "See, I got a gun.</span> <span id="s1307">If I could kill you, nobody would do anything to me."</span> <span id="s1308">So why did he want to do those things?</span> <span id="s1309">"I'm not doing anything to anybody, and I'm not doing anything."</span> <span id="s1310">He said, "Let me go in," and we were living, then, after a while, the other people came out, the Jews who survived the also from my town.</span> <span id="s1311">And he took away their house, took away all two rooms on the farms, the Polacks that were living there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">Q: But you're back in your town now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">A: We're back in the town.</span> <span id="s1314">We were living there for a couple weeks with a border guard, a Russian soldier.</span> <span id="s1315">You know, we had put shutters on the windows and closed the shutters at night.</span> <span id="s1316">And I had a gun at the time, under the pillow.</span> <span id="s1317">After a while we went in other states and other cities.</span> <span id="s1318">They came in at night and took all the Jews to kill more, whatever the survivors that was there after the war, after this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">Q: Who was killing, doing the killing now?</span> <span id="s1320">A: The Polack.</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">Q: After the Russians came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">A: After the Russians came in.</span> <span id="s1323">They took up and one town it was called Kossow.</span> <span id="s1324">They came in at night.</span> <span id="s1325">There was seven people living in one apartment.</span> <span id="s1326">They came in and took them out, and I never saw them again.</span> <span id="s1327">I never heard from them again.</span> <span id="s1328">They killed them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">Q: So even after the Russians had liberated this area, the Poles were still killing Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">A: They couldn't live in our town.</span> <span id="s1331">They have to move away from my town.</span> <span id="s1332">I went to a town was about 80 miles away.</span> <span id="s1333">You know, we stayed there in that town, and after another day or so, we went away to a big town, Lódz.</span> <span id="s1334">I was there for a while.</span> <span id="s1335">There was no future for the Jews.</span> <span id="s1336">I didn't want to stay in that country anymore.</span> <span id="s1337">From there, I went to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1338">When I came to Czechoslovakia, there were standing, there, over there, so many people there, there was no room, no food or nothing.</span> <span id="s1339">From there, I went through the border at night to Germans.</span> <span id="s1340">The American people, American soldier didn't let us go through.</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">04:04:50 At night, we went through the gates because I was watching the spotlights.</span> <span id="s1342">They weren't on at the border.</span> <span id="s1343">We came to Germany to the first city that connected to Poland.</span> <span id="s1344">And we were there--</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">Q: What was that city?</span> <span id="s1346">A: Terezpol (ph)</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">Q: Terezpol.</span> <span id="s1348">Do you remember about the date we're talking about now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">A: I don't know, I can't tell -- it was summertime, I know for sure, because there was no way cold weather.</span> <span id="s1350">Yeah, it was cold!</span> <span id="s1351">It was winter, it was wintertime, because everything was frozen there.</span> <span id="s1352">Even the bathrooms there, we couldn't use it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">Q: So was this maybe early 1945?</span> <span id="s1354">A: '44.</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">Q: '44?</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">Q: The end of '44?</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">A: End of '44, yeah.</span> <span id="s1359">End of '44, because we got -- '44 it was, because when we got alone, I mean, '45, '44, because '45 was in Germany.</span> <span id="s1360">We came to Germany and for a while we were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">Q: But the war wasn't over yet.</span> <span id="s1362">A: The war was over in '44.</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">Q: '45. '</span> <span id="s1364">45, I think.</span> <span id="s1365">I think was -- I don't know, it was . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">Q: Yeah, I think Lódz was liquidated in August of '44.</span> <span id="s1367">I don't think the war was over until spring of '45.</span> <span id="s1368">We'll worry about that later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">Q: I'll let you continue.</span> <span id="s1371">So you went into Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">A: We were there, then when Germany came, we went to the DP camp.</span> <span id="s1373">We were living there, also, three families in one room.</span> <span id="s1374">Four, at that time it was, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">Q: Four?</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">A: Four families in our room.</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">Q: Who were you with at this point?</span> <span id="s1378">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">Q: Who were you with now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">A: I got married to Norma after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">Q: Oh, I missed that detail.</span> <span id="s1382">Where did you meet your wife?</span> <span id="s1383">A: I met my wife in '44.</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">Q: What town?</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">A: Vengrov.</span> <span id="s1386">When I went away from my town, I was there.</span> <span id="s1387">04:07:25</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">Q: Ok, right, ok.</span> <span id="s1389">So you met your wife in 1944 in Vengrov and you were traveling with her?</span> <span id="s1390">A: Yeah, in Germany, she got sick on the way.</span> <span id="s1391">We came to Germany, she went to the hospital.</span> <span id="s1392">Q: So what was the name of the DP camp you were in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">A: Föhrenwald.</span> <span id="s1394">And the first couple of months I was Kirshenreid (ph), was probably, they took away a couple of houses from the Germans and they gave us their quarters there to sleep in for a while.</span> <span id="s1395">After a while, they had nobody there, and I found out the same friend we were with in one concentration camp, he lives in Föhrenwald, so I went there.</span> <span id="s1396">There was a DP camp there, so I lived in there for a year or a little more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">Q: It was difficult there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">A: It was a lot of monkey business going on.</span> <span id="s1399">It was plenty of food supply from -- the UNRRA supplied a lot of food.</span> <span id="s1400">A lot of food, a lot of people that took the food that sold it on black market.</span> <span id="s1401">And they didn't -- they gave us anything that cooked that made out of -- like soup so they put in more water.</span> <span id="s1402">Instead of putting in some more nourishment, they put in more water.</span> <span id="s1403">They sold the stuff.</span> <span id="s1404">Sold the stuff to somebody else.</span> <span id="s1405">They made a lot of money.</span> <span id="s1406">A lot of it going on, Jews alone.</span> <span id="s1407">And I was surprised to hear about it, to see about it because the same people were almost dead already, they could take advantage on us.</span> <span id="s1408">Yet, this -- you have to stay in line for everything, to come on in.</span> <span id="s1409">They didn't let you do anything.</span> <span id="s1410">You couldn't sell anything.</span> <span id="s1411">You couldn't do it, because they, the UNRRA, even wouldn't allow a citizen to sell to any business.</span> <span id="s1412">What was going on, business there, they were bringing bowls or steal them there and they were selling them.</span> <span id="s1413">They got the money.</span> <span id="s1414">We didn't have the money.</span> <span id="s1415">I didn't work after they had the money, so I had to live from food that they gave me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">Q: So you were there about a year?</span> <span id="s1417">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">Q: You were there about one year?</span> <span id="s1419">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">Q: In the camp in Föhrenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">A: More there -- I came in 1947, it was 1946, '47, we came in April of 1947 to the United States.</span> <span id="s1422">I was there until that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">Q: Was it difficult to get a visa to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">A: Well, the visa, I didn't get the visa because she had a sister, my wife, and I found out -- we found out, the address.</span> <span id="s1425">We had a soldier, an American soldier came in and we were talking to him.</span> <span id="s1426">So he put it in the paper, and they were looking.</span> <span id="s1427">She gave the name.</span> <span id="s1428">My wife gave the name of the sister, the name, the family name.</span> <span id="s1429">And they were looking up, and she looked -- the other sister had a friend.</span> <span id="s1430">Francis' (ph) son was in the army in Germany.</span> <span id="s1431">He was in the army in Germany, so she located him.</span> <span id="s1432">She told him, so he came to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">04:11:05 9 United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration He looked us up, and he came to us.</span> <span id="s1434">We started talks with him and finally he located us and the sister, sent us a letter and even sent us some money.</span> <span id="s1435">So it was a little better at that time we had to buy some food, the money.</span> <span id="s1436">And then we began to get registered to go to the United States.</span> <span id="s1437">And her sister, she send me the papers, her sister she sent me the papers, and we came to the Unites States in 1947.</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">Q: Now, when you were in the DP camp, were you allowed to come and go as much as you wanted?</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">A: Yeah, well, a lot to go far back.</span> <span id="s1440">We wasn't allowed to do any business.</span> <span id="s1441">Q: Why wouldn't they let you do business?</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">A: Because this was a law from UNRRA.</span> <span id="s1443">We were not supposed to do it, because they give you to eat.</span> <span id="s1444">It was, they used to take in, they used to send in a lot of cigarettes.</span> <span id="s1445">They gave to the people.</span> <span id="s1446">The cigarettes never they gave it to the people.</span> <span id="s1447">They made a flyer, they said this, the cigarettes was sold already.</span> <span id="s1448">They made a flyer, and they said it was burnt, it got burnt.</span> <span id="s1449">They didn't have cartons left over.</span> <span id="s1450">It was a lot of things going on.</span> <span id="s1451">There's was a lot -- then the very rich came here; they bought property and hotels out of somebody else's tragedies.</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">Q: I want to just for a minute, ask you a few more questions about the Treblinka uprising, because this is very important to know about.</span> <span id="s1453">Well, you told me that when you were organizing there, were maybe only a dozen people or so.</span> <span id="s1454">But at the time of the uprising, were more people involved?</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">04:13:08</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">A: Well, everybody was involved at that time, really, because we started to shooting -- most of the war.</span> <span id="s1457">They couldn't, they didn't know where, how to handle themselves, how to take advantage.</span> <span id="s1458">Of course, the things that went out from there was not so hot, that went out of there.</span> <span id="s1459">But to stay alive, that was the hardest thing to do, because that time was -- if they needed, they were afraid to trust anybody.</span> <span id="s1460">They were afraid to knock on farmers’ door, but you didn’t know their priorities.</span> <span id="s1461">Sometimes they could take, they took in a lot of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">They took then their money; they killed them.</span> <span id="s1463">You see, that's what they did, a lot of them.</span> <span id="s1464">They said, "Come in, come in, come in."</span> <span id="s1465">And that night, they took them, they killed them.</span> <span id="s1466">They took away their money, and they buried you somewhere, wherever they wanted to do, you see.</span> <span id="s1467">There was a lot of people disappeared.</span> <span id="s1468">We didn't know where they had disappeared, but there were several at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">Q: So there people from all the different parts of Treblinka who got involved at the end, during the uprising?</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">A: Not too many, as I tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">Q: A couple hundred people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s1473">But at that time there was almost a thousand people in that camp yet.</span> <span id="s1474">Q: And they all got involved in the uprising?</span></p> <p><span id="s1475">A: I don't know, this I cannot tell if they were involved.</span> <span id="s1476">I know where -- I saw a lot of people running.</span> <span id="s1477">A lot of people -- but they, they weren't successful.</span> <span id="s1478">They weren't successful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">Q: How were you able to communicate to prisoners in other parts of the camp, in the upper camp, for example?</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">A: The other camp didn't communicate, no communication at all with others except separately.</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">They worked by the dead people.</span> <span id="s1482">With that people there were no communications at all.</span> <span id="s1483">They didn't have any communication.</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">Q: Did they know about the uprising?</span> <span id="s1485">A: I cannot say about it at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">Q: You told me you set this time, 4 o'clock, 5 o'clock, whenever, and you had to let everybody know that this was the time.</span> <span id="s1487">Were you able to get word to different parts of the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">A: Well, we had to get word, the words was given before we went out to work.</span> <span id="s1489">They give them the words.</span> <span id="s1490">And before they went out to work, they gave them the -- told them at that time they wanted this.</span> <span id="s1491">“Do it.”</span> <span id="s1492">That's the only communication they got.</span> <span id="s1493">After they went out to work, each group went a different direction, you know.</span> <span id="s1494">Then we couldn't communicate with them anymore.</span> <span id="s1495">We couldn't even know -- like myself, when I was running, a lot of people were running in different directions over there.</span> <span id="s1496">Some of them, most of them were going different directions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">Q: Right, but when people go out to work, they went to different places in the camp so they could then tell people in other places, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">Q: Even the people who worked in the upper camp, did they sleep in the same place as you?</span> <span id="s1500">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">Q: So you all slept in the same place.</span> <span id="s1502">A: We all slept in the same place, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">Q: So you could communicate then?</span> <span id="s1504">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">Q: So, okay.</span> <span id="s1506">I think I understand it.</span> <span id="s1507">04:16:25</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">A: Well, see, everybody -- somebody met somebody from each group for them to work, one person to two people, they know it.</span> <span id="s1509">You see, they are supposed to let know the rest of the group, you see.</span> <span id="s1510">They couldn't give everybody the time.</span> <span id="s1511">They gave it to only a few people each whenever they -- the leader or something, them, this or that is the time.</span> <span id="s1512">The rest of the people couldn't know because there's too much, too much of a risk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">Q: I guess this is what I didn't understand before.</span> <span id="s1514">Even though you had no communication during the workday with people --</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">A: At night we all came to the same place.</span> <span id="s1516">The same kitchen, and we ate together.</span> <span id="s1517">They were at the table or underneath or something like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">Q: Then that was also a way that you could learn what was happening in other parts of the camp, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">Q: So you were one of the leaders?</span> <span id="s1521">A: I was trusted from them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">Q: And why at this point -- because at other times you said, "You know, there's no hope.</span> <span id="s1523">They'll kill us."</span> <span id="s1524">Why at this point did you decide to take the risk?</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">A: Well, there's no risk.</span> <span id="s1526">Was no risk; I was dead anyway.</span> <span id="s1527">What have I got to risk?</span> <span id="s1528">I didn't risk nothing.</span> <span id="s1529">There was no risk involved, see.</span> <span id="s1530">I was running away, and I wouldn't want to survive, was a risk.</span> <span id="s1531">But running away, at that time was no risk at all because I was a dead person anyway.</span> <span id="s1532">This, dead sentence because I was a Jew.</span> <span id="s1533">That's all that it is.</span> <span id="s1534">I did at that time have no choice.</span> <span id="s1535">There was no risk at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">Q: Do you think that you got any implicit help from non-Jews at the camp, I mean, that maybe they looked the other way, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">A: That's what we were waiting for.</span> <span id="s1538">When we were waiting, sometimes maybe somebody, maybe somebody will come do some bomb, do something.</span> <span id="s1539">Of course, they had opportunity.</span> <span id="s1540">They were strong, they had the tools, they had ratchets, and they had everything.</span> <span id="s1541">They could have done, they didn't do.</span> <span id="s1542">The Germans were so scared themselves, and one started to run and one was standing with a gun in his hand and he couldn't shoot.</span> <span id="s1543">He was shaking like this [indicating no].</span> <span id="s1544">They were so scared like that.</span> <span id="s1545">They couldn't, they couldn't --</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">Q: Well, the day -- I read that on the day of the uprising, it was a hot day, that it was a Sunday or Monday?</span></p> <p><span id="s1547">A: I can't remember the date when it come at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">Q: And that everybody, all the Ukrainian guards, were down at the river swimming and getting drunk?</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">A: No, there was no place there to swim.</span> <span id="s1550">They're not near the water to swim there.</span> <span id="s1551">They are nowhere near, this is nothing there.</span> <span id="s1552">It is just unbelievable that -- I cannot say, because it was a desert.</span> <span id="s1553">There was no water.</span> <span id="s1554">Even the ditches are so deep there to get water.</span> <span id="s1555">They gave us to eat potatoes not washed even, with the dirt.</span> <span id="s1556">When I used to eat my potato when I came in the beginning and the lots of people were there, I still got the peels from the potato.</span> <span id="s1557">And they picked it up in the dirt on the ground, and they ate it.</span> <span id="s1558">That's a step that I didn't -- I couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s1559">I couldn't say it then, because I wasn't hungry at that time yet.</span> <span id="s1560">Or what they did like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">Q: Do you remember a Mr. Bloch?</span> <span id="s1562">Do you remember an SS officer by the name of Kuttner?</span> <span id="s1563">04:20:27</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">A: SS officer?</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">Q: Kuttner?</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">A: What's the name?</span> <span id="s1567">Keloa, Keloa (ph)?</span> <span id="s1568">Another one was, what's the name, Lakla (ph)?</span> <span id="s1569">We call him Lakla, a nice young fellow, big fellow.</span> <span id="s1570">That was the court that I was a witness for at that time frame.</span> <span id="s1571">This Keloa-- of course, nobody has the same name, real name.</span> <span id="s1572">Didn't call them by the real name because we make the different name because they shouldn't know what we're talking about.</span> <span id="s1573">You see, that's what I mean, change the name to another name.</span> <span id="s1574">I know it and that second fellow know it over there, but the German didn't know then we call it when we mention his name.</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">Q: Did you know -- I can't pronounce this right, but was there a Dr. Chorazycki?</span> <span id="s1576">You don't know that name?</span> <span id="s1577">You don't know people's names, different.</span> <span id="s1578">I understand.</span> <span id="s1579">I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1580">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">Q: When you were running out of the camp, did you see it burning yet, or was it not yet?</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">A: It was not burning yet.</span> <span id="s1583">It was started to burn because when they started that thing was people, some people work there, disinfect us they used to call it.</span> <span id="s1584">They disinfected the clothing, the places there, the clothes; the Germans did this.</span> <span id="s1585">That day we found out that they have some gasoline.</span> <span id="s1586">Instead of putting in disinfection, we told them to put in the gasoline inside in the tanks.</span> <span id="s1587">They set it go around, spraying with that thing with the disinfection, they spray it with this.</span> <span id="s1588">It wasn't so easy to catch on fire because we didn't have too many matches to spare.</span> <span id="s1589">So we had it burning there.</span> <span id="s1590">After -- I was running, I see it burning, in fact, one German got killed.</span> <span id="s1591">I didn't look back, didn't want to look back because I was running.</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">Q: So they were going to use the gasoline or the kerosene to maybe be a distraction, or to start burning the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">A: Burning the camp.</span> <span id="s1594">Started slowly, yeah.</span> <span id="s1595">We were burning the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">Q: So the plan was just that at five o'clock everybody was going to run?</span> <span id="s1597">That was the whole plan?</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">04:23:03</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">Q: That no one was going to shoot.</span> <span id="s1601">They were just going to run out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">A: Well, say, in this cases, see, none of them took any risk of anything because you or your people were caged like a tiger or some sort of other animals.</span> <span id="s1603">You don't -- any chance you have, you want to jump at another day because there's not another chance.</span> <span id="s1604">You didn't, no risk involved.</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">Q: But what I'm trying to understand is the whole plan was that at a certain time everybody was just going to storm the gates, basically.</span> <span id="s1606">You weren't going to meet; you were just all going to run out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">A: No, but we didn't storm the gates.</span> <span id="s1608">Everybody was outside the gates.</span> <span id="s1609">They were working outside the gates, not inside.</span> <span id="s1610">Most of the people like me, I was inside the gate because our shops were inside the gate.</span> <span id="s1611">The shoemaker was inside his gate.</span> <span id="s1612">The locksmith was inside the gate.</span> <span id="s1613">The rest of the people worked at different places outside the gates, under the supervision of Ukrainians or Germans.</span> <span id="s1614">We were inside the gates, working.</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">Q: So the plan then only was that at a certain time wherever you were, you left?</span> <span id="s1616">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">Q: Was there anything else that you had planned on doing in order to make this successful?</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">A: Nothing, no other plan could we do.</span> <span id="s1619">The best plan we had was to just run away from -- they were outside the gate and everyone could run.</span> <span id="s1620">But the only way of this would be we were all together, and we couldn't stay all together.</span> <span id="s1621">We couldn't -- even we could keep ourselves together, it was a very big risk to stay ourselves together, because we could be caught.</span> <span id="s1622">As a matter of fact, a day after I was running away, I was afraid to stay somewhere, I was in the fields.</span> <span id="s1623">Not even the farms, because I was afraid they going to come and look all over for us.</span> <span id="s1624">So I was not able to live with this risk.</span> <span id="s1625">So this was no -- any risk was nothing.</span> <span id="s1626">Only we couldn't help each other.</span> <span id="s1627">Everybody was solo there.</span> <span id="s1628">Everybody was saying they couldn't.</span> <span id="s1629">I couldn't have helped anybody if I had no way, I can't help myself.</span> <span id="s1630">I can't help it, though.</span></p> <p><span id="s1631">Q: I'm just trying to visualize what the guards were doing, as everybody started running.</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">A: They was shaking.</span> <span id="s1633">I saw -- like I told you before.</span> <span id="s1634">One general was standing with a gun; he couldn't shoot.</span> <span id="s1635">He was shaking.</span> <span id="s1636">He was afraid.</span> <span id="s1637">They only were not afraid when they had the gun above us.</span> <span id="s1638">When they started to -- we could have -- didn't have to run nowhere and burn, they all think and kill them all of the Germans, but we had the courage, see.</span> <span id="s1639">The resistance was so low, but this was a desperate people, they were afraid to do anything.</span> <span id="s1640">And another thing, as a matter of fact, the Germans used go around, "When you going run?</span> <span id="s1641">You going to run now?</span> <span id="s1642">Where you going to run?</span> <span id="s1643">Where will you go?</span> <span id="s1644">You have nowhere left to go."</span> <span id="s1645">This is a safe place, you stay there...that's what they tell me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">04:26:46</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">Q: When you think about this now, many years later, what comes to mind?</span> <span id="s1648">What images are you stuck with?</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">A: The image I'm stuck with, the people around the whole world how did they let it happen like this?</span> <span id="s1650">The United States knowing about it.</span> <span id="s1651">The Arab countries know.</span> <span id="s1652">England knowing about because they had spies all over.</span> <span id="s1653">They told them everything.</span> <span id="s1654">Why did they wait until they killed off six million?</span> <span id="s1655">Why they didn't do this before?</span> <span id="s1656">Why they didn't do -- they could have done something to spoil the whole thing.</span> <span id="s1657">But then nobody did anything, nobody wanted to do anything.</span> <span id="s1658">Because it was only Jews involved, not -- but they didn't know how many other nations got killed, also.</span> <span id="s1659">The Czechoslovakian, Polish, all the country.</span> <span id="s1660">Anybody said anything to them, they killed them.</span> <span id="s1661">Even Gypsies, what did the Gypsies do, didn't set a, you know, set a trap for the German people.</span> <span id="s1662">They didn't do that.</span> <span id="s1663">They put them in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1664">I saw them coming in.</span> <span id="s1665">They came in with -- they were looking around.</span> <span id="s1666">They didn't know what's happened to them, Gypsies.</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">Q: How do you think that you were able to get through all of this?</span> <span id="s1668">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">Q: How do you think that you were personally were able to get through this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">04:28:28</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">A: Personally, I wanted to see what -- either it's going to happen, after everything is over, I want to see.</span> <span id="s1672">Everything I was fighting for, I want to see what they were going to do to the German people, what they were doing to the other people.</span> <span id="s1673">All the other people, like the -- what's the name, the Arabs.</span> <span id="s1674">They helped the Germans.</span> <span id="s1675">The other thing I wanted to see somebody that's a friend of theirs, everything was -- I was so much disappointed after everything was over.</span> <span id="s1676">I looked and then what did it do to Germany?</span> <span id="s1677">They got a few people, they gave them a trial, few people.</span> <span id="s1678">The most of them, they knew all of this came in.</span> <span id="s1679">Well, clothing came into Germany that didn't know, didn't ask no questions from where it comes?</span> <span id="s1680">A lot of everything was getting, the gold, the Germans take a vacation.</span> <span id="s1681">Sent satchels full of gold and diamonds to Germany every couple of months to get it away.</span> <span id="s1682">The Germans didn't get nothing from anybody, from the Jews.</span> <span id="s1683">Half a million Jews got killed in Treblinka.</span> <span id="s1684">So everybody had something, a chain or earrings or anything.</span> <span id="s1685">They know, but they didn't -- everybody kept quiet at the size clothes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1686">04:30:00 End of Tape #4 Conclusion of Interview</span></p></body></html>
