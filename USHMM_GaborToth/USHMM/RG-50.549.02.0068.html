id="s14">My name is Neenah Ellis.</span> <span id="s15">This is tape one, side one.</span> <span id="s16">Charlene, you did your oral history interview 10 years ago, almost exactly 10 years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Answer: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: March ’93.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: Really?</span> <span id="s20">Almost 10 years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: March ’93.</span> <span id="s22">And I just listened to it again.</span> <span id="s23">It was a remarkable experience as a listener, to hear it.</span> <span id="s24">But I want to start, because this is a post-Holocaust interview, at the end of that experience when you were by yourself in the forest.</span> <span id="s25">You’d been wandering for a couple years, maybe?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: A couple -- three winters and two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: Three winters, yeah.</span> <span id="s28">And you were liberated, as you say --</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: At [indecipherable] by --</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: -- by some Russian soldiers --</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: -- soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: -- who found you.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: Well, yeah, they were pushing they -- at that time they were pushing the Germans back and as it happened -- I don’t know, it was I guess, an entire battalion, I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s34">But Russian soldiers, Soviet Union soldiers were marching through the forest where I was dying, actually.</span> <span id="s35">I -- usually when I was in the forest, I would dig a little grave and cover it, camouflage it as much as I could and stay there as long as hunger and cold would allow me to stay in one place.</span> <span id="s36">At that point I was very ill, I must have eaten something that didn’t agree with me.</span> <span id="s37">And I was in my own filth, surrounded by my own filth, and I -- I think I was dying.</span> <span id="s38">I don’t really recall one time, I think, that I wasn’t actually aware of it, and yet I must have been aware.</span> <span id="s39">When they literally stepped on me, it was dark, at night and all of a sudden I felt -- I mean, in -- in the forest there are always a lot of noises, so I didn’t hear them coming.</span> <span id="s40">But all of a sudden I felt something on my chest, and it was, I guess, one of the soldiers.</span> <span id="s41">And they realized it was something alive.</span> <span id="s42">And to their credit and my luck, they did clean me up and put me in a tent in a -- a military hospital and dragged me with them until we came to the city of Luck, L-u-c-k, which is in the area where I come from.</span> <span id="s43">And there they found a -- a regular hospital and they left me there.</span> <span id="s44">And apparently -- I never saw the note, but apparently there was a note saying -- and I’m paraphrasing, but it was something like, this is a child of the forests.</span> <span id="s45">Treat her gently, with great care.</span> <span id="s46">And that note was pinned to me, to my -- whatever I was wearing.</span> <span id="s47">All --</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: How old were you at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: In that time -- I -- it was in 1944, so how old was I?</span> <span id="s50">19 -- I guess it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: You were born in ’29?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: Yeah, December ’29, and that was --</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: So you were 14 - 15?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: -- 14 -- 14 years old, or so, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s56">Do you remember them carry -- they must have carried you.</span> <span id="s57">Do you remember any of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: No, I --</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: Do you remember them speaking with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: No, all I remember is someone kept saying yebishka, yebishka and that means in Russian, l-little girl, little girl.</span> <span id="s61">But I did not speak.</span> <span id="s62">I don’t remember speaking.</span> <span id="s63">I kept throwing up, and I was very, very ill.</span> <span id="s64">And -- but I vaguely remember it.</span> <span id="s65">And then when I did get into the hospital -- yeah, I don’t think they carried me.</span> <span id="s66">I think they had like a -- horses with wagons.</span> <span id="s67">And I don’t really know, maybe they did carry me, but they did have that.</span> <span id="s68">And then they would have tents in forest --</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: Camps, they had camps, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: Camps, yes, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: And they treated me very well.</span> <span id="s73">And later on, after the war we went to Russia because I went back to my hometown, which is another story, which I’ll tell you about.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: You told some of that in the first interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: Did I?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: About going back, mm-hm, you did.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: Where they tried to --</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: And when you went to the town and then tried to take your son.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: Yeah, did I tell about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: Yeah, you did, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: Well, anyway, but I tried to find out who were -- what kind of a te -- who were the -- the soldiers, especially the two soldiers who first found me, and were so -- gave me back my life.</span> <span id="s82">And I couldn’t get names or anything.</span> <span id="s83">I know one thing, that I still had a gold coin, and I th -- the coins and all the jewelry that my mother sewed in, I don’t know if I told that in my first interview --</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: Yes, you did, how she put them into your clothes.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: Yes, but a -- I lost the coat and all that.</span> <span id="s86">And so then I had like a rope, a -- a real heavy rope that I wore on my neck.</span> <span id="s87">And that and my little penknife I had with me and the gold -- gold coins and whatever else, and jewelry.</span> <span id="s88">And I still had one coin and I gave it to them, to the two soldiers.</span> <span id="s89">I -- I do remember that, that was it.</span> <span id="s90">But other than that, there was no real thank you or anything, for giving me back my life.</span> <span id="s91">But when I ended up in the hospital at Luck, that’s where they nursed me back to, I guess, reasonable health.</span> <span id="s92">I did not speak for a long, long time, and I do remember that -- how I regained my speech.</span> <span id="s93">I was on a ward.</span> <span id="s94">At that time, I mean, there were no private rooms, or if there were I wasn’t in one.</span> <span id="s95">And I was just in my cot, whatever, in clean sheets, it was wonderful.</span> <span id="s96">And -- but I did not speak.</span> <span id="s97">And then all of a sudden there was an attendant.</span> <span id="s98">It was not a doctor and it was not a nurse, but a young woman.</span> <span id="s99">And she was sort of humming while she was doing things and all of a sudden she started singing a song that my mother used to sing to me.</span> <span id="s100">And, I mean it just gave me chills and I started talking.</span> <span id="s101">That, you know, brought back my speech.</span> <span id="s102">And it was a very, you know, emotional day at that time.</span> <span id="s103">But when I was nursed back to health, I found there was one other survivor from my hometown.</span> <span id="s104">And it seemed that most of the survivors -- the war was not over yet in 1944, but for us, for all intents and purposes, the war was over.</span> <span id="s105">And so everybody who survived tried to gather in a larger town.</span> <span id="s106">And Luck, or Lvov, which now is called Lviv were the two big cities and all the little shtetls were in between.</span> <span id="s107">And Horochow, my town, was also in between.</span> <span id="s108">So a lot of people gathered in Luck, and that’s where I was, in that hospital.</span> <span id="s109">And I came out of the hospital, I found a lot of -- not a lot, but survivors.</span> <span id="s110">And I did meet the other survivor from my hometown.</span> <span id="s111">They say that there are more people who survived, but these were people who my father and other people in Horochow helped escape before the war started and who eventually ended up in what was then Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: And as a matter of fact, when we went, my husband and I went to Israel a number of years ago, I can’t remember when, the st -- these were old students of my father’s and they gathered together and they had an evening dedicated to the memory of my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: And that was very -- it was very -- it made me feel very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: But coming back to Luck.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: Before we go, can you put this on the table, cause I can hear it pretty si -- loudly.</span> <span id="s119">Yeah, that’s fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: Sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: That’s okay.</span> <span id="s122">So you -- you went to this meeting, people were gathering, survivors were gathering and you met this one survivor who was from your town, somebody that you knew before?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: Well, she was -- she used to be a st -- a part time student of my father’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: And -- because my father taught at the university in Lvov, but he also taught in Horochow.</span> <span id="s126">There were several different schools there and there was a gymnasium.</span> <span id="s127">A gymnasium is a -- not a gymnasium here, like here, but it is the next step after high school.</span> <span id="s128">Sort of an in-between school.</span> <span id="s129">But anyway, I did know her family.</span> <span id="s130">She was actually married before the war and had a baby, but she lost her entire family, and she survived by herself.</span> <span id="s131">And the two of us decided to go back to my hometown, and -- to our hometown and to find out maybe some other people or our loved ones survived.</span> <span id="s132">And so we set out.</span> <span id="s133">Transportation was very difficult in those days.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: How far was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: Well, it wa -- by car now, it would be an hour and a half, that’s all.</span> <span id="s136">And at that time there was no car -- there were no cars available.</span> <span id="s137">Trains were going maybe once a week or so, so you had to hitchhike, and -- with the soldiers, with the military or with farmers in trucks, or just wagons with horses.</span> <span id="s138">It took us two days to get back to our -- our hometown.</span> <span id="s139">And there we were not greeted very warmly.</span> <span id="s140">The people in our hometown -- and this was going on all over eastern Poland, I don’t know about other countries, but in eastern Po -- what used to be eastern Poland, the populace was very greedy and they did get everything.</span> <span id="s141">All our possessions, all our material possessions ended up in their hands because when we were ordered to go into the ghetto, we could only take with us what we could carry, nothing else.</span> <span id="s142">And so everything else went to the neighbors and whoever got ahold of it, or -- I don’t know how the Germans and the Ukrainians at that time directed and disposed of all the material goods.</span> <span id="s143">And then there were homes, houses.</span> <span id="s144">And they felt, I’m sure, the local populace, that whoever survived [indecipherable] will come and say now, I want my house back, I want my -- all my furniture back.</span> <span id="s145">I want my linens, my silver, my -- all sorts of stuff.</span> <span id="s146">And that probably -- and besides, there was still, and still is, there’s great anti-Semitism in that area.</span> <span id="s147">And they resented our surviving and that made us feel very, very hurt.</span> <span id="s148">And it seemed at that point that there was a movement that -- you know how rumors start and all, and there was a movement in our -- our -- our direction for everyone to gather in Germany.</span> <span id="s149">Why in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: Let me ask you one question before --</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: -- we go to Germany.</span> <span id="s153">Do you remember any -- I know it’s a long time ago, but do you remember any specific encounters with people in your hometown when you went back that first time?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: And did you go to your house?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: And you must have seen neighbors or people that you knew quite well --</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: Yes, yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: -- cause it had -- was only a few years --</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: -- yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: -- that you were away.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: So do you remember anything [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: Yeah, the first thing I would say th -- and I mean, oh, you’re Professor Perlmutter’s daughter.</span> <span id="s165">I said yes.</span> <span id="s166">And, you know, and I would ask of some -- because o-of school, people who went -- I mean, kids who went to school with me, you know.</span> <span id="s167">And I said where is such and such, you know, Marusha Trikoska who was right -- living near us and all.</span> <span id="s168">And couldn’t find anyone that went to school with me, or the younger people, but the older people kept saying, oh, you are so -- my -- my dear, dear girl, you know.</span> <span id="s169">If only we knew what was happening, what was going on, we would have helped.</span> <span id="s170">Well, how could they not have known?</span> <span id="s171">And I mean they were right there, we were surrounded by our neighbors before we went into the ghetto and I-I mean especially in the very beginning, the Germans when they first came in, they had lists with names whom to take.</span> <span id="s172">And when my father was -- when they came after my father and that was right in the very beginning after they burned the synagogues and all that, and my father tried to escape through the back door, there were two Ukrainians right there, who we knew, and they wouldn’t let him -- they wouldn’t even let him say goodbye to us.</span> <span id="s173">So they knew.</span> <span id="s174">But that was their response; if only we knew, we would have helped.</span> <span id="s175">And that’s -- that -- that -- I heard that all over in my neighborhood.</span> <span id="s176">The house, I did not go into my house.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: Somebody had taken it over?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: Oh yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: -- somebody was living there.</span> <span id="s181">And I --</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: It was a nice house.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: It was a very nice house, and as a matter of fact, I mean there were still several rooms, I think two rooms that were never finished because my father had hoped that we would go to the United States and he, just at that point he didn’t want to put -- we weren’t rich, I mean he was an educator.</span> <span id="s184">And -- but the thing was that he didn't want to put any more money into the house, and he left two rooms or so unfinished, and they were still unfinished at the end of war, or when we came, you know, to -- to see.</span> <span id="s185">My friend, the other survivor, lived actually on the outskirts of Horochow, and it was a little village, almost like a suburb and the name of it was Skamelka.</span> <span id="s186">And she went back there, and she didn’t find anyone very receptive, very happy about her survival.</span> <span id="s187">She was actually hidden by a farmer throughout the entire war.</span> <span id="s188">So she had one friend.</span> <span id="s189">What is so very puzzling to me -- it’s not puzzling, it’s just very disappointing to this day.</span> <span id="s190">I’ve gotten rid of the hate and the anger because it was destroying me personally, but I feel a great disappointment by the fact or from the fact that our neighbors and our town, where we co-existed in a very nice way, my father and mother and other Jewish leaders were working hand in hand with the Gentile population for the good of the entire community.</span> <span id="s191">And I’m not just saying that, but it’s such a puzzlement to me that friends and neighbors who lived in -- in harmony, all of a sudden, overnight could turn into enemies, and not one of them helped.</span> <span id="s192">And I know it was dangerous to help, but when my mother was digging ditches outside from -- you know, in the ghetto and she was trying to trade something for food, not one of our neighbors would give her anything.</span> <span id="s193">Strangers would, but not our neighbors.</span> <span id="s194">Why?</span> <span id="s195">Why such hate?</span> <span id="s196">I-I -- I cannot understand it.</span> <span id="s197">And I don’t know -- now I was thinking maybe it’s envy.</span> <span id="s198">It was envy because they worked hard, most of them were poor peasants, you know, and they never accomplished anything in their lives.</span> <span id="s199">They never became educated, they didn’t stress education.</span> <span id="s200">And they were always working and they were poor peasants in the beginning and they were poor peasants at the end.</span> <span id="s201">And maybe that’s why, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s202">But anyway, we did realize that we were not welcome in Horochow and other people who went back to the neighboring villages and shtetls had the same reception as we did, and so we set out to go to Germany at --</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: And did you find out anything about your parents or your sister in that visit?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: Well, at that time I only fou -- I found I didn’t -- nobody knew anything about my mother, but in retrospect I’m sure that she was probably killed by a bullet or so and drowned in the -- in the --</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: River.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: -- river.</span> <span id="s207">But -- they wouldn’t tell me who, but my -- my sister was denounced.</span> <span id="s208">And there again is a long story and I don’t know if I mentioned this in my oral story that I, you know, gave with Dr. Ringelheim, but my sister was actually a musical prodigy, and she played the piano and she also played the violin extra, extra beautifully.</span> <span id="s209">As a matter of fact, at one time -- and that was way before the war started, my father bought a very well known, a very -- a name -- I can’t remember.</span> <span id="s210">It was not a Stradivarius, but a very good violin for my sister because she was exceptionally -- an exceptional artist.</span> <span id="s211">And she played in recitals and she would have gone far because it was her love of her life.</span> <span id="s212">And when we went to the ghetto, I know my -- I can’t remember what I said in my story, but I don’t know if I even emphasized that, but my mother kept telling us to take only, I mean, just clothing and only the dearest things that we wanted to have with us.</span> <span id="s213">She took all the pictures.</span> <span id="s214">We don’t have any pictures, my mother did take them and of course we lost them.</span> <span id="s215">But my sister did not listen to my mother, and whatever she took I don’t know, but she also took her violin to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s216">Actually, she should have given it to the Germans because they wanted all musical instruments and all, but she wouldn’t part with that violin.</span> <span id="s217">And what she did, she was wearing a loose dress, and she took the violin and the what do you call, the bow out of the --</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: Case?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: -- case, and she didn’t take the case.</span> <span id="s220">But she took them and she tied it with something, you know, but she would not part with it.</span> <span id="s221">And when my mother found a place for her with a farmer, and it was time for her to go there, she went right from work.</span> <span id="s222">I don’t recall exactly how, but she took her violin with her.</span> <span id="s223">And I was told two versions, I’m not -- I’m not sure which is right.</span> <span id="s224">One that the -- the farmer who agreed with my mother to hide my sister -- one person, my sister, that he denounced her because he wanted the violin.</span> <span id="s225">And the other one was that she was denounced by someone else and she was paraded naked through the main street and then they murdered her.</span> <span id="s226">I don’t know which is the right story, but that’s what I was told by my neighbors when we came back to learn the fate of the rest of our families, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: So you found that out --</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: -- that --</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: -- first time you went home?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: But they wouldn’t give me names.</span> <span id="s233">Nobody would give me names of the -- I didn’t even know the name of the farmer who was hiding, or was supposed to hide my sister.</span> <span id="s234">I didn't know that.</span> <span id="s235">And I don’t know if I was too stupid, I just didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: And -- but I did know the name of the guy, the farmer who was supposed to hide my mother and me, and actually I did know and I don’t know if I said it in my other story, but we used to buy dairy products from that --</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: Yes, you told that --</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: Did I say that?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: -- yes, and then you went there after you lost your mother --</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: Yes, I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: -- and he had your father’s gold watch.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: Yes, yeah, did I say that?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s245">And he would only let you stay overnight.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: One day.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: Yeah, one day and then when it got dark --</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: -- out I went.</span> <span id="s251">And I asked if he was still alive when I went back and they said, oh yeah, h-he was still alive.</span> <span id="s252">And -- but I never, when we went back, I mean, we only had an hour and a ha -- two hours they told me, and we couldn’t go, but God willing, before I die -- I don’t know if he’s still alive, but I’m sure some of his -- you know, sons and daughters are probably still there, and I do want to face.</span> <span id="s253">I want to meet them face to face and talk to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: So you went then, you and this other --</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: Sonia.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: Sonia, went to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: You heard that there was going to be a meeting there, a gathering.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: Gathering.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: A gathering.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: That everyone who survived was gathered there.</span> <span id="s262">Why?</span> <span id="s263">Because there -- we were safer there, because it was -- they had the American --</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: Sector, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: -- sector.</span> <span id="s266">Then they had the French and the British and the Russian.</span> <span id="s267">And of course we wanted to go to the American sector.</span> <span id="s268">And we -- our journey was also an experience.</span> <span id="s269">Again, there was no transportation.</span> <span id="s270">We didn’t have I.D.s, we didn’t have anything, we were just, you know, stragglers.</span> <span id="s271">But we went by groups and we had to travel illegally.</span> <span id="s272">I didn’t have any money or anything, but other people did have some, and we went in -- in groups.</span> <span id="s273">And so we ended up going from Luck to Kraków, which is the southern part of Poland.</span> <span id="s274">And then from Kraków we made our way to Bratislava, which was at that time Czechoslovakia, and from there -- and people along the way, as long as it wasn’t the militia, you know, were very kind.</span> <span id="s275">They would give us bread, and sometimes they would even bring some like hot soup or so to feed us.</span> <span id="s276">And from Bratislava we ended up in Vienna, where the reception wasn’t very good.</span> <span id="s277">And then from Vienna we finally ended up in Munich.</span> <span id="s278">And in Munich, or right around the area of Munich, we were put in what they called DP camps, Displaced Person’s camps.</span> <span id="s279">Now these camps were actually under the auspices, the people who formed and organized these camps, it was the United Nations Rehabilitation and Relief Agency.</span> <span id="s280">Gee, I got it out right.</span> <span id="s281">And they were the main people who organized these camps.</span> <span id="s282">It was the first experience, the first camp -- I can’t remember where it was, it wasn’t actually outside of Munich.</span> <span id="s283">I think I ended up someplace -- Salzheim, Salzheim, I think in Austria, that was my first camp.</span> <span id="s284">And there -- and you know, at that point everybody sort of went their own way.</span> <span id="s285">I lost my -- Sonia, I -- I -- you know, she ended up someplace else.</span> <span id="s286">But the first experience in the camp was very traumatic.</span> <span id="s287">We were still filthy, we had lice.</span> <span id="s288">We really needed a disinfection.</span> <span id="s289">And the way it was given to us was rather primitively.</span> <span id="s290">I remember we had to undress, and it du -- didn’t matter if there were man, women.</span> <span id="s291">It was one corner there with maybe a sheet hanging in between.</span> <span id="s292">You had to strip completely and then they put a hose on you.</span> <span id="s293">And the hose had white -- it looked like white powder.</span> <span id="s294">And that powder, I can still smell it.</span> <span id="s295">I feel it in my body.</span> <span id="s296">That powder was an anti what do you call it, disinfective --</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: Sometimes they used DDT.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: Maybe that --</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: Sometimes they did, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: -- it smelled like sulfur and like rotten eggs, and they kept spraying -- and I’m not exaggerating, for maybe two hours.</span> <span id="s301">And it seems by the time you were finished -- my hair was chopped anyway because I had so many lice and all, everybody was filthy.</span> <span id="s302">But they kept spraying without mercy.</span> <span id="s303">And I kept saying enough, enough, you know, in Yiddish or in Polish.</span> <span id="s304">They didn’t pay any attention to you.</span> <span id="s305">And by the -- after your -- you were finished with that powder that penetrated every pore of your body, then they made you go and take a shower.</span> <span id="s306">And of course the shower was pretty cold.</span> <span id="s307">But it was good --</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: To get clean.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: -- to get clean.</span> <span id="s310">And I mean, we still weren’t really clean and I think a week later they would line us up again and spray maybe for half an hour.</span> <span id="s311">And they did this several times.</span> <span id="s312">So by the time we came to Munich, or the ti -- by the time I came to Munich, I was pretty decent.</span> <span id="s313">I mean, I -- I didn't have any lice crawling around my body and I -- I had some kind of -- they gave me a dress, and a pants -- no, I don’t remember, but an outfit.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: And you were feeling better physically?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: Not really.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: No, no --</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: You were --</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: -- I felt very --</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: What was your physical condition?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: My physical condition wasn’t bad.</span> <span id="s322">Emotionally all of us were very distraught and very disappointed.</span> <span id="s323">I was very confused and I still had hopes that I would find my mother.</span> <span id="s324">Because they said in Horochow, nobody knew about my mother.</span> <span id="s325">And I couldn’t face the reality and the fact that she vanished and she perished right there when I was there.</span> <span id="s326">I still to this day, I don’t know, but it seems I’m -- I’m getting away from it, but when I walk on a street and I see someone with the build of my father or mother, they were both very tall -- though look at me, I’m a shrimp.</span> <span id="s327">But my father was over six foot, about six four or so, very, very tall.</span> <span id="s328">And my mother was very tall, almost six foot tall.</span> <span id="s329">And when I see people, you know, walking from the back and it reminds me of their build, I have to rush up and look back and see, because I still think maybe it’s them.</span> <span id="s330">Anyway, when we came to Munich and we -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: This is tape one, side two, Charlene Schiff.</span> <span id="s332">Okay, you new -- came to Munich.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: When I came to Munich we w-were -- at that point we were assigned to some DP camps, and there was one DP camp a little bit outside of Munich by the name of Fernwald.</span> <span id="s334">That’s one of the big DP camps and one of the ones that I spent a lot of time in.</span> <span id="s335">I came there and I was assigned a space to live.</span> <span id="s336">A bunk, a bed, a very narrow bed, and a little like a foot locker, like a locker, and that was mine.</span> <span id="s337">I was given a cake of soap, the first time I think in five years.</span> <span id="s338">In the other camps where I was disinfected and all, they didn’t have that.</span> <span id="s339">It was very, very, very primitive.</span> <span id="s340">But in Fernwald it was sort of a little more luxurious.</span> <span id="s341">I did get a toothbrush for the first time in five years.</span> <span id="s342">I got some toothpaste and as I said a -- a cake of soap, and a little rag that was my towel.</span> <span id="s343">And food was still rationed three times a day.</span> <span id="s344">It was adequate, but I was still very hungry most of the time, in the beginning.</span> <span id="s345">But at that time, I knew my m -- I remembered my grandmother’s address in the United States.</span> <span id="s346">Because all my young life I think the conversations between my parents and me were always centering around the f -- the fact, when we get to America.</span> <span id="s347">And anyway, I -- my grandmother’s address was 231 Echo Place, Bronx 57, New York.</span> <span id="s348">And I wrote a letter to my grandmother and told her that I was alive and I’m looking for my parents and my sister, but I --</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: This was your father’s mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: Yes, yeah.</span> <span id="s351">And she was a widow when she emigrated to America.</span> <span id="s352">I -- it didn’t take very -- I mean, it wasn’t right away, but I did get an answer shortly.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: What was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A: Her name was Hana, Hana Perlmutter.</span> <span id="s355">And I saw pictures of her -- I mean, I knew her from pictures, because I don’t know if she emigrated before I was born or after.</span> <span id="s356">Time before is sort of hazy to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: I don’t think I ever met her actually, in person.</span> <span id="s359">But I did receive an answer and I don’t know who wrote it, but one of the sisters, apparently, one of my aunts wrote it.</span> <span id="s360">And I was informed that my grandma died during the war.</span> <span id="s361">Ostensibly later they told me of a broken heart because her one and only son never joined her, my father.</span> <span id="s362">But anyway, the sisters, the aunts got together and sent me papers and affidavits which testified to the fact that I would not become a burden to the government and so I should be allowed to emigrate right away.</span> <span id="s363">And oh, when I got these papers I didn’t know what -- because it was all in English and I had to, you know, go to someone who spoke it, who understood English and they, you know, translate it all to me.</span> <span id="s364">And I -- I was so happy, and I went to the consulate.</span> <span id="s365">And I can’t remember, I think I had to go to Bremen, I’m not quite sure where.</span> <span id="s366">And there my enthusiasm and my hope were extinguished right away.</span> <span id="s367">Oh, that’s not enough, you have to have other papers, and we have so many people who are -- who need to go before you.</span> <span id="s368">And we’ll let you know, don’t call us, we’ll call you or su -- or something to that effect.</span> <span id="s369">So I went back to the DP camp very, very disappointed.</span> <span id="s370">And at that point I really didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s371">I started a correspondence with my family in the United States and they kept sending new papers, and you know, thinking they need this and that.</span> <span id="s372">And every time I’d go to -- to Bremen, which cost, at that point cost a lot of money to go, and then I would come back with nothing accomplished.</span> <span id="s373">At that time I’m still -- I mean, kept looking, and I don’t know if -- if anyone else was telling you this, but wherever we went, we would always have a big board or some kind of a wall, and everybody would leave little notes, paper notes, say, do you know such and such?</span> <span id="s374">I am from there and you know, and my name is such and such.</span> <span id="s375">If you have ever heard of someone, you know, please let me know and give an address.</span> <span id="s376">Cause phones were not as, you know, a-available as they are here.</span> <span id="s377">But write here and -- and let me know.</span> <span id="s378">And a lot of people did get some connections from these information walls as it were -- were ba -- as it were.</span> <span id="s379">I did not get any information from my family, or from anyone else in my town.</span> <span id="s380">I know at the museum they keep saying that there were more than two survivors, but again --</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: From your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: Yes, but these people who survived, were not actually from Horochow.</span> <span id="s383">They were from different villages and all, because the only one who survived with me was this Sonia, which has died last year, actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: She made it to the States?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: Oh, oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: Oh yeah, she made it to the States.</span> <span id="s388">She remarried and she had two wonderful children, very accomplished.</span> <span id="s389">One is a -- a radiologist in California, and the daughter also has a very important job in the San Francisco area.</span> <span id="s390">Sonia actually, and her husband, they lived in Duluth, Minnesota because she had some family there, and that’s where they started their new life.</span> <span id="s391">And she would have been another sh -- you know, wonderful designer because she had golden hands.</span> <span id="s392">I remember the first thing she made in Luck before we left, she made me an outfit from an old military blanket.</span> <span id="s393">And that’s what I was wearing until we came to the DP camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: When you were in that camp near Munich, far --</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: Fernwald, Fernwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: Fernwald, and going back and forth and trying to get to America, what did you do?</span> <span id="s397">What -- what -- wa -- how did you spend your time?</span> <span id="s398">Did you have friends?</span> <span id="s399">Did you have a boyfriend?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: Well, yes -- no.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: Lot of people -- lot of people hooked up right away --</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: -- and got married immediately --</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: I did -- yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: -- in those camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: -- no, I did not.</span> <span id="s407">And I -- I -- I felt if I didn’t have family in the United States, I would have probably gone to Israel.</span> <span id="s408">And I did get invi -- it wasn’t Israel, it was Palestine at that time.</span> <span id="s409">I got involved with the Betar, B-e-t-a-r, it’s the -- they were vini -- revisionist group and they had like a kibbutz in Fernwald.</span> <span id="s410">And I went there in the very beginning and I met very nice young people.</span> <span id="s411">Men, women and -- I mean, girls and boys.</span> <span id="s412">But after they figured out -- and I -- I guess I told them, I wasn’t going to pretend, that actually I was hoping to go to the United States, I couldn’t be there any longer.</span> <span id="s413">And so I found a place -- or, they f -- assigned me another place to live.</span> <span id="s414">But when my efforts to join my family in -- in the United States were coming to nothing, I decided that perhaps -- I only had a third grade education -- I decided maybe I could go to school and emigrate on a student visa.</span> <span id="s415">And at that time I felt that -- I don’t know why, but there was a DP camp by the name Benzheim and that was between Darmstadt and Frankfurt, and very close to Heidelberg.</span> <span id="s416">And I’m not sure, but I think my father had a lot of, you know, doctorates, and one of them, I think, was from Heidelberg.</span> <span id="s417">And I went to Heidelberg and I spoke German at that -- you know, so I asked them if they would take me on as a student.</span> <span id="s418">And they sort of looked me up and down, and where are your papers, you know, from school?</span> <span id="s419">And I said I have none.</span> <span id="s420">And they were very helpful.</span> <span id="s421">They gave me a tutor and they took all sorts of crazy tests.</span> <span id="s422">And because, I guess, I was a Jewish survivor, they accepted me.</span> <span id="s423">I stayed there for over a year, and thought that I would go -- emigrate on a student visa.</span> <span id="s424">But by that time my papers started taking on importance and I eventually ended up going on the papers that my family provided for me.</span> <span id="s425">But it took three years after the war before I ended up in the United States.</span> <span id="s426">There’s one other thing that I would like to mention, and I do mention it all, you know, when I speak to schools, and -- which I’ve been doing since 1985, and we’ll get back to that.</span> <span id="s427">I -- it was very difficult for me to comprehend and to understand that even after the war, there were pogroms in Poland.</span> <span id="s428">Not just eastern Poland, but all over Poland.</span> <span id="s429">Now, the eastern part of Poland, after the war ended, became the property of the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s430">So Poland was actually divided.</span> <span id="s431">And the Poland that I knew from before the war was no more.</span> <span id="s432">It was -- a third of it was chunked off to the Soviet regime.</span> <span id="s433">And what was going on all over Poland were pogroms, after the war.</span> <span id="s434">And the local populace was so resentful of our surviving that to them the only solution of getting rid of us is to kill us.</span> <span id="s435">And I don’t know if you’ve ever heard of Kielce.</span> <span id="s436">Kielce is someplace -- my geography is not that good, but I think it’s in central Poland.</span> <span id="s437">And Kielce was a big town, a big city and had a lot of Jews before the war.</span> <span id="s438">On the fourth of July, 1946, the local populace got together and murdered 42 Jewish survivors.</span> <span id="s439">And that was one of the most infamous pogroms.</span> <span id="s440">I think they mention it on the second floor in the museum, when they talk about DP camps and all.</span> <span id="s441">Kielce, one of the most infamous pogroms.</span> <span id="s442">And that was devastating to hear when we were in the DP camps, about these happenings.</span> <span id="s443">And this was going on all over the place in Poland.</span> <span id="s444">So when anybody says that now there are no Jews in Poland, and consequently there can’t be any anti-Semitism, it ain’t so.</span> <span id="s445">It’s not so, and I would like to -- I wanted to make that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: Now back to my --</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: I wa --</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: So you -- you -- your paperwork came through --</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: -- eventually.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: Eventually.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: And you were in -- studying near Heidelberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: In Heidelberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: In Heidelberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: Yeah, in the University of Heidelberg.</span> <span id="s458">But actually, what I was doing, I was not getting grades there.</span> <span id="s459">I was what do you call it, a -- what do you call when you go -- you take courses, but you’re not graded?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: I don’t know monitoring classes?</span> <span id="s461">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: Well, I mean, I -- I -- I was not -- I -- there’s a special word and I can’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: -- think of it now.</span> <span id="s465">But I mean, I -- at that point it was, you know, i-it -- I mean it -- my thought was good in the beginning but it didn’t work out anyway, because I just left and -- and I went and I ca -- I mean, I did receive the word that it’s -- you know, my time has come.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: And I ca -- arrived, I was -- I arrived on the Marine Flasher.</span> <span id="s468">That’s the boat’s name and there is a picture of the boat -- of the ship, you can call it boat, in the museum on the second floor.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: I mean, it’s not ba -- I’m not on the p -- in the picture, but that’s the ship that I arrived in th --</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: Where did you leave from?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: From Bremen, Bremerhaven, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: And I was sick as a dog all during our journey.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: Seasick.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: Seasick, oh, and I mean I -- I couldn’t even keep Coke down, they ga -- nothing, it was terrible.</span> <span id="s477">And I’m still not a very good motion traveler, but I arrived in the United States, June 25th, 1948, in New York.</span> <span id="s478">And my aunt from Columbus came to pick me up and --</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: Can I ask you about that experience of come -- did you come in on boat during the day?</span> <span id="s480">Did you see New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: I was so sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: You don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: I didn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: I don’t remember anything.</span> <span id="s486">I don’t remember seeing the Statue of Liberty.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: No-Nothing, I was too sick, no.</span> <span id="s489">And as a matter of fact, I’ve ha -- I remember when I came and most of the people were being picked up in the what do you call -- the Port of ath -- of authority.</span> <span id="s490">And there were two young people, cause my -- my aunt had to come from Columbus to New York to go -- she had to go to her sister, one of the sisters and there -- from there she was going to go to the port of authority, or whatever you call it.</span> <span id="s491">But she was late.</span> <span id="s492">Trai -- she came by train and the train was late, or something.</span> <span id="s493">So the people who met me at the port was a young couple, I don’t know who they were.</span> <span id="s494">And it was an engaged couple, another cousin Rosalie from New York, from another ci -- another sister’s daughter and her fiancé.</span> <span id="s495">And the fiancé, Stanley, who eventu -- I mean, married her, he recognized me because I sent them a picture of me from the DP camps.</span> <span id="s496">And they were looking and looking and I didn’t know for whom to look and he recognized me from the picture and they picked me up and took me to my Aunt Belka’s place, which was also it the Bronx someplace.</span> <span id="s497">And there was my aunt from Columbus.</span> <span id="s498">And I want to describe to you that moment because that is something I’ll take to my grave.</span> <span id="s499">When I -- when I met -- I mean my -- my cousin Rosalie from New York who came to pick me up and Stanley, her boyfriend at th -- her fiancé.</span> <span id="s500">They were nice young people and they tried to talk Yiddish and it was just not very successful.</span> <span id="s501">And then I came to my Aunt Belka, who lived near where my grandmother lived, and -- used to live.</span> <span id="s502">And there was this apartment, a very small apartment.</span> <span id="s503">And there, when I came in, there was my aunt from Columbus, Aunt Bertha -- Brocha.</span> <span id="s504">And I’ve never in my life seen such a wa -- vision of beauty.</span> <span id="s505">She was very petite -- all my father’s sisters are short or were short and that’s the way I am.</span> <span id="s506">But she was blonde, she was petite.</span> <span id="s507">She had -- her hair was beautifully coiffed and she was wearing a green, a silk green dress.</span> <span id="s508">It was in the summer, obviously.</span> <span id="s509">She made that dress.</span> <span id="s510">She made all her clothes and some of mine, too.</span> <span id="s511">And her daughter, Rosalie’s.</span> <span id="s512">Sh -- the dress had a V neck, with a double collar in green and the bodice was very tightly fitting and then it was a flared skirt with piping and the we -- the west -- the waist and short sleeves, and she was wearing high heels and silk stockings, and she wore make-up.</span> <span id="s513">And she had blue eyes and her skin was like -- like peaches.</span> <span id="s514">She was beautiful.</span> <span id="s515">I’ve never seen anybody -- she was -- she looked a little bit like Zsa Zsa Gabor, only she was prettier.</span> <span id="s516">She was really was a beauti -- a stunning beauty.</span> <span id="s517">And she started to speaking to me in Yiddish, and she gave me a hug, and I’ll never forget that.</span> <span id="s518">She was so good to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: You must have just felt so relieved and so --</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: Well, no, I didn't feel -- I felt awed --</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: Awed.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: -- by her.</span> <span id="s523">Yeah, I felt such, oh, there was such a beauty.</span> <span id="s524">And she’s my aunt, you know?</span> <span id="s525">And sh-she was really so beautiful that before learning of her goodness and of her wonderful qualities otherwise, I was just awed by her physical beauty.</span> <span id="s526">Everyone was always awed by her physical beauty.</span> <span id="s527">She was an -- I should have brought a picture, because I do have pictures of her.</span> <span id="s528">She was probably the most beautiful creature I have ever met.</span> <span id="s529">I don’t see movie stars who are as beautiful as she is.</span> <span id="s530">And she was also very smart.</span> <span id="s531">And she was a very special woman.</span> <span id="s532">And she was very good to me.</span> <span id="s533">She was wise and she tried her best to give me the love that I needed at that time.</span> <span id="s534">But her heart was also broken at that time, because she had lost her husband very shortly before I came to the United States, and she had a younger -- a young daughter, two years younger than I, but the same birthday, the same month and same day.</span> <span id="s535">And then she had two married sons.</span> <span id="s536">The first thing they did after getting acquainted with my Aunt Brocha and my Aunt Belka, who was also a very good looking woman with dark hair and dark eyes and dark complected, but also very nice and tried --</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: They were sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s539">And sh-she -- th-they both -- everyone tried to be very nice to me, but what they did at first, and that hurt so much, I came, and before I came to the States, I did receive several care packages.</span> <span id="s540">They said they -- they sent an awful lot of them to me personally.</span> <span id="s541">I only got about three or four in all the years.</span> <span id="s542">Someone else was helping themselves to my packages.</span> <span id="s543">But in the packages there were cigarettes.</span> <span id="s544">And cigarettes were a very desire -- desired commodity.</span> <span id="s545">I would sa -- I wasn’t doing any black market there, I guess I was.</span> <span id="s546">I would sell the cigarettes, I didn't smoke.</span> <span id="s547">And with the money I got myself outfitted to go to America.</span> <span id="s548">So I had leather boots up to my knees, and I had a little herringbone coat.</span> <span id="s549">And I had, I can’t remember what kind of dress, and I had another dress in a little suitcase.</span> <span id="s550">My hair that time was long, and the fashion was to have ringlets.</span> <span id="s551">And I didn’t wear any make-up or anything.</span> <span id="s552">What was I, 17 or so?</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: 17 - 18?</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: But they took me into the bathroom and the first thing they did, without asking me or anything, they took off my coat, they took off my boots, they say a young girl doesn’t wear that here.</span> <span id="s555">And they chopped off my hair.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: Hm.</span> <span id="s557">Why?</span> <span id="s558">You don’t know.</span> <span id="s559">What do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: Fashion?</span> <span id="s562">They wanted you to look American?</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: I wasn’t asked.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: And all of a sudden I felt like a plucked chicken.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: Yeah, I bet.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: And then I went on the train.</span> <span id="s568">I don’t remember if it was the same day or the next day, I went on a train with my Aunt Bertha, Brocha, to go to Columbus.</span> <span id="s569">And that’s where my new life started.</span> <span id="s570">When I came in, I mean she was so -- she -- she was really a ver -- an extraordinary person.</span> <span id="s571">And the first thing -- she was already living in a small apartment.</span> <span id="s572">They got rid of the house where things happened, and where she lost her husband, whom I never met, my Uncle Lieber, Leonard.</span> <span id="s573">But she lived in a small apartment -- well, it wasn’t really small.</span> <span id="s574">There was a living room and a small dining room and kitchen on one floor and then upstairs there were two bedrooms and a bath.</span> <span id="s575">And one bathroom was Rosalie’s, one bedroom was Rosalie’s, my cousin --</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: Your cousin?</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: -- yes.</span> <span id="s578">Who’s also -- she looks a little bit like her mom.</span> <span id="s579">She’s blonde, blue-eyed and very pretty.</span> <span id="s580">And Rosalie had one bedroom and then my Aunt Brocha and I had the other bedroom, where there were two single beds.</span> <span id="s581">The first months were very difficult for everyone concerned, for many reasons.</span> <span id="s582">My aunt experienced a very tragic loss of her husband and she also lost her business that had to be built up from scratch.</span> <span id="s583">And then all of a sudden, I come in, in addition to her problems and -- financial and personal ones.</span> <span id="s584">And I myself needed love and I guess peaceful surroundings.</span> <span id="s585">And unfortunately that couldn’t happen because of the circumstances.</span> <span id="s586">It was very difficult for everyone.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: She was working every day?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: Yes, oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: So she would leave in the morning?</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: Well, she would leave and after a little while, I would go to work with her and I became sort of a cashier.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: I mean, that’s about the only thing I could do because I didn’t speak the language.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: And I mean, numbers, you know, taking the payments, at that time, you know, people always -- not always, but they -- there were no credit cards, they had -- you bought something, you paid a down payment and then you made so many payments, you know, for a year or whatever.</span> <span id="s595">And I would do that in the -- in the store, in the office.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s597">Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: And so we would go.</span> <span id="s599">And also in the very beginning, my aunt did an admirable deed.</span> <span id="s600">She threw me into school.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: Right away?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: Right away.</span> <span id="s603">And I -- I didn’t speak -- I spoke many other languages, but I didn’t speak any English.</span> <span id="s604">And I cannot understand why I didn’t start learning English while I was waiting to go, you know, to emigrate, but I didn’t.</span> <span id="s605">And I came, as I said, I think the 25th of June, and after the Fourth of July holiday, I was attending night classes at Columbus Central High.</span> <span id="s606">And there again I was like a wild animal, because I didn’t speak a word of English.</span> <span id="s607">And -- but you know, it was the best thing that happened to me.</span> <span id="s608">And I attended these classes until September and by then I went to Ohio State.</span> <span id="s609">And by that time I spoke some English and again, they were very helpful.</span> <span id="s610">They gave me a tutor, for no money.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: And I entered Ohio State with a third grade education.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: It was the best thing for me, but I worked in the daytime and I attended school at night.</span> <span id="s615">And life was very difficult for my aunt, for me, for Rosalie, for the rest of the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: Tell me about how many aunts and cousins and what kind of -- what was the size of this family you were moving into?</span> <span id="s617">I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: -- were they a close family?</span> <span id="s620">Did they spend time together, and you know, what kind of --</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: -- if you want to talk about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: But I’m just trying to get a sense of --</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: -- here you are, you don’t know anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s628">And I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: And what were you -- what kind of world were you coming in to?</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: Well, it was like I was coming from Mars.</span> <span id="s631">And part of it was my fault.</span> <span id="s632">But I had so much pain and so much hurt.</span> <span id="s633">I needed caressing and I needed love and understanding.</span> <span id="s634">And they, my family, in return needed some guidance too.</span> <span id="s635">How to treat me, and -- you know, ho-how to react to me.</span> <span id="s636">And it didn’t come freely on either side.</span> <span id="s637">In retrospect, it must have been terribly difficult for them, but it was also extremely difficult for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: Were you in -- now that you’ve had these years to look back, what was your behavior like?</span> <span id="s639">Were you angry, were you short with people?</span> <span id="s640">Were you --</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: No, I kept it all --</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: -- what were you like, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: -- within me, and when -- on the way to school, I would cry.</span> <span id="s644">When I was alone I would cry and I wasn’t alone, I didn’t have any privacy, none whatsoever.</span> <span id="s645">But that was out of my -- I -- I -- there was nothing I could do about that.</span> <span id="s646">And my aunt was so good and so caring --</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: I’m sorry, we’re going to have to change tapes.</span> <span id="s648">Hold that thought.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: This is tape two, side one, Charlene Schiff.</span> <span id="s651">Okay, your aunt was very caring.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: Yeah, she was so caring and she was so full of love, and yet she was so hurt herself.</span> <span id="s653">I didn’t know -- didn’t know how to comfort her, and it f -- it almost felt that I should comfort her, and it was sort of a mutual thing, but then there was my cousin Rosalie.</span> <span id="s654">She was hurt because I was taking away part of her mother’s love, which was hers.</span> <span id="s655">And then all of a sudden she had to share it with a stranger, and I was a stranger in every way.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: And she had lost her father, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: And she had just lost her father and she was a very -- she was the only chi -- girl in that family, so her father both, and her mother adored her.</span> <span id="s658">And she was sort of lost, too.</span> <span id="s659">She needed comforting.</span> <span id="s660">And my poor aunt was torn.</span> <span id="s661">And it was very, very difficult.</span> <span id="s662">But to answer your question about the family, as it happened, the four other sisters of my father all lived in New York.</span> <span id="s663">And all of -- all the f -- the four sisters were married and each one had children.</span> <span id="s664">I became closest with Aunt Belka’s daughter, she had only one daughter, Rosalie also -- popular name in my family -- and her fiancé, Stanley.</span> <span id="s665">And they -- eventually they -- they did marry, I think the same year.</span> <span id="s666">I became close with them because they were the ones who first greeted me when I first came here.</span> <span id="s667">Then there was -- there was Aunt Belka, then there was Aunt Anya -- Anna, actually.</span> <span id="s668">She had two children, Toby and Jeff.</span> <span id="s669">And then there was Aunt Ida, and she had three children, another Rosalie, Henry and Joe.</span> <span id="s670">So how many do we have now?</span> <span id="s671">Ida, Anya -- Anna -- Ida, Anna, Belka --</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: Bertha.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: Bertha.</span> <span id="s674">I’m missing one.</span> <span id="s675">Be five.</span> <span id="s676">Sarah.</span> <span id="s677">Aunt Sarah was the oldest of my father’s sisters and she had two children, Joe and Millie.</span> <span id="s678">Millie is still alive.</span> <span id="s679">Millie must be now about 80 years old or so.</span> <span id="s680">She is the daughter of the oldest aunt.</span> <span id="s681">But I was not very close with them because they were all in New York and they did not exchange frequent visits to Columbus.</span> <span id="s682">So basically the family would get together for different occasions like weddings, or Bar and Bat Mitzvahs, which I never knew about because this was a new happening for me, a new experience in the United States.</span> <span id="s683">But I was closest with my Aunt Bertha with whom I lived, who opened her home and heart to me and gave me unconditional love.</span> <span id="s684">Unconditional love.</span> <span id="s685">And her children, she had three children.</span> <span id="s686">She had two sons, Marty, the oldest and Bobby.</span> <span id="s687">Bobby is now in L.A..</span> <span id="s688">He became an engineer and migrated, I think, a year or so after I came to the States.</span> <span id="s689">Marty married and stayed in business with my aunt.</span> <span id="s690">And Rosalie was still a teenager.</span> <span id="s691">So I became -- and then there was -- also, there were some other relatives in Columbus.</span> <span id="s692">There was an Aunt Dora, and these were -- most of them were related to my Uncle Lieber.</span> <span id="s693">And they were very social, and I mean that’s the way the family conducted itself.</span> <span id="s694">I mean, there were many parties and things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: So they kept you in their --</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A: In -- yeah, but I --</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: -- in their [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s698">A: -- in the beginning I had no social life.</span> <span id="s699">Couldn’t speak English, and Rosalie was younger than I, and she had her own group.</span> <span id="s700">And usually when she and her childr -- her -- her friends would come, I’d go to the basement.</span> <span id="s701">There was a basement in the apartment.</span> <span id="s702">It was difficult.</span> <span id="s703">It was very difficult.</span> <span id="s704">My studies were progressing, I did quite well.</span> <span id="s705">I wanted so badly to become Americanized.</span> <span id="s706">And I was attending school and I did very well there, and I was still, you know, working at the store part-time.</span> <span id="s707">And my aunt tried her best to be my friend and to be my -- my healer, in a way.</span> <span id="s708">But it was difficult.</span> <span id="s709">And then there was once -- and a -- I -- my social life was not very active, but I started -- I wasn’t dating, but I saw this young man, and at that time I was very, very naïve, I didn’t know anything.</span> <span id="s710">And I was meeting him there after school or so -- or before, because I was going in the evening.</span> <span id="s711">And now it comes out, I think, the only reason he dated me, he was majoring in Russian.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: He wanted to speak with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: And for me to help him in Russian.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: Oh [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: And so that -- there was no romantic in -- you know, involvement.</span> <span id="s716">But there was once a party, and the party was an Ohio State party, you know.</span> <span id="s717">I-I was -- I did belong to Hillel, but that was not from Hillel, was just a party, and a lot of the kids who came to the party, also there were some alumni who came.</span> <span id="s718">And my husband had cousins in Columbus, twins.</span> <span id="s719">They were dentists.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: Your future husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: My future husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: Right, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: Yeah, th -- he had cousins and they were twins and they were both dentists and they were both alumni of Ohio State.</span> <span id="s724">As a matter of fact, they were my family’s dentists.</span> <span id="s725">But they came to that party because they were alumni of Ohio State, and at that time my f -- my future husband visited them, and they brought him along.</span> <span id="s726">And that’s the way I met my husband.</span> <span id="s727">I was playing hard to get.</span> <span id="s728">My husband is older than I am, but if I would line up a million men right now, I couldn’t have picked a better husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: When you were at that party and you were introduced to him by someone, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: Did you hit it off right away --</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: -- or did he see something --</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: He did, he kept pursuing me and calling me and I played hard to get.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: For how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: About three, four months.</span> <span id="s737">He was from New York and he came from a family, very nice family, he has one sister, and he had parents, obviously.</span> <span id="s738">He was in the military, he enlisted in the military when second World War started.</span> <span id="s739">And when the war ended, he got out.</span> <span id="s740">And he was sort of at loose ends, he didn’t know what to do with himself.</span> <span id="s741">He didn’t have a college education, so he started going to school and trying to see what he can do with himself.</span> <span id="s742">He had some kind of a job at that time in New York, but I don’t know why, but he came to visit, and look around, maybe he was going to go to Ohio State or whatever.</span> <span id="s743">And he came to visit his cousins and it was, as they say in French [indecipherable], I guess.</span> <span id="s744">But once we started dating, and our first date was around Thanksgiving, we knew -- I knew that this is what I wanted and I needed.</span> <span id="s745">And he has been blind since then, and doesn’t see any of my faults, and I’m forever grateful.</span> <span id="s746">He is the best thing that could have happened to me at any time, but especially then.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: His name?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: Ed.</span> <span id="s749">But his actual name is Erwin, E-r-w-i-n, which I don’t particularly like, because when I say Erwin, I think of Erwin Rommel, the German general.</span> <span id="s750">So everyone calls him Ed.</span> <span id="s751">His -- his mother was German, she came from Germany.</span> <span id="s752">And her parents are his -- my husband’s grandfather, Grandpa Harkavy was a cigar manufacturer for the Kaiser in Germany.</span> <span id="s753">And they both, Baubi and Zedi Harkavy they come from the famous Harkavys who -- some of these relatives were writing -- have written a prayer book, you know, for -- you know, for services and all.</span> <span id="s754">But he -- Zedi Harkavy had a -- as I said, a f -- a ma -- manufactured cigars for the Kaiser.</span> <span id="s755">And when I was introduced to Baubi and Zedi, and my husb -- my future husband said, you know, that I came from Europe and I was a Holocaust survivor, I don’t think that they realized or wanted to believe that anything could have happened in their beloved Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: Pardon me, but were they Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: They were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: And when did they come to the U.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: I’m not quite sure.</span> <span id="s762">A long time ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: Well before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: Oh yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">A: But my -- my mother-in-law, may she rest in peace, had one sister and her parents, but she -- they still spoke German occasionally with her sister.</span> <span id="s767">And that was difficult for me, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Q: Yeah, I bet.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: But you were in Columbus?</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">Q: And they were in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q: So you weren’t seeing them on a regular basis.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A: No, I wasn’t, and -- but that -- by the time we decide -- not by the time, actually we thought -- we didn’t set a date for the marriage, for getting married, but as it happened, my husband was -- my future husband was in the reserves at that time, and he didn’t know if he was going to go back to school.</span> <span id="s776">He didn’t know what he really wanted.</span> <span id="s777">But we decided to get married and we didn’t set a date.</span> <span id="s778">And then the -- I think -- I don’t recall exactly, but I think the problem started with Korea, and he knew he was going to get called back because he was in the reserves.</span> <span id="s779">And so we did decide to get married.</span> <span id="s780">The date of our wedding was set not by me.</span> <span id="s781">My mother-in-law and father-in-law and my husband’s grandparents on both sides, I think -- I know at least on one side, were married April 15th.</span> <span id="s782">And it was decided that E-Ed and I would get married April 15th.</span> <span id="s783">I did not have anything to contribute to that.</span> <span id="s784">The wedding was supposed to have been in Columbus, Ohio, my aunt was going to do that.</span> <span id="s785">But, at the last minute it -- the wedding took place in New York.</span> <span id="s786">My mother-in-law decided that Grandpa and Grandma Harkavy couldn’t travel, and the wedding had to be in New York.</span> <span id="s787">We got married --</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Q: Was your aunt able to come from Columbus?</span></p> <p><span id="s789">A: Oh yes, oh yes, yes, she came and some of the family.</span> <span id="s790">The aunts, my father’s sisters came.</span> <span id="s791">The wedding was in Franklin square in the s -- what is it, community center or something.</span> <span id="s792">And the rabbi who married us, I didn’t know him from beans, he was my mother-in-law’s rabbi.</span> <span id="s793">My husband -- at that time my husband to be didn’t have much to say about that either and we got married, and that was wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q: Was this April after you met in November?</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: So, like six months later.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s798">We would have waited longer, but with the war -- it was, I guess, the Korea incident at that time.</span> <span id="s799">Well, sure enough, we were married April 15th, I’m not going to say what year, I’ll tell you later on.</span> <span id="s800">And May 12th my husband was called back onto active duty.</span> <span id="s801">He knew he was going to be called back.</span> <span id="s802">And his first assignment was Germany.</span> <span id="s803">And that did not sit very well with me and I guess I must have been a feminist way, way back, because even then I said, I’m not going.</span> <span id="s804">And so I -- at that time also my studies were interrupted because I had -- I-I wanted -- I said I’m going to join you, you go.</span> <span id="s805">I mean, he had to go.</span> <span id="s806">But I’ll join you when I become an American citizen.</span> <span id="s807">Not that I wanted to go back to Germany anyway.</span> <span id="s808">And so I had to wait a year, but it was easier and shorter to go to New York to become a -- a citizen than in Columbus for some reason, I don’t understand why.</span> <span id="s809">So I went and stayed with my in-laws until I beca -- and I -- I got a job at a candy store, a chocolate store, you know, while I was waiting.</span> <span id="s810">And my f -- my father-in-law, may he rest in peace, was a wonderful person.</span> <span id="s811">He accepted -- accepted me when my husband -- my future husband introduced me.</span> <span id="s812">He used to call me toots.</span> <span id="s813">And he said, toots, welcome to the family.</span> <span id="s814">And a -- a -- what -- yeah, if he -- if -- if, you know, Ed decided, and what he decides is good enough for me and gave me a big bear hug and he was a doll.</span> <span id="s815">He lived til 103.</span> <span id="s816">Oh, he was a f -- a wonderful person, I loved him.</span> <span id="s817">He was such a wonderful person.</span> <span id="s818">Did everything wrong and yet he lived til 103.</span> <span id="s819">He -- when he would come he would give me his orders.</span> <span id="s820">He liked steak and he liked a schnapps at night and he liked coffee, but actually it wasn’t coffee and it wasn’t half and half.</span> <span id="s821">It was heavy cream, about three quarters of the cup and then a little bit of coffee.</span> <span id="s822">And the steak, h-he said, don’t trim the fat, because that’s the best part.</span> <span id="s823">But he lived til 103.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s826">A wonderful man.</span> <span id="s827">But anyway, I stayed with my in-laws and became an American citizen and then I went to join my husband in Germany.</span> <span id="s828">This time when I came back to Germany as an American citizen, it was a lot different than living in DP camps.</span> <span id="s829">We went with my hu --</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q: Can I ask you a question before we go back to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">Q: Just what was it like in New York, and maybe even in Ohio?</span> <span id="s833">Did you know other survivors and -- and how are you generally regarded or considered?</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A: I was regarded as a -- like in a zoo, what do you call it, when there’s something strange or different.</span> <span id="s835">I was not regarded as a -- a regular human being.</span> <span id="s836">That’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: You felt like an outsider all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">A: Always, yes.</span> <span id="s839">Oh yes, I have.</span> <span id="s840">And yes, I --</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: In New York too?</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A: Oh, well first of all, they lived on the island, they lived in Franklin square, my in-laws, and I --</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: I don’t know where that is.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: It’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: The island meaning?</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: The island meaning Long Island.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: Long Island, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s849">I do -- I don’t know in New York really, myself.</span> <span id="s850">That’s where they lived and all I knew, in the morning I would go into -- I think it was Hampstead or West Hampstead, to go to work.</span> <span id="s851">Lufts, it was called, it was a -- like a -- like Bartons or so, it was chocolates, you know.</span> <span id="s852">And I would go to work and then I would go back at night.</span> <span id="s853">I didn’t go to school then or anything.</span> <span id="s854">Just waiting and studying for my exam, you know, to become a citizen.</span> <span id="s855">It’s pretty -- it was pretty -- not difficult, but it was a lot.</span> <span id="s856">You had to learn history and -- you know.</span> <span id="s857">But, you know, I passed and everything was fine.</span> <span id="s858">So I didn’t have any social life at that time either.</span> <span id="s859">And by that time I was married and I couldn’t care less, you know?</span> <span id="s860">I would write to my husband and -- almost daily and so did he.</span> <span id="s861">And when the time came, when I became an American citizen, I went back to Germany to join my husband.</span> <span id="s862">Now this is probably -- I don’t know how to express it, but becoming a wife of an officer -- o-o-of an ar -- of a -- of a military person, was the most important, wonderful thing that could have happened to me when I came to the United States.</span> <span id="s863">Why?</span> <span id="s864">Because all of a sudden I was part of a group.</span> <span id="s865">I finally belonged.</span> <span id="s866">I was a wife of a military person.</span> <span id="s867">And the military wives and all, accept you unconditionally, without reservations, without questions, you are one of them, and they take care of you.</span> <span id="s868">And I did not experience anything like this until I married my husband, and until -- I mean, he wi -- became part of the military.</span> <span id="s869">And of course at that time it was also, ah, a nice Jewish guy, what is he doing in the military, you know?</span> <span id="s870">But at that point, and that’s also like -- almost like a Domino effect, my husband went to Germany and he was to serve there three years and then he would be out again, because he was in the reserves.</span> <span id="s871">But in order, since I didn’t go with him, so it was a year or so before I became a citizen, an American citizen and was going to join him, so by that time he only had two years or so.</span> <span id="s872">And the military isn’t stupid.</span> <span id="s873">They said, well, if you -- if you want to bring your wife over, you have to sign up for three more years.</span> <span id="s874">Yeah.</span> <span id="s875">Or something like that, I mean I’m -- I’m not quite sure.</span> <span id="s876">But anyway, so my husband had to sign up for another three years to serve in order to bring me to Germany.</span> <span id="s877">We -- we got some housing and all, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: Where were you in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s879">A: We were in -- outside of Munich.</span> <span id="s880">Ramersdorf, it’s -- it’s -- it was a post outside of Munich.</span> <span id="s881">And that -- at that time, you know, I became part of the military and we had meetings and I mean, there were so many things to do and you had to entertain and I didn’t know how to boil water.</span> <span id="s882">And there’s one thing my mother-in-law did that I really, at the time, like everything else, I didn’t appreciate, but she did a very nice thing.</span> <span id="s883">For the first Hanukkah after we got married, my mother-in-law gave me a cookbook and rightly so, cause I didn’t know, as I say, how to boil water.</span> <span id="s884">She was a magnificent hostess.</span> <span id="s885">She -- and there was a large family, they -- my father-in-law was one of 12, and my mother-in-law had a small family, but they lived again -- also, after they moved from Franklin square, they moved to a very fancy place on the island with property on the water, right on the water and she entertained beautifully, and she -- people would come and visit like, you know, Sunday morning, she’d say why -- why don’t you stay for dinner.</span> <span id="s886">And, you know, by the time she’d look around she’d have 25 people for dinner.</span> <span id="s887">And she would just do it as, you know, talking to you or me.</span> <span id="s888">And I couldn’t do anything like that.</span> <span id="s889">But anyway, she gave me this book and I was offended, but I really needed it because I didn’t know how to cook and how to entertain.</span> <span id="s890">But when we did go to Germany, there were many obligations, you know, I had to entertain and -- and we did get together, there was a lot of social activity, and I was part of a group.</span> <span id="s891">And even though I hated being in Germany, and I mean, there were many instances where I never let on that I spoke German.</span> <span id="s892">And so many -- once my husband’s sister came to visit and we went in, she wanted to buy some gifts.</span> <span id="s893">And there’s this fashionable -- they still wear them, they call them lederhosen, you know, the short -- she wanted to buy some.</span> <span id="s894">We went into a shop and this salesgirl, you know, was yelling back, and she says, these are Ammies, you know, Americans.</span> <span id="s895">How much do I -- you know, what kind of price do I quote them?</span> <span id="s896">And they yelled back, telling them, you know, how much to ask, cause things were not marked.</span> <span id="s897">And then in my purest holk-deutsch I answered that if the price is different for the Ammies, we are not buying here.</span> <span id="s898">And we walked out, you know.</span> <span id="s899">That gave me great satisfaction.</span> <span id="s900">And I mean, there were many instances, you know, there that they didn’t like the Americans even though we, you know, with the Marshall plan and everything, we did so much for the Germans, they still resent -- that’s probably why they resented us.</span> <span id="s901">And you would go and you would see signs, Ammie go home, you know.</span> <span id="s902">And that was in the 50’s, but that’s the way it was.</span> <span id="s903">But anyway, I was almo -- I mean, I was -- I was becoming a different person, and it was very good for me.</span> <span id="s904">And so my husband signed up for three more years and by that time we came home and we ended up in several places, I can’t remember where.</span> <span id="s905">I should remember.</span> <span id="s906">But anyway, we finally did have a son.</span> <span id="s907">And that was also after very difficult circumstances and this -- I call him my miracle baby, we only have one son.</span> <span id="s908">And our lives changed and it was wonderful.</span> <span id="s909">My husband was traveling quite a bit and many times he had to go on duty without me, obviously.</span> <span id="s910">And so I had to learn, you know, how to do things for myself and all.</span> <span id="s911">But life was good.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">Q: What year was your son born?</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A: He was born in 1956, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s914">Q: And you were in the States then?</span></p> <p><span id="s915">A: When he was born, yes.</span> <span id="s916">I had a very difficult pregnancy.</span> <span id="s917">And I remember the doctor who took care of me in the military.</span> <span id="s918">He was born at Fort Lee, Virginia and no matter where he was going to school since then, he was always referred to as the boy from the south.</span> <span id="s919">But the doctor who took care of me, the obstetrician was getting out of the service, and he promised me that he’ll stay on, even a -- you know, if I don’t deliver on the date that, you know, he was -- actually had to get out like a week before my scheduled delivery and he said he would stay on to see me through because I had a difficult pregnancy, and he did.</span> <span id="s920">And he said that the child would be born on September 22nd and he was born on September 22nd.</span> <span id="s921">But I went to the hospital three times before, you know?</span> <span id="s922">And I remember my husband was so excited that when th-the child finally arrived and he was coming to the hospital, he had a box of cigars, you know, to hand out, he spilled them all over the place.</span> <span id="s923">But those were very good years.</span> <span id="s924">And then came Vietnam.</span> <span id="s925">And -- yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s926">Q: Your husband was still in the military?</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A: Well, after the three years that he signed up, then he came back and he didn’t have a college education or anything and he decided to stay on.</span> <span id="s928">So he signed up for another three years.</span> <span id="s929">And by that time it was already nine years or so, so he stayed on and he got his education too.</span> <span id="s930">He worked at night and got his undergraduate degree and then later on he got graduate degree, all while he was in the military.</span> <span id="s931">By that time he decided to make the military a career cause he s -- put in too much time into the military.</span> <span id="s932">And he -- actually he rose -- he became a full colonel, you know, later on.</span> <span id="s933">But -- and that --</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Q: Let me -- we’re almost out o -- on this side, let me turn this over before -- End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s935">A: Is it on now?</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s937">This is tape two, side two, interview with Charlene Schiff.</span> <span id="s938">It’s the late 50’s now, your husband has decided to make the military a full career.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">A: Yes, bec --</span></p> <p><span id="s940">Q: And your son is a small --</span></p> <p><span id="s941">A: Boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q: -- small boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">Q: And you’re where -- living where?</span></p> <p><span id="s945">A: We were living -- in ’56 we were living at -- living at Fort Lee, Virginia, which is just about I don’t know how many miles outside -- south of Richmond, Virginia.</span> <span id="s946">And our son was born with some kind of a -- can I close this [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Q: Sure, just -- just start over.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">A: Well, our son was only three months old when my husband got or-orders -- received orders to go to Japan.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">A: And the entire family was outraged.</span> <span id="s951">You’re going to take a little baby to Japan, in the wilderness?</span> <span id="s952">Well anyway, we did go to Japan.</span> <span id="s953">Our son was only three months old.</span> <span id="s954">When he was born there was something a little bit -- that needed a doctor’s opinion and care.</span> <span id="s955">And I don’t know if you’ve ever heard of a famous doctor from Pennsylvania, University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, he became the Surgeon General.</span> <span id="s956">Can’t remember his name, it’s terrible.</span> <span id="s957">But he’s a famous doctor and he became the Surgeon General and now he’s a -- an activist.</span> <span id="s958">He had a little beard, he’s usually in the news.</span> <span id="s959">Isn’t it terrible, I can’t remember his name.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: Koop?</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: Koop.</span> <span id="s962">Dr. Koop, yeah.</span> <span id="s963">Dr. Koop was recommended to us, I mean, that we should see Dr. Koop with this little problem.</span> <span id="s964">And Dr. Koop, to see Dr. Koop you had to wait six to eight months to see him at that time, he was so busy.</span> <span id="s965">And we were at Fort Lee.</span> <span id="s966">Well somehow, through a friend of a friend, Dr. Koop saw us right away, because we were going to go to --</span></p> <p><span id="s967">Q: Japan.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">A: -- Japan.</span> <span id="s969">And usually, I don’t know how much he o -- he charged, but being that my husband was military, and an officer, a young officer -- I mean, a junior officer, he charged us only 10 dollars to see our son.</span> <span id="s970">And he gave us the prognosis and he told us what to do and thank God everything turned out better than perfect.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">Q: Before we go to Japan, let me ask you sort of in a summary kind of way --</span></p> <p><span id="s972">A: Mm-hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s973">Q: -- you’ve been in now -- in the States almost 10 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: Just about 10 years.</span> <span id="s976">You’ve bi --</span></p> <p><span id="s977">A: Not quite, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">Q: Not quite 10 years, but you’re married, you have a child, you’ve been overseas, you --</span></p> <p><span id="s979">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">Q: How -- an-and you said in the beginning when you first started talking about your husband how understanding he was, how comforting he was to you at such a difficult time, but those first 10 years, how do you exp -- how -- h-how was it that he was able to understand, do you think, what you needed and what you had to --</span></p> <p><span id="s981">A: Because --</span></p> <p><span id="s982">Q: Could he understand what you had been through?</span></p> <p><span id="s983">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Q: And did you find it easy to talk to him --</span></p> <p><span id="s985">A: Yes, yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Q: -- and tell him what --</span></p> <p><span id="s987">A: -- yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">Q: He knew everything --</span></p> <p><span id="s989">A: Yes, yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s990">Q: -- about what had happened to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s991">A: -- everything --</span></p> <p><span id="s992">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">A: -- everything.</span> <span id="s994">As a matter of fact, before we became engaged, I -- we ha -- we s -- we had -- we sat up a whole night and I told him, and I said, do you still want me?</span> <span id="s995">And, you know, he -- he is just a very -- again, I was so lucky.</span> <span id="s996">He’s a very special person, he has a big heart, and he -- he should have been probably a psychiatrist, I guess, because first of all he is very, very sharp, and he -- he has the understanding and he knows how to approach you and how to make you feel good about yourself.</span> <span id="s997">And there isn’t a day t-til today that he doesn’t tell me 10 times that he loves me and I am the most beautiful creature in the whole world.</span> <span id="s998">I said, I just hope he continues being blind for the rest of his life.</span> <span id="s999">And even when he was so ill -- you know, he was very ill and I don’t want to go into it, but even when he was so ill, his main concern was not to be a burden to me.</span> <span id="s1000">So, I mean he -- somehow he has the right combination of making me feel like I’m the Queen of Sheba.</span> <span id="s1001">I mean, I-I’m -- I’m really something, I’m important and he understands what I went through, or he -- if he doesn’t understand 100 percent, he tells me with his love and with his actions that he does.</span> <span id="s1002">And he makes me -- I -- I -- I can tell him anything and everything.</span> <span id="s1003">And he is soft and wonderful.</span> <span id="s1004">And yet, as a soldier and all, he was hard and he was decisive and -- and he was mean when he had to be mean, but he has never been mean to me.</span> <span id="s1005">And I’m a very difficult person to live with, maybe part of it because of what I went through, but I -- I am difficult, and I know it.</span> <span id="s1006">And sometimes I would start an argument, and the most frustrating thing is, he never answers.</span> <span id="s1007">He doesn’t want to argue.</span> <span id="s1008">He doesn’t want to have an argument.</span> <span id="s1009">And a -- it’s sometimes exasperating to me, but he doesn’t want to argue with me.</span> <span id="s1010">He says he had enough arguments.</span> <span id="s1011">And, you know, so he -- he just -- he’s just a very special person.</span> <span id="s1012">And a -- a -- I’ve been just very, very fortunate.</span> <span id="s1013">And I think he got most of all this from his father.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">A: Cause his father was a very gentle person, a very loving person, a very caring person.</span> <span id="s1016">He was one of 12.</span> <span id="s1017">I don’t know how many ended up here in the United States and all, but most of them, not all of them, have done extremely well financially.</span> <span id="s1018">Not my father-in-law.</span> <span id="s1019">He was actually a builder, you know.</span> <span id="s1020">But money and my father-in-law just didn’t go hand in hand.</span> <span id="s1021">It always went away from him.</span> <span id="s1022">I mean, he made a living, but nothing extraordinary.</span> <span id="s1023">And yet, during the war he had a big garden and after work and all he would come -- he was always a hard worker, and he would, you know, grow all these wonderful vegetables and everything.</span> <span id="s1024">And on Sundays the whole family, the real rich ones, you know, who could afford anything and everything would come and load their cars with all the garden vegetables and fruits that my father-in-law worked on.</span> <span id="s1025">And they wouldn’t even say thank you.</span> <span id="s1026">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">Q: Were you and your husband religious?</span> <span id="s1028">Did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1030">There again, when I -- when the war ended, I was angry and disappointed and hateful and I lost my faith.</span> <span id="s1031">I always say I’ve had one-sided di -- a one-sided dialog with God, cause he never answered.</span> <span id="s1032">And I felt almost abandoned by God.</span> <span id="s1033">Our background -- I -- I don’t know what I said in my oral history before, but I think I probably said that we weren’t kosher.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">Q: You did mention that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">A: I did.</span> <span id="s1036">I think we were kosher, but -- at home, but when we would go out, I think -- or, you know, there weren’t that many restaurants, but in -- in Lvov, I mean was a big city, my father would allow us to have a sandwich with chicken, and I know it wasn’t kosher, you know, so I -- you know, we were religious at home, but not as Orthodox as most other people.</span> <span id="s1037">My father never wore a yarmulke un-unless he went to shul.</span> <span id="s1038">So when -- now I was sort of at loose ends, I think, and when I came to Columbus, there were the rituals; Friday night, and my aunt would go to shul on Saturday -- not every Saturday -- and the holidays were observed, you know, with traditional food and traditional whatever else there was.</span> <span id="s1039">But when I married my husband we had a tradition -- a tradition -- we had a -- a religious mar --</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">Q: Service [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">A: -- wedding, yeah.</span> <span id="s1042">And we always belonged -- in the military we always belonged to the chapel, to the Jewish chapel.</span> <span id="s1043">And again, it wasn’t something that my husband would, you know, use the what do you call them, the Tefillin, you know, he wouldn’t do that.</span> <span id="s1044">But we preserved the traditional way of observance, I suppose.</span> <span id="s1045">And then something happened in 1985.</span> <span id="s1046">I don’t know, am I ready for that?</span> <span id="s1047">Not yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">Q: Well, we’re jumping ahead a little bit, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">A: Yeah, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">Q: -- if you think it’s relevant here, it’s [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A: Well, i-it’s relevant to th -- because that’s when I regained my faith --</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">Q: Oh right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">A: -- completely, yeah.</span> <span id="s1054">But I started regaining my faith when my son was born.</span> <span id="s1055">And also, it was very important to both of us that our son get a very thorough Jewish education.</span> <span id="s1056">That was very important to us.</span> <span id="s1057">And it started with the birth of our son, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1059">Well, we’ll come back to that later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">Q: Because I think it -- it’ll be interesting to talk about in -- in relation to your decision to speak out, too, in those times.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">A: Yeah, i-it’s all sort of --</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1064">Let’s -- yeah.</span> <span id="s1065">So let’s go sort of chronologically --</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">A: So where are we now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">Q: We’re -- you’re going to Japan.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1069">Well, we’re going to Japan.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">A: And again, I know my daughter-in-law, God bless her, sh-she’s a nurse -- my -- my husband -- my husb -- my son is a doctor, so who else would he marry?</span> <span id="s1072">A nurse.</span> <span id="s1073">But -- because it takes a special person to understand a doctor, you know.</span> <span id="s1074">But anyway, she -- when she sometimes hears about -- listens to our conversations now she says, I could never be a military wife.</span> <span id="s1075">And I can see that, you know, but for me, again, I think I said it before, it was the best thing that ever happened to me.</span> <span id="s1076">But I had to learn -- well, I didn’t have to, because I was used to it, but you have to take the bitter with the sweet.</span> <span id="s1077">Going to Japan was an -- an occasion for us very exciting, but the whole, the entire family, mine and my husband’s was very much against it.</span> <span id="s1078">I mean, they voiced their opinion.</span> <span id="s1079">You’re taking a little babela, a little baby to the wilderness, you know.</span> <span id="s1080">Well anyway, we set out to go to Japan.</span> <span id="s1081">We had to go to the state of Washington, I don’t know where we left from, someplace there.</span> <span id="s1082">It was a military place and that’s where we went.</span> <span id="s1083">And what happens usually w -- in the military, and especially when you have a child, when you go overseas -- at that time we didn’t have much in -- as far as furniture and all, but we had a little bit of stuff.</span> <span id="s1084">And so when the packers came to pack us -- they call it hold luggage, hold baggage and regular baggage.</span> <span id="s1085">The hold baggage is supposed to come right after you arrive in the new country, cause that’s the stuff that you cannot do without.</span> <span id="s1086">So what could I not do without?</span> <span id="s1087">I needed a crib, I needed diapers, and in those days you had diaper that you had to wash, and all the things that I needed for my son, right, and a few things for us.</span> <span id="s1088">And -- and that’s the way it -- so that was our hold luggage and the rest was going to come later.</span> <span id="s1089">When we -- well, first of all, we boarded -- is that what you call it, boarded a-a -- the ship, and right away the military has their own way.</span> <span id="s1090">So, it was in the winter time when we went, and my husband was called to duty on the ship, to be with the troops, downst -- down there in the -- in the deep whatever you call it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q: In the hold, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">A: In the hold, yeah.</span> <span id="s1093">And Stephen, our son, and I, the three month old baby and I were someplace else upstair -- up in a little cabin, a very small cabin.</span> <span id="s1094">The weather was so bad that they had to tie the mil -- th-the little thing that they had for my son -- it wasn’t really a crib, but some kind of a thing because it was going back and forth.</span> <span id="s1095">And me, I got sick, you know, again.</span> <span id="s1096">And my s -- my husband was down with the troops, so we had no care except for the people who, you know, care for you, th-the waiters or whatever you call them.</span> <span id="s1097">And this was a military ship, so we had some nurses and all.</span> <span id="s1098">By the time we got to Japan, I mean, I couldn’t wait to see the ground, to feel the ground, you know, under my feet.</span> <span id="s1099">And as a -- as we came, my husband at that time was already a specialist in petroleum, you know, all the oils and all the petroleum for the cars and for the airplanes.</span> <span id="s1100">And at that time he was in charge of the petroleum for all Japan.</span> <span id="s1101">And we came in, there was no housing for us.</span> <span id="s1102">Usually there is, but there wasn’t.</span> <span id="s1103">They needed him right away.</span> <span id="s1104">And we were assigned a house on a depot, the only house there.</span> <span id="s1105">So there I come with my little boy in a house with no other houses around.</span> <span id="s1106">And I was assigned a little Japanese girl to help me, like a little maid.</span> <span id="s1107">Lovely young lady.</span> <span id="s1108">She didn’t speak English and I didn’t speak Japanese.</span> <span id="s1109">And the water had to be boiled and we had to put Clorox in it because it wasn’t safe in those days.</span> <span id="s1110">And our hold baggage didn’t come.</span> <span id="s1111">So it was a very hard first year.</span> <span id="s1112">And my husband when he -- we finally arrived in Japan, he was called t -- mine -- to -- to be in charge of a big petroleum lab which was near Yakuska.</span> <span id="s1113">We -- I was in Yokohama, he was in Yakuska, and then there was a little island by itself and that’s where the big lab was, and my husband had to go there.</span> <span id="s1114">So for the first year I hardly saw him.</span> <span id="s1115">And the thing that really scared me, I mean you learn and you do, you know, what you have to do, and the baby was being cleaned and all with water that we had to boil and we had to put Clorox in.</span> <span id="s1116">And my little helper would come every day and we sort of, you know, communicated.</span> <span id="s1117">And she had to go and buy me diapers in a Japanese place, and we had to get a crib from somewhere.</span> <span id="s1118">And somehow we, you know, managed.</span> <span id="s1119">But the funny thing was, she has never eaten white bread.</span> <span id="s1120">[coughs].</span> <span id="s1121">Excuse me.</span> <span id="s1122">She was used to a diet of rice.</span> <span id="s1123">[coughs].</span> <span id="s1124">And -- sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">Q: It’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">A: And when she came to me, I mean, once a month I could write out an order and the commissary would deliver it to me.</span> <span id="s1127">When -- you know, because my husband wasn’t around.</span> <span id="s1128">We didn't have a car or anything.</span> <span id="s1129">So when she was introduced to white bread, I was using a loaf of bread almost daily because she just loved the white bread, which you know, was fine.</span> <span id="s1130">And she was very anxious to come and work with me because of the white bread.</span> <span id="s1131">Nothing else appealed to her as much as white bread.</span> <span id="s1132">But anyway, Formikasan was her name.</span> <span id="s1133">Very lovely young girl.</span> <span id="s1134">We wanted to bring her back with us when our time was to come home from Japan.</span> <span id="s1135">But to show you -- and there I’m mixing apples and oranges, but to show you what a custom they have in these countries, in Japan, for instance, she was one, I think of six, but she was the oldest daughter, the oldest child in the family, and she wouldn’t go with -- I mean, we told her, if you come with us to America, you’ll have a better life, you know, you’ll go out and do, you know, what you want to do.</span> <span id="s1136">She -- by that time she learned English a little bit, and she wanted to go to America badly, but she, being the eldest in the family, sh -- it was her assignment, her task to take care of her parents.</span> <span id="s1137">So she couldn’t -- unless we would take her parents, and of course we couldn’t do that.</span> <span id="s1138">Now, coming back to Japan.</span> <span id="s1139">For the first year, was very difficult, but our son thrived and he gained weight, and it -- you know, for me it was a full time -- full time and a half of -- of, you know, taking care of him, and without my husband’s help and in a strange country without knowing the language and the customs.</span> <span id="s1140">There was one thing that occurred at that time that is -- I think I should mention.</span> <span id="s1141">I was introduced to something called typhoon.</span> <span id="s1142">They have typhoons and this is like a hurricane, I-I think on a grander scale, cause you know, Japan is like an island.</span> <span id="s1143">And anyway, we had this typhoon and I mean, you have to prepare yourself and all -- everything was closed and all.</span> <span id="s1144">And I was still in that one house on the depot, there were no other houses.</span> <span id="s1145">But the military, they would call me, and some of the wives would come, you know, and lend a helping hand.</span> <span id="s1146">And there again you go, I did not feel very abandoned.</span> <span id="s1147">But the typhoon was very, very difficult because there was no -- there is no -- there are no basements in that area, and this is the area of Yokohama.</span> <span id="s1148">And the house was a not a very, I guess, sturdy house.</span> <span id="s1149">But we lived through it, was about three or four days, but in the middle of the typhoon, I did get a -- I had a telephone.</span> <span id="s1150">I did get a telephone call from one of my compatriots who lived already in the American section, which we later did get housing and we joined.</span> <span id="s1151">And she called me to let me know that my husband was killed in the typhoon.</span> <span id="s1152">He was on a boat because his lab was on a little island off Yakoska.</span> <span id="s1153">Yakoska is a port, and we always used to make fun that everything was classified, but you go to Yakoska because you know, it is a -- a -- what do you call it, port city, and on all the bars and all it says, welcome the Enterprise.</span> <span id="s1154">In other words, Enterprise the ship is arriving.</span> <span id="s1155">It was supposed to be classified, but they na -- knew it all.</span> <span id="s1156">Well anyway, this friend called me to say that my husband was killed.</span> <span id="s1157">He drown -- his little boat that he was going from the lab, he was trying to come back home, and then the boat capsized and he drowned.</span> <span id="s1158">And for about two days I didn’t know any different cause the typhoon was still raging.</span> <span id="s1159">And of course, thank God, it was a mistake.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">Q: Oh my God.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">A: It happened twice actually, in -- in Japan, you know.</span> <span id="s1162">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">A: -- so anyway, but finally we did get housing on the -- they called it Nagishi Heights, and we moved there.</span> <span id="s1165">It was a very nice house.</span> <span id="s1166">Very interestingly, the house bordered a -- it was an enclosed area where mo -- not mostly, where all the American military and their wives lived.</span> <span id="s1167">And the house was a substantial house, but it bordered a Japanese cemetery.</span> <span id="s1168">And every day you’d go to the living room window, look out and you would see from the fences and all, eyes staring at you, and that was -- these were the Japanese people, they were just curious.</span> <span id="s1169">At -- in the cem -- at the cemetery, looking into our windows.</span> <span id="s1170">But it was a very interesting experience being in Japan.</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">Q: Let me ask you a question about that.</span> <span id="s1172">Was there any sense of irony for you to be in Japan as an American, as the conqueror of Japan --</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Q: -- when you had been a Holocaust survivor, and on the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">A: You’re very perceptive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">Q: -- receiving end --</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">Q: -- of that experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">A: Yeah, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">Q: What was that -- it must have been --</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">A: Was a good feeling.</span> <span id="s1182">It was of -- I cannot describe it, but I was -- and I am, I guess, I -- I was a very good military wife, and I tried to do everything by the book.</span> <span id="s1183">And just to give you an example even then, I mean, I felt empowered.</span> <span id="s1184">I did.</span> <span id="s1185">But of course there was always the worry about your husband, you know, and I mean he had to fly out to different countries and all and I -- and that’s the army, the military life is that there are many separations.</span> <span id="s1186">But the one thing I remember -- and I mean, we were told you have to give so many cocktail parties and all that.</span> <span id="s1187">And I remember my first party when we moved to Nagishi Heights.</span> <span id="s1188">It was to be a part -- I can’t remember what our holiday was or whatever.</span> <span id="s1189">And I said, oh yes, I’ll give a party.</span> <span id="s1190">At that time I’ve learned how to cook and how to serve the right things, but I liked to have the wives also.</span> <span id="s1191">Because the Japanese businessmen, and this -- these were mostly the people who had all these oil factories -- I mean, not the factories, what do you call it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">Q: Refineries.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">A: The refineries.</span> <span id="s1194">And I mean he -- th-these are the -- the highfalutin people in Japan.</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">Q: Very wealthy families.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">A: Yes, very wealthy families.</span> <span id="s1197">And I said, I will not invite them unless I get permission to invite the wives.</span> <span id="s1198">And this was unheard of in Japan because their system is where the wife goes three steps behind, even today.</span> <span id="s1199">And I mean, I felt I had my rights, and I felt empowered to do that.</span> <span id="s1200">And I said, I’m an American and in our society, the man come with their spouses.</span> <span id="s1201">And they allowed me to do that.</span> <span id="s1202">And I -- I -- I would say that I probably established the first of -- I guess, way of including the wives.</span> <span id="s1203">Because when we went to the Japanese affairs, there were never any wives.</span> <span id="s1204">There were Geisha girls, who were assigned to entertain the men and the women, because we were invited.</span> <span id="s1205">And I mean, we would have a Geisha, and I mean she would -- I mean, it was clean fun, but very sexist.</span> <span id="s1206">I mean, in the sense that the wife is subservient and the Geisha is supposed to amuse me, you know, with some stupid things.</span> <span id="s1207">It was very -- I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s1208">No, but th-the set-up was that the wife did not count.</span> <span id="s1209">And the Americans -- they had to suffer and they had to invite the Americans -- they didn’t have to, but they did.</span> <span id="s1210">And they were sort of tolerated.</span> <span id="s1211">That’s the way I felt with the Japanese.</span> <span id="s1212">But when I invited the wives, the spouses of these business people, I’ll tell you, every one of them came.</span> <span id="s1213">They were dressed in their most beautiful kimonos, th-their outfits, their national, you know, outfits are magnificent.</span> <span id="s1214">Each one brought an exquisite gift.</span> <span id="s1215">And they were so thankful.</span> <span id="s1216">And from then on, any time I entertained, wives were always included, and they knew it.</span> <span id="s1217">And other women took the lead from my lead, and they started doing the same thing.</span> <span id="s1218">And I felt very empowered, very good about what I accomplished there.</span> <span id="s1219">And the wives were elegant and lovely and dainty and very, very grateful.</span> <span id="s1220">And th -- we’ve kept in touch with quite a few of them, because to them it was just an -- a wonderful treat.</span> <span id="s1221">We were invited once to the -- to Emperor Hirohito’s birthday party, and that was a wonderful, wonderful experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">Q: In Tokyo?</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">A: Yeah, to -- Yokohama and T-Tokyo is not very far from Yokohama.</span> <span id="s1224">And I have made a policy -- or I mean, I don’t know if it’s because of my experiences but when we go overseas or when we go anyplace, a lot of Americans live in an American ghetto.</span> <span id="s1225">They live in their assigned housing.</span> <span id="s1226">They go and exchange parties or play bridge, you know, which, you know, we don’t, for many reasons.</span> <span id="s1227">But they stick to their own.</span> <span id="s1228">And I feel that’s wrong.</span> <span id="s1229">When you go someplace and -- where you’re assigned, you are a representative, you’re an ambassador of your country to the country that you are visiting, because that’s all you’re doing, you’re vi -- you are a visitor, and you should show your best side.</span> <span id="s1230">And we have tried to absorb the culture, to go to Kabuki, to go to the museums, to mingle with the -- with the Japanese.</span> <span id="s1231">And I felt that it was, in a way your mind doesn’t become stagnant and you acquire an awful lot of knowledge, and you enjoyed a -- a -- you know, just -- as well.</span> <span id="s1232">So there are many, many, you know, positive things that come from living oversi -- overseas, but you have to be willing to give of yourself and to represent your country in the best way possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">Q: Do you think that your desire to mingle with local people was also s -- driven in part by your experience as a survivor, where you were ghettoized, and you had suffered the consequences of that kind of thinking before, and so you were feeling some insistence on people of different cultures --</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">A: Of di -- maybe so, I never --</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">Q: -- mingling -- it wasn’t conscious then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">A: Yeah, I don’t think it was conscious, but you have a very good point, and boy are you perceptive.</span> <span id="s1237">Yeah, I -- I am sure that had some -- I’ve always been surround -- I wanted to surround myself with people.</span> <span id="s1238">Now, as my -- you know, as I’m getting older, in the golden years, I enjoy solitude.</span> <span id="s1239">I am never bored with myself, I don’t have enough time to myself.</span> <span id="s1240">But in those days, yes, it was wonderful to be surrounded by people and especially of a different culture and to learn.</span> <span id="s1241">And I mean, I knew the background, I knew the history and it’s always, you know, maybe I didn’t know as much, but I knew, I mean they -- they were the perpetrators and they were very cruel and th-then I learned about the Shanghai Jews, who survived in Shanghai.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">A: But the psyche of a Japanese is -- End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">A: -- about Japan.</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">Q: [indecipherable] about Japan.</span> <span id="s1246">This is tape three, side one, of Charlene Schiff.</span> <span id="s1247">You were talking about the psyche of the Japanese.</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">A: They -- they’re very inscrutable, is there such a word?</span> <span id="s1249">You never know what they really think.</span> <span id="s1250">They always have a smile on their face, and they would say yes, they -- they hate to say no.</span> <span id="s1251">It’s like yes, we have no bananas.</span> <span id="s1252">And it’s true.</span> <span id="s1253">But we have made some wonderful friendships there.</span> <span id="s1254">My husband had a very loyal crew.</span> <span id="s1255">He needed to depend a lot on the Japanese because -- and this was all classified stuff, with the testing of all the jet fuels and all.</span> <span id="s1256">And he had a very responsible job there.</span> <span id="s1257">And we’ve made many friends among the military.</span> <span id="s1258">And as a matter of fact, that’s where I first took up Chinese cooking.</span> <span id="s1259">I -- Chinese, and that’s Japan.</span> <span id="s1260">What was happening, there were two Benedictine sisters in Tokyo, and they were stranded during the war.</span> <span id="s1261">They came from China, they were working in China, Americans.</span> <span id="s1262">And they were stranded in Japan with no income, no way of making a livelihood.</span> <span id="s1263">And so they opened a school for the military, for the -- all the military in -- in the area, and started teaching Chinese cooking.</span> <span id="s1264">And these schools became so famous that all the embassy people, you know, wanted to -- it wa -- it took about a year or so to go through the course.</span> <span id="s1265">I had to wait a full year to be able to f -- you know, to enroll.</span> <span id="s1266">And they came out with a little booklet of -- well, a little cookbook where they adapted the Chinese recipes to American consumption.</span> <span id="s1267">And they were so much fun and it was a fantastic experience.</span> <span id="s1268">For a whole year I took this cooking course.</span> <span id="s1269">And they -- they -- we corresponded until they passed on.</span> <span id="s1270">But it was very well known in the embassy and all, all the wives were just waiting, you know, to attend this.</span> <span id="s1271">Then I also took cor -- courses in flower arranging.</span> <span id="s1272">I tried to, you know, get more culture, what have you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">Q: Ikebana.</span> <span id="s1274">A: Ikebana, that’s right.</span> <span id="s1275">And I was learning, and that I took for three years.</span> <span id="s1276">And I passed, now I have a Japanese professional name, and I became an instructor, and don’t ask me to arrange two flowers now, cause I don’t know how.</span> <span id="s1277">But I mean, the lines and all, it’s very, very precise, and very exact.</span> <span id="s1278">And I attended these classes for three years and I came back home and that all of a sudden -- I did know that you don’t need a dozen roses to make an arrangements, can make it -- an arrangement, you can make it with one rose.</span> <span id="s1279">And I enjoyed that very much.</span> <span id="s1280">We attended kabuki and we traveled quite a bit.</span> <span id="s1281">It was a good time, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">Q: What were the years that you were in Japan?</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">A: It was ’56 when my son was born, til ’60.</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">Q: And then -- let me ask you one thing about Japan.</span> <span id="s1287">Was your being a survivor an issue in any way with anyone?</span> <span id="s1288">With you, or with any of the other Americans that you knew --</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">Q: -- or with the Japanese?</span> <span id="s1291">And was that okay --</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">A: The Japanese couldn’t -- wouldn’t know, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">Q: And was that okay with you, was it --</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">Q: -- [indecipherable] knew --</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">A: No, actually, when I married my husband it seems like I went into a different world, and I had no connection with survivors, not at all.</span> <span id="s1297">And I mean, I didn’t know anyone.</span> <span id="s1298">I -- I did keep in touch with my friend Sonya in Duluth and -- and of course with my family in Columbus and New York.</span> <span id="s1299">But no, I had no connection with any other survivors.</span> <span id="s1300">And you know what?</span> <span id="s1301">That was good --</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">Q: You think?</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">A: -- at that time, yes.</span> <span id="s1304">I needed that.</span> <span id="s1305">I -- when I married my husband I felt that -- and I mean when I came here, I wanted to become Americanized overnight.</span> <span id="s1306">And that desire didn’t leave me and when I met my husband and when we married, I wanted him to be proud of me and not to be referred as the greener.</span> <span id="s1307">And you know what a greener means?</span> <span id="s1308">A greener means the -- the -- when you’re green means your -- you’re a -- a stranger.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">A: And they always say the greener couzina.</span> <span id="s1311">The couzina’s like a cousin.</span> <span id="s1312">And in Yiddish it’s the greener couzina, it means the -- the stranger who doesn’t know how to pick up a fork, you know.</span> <span id="s1313">I -- I wanted to become Americanized and I didn’t feel that until I became Mrs. Erwin H. Schiff.</span> <span id="s1314">And I-I don’t know, but in Japan I don’t think -- if anyone was aware of it, they didn’t question it, they didn’t treat me any differently.</span> <span id="s1315">I was one -- we did make friendship a lo -- a lot of friends.</span> <span id="s1316">We met friends in Japan and we have one couple, the husband just died in -- suddenly.</span> <span id="s1317">But we’ve been friends since Japan and they are Jewish.</span> <span id="s1318">He was a lawyer and he had open heart surgery.</span> <span id="s1319">The surgery was a success, then he got an infection, you know, what do you call it, that horrible thing, and he died.</span> <span id="s1320">And -- and his wife and my husband and I are still dear friends and we keep in touch almost on a daily basis.</span> <span id="s1321">She lives part-time here and part-time in Newport, Rhode Island.</span> <span id="s1322">But -- and we met in Japan.</span> <span id="s1323">So we were active there in the chapel, in the Jewish chapel and we had several Bar Mitzvahs and all that took place there.</span> <span id="s1324">So -- but nobody ever made an issue of where I come from.</span> <span id="s1325">I was -- what was he at that time, I think a major -- Major Schiff’s wife, Charlene.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">Q: Well, military is --</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">A: Militar --</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">Q: -- an equalizer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">A: That’s right, the great equalizer.</span> <span id="s1330">And I mean, sometimes you wonder how things happen.</span> <span id="s1331">I mean, a Jewish boy, they kept saying, a Jewish boy going th-the military, making a career out of it?</span> <span id="s1332">It’s unheard of.</span> <span id="s1333">And -- and coming ba -- well no, we haven’t reached Vietnam yet, have we?</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">Q: No [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">A: Not yet.</span> <span id="s1336">But yes, it was the great equalizer for me, and it was the best thing that could have happened to me.</span> <span id="s1337">My daughter-in-law, as I said, said she could have never been a military wife.</span> <span id="s1338">But I mean, the hardship that come -- th-that -- the hardships that come with -- with being in the military are many.</span> <span id="s1339">And I mean, the moving around -- our son was in 17 different schools before he attended high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">A: Yeah, he -- didn’t hurt him one bit.</span> <span id="s1342">He entered he -- he -- his -- he went to Princeton.</span> <span id="s1343">Then, you know, he went to medical school.</span> <span id="s1344">Did medical school in three years, then trained in har -- at Harvard for his specialty, urology for seven years.</span> <span id="s1345">And now, you know, is in private practice, and teaches part time in Brown.</span> <span id="s1346">And when he got out from Harvard he was in -- at Yale as a -- on the staff and faculty of the medical school.</span> <span id="s1347">So it didn’t hurt him, not at all.</span> <span id="s1348">But you mix the bitter with the sweet, and it’s an experience.</span> <span id="s1349">And it takes a special person to be a good army -- a m -- a military wife.</span> <span id="s1350">And in the early years it seemed that the wife doesn’t have much to say.</span> <span id="s1351">You go where the husband has to si -- to -- to go.</span> <span id="s1352">And that is still true.</span> <span id="s1353">But yet, you can leave your mark.</span> <span id="s1354">You can do things that you want to do.</span> <span id="s1355">When I established this precedent, I mean, it wasn’t happening until then that the wives, the Japanese wives were invited to cocktail parties and all.</span> <span id="s1356">It was a fantastic achievement and I’m still proud of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">A: So, you know, there are pros and cons and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">A: -- for me it was good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1362">So you came back to this -- did you come stateside in 1960 --</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">A: Yeah, we came back to the States --</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">Q: -- and this is -- you -- you had --</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">A: -- yeah.</span> <span id="s1366">1961.</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">Q: -- all this is -- you mentioned the era of Vietnam.</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">A: Yeah, well Ed, at that time I think he was assigned to Fort Lee again.</span> <span id="s1369">No, I think he was assigned not -- yes -- no, to the Pentagon.</span> <span id="s1370">But at the Pentagon he was only, I think, a year.</span> <span id="s1371">And then we went to Fort Lee again.</span> <span id="s1372">And then -- I can’t remember exactly what year -- we were active at Fort Lee, that’s the quartermaster headquarters.</span> <span id="s1373">And my husband was still with petroleum and all, but he was at Fort Lee, you know, assigned permanently to Fort Lee, Virginia, but he spent an awful lot of time at the pentagon.</span> <span id="s1374">So again I -- he’d go for two weeks and come back maybe for three days.</span> <span id="s1375">And so it was, you know, that I was there for my s -- for our son.</span> <span id="s1376">We were very much involved there, at Fort Lee with the Jewish chapel.</span> <span id="s1377">And that’s where we met a very wonderful man, Rabbi Elster.</span> <span id="s1378">Rabbi Elster was serving the military, his -- what was it, two or three years, and then was going to get out and be a rabbi in the civilian world.</span> <span id="s1379">We became fast friends, Rabbi Elster and Shulamit Elster, and now they have three married kids.</span> <span id="s1380">But our friendship started at Fort Lee.</span> <span id="s1381">My husband was at Fort Lee and then he got orders for Vietnam.</span> <span id="s1382">I think it was 1964, and between Fort Lee and -- and the Pentagon, you know, and some other places that he would go like for six weeks and come back.</span> <span id="s1383">When he was assigned to Vietnam the first time, in 1965, was the beginning of our involvement.</span> <span id="s1384">Well, the military involvement.</span> <span id="s1385">I think they had advisors and all earlier.</span> <span id="s1386">But in 1965 my husband was called on to go to Vietnam.</span> <span id="s1387">He was very much against our involvement in Vietnam, and when he got -- but he was in the military and they ordered him, so he went.</span> <span id="s1388">He expressed his, I guess his views to the higher ups, and he wasn’t the only one, because he said, this is a kind of war that we cannot win, because we are trained to conduct a -- a re -- what do you call it, a -- a regular war, and these people are not terrorists, but they are guerillas and they were fighting the war in Vietnam from the underground.</span> <span id="s1389">They had th -- we went to Vietnam just five years ago, and I saw these tunnels and all.</span> <span id="s1390">They were fighting everything from the underground.</span> <span id="s1391">And my husband and several -- and other people, the younger, the younger officers said this is ki -- the kind of war it cannot be won.</span> <span id="s1392">But of course, they didn’t listen to them.</span> <span id="s1393">But, when my husband got orders to Vietnam, I decided in my infinite wisdom -- I’m being sarcastic -- to go to Columbus, to stay in Columbus.</span> <span id="s1394">Why?</span> <span id="s1395">Because I had family there, my aunt was still there.</span> <span id="s1396">I -- so I rented an apartment near where she lived, and enrolled my son, at that time I think he was in third grade, and he had his cousins there, you know.</span> <span id="s1397">I say cousins, but they were my cousins, but he counted them as his cousins.</span> <span id="s1398">And we lived the year that my husband was in Vietnam in Columbus, Ohio.</span> <span id="s1399">Was a miserable year.</span> <span id="s1400">Why?</span> <span id="s1401">Everybody that I knew and everybody who knew me was always asking, what is your husband doing in Vietnam?</span> <span id="s1402">Why didn't he go to Canada?</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">A: Because some of these people went to Canada.</span> <span id="s1405">And I even got into a fight at an airpor -- at the airport.</span> <span id="s1406">And there were some young people picketing, you know, and protesting the war.</span> <span id="s1407">And at that time I felt my husband is there, I didn’t know the situation, but his country, right or wrong.</span> <span id="s1408">And he’s serving his country, he’s there.</span> <span id="s1409">And I didn’t like the way they propr -- they were protesting and screaming, you know, and cursing and all, and I slapped one guy in the face.</span> <span id="s1410">I almost ended up in jail.</span> <span id="s1411">But that was my experience you know, in -- in Columbus.</span> <span id="s1412">It was not a good experience.</span> <span id="s1413">And after that, when my husband came back -- and that -- that first year was also very -- I did get a call that my husband was killed and that was -- he was assigned again with petroleum.</span> <span id="s1414">All the oils and the jet fuels and all for -- for the entire area.</span> <span id="s1415">And at that time he -- the headquarters were in Saigon and they were -- there was a big inter -- there was a -- a -- a big explosion, it was all over the news, and in a great hotel -- I forgot the name of the hotel, and a lot of Americans lost their lives.</span> <span id="s1416">As it was, my husband had a meeting at that ho -- in that hotel with some generals and all, I don’t know what it was, and he wrote me daily, and -- that first year that he was in Vietnam.</span> <span id="s1417">And he told me he was going to be, you know, in Saint Regis, I think, hotel on Tuesday of whatever.</span> <span id="s1418">That -- the letters would go about a week or so, and that Tuesday when he was supposed to be there, they had a big ex -- they bombed the -- the guerillas, the hotel and -- and you know, there were a lot of casualties.</span> <span id="s1419">And I called the Red Cross to find out what was happening, and they -- that’s why I’ll never give another penny to the Red Cross -- and they called me back that my husband was killed.</span> <span id="s1420">And as it happened, my husband was in the hotel and left five minutes before the explosion.</span> <span id="s1421">So, you know, lucky for me and for him.</span> <span id="s1422">When he came back from Vietnam he was smoking something like two packs of cigarettes a day.</span> <span id="s1423">He was, I think, bone -- skin and bone and his hands were shaking.</span> <span id="s1424">He -- he was a mess.</span> <span id="s1425">Very -- I mean, physically very frail.</span> <span id="s1426">He was a young man at that time.</span> <span id="s1427">And it wa -- it was very sad to watch.</span> <span id="s1428">And then when he came, with the reception he got in Columbus was just absolutely dem-demoralizing.</span> <span id="s1429">His next orders were to work with the chiefs of staff and the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon.</span> <span id="s1430">And so he ended up working in the Pentagon, and we bought our first and only modest house in Springfield, Virginia, which is a suburb here.</span> <span id="s1431">And that was the first time that our Stephen, our son, went to the same school two years in a row.</span> <span id="s1432">And he worked in -- in the Pentagon.</span> <span id="s1433">I never saw him because most of the time the hours were miserable.</span> <span id="s1434">But he kept on saying that, you know, he and other young -- they called them the young Turks -- kept saying that Vietnam is something we should never have gotten involved in.</span> <span id="s1435">Well, lo and behold, in 1969 he got orders to go back to Vietnam to the same petroleum job.</span> <span id="s1436">But this time he was going to Play Ku, which is the mountainous area.</span> <span id="s1437">And he -- this time he had his own chopper and he had to supply the fuels not just for Vietnam, but for the entire area of all the countries around, a very big job.</span> <span id="s1438">And he had to -- actually had to build the pipes and all that go.</span> <span id="s1439">And there again, he spent a -- a year, that was -- had many close calls.</span> <span id="s1440">Once the -- the chopper that he was in -- he had a pilot, he didn’t pilot it himself, but it was -- there was an explosion.</span> <span id="s1441">All the buttons on his shirt were ripped off and he came out with a s -- without a scratch.</span> <span id="s1442">And there were several -- and then, I mean, he worked so hard.</span> <span id="s1443">And it wa -- and then they had to go into Cambodia, which was a classified thing, I wasn't supposed to know about it, and all that.</span> <span id="s1444">Finally, thank God, he came back.</span> <span id="s1445">He came back and he was assigned -- and again, he had several very big arguments with his superiors.</span> <span id="s1446">He, and other young men, officers.</span> <span id="s1447">And they were, of course they weren’t listened to.</span> <span id="s1448">And he ended up again at the Pentagon.</span> <span id="s1449">And at that time they promised him a star.</span> <span id="s1450">He was going to become a general if he would give up his ideas about Vietnam.</span> <span id="s1451">He couldn’t do that.</span> <span id="s1452">And that’s when he retired.</span> <span id="s1453">In a way as a protest, you know.</span> <span id="s1454">And then he went to work, you know, different places and all.</span> <span id="s1455">And at that time, after he retired, we decided to make our home here, to stay where we -- we still had the little house, and our son was a big man on campus in high school here.</span> <span id="s1456">And he went to work for a -- an association, my husband.</span> <span id="s1457">And at that time, in 1983, I think we had the first Holocaust survivors meeting here in Washington, and I attended it.</span> <span id="s1458">Meanwhile, and then at -- this is again not correct chronologically, before my husband went for the second time to Vietnam, we belonged to Fort Belvoir, which is a military group here, and there was a Jewish chapel and a chaplain.</span> <span id="s1459">We did get a call from our old friend, Rabbi Elster, who said that he was coming to take over the pulpit at Agudas Achim in Alexandria.</span> <span id="s1460">And of course, when we heard that, we joined Agudas Achim and we are still members today.</span> <span id="s1461">But Rabbi Elster’s not there any more.</span> <span id="s1462">But at that time we refreshed -- I mean, we -- we -- we were such good friends to begin with, it was wonderful to be again with them, with the Elsters, and he became our rabbi.</span> <span id="s1463">And we belonged to Agudas Achim and we still belong to Fort Belvoir.</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">Q: Before we get to the 1983 meeting, let me ask you a question and a half.</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">Q: Your son was in high school --</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">Q: -- around in the 70’s when your husband left the military and you were living --</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">Q: -- in this area, and stabilized.</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">A: Yes</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">Q: [indecipherable] stable, more stable.</span> <span id="s1473">You were looking around [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">A: Yeah, yes.</span> <span id="s1475">The first time in the same place for more than a year or two.</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">Q: And you had this long friendship with this rabbi --</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">Q: -- who later becomes, I know, instrumental in your own decision to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">A: Yes, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">Q: -- become active.</span> <span id="s1481">But I want to know if -- h-how -- I don’t even know how to ask it.</span> <span id="s1482">Your hap -- your being a survivor, was this something that you had ex -- talked to your son about up until that time?</span> <span id="s1483">Did he know, and how did you tell him, and was that -- or was it an issue?</span> <span id="s1484">Di -- was it difficult to tell him, was it a -- a sensitive --</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">A: No.</span> <span id="s1486">It was an issue for the simple reason that I was very ill from the time he was very little.</span> <span id="s1487">And I had many physical problems and I -- but a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">Q: Relating to your experience --</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">A: Probably everything related, you know, I have ulcers, I had other very serious progre -- problems.</span> <span id="s1490">And that was one reason that he wanted to become a doctor from the time he was four years of age, cause mommy was always sick.</span> <span id="s1491">And mommy was sick -- and I mean, even in spite of her being sick, she always did everything and nobody really knew that much, but I had an awful lot of sickness.</span> <span id="s1492">But -- so that was not much of a problem.</span> <span id="s1493">He knew.</span> <span id="s1494">And I don’t know how much he comprehended when he was very young, but he always, when -- when my husband went to Vietnam the first time, he says, I’m going to be the man of the family, I’ll take care of Mommy.</span> <span id="s1495">And he did.</span> <span id="s1496">He -- he was a wonderful boy from the very beginning.</span> <span id="s1497">We never had any problems with him.</span> <span id="s1498">He never smoked, he never drank, he never -- he was never on drugs, he was always just a straight arrow.</span> <span id="s1499">And the thing -- it must have been very difficult on him.</span> <span id="s1500">I -- his father was a wonderful father and is a wonderful, very even tempered and all.</span> <span id="s1501">I was the explosive one.</span> <span id="s1502">I was the one who demanded -- demanded more than perfection, because -- in retrospect, I didn’t realize then, but in retrospect I think I tried to live my youth through my son.</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">Q: Which had been robbed from you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1505">But he had to be more perfect than perfect.</span> <span id="s1506">He had to have straight A’s, and he had to take all advanced courses, and he had to be the big man on campus.</span> <span id="s1507">And he didn’t live up to one -- he wa -- he never had straight A’s even in high school, but yet, he was the one -- the only one who was accepted at sprin -- to Princeton.</span> <span id="s1508">He -- he was a wonderful student, but he was so busy with other things too, that he just didn’t get straight A’s.</span> <span id="s1509">I think he had two B’s or so.</span> <span id="s1510">But the valedictorian from the high school didn’t get into Princeton, but Stephen did.</span> <span id="s1511">Has a wonderful personality and he -- he did everything beautifully.</span> <span id="s1512">He -- he would make a wonderful lawyer, he would make a wonderful politician.</span> <span id="s1513">He is just good with people, because he was always with people and he always had to face new friends because we moved so much.</span> <span id="s1514">And it did -- it did come and I mean it di -- it was good for him.</span> <span id="s1515">And he is very cosmopolitan, he’s very sophisticated, and he feels good and felt good about himself.</span> <span id="s1516">I instilled on him that there is nothing he cannot do.</span> <span id="s1517">I told him, you are better than anybody else, and I was a little bit too demanding.</span> <span id="s1518">So he knew all the things; as time progressed I would tell him stories, and he was very -- hi-his -- the way he received it was very adult like, very adult like.</span> <span id="s1519">And he was, I guess, used to being sort of the head of the family when my husband wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s1520">So he said, don’t worry, Mommy, I’ll take care of you, I’ll take care of you.</span> <span id="s1521">And he did.</span> <span id="s1522">He was very good and he was -- we had an awful -- even though when I -- the second time when my husband was in Vietnam, I already lived here in Springfield in our little house.</span> <span id="s1523">And there were a lot of nasty things that were going on.</span> <span id="s1524">I would get phone calls in the middle of the night, your husband is in Vietnam, we know you’re alone, you know.</span> <span id="s1525">And I would call the police and they would say I have to -- they cannot do anything unless they are there.</span> <span id="s1526">We installed a -- what do you call it, a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1527">Q: Security --</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">A: -- a security thing and they tried to break in twice.</span> <span id="s1529">And Stephen was always just with a -- you know, a -- a bat in his hand, you know, he was going to take care of.</span> <span id="s1530">So he was very mature for his age and nothing surprised him any more.</span> <span id="s1531">And he’s also -- he’s a little bit like his father, he’s a wonderful son and I think he’s a wonderful husband and a wonderful father.</span> <span id="s1532">Of course, I’m being prejudiced at this point, but he really is a very good person.</span> <span id="s1533">He -- he is a -- a urologic surgeon and he lives now in provident -- outside Providence, Rhode, Island, and it’s a very poor state and there are many people that he treats pro bono, because they don’t have insurance, what is he gonna do?</span> <span id="s1534">And -- but anyway, he --</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">Q: We finished this side.</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">Q: This is tape three, side two of Charlene Schiff.</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">A: Actually, what I didn’t say before, I said I didn’t have any contact with survivors.</span> <span id="s1540">I did keep in touch with one survivor who -- whom I met in a DP ca -- in the Benzheim DP camp, and I still keep in touch with her, off and on.</span> <span id="s1541">She survived with her mother, and we kept in touch off and on.</span> <span id="s1542">Now, I did see her last year, and I don’t know if I should even say it, but all of a sudden I look at her -- her mother died since and she has remar -- she married and she just lost her husband, she has three children.</span> <span id="s1543">She was a wonderful girl and we were very like, you know, real friends.</span> <span id="s1544">And now when I came -- they live in flor -- she lives in Florida, I found I have nothing in common with her except the fact that we were in the DP camp together, in the same DP camp.</span> <span id="s1545">And I don’t know if this is a strange occurrence but all of a sudden -- interestingly enough, when we were in DP camps we didn’t discuss our pasts.</span> <span id="s1546">Most of us did not discuss our past.</span> <span id="s1547">I didn’t even know -- I knew that she survived, I think, in Russia, i-in the Soviet Union, she was not in, you know, in -- in Hitler’s -- under Hitler’s regime.</span> <span id="s1548">But when I met her last year, we had nothing in common.</span> <span id="s1549">How can that happen?</span> <span id="s1550">And, I mean, it was nice to see her and all, but nothing in common.</span> <span id="s1551">But -- do we go back to what, to ’83?</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">Q: Well, we were talking ab -- you were saying about -- I had asked you about your son and how much he knew and how -- what -- you know, what -- how you transferred all of that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">A: To him.</span> <span id="s1554">Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s1555">Q: -- history, and -- and was it important -- obviously it was important to you to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">Q: -- that he knew.</span> <span id="s1558">I mean, that’s not always the case, I th --</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">A: Yes, and he was interested.</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">A: He was very interested, and he -- he a-again, he is a very sweet boy and -- and was a sweet boy and he gave me his love and his caring and was very demonst -- it -- it was demonstrated in a very obvious way, and that was very nice.</span> <span id="s1562">And he -- he d -- I think -- I don’t know if he understood everything, but it was given to him -- I -- I gave it to him gradually.</span> <span id="s1563">And it wasn’t shocking to him, and he -- because he -- he says, well, that’s why you’ve been so ill.</span> <span id="s1564">And it made a lot of sense to him.</span> <span id="s1565">And then in 90 -- 1992, I think, I can’t remember and I shouldn’t jump ahead, but just to make a point, we had one of our annual gatherings, the child survivors.</span> <span id="s1566">We consider ourselves a separate group, not all survivors, but the child survivors.</span> <span id="s1567">And we, for the first time we organized a -- we had a second generation panel, and my son came.</span> <span id="s1568">At that time he was already married.</span> <span id="s1569">And he was the leader of the second generation.</span> <span id="s1570">And everyone in that second generation, and th-that’s another story, tried to blame the parents for their short -- for their shortcomings or for their not realizing their dreams or so, because their parents were survivors.</span> <span id="s1571">And Stephen said that he and I got along and he accepted me the way I was because I am his mother.</span> <span id="s1572">But he didn’t blame the Holocaust for my what do you call it?</span> <span id="s1573">Peculiarities or for my idiosyncrasies.</span> <span id="s1574">I was his mother, and as his mother he loved me the way I am.</span> <span id="s1575">And that was his main argument, that it didn’t have anything to do with being a survivor.</span> <span id="s1576">He accepted me the way I was.</span> <span id="s1577">He didn’t blame it on the Holocaust or on my being a survivor, why I had temper tantrums, why I yelled at him, why I wanted him to be better than perfect.</span> <span id="s1578">He felt that’s the way I am and that’s what I wanted from him.</span> <span id="s1579">And I don’t know, but maybe it was good.</span> <span id="s1580">Was a very healthy, it seems to me, attitude.</span> <span id="s1581">And now he’s very interested.</span> <span id="s1582">He doesn’t have much time to be involved with second generation, but like two months from now or I think this early spring, I’m being invited by my grandsons class to speak about my experiences, and he’ll introduce me.</span> <span id="s1583">And that is a day that I can’t wait for.</span> <span id="s1584">And my grandson does not know much.</span> <span id="s1585">He does, but he is now 11 and when Stephen was 11 he knew a lot more.</span> <span id="s1586">My grandson knows when I come, or when I went t -- he was younger, and even now he says, Nana, would you sing me these songs that are not in English?</span> <span id="s1587">Lullabies or so.</span> <span id="s1588">And you know -- and he knows a little bit, the older one, but not as much as my son did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">Q: Hm.</span> <span id="s1590">That’s interesting.</span> <span id="s1591">It’s all --</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">Q: -- it’s always interesting to me how people choose to tell the next generation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">Q: When they do it, how they do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">Q: It’s always different with every person.</span> <span id="s1598">But it sounds like for you, you never questioned that you should.</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">Q: All along.</span> <span id="s1601">It was never choice, you just --</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">A: Never questioned, only had one [indecipherable] all basket -- all eggs in one basket, and he needed to know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">A: He -- and when he was very young, he says how come everybody has two sets of grandparents and I only have one?</span> <span id="s1605">You know.</span> <span id="s1606">And that’s the way it started, you know, but I tried to make it not so that he would have nightmares, you know, and make it more palatable, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1607">And it was a way of life, that’s the way -- just like his father was a military man, and there were no questions, that’s they way it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">Q: And -- and one more question before we get to 1983 and take a little break.</span> <span id="s1609">It seems like from what you’re saying that from the time you came to the U.S. in the late 40’s, until this period after your husband came back from Vietnam, you had so many travels, so many different experiences, so much -- you know, in raising a son.</span> <span id="s1610">But it sounds like between the lines that yo -- in a way, that you have healed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">Q: Part of you has -- is found a place, found a life --</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">A: -- come -- yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">Q: -- and made a happy and safe place for yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">A: Well, and I’ll tell you, I have never been nosh -- they o -- this -- in schools I get many questions -- I mean, many schools are -- are -- are you being seen by a psychiatrist, did you have what do you call it?</span> <span id="s1616">When you go through years of --</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">Q: Therapy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">A: -- therapy.</span> <span id="s1619">I’ve never seen a psychiatrist, I’ve never gone through therapy.</span> <span id="s1620">I think my healing came from my family, from my husband and my son.</span> <span id="s1621">And my aunt.</span> <span id="s1622">No matter what, may she rest in peace, she was an angel.</span> <span id="s1623">I really miss her so much.</span> <span id="s1624">She -- she and I understood each other finally, and I -- I don’t know if I appreciated her as much when I first came to this country as she deserved to be appreciated, but I loved her with all my heart, and she deserved that love.</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">Q: Isn’t it amazing how one person can make a difference in a life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">A: Oh yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1627">Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1629">A: When I came here, I mean, my mother was a teacher by profession, but she wasn’t teaching.</span> <span id="s1630">I don’t remember her ever teaching.</span> <span id="s1631">She did an awful lot of philanthropic things in our town and as a matter of fact, she organized camps for poor children, Jewish children and Gentile chil -- children.</span> <span id="s1632">And I mean not she alone, but she was always the head of it.</span> <span id="s1633">And so she wasn’t, you know, sitting at home and all, but we always had a lot of quality time, and I didn’t learn how to cook and all, who would ever think?</span> <span id="s1634">But my mother set a beautiful table, and we always had a lot of people, was an open house, people were coming and going.</span> <span id="s1635">And she -- and I always -- I remember like for Passover or so, I mean, there was crystal and there was silver, and the linen tablecloths and china.</span> <span id="s1636">And I’ve always missed that, and I remember even in the forest, I would sort of daydream, gosh, when I grow up, Momma will come and show me how to set a pretty table.</span> <span id="s1637">And then when I came to the States, to the United States, my aunt, I don’t know what it was, but she set a beautiful table, even though that her heart was crying within her, but the holidays, Thanksgiving and Passover, the little time that we spent that I was there, she set a beautiful table with linens and crystal and I told her, that reminds me of home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1638">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">A: And to me even now -- we live in an apartment and usually it’s all right, now it’s a mess, but I don’t entertain any more, nobody does.</span> <span id="s1640">But nothing gives me greater pleasure than to set a pretty table.</span> <span id="s1641">And it somehow brings me closer to my past.</span> <span id="s1642">And my daughter-in-law, I mean, they entertain quite a bit, and she does -- she sets a table magnificently.</span> <span id="s1643">And that endears her to me greatly.</span> <span id="s1644">And it means a lot.</span> <span id="s1645">I don’t know, maybe because it brings memories of my past.</span> <span id="s1646">But I have come -- I don’t know, I’ve not made peace, because I still have nightmares and awful things, but I think I’ve -- I have probably healed, cause I couldn’t have survived if tha -- if I hadn’t.</span> <span id="s1647">And I -- I -- my attitude, I have a good attitude, because I’ve been very lucky, I have a good man.</span> <span id="s1648">And I just hope he’ll be here forever for me, selfishly.</span> <span id="s1649">And I have a good son, we have two wonderful gray -- grandchildren.</span> <span id="s1650">And only health permitting, you know.</span> <span id="s1651">My husband is on a three months schedule and every three months when he goes back, my heart skips a beat.</span> <span id="s1652">But life goes on and you have to smile and put on a happy face and be happy, even if it’s pretending.</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">Q: Let’s take a break now and get something to eat.</span> <span id="s1654">[tape break].</span> <span id="s1655">Here we are, we’re back from a break.</span> <span id="s1656">We were going to talk now about your decision in the early 80’s to speak out.</span> <span id="s1657">You mentioned before we took a break that there was a survivor’s conference or a gathering of some sort that you went to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">A: Yeah, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1659">Q: Why don’t you tell me about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1660">A: Well, yeah it was -- I think it was in 1983, and at that time my husband was out of the military, he had a new career, our son was in school, and -- already in college, I guess.</span> <span id="s1661">And I was settled.</span> <span id="s1662">In other words, we didn’t have to move again like in a year or so.</span> <span id="s1663">And all of a su -- not all of a sudden, but I was thinking it was time to try and reach out and get in touch with some -- to get a relationship with some other survivors, because I did not have it, traveling around, you know, all over the world, you know, being in the military.</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">Q: And did you feel the need for it, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1666">I felt -- no, I felt the need for -- I -- I didn’t feel the need for it, but I felt it was time.</span> <span id="s1667">It was time because I had no relationship with anyone -- with survivors, per se, and the only one was my girlfriend from Benzheim DP, with whom I corresponded, and she came, as a matter of fact, to visit us once with her family, in Springfield, when we still lived in Springfield.</span> <span id="s1668">She did get married, like you were mentioning, in -- at the DP camp, in Benzheim.</span> <span id="s1669">She married a -- a middle -- an older -- mostly it used to be, you know, older men.</span> <span id="s1670">She married a very nice, very fine fellow, and he had a brother, and af -- the brother had also a family and they all -- they all emigrated to America together.</span> <span id="s1671">And my friend’s -- Rya is her name -- Rya’s mother was still alive.</span> <span id="s1672">And all of them ended up in the United States, I think about a year before I did.</span> <span id="s1673">How they were able to do that, I don’t know, but sh-she was the only one I kept in touch with.</span> <span id="s1674">And at that time it wasn’t that I felt the need for it, I just felt it was time to get in touch in with other survivors.</span> <span id="s1675">Maybe it was a need, I don’t know, but I felt it was time because I was in one place and I wasn’t going to go overseas again.</span> <span id="s1676">And so when the time came, as it was, there was going to be, I think the first gathering of survivors in Washington, D.C., and I think it was 1983, and I attended it.</span> <span id="s1677">It was not quite a week, but it was more than one day, I don’t recall exactly.</span> <span id="s1678">And there I met many new people, and some whom I have known from the DP camps, and it was nice to be together.</span> <span id="s1679">It was a rather emotional and solemn gathering.</span> <span id="s1680">And most of the people that I knew have settled and have also started their own lives and were successful in becoming Americanized.</span> <span id="s1681">After that meeting, which was several days, it lasted several days, I remember one thing very distinctly, I met -- forgot his first name, Rosenzaft is his name, he is the -- the was at that time, I think, the first second generation activist.</span> <span id="s1682">And he made a very emotional and very memorable speech at that meeting, and he was telling us -- he was -- he was born in Bergen-Belsen, where his parents ended up at the end of the war.</span> <span id="s1683">And when they said, I was born in Bergen-Belsen, people said, oh in a deep -- in a concentration camp?</span> <span id="s1684">No, at that time it was a DP camp.</span> <span id="s1685">But he was born in that camp, and he became very active and he still is.</span> <span id="s1686">I forgot his first name, but you know, that I remember from that meeting.</span> <span id="s1687">And after that meeting, things were quiet, but it’s sort of like -- it gave me a little seed in my mind.</span> <span id="s1688">I knew I had to do something, I didn’t know what, and I didn’t know what I was ready to do.</span> <span id="s1689">At that point we did belong to Agudas Achim and our friend Shelly Elster the rabbi, was still with us.</span> <span id="s1690">And I went to him and I said, I want to do something to honor the memory of all the ones, the millions who perished in the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1691">And he looked at me and right away he says, why don’t you become a Bat Mitzvah?</span> <span id="s1692">You know what a Bat Mitzvah is, I mean, here.</span> <span id="s1693">I said, oh, but I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1694">And Hebrew, I don’t know any prayers.</span> <span id="s1695">I mean, you know, I-I was really an ignoramus when it came to, you know, Hebrew reading, and chanting and all that.</span> <span id="s1696">He says, I’ll teach you.</span> <span id="s1697">That was, I think, in January.</span> <span id="s1698">In April that day -- that year, 1985, was Yom HaShoah, the you know, observance.</span> <span id="s1699">And they started observing -- at that time they did already observe it at the rotunda, you know, in the Capitol.</span> <span id="s1700">But our synagogue usually had sort of a religious school, you know, commemoration or something, not as elaborate and all, but just to commemorate.</span> <span id="s1701">And I said well, I don’t know, but if I -- I don’t think I could learn by April, you know, all the chanting and all the Haftorah and everything.</span> <span id="s1702">Cause I didn’t know any of the blessings in Hebrew, nothing.</span> <span id="s1703">Didn’t even know how to read.</span> <span id="s1704">And he says, I’ll teach you, and he proceeded to teach me.</span> <span id="s1705">And by April, to make it -- it was very difficult and it took an awful lot of time, and my husband said he could recite some of the prayers in his sleep because he heard me repeating them so many times.</span> <span id="s1706">And came f -- when -- when April came, I don’t remember what day, I think it was also the 25th or something, 21st or 25th, I was ready for my -- for becoming a Bat Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s1707">And I learned all the chanting and all this in the three months.</span> <span id="s1708">And that was very -- a very nice accomplishment.</span> <span id="s1709">I invited the entire congregation and actually some of my relatives from Columbus, Ohio and New York, and some of them came.</span> <span id="s1710">And they said later, they said, yeah we came because we felt sorry for you and we didn’t want you to fall on your face without family around.</span> <span id="s1711">Well, I didn’t fall on my face.</span> <span id="s1712">I astounded them all because I did the whole thing.</span> <span id="s1713">Usually kids, you know, learn from very beginning and then it takes them a year or so.</span> <span id="s1714">And I chanted it all and did a good job, if I must say so myself.</span> <span id="s1715">And after that we did attend synagogue pretty regularly, maybe not every Saturday or -- but around that time when I was preparing for my Bat Mitzvah, I did.</span> <span id="s1716">I wrote a poem for that occasion and I made -- and my remarks were centered around the theme that this is Yom HaShoah and I’d like -- this is my way of honoring all the millions who perished during the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1717">And it was -- I felt very good about it.</span> <span id="s1718">Well, at this time my wonderful rabbi was preparing kids for their confirmation class -- I mean for their graduation, they have Hebrew school and then, you know, religious school and then the people -- the students who want to go on after their bat mit -- Bar and Bat Mitzvah when -- they call them to confirmation class.</span> <span id="s1719">And he says, you must go and speak to my kids in confirmation class.</span> <span id="s1720">And I looked at him, I said, Shelly, I cannot do that.</span> <span id="s1721">I -- my English isn’t good.</span> <span id="s1722">I -- I -- I don’t have my story, you know, in -- in my head.</span> <span id="s1723">He says, I don’t care.</span> <span id="s1724">And that was a Sunday morning when he has a class.</span> <span id="s1725">He dragged me in and he says, I’ll give you questions and you answer.</span> <span id="s1726">And that was my first presentation, against my will.</span> <span id="s1727">I was petrified, and I mean, I -- I was not a public speaker, not that I am now, but I -- I -- it was very difficult and it was really, I mean, he pushed me and I was angry with him that he did.</span> <span id="s1728">But it was a wonderful beginning.</span> <span id="s1729">Not a wonderful, but a beginning of something that I realized I had to do.</span> <span id="s1730">And what I realized at that time -- I mean then, the next Sunday he had another class, and he says, well you keep on, you’ve done great and you’ll do even better.</span> <span id="s1731">You must -- and you know, the first time when I made this presentation, when I finished, I got sick to my stomach, you know, went and threw up.</span> <span id="s1732">But little by little, it was easier as time went on, and then I realized that this is what I have to do.</span> <span id="s1733">I have to bear witness, I have to share my experiences, especially with young people.</span> <span id="s1734">And Rabbi Elster gave me the push in the right direction, and because of him I started doing this.</span> <span id="s1735">And it grew from that one, first confirmation class.</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">Q: In that first class, did -- do you have a memory of the -- how the young people responded, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1737">A: They were -- they were stunned, because at that time there weren’t many people that went into details and all.</span> <span id="s1738">And I have one instance, the -- and this is something that people remember because it is so, I think, unusual.</span> <span id="s1739">I have an instance where there were seven of us ended up in a haystack, in a huge haystack.</span> <span id="s1740">And I think that -- and my whole presentation, centered around that fact.</span> <span id="s1741">And -- and I mean there were seven of us, and onl -- and I’m the only one who survived.</span> <span id="s1742">And after the presentation, the -- all these kids, or most of them, came around to give me a hug and to ask questions.</span> <span id="s1743">And it felt good.</span> <span id="s1744">It wasn’t a catharsis, but it felt as if this is what I have to do now.</span> <span id="s1745">My travels were over with, I wasn’t the military wife any more, and I had to do something else, and -- and that was the thing I had to do.</span> <span id="s1746">And this is the way it evolved and the strange or interesting thing is, as the years go by, it seems that a -- of course now I’m with the Speakers’ Bureau of the Holocaust Museum, and a lot of my gigs -- my si -- my presentations come through the museum, but I also have an awful lot of them that are by word of mouth, that people heard me, or they -- somebody said something, and they call me.</span> <span id="s1747">And I go back there maybe once a year for five or six or seven years, and lately now, from the museum, I’ve been sent all throughout the country to speak.</span> <span id="s1748">And like two years ago I was the guest speaker at the -- in Utah at Salt Lake City at the governor’s mansion, what do you call it, at the governor’s invitation and I made the keynote speech for Yom HaShoah.</span> <span id="s1749">I’ve been to a number of places, and military places, and I have now -- I have s -- a schedule all the way until, I think June, with many, you know, si -- some -- I think I’m going to Iowa and I’m going to -- just came back from South Dakota and Kentucky.</span> <span id="s1750">And the reception -- as the years go by -- the reception’s always been very cordial, but it seems that the students now, especially in high schools and middle schools, the students are much more knowledgeable because the teachers offer so much more information.</span> <span id="s1751">And that happens in turn because the museum and other places, I’m sure, too, offer so many wonderful courses that inform the teachers how to re -- how to teach the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s1752">Q: I remember -- excuse me -- in your oral history interview you mentioned you had been doing this for 10 years already in 1995.</span></p> <p><span id="s1753">A: Since 1985, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1754">Q: You -- you mentioned an early experience you had at a school where a parent --</span></p> <p><span id="s1755">A: Y-yeah, oh, well --</span></p> <p><span id="s1756">Q: -- questioned --</span></p> <p><span id="s1757">A: -- yeah, I had two instances --</span></p> <p><span id="s1758">Q: -- questioned your story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1759">A: -- I had two instances, negative instances in all the -- in all my experience --</span></p> <p><span id="s1760">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1761">A: -- you know, time that I’ve been speaking.</span> <span id="s1762">One was the one you referred to and it was at the Children’s Capital Museum, before the Holocaust Museum was built.</span> <span id="s1763">And at that time, I don’t know if you were here, and are you familiar with it, they had one section, and I th -- I think they called it -- they didn’t call it Daniel’s story, but it was, in essence, the composite of a young boy who lives through the horrors in Germany.</span> <span id="s1764">And it was -- bu -- I mean, Daniel’s story is that composite boy.</span> <span id="s1765">And what -- I don’t know i -- under whose auspice -- auspices this was, but they would bring students, young students, and I think some of them were, you know, still from elementary school.</span> <span id="s1766">They would bring them to that children’s museum, and they would let them go through the rooms and familiarize themselves with the story of this boy, Daniel.</span> <span id="s1767">And then when they finished listening to the description and going through the rooms, they -- each one would receive a tile, and they had to register their impressions with painting a statement.</span> <span id="s1768">And -- you know, they gave them paint and -- and the tiles.</span> <span id="s1769">And this one time there were two kids in that group, from two different classes, but the same school.</span> <span id="s1770">And of course they always had chaperones, and this father, this one man, came over to me.</span> <span id="s1771">I happened tha -- usually he -- when they had these presentations of Daniel’s story, they tried to get a survivor to finish off.</span> <span id="s1772">After the kids went through the story of Daniel, they would have a survivor speak about his or her own experiences, and that sort of finished off the program.</span> <span id="s1773">Well, it was my turn, because I participated in it, to speak that day and I got up, wherever it was, and there were all these kids, you know, sitting and listening to my story.</span> <span id="s1774">And I made it very simple, because it -- these were young kids.</span> <span id="s1775">But after I was finished this guy comes over, and there were several parents, obviously, you know, with the kids and they were always very nice and asked meaningful questions.</span> <span id="s1776">But this time this guy comes over and looks at me and first of all he says, now what’s your na -- hey, you, you know, what’s your name?</span> <span id="s1777">Usually I say, Charlene Schiff.</span> <span id="s1778">To him I said Mrs. Schiff, you know.</span> <span id="s1779">Already I sensed something wrong.</span> <span id="s1780">And he says, you know, Mrs. Schiff, come, come, all this is a figment of your imagination.</span> <span id="s1781">Just like that.</span> <span id="s1782">I wa -- I -- I was speechless for a minute, cause I di -- I -- I mean, I was completely taken by, you know, surprise.</span> <span id="s1783">And I said, how dare you say something like this to me?</span> <span id="s1784">And I said, do you think anybody would come up to bare one’s soul just to make up a story?</span> <span id="s1785">He said well, there was no Holocaust, and things like that.</span> <span id="s1786">That was my one exper -- and am -- I -- and I asked -- I said, well if you don’t believe that there was a Holocaust, why did you bring your two children -- not one, but two, two children, to this museum, to the Children’s museum.</span> <span id="s1787">He says, well, they -- they needed -- tha-that was a -- an outing, or whatever he called it, and a field trip and they needed a chaperone and I wasn’t working that day, so I said I’ll go.</span> <span id="s1788">Or in other words, he didn't even realize what they were going to see or hear.</span> <span id="s1789">And that was one instance.</span> <span id="s1790">And the other one was in a school.</span> <span id="s1791">And that was in a middle school in this area -- End of Tape Three, Side B Beginning Tape Four, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1792">Q: This is Charlene Schiff, tape four, side one.</span> <span id="s1793">Can you start again?</span> <span id="s1794">It happened here, in a local school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1795">A: Yes, in a -- a middle school, and usually what I try to do if it’s possible, I encourage the teachers to get several classed together so, you know, I can speak to more than one class.</span> <span id="s1796">And usually they honor my request if it’s possible.</span> <span id="s1797">In this school they did use the auditorium and there were about 500 kids or so, yeah.</span> <span id="s1798">The whole middle school.</span> <span id="s1799">And after my presentation I always ask to have a Q and A and the kids started raising their hands with questions.</span> <span id="s1800">And in the middle of this all, or you know, a few minutes after the questioning started, this one kid gets up and most of them were wearing very nice clothes, school clothes, you know, jeans and all.</span> <span id="s1801">This kid had a hat, what do you call it, a -- with the visor in the back.</span> <span id="s1802">I don’t know what you call it, but anyway, he looked like he was sort of a troublemaker.</span> <span id="s1803">Tall, good-looking kid, dark.</span> <span id="s1804">And he says, Miss Schiff, how many Jews were mur -- were killed?</span> <span id="s1805">How many Jews did you say were killed?</span> <span id="s1806">I said, I didn’t say.</span> <span id="s1807">I don’t ever like to take -- to say, you know, numbers, cause I -- you know, I’ll say 6,000, they say no, it was only 6001, or whatever.</span> <span id="s1808">I don’t give number -- I said I -- I didn’t say.</span> <span id="s1809">But how many would you say were killed?</span> <span id="s1810">And I said, well, there were six million Jews and five million others.</span> <span id="s1811">And I said, even one being killed was too many.</span> <span id="s1812">And he sort of took off his head and started scratching his -- took off his hat and started scratching his head and hair.</span> <span id="s1813">He said, well six million, maybe it was a few too many.</span> <span id="s1814">Just like that.</span> <span id="s1815">And I -- he was looking to see that people will start laughing.</span> <span id="s1816">It was dead silence.</span> <span id="s1817">I said, as far as I’m concerned, even one was too many.</span> <span id="s1818">And are you satisfied now that you made your joke?</span> <span id="s1819">Just like that.</span> <span id="s1820">And he says, it’s not a joke.</span> <span id="s1821">And I said yes, it is a joke.</span> <span id="s1822">And he was standing there.</span> <span id="s1823">And after I said, you know, tha -- you -- you finished with your joke or whatever, and even one is too many, the whole audience got up and started applauding and I got a standing ovation.</span> <span id="s1824">And at that time he walked out.</span> <span id="s1825">And then I found out he is -- he was from a Muslim f -- you know, household and his father was a Muslim and he came -- he would come to school always with very contradictory statements and all.</span> <span id="s1826">I wish the teachers had warned me.</span> <span id="s1827">I don’t know what I would had done differently, but nobody did until after it happened.</span> <span id="s1828">And those two instances were my only instances where it was unpleasant and traumatic, very traumatic.</span> <span id="s1829">But other than that, I never had that kind of an experience.</span> <span id="s1830">And as time progresses, which is again very, t-to me, of great interest, the interest in the Holocaust, and you know, history per se, you know, about World War II, the interest by young people increases every year.</span> <span id="s1831">I don’t know what to blame it on, or what to give cr -- credit, and especially now, after September 11th, it -- it is really amazing, and a -- I just came back from Kentucky, that’s my most recent gig, and I was amazed.</span> <span id="s1832">I spoke there in a high school and a middle school, two different schools, and the reception couldn’t have been more cordial.</span> <span id="s1833">It was -- it happened it was my birthday, and I n -- I ne -- I don’t know how they found out, but I guess from the internet, or whatever, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1834">Q: Watch your scarf there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1835">A: -- both schools had great big signs outside when I came in, happy birthday, Mrs. Schiff, happy birthday, Charlene.</span> <span id="s1836">They baked me a cake, they sang “Happy Birthday”, all 500 of them.</span> <span id="s1837">And i-it was in -- and the questions, if I had the time, if I didn’t have to catch a plane, I could have stayed there another day, they were so eager to learn more, and I had to promise them they would send me the questions and I’ll answer writing.</span> <span id="s1838">It’ll never happen, you know.</span> <span id="s1839">But it -- it -- and this is occurring everywhere.</span> <span id="s1840">So I -- I -- it’s not a catharsis for me, but I feel I’m doing the right thing at the right time.</span> <span id="s1841">This is my time to bear witness as long as I can stand up on my own two feet, and as long as I can still speak somewhat coherently and remember what transpired.</span> <span id="s1842">I think it’s very important for -- especially for the young people to know, and once we’re gone, it will be -- it’s wonderful that we have the museum, and it’s wonderful that that legacy is there, and the museum stands there as a warning that people shouldn’t tamper with human rights.</span> <span id="s1843">But it’s still not the same as when I -- a live person stands there and tells you what happened to him or her.</span> <span id="s1844">And that’s why I was -- I’m doing it, and it turns out it’s almost -- not quite, but almost a full time job, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1845">Q: Why do you say it’s not a catharsis for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1846">A: Because every day when I tell my story, I remember -- and now it’s getting hazy, but I remember new details, and it’s as if reliving everything that happened all over again.</span> <span id="s1847">It’s not a catharsis, no way.</span> <span id="s1848">Many times I -- I -- I went with David Klevin the other day to a school and I -- usually they allot me -- allow me to speak an hour, maybe two at the most.</span> <span id="s1849">And there, I think I was there 9:15, didn’t get out until one o’clock, because the kids had so many questions and they had the time from other subjects, they allowed them to stay, you know, and que -- question me.</span> <span id="s1850">And when I got home, you know what I did?</span> <span id="s1851">Went to bed.</span> <span id="s1852">I was emotionally drained and that happens a lot.</span> <span id="s1853">So it is not a catharsis, but it feels that -- it feels that I have to do it.</span> <span id="s1854">And that’s why I’m doing it.</span> <span id="s1855">I am a -- in our group, like the -- the group of child survivors, I preach whenever I go.</span> <span id="s1856">Now, I can’t even attend there the monthly -- we have monthly meetings, cause I’m so busy.</span> <span id="s1857">And a lot o-of my presentations are on Sundays, too.</span> <span id="s1858">I’ve had two or three churches.</span> <span id="s1859">Yesterday was an exception, wasn’t a Sunday, but usually it’s Sunday evening when I speak to the adults, you know, in -- in the churches.</span> <span id="s1860">And like yesterday, you know, I’m so glad it didn’t snow or rain, but their social hall, there was -- people were standing, there was no room in the seats to -- to accommodate everyone.</span> <span id="s1861">And that makes me feel good, but a catharsis it is not.</span> <span id="s1862">Absolutely not, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1863">Q: Tell me about your decision to become involved with the museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s1864">A: Well, since I’ve been speaking, you know, since 1985 and all, when the museum was built, and I remember that opening day, it was an April day, it was raining, it was cold and windy.</span> <span id="s1865">It was just like everyone else felt, you know, in their hearts.</span> <span id="s1866">That’s the way the weather was reflecting it.</span> <span id="s1867">And our son came down to be with us and to witness it, too.</span> <span id="s1868">And then I said, well gosh, I mean, the museum is here, let me see what I can do there.</span> <span id="s1869">I don’t think it was right when they opened, but a little later.</span> <span id="s1870">And then came -- John Minnick joined, and he is the director of the Speakers’ Bureau.</span> <span id="s1871">And I filled out some papers, and somebody said well, why don’t you go and become a -- work in the archives or start translating, you know, that’s a very interesting thing, you know, I could translate in several languages.</span> <span id="s1872">And then, I don’t know if I’m proficient any more, but at that time I thought, well, I’d rather be with people.</span> <span id="s1873">I want to do something where I’m not going to be by myself.</span> <span id="s1874">And that seemed -- you know, I was doing that anyway, I said well, maybe I should go an-and join the Speakers’ Bureau.</span> <span id="s1875">And the way it’s -- it fell into place, I don’t know if it was organized, I shouldn’t -- it’s not for me to criticize, but right now there are about 20 of us.</span> <span id="s1876">There are 64 survivors who work, who volunteer at the museum, 20 or so are with the Speakers’ Bureau, and maybe I’d better not say it.</span> <span id="s1877">You know what I’m -- was going to say.</span></p> <p><span id="s1878">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1879">A: But just -- I think a few of us work more than others, for good reasons.</span> <span id="s1880">And the thing is when I go to my meetings, the children’s -- the -- the child survivors meetings, I always have arguments with the rest of my friends and they all have become friends -- maybe not all, but some have become very close friends, and I say, why don’t you go out to speak?</span> <span id="s1881">We need a good mouthpiece.</span> <span id="s1882">And very few are interested in doing that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1883">Q: Well, this is what I wanted to ask you about next.</span></p> <p><span id="s1884">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1885">Q: What -- how do you understand that, that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1886">A: I don’t.</span> <span id="s1887">Well, I do and I don’t.</span> <span id="s1888">I mean, I started out, and I’m not a speaker, but I feel now that I -- I write out my remarks, mostly, because of being so sick when -- early on in my life.</span> <span id="s1889">Sometimes I start speaking and I’m at a loss for a word.</span> <span id="s1890">I cannot remember it.</span> <span id="s1891">But when I have it written out, I’m much more comfortable.</span> <span id="s1892">And I have several -- I have about -- every time I change a little bit and I have about 20 different formats.</span> <span id="s1893">One is 20 pages, one is 40 pages, you know, things like that.</span> <span id="s1894">Large letters, you know, so I can read.</span> <span id="s1895">But some people don’t know how to speak.</span> <span id="s1896">I didn’t either, but I felt a compulsion, that I -- a duty that I had to do it and so I learned.</span> <span id="s1897">Some of these people have selfish motives.</span> <span id="s1898">They don’t want to be remind -- reminded of their experiences, and they don’t want to have anything to do with it.</span> <span id="s1899">I remember one meeting we attended -- every year we have international meetings, that people from all over Israel and from Europe come to these meetings.</span> <span id="s1900">And every month we have our own meetings.</span> <span id="s1901">Once we had an international meeting, and I met two brothers from Connecticut, two brothers who survived the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1902">One brother talks about it all the time -- not all the time, but I mean, he is facing reality and his past.</span> <span id="s1903">The other guy is -- he -- it’s the first time he introduced him cause that was the first time he ever came to a meeting, that was an international meeting.</span> <span id="s1904">And he has never spoken about his experiences.</span> <span id="s1905">He’s married to an American woman who doesn’t know his past.</span> <span id="s1906">I mean, I don’t see how you can live with a person and not tell her your story.</span> <span id="s1907">But anyway, he doesn’t want to face it.</span> <span id="s1908">You know, he doesn’t want to go through again what he what -- what he lived through once.</span> <span id="s1909">So, I don’t know, I don’t know how to explain it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1910">Q: Hm.</span> <span id="s1911">How -- how is your -- how -- the [indecipherable] this group of child survivors, how is that group, other than the age difference, how is their view of the Holocaust and their -- as a group, their work in -- in talking about the Holocaust, how do you think it’s different from other survivor groups?</span></p> <p><span id="s1912">A: Well, it’s very different, to this day.</span> <span id="s1913">And that’s another ongoing, friendly discussion that we have.</span> <span id="s1914">Our group -- first of all, most of the members in our group are qui --</span></p> <p><span id="s1915">Q: What is the name of your group, by the way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1916">A: Child Survivors of the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s1917">Q: And is it a local kind of [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1918">A: Well, it’s not just the lo -- it’s -- it-it’s a -- we have, I think, about 30 or 45 different groups in the United States, in England, in -- all over the place.</span> <span id="s1919">And it’s stupid, then no -- again I’m using the word I shouldn’t, but it is, in a way childish to refer to ourselves, child survivor -- survivors.</span> <span id="s1920">Most of the people who survived were children.</span> <span id="s1921">Very few adults did survive.</span> <span id="s1922">But now none of us is a child, but we still refer to ourselves as child survivors.</span> <span id="s1923">The difference in these groups -- I don’t know if you’re familiar with Nessie Godin in th-the museum?</span> <span id="s1924">Who doesn’t know Nessie?</span> <span id="s1925">Her group -- I say her, she is the co-chairman of the group, is survivors and friends.</span> <span id="s1926">Their policy was from the beginning to open their -- I mean, they accept anyone who is interested in the cause of the Holocaust, or in -- in the theme, Holocaust, is welcome.</span> <span id="s1927">Our group, to this day, is -- I would call it almost like a hypochondriac cause, or case.</span> <span id="s1928">They feel, most of them do, God forbid anybody should join who is not a Holocaust survivor.</span> <span id="s1929">They’ll steal our secrets?</span> <span id="s1930">What will they do to us?</span> <span id="s1931">But they feel that they don’t want anyone but just the child survivors.</span> <span id="s1932">When I first joined, it was a very strange situation.</span> <span id="s1933">I came in with Ed, and they -- you know, I said, my name is Charlene Schiff, I’m a child survi -- who is that?</span> <span id="s1934">I said, my husband.</span> <span id="s1935">Is he a survivor?</span> <span id="s1936">No.</span> <span id="s1937">Out you go.</span> <span id="s1938">They wouldn’t allow him to stay, so I got up and I was going to go.</span> <span id="s1939">And I mean, eventually, after some debate and all, they magnanimously allowed my husband to come to the meetings.</span> <span id="s1940">Now, this situation has sort of evolved.</span> <span id="s1941">Now spouses, if they are not survivors, are allowed to come.</span> <span id="s1942">But it’s sort of a real closed group.</span> <span id="s1943">They don’t want to have any kind of relationship with anybody else.</span> <span id="s1944">And basically, until very recently, this group was a support group, let’s face it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1945">Q: Mm.</span> <span id="s1946">Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1947">A: And there’s some people who, 50 plus years later, still need that support.</span></p> <p><span id="s1948">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1949">A: There are many people who burst out in tears when they talk about their family that maybe one member perished and the rest of them are alive.</span> <span id="s1950">Their -- I mean, I -- I ha -- don’t have any tears any more since -- since I came to this country.</span> <span id="s1951">I -- I don’t know how to cry any more.</span> <span id="s1952">I don’t.</span> <span id="s1953">But when I speak, I divorce myself from my old self, cause otherwise I couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s1954">But these people are not strong enough, a lot of them, and they still need a lot of emotional support and they don’t want anyone else to know about their struggle and about their emotional weaknesses.</span> <span id="s1955">So that’s the way I would explain it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1956">Q: What do you mean though, Charlene, when you say you don’t have any tears any more, you don’t cry any more?</span> <span id="s1957">You’re very emotional --</span></p> <p><span id="s1958">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1959">Q: -- when you talk about -- at least on this tape --</span></p> <p><span id="s1960">A: I am, but I -- I -- I don’t -- I can’t cry easily and the thing wh-when -- when -- I cried when my friend’s husband died.</span> <span id="s1961">We said good-bye to him a mon -- a month -- an hour before he died, we were in his room.</span> <span id="s1962">For that I cried.</span> <span id="s1963">But when I think that my sister, who went to her death with her beloved -- I can’t cry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1964">Q: You mean you won’t let yourself.</span> <span id="s1965">Because you said when you came -- when you first came to Columbus, you cried every night --</span></p> <p><span id="s1966">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1967">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1968">Q: -- by yourself and -- but I -- I’m just trying to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1969">A: I was even considering --</span></p> <p><span id="s1970">Q: -- what you say --</span></p> <p><span id="s1971">A: -- I was considering going back to the DP camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1972">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s1973">You were so lonely?</span></p> <p><span id="s1974">A: I -- it wasn’t loneliness, it was just confusion and chaos and not knowing what’s ahead.</span> <span id="s1975">I shouldn’t have said that.</span> <span id="s1976">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s1977">Q: Does -- does this ability that you have or have learned, to speak in public, do you think it’s part of what gives you strength?</span></p> <p><span id="s1978">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s1979">I hate it when people tell me, oh you’re tough, you can do anything.</span> <span id="s1980">I am not tough.</span> <span id="s1981">It’s just that life has dealt me a very difficult hand, and I learned how to cope with it, and how to deal with it, partly because of my wonderful help from my husband and my son.</span> <span id="s1982">But I am not tough, and it’s -- and I’m not hard, but that’s the way people judge me.</span> <span id="s1983">I don’t like it at all, but I’ve heard it a lot, and I’m sure they mean it as a compliment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1984">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1985">A: But it’s not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1986">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1987">A: And I -- I don’t know how to explain it, but I -- even, you know, after I got married and things where -- were, you know, great, an-and there was -- you know, there were [indecipherable] and there was -- there were times when it was very difficult and all, but this is something that happens in everyone’s life.</span> <span id="s1988">And in a way I do understand my son’s philosophy and his approach to things, and he’s -- he accepts me as I am, and he doesn’t blame it on the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1989">That’s -- maybe I would have been this way without the Holocaust, who knows?</span> <span id="s1990">Pushy and very aggressive and very demanding where -- where my son, you know, was involved.</span> <span id="s1991">And now I realize that it was very probably wrong, but in spite of it all, it turned out okay.</span> <span id="s1992">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1993">Q: You mentioned September 11th.</span></p> <p><span id="s1994">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1995">Q: And talking in -- to groups of people after that.</span> <span id="s1996">There have been so many times in the past 20 years when there have been world events that I would think could be very upsetting to you.</span> <span id="s1997">Things like the war in the former Yugoslavia and the massacres in Rwanda, and the fighting in Chechnya, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1998">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1999">Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s2000">Q: Every time a minority of people is su-subjugated --</span></p> <p><span id="s2001">A: Was fighting for independence and for freedom.</span> <span id="s2002">Everywhere there is a fight for freedom, it churns within me.</span> <span id="s2003">But the reason I brought up September 11th, September 11th is unique in my mind for one reason only.</span> <span id="s2004">It was the first time that here in America we were touched on our soil.</span> <span id="s2005">And I think September 11th is very unfortunately important because we Americans were touched where it hurts us most.</span> <span id="s2006">It seems that until September 11th, all the other horrible, horrible situations in Rwanda, where the United Nations promised help, and I went to hear General -- I’m terrible with names -- Diddio.</span> <span id="s2007">The general who was in charge of the Rwanda, you know, contingent, and he was promised by the United Nations to get all the help he needed, and when he got to Rwanda, all he saw is death and destruction and massacre and not any help from the United Nations.</span> <span id="s2008">And consequently he resigned his post and became a drunk for awhile.</span> <span id="s2009">I mean, now he wrote a book and he speaks about this situation.</span> <span id="s2010">That churns within me and it makes me sick, physically ill.</span> <span id="s2011">All this, Bosnia and all that.</span> <span id="s2012">But to the American psyche, I think one of the most important thing, do anything, but don’t come to my beloved America, to my soil, on my soil.</span> <span id="s2013">Don’t do anything on my soil.</span> <span id="s2014">And sin the -- since the Civil War and all, all the wars were fought outside of the United States.</span> <span id="s2015">And September 11th, sadly, touched us right here.</span> <span id="s2016">And that’s why it’s so important to the Americans.</span> <span id="s2017">That’s the way I figure.</span> <span id="s2018">I also have seen something here that I was missing all these years.</span> <span id="s2019">We went to Israel, can’t remember when, in the 80’s, and the first thing that struck me was the fantastic pride and patriotism that the people have.</span> <span id="s2020">Maybe they’re not as observant, you know, religiously, but when they wore that uni -- wore th-the uniform of the military, they did it with pride, wearing it and holding their heads up high.</span> <span id="s2021">Here in America, when there is a war, God forbid, the military is regarded as one of us.</span> <span id="s2022">When there is no war, the military are second rate citizens.</span> <span id="s2023">The military is sort of an underclass, and it’s been that way ever since I came here and I -- and I was a military and still am a miri -- military wife and I’m very proud of it.</span> <span id="s2024">Since September 11th, you see stickers, I’m proud to be an American.</span> <span id="s2025">You see the flag on cars and I think it did awake our patriotism and our pride in being an American.</span> <span id="s2026">And it didn't do that when Chechnya started, when Bosnia started, when Uganda started, when -- when all these other terrible, you know, wars started su -- on a different soil, not on American soil.</span> <span id="s2027">And this is why I think it’s different.</span> <span id="s2028">I might be -- I’m probably very wrong, but this is my explanation.</span> <span id="s2029">And that’s why, until now, am -- most places, I always when I start my remarks, since September 11th, I start with the horrible tragedy of September 11th, and I compare it.</span> <span id="s2030">And I -- I do say it has no comparison to the Holocaust, but it is also driven by evil, by -- by people who hate, blind hate, and by people who have no regards for human life.</span> <span id="s2031">And this is one thing that we must fight for.</span> <span id="s2032">And I -- I have my four evil eyes, and I say even now, 55 years after the Holocaust, we must all fight the four evil eyes.</span> <span id="s2033">The evil of indifference, the evil of injustice, the evil of intolerance and the evil of ignorance, four eyes.</span> <span id="s2034">And the kids always write it down.</span></p> <p><span id="s2035">Q: I’m going to jump around a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s2036">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2037">Q: You mentioned that you traveled to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s2038">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2039">Q: What was that like for you to be there?</span></p> <p><span id="s2040">A: That was very, very emotional.</span> <span id="s2041">The reason it was emotional, first of all, we’ve made friends while here, with -- usually we try to find out who is here from Israel, and we became very good friends with the military attachés and the ambassadors and all, and they would stay here three years and then go back to Israel.</span> <span id="s2042">So we’ve had several and the last one, poor guy, he now has Parkinson’s.</span> <span id="s2043">But Hadassah and Jakov Granat and he was the military attaché here in Washington.</span> <span id="s2044">Can’t remember the years, it’s terrible.</span> <span id="s2045">But anyway, when we were visiting Israel, we got in touch with the Granats and we had a wonderful time visiting them.</span> <span id="s2046">And then I did get in touch with some people with whom I was -- I wasn’t in the same DP camp, but they were in a neighboring, there were so many of them.</span> <span id="s2047">And there was one guy there who was my father’s student.</span> <span id="s2048">And he ended up he didn't make it to Palestine, he ended up being caught and he ended up in the Polish army when the war started, and so he had a story of his own.</span> <span id="s2049">But when he came out after the war, he s -- found out that I was alive and he came to say hello.</span> <span id="s2050">And through me he met this other girl, who was in a different DP camp and they fell in love and they got married.</span> <span id="s2051">So we visited with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2052">Q: Let me turn the tape over now.</span> <span id="s2053">Hold that thought.</span></p> <p><span id="s2054">End of Tape Four, Side A Beginning Tape Four, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s2055">Q: This is Charlene Schiff, tape four, side two.</span></p> <p><span id="s2056">A: My God.</span></p> <p><span id="s2057">Q: You visited with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2058">A: Yes, I visited with them, and he gathered together other students and people who knew my parents.</span> <span id="s2059">Mostly my father’s former students, and they had -- I think I mentioned it before, they had a -- an evening where they paid tribute to my father -- my parents, but mostly my father, and reminisced and -- and told me s-stories that I didn’t know about my dad.</span> <span id="s2060">And it was very, very emotional, but also very nice, because they actually knew my parents and it’s something very, very dear to me.</span> <span id="s2061">So, and then we went sightseeing and we -- we didn’t stay there long enough.</span> <span id="s2062">We never did go to the southern part, to Eilat, but we had a private guide because I couldn’t walk very well, so we ha-had a car and a private guide.</span> <span id="s2063">And this guide turned out to be a retired military in the mili -- in -- in the -- in the Israeli military.</span> <span id="s2064">And so he and my husband hit it off very well.</span> <span id="s2065">It was a very nice visit in Israel.</span> <span id="s2066">I came home much stronger after that visit, it was good for me.</span> <span id="s2067">It was beautiful to see Israel, but you know, it’s amazing, not specifically in Israel, in Israel and in the United States, when I get off a plane, to this day, I feel like getting on my knees and kissing the ground.</span> <span id="s2068">Because the United States, no matter how we criticize it and all, it’s still the best -- best country in the world to live in, with our democracy and our freedoms and we should cherish them.</span> <span id="s2069">And so many times, most of us take it all for granted.</span> <span id="s2070">And Israel is to me a 20th century miracle.</span> <span id="s2071">When you drive through you see the desert and then all of a sudden there -- there are trees and there is water, and there are beautiful flowers, and there are fish, you know, and it -- it -- it’s just a miracle, a mirage.</span> <span id="s2072">And that again, I mean, is worth of getting down on your knees and kissing the ground.</span> <span id="s2073">And that’s the way I feel about the two countries.</span></p> <p><span id="s2074">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2075">This current round of violence in the middle -- in -- in -- in that part of the world must be hard.</span> <span id="s2076">It must be hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s2077">A: It’s very difficult.</span> <span id="s2078">And you know, all this violence, all over now, Chechnya is -- is an unresolved situation, and I mean Bosnia -- I don’t think -- it’s sort of, I think, quiet right now and all.</span> <span id="s2079">But there is so much hate, for hundreds of years, and I don’t think it’s really resolved a hundred percent, never will be.</span> <span id="s2080">And all the other places of unrest, and especially, especially Israel, it is something that is very, very sad.</span> <span id="s2081">And I know I feel very frustrated.</span> <span id="s2082">I’m not a politician, I’m not a political science major.</span> <span id="s2083">I don’t know how you resolve something like that, and especially now with Iraq, you know, and -- and hanging sort of like will it, or will it not?</span> <span id="s2084">What’s going to happen if it does and if it doesn’t?</span> <span id="s2085">It’s very difficult and I think -- I know we have some friends who never had any children, and one couple regrets it -- by choice.</span> <span id="s2086">And the other couple keeps repeating, even to this day, we’re glad we don’t have children.</span> <span id="s2087">We don’t want to have to leave our children in such a terrible world, where peace is at que -- in question every day.</span> <span id="s2088">And I don’t know, I -- I’m very glad that I have a child, and I have, hopefully, continuity.</span> <span id="s2089">But it is a question to ponder.</span> <span id="s2090">What are we leaving our children with, when we cannot guarantee them freedom, and freedom is what everyone until now has paid such a dear price for.</span></p> <p><span id="s2091">Q: You said in the -- in your oral history interview, you said a number of times though, that you feel hope.</span> <span id="s2092">You do feel hope for humankind.</span></p> <p><span id="s2093">A: Well I -- yes, I do, I still do, in spite of it all, because if I didn’t, I couldn’t go -- I never speak to the school kids, especially school kids, and adults too, without injecting some hope in my remarks.</span> <span id="s2094">I know nobody can live without hope.</span> <span id="s2095">You might as well give up.</span> <span id="s2096">And I know in my -- in -- in my darkest hours, no matter how I came to achieve it, if I tried, you know, to -- to just talk myself into it, but I always felt that I must have hope, and I have hope now.</span> <span id="s2097">And I think, I mean, it’s no comparison, but when my husband got so ill, I prayed to God and at that time I said, God, I -- I don’t care what you do, please give me hope that he’s going to go on and he’s going to live.</span> <span id="s2098">And I remember a very beautiful thing happened.</span> <span id="s2099">There was a Catholic priest -- they have a priest and a rabbi and all at the Walter Reed Hospital, and this priest just start -- just happened to pass when I was sitting there, and I mean, I wasn’t crying, but I was sitting in the corner waiting for some results.</span> <span id="s2100">And I was -- I looked very sad, and I think I was waiting for our son to come and I -- he says -- what -- what’s bothering you, my child?</span> <span id="s2101">And I told him.</span> <span id="s2102">And he says, I’ll pray for him he’ll be all right.</span> <span id="s2103">Yeah.</span> <span id="s2104">And that Christmas we went over and we gave him a nice donation.</span> <span id="s2105">He was there for -- he’s gone now, he’s gone someplace else.</span> <span id="s2106">But a Catholic priest, you know, had so much compassion.</span> <span id="s2107">That gives me hope, because there is something good in every human being.</span> <span id="s2108">And I also have another philosophy.</span> <span id="s2109">You know how women get together and they start gossiping and all, and I don’t like to gossip.</span> <span id="s2110">But I always say, if you don’t have anything nice to say, don’t say anything.</span> <span id="s2111">Say only when you have something nice to say, otherwise don’t.</span> <span id="s2112">And if you feel, you know, anger and all, try to concentrate and try to find something nice about that person.</span> <span id="s2113">And sometimes it’s very difficult to do that, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2114">Q: I remember in your first interview you ta -- describing how hopeful your mother led you to believe --</span></p> <p><span id="s2115">A: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2116">Q: -- that she was, whether or not she really was.</span></p> <p><span id="s2117">A: I never saw her cry.</span></p> <p><span id="s2118">Q: She was very strong.</span></p> <p><span id="s2119">A: But -- but sh -- you know, she turned gray overnight when they took my father away.</span></p> <p><span id="s2120">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2121">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2122">I should go over that and refresh some of what I said and some what I didn’t say.</span></p> <p><span id="s2123">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2124">A: But she -- she was -- and she wasn’t the only one.</span> <span id="s2125">It seems that most of the nourishment -- nourish -- nurturing befell to the women, because most of the men were gone right away.</span> <span id="s2126">And this was his -- Hitler’s plan, you know, take away the leaders and everything will fall apart.</span> <span id="s2127">And that’s what happened.</span> <span id="s2128">But the women came through gloriously.</span> <span id="s2129">And I know my mother kept spinning tales that -- I mean, now they are laughable I am sure, but everything that she -- that came out of her lips always ended with hope.</span> <span id="s2130">When they took my father away, both of us cried, my sister and I. And she gathered us -- she -- she hugged us, she didn’t say anything.</span> <span id="s2131">And later she was making plans, what kind of a party we’ll have when Papa would come home.</span> <span id="s2132">And, I mean, she always invited people, even in the ghetto, when she saw a little urchin, a little boy, or -- or a little girl by themselves, and there were lots of them, she says come and we’ll eat something.</span> <span id="s2133">And she was a genius at making soup, and she’d add more water and whatever, I don’t know, but everything she made, because we were hungry too, tasted so good.</span> <span id="s2134">And it was always shared with so much good feelings.</span> <span id="s2135">It wasn’t just oh gosh, we don’t have anything for tomorrow, you know, but well, we’ll have something tomorrow too.</span> <span id="s2136">Enjoy it, and eat, you know.</span> <span id="s2137">And it -- it was -- she gave us so much -- she gave me so much strength.</span> <span id="s2138">And I wish I could be one-tenth of the person that she was.</span> <span id="s2139">And sh-she was strong, and she was very wise, and she wasn’t the only one.</span> <span id="s2140">They -- she and a group of women organized a school for a -- for the kids who didn’t work, too young to work.</span> <span id="s2141">And there again, we could have lied about our age had we known ahead of time, but we didn’t.</span> <span id="s2142">But this too was such a wonderful gesture, to -- to be with the kids.</span> <span id="s2143">And -- and they were tired and beat, you know, from the work that they did all day, and yet they would come with smiles on their faces and sing happy songs for us, just to keep us occupied and to give us something to do.</span> <span id="s2144">Yes, my mother was a very special woman, but she wasn’t the only one.</span> <span id="s2145">I think ordinary people -- and my mother was not ordinary, she was extraordinary, but I think even ordinary people were made extraordinary by their circumstances in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s2146">And I mean, what befell us, you know, when the Germans came in, that people who were ordinary became heroes.</span> <span id="s2147">And that happened everywhere.</span> <span id="s2148">That’s another thing that I, nowadays feel very strongly about it, and I keep learning much more, is the fact that there was so much resistance, and there was so much -- there were uprisings, you know, all over the place.</span> <span id="s2149">Sobibor, Auschwitz, and of course, Warsaw.</span> <span id="s2150">But I was reading someplace just recently that there was resistance in 105 different ghettos.</span> <span id="s2151">And I think probably it will come up that it -- it was more than 105 ghettos.</span> <span id="s2152">Cause my mother’s school, that’s resistance.</span> <span id="s2153">The -- our kids getting together, about 20 of us, building a tunnel.</span> <span id="s2154">Tunnel, it wasn’t really a tunnel, but it was a tunnel.</span> <span id="s2155">That’s resistance.</span> <span id="s2156">And these kind of forms of resistance took place almost in every little ghetto.</span> <span id="s2157">And that is something that when we consider that there was practically no help from the outside, and even in -- in the Warsaw ghetto, how difficult it was to obtain weapons, and you know, how very -- even for money -- I mean, people would, on the outside, would promise you weapons, and then you would come and you’d find empty shells or you know, corroded things that didn’t work.</span> <span id="s2158">And when you think, that in spite of all of this, we were able to raise our voice, we should walk now with our heads high, too.</span> <span id="s2159">And I often say I’m very proud to be who I am.</span> <span id="s2160">I wouldn’t change it for the world.</span> <span id="s2161">And I am proud of being a Jew.</span> <span id="s2162">And I am proud of having to sur-survive -- of having survived.</span> <span id="s2163">But until recently, I had enormous guilt.</span> <span id="s2164">Now my guilt I’m trying to rationalize and chase it away.</span> <span id="s2165">Why should I feel guilty?</span> <span id="s2166">But I have felt great guilt.</span></p> <p><span id="s2167">Q: Ten years ago you said you felt imprisoned --</span></p> <p><span id="s2168">A: Guilt?</span></p> <p><span id="s2169">Q: -- imprisoned by your memories, in your guilt --</span></p> <p><span id="s2170">A: Oh, I’m still imprisoned by my memories, but I don’t feel guilt any more.</span> <span id="s2171">Maybe not -- I still feel a little bit, but not that much.</span></p> <p><span id="s2172">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2173">A: I felt enormous guilt for surviving.</span> <span id="s2174">Why me?</span> <span id="s2175">A nobody like me when people who had so much to contribute to human kind were just blown away like flies.</span> <span id="s2176">Why me?</span> <span id="s2177">So that’s why I feel very strongly that I must do what I can in my own small way.</span> <span id="s2178">I’m not Elie Wiesel, whom I met a number of times and just recently had an occasion to be at this table at a luncheon, which was very interesting.</span> <span id="s2179">But in my own way, I have to contribute what I can, and this is my contribution.</span></p> <p><span id="s2180">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2181">Let’s -- I need -- I need to take a break for a sec -- [tape break] -- 10 years ago, you were still looking for answers about what happened to your father and mother.</span> <span id="s2182">And has there been, in the 10 years --</span></p> <p><span id="s2183">A: Any resolution.</span></p> <p><span id="s2184">Q: -- any more information?</span></p> <p><span id="s2185">A: Well, you know, I went back to my hometown and that was a disaster.</span> <span id="s2186">As I said, my sister apparently was shot then and there, I don’t know what day, or -- but, during the liquidation.</span> <span id="s2187">My father, at first they told me he was -- he pa -- I guess the people in my town -- excuse me, that he went to Dachau, the concentration -- Dachau concentration camp.</span> <span id="s2188">And when I was in the DP camp, and later when my husband and I were stationed in Munich -- excuse me -- we went to Dachau to search all the papers.</span> <span id="s2189">Didn’t find anything.</span> <span id="s2190">And then, when I went in 1988 to my hometown, I was told that the 300 leaders were led from our hometown to the outside of the town to a -- one of the forests, there are lots of forests around.</span> <span id="s2191">I don’t know if they kept them one day or two or three.</span> <span id="s2192">They made them dig a mass grave and then they shot them there and then.</span> <span id="s2193">I don’t know which is the true story.</span> <span id="s2194">I did not see the grave.</span> <span id="s2195">I hope before I die I will go back to my hometown and have answers to some of these burning questions.</span> <span id="s2196">Maybe not all of them, but some.</span> <span id="s2197">If there is a grave, I feel that’s probably where he lost his life.</span> <span id="s2198">I -- and if it’s so, I -- my aim is to put some plaques, memorial plaques where the ghetto was, which is now a leveled space, and I hope someone will show me the mass grave, and I could put some memorial plaque there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2199">Q: Do you have reason to believe that people there know where it is?</span> <span id="s2200">A: Oh yes, they do.</span> <span id="s2201">They told us they do, but we had no time to go there --</span></p> <p><span id="s2202">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2203">A: -- because I was given a limit of two hours to be there.</span> <span id="s2204">And the town was completely leveled.</span> <span id="s2205">My house is still there, which again doesn’t look like my house, but it was a very traumatic return to my hometown.</span> <span id="s2206">Nothing was the way I remembered it and most of the houses were gone and I don’t know, but my -- our theory is that there must have been some kind of a experiment which turned sour.</span> <span id="s2207">I’m not saying it was Chernobyl or anything, but -- I don’t know what it was, but something occurred in that little town of mine that leveled everything and there is nothing there now.</span> <span id="s2208">When we went in ’88, my husband tried to comfort me cause I was so upset with all this.</span> <span id="s2209">He says, well, you don’t see anything, let’s go and show me where the river is where you were hiding with your mama.</span> <span id="s2210">And I try -- I said, I -- I s -- I was so disoriented, and I asked the people there, where’s the river?</span> <span id="s2211">No more river, they diverted the river, too.</span> <span id="s2212">So, I mean, everything was so traumatic and so puzzling, to this day I don’t know if any of the facts or if anything they said is the truth, but I have to believe someone.</span> <span id="s2213">But there is, they told me, a mass grave outside of the city.</span></p> <p><span id="s2214">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2215">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2216">I should have gone through my statements from oral history, so I wouldn’t have probably repeated myself.</span></p>
