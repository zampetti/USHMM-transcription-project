id="s13">Q: We're on camera.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: Would you tell me your name please?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: My name is Lily Margules, and I was born April 19, 1924, in Vilno, Poland.</span> <span id="s17">Before the second world war, my name was Lily and this how I was known by all my friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: Would you tell me, Lily, about your parents and your family when you were a small child?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: Uh...I was...I had a very sheltered and pampered childhood.</span> <span id="s20">Both my parents were professionals.</span> <span id="s21">My father, David , was a self-made man.</span> <span id="s22">He was a registered pharmacist... uh...despite the...that he came from a poor religious family, he became very successful after he became a pharmacist.</span> <span id="s23">And he met my mother when he was in the University and both...they were students.</span> <span id="s24">She studied dentistry and she belonged to the upper class, upper middle class and my grandfather was not too happy where...about this marriage, but when my mother became a dentist and opened her own office, he consented and they got...they got married.</span> <span id="s25">My mother's name was .</span> <span id="s26">And she was really a very good professional, a very gracious lady, and a very good mother and wife.</span> <span id="s27">My parents belonged to this...this students that actually lived very...very actively participated in the Russian revolution and even when they became successful, they still spoke Russian at home and all...all the ideals about the equality and fraternity were very much imbedded in their minds and this...they embedded in us also.</span> <span id="s28">Despite that they worked very hard, there were always time for cultural events and they used to go the theatre there, a very nice college and they had an excellent social life.</span> <span id="s29">I had a younger sister that was born 4 years after us.</span> <span id="s30">Actually I was born on the street called 4 and my sister was born in the apartment and my mother's closet became too small and we moved to 38, which was...which was the apartment and office that I lived til the second war world II.</span> <span id="s31">I have very fond memories of my childhood, and my parents really tried their best to...to make us, me and my sister very happy.</span> <span id="s32">As soon as I was born I had a nanny and the nanny became a very big part of my life.</span> <span id="s33">And even my father who was the real father was afraid of my nanny because she became the boss.</span> <span id="s34">She adored my mother, but she actually was the only ones that stood up against my father and I..</span> <span id="s35">.</span> <span id="s36">it was sometimes when I used to go up and downstairs, it reminded me about her attitude, and her friends because every day she used to take me to the park.</span> <span id="s37">When I used to go to the park, I had to be dressed up...uh...like a little princess.</span> <span id="s38">I..</span> <span id="s39">.</span> <span id="s40">I had to wear a little hat, and I had to wear gloves and new shoes.</span> <span id="s41">And when she came there, she met all the other nannies and they were talking and gossiping about their ladies and their bosses what they do there and what they...and what they were and how they spent their evening.</span> <span id="s42">And one...one wanted to tell the life of their ladies more interesting than the other.</span> <span id="s43">If my nanny decided that the dress I was wearing this day was not good enough, she didn't even consult my father or my mother, she just went to the store where we had credit.</span> <span id="s44">She bought me material.</span> <span id="s45">She went to the dressmaker.</span> <span id="s46">She ordered a dress and this was it.</span> <span id="s47">And so my father got the bill and he asked what happened?</span> <span id="s48">How come you're spending so much money on little girls that will grow up?</span> <span id="s49">She used to say, "I cannot...I cannot allow my little girl look worse than any other one.</span> <span id="s50">Do you want us to be poor?</span> <span id="s51">Do you want people to think that we are poor?</span> <span id="s52">We have...we have to have appearances."</span> <span id="s53">And my father doesn't even say anything.</span> <span id="s54">When I had...when I was 6 years old, and my parents send me to a private school.</span> <span id="s55">This was a school that Jewish children used to go, but we were taught only Polish.</span> <span id="s56">And the name of the school was the Private Coeducational.</span> <span id="s57">It was called gymnasium, and it was a private co-educational school called .</span> <span id="s58">And it was located on the street on ll.</span> <span id="s59">It was a very exclusive school and I have very fond memories about it, because this teacher was a really dedicated and knowledgeable people.</span> <span id="s60">The atmosphere was very congenial and we had all the facility that very often I wish my children would have when they were growing up.</span> <span id="s61">Because we had slides, we had clinical laboratories, physical laboratories and we had the , and we used to really...had very nice nature trips.</span> <span id="s62">And the only thing what I cannot forget how we used to admire and respect our teacher who were really trying their best to make our life interesting and also the lessons that they teach were very exciting.</span> <span id="s63">When we studied about the French Revolution, they made like a mock judgment and we were discussing about , head rolled, and in no time we knew what was going on with...without worrying about the book.</span> <span id="s64">And this...I had a little...uh...I had a very big interest in reading, and very soon...as soon as I studied to...I knew how to read, my father on the suggestion of my mother took me to the library and then a new world opened before me because I started to read.</span> <span id="s65">I..</span> <span id="s66">.</span> <span id="s67">there were days that I had...I finished a book a day.</span> <span id="s68">Of course, in the beginning was just children's books, but a new world opened in front of me and my mother was very happy because she believed very strongly about culture.</span> <span id="s69">She used to drag me and my sister to all...to children theatres to ballet.</span> <span id="s70">We didn't have an opera, but we had an operata.</span> <span id="s71">And she really used to pump culture into us because she used to say...I remember it well, "that the person who doesn't appreciate the music or poetry or finest things of life is really half...half blind and half...hard of feelings, because this everything is free, and you have to really appreciate it.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Coming back to...one second to my mother, I have to tell you that she was my best friend and I was very proud of her because not only was she a big beauty and a real lady, I never saw her without a hat or a pair of gloves, but also she was a very compassionate person.</span> <span id="s73">She had a very big clientele, and I remember rich landowners coming in front of our house and with those little...uh...horse...horse and buggies, and...and those tall, strong, Polish men were just kissing my mother's hand because she was such a good dentist.</span> <span id="s74">And they used to bring all kinds of presents, but on the other hand the poor people around us knew if they have a toothache or they have a any problem, they just come, ring the bell and come to the office and my mother would never ask them how much they can pay.</span> <span id="s75">They pay how much they could, and if they couldn't pay it was alright also.</span> <span id="s76">So she always imbedded in our mind the concept of charity.</span> <span id="s77">This idyllic life lasted through 1935, and this was the time when I started to feel the wind of anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s78">My father...my father was working as a registered pharmacist in a very big pharmacy that was a government pharmacy from the social services.</span> <span id="s79">Every worker was involved in it.</span> <span id="s80">Only 3 Jewish pharmacists were working there.</span> <span id="s81">They were the students that were on top of the class.</span> <span id="s82">In 1935, my father was told and also his two colleagues that they have...in order to work there, they have to obtain a Masters Degree in pharmacy.</span> <span id="s83">Of course, they had no other choice.</span> <span id="s84">They studied...they were studying.</span> <span id="s85">I was a little girl.</span> <span id="s86">My father used to close himself in...in his bedroom and work and study.</span> <span id="s87">He used to go on field trips because the old fashioned pharmacist didn't go and just and pick up the medicine from the shelves.</span> <span id="s88">They have to prepare it.</span> <span id="s89">And finally when the tests came...uh...there was an oral test and there was a written test.</span> <span id="s90">The man...the professor that gave him the test was a known anti-Semite and my father was very afraid that he won't pass the test.</span> <span id="s91">But he passed the test with flying colors.</span> <span id="s92">The written test and the oral.</span> <span id="s93">And as he was getting up from the chair...he was practically by the door, after he...telling him about so many complicated chemicals formula and everything, all of sudden, the professor asked him, "David , and what is the chemical...uh...formula for carbonated water with the C2 03, and my father was so nervous and so upset that he got a mental block and he couldn't answer him.</span> <span id="s94">And he just didn't pass him.</span> <span id="s95">So, of course, he had to study enough and he went to Warsaw and after a short time we got the telegram he did pass it.</span> <span id="s96">But after a very short time, a decree came and Jews were not allowed to work as pharmacist in a government institution, and my father lost his job.</span> <span id="s97">I didn't tell you that my...my father had a brother and two sisters.</span> <span id="s98">And my...my grandparents on my father's side were very religious, very religious people, and my grandmother had 16 children but only four survived because...uh...the children were...died in the infancy, and after 12 children died, she.</span> <span id="s99">.</span> <span id="s100">there was...uh...folklore in our family telling us that she went to a very famous rabbi and the rabbi told her that he...that if you wanted your children to live, you have to dress them only in white.</span> <span id="s101">Even...only in white, even if they grew...grow up and be able to go to school.</span> <span id="s102">And when the child will ask you, "Mama, how come everybody dresses in all kinds of different colors and I'm wearing in white...I'm dressed in white," then you can take off and dress the child in any colors.</span> <span id="s103">And this what happened.</span> <span id="s104">And she...the 13 and the 14 and 15 and the 16th child survived because she kept them in white.</span> <span id="s105">And my...my father had a brother and two sisters.</span> <span id="s106">The...the...the...the younger brother immigrated to Argentina with one of the sisters went to the United States, and one of the sisters lived with her parents in Poland and this...this...I just wanted to mention it because this was something happening and we were talking about this in the family.</span> <span id="s107">And so coming back to 1935 when my father lost his job, we...my mother had a very close knit family.</span> <span id="s108">And, as I mentioned before, they were upper middle class, and they were six children, two brothers and four sisters.</span> <span id="s109">One sister, as a young girl, got married and immigrated to the United States.</span> <span id="s110">One sister got married to a very rich man that was a manufacturer of papers and...uh...my oldest, my mother's oldest sister was a registered nurse.</span> <span id="s111">Her name was Sonia Lipquwich Perski, and she was actually my second mother and my...my mother, as I mentioned you, mentioned to you, was also a professional.</span> <span id="s112">And they were a very knit families.</span> <span id="s113">The two brothers, one the older brother was a publisher of a Jewish paper in Kaunas, and the younger brother...his name was Soloman, was a dentist who didn't practice dentistry but opened a..</span> <span id="s114">.</span> <span id="s115">a business...uh...dental supplies for dentists and mechanics....and dental mechanics.</span> <span id="s116">When it happened, the whole family got together.</span> <span id="s117">It was like a family council and they decided that my father has to get to himself together and buy himself a pharmacy.</span> <span id="s118">He couldn't buy a pharmacy in Vilno, but they found for him a pharmacy in a small town called Soley, but then a very tragic thing occurred.</span> <span id="s119">They didn't want to sell a pharmacy to a Jewish pharmacist.</span> <span id="s120">So imagine a pharmacist, a Christian of Polish persuasion had to be found, a sum of money collected by the family had to given to him and his name the pharmacy was bought.</span> <span id="s121">This happened in 1938.</span> <span id="s122">And my...my...actually my family split because my mother and my sister had to go to Soley and find an apartment near the pharmacy for my father and we stayed in Poland because my...we were going to school, and my mother was practicing in Vilno.</span> <span id="s123">And this was the time that the very tragic event occurred.</span> <span id="s124">My mother got sick.</span> <span id="s125">My mother developed cancer, and when my father took her to the doctor and she was operated on in one of the best hospitals in Vilno, she was...she was opened and closed and the professor told my father that she had 6 months to live.</span> <span id="s126">The cancer spread all over her body and you have two little girls.</span> <span id="s127">You have to live.</span> <span id="s128">But no...don't count on your wife.</span> <span id="s129">It was a terrible tragedy for us.</span> <span id="s130">We were, as children, not told about it.</span> <span id="s131">And the only thing that...that we knew that she was going for treatment.</span> <span id="s132">Then it was cobalt treatments and she used to feel really very bad but a little miracle happened because after 6 months she went into remission and she even started to practice because her patients were so dedicated to her that they...we had to take off the bell from the door because everybody would come and just wanted to find out how she is doing.</span> <span id="s133">Now I have to tell a little story about our dog.</span> <span id="s134">We had a dog called Rex, which is in...with the in Latin.</span> <span id="s135">And we actually grew up with the dog because when I was born, my parents bought this dog and she was our best friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">The dog always when we used to eat at home, the dog was stay in the dining room under the table we used to throw him the best morsels.</span> <span id="s137">The only thing if...when the dog was not present when the guests came and my parents were entertaining their colleagues, it was a thing in our family that the...that the children had to be seen but not heard, and they had to disappear together with the dog.</span> <span id="s138">My...when my mother got sick and she was lying in bed, the dog was sitting near here and there was no power that you should take away the dog from her bed.</span> <span id="s139">The only thing that he used to go...he used to go to the kitchen when he ...where he had his dish to eat.</span> <span id="s140">And he would eat, drink a little water and lie on his little pillow near my mother.</span> <span id="s141">And the dog...when my mother didn't survive, this what...we felt actually the tragedy in my young life because on May the 22st, the 24th 1939, my mother passed away.</span> <span id="s142">And it was something unbelievable because I was sleeping and all of a sudden I was wakened up by the howling of the dog.</span> <span id="s143">When my mother passed away, the...the dog started to howl so strong that they had to take him out from the house with the...with the force.</span> <span id="s144">And it was such a big tragedy for me because I adored my mother.</span> <span id="s145">I was proud of her.</span> <span id="s146">The best day of the week was for me Friday because she wasn't working, and she used to take us to all the functions and used to...she used to take us to the park.</span> <span id="s147">And I was so proud of her because she really was so beautiful that strange men used to tip their hats for her...uh.</span> <span id="s148">.</span> <span id="s149">say to her, call her like princess or madonna or queen.</span> <span id="s150">And I was so proud of it all.</span> <span id="s151">My...this is my mother!</span> <span id="s152">So it was a terrible tragedy for me.</span> <span id="s153">We had a tremendous funeral.</span> <span id="s154">All the children from my class and from my mother's class...uh...from my sister's class came.</span> <span id="s155">And so many colleagues and so many patients that we didn't even realize that she had...that she was known by so many people.</span> <span id="s156">And the dog wanted to go in this...in this cortege, but he was...the funeral cortege, but he was taken.</span> <span id="s157">When I came home from the funeral, I was very broken up and I really was so desperate that I thought that the...that the world is finished for me.</span> <span id="s158">And I remember it was May...May is a beautiful month in...in Vilno because all the lilacs are growing and the air is just perfumated with jasmine and lilacs.</span> <span id="s159">It is the most beautiful time of the year.</span> <span id="s160">So on a Saturday when my little friends took me out and we were walking through the streets and the sun was shining and the birds were singing and I said to my God, "The life is going on and my mother is not any more with us."</span> <span id="s161">I couldn't find peace.</span> <span id="s162">My teachers came to visit me and I was a very good student.</span> <span id="s163">Have to remember I was a teacher's pet and studying was very easy for me.</span> <span id="s164">And all of a sudden...uh...my grades fell down and my teachers when they came to me, they said to me, "You have to study.</span> <span id="s165">You have to take yourself together."</span> <span id="s166">And I told them, "I don't have nothing to...anymore studying.</span> <span id="s167">I having nothing to live anymore and the writings, articles to the papers because each class had a class paper.</span> <span id="s168">Was a time even when I was a publisher, an editor actually of the paper and the best article from this paper used to go to a school paper.</span> <span id="s169">It was called The Student's Friend.</span> <span id="s170">And it was the only school in the whole city that had a printed paper from...from the students.</span> <span id="s171">It was a fascinating paper.</span> <span id="s172">Oh...sometimes if I..</span> <span id="s173">.</span> <span id="s174">when I remember myself about, I said, "How come they were so serious about the event?</span> <span id="s175">How come we understood so much?"</span> <span id="s176">And I was really surprised.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: Can you tell us.</span> <span id="s178">Let's...let's move forward a little bit if you could.</span> <span id="s179">A Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: Can you tell us what happened now?</span> <span id="s181">After your mother's death and the war broke out.</span> <span id="s182">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: Can you tell us.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: Well, afterwards we...uh...we went...it was summer vacation, and we went to live with my father and my Aunt Sonia came and she stayed with us a month.</span> <span id="s185">She kind of became our surrogate mother because she felt...she felt that it was really a big tragedy for both of us.</span> <span id="s186">And...and we had a very sad summer, but actually did...uh...the whole world fall apart...fell apart for us on September 1, 1939.</span> <span id="s187">I was sitting in my room and preparing actually myself to go to school because I was supposed to go back to Vilno to continue study.</span> <span id="s188">And then my nanny came running into the room and said that my father wants to see us immediately in the pharmacy.</span> <span id="s189">And me and my sister and my nanny were running, and my father said, "Sit down.</span> <span id="s190">The war broke out.</span> <span id="s191">.</span> <span id="s192">broke...break...broke out.</span> <span id="s193">The Germans just invaded Poland, and we don't know what to do...be, but don't think about going back."</span> <span id="s194">And then it started.</span> <span id="s195">It...it started because the...the little town where I was belonged to Russia.</span> <span id="s196">I couldn't go back to Vilno.</span> <span id="s197">I was sent.</span> <span id="s198">.</span> <span id="s199">uh.</span> <span id="s200">.</span> <span id="s201">to school in a..</span> <span id="s202">.</span> <span id="s203">in a town called Oshmeyania where I was studying and my sister stood with my father and this to...this was till 1940.</span> <span id="s204">1940 during the vacation... uh...vacation time, I went back to Vilno and I stood in the house of my aunt.</span> <span id="s205">And I went to visit my friends.</span> <span id="s206">This was really a very sad situation because the whole class fell apart when the all 45 children, some went to one school that was teaching Pole...in Polish.</span> <span id="s207">The other one...Vilno became a part of Lithuania.</span> <span id="s208">It was...uh...it was very important for the Lithuanian to teach their children Lithuian...Lithuania so they had to teach Lithuanian and some of them went to Russian school.</span> <span id="s209">And very...it was a big rumor and very, very soon on June 1941, we were taken over by the Germans.</span> <span id="s210">When we were...we were taken over by the German, there were...there were...we actually...the part that we were...were...at the Russian occupation, and there was...uh...a truck standing in front of our pharmacy and there were Russian doctors that were asking my father to join him and go back to Russia before the German occupied, but my father said that in a war you have to have a roof under your head and he didn't want abandon it.</span> <span id="s211">And very soon the German came.</span> <span id="s212">I will never forget the...when the German came to the little town and right away, they segregated the Jews.</span> <span id="s213">They started to persecute Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">The Polish people were very belligerent, and they start a kind of pogrom, and one of the rich landowners came to my father and said to him that you should, that he will be sent...some people they would take our belongings and he will give us shelter...he will give us shelter in his little...it was like not a big castle, but a small castle.</span> <span id="s215">And he said because he was very good when the Communists persecuted him as a landowner in Russia.</span> <span id="s216">And my father and my sister went and I was sitting here with the other belongings.</span> <span id="s217">As it happened on the way, they were attacked by Polish peasant who robbed my father, put him against a tree, shot him in front of my sister, and my sister became hysterical.</span> <span id="s218">She was just a little, little girl there.</span> <span id="s219">They kind of let him go.</span> <span id="s220">And my father and my sister walked a long time and they came back and we...we had to escape from there because the...the...not only...not only the German were after us, but the Polish peasants were after the Jews.</span> <span id="s221">And we.</span> <span id="s222">.</span> <span id="s223">we took shelter in a Rabbi's house and my father arranged with a peasant, he took us to Vilno, as two little peasant girls to my Aunt's house.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: Tell us...tell us...can you describe that journey for us?</span> <span id="s225">Tell us...tell us what it was like for you as a little girl escaping.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: Well, you know I will be Jewish so it was a very dangerous journey and we left very early.</span> <span id="s227">We were put on a wagon and we were put .</span> <span id="s228">And we were told to sit quiet and he put some hay over us.</span> <span id="s229">And nobody from the town knew that we were escaping.</span> <span id="s230">My father didn't want to go with us.</span> <span id="s231">He wanted to stay yet because he didn't want to endanger our lives.</span> <span id="s232">So we were...he left us on...just in the beginning of the town, and then in Vilno it was already a curfew.</span> <span id="s233">The Jews...uh...were given all kinds of edicts.</span> <span id="s234">They couldn't walk.</span> <span id="s235">Uh...They had just to walk in the .</span> <span id="s236">They couldn't walk on the sidewalk.</span> <span id="s237">They had to have arm...arm bands with the...uh...with the Jewish star, and they had arm bands in the front and in the back.</span> <span id="s238">They were a certain time that they could home.</span> <span id="s239">All the jewelry and all the values the radio were confiscated and every day, there were men taken to work and they never came back.</span> <span id="s240">So when I came to the outskirts from the Vilno, I..</span> <span id="s241">.</span> <span id="s242">I knew where my aunt lived, but I didn't know about all those things and to was very dangerous because I was walking on the sidewalk.</span> <span id="s243">But I didn't know how it happened, and when we...after a long, long journey, we finally arrived to my aunt's house and she looked at us like we would come from the...from Hell.</span> <span id="s244">She couldn't imagine that we came there.</span> <span id="s245">And then after a few days, my father came, also came.</span> <span id="s246">And we stayed with...with my aunt til September 6th, 1941.</span> <span id="s247">This was the day it was...the ghetto, Vilno ghetto was started.</span> <span id="s248">And I have to tell you the way the German organized the starting of Vilno ghetto.</span> <span id="s249">This was just amazing how much sadism and organization was involved in this.</span> <span id="s250">Vilno was a very cultural town and there were all kinds of layers of society, but there were...there were .</span> <span id="s251">There were people that were assimilated.</span> <span id="s252">There were people that were very much pro-Israel.</span> <span id="s253">There were people that were very much for...for Jewish culture.</span> <span id="s254">But there was one section that were poor Jewish people lived there.</span> <span id="s255">It was...the streets were...I remember .</span> <span id="s256">It was in the it was in the center of Vilno, and those Jews in the middle of the night were taken out from their homes and was taken in a place called Ponary.</span> <span id="s257">These are...Ponary is a big forest where mass graves still are there.</span> <span id="s258">And they were shot right there, and they made...their poor dwellings were made a place for the ghetto.</span> <span id="s259">So as I mentioned to you, it came a day when edict came and all the Jews had to abandon their possessions, their apartments, their homes, and they were taken to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s260">There were two ghettos.</span> <span id="s261">One...number 1 and number 2.</span> <span id="s262">The number 2 ghetto was liquidated in a very short time.</span> <span id="s263">When I say liquidated, all the people were taken again to Ponary.</span> <span id="s264">Some of them were shot on the way, and some of them were shot in the mass graves.</span> <span id="s265">I happen to be in the second ghetto.</span> <span id="s266">When we came to the ghetto, it was a very terrible experience because we were carrying with us our meager possessions and the Poles lined up on the street and when they saw somebody of us wearing two coats, they used to say, "Aw, look at this Jew.</span> <span id="s267">She is...he is wearing two coats.</span> <span id="s268">Let's take one of them off."</span> <span id="s269">And they would just grab and take it away, and there and nobody even interfered.</span> <span id="s270">The conditions in ghetto were terrible.</span> <span id="s271">One family was put on in...two or three families were put on one room.</span> <span id="s272">The cold and the hunger and no sanitary conditions, and no facilities to cook.</span> <span id="s273">It was just...it was just a very dark era in our lives.</span> <span id="s274">Uh... right away, the.</span> <span id="s275">.</span> <span id="s276">the Germans put a wall and there were gates and you could only go out from the ghetto if you had...if you had a work permit.</span> <span id="s277">All you could only actually survive if you worked because the...the portions of the...the Russians are very...very meager and people were very anxious to work.</span> <span id="s278">The...the...in the ghetto inside, there were...Jews organized a Judenrat.</span> <span id="s279">This is...was a..</span> <span id="s280">.</span> <span id="s281">this was actually like...uh...uh...organization for Jews for social services, for...for helping each other, for organization and also they're the Jewish policeman that was standing by the ghetto.</span> <span id="s282">There was a..</span> <span id="s283">.</span> <span id="s284">uh...talking about me, I went one day to Judenrat because we had to survive and I was lucky to get a job.</span> <span id="s285">There was a German asking young girls...put them...if they want to work, put them into a column and we were...after a long walk, we find ourselves on the airport of Polobonic.</span> <span id="s286">And this airport of Polobonic our job was unload the wagons with big chunks of coal or potatoes or also wintertime we had to clean the airport.</span> <span id="s287">And we usually, we worked really very hard because the work was very long and the conditions for working was so bad there was always a German with.</span> <span id="s288">.</span> <span id="s289">uh... how you call it?</span> <span id="s290">The one that who used the horses.</span> <span id="s291">(laughing) standing behind you and you had to work and...and we really were miserable.</span> <span id="s292">At night when we used to come to the gates...gates of ghetto, we were practically exhausted.</span> <span id="s293">But the only way we could help ourselves because we could steal a little potatoes from the wagons, and when we came we could cook them.</span> <span id="s294">And sometimes we had...we had the chance to cook a little potato.</span> <span id="s295">We didn't have salt right there on the .</span></p> <p><span id="s296">They...they...they used...they used to let us.</span> <span id="s297">My father got a job in the pharmacy of the Judenrat...of the Judenrat, was like a Jewish government because in the section of the ghetto there was also a Jewish hospital and they had the pharmacy.</span> <span id="s298">My aunt worked in the hospital and my sister was just a little girl.</span> <span id="s299">And she...she doesn't even work and she was just very miserable in...in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s300">She became actually smaller than she was, and when I used to bring a few potatoes it was a big treasure for her because the Russians were very meager.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">But I have to tell you that there was a cultural life in Vilno ghetto.</span> <span id="s302">They were a lot of songs written, a lot of poems written.</span> <span id="s303">There was even a cafe.</span> <span id="s304">I never went there.</span> <span id="s305">There were...were theatres, and people really were trying to survive.</span> <span id="s306">Very soon, there was resistance...resistant organization formed.</span> <span id="s307">And those resistance young boys and girls became active.</span> <span id="s308">It was a very friendly sign because you could get shot on a..</span> <span id="s309">.</span> <span id="s310">but some how...some how they functioned.</span> <span id="s311">And they were trying to get out as much as possible Jews from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s312">But in order to get out from the ghetto and become a partisan and they were located in the Runigso and Narah forests.</span> <span id="s313">They...you had to have a gun and gun...a gun was very expensive.</span> <span id="s314">When my family came to the...to the ghetto, we were very poor because everything was taken away from us.</span> <span id="s315">All of a sudden we found ourselves really without any fund...funds to survive.</span> <span id="s316">You could...for money, you could buy some food.</span> <span id="s317">You could buy some clothes.</span> <span id="s318">We didn't...we didn't have it.</span> <span id="s319">So no matter how my father wanted us to escape to ...to the partisans, we had no means.</span> <span id="s320">I..</span> <span id="s321">.</span> <span id="s322">after...uh... when...you want...there is a poem that was written by one of the girls that used to walk everyday with me to the Polo barrack, and if you wanted I can read it for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: Read it.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: The poem is in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s325">And it...it was written by...by a really...a little girl and she said like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: Tell us...if you would, tell us what does the poem say in English.</span> <span id="s327">Can you translate it for us?</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s329">The poem say it is enough.</span> <span id="s330">It is enough.</span> <span id="s331">Every day this...our shoes are walking on this hard cobblestone, and our...and our feet in the...in the shoes are getting very tired to...to go those kind of distances, and we are walking and we are asking...we are asking, "Has the world forgotten about us?</span> <span id="s332">, and we are begging and saying, "It is enough.</span> <span id="s333">It is enough.</span> <span id="s334">We have no strength to walk in our shoes on those hard cobblestones."</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: Tell us about the girl who wrote this.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: This was...this was just a school girl that was very...uh...I don't...I am not sure if she wrote anything more, but she...I became very friendly with her and one morning when I came to work she gave me a piece of paper and this here was the poem.</span> <span id="s337">I was very excited and I had all other little friends and was the .</span> <span id="s338">And all of us when we had a chance, we were sitting on this...on this tall, you know...uh...wagon full of stone...full of those big pieces of...uh...of...uh...big pieces of coal that we had to unload and we stopped and we were all reading this poem, and the German guard started to scream and yell at us, "What are you doing?</span> <span id="s339">What is kind of this?"</span> <span id="s340">So right away we took this piece of paper and we put it inside you know, and we were afraid because they were...they were just beating us up for no reason.</span> <span id="s341">But some how girls made copies of this poem and many times we used to walk, you know, to work a bit and we used to recite it.</span> <span id="s342">And so in 1948, when I had a little...I came a little bit to myself, the first thing what I did I remembered the story...it was like written down in my heart.</span> <span id="s343">I wrote it down and I said, "Let me remember this.</span> <span id="s344">How we used to walk to work and we used to recite this poem because there is so much truth and so much pain and so much injustice asking, "How come this injustice was done to us."</span> <span id="s345">I just like people to know about it.</span> <span id="s346">Uh...I like to tell you about another very sad experience I had in ghetto.</span> <span id="s347">The job in ended and I..</span> <span id="s348">.</span> <span id="s349">one day I went again and they were asking people...the young girls, the women...uh.</span> <span id="s350">.</span> <span id="s351">for work.</span> <span id="s352">And I went there.</span> <span id="s353">And I was walking.</span> <span id="s354">I was very sad.</span> <span id="s355">And we were walking a long time on this hard cobblestone.</span> <span id="s356">They were very narrow streets in my...in my town.</span> <span id="s357">Everybody was just walking in a column in the middle.</span> <span id="s358">And then the column stopped and to my horror I saw that they stopped before the school that I used to spend and my...that I used to study as a child.</span> <span id="s359">It was the gymnasium .</span> <span id="s360">It was in 11.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">And this whole column was taken to a big...uh...a big...uh.</span> <span id="s362">.</span> <span id="s363">cellar, full of old and rotten potatoes.</span> <span id="s364">And our job was to sort out the potatoes because this was...our school was taken over by the Nazis and they...actually it was the Gestapo and they...all the classrooms and all the facilities were taken over, and they made offices.</span> <span id="s365">When I first came there, my first instinct was to just...forget about everything, and just run up to the classroom when I spent my...my childhood.</span> <span id="s366">And it was such a experience I had an impulse and I ran out from the column and the German right away took me back and gave me over my back, I came home with a..</span> <span id="s367">.</span> <span id="s368">a red sign all over and I was sitting right there and he told us to sort out the potatoes.</span> <span id="s369">As I was...uh.</span> <span id="s370">.</span> <span id="s371">coming every day, I met the janitor from our school and the janitor had two daughters.</span> <span id="s372">And would you believe that the first...the two daughters knew me as a child because I sat at this school as a 6 years old and I went til 1939, so they knew me every day.</span> <span id="s373">They used to help me with my galoshes.</span> <span id="s374">In the bad weather I used to share with them my lunch.</span> <span id="s375">And the first thing when they saw me, they said to me, "My God.</span> <span id="s376">I heard that all of you were dead.</span> <span id="s377">How come you're still alive?"</span> <span id="s378">They said their goodbye.</span> <span id="s379">This were their hello that I had from them.</span> <span id="s380">And we were working there, and also I met there one of my professors.</span> <span id="s381">My prof..</span> <span id="s382">.</span> <span id="s383">his name was Professor Moderstain.</span> <span id="s384">He actually...he was working there, tending to some chickens.</span> <span id="s385">He was my favorite teacher, and I don't think his mind worked alright.</span> <span id="s386">First of all, he didn't recognize me when I approached him.</span> <span id="s387">It was dangerous to approach a man because we were segregated.</span> <span id="s388">Women and men were segregated, but I approached him.</span> <span id="s389">And he was...and he was just talking to himself and then I was told that he saw his wife, his daughter, and his son shot in front of his eyes.</span> <span id="s390">So this was the only time that I saw him there.</span> <span id="s391">And imagine seeing this professor just sitting there and actually dancing, tending to some chickens.</span> <span id="s392">I..</span> <span id="s393">.</span> <span id="s394">uh...I developed...one day when I was working and I didn't have shoes, I developed an infections.</span> <span id="s395">And when I came to the ghetto door, it was already late at night, I stepped on a..</span> <span id="s396">.</span> <span id="s397">on a nail and the nail was rusted and the infection backed up, all the way up and I was...I got in my groin, I called a big boil and my father and my aunt saw it, they took the right away to the hospital.</span> <span id="s398">I was operated on and I was...I was in the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">In the meantime, when I was in the hospital I saw my father taken out from the pharmacy because the situation in ghetto became very dangerous.</span> <span id="s400">There were three kinds of workings papers in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s401">There was blue, yellow, and pink.</span> <span id="s402">The yellow one was a permit to work.</span> <span id="s403">The pink one was a permit for the children for the family of the working and the blue one was a temporary working paper.</span> <span id="s404">And many times in the ghetto, the Germans used to come in the middle of the night and they used to take out the people just for no reason and we never saw them again.</span> <span id="s405">People used to develop secret rooms, and once I was sitting in a secret room in a attic and I heard Jews being...being taken to...uh...to Ponary and I heard with my own music, violins playing.</span> <span id="s406">Because the Germans didn't want the...the people to panic or they didn't want them to...to escape or to resist them so they kind of put music...some musician in front of the column and this way they sooth their nerves and I heard...I heard the music.</span> <span id="s407">I was always thinking in case they will find me I..</span> <span id="s408">.</span> <span id="s409">I and my sister we have to go by the side, and we have to escape.</span> <span id="s410">We have to escape.</span> <span id="s411">We have to somehow run to the partisan.</span> <span id="s412">I don't...I don't want to be taken to Ponary.</span> <span id="s413">Because we knew what this was going on.</span> <span id="s414">That there were people were just shot and also we heard about the crematoria and we heard also about people from other places being taken to concentration camp.</span> <span id="s415">It...it was very strong rumor in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: You talked about a secret room.</span> <span id="s417">How did you get into this secret room?</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: As I told you, the dwellings in the ghetto were very old and there were mainly secret...many passages and many rooms that men used to put very heavy commodes or a big dressing...uh...piece of furniture and camouflage the door and behind the door there was a little room or a cellar or a attic and people used to just sit there all the time when the Germans, the Ukrainians, or the Lithuanians used to run to the ghetto and take anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Anybody!</span> <span id="s420">Able body!</span> <span id="s421">And they used to just take them quote unquote to work, but we no, never saw them again.</span> <span id="s422">One of my uncles was taken this way.</span> <span id="s423">I forgot...I..</span> <span id="s424">.</span> <span id="s425">just before, if I may come back.</span> <span id="s426">I forgot something if I may come back.</span> <span id="s427">On the day that we were taken to the ghetto...talking about my uncle.</span> <span id="s428">My Uncle Joseph Perski was a merchant who.</span> <span id="s429">.</span> <span id="s430">who traded in fresh and dried mushrooms, and had the last connections with Polish peasants and he doesn't...didn't look like a Jew.</span> <span id="s431">On the day that we were taken to the ghetto, he called my Aunt Sonia, and he told her that he is not going to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s432">He has a lot of connections and he will try to survive as an Aryan, and he asked her to join him.</span> <span id="s433">And she refused.</span> <span id="s434">She said to him she cannot do it because she promised my mother on her death bed that she will take care of me and my sister, and she cannot abandon them.</span> <span id="s435">So she asked him to take us.</span> <span id="s436">He couldn't.</span> <span id="s437">Because it was just...my father was also...my father looked very Jewish.</span> <span id="s438">We looked Jewish.</span> <span id="s439">He couldn't do it.</span> <span id="s440">So my mother...my mother...my second mother, my Aunt Sonia sacrificed her life for us because she refused to join him and she went to the ghetto with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">And she was like the pillar of strength for us.</span> <span id="s442">I would like to continue now about the last days of the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: Hold it.</span> <span id="s444">This is a good place to pause, but before we do that we had been talking about the secret room.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: Uh...I'd like to know how you go into a secret room.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: I got in the secret room because a friend of my father that used...that lived in the same apartment came...approached him one day and said that he and a few men found a place and they would like...they would like us also to join there.</span> <span id="s448">When they will...when they will hear there is a big commotion, and they are looking for men, my father should come right away from the hospital and we should all meet in the secret room.</span> <span id="s449">And the secret room was just behind a very tall...tall dresser.</span> <span id="s450">And you couldn't find it because they ...they....they used to go into the room, and the men used to put the dresser against the door and we would just sit there very, very quiet and listen for all the noises and...and then when everything's quiet down, a few hours later we would come out and then we will hearing crying.</span> <span id="s451">This mother was taken away and this father was taken away and this...and this is how...you see, and this is how the German was liquidating the ghetto.</span> <span id="s452">I have to tell you there is a very interesting story about the man in charge of the Vilno ghetto.</span> <span id="s453">Her name...his name was Jacob Genz.</span> <span id="s454">Jacob Genz was an officer in the Lithuanian army, married to a Christian Lithuanian, and he had a son with her.</span> <span id="s455">And when he became a commandant of the Vilno ghetto, he surrounded himself with a lot of policeman and officers that were Jews that escaped from Poland and were officers in the Polish army.</span> <span id="s456">They were all dressed as officers and they kind of were keeping peace and order inside the ghetto.</span> <span id="s457">Genz in my opinion did a lot of good for the Jewish population because he developed a certain rapport with the Germans.</span> <span id="s458">I remember there was...the commandant, the German commandant of the Vilno ghetto was called Weiss and he was an SS man, Gestapo and the...the commandant of the guard was Malver.</span> <span id="s459">When Malver was standing by the gates of ghetto, there was a massacre because he was just beating up people that were coming from work.</span> <span id="s460">Some of the people that came from outside tried to smuggle in some food, some a piece of bread, a potatoes, something to...to help their families in ghetto.</span> <span id="s461">They were starving.</span> <span id="s462">If he found somebody, he would just beat up.</span> <span id="s463">There were shootings.</span> <span id="s464">He was a living horror.</span> <span id="s465">And somehow he developed a rapport with them, and when they used to come to him and each time ask for more people, more people, he used to pacify them and he used to help.</span> <span id="s466">Help to maintain the stability of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s467">Very...very soon before the liquidation of the ghetto, the resistance started to send...to print all kinds of leaflets.</span> <span id="s468">Jews, the end is near.</span> <span id="s469">Don't go to the slaughter.</span> <span id="s470">You have to fight with what you can.</span> <span id="s471">If you don't have a gun, fight with ever...with a stone, with a knife, with ever you can.</span> <span id="s472">We will not survive anyhow, but we have to be resistant.</span> <span id="s473">But ...but people were brainwashed by the Germans, and really everybody was so involved in days of this struggle and was so weak and was...was so embroiled in this one thing, to survive that unfortunately inside the ghetto, there was not too much resistance when the time came.</span> <span id="s474">And I..</span> <span id="s475">.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s477">We're going to pause here and we're going to change tapes.</span> <span id="s478">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: One more question about the secret room and then we'll go on.</span> <span id="s481">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: When you were in the secret room, you told us about...that you heard people being taken to Ponary.</span> <span id="s483">Can you tell me what you actually saw?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: Well, I..</span> <span id="s485">.</span> <span id="s486">me and my sister, we were lying on the floor and there was just a little...a little opening.</span> <span id="s487">It was an attic and between the old wood, there was a very small opening.</span> <span id="s488">You really had to look with one eye because we were very afraid that we will be noticed.</span> <span id="s489">And when I heard this music, this fiddle playing, I..</span> <span id="s490">.</span> <span id="s491">I got very excited.</span> <span id="s492">I didn't know what kind...what kind of fiddle playing, so I put my eye to it and I saw fiddler playing in the front...in the front of the column and man, women and children were taken in columns, taken out through the streets of the ghetto, going toward the gates.</span> <span id="s493">And I with my own eyes heard...saw the people taken there.</span> <span id="s494">Women were crying.</span> <span id="s495">The women were carrying little children, and they were just...and I head the music and many times in my nightmares, I hear the music they were playing.</span> <span id="s496">And they were just walking very slowly toward the gate of ghetto, and the only way to...where they were taken...this was just only one direction, was Ponary.</span> <span id="s497">This was the only...the only place they were taken.</span> <span id="s498">And I heard...there was a woman that escaped from there.</span> <span id="s499">When I was in the hospital, she escaped from there and she was in the hospital, and she was telling us that they were told to...to make their own graves, and they were shot indiscriminately.</span> <span id="s500">The only way she survived because there were so many bodies on top on her she wasn't shot, and then she crawled in the middle of the night and she got...put...just went from one place to another and she...she didn't know what to do so she came back to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s501">There were a lot of people that actually didn't believe her, but I with my own ears I saw this woman.</span> <span id="s502">I heard that she lost her mind later on...uh...because when she was talking about it, she was in tremendous shock.</span> <span id="s503">But I..</span> <span id="s504">.</span> <span id="s505">this what I heard that she lost her mind and she was just babbling away later on.</span> <span id="s506">I don't know what happened to her.</span> <span id="s507">But this was...I heard and saw her when I was in the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s509">Thank you.</span> <span id="s510">Tell us about the liquidation of the Vilno ghetto.</span> <span id="s511">What happened to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: Uh...I was in the hospital and I..</span> <span id="s513">.</span> <span id="s514">I had this big...big inflammation and I..</span> <span id="s515">.</span> <span id="s516">since my physical conditions was very poor, I had this big opening that did...was full of pus and didn't...didn't heal.</span> <span id="s517">And so I was really...my prognosis were really very bad, but...uh...one day it was a few days...must be before the liquidation to the Vilno Ghetto, my aunt who was a nurse came into my room and she said that she heard rumors that the German gave against our commandant, you know, to mark them that they need more Jews.</span> <span id="s518">So possibly for work.</span> <span id="s519">And he decided instead of giving young, able bodies, he will take us all the sick people from the hospital and just to have the count.</span> <span id="s520">So she.</span> <span id="s521">.</span> <span id="s522">she told me she'll help me to get dressed and in the middle of the night, we left the hospital and it is just one of the things all of a sudden I..</span> <span id="s523">.</span> <span id="s524">I..</span> <span id="s525">.</span> <span id="s526">I walked and we went to our place where we...where she...where we were living, and she started to take care of her...herself of me.</span> <span id="s527">And she was changing the bandages and in...in a few days, it was September 23, 1943, in the middle of the night we were waken up by...by a friend of ours that always took us to the secret place to the Malini, and he said that even our father is not with us, he will take care of us and he want us to go with him because he heard from a friend that is a policeman, a Jewish policeman that this...this is the.</span> <span id="s528">.</span> <span id="s529">the morning that they will take out all the Jews from Vilno Ghetto.</span> <span id="s530">I just wanted to point out that the Vilno Ghetto had not only just from Vilno.</span> <span id="s531">There were...there were people from all over because in 1942, all the small ghettos around Vilno were liquidated.</span> <span id="s532">Means that the Jews were taken out and a lot of people escaped and settled down, so there was...was a big conglomeration of people in the Vilno...in the Vilno ghetto.</span> <span id="s533">But this...uh...the morning when...when the liquidation came, there was a just such a eerie feeling in the air.</span> <span id="s534">You could smell death.</span> <span id="s535">You could smell despair.</span> <span id="s536">You could smell helplessness.</span> <span id="s537">We were sitting in this room and between me and my sister and my aunt, we just had one little head of green cabbage.</span> <span id="s538">This were our provisions.</span> <span id="s539">And the man said that if we will survive that he will take us out and we will go someplace you know...uh...to...to some peasants to look shelter, even the Lithuanian were very anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s540">And then all of a sudden, there was this banging in the big door.</span> <span id="s541">The big piece of furniture, the commode, was pushed away and Ukrainian, Lithuanian, Polish, and a few Gestapo ran to the room and told us all, "Go out.</span> <span id="s542">Go out."</span> <span id="s543">And the Russian, the actual the Ukrainian were yelling, "Give us your...uh...give us your watches.</span> <span id="s544">Give us your jewelry."</span> <span id="s545">And in Russian, the watch...the watch is .</span> <span id="s546">So they were screaming, "Give us your ."</span> <span id="s547">And they were pushing us on the street.</span> <span id="s548">There is nothing we could do.</span> <span id="s549">On the streets were pandemonium.</span> <span id="s550">The few...the families started to be separated.</span> <span id="s551">The men were put in one column.</span> <span id="s552">The...the women were put in another column.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">The children were...were separated from their parents and there was such a intimidation that you just...you were...you were just had to look down.</span> <span id="s554">You couldn't even look up like a person after.</span> <span id="s555">Of course, all of us had those...had those bands and very slowly, we started to move out from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s556">I was walking my...with...my...my aunt was in the middle.</span> <span id="s557">My father wasn't with...not with us.</span> <span id="s558">I was...my aunt was in the middle and my sister was from one side and I was from the other side.</span> <span id="s559">As we were passing through the gates of ghetto, we turned around and this was the last time that I saw my town.</span> <span id="s560">And this was the last time that I..</span> <span id="s561">.</span> <span id="s562">that I actually...this was the last time that I actually saw the streets and of my childhood, so this was the end of my childhood.</span> <span id="s563">From this time, I became an adult.</span> <span id="s564">As we were passing the...the gates, my aunt had a beautiful voice.</span> <span id="s565">And I don't know...she walked like in a trance.</span> <span id="s566">And all of a sudden she started to sing this not loud, but sing, and we heard...what she was singing this song Vilno.</span> <span id="s567">It...I remembered always her singing us lullabies and all those happy songs.</span> <span id="s568">She sang in Russian, in Polish, but she was just going there and the fist was coming down and she was singing the song of Vilno.</span> <span id="s569">You want me to read it for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s570">It...it was written...it was written in Vilno ghetto.</span> <span id="s571">And it...the music is by and it goes like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">You want me to translate it?</span> <span id="s573">It says, Dear Le Vilno.</span> <span id="s574">Our town that we are born.</span> <span id="s575">Our...our dreams and our desires all went...only have and say your name.</span> <span id="s576">When they only have your name on our lips, we...we have to cry.</span> <span id="s577">We remember the...the Vilno streets, the Vilno...uh...uh...rivers.</span> <span id="s578">The River was Vilier.</span> <span id="s579">The Vilno forests and the Vil...and the Vilno...uh...Mountains.</span> <span id="s580">And we are...we are dreaming about you and we are thinking about you and we cannot forget the old times.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">And as we were walking, we...kept the very tight and we actually didn't know where we walked.</span> <span id="s582">And then after walking for a long time, we came to that Cemetery.</span> <span id="s583">The first thing that we saw when we came to the Cemetery, by the gate there were three young bodies hanging.</span> <span id="s584">There was a young girl and two boys.</span> <span id="s585">We found out there were members of the Vilno Resistance that would hang there.</span> <span id="s586">It was a windy day and the body was just...just going back and forth in the wind.</span> <span id="s587">It was such a eerie, eerie feeling and I..</span> <span id="s588">.</span> <span id="s589">I..</span> <span id="s590">I could smell the death.</span> <span id="s591">I could smell...I..</span> <span id="s592">.</span> <span id="s593">I could smell all them...the sorrow of the world.</span> <span id="s594">And we were...the...the col..</span> <span id="s595">.</span> <span id="s596">after the passage, the columns stopped and they were just a column of women and we heard rumors that there will be a selection.</span> <span id="s597">And the selection to the right to live, and selection to the left to die.</span> <span id="s598">To the right, just young able bodies; and to the left are women with children, sick people and old people.</span> <span id="s599">My Aunt Sonia was only in her early 40s, but she looked very old and my little sister was then just 11 years old, but she looked much, much young, so my Aunt took off her shoes from...that had a little heel and she put them on my sister.</span> <span id="s600">She should look a little bit...uh...taller, and she kind of took her brow and put it in...she should look, she should look grownup.</span> <span id="s601">And I..</span> <span id="s602">.</span> <span id="s603">I saw people there wondering around in a daze.</span> <span id="s604">It...it was...there was a child there crying and one of their sisters was holding her by the hand and he says he was looking for his mother.</span> <span id="s605">There were women just tearing their hair out, sitting right there.</span> <span id="s606">And the column started to move.</span> <span id="s607">Then it came to a stop.</span> <span id="s608">And we saw SS men dressed in the...in the black uniforms, with that hat.</span> <span id="s609">They had the special hat with the...with the insig...insignia.</span> <span id="s610">The insignia was like...uh...a school, a..</span> <span id="s611">.</span> <span id="s612">a cross, with those red swastikas, with those big barking dogs.</span> <span id="s613">Those dogs were barking so loud and they were such a big police dogs.</span> <span id="s614">I..</span> <span id="s615">.</span> <span id="s616">I see them before me.</span> <span id="s617">They are like grey and black, and they are alarming and they were...and the...the Germans, the Gestapo, they were armed.</span> <span id="s618">They were armed with real rifles.</span> <span id="s619">And then the selection begun.</span> <span id="s620">They were...they were just pushing people left and right.</span> <span id="s621">And all of sudden...I don't know how it happened...I find myself, my sister on the right, and my aunt was not with us.</span> <span id="s622">So I ran back to the assistant and I spoke with this SS man very good German.</span> <span id="s623">I started to plead with him.</span> <span id="s624">I want to go to my mother.</span> <span id="s625">So he took out the other side of the carbine, you know, of the rifle and he beat on me and he pushed me away to the right.</span> <span id="s626">I fell on the floor and he was yelling, "You go and you have to work for the fatherland."</span> <span id="s627">I was devastated.</span> <span id="s628">I..</span> <span id="s629">.</span> <span id="s630">I did...I couldn't imagine that we were separated from my aunt.</span> <span id="s631">And all of a sudden I found my other aunt...my other Aunt Esther that was my mother's sister.</span> <span id="s632">She some...she was even eld...older...uh...older than my aunt, but somehow they...she went through and she was there, right there...with my cousin.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Her name was Lena.</span> <span id="s634">And also with her daughter-in-law.</span> <span id="s635">Her name was Malisha.</span> <span id="s636">She was from Lodz.</span> <span id="s637">And she embraced me and she took me in and they started to calm me down.</span> <span id="s638">I..</span> <span id="s639">.</span> <span id="s640">I was really hysterical, beside myself, and somehow very soon after this, they ...they started to load us into the cattle trains.</span> <span id="s641">And on this...those cattle trains were we...when we were loaded we were pushed...we didn't even have a place where to sit down.</span> <span id="s642">There were a very big vat, you know, beer... with water and some disinfectant in the center.</span> <span id="s643">And we just had to stay around there because we couldn't even squat.</span> <span id="s644">The...this.</span> <span id="s645">.</span> <span id="s646">in the center was supposed toilet, but the...we didn't have water.</span> <span id="s647">We didn't have bread.</span> <span id="s648">We didn't have anything.</span> <span id="s649">And I really I was so desperate and so beside myself I don't recall now how long were we...we traveled.</span> <span id="s650">But all of a sudden, we heard the wagons stopped.</span> <span id="s651">The whole time they didn't let us out.</span> <span id="s652">We...we stopped and we were some kind of a railroad station.</span> <span id="s653">It was dark at night.</span> <span id="s654">It was full of SS men, the same dress, the same dogs, and there were all kinds of guards.</span> <span id="s655">And they were very...a lot of lights, reflectors.</span> <span id="s656">You know what is a reflector?</span> <span id="s657">That was just shining at us and we were pushed and we told to unload.</span> <span id="s658">And I realized with my sister and my cousin that we were in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s659">And it was the Kalstra concentration camp near Riga.</span> <span id="s660">And I don't know if it was imagination, but I smelled some burning.</span> <span id="s661">And in my imagination we were...I mean not my imagination...my mind, I felt that we are taking to the crematoria.</span> <span id="s662">I don't know from where, women guards appeared.</span> <span id="s663">This woman guards were really something.</span> <span id="s664">They were very strong women, blonde, barrel chested and with long boots and all of them had to...what you had to the horses, how you call it?</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: Whips.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: Whips.</span> <span id="s667">All of them were whips.</span> <span id="s668">And they told us right away to line up and to get undressed.</span> <span id="s669">Naked!</span> <span id="s670">You know, one, you are only a person as soon...as long as you have your clothes on.</span> <span id="s671">You can be a professor.</span> <span id="s672">You can be a doctor.</span> <span id="s673">You can be a scientist.</span> <span id="s674">You can be a shoemaker.</span> <span id="s675">But as long...as soon as your clothes come up and you stand naked, you are lost.</span> <span id="s676">You are not a humanbeing anymore.</span> <span id="s677">This is what I cannot...what I cannot forgive the Germans that they...they took off our...systematically take...took away our dignity.</span> <span id="s678">But undressing us, many of the girls were young girls.</span> <span id="s679">They were virgins.</span> <span id="s680">They never saw their parents naked, never saw their mothers naked, but all of a sudden we...we have to go and get undressed.</span> <span id="s681">We were taken to...to the...to someplace.</span> <span id="s682">They said that they are taking out us to bath, to a general bath, a general bath.</span> <span id="s683">I remember holding my little sister by the hand and we were sharing a shower and I was saying goodbye to her because I was sure that the gas will come out any moment.</span> <span id="s684">And I..</span> <span id="s685">.</span> <span id="s686">it was talking to her to sooth her out because she was very afraid, and I was telling her, "Don't worry.</span> <span id="s687">Mama...Mama is looking for us from Heaven."</span> <span id="s688">And we were standing there.</span> <span id="s689">I was just like saying goodbye and then all of sudden, the water appeared.</span> <span id="s690">And then we realized that we are not in the crematorium, but we are just...they are rooms where we washed.</span> <span id="s691">And then you know who went to a series examination with the doctors.</span> <span id="s692">The doctors were so brutal.</span> <span id="s693">They were so...they were...they were so sadistic, and half were...and undressed and all the...we found ourselves outside that we had to line up.</span> <span id="s694">Line up again and there were all kinds of big piles of...of clothing and big pile of shoe and big...so we had to go and choose our dresses or our shoes and...and they told us to get dressed and we were taken to barracks.</span> <span id="s695">I was in a way lucky because I didn't think I'll survive too long.</span> <span id="s696">There were some of my friends were taken to work in...they called it the .</span> <span id="s697">This is where they were sorting out the...the dresses I think, but I was taken to dinner worker.</span> <span id="s698">A German came, a few German and they were selecting women and me and my sister were selected.</span> <span id="s699">And they take...took us to the labor camp.</span> <span id="s700">It was Dinnerwork.</span> <span id="s701">We were unloaded.</span> <span id="s702">I think it was on trucks.</span> <span id="s703">And we were taking to Dinnerwork.</span> <span id="s704">Dinnerwork, it was a labor camp ran by the Toad organization.</span> <span id="s705">This was a construction organization and all the guards there were middle aged Germans that were not taken to the Russian, were not taken to the army.</span> <span id="s706">In Dinnerwork, there was a big mixture all kind of people that were worked there as slaves.</span> <span id="s707">This was slave...slave labor.</span> <span id="s708">We met...uh...POWs from Holland that were very nice.</span> <span id="s709">They were young boys that helped us a lot.</span> <span id="s710">And we were taken to some barracks and as strange as it will sound to you, after the ghetto and in car survived, we found ourselves quite comfortable in Dinnerworker because first of all, we had water.</span> <span id="s711">Each of us had a bed to sleep, and we also...the...the Russians were much, much better and we kind of straighten out ourselves because all...from the young girls became little old women.</span> <span id="s712">In the...in Dinnerworker I was in room number 4.</span> <span id="s713">There were maybe 40, 50 women in one room.</span> <span id="s714">And they were....and we were separated by a very heavy door from the men.</span> <span id="s715">The commandant from the...from the whole camp was a German ober...we called him oberstrumfuhrer.</span> <span id="s716">And he was...he was a married German.</span> <span id="s717">Very tall, and with children, very tall and cute.</span> <span id="s718">I remember him walking with...with tall...tall boots and we were lucky.</span> <span id="s719">He became very friendly with one of the German...with our inmate, a Jewish girl.</span> <span id="s720">She was a Jewish girl from Berlin, and she was a cabaret singer.</span> <span id="s721">She was a real beauty.</span> <span id="s722">You couldn't find where her legs start and finish.</span> <span id="s723">She was all legs.</span> <span id="s724">She spoke half and half German.</span> <span id="s725">And he fell in love with her.</span> <span id="s726">He took her out from the room.</span> <span id="s727">She was in my room, and he gave her a separate room and he gave her special clothes.</span> <span id="s728">She...she was wearing high boots and like the...the uniforms...the coats when you wear when you ride, a riding habit.</span> <span id="s729">And she kind of...kind of had a very good influence on him.</span> <span id="s730">He was playing with fire because if a German was not supposed to socialize with a Jewish girl, but this was a closed compound and he was in charge...in charge there, and he adjusted his life for it.</span> <span id="s731">But if there was any time any problems, we could always support her and she was trying to sooth it.</span> <span id="s732">And she was excellent...excellent barrier for us, between us and him.</span> <span id="s733">He became much more mellow.</span> <span id="s734">It wasn't...it was not a paradise.</span> <span id="s735">Every morning at dawn, it was still dark, it was bells so we had to get up and we had to...we had to line up.</span> <span id="s736">It was called the appell, in German the appell.</span> <span id="s737">I didn't mention that every day that we were in Kalsea, we had to go to the appell also.</span> <span id="s738">And every day we were counted.</span> <span id="s739">There was no possibility for us to escape, but every day we were counted like sheep.</span> <span id="s740">Anyhow, there was...uh...uh...we... we...we would get up in the morning and we would work.</span> <span id="s741">We worked very hard in Dinnerworker.</span> <span id="s742">We were working on constructions and we were...we were pushing very, very heavy wagons with sand.</span> <span id="s743">We were...uh...passing....we had to line up and work with...uh...those...how you call those...but you build...uh...build a house...uh...I'm a little nervous.</span> <span id="s744">I forgot.</span> <span id="s745">You know how you call it?</span></p> <p><span id="s746">When you build a house, the pieces, how you call it?</span> <span id="s747">Uh...Anyhow, we worked with constructions and when...by the end of the day we were exhausted.</span> <span id="s748">But the truth, by the end of the day when we came we had to place there to ourselves.</span> <span id="s749">And we...we...we had a place where to sleep.</span> <span id="s750">We had a special, distinct clothing.</span> <span id="s751">We had pants and a jacket and on...on the front and on the back of the clothing, there were white, wide rings and on the sides of the pants, there were white...white stripes.</span> <span id="s752">So it was a precaution we shouldn't escape, because there were some workers that used to come, used to come there and they used to go out.</span> <span id="s753">And my sister was told to...to work for the Gestapo commander...uh... that was in charge of the gate and she had to go there every morning and clean his house and also do his laundry.</span> <span id="s754">And after a..</span> <span id="s755">.</span> <span id="s756">a..</span> <span id="s757">.</span> <span id="s758">awhile, she got very sick.</span> <span id="s759">She developed rheumatism, but it was a very special rheumatism that affects your heart, and.</span> <span id="s760">.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Q: Rheumatic fever?</span></p> <p><span id="s762">A: Rheumatic fever.</span> <span id="s763">And she was...and she was kept in...in a small place.</span> <span id="s764">It was a..</span> <span id="s765">.</span> <span id="s766">like if you had a coat or whatever, you could stay there a day or two.</span> <span id="s767">But if you stayed 3 days, you were taken out and this was goodbye.</span> <span id="s768">Shot!</span> <span id="s769">When she was taken there in charge of this...this was called in Germany Revere.</span> <span id="s770">This...you know, it was a German doctor that had a daughter the same age and she looked like my sister.</span> <span id="s771">The German doctor kind of felt sorry for her, and he used to steal medicine from the SS man.</span> <span id="s772">He used to give her the medicine and he let her stay there.</span> <span id="s773">She was for there may 3, 4 weeks, which was very...was just unusual.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">This is just a human interest story that I am telling you.</span> <span id="s775">And he was just taking care of her.</span> <span id="s776">And he...he told her that she reminded him of his little daughter.</span> <span id="s777">Now, there was...there was a cultural life in Dinnerwork.</span> <span id="s778">A very good friend of mine that working as...as a shoemaker from all the things they were told.</span> <span id="s779">He was a shoemaker and was fixing German boots.</span> <span id="s780">At night, he used to write poetry, and she used to...we used to recite the poetry.</span> <span id="s781">And even she wrote a song.</span> <span id="s782">The song...the song is called Dinnerworker.</span> <span id="s783">Do you want me to...to sing it?</span></p> <p><span id="s784">The words are...are by...by my friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: What is her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: Her...her name was Tosha.</span> <span id="s787">She didn't survive.</span> <span id="s788">She was just a little girl, but she was a real, real poet.</span> <span id="s789">For her to write a poem was just nothing.</span> <span id="s790">It was just bubbling out of her.</span> <span id="s791">She would...wherever she was, she was going with scraps of paper and she was...she was just writing.</span> <span id="s792">She was from Lodz, and she and her parents and sister escaped in 19...in 1940 from Lodz and they escaped.</span> <span id="s793">There were a lot of people...Polish Jews that escaped from Vilno...to Vilno.</span> <span id="s794">Some the Germans.</span> <span id="s795">We called them the , because they were running away from the Germans and because the German came up and to us 3 years later in 41, a lot of them started a new life in Vilno.</span> <span id="s796">When, unfortunately, when the ghetto was organized, she...she came to the ghetto and she was together with us.</span> <span id="s797">And the...the melody is from a Russian song.</span> <span id="s798">And this is...this is a really...this is a really beautiful song that tells a lot about the conditions in Dinnerworker.</span> <span id="s799">But goes on and on, but I wanta just tell you, it tells...uh...it tells us that in Dinnerworker, were an island surrounded by waters and forests and there are Jews from all the world that work very hard and are constantly freezing in the cold weather.</span> <span id="s800">In the morning, it is still dark, but the bell rings and we have to go out, stand up and go to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">And we are asking the world why are the Jews punished?</span> <span id="s802">For...for what things?</span> <span id="s803">For whose things are Jews being punished?</span> <span id="s804">We used to....we used to sing this all the song that goes on and on, and there were...there is also another poem about the dress...the dress that we wear...wear, we were wearing.</span> <span id="s805">In each and every poem, there is also a poem that describes...this is called advertising and it describes how the young girls work very hard to earn their meager portion of...of the bread and water that they are getting.</span> <span id="s806">And they are...the only thing that they hope that one day will come that they will walk with themselves in their own land.</span> <span id="s807">So they are very poignant and very...very sad, revealing poems.</span> <span id="s808">Also there is a poem called The Spring, where a young girls were sitting and waiting for the Spring to come.</span> <span id="s809">Spring is such a nice...nice month, but not for us because our freedom is taken away.</span> <span id="s810">We don't lose our hope that one day we will be free, but in the meantime, we feel that the whole world around us forgot us.</span> <span id="s811">I just wanted...to people to know that those people, those girls, those young women that were there were living and breathing one thing.</span> <span id="s812">Freedom and survival.</span> <span id="s813">Their spirit was so strong.</span> <span id="s814">Their bodies were very weak.</span> <span id="s815">But there was something in them that just didn't let them die.</span> <span id="s816">I have to tell you now about something that happened in Dinnerworker which is really remarkable.</span> <span id="s817">We had guards all over.</span> <span id="s818">One of the guards was a younger German, and each and every room had...had a Jewish woman that was in charge.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">And in one of the rooms...this was room number 3....was...in charge was a Mrs. Schwartz.</span> <span id="s820">She was little older than us because she was married at this time already.</span> <span id="s821">She was not a beauty, but a very clever woman.</span> <span id="s822">And somehow, I don't know how, this young German guard fell in love.</span> <span id="s823">And every night, they used to talk for hours and hours.</span> <span id="s824">And we couldn't understand this what he saw in her, but this was...and he used to bring her special food.</span> <span id="s825">She was very good.</span> <span id="s826">She used to share it with other girls.</span> <span id="s827">Yes.</span> <span id="s828">And one day came and there were trucks standing in front of our...the building that we were kept, and they said they...they need women to...uh...labor camp.</span> <span id="s829">It was called , and they working something with electric...electricity...electric lamps, something.</span> <span id="s830">And between those that were taken was also Mrs. Schwartz.</span> <span id="s831">Mrs..</span> <span id="s832">.</span> <span id="s833">of course, this guard was beside himself, and he went right with there, with her.</span> <span id="s834">Not officially, but he went as a guard with them.</span> <span id="s835">When...we were told.</span> <span id="s836">I wasn't...I didn't see it, but I was told that when they came there, there was a selection and since Mrs.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Schwartz was a little older, she was taken in a truck and this man...this guard knew that she was taken to be shot.</span> <span id="s838">When he saw her being taken away, he shot himself.</span> <span id="s839">So this was one the remarkable story.</span> <span id="s840">We stayed in Dinnerworker til one day...one day I think it was already in 1944, they told...they all loaded us into a big boat, and they took us across the Baltic Sea.</span> <span id="s841">It was near Danzig, in East Russia, and when we came to a place, this was some kind of a port.</span> <span id="s842">After a voyage of 3 or 4 days on the big boat, on the big...uh.</span> <span id="s843">.</span> <span id="s844">boat, we were taken with barrages to a different concentration camp.</span> <span id="s845">The concentration camp was Tutorial.</span> <span id="s846">It was in 1944.</span> <span id="s847">When we were...to describe Stutthof, it take...it can take a week.</span> <span id="s848">I tried to be very...if...if there is a misery there was Stutt...there was Stuffhof.</span> <span id="s849">The barracks were terrible.</span> <span id="s850">The food in the morning they used to give us a slice of black bread and a little bit hot water, black.</span> <span id="s851">Since we didn't have water to wash our head, we used this...this water to wash our hair.</span> <span id="s852">Uh...During they day they used...they used to bring a very big pot, tremendous pot like the pot sometimes you used the pet.</span> <span id="s853">You used the pet and to wash to do their wash them in the...and it was full with black water, many times cold with turnips half cooked.</span> <span id="s854">And they...this was our...this was what they will give us to eat, and after they finished the...the women guards would finish to distribute this meager rations.</span> <span id="s855">Since we were so hungry, we used to crawl with the head to...to scrap some food on the bottom, and the German used to stand and laugh.</span> <span id="s856">We were surrounded with...uh...electric wire and with so many men and women just fall on the electric wires.</span> <span id="s857">I saw it.</span> <span id="s858">They committed suicide.</span> <span id="s859">Men they separated from you.</span> <span id="s860">We saw there Hungarian women.</span> <span id="s861">We saw there that were brought because it was already 44, we saw the...we saw the...we saw all kinds of nationalities...Jewish nationalities.</span> <span id="s862">And those German guards were so bad, so sadistic, so cruel that I just don't have the words to describe.</span> <span id="s863">One day they called us out...they put us...it was cold...in appell.</span> <span id="s864">We had to stand up, and they said that young women will be taken to a labor camp.</span> <span id="s865">My sister then was...was in big danger, and when she passed near the German, he asked her...I told her to stand with herself out and show that she had a big bust, and I put some...something into her breast.</span> <span id="s866">And "How old you are?"</span> <span id="s867">And she said, "I am 18."</span> <span id="s868">Uh...He...he...she went through, but it was such a traumatic experience for me that I cannot...because my mind already said goodbye to her.</span> <span id="s869">And also the first time in Stutthof, I saw those stripes because those striped uniform and we very anxious to get them because we were very cold.</span> <span id="s870">We didn't...we had very thin dresses.</span> <span id="s871">We didn't have shoes.</span> <span id="s872">My legs were frostbitten, and those uniforms were kind...but they...they didn't give us at this time.</span> <span id="s873">And really at the strangest sound they would help us to fight the cold.</span> <span id="s874">Very shortly, after we left Stutthof, a big epidemic of typhus broke out there.</span> <span id="s875">My aunt and my cousin died right there in the epidemic.</span> <span id="s876">My cousin-in-law survived this...this epidemic, and I met her after the libera...liberation, but just the moment when I was separated from my aunt from there, it was a..</span> <span id="s877">.</span> <span id="s878">took so much of the spirits because they...my...my...they didn't want to go because my aunt...then she was in her 40s looked older.</span> <span id="s879">They knew that she will not accept it, and she didn't go.</span> <span id="s880">Finally, we were brought to Stuttgart labor camp.</span> <span id="s881">Oh, it was...Stutthof labor camp was a camp...a camp that we really worked very, very hard because facilities were miserable.</span> <span id="s882">We didn't have the proper clothing.</span> <span id="s883">We were really freezing, and we worked very hard.</span> <span id="s884">We were working in the forest.</span> <span id="s885">And we also were building trenches.</span> <span id="s886">And every day, every day there were girls just dying.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">They were falling like flies.</span> <span id="s888">Any...any little infraction, they were beaten.</span> <span id="s889">They get like 20 lashes, 25 lashes and...on their behind, and since they were so malnourished, those slashes just were full of pus.</span> <span id="s890">They never healed and those girls never, never recovered.</span> <span id="s891">We was at a place called Revere.</span> <span id="s892">And it...and a Hungarian woman doctor was in charge with there.</span> <span id="s893">She was helping whatever she could, but there was so little that she could do.</span> <span id="s894">Every day when we came from work, I was going to her and I developed very big...very big sores on my legs, very bad circulation, and she would help me.</span> <span id="s895">Because if they would...the German would see myself, they will shot me.</span> <span id="s896">And I was...I am soever grateful with her, and by coincidence, I met her after the liberation and she was very instrumental to my survival.</span> <span id="s897">I will tell you about this later.</span> <span id="s898">After we'd stayed in.</span> <span id="s899">.</span> <span id="s900">in Stuttgart a long time, one day was the day that I will never forget it.</span> <span id="s901">It was a day before the Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s902">I was not from a relig...religious family, and I am not...was really not observant, but there were a lot of women that were very observant.</span> <span id="s903">And they kind of knew when...I don't know how because we had no...no papers, no picture.</span> <span id="s904">We had nothing.</span> <span id="s905">No identification.</span> <span id="s906">And right there next...next bed to us was a woman that was...was an aunt of a friend of mine, and she was a patient of my mother.</span> <span id="s907">She was from...she was one of those people that my mother helped, that she was not of the wealthy ones.</span> <span id="s908">And she...when she saw us in Stuttgart, in the labor camp, she kind of took care of us because she was very lucky.</span> <span id="s909">She worked...worked in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s910">And whatever scraps she was bring...she was bring at night.</span> <span id="s911">She would be shot if they would find her because if a girl went out from the line and she picked up a frozen turnip, that was...that was sent to .</span> <span id="s912">She was shot right there.</span> <span id="s913">But she shot and my friend as we were walking in the dark because it was in end of September.</span> <span id="s914">It was already very dark in the morning, maybe 4, 5 o'clock in the morning, she told us...my aunt told me that you are invited.</span> <span id="s915">You will fast tomorrow, and tonight you are invited.</span> <span id="s916">She's preparing a little celebration, something to eat.</span> <span id="s917">So we were very...we were very excited because you know what this food, a piece of bread, black bread, this... And as we working, a rumor spread...the women that were religious, told our guard that they would like to finish work a little earlier because tomorrow is the day of atonement.</span> <span id="s918">It's a very big day.</span> <span id="s919">And do you know that the guards kept us this night longer than usual.</span> <span id="s920">They were harsher to us.</span> <span id="s921">They gave us more lashes and when we came home we were so tired that we couldn't even eat.</span> <span id="s922">We were just over exhausted.</span> <span id="s923">We were just happy that you could lie down and stretch out.</span> <span id="s924">I didn't go to the .</span> <span id="s925">I didn't do nothing.</span> <span id="s926">The next day in Kippur, we went to work with nothing.</span> <span id="s927">I was just telling you how people treated people, and I don't want this to be forgotten, what the humanbeing can do to a humanbeing.</span> <span id="s928">Very soon after this, a rumor started to spread that the Germans are in retreat, and a very big thing developed right there in Stuttgard between those guards.</span> <span id="s929">Those guards were real SS men with those black things.</span> <span id="s930">And they took us out and they took...and they took us on...I..</span> <span id="s931">.</span> <span id="s932">we call it the death march.</span> <span id="s933">They were taking us one side to another and sometimes, we were taken from one direction and we saw other people, prisoners, concentration camp, Polish people, Jews, taken from the other side.</span> <span id="s934">At...we used to walk endless, endless times, and we didn't have shoes.</span> <span id="s935">We...we matter of fact had those wooden shoes that...that really were...were...you couldn't walk on the snow with it, because the snow was just going there and you used to walk like a circus performer, and used to form.</span> <span id="s936">And at night, they used to put us in a big barn without food.</span> <span id="s937">They used to occupy a big barn of a Polish peasant, a German peasant.</span> <span id="s938">It does...wasn't a act in East Prussia.</span> <span id="s939">In the morning we had to...to straighten ourselves, put ourselves in a column.</span> <span id="s940">They will count us.</span> <span id="s941">And we will go forwards.</span> <span id="s942">And one day when we came to a..</span> <span id="s943">.</span> <span id="s944">to a place, one of these guards got bezerk.</span> <span id="s945">He put us straight in a column and he just started to shoot discriminately.</span> <span id="s946">A woman that was standing near me...she was standing here; I was standing here.</span> <span id="s947">My sister was shot.</span> <span id="s948">I lost my sister.</span> <span id="s949">And I didn't know what happened.</span> <span id="s950">After they...he...he was subdued, there were a lot of bodies just lying around, and I was besides myself looking for my sister, and after awhile, we found ourselves.</span> <span id="s951">She...she escaped, and I..</span> <span id="s952">.</span> <span id="s953">she was running and I was running, and we found ourselves and we started to smell death.</span> <span id="s954">We were really smelled death.</span> <span id="s955">And this march...they called the death march, was something undescribable because we were walking and sleeping.</span> <span id="s956">The last night we walked the whole day and the whole night and we closed our eyes and we were sleeping.</span> <span id="s957">The night before we were put in a big barrack, and I practically gave up.</span> <span id="s958">Because I was so exhausted and was so tired that I told my sister that...there was a lot of hay.</span> <span id="s959">We were sitting in the hay, that we were go into the hay and wait...and wait for them that the Germans should come, they should walk away, and we will just die very peaceful lying in the hay.</span> <span id="s960">But when they came out and they counted, they realized that a few women were missing, so the Polish peasant came with a German and he looked in the barn, and they were poking and as they poked...they poked and they found us.</span> <span id="s961">And I was begging the German guard, the SS man, to shot me because I couldn't go.</span> <span id="s962">And he pushed me and he says to me, "You are too young to die and...and straighten yourself out," and pushed me to the column.</span> <span id="s963">This...this...I was there.</span> <span id="s964">And I am telling you and this...this I memory stick out, written in my soul even after so many years.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">We started to walk, and we were a group of young girls that were very close.</span> <span id="s966">.</span> <span id="s967">close together.</span> <span id="s968">We...we actually supported ourselves.</span> <span id="s969">The girl that wrote the poem and my little friend, the girl that her mother...her aunt was the cook, we kind...we...we had like a kind of coalition, and we knew the only way we can survive if we will stay in the front.</span> <span id="s970">Because if you were staying in the back and you couldn't walk with the column, you were just shot.</span> <span id="s971">And then I saw young girls walk and walk and all of a sudden they became like frozen.</span> <span id="s972">Straighten their legs, and sit and they were just like frozen monuments, falling right with their face on the snow.</span> <span id="s973">The German didn't have to shot them.</span> <span id="s974">This is how they fell.</span> <span id="s975">One of my friends started to feel bad, and we took her and I was from one side and another of my friend and we were dragging her, practically dragging her.</span> <span id="s976">She couldn't help.</span> <span id="s977">Legs were frozen.</span> <span id="s978">So the guard noticed it.</span> <span id="s979">He...he...he told the column to stop.</span> <span id="s980">He took her to a certain field, and we heard the shot.</span> <span id="s981">He shot her right there.</span> <span id="s982">(Crying) And then he send out another girl.</span> <span id="s983">She should take off...she had a little coat...a little warm coat on her which was very unusual.</span> <span id="s984">She should take it off and take it to herself.</span> <span id="s985">So this girl, she didn't know her, but the will was survival was so strong, she took it...her off, and she put it and she couldn't stand it.</span> <span id="s986">But she didn't know.</span> <span id="s987">She wanted to survive.</span> <span id="s988">What can you do?</span> <span id="s989">Many times in the night when I..</span> <span id="s990">.</span> <span id="s991">I get up...I wake myself up screaming and I see those young girls, frozen, falling on the snow.</span> <span id="s992">This is something undescribable.</span> <span id="s993">The...here on the cheeks, they were red, and they were just sticks.</span> <span id="s994">This is something that whoever wasn't there cannot believe it.</span> <span id="s995">And when I talk to you I think I'm telling you something that happened to somebody else because I cannot believe that I went through it and then lived to tell.</span> <span id="s996">It was March 11, 1945.</span> <span id="s997">We came to a place called Kruma.</span> <span id="s998">It was East Prussia.</span> <span id="s999">It was a small town.</span> <span id="s1000">As we walked in there, there was a tremendous barn.</span> <span id="s1001">I never saw anything like it, and all of us were put into this barn.</span> <span id="s1002">In this barn, we met people from all the nationalities.</span> <span id="s1003">There were men also.</span> <span id="s1004">And...and the barn was surrounded by Gestapo, and as we were looking through the doors and actually the doors were a little open...there were no windows, we saw the Gestapo putting out little...twigs, around the barn.</span> <span id="s1005">They wanted to burn.</span> <span id="s1006">It was decided that they didn't know what to do with us anymore, and they wanted to hold up...there were thousands of people there.</span> <span id="s1007">All kinds of languages that spoke...spoken.</span> <span id="s1008">And we were just sitting there, and all of a sudden, it was in the morning, March 11, 1945, that we heard a big commotion, and somebody started to scream, "The Russian are coming."</span> <span id="s1009">And we didn't find one German.</span> <span id="s1010">I don't know.</span> <span id="s1011">They disappeared.</span> <span id="s1012">The German guard disappeared.</span> <span id="s1013">I was afraid to run out.</span> <span id="s1014">I was sitting.</span> <span id="s1015">And then...my friends started to scream and yell, "The Russians are coming."</span> <span id="s1016">And we saw the Russian soldiers.</span> <span id="s1017">They occupied the city...this little town, and one of the Russian soldiers took a rifle and shot a..</span> <span id="s1018">.</span> <span id="s1019">a German guard, took off his shoes and gave me his boots because the Germans had said if they were very well dressed, and without hesitation.</span> <span id="s1020">I didn't think twice.</span> <span id="s1021">I took this...otherwise, I would never survive because I didn't have shoes to walk.</span> <span id="s1022">You know...we arrived in this little town, there was a dairy factory and they were making there cheese and cream and people were very hungry.</span> <span id="s1023">They used...they ran to the factory, and they were drinking the...the cream and the right there they were vomiting because the stomach...and...and typhoid epidemic started to spread.</span> <span id="s1024">I was infected with typhus then already.</span> <span id="s1025">I didn't know about it.</span> <span id="s1026">And there was...there was a very big house.</span> <span id="s1027">It was like a castle.</span> <span id="s1028">It belonged to some kind of a Nazi, and the Russian to...to go there and to just to find a place.</span> <span id="s1029">They didn't know what to do with us.</span> <span id="s1030">So we were lying there on the floor, and people were dying like flies.</span> <span id="s1031">You...you could see...you could just step over dead bodies.</span> <span id="s1032">And in this big commotion,...oh, I met this Hungarian doctor that I was telling you about.</span> <span id="s1033">This Hungarian doctor that was in Stutthof, , survived.</span> <span id="s1034">And she...she put...she was...she put herself a Red Cross then, and she was collecting those few girls that she knew and I was...my sister was there, and I had a few friends and she said that there is a very good danger because the Russian soldiers are raping the Jewish girls.</span> <span id="s1035">And she said we have to take a horse and buggy and I have to take you.</span> <span id="s1036">I heard that if...I don't know how many miles...10 miles, 20 miles from here, there is a Russian hospital and they will accept you there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">Q: We have one minute.</span> <span id="s1038">Can you tell us just very briefly where you were taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">A: We were...on our...we were traveling with this...with this buggy, and the Russian...the Russian took us on our horse, so we were actually walking and we stopped in a house.</span> <span id="s1040">The house...I don't know how many miles it was, but it was close...but it was close to the hospital, and we just couldn't walk anymore.</span> <span id="s1041">So I spoke a very good Russian, and we went into this house and I asked the Russian soldiers if we could sleep over.</span> <span id="s1042">They said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s1043">They gave us permission to sleep, but in the middle of the night, they came to this house and it was a big tragedy.</span> <span id="s1044">A few girls were raped right there.</span> <span id="s1045">I..</span> <span id="s1046">.</span> <span id="s1047">I escaped with my sister because a soldier came to my bed, and I was separated.</span> <span id="s1048">And I started to scream and yell in Russian.</span> <span id="s1049">And I was begging in his mother's name he shouldn't touch me and my sister I put under the bed.</span> <span id="s1050">So he didn't know, but I was.</span> <span id="s1051">And the doctor ran out and...and she ran up, and she ran to the officer that was in charge and brought him over to my bed and I explained to him that we all infected with typhus and we would spread the typhus to the soldiers, they should leave us alone.</span> <span id="s1052">So the...the officer in charge, there was nothing he could do with those girls that were there already.</span> <span id="s1053">He told the soldiers to come out and he put a guard and this left overnight.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">And next morning, we were taken to the Russian hospital where I stood and there I was 9th of May.</span> <span id="s1055">9th of May 45, when it was end of the war, I was there.</span> <span id="s1056">I was sick a whole year.</span> <span id="s1057">And in the Russian hospital, I was 99 percent near dead because I had typhoid, I had , and I developed T.B.</span> <span id="s1058">The misery that I saw there between the Jewish girl...some that were infected with the.....</span></p></body></html>
