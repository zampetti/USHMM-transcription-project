id="s17">A: Oh, my name now?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: Your name now.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: Roberta Stubblefield (ph) Jones.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: And what is your date of birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: October 15, 1921.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: And where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: St. Louis, Missouri.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: And you lived in St. Louis for how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: I --just a few months.</span> <span id="s26">About six, I think, then we moved to Pocahontas, Arkansas.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: And did you live in Pocahontas for awhile?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s29">For awhile.</span> <span id="s30">Then we moved to Oklahoma for awhile, then we came back to Pocahontas until I graduated from high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: And could you talk about your growing up and your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s33">I grew up in a--probably a lower-- incomewise, lower middle class, and during the Depression, then we were quite poor because of--because of the Depression, and--</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: What did your father do?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: My father did a little farming.</span> <span id="s36">He had a grocery store, and that--I'll have to think about this just a minute here.</span> <span id="s37">He had a little grocery store a time or two, did some farming, and then for awhile he worked for the WPA, if you know what that was.</span> <span id="s38">Works Progress Administration.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: It was a government agency?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s41">One that Franklin Roosevelt established, which I think a lot of people in the North thought it was a very bad thing to have, but the southern people thought it was a lifesaver.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: So that helped your family--</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: --and he was able to work for them?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s46">It was--saved their pride.</span> <span id="s47">That meant that they could get the jobs and work for the money and--</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: Did you understand as a child what was happening, that Roosevelt had set this up and that enabled your father to have a job?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: Oh, absolutely.</span> <span id="s50">Absolutely.</span> <span id="s51">And --because my father lost just about everything in the --in the Depression.</span> <span id="s52">Prior to that things were--were good, good enough.</span> <span id="s53">And then--when we moved back from Oklahoma to Arkansas, we were there about--there a few months, and someone set fire to our house, and they put it out after--we weren't there, we were visiting my grandmother, so they--and they extinguished--extinguished the fire after it had gutted one room, so then my father had that rebuilt.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: How old were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: At--at this point I was nine or ten.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: And--</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: Probably nine.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: And do you remember how you reacted to the fire?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: To that one, not --not really, but just a few months later we were back visiting my grandmother again, and someone set it on fire again, and it burned to the ground, and we had nothing except what we had worn to my grandmother's for the weekend.</span> <span id="s60">That I remember 'cause I remember coming back and looking down into the base--in the basement --down into the ground which had been the basement and seeing my little wagon and--and it just hurt 'cause all the toys were des--destroyed.</span> <span id="s61">Everything.</span> <span id="s62">Clothing, the whole bit.</span> <span id="s63">And we never found out who did it or why but felt that the people who had lived in our house when we were in Oklahoma had made an enemy somewhere because we hadn't been back but just a probably by that time, maybe six months.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: So you think the people set it on fire thinking they were setting someone else's--</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: Thinking--</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: --house--</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: --the house belonged to the people who had rented it from my dad.</span> <span id="s68">So in addition to losing his job, he work--he was a deputy sheriff in the --or something like that in Oklahoma.</span> <span id="s69">In addition to losing that job, having to come back to Arkansas without work, someone burned his house down, and he had—he did have a little farm of 40 acres that we could move out to, but all together it was just blow after blow after blow.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: So as a child you had some tragedy--</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: We did.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: --in life?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: But we had the most loving parents, and two of the most loving sisters you could imagine, and we didn't know we were all that poor.</span> <span id="s74">It was just a--</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: What was your mother like?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: A saint.</span> <span id="s77">Not only would I say that and my sisters say that, but all of our friends thought she was wonderful.</span> <span id="s78">Would love to come to our house because she was just wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: And your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: He was wonderful too, but he was wonderful to our family, to us girls.</span> <span id="s81">You know, we were just everything to him as we were to our mother, and he was --I could say as a father, he was perfect.</span> <span id="s82">He didn't reach out to the community the way my mother did, and my mother reached out to anyone who needed anything.</span> <span id="s83">As poor as we were, she was always giving of her time and whatever she had to everybody else.</span> <span id="s84">My father didn't do that.</span> <span id="s85">His was taking care of his family, and I could understand that 'cause he had to take care of his family so in that respect, it was a great childhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: And you had two sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: Um-hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: And where were you in the birth order?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: I was the youngest.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: So you were the baby?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: Yes, um-hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: And what were your sisters like with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: Wonderful.</span> <span id="s94">Just wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: How much older were they?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: The oldest one was five years older, and the middle, two years older.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: So you were fairly close in age?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: Fairly close and very close.</span> <span id="s99">Still are.</span> <span id="s100">Still very close.</span> <span id="s101">Couldn't do without them.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: And when did you start nursing school?</span> <span id="s103">Was that right after high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: Right after high school.</span> <span id="s105">Probably a matter of six --six months after high school.</span> <span id="s106">Because --oh, that's when there was an opening in --went to Baptist Memorial Hospital in Memphis.</span> <span id="s107">That's when they had their openings for students was six months after I graduated.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: And how did you happen to decide you would go to nursing school?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: Because my mother wanted me to.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: And why did she want you to?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: Her father was a doctor.</span> <span id="s112">My grandfather's a doctor.</span> <span id="s113">She had a brother who was a doctor and a nephew who was a doctor, and to her that was just the ultimate profession.</span> <span id="s114">We didn't have money for any of us to become doctors or--couldn't possibly even consider that, but for a nursing school, yes.</span> <span id="s115">And at that time you had to even buy your --we had to buy our books but, of course, they provided the –actually you worked your way through because you --your room and board was provided, but you had to buy your books.</span> <span id="s116">Nothing was actually given to you and worked--</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: It was hard?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: Very hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: Did--did--you said that your mother wanted you to do it?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: Did you feel strongly that you wanted to, or did you kind of go along?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: I didn't, no, I wanted to--I would have loved something in journalism.</span> <span id="s123">I would have loved journalism, but you just didn't have a lot of choices during the Depression.</span> <span id="s124">You took what you could get and --and I didn't mind.</span> <span id="s125">It wasn't --she didn't force or anything, she just said that would be great.</span> <span id="s126">She loved that so I thought well, might as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: And then after you got into nurse's training, did you like it or think--</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: It was all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: So it was okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s131">I'd rather have been in journalism, but it was okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: And you knew you could get a job.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: Always.</span> <span id="s134">Yes.</span> <span id="s135">That was --oh, that was a tremendous factor at that time 'cause this was 1940.</span> <span id="s136">1940-1944 so still jobs were hard to come by.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: So you finished training in what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: 1944, I think.</span> <span id="s139">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: So that was during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: And then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: At the begin --in January 1944.</span> <span id="s144">Then I --actually I applied to --I wanted to be a flight attendant.</span> <span id="s145">That's not what we called them then.</span> <span id="s146">What'd we call them.</span> <span id="s147">Stewardess.</span> <span id="s148">And stewardesses at that time had to be nurses, so I remember I had a --had an interview set up at the Peabody Hotel in Memphis, and it was a --really looking forward to it, and then people from my hospital started going into the Services, mostly Army, and got very exciting about that time, and I decided that's what I wanted to do, so that's what I did.</span> <span id="s149">Right from nursing school.</span> <span id="s150">No experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: And--</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: I think I was 23.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: --did you have any ideas about where you would be sent as a nurse or...?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: I didn't have any idea, no, but I knew what I wanted.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: What did you want?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: I wanted to go to Europe.</span> <span id="s157">Wanted to go to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: And why did you want to go to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: I--I'm not certain, but I imagine there was a lot of probably excitement and glamor attached to that adventure because remember at that time, I'd just gotten out of nursing school.</span> <span id="s160">Had no idea of what it was all about.</span> <span id="s161">22--or probably 23.</span> <span id="s162">I had no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: What--</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: Never regretted a minute of it, but I had no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: You knew there was some danger.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: Oh, yes, but at that age, it's not --I'm not going to get hurt.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: Nothing would happen to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: Oh, no, huh-uh.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: So you signed up.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: Um-hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: And then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: Went to San Antonio, Texas.</span> <span id="s173">And--oh, so--what did I do.</span> <span id="s174">Signed up--this was all done by mail because then in Arkansas, now, it's all going through--I really don't know where.</span> <span id="s175">So I--I did sign up and received a commission through the mail.</span> <span id="s176">The funniest thing was I didn't know I had a commission.</span> <span id="s177">This is all just very strange to me, and I thought I'd got it when I--I thought I would get it when I reached San Antonio for basic training, but actually I had it the minute that I received the assignment, and it was strange 'cause I was on the train --we all had to stand up on a train.</span> <span id="s178">There were no seats.</span> <span id="s179">The trains were so full and there was a chaplain and a--and an enlisted man and I sharing one seat.</span> <span id="s180">The chaplain got it when he got on.</span> <span id="s181">He was very kind.</span> <span id="s182">And he said we'll all--it was about eight hours from my home to San Antonio.</span> <span id="s183">He said, "We'll share this seat" so we --we actually –have to stand until it's our turn to sit in that one seat and --so as we were talking, they told me --this chaplain and this enlisted man had been in for awhile said, "You're already a second lieutenant."</span> <span id="s184">I thought that was very interesting.</span> <span id="s185">Anyhow --and they thought I was pretty naive so went on down to San Antonio and took basic training there, and I can't remember how much later but not long after that had orders for Camp Swift, Texas, with the 121st Semi-Mobile Evacuation Hospital was --I can't remember the word for that— activating.</span> <span id="s186">Was activating.</span> <span id="s187">So the doctors and nurses and corpsmen from --and administrative people from around the nation and--I think it's probably primarily up here in the --in the East were gathering at San Antonio to activate this tent hospital, and from there we went to New York.</span> <span id="s188">After we were activated as a hospital, all of us were there, we went to New York by train.</span> <span id="s189">Everything's by train in those days, and stayed there a few days, and then at night --well, no, there had to be as much secrecy as possible then because we were going by ship to England, and they still had the U-boats, the Germans had U-boats in the Atlantic, so went by ship to England, and we had no idea where we were going, but I remember going onto the ship and the blackout, complete blackout, and you --suddenly you were on the ship.</span> <span id="s190">It's almost as if you didn't really know you were boarding the ship; but there we were, and I think we left, maybe sailed the next morning and took us five days to get to England, and we were in England and --and that --I believe we were waiting for the --when was D-Day?</span> <span id="s191">Do you remember what day that was?</span> <span id="s192">I think we were waiting for --no, I guess it was the Battle of The Bulge or something.</span> <span id="s193">We were waiting for some real heavy activity to loosen up a little so that we could cross the Channel and go to France.</span> <span id="s194">Stayed there a few days and then we started --and then we went to Luxembourg, and from Luxembourg I know one time another nurse and I and a doctor and a couple of corpsmen were sent to somewhere in Germany.</span> <span id="s195">At that time everything was "somewhere."</span> <span id="s196">No towns could be listed or anything so this was somewhere in Germany which from --and that from Luxembourg is a very, very short distance, and we went in one little old --one little Army ambulance at night.</span> <span id="s197">Of course it had been a blackout, and that was quite a trip because the --in a complete blackout, and they had --I guess--I don't know how they ran that ambulance but must have been very dim lights, so you could see a little bit but not much 'cause anyway they came to a --a huge crater, bomb crater in the road, and the driver had to stop just short of that because he didn't have lights, he couldn't see, but he knew there was something there, and he got out--and he flashed --you had to flash your flashlights down to the ground.</span> <span id="s198">Never up or out but down to the ground, and I remember him flashing that around to see how big the crater was so he could go around it; and down in a ravine by the road we heard these flashes of lights and heard some kind of firing, some kind of skirmishing down there, and we finally reached our destination.</span> <span id="s199">Then the next morning we were really balled out for having come because it was so dangerous, but our commanding officer hadn't known that.</span> <span id="s200">Somehow the communications hadn't been so good so we got to this --where we were detached to this very small outfit, and they needed --they just needed help so badly.</span> <span id="s201">That's why we were detached there, and they had a lot of German wounded too.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: Now, was this your first nursing activity?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: No, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s206">No, we helped in England, I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s207">Should back up to England, but yes, in England we --we worked in a hospital there for a little while, and I can't remember how long, and those-those were --we had American casualties from a big, big battle.</span> <span id="s208">That may have been --I can't remember.</span> <span id="s209">Anyhow it was very heavy fighting, big battle, very important fighting at that time, and we had many American casualties.</span> <span id="s210">That's why we had to stay in England awhile to take care of them and wait for things to calm down a little bit in Germany and France, so that--that was it until we rejoined our own hospital from this little--whatever that was.</span> <span id="s211">It was not an evac hospital, smaller than that.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: So in this little, little hospital--</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: --there were a lot of German wounded?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: And a lot of American wounded.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: A lot of American.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s218">And--</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: How was this for you as a very young, inexperienced nurse to see all these war casualties?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: I think we lived from day-to-day.</span> <span id="s221">I -- I -- I know at that time I had no thought of the war ever ending.</span> <span id="s222">Perhaps some people did, I don't know, but I think for the most part all of us were living just by the day because we didn't know if we'd be moving out the next day or what would happen because we didn't --we kept our patients --we were not supposed to keep them over 24 hours and then they were sent back to the rear, so I think we lived essentially --everything was so fast, and perhaps we were moving so fast, everything happened so fast that we didn't really think about tomorrow.</span> <span id="s223">Now, I'm sure that people who were moving our little hospital for us had to plan all of that.</span> <span id="s224">You know, the logistics had to be tremendous, but the rest --the nurses and doctors and corpsmen just lived for that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s226">So then you were moved to--</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: We would follow where the fighting was, and that would be --well, we were advancing.</span> <span id="s228">There was no retreating.</span> <span id="s229">This was toward the end of the war.</span> <span id="s230">19--early part of 1944 so you see it was --no.</span> <span id="s231">The end of 1944.</span> <span id="s232">So it was --the war was winding down--it was still very heavy fighting, but we were advancing constantly, and we were --so we had to move frequently, very frequently, and it was --I don't know how many times we moved, but it was --we'd always set up our tents in a field unless there might be a building handy that --that we could set up in which would be a --a real help for a hospital because I remember, you know, a dog could wander through the operating room in the tents, and that's just the way it was.</span> <span id="s233">Set up in muddy ground.</span> <span id="s234">No flooring, of course, for the tents.</span> <span id="s235">Just mud or dry --just dirt, whatever it happened to be at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: And were you an operating room nurse or--</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: No, no, I was just --no, I had just gotten out of --out of nursing school.</span> <span id="s238">No, I was a--general duty they called it.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: Just --and as that you're put anywhere where you're needed.</span> <span id="s241">No specialty.</span> <span id="s242">So from there--at some point we were near--there --well, we were attached--by this time we were attached to the Third Army, to Patton's Third Army, and we were somewhere near where Patton was, and I don't really know where that was, and it couldn't have been very far from the--Buchenwald, the concentration camp Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: Now, you were attached to --</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: Patton's Third Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: --Patton's Third Army.</span> <span id="s246">And your unit was?</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: The 121st Evacuation Hospital.</span> <span id="s248">A very small tent hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: So we were in --in --near Buchenwald, and Patton had been there.</span> <span id="s251">And Patton was a very tough old soldier, and he wanted everyone to visit in that area, within that area to visit Buchenwald to see what was there so they'd be --it would--become so furious.</span> <span id="s252">The war's still going on.</span> <span id="s253">Become so furious that--that it would make certainly better fighting men, determined, and I know our commanding officer thought it would not be the place for the women to --I think there were 30 or 33 of us women, very few of us.</span> <span id="s254">He did not want us to go there, but Patton said everyone would go, no exceptions, and so all of us had to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: So that meant you didn't do your nursing medical care during the time that you were going to--</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: It was just one day.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: No, we didn't but that would have meant that other --we --I don't remember all that-- we would have had to have gone in shifts.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: Right, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: And I think I must have been on the first shift because I know we were told that--that the --the camp had been liberated three days before we got there, so not very much --all they had --had been able to do was hand out food to --to the --to those who were surviving, and there were quite a few who were surviving, and they handed out food.</span> <span id="s261">Nothing had been done as far as I can think because the bodies were there.</span> <span id="s262">The crematory was still there.</span> <span id="s263">Gas chamber, everything was as it had been and –and I'm having flashbacks so --we went there on one --kind of a dismal day.</span> <span id="s264">Had to have been in the spring.</span> <span id="s265">Had no idea really --I mean you --you know, you've heard that this is going on, but --but you haven't known anyone who's seen it.</span> <span id="s266">You haven't seen the pictures because it's just been liberated, just now getting people in and getting the pictures, and so when we arrived there, I can't remember that we even spoke to each other.</span> <span id="s267">There were very few of us, so we had to have gone in shifts.</span> <span id="s268">Very few of us, and I can't remember even speaking to anybody because it was such a shock; but nobody broke down and wept or had hysterics, and I don't know if part of that was the training you've had as a medical group or not, but I just remember silence, and the shock is incredible and you --perhaps walk through in a bit of a daze because who can --who can assimilate to all of this.</span> <span id="s269">You can't.</span> <span id="s270">And we were shown through the camp.</span> <span id="s271">I don't remember by whom.</span> <span id="s272">Probably --probably some of the soldiers who had liberated them, I'm not sure, but we were shown through the camp around the grounds, and the inmates who were there were still dressed in their striped uniforms and so happy, so filled with joy and trying so hard to do anything they could for us, and I think --I could be wrong here but I think it was both American and British who liberated Buchenwald, but I'm not certain, but all I saw were American soldiers there.</span> <span id="s273">And we went through the barracks, and you want me to describe the barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: Um-hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: They were wooden buildings, not very large at all, and they had --these were just for sleeping, and they had bunk beds, as I remember it, four high with just a few inches between each two bunks so that you --you just knew --there was just no way a --a person could turn over in the bunk.</span> <span id="s276">For them to change their position to turn over, I'm sure they had to slide out and start again.</span> <span id="s277">Just a --just probably the head cleared.</span> <span id="s278">I think that was about all to get four bunks high.</span> <span id="s279">And that just seemed terrible to us, you know, with no mattresses or things like that, none of the comforts.</span> <span id="s280">And there was one --we went through one of the barracks, and there were two men there still in their striped uniforms, and they were --you've heard the expression "skin and bones."</span> <span id="s281">Well, in this case for these inmates, that was literal.</span> <span id="s282">Absolutely literal.</span> <span id="s283">And they had been given some black bread by the Americans I'm sure, and they wanted to share it with us.</span> <span id="s284">Now, had we been older, more mature, we would have accepted as their guests because who had they been able to share with or had anything to share with?</span> <span id="s285">Or even talked with freely, but we thought how can we take their bread?</span> <span id="s286">That's all they had.</span> <span id="s287">And we refused.</span> <span id="s288">Later I thought had I been older, more mature, I would have handled it differently, but we did refuse that.</span> <span id="s289">Then we were shown the --at some point the crematoria --crematoria --I guess--is it crematory or crematorium?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: Either one.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: With the bodies and, you know, ready to be cremated.</span> <span id="s292">We were shown the gas chambers and the stacks of bodies, naked bodies so high and the carts or wagons filled with them in addition to the stacks on the ground all around.</span> <span id="s293">Then we were taken to one of the Nazi administrator's offices, probably a commanding office, I'm not sure, and they pointed out this lamp shade made out of human skin, and it was a terrible thing.</span> <span id="s294">I'm about to cry.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: Do you want to stop for a minute?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">[Interview interrupted; tape recorder turned off] End of File One Beginning of File Two</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: Tape 1, Side 2.</span> <span id="s298">So you said that you saw other camps also?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s300">We --the war was over in the --maybe May 8th, I think, something like but we didn't come home right then, and we --we went --but our --we had no more American soldiers.</span> <span id="s301">Of course the fighting was over so being the kind of hospital we were, we didn't keep patients, therefore, we were just waiting until we got orders.</span> <span id="s302">In fact, we had orders to go to China.</span> <span id="s303">We never went because the war was over there too, was winding down, was over there shortly after that.</span> <span id="s304">So we went to --can't remember.</span> <span id="s305">I think somewhere --we were the first hospital across the Danube, so I think--or somewhere along the Danube, and we one day went to another concentration camp, a smaller one, and I don't know the name of this one or where it was, but I do remember it was a cold and rainy day, and we went to the --for some reason we went to the administration building.</span> <span id="s306">At the time we went there, I believe there were three of us nurses and the chief nurse, she went there for some reason, we went along with her, and we happened to be at the time that they were --that the Americans had this camp, they were issuing clothing to the inmates.</span> <span id="s307">There again they had their striped uniforms.</span> <span id="s308">I suppose because they were issuing--we were issuing --the Americans were issuing clothing, there came the men sort of in a column coming in to get their clothing, and they were stark naked, not a stitch on them.</span> <span id="s309">They came in where we --three or four women were, and they smiled, and they acted as if they were clothed, _____+ clothes.</span> <span id="s310">And we had to look at them as if they were clothed, smile at them and, of course, we didn't speak German, they didn't speak English but, you know, the --probably some handling which--you know, all that -- as if nothing had happened, and we were told that these were political prisoners; that some of the best minds in Germany were probably there, but they were not politically correct, and yet what grabbed my attention was that these men didn't seem to be aware --of course they were aware they didn't have clothes on, but they didn't seem somehow to acknowledge that.</span> <span id="s311">Some of the big brains in Europe.</span> <span id="s312">We only spent a short time there, but that never left me, that impression.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: Were you there to do nursing or--</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: --somebody thought that you should see it or...?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: No.</span> <span id="s317">Yes, I really can't remember that but a lot of this thing-- this kind of thing, I think you probably try to forget.</span> <span id="s318">I know we were --there were about three of us nurses there with --probably all lieutenants or something, younger nurses there with our chief nurse, and she was just a captain 'cause we had such a small outfit, and she was probably on some administrative mission, I don't know, but we didn't --we didn't do anything.</span> <span id="s319">We were just there with her, and --but that's what impressed me to think that these minds had regressed to that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: So something had really been done to them to almost dehumanize them.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s322">And there again skin and bones was the literal thing.</span> <span id="s323">I mean they were --the --the skin was just absolutely against their bones, and their eyes were--I would say expressionless, and yet they --they --they were glad to be alive because they were free.</span> <span id="s324">That probably doesn't make a lot of sense, but you --you knew they were glad to be alive and they were free and that--that they'd been through horrors that--that they couldn't even describe I'm sure.</span> <span id="s325">That was the second camp.</span> <span id="s326">And the third one was probably the worst, and that was somewhere near --it was in Austria near --oh, gosh.</span> <span id="s327">I could look it up, but it's probably not important.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: Well, I can stop the tape if you want to look it up.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: Well, it's probably--</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: I'll just stop the tape and you can look it up.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">[Tape recorder turned off]</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: You were looking up --you were looking up the name of the third camp, or where the third camp was.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s335">And I don't know the name of it.</span> <span id="s336">It was a --it was in an old German Luftwaffe camp.</span> <span id="s337">In fact, some of their planes were still on the ground.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: You said it was near Linz, Austria?</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: Yeah, near Linz, Austria.</span> <span id="s340">And that-- in that one, the women did not--did not do any work, didn't --because they were afraid the women would be attacked by the inmates, but our men --the men from our hospital went in and cleaned up this place because it had just been liberated too, so we were stationed there for some time while --while the men in our unit cleaned it up, took care of --set up the hospital, took care of the sick, and the women were--we were separated, I think, just by a fence, just by a fence, 'cause I remember a tall fence.</span> <span id="s341">Of course the fence had been built by the Germans to keep the inmates in but also kept us separated from them, and we were there a few weeks probably, and there were so many children and so many of these were French.</span> <span id="s342">Probably most of them were French, but there were children of all ages there, and I remember we would--maybe a couple of us nurses would go for a little walk around the compound and, of course, we couldn't go far but just go around the compound, and these children would line up around the fence.</span> <span id="s343">They weren't allowed out, and they too were absolutely skin and bones.</span> <span id="s344">No --no flesh, no muscle that you could see, just --just skin and bones.</span> <span id="s345">They'd line up at the fence looking at us, and we might have a bit of chocolate or something with us, and you'd want to give it to them, or fruit, whatever, so badly.</span> <span id="s346">Anything you had.</span> <span id="s347">But we were told --we were threatened, I suppose, can't give them anything because it would have killed them.</span> <span id="s348">They were just on liquids for several days, then they would graduate to a soft diet, then regular food.</span> <span id="s349">And one night when we were there, it was very --very striking, very impressive.</span> <span id="s350">Some of our big cargo planes, American cargo planes came--now the war is over -- came in to take these --the French people back to Paris, and they were so thrilled, so excited about going home that they took everything that was made of wood from the barracks, put it in a huge, huge pile.</span> <span id="s351">I don't know how many feet high.</span> <span id="s352">Just as high as they could stack it.</span> <span id="s353">Set it afire after dark and sang "The Marseille."</span> <span id="s354">That was impressive.</span> <span id="s355">Very, very wonderful time for them.</span> <span id="s356">And after that there --there was --we just waited to get orders to come back home.</span> <span id="s357">There were no more camps, but we stayed in that one camp until we left to come home.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: And now what was your assignment in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: We had no assignment because we weren't allowed in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s361">So you weren't--</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: The women.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: --doing any nursing or any work.</span> <span id="s364">That was just--</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: Not the women.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: --a holding --</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: Holding.</span> <span id="s368">Yet--</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: --for the women while the men --the men were inside--</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: --working and you were just waiting until--</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: Until--</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: Until they finished?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: Until they finished and got the camp cleaned up and got the patients into some sort of shape that they could leave them.</span> <span id="s375">The patients I say, the inmates, and then we came back home.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: How was it for you to come back from that to home?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: You know, then at that time you weren't expected to have any emotions.</span> <span id="s378">The hospital --the people --the hospital personnel was not expected to have any emotion because you had to do all you could to help those who --who had --who were traumatized, and I don't think any of us were ever considered to be traumatized.</span> <span id="s379">I guess you weren't allowed to be, and there was --and I can't even remember discussing this with any of--any of the other nurses or doctors or corpsmen who were there.</span> <span id="s380">It was just --you saw it and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: And after you came back home, you didn't talk about it either?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: Hum-um.</span> <span id="s383">No.</span> <span id="s384">Nobody talked about it.</span> <span id="s385">You might --you might say a little bit now and then.</span> <span id="s386">I know to my --you know, after I had my children, they got older, I did tell them, and once in awhile now I'll tell somebody a little bit about it, but it was something that wasn't discussed, and now I think it's entirely different.</span> <span id="s387">They encourage discussion and --and it is therapeutic, but then no.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: So you told your children a little bit about it, but you never--</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: I probably told them a lot.</span> <span id="s390">I probably told them a lot when they got older.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: Because you thought it was important for them to know that--</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: --you--</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s395">I wanted them to know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: Why did you want them to know?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: Because my generation is the last generation that had the --the firsthand contact, firsthand knowledge, and I know that there are people who believe it never happened, and I think there will be more who will refuse to believe it ever happened, and I think it's wonderful what the Holocaust Museum--the records they are keeping of this because I think it must be, must be kept for history, for the future generations, and I think it's great you're getting the interviews now because it--my --well, I say my generation is the last.</span> <span id="s398">Of course the children of the inmates in the concentration camp will have some memories.</span> <span id="s399">That's the next generation, but probably there are not too many of them and so I think it's very important.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: So what was it like for you after you came back to the States?</span> <span id="s401">Did you stay in the Army for awhile, or were you discharged?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: I stayed in the Army for awhile.</span> <span id="s403">Not very long.</span> <span id="s404">Well, maybe a couple of years, something like that.</span> <span id="s405">And then I got married and got out.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: So you got out because you got married?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: Um-hum.</span> <span id="s408">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: How was it being in the Army those two years when you came back home?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: It was --well, I was --actually we had mostly men from--not men and women, but men from the-- from the--Europe, from the war --well, from the --from the Pacific too.</span> <span id="s411">These were the patients we had so it's still family and--because you were sort of family with the patients of those who had been through the same thing that you had and had seen what you had seen, so it wasn't --I don't know, it was just a continuation somehow.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: And in that circumstance, people didn't talk much about what they'd been through?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: No.</span> <span id="s414">No.</span> <span id="s415">The men who had been --those who may have been --may have been through Africa, Italy, and Germany, terribly wounded, severely ____+</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: Do you remember whether you thought about --about it, what you had been through and the condition that some of them were in?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s418">We thought about it.</span> <span id="s419">We just didn't talk about it.</span> <span id="s420">And I don't know why, but the --the men --saw a lot of those patients, saw a lot of them, and now they're --now we're in a stationary general hospital where you keep your patients so you get to know these patients and you're with them for weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: And you go through a lot with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: Go through a lot with them 'cause they were terribly wounded.</span> <span id="s423">The hospital where I was, one of them was in California.</span> <span id="s424">It was plastic surgery, and these were mostly burned patients.</span> <span id="s425">Terribly burned with much rehabilitation.</span> <span id="s426">In fact, we were in --we were in Pasadena, in the McCornack General Hospital in Pasadena, California, which --and at that time Pasadena was populated by mostly retired, very wealthy people, and they did not want our patients in their restaurants, on their streets.</span> <span id="s427">Anywhere.</span> <span id="s428">They didn't want them out of the hospital because they were --they didn't want to see them because they were too --too badly wounded.</span> <span id="s429">Too disfigured, terribly disfigured.</span> <span id="s430">So much --so many had burned faces, and --and they were re-making their faces, reconstructing, and they didn't want them in their restaurants.</span> <span id="s431">Now, on one hand, it would be hard to go into a restaurant and sit --sit next to these patients.</span> <span id="s432">On the other hand, these people had defended them, and we were very angry.</span> <span id="s433">The nurses and doctors were very angry about it, and we'd go out with them because the --the men were too embarrassed to go out with anyone but hospital personnel, so the nurses would go out with them and --and maybe to --to a restaurant where they had dancing after and that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s434">And at that time I could not understand how anybody could treat them so cruelly but now I see, maybe they did have a little bit of a point because it would be very hard for them to face, for the civilians to face if they hadn't been exposed to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: But it was tough for you at the time to see that happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: Hurt very, very much 'cause these --these men were our --our --in addition to being our patients, they were good friends.</span> <span id="s437">Very good friends, and yes, it hurt.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: So you were at the Army hospital in Pasadena, and where else did you serve?</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: Texas.</span> <span id="s440">Louisiana.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: What --what was the hospital in Texas?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: Oh.</span> <span id="s443">Camp Swift.</span> <span id="s444">The hospital.</span> <span id="s445">Hospitals all have names.</span> <span id="s446">I can't remember that name.</span> <span id="s447">And Camp Polk in Louisiana.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: Did you meet your husband in the military?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s450">I met him in California.</span> <span id="s451">I met him at --in Pasadena.</span> <span id="s452">He was in the Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: Was he--</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: In x-ray.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: Oh, so he was assigned to the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: He was in x-ray.</span> <span id="s457">Then got out of the Army, and I didn't --didn't do any more nursing.</span> <span id="s458">I guess I just did another year when the Korean War broke out in 1950, and we were in Michigan.</span> <span id="s459">I was in a hospital for a year treating Korean War casualties.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: Now, you were in the Army or--</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: As a civilian?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: I was a civilian then.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: So you were a civilian working in an Army hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: In an Army hospital for a year, and that was the end of my nursing career.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: And you previously had stopped nursing when you got married?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s468">For about two years I guess.</span> <span id="s469">Yes, I think that was two years it was, and the Korean War broke out, and we went to Percy Jones Hospital in Michigan, and they were desperate for civilian nurses, any kind of --you know, Army nurses, civilian nurses, whatever they could get, and they got all the civilian nurses they could get in addition to the Army nurses.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: So did your husband also work in the Army hospital--</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: Um-hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: --when you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: Um-hum.</span> <span id="s474">He was a master sergeant in --maybe not at that time.</span> <span id="s475">He was a master sergeant in x-ray, and he was in charge of the --I guess the master serge --the enlisted men in charge of x-radiology.</span> <span id="s476">I'm missing that somehow, but anyhow he was --he was always in radiology.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: Did he stay in the Army?</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: He retired.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: After you got married?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s481">He retired and--</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: He retired when from the Army?</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: Goodness me.</span> <span id="s484">After 24 years and that was--</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: Oh, I see.</span> <span id="s486">So after you were married, he continued in the Army?</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: Then--he retired here from Walter Reed.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: So that's how you got to the Washington area?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: That's how we came to the Washington areA: Been here for many years.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: Was he overseas at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: No.</span> <span id="s494">He didn't go overseas.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: So he didn't have the war experience that you had.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: No, he didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: Did you ever talk with him about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: Very --no, I didn't really.</span> <span id="s499">I guess maybe not at all perhaps.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: Do you keep in touch with any of the people that you were overseas with?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: Yes, I did --not now.</span> <span id="s502">I did, oh, for years, I did with two.</span> <span id="s503">Two special people.</span> <span id="s504">Actually three.</span> <span id="s505">Three.</span> <span id="s506">And then, you know, our --our paths have diverged and, oh, one of them is dead, and I did keep in contact with her until she died.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: So even though you didn't talk about it, you were in contact with people--</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: Um-hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: --who had been through what you had been through?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s511">We never mentioned it.</span> <span id="s512">And--and I --now I find that strange.</span> <span id="s513">I never felt it strange, but now I do find that really strange.</span> <span id="s514">We never mentioned it.</span> <span id="s515">So I don't know where any of them are now, and --and I'm sure some --I know this one is dead, perhaps some others.</span> <span id="s516">Because I was actually next to the youngest in the group of nurses.</span> <span id="s517">Therefore, if I'm 75, they would be older.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: So do you think much or some or at all about those experiences overseas now?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: Quite a bit.</span> <span id="s520">I suppose everyone does quite a bit.</span> <span id="s521">You know, you don't really get hung up on it, but you'll have these flashbacks and --or something will remind you of what happened then and --yeah.</span> <span id="s522">So I guess I do think about it quite a bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: Do you think that it changed you in any way to have gone through all that?</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: You know, I never thought so.</span> <span id="s525">I never thought so, and yet my son one day said to me, he said, "You know, Mom"--he knew someone at work, some woman, and she said her mother had similar experiences, and she thought "I think it's affected my mother.</span> <span id="s526">I don't know how, and he said, "And I said to her, you know, it probably did my mother too."</span> <span id="s527">I didn't ask him how.</span> <span id="s528">Just --I stay off that subject.</span> <span id="s529">So I don't think it --I never thought it did.</span> <span id="s530">Maybe it did.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: Well, it's hard to know what it would have been like if you hadn't have done that 'cause--</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s533">May have been the very same.</span> <span id="s534">Who knows but it was an experience that you could well do without.</span> <span id="s535">I had a woman one time tell me that she didn't think it ever happened, and I don't know why she said that.</span> <span id="s536">We weren't talking about it, but she said that she didn't believe that there were ever any concentration camps.</span> <span id="s537">She thought that was a lot of propaganda, and I--I'm thinking you're talking to the wrong person, and she talked quite a bit about it until I finally just stopped her and told her whatever --I don't remember what I told her, but anyhow I told her the truth.</span> <span id="s538">I was shocked.</span> <span id="s539">That shocked me as much as anything probably to think that somebody --she was older than I, so she had been through --in the States.</span> <span id="s540">She had known what was going on.</span> <span id="s541">I mean she had heard --she had to have heard.</span> <span id="s542">No way she could have avoided newspapers, radios, what was going on, and yet she thought that was all propaganda.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: How did she take it when you told her?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: Well, I felt that she didn't believe a word of it.</span> <span id="s545">Then not long ago, I met a woman and she was – and I don't --I don't know why the subject came up, but she was telling me that her father-in-law --I don't know, someone, someone in her family did not believe it ever happened.</span> <span id="s546">Was propaganda.</span> <span id="s547">So again someone else didn't believe it, and then I --that makes me believe there might be a lot of people that believe this never happened, therefore, the story has to be told, has to be kept because I can't imagine there'd be anyone who would think it hadn't happened.</span> <span id="s548">I know they're teaching it in the schools today, and there --they --I think they're teaching it--quite a bit about it, and yet there are those who don't believe, and I can't --apparently they don't want to believe it.</span> <span id="s549">Why don't they want to believe?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: Hard to understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: Um-hum.</span> <span id="s552">Have you heard that there are people who don't believe it?</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: And why do they not believe it, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: I don't know.</span> <span id="s556">Hard to --it's hard to understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: So do you think if these people--those people who do not believe would go through the museum, the Holocaust museum, they'd still not believe?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: I don't know whether they would or not, but I think your testimony's a very important piece of documenting that it did happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: Thank you.</span> <span id="s560">There are lots of us out here I'm sure.</span> <span id="s561">Lots of books are being written now too.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: Yes, there are.</span> <span id="s563">Is there anything else that you would like to say?</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: I don't think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: Anything that I've forgotten to ask you?</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: I --I don't think so.</span> <span id="s567">No, I don't believe that--would have nothing do with the concentration camps so I don't think there is anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: Well, that's all right.</span> <span id="s569">If there's something else that you want to say.</span> <span id="s570">Doesn't have to be directly connected.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A: It would just be experiences that--that would have no bearing on it so I think it's probably unimportant as far as this goes.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q: Experiences in the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: Um-hum.</span> <span id="s574">Would have no bearing on --on --on the --well, it would have had some bearing on the Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: Do you want something--</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: If you want to.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: --or just want to hang around?</span> <span id="s579">Oh, I found it very interesting that we--oh, I shouldn't say interesting.</span> <span id="s580">That's not--not a good description.</span> <span id="s581">Exciting.</span> <span id="s582">And something I was glad to do that we didn't --we --of course you heard about Dunkirk.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: Um-hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: We were set up in Germany when some of the men who were captured at Dunkirk, this is five years later, had been prisoners of the Germans all this time.</span> <span id="s585">Not in a concentration camp but a prison camp.</span> <span id="s586">Were liberated.</span> <span id="s587">Came back through our hospital for just a few hours 'cause we were still this little tent in the field, and all very --had been wounded seriously and had --had very little care given.</span> <span id="s588">Desperately needed care.</span> <span id="s589">But they weren't interested in that so much as we were the first English-speaking women they had seen in five years, and they wanted to know what was going on in England, and --and we were so happy and --oh, they were probably there a couple of hours before they went back to the --to the rear, and it was just exciting to talk with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: And to see how excited they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s592">Yes.</span> <span id="s593">Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s594">And they had heard that the --they had just heard--because they got no news in the prison camps, no letters from home.</span> <span id="s595">Nothing.</span> <span id="s596">They had no idea what was going on in England, but they had just heard that the American soldiers were marrying all of the English women and that was a terrible thing for them to have to hear, and we were happy to tell them not so.</span> <span id="s597">So then they went on back to England I'm sure very quickly.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: Well, you must have had days and days of very dreary times so to have something like that happen would certainly--</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: Be --</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: --give you a different mood.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: Yes, it was.</span> <span id="s604">And I think that's probably all that I have to say.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s606">Well, I want to thank you very much for giving your testimony.</span> <span id="s607">It's very important for the museum to have this.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: Thank you.</span> <span id="s609">You're very welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: This concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Roberta Jones.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">End of File
