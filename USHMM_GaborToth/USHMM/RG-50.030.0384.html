and my mother, they moved to Nice, France, where my father had a hotel with his brother, so I lived my first five, six years in Nice.</span> <span id="s20">Then they moved back to Bucharest, where he had a factory with another brother of his, textile factory, so then I went to school in Bucharest and then we lived in Bucharest until 1935.</span> <span id="s21">Then my parents divorced and I was sent to Paris and then I went to school, in Fontainbleu, which is just, few south of Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: Did you, did you live in Paris with your mother or with your

<p><span id="s26">A: My father remained in Bucharest and I was sent to Paris and then to Fontainbleu, where I was in school.</span> <span id="s27">Then, after couple of years, my father took me back to Bucharest and then I went to school in Bucharest.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: So, in France you stayed until which year please?</span> <span id="s29">A: Until 1930, sometime about 1935, '36?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: Do you remember any anti-Semitic incidents during your childhood in France?</span> <span id="s31">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: No.</span> <span id="s33">So what happened to you once you came back to Bucharest?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: Well then, then I had problems in school.</span> <span id="s35">There were a number of incidents in which being Jewish, they pick up fights and things like that and eventually, in '38, the Jews were kicked off of the Romanian schools and actually I think we formed our own school, only Jews were in that school, private school, until 1939, in the 1940 and then in 1940 there was no more, no more school, nothing for the Jews and myself included.</span> <span id="s36">Then we start, authority insisted that we should wear bands with the Star of David, with the yellow bands and everywhere we go we had to use these, we had to carry these bands and we were not allowed in the street cars, so we had to find our own transportation.</span> <span id="s37">Sometime the street car, we were allowed to go in the second wagon of the street car.</span> <span id="s38">And then of course, we were called.</span> <span id="s39">I was, what I was, seventeen, we were called into what they call labor camps and we were taken.</span> <span id="s40">In the morning we had to report to the labor camp, which was just outside Bucharest and were supposed to dig trenches.</span> <span id="s41">These trenches were made specifically for training of German soldiers, targets.</span> <span id="s42">And we were, we are, we were kept there by Romanian soldiers, until evening, until dark, then we were allowed to go home.</span> <span id="s43">And the next morning, of course, we had to report back.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: When, when did this forced labor start?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: 1940, I would say.</span> <span id="s46">As far as I know.</span> <span id="s47">But of course there were a lot of rumors, you know.</span> <span id="s48">First, just at the end of 1939, there was a pogrom in the Jewish quarter of Bucharest, in , where they have shot a lot of Jews, just in the streets.</span> <span id="s49">Then, in another time, they start picking up Jews and they were taking them to, to a forest, the and then they killed them there.</span> <span id="s50">Of course all these were not published in newspapers, you only hear these things.</span> <span id="s51">So things were getting worse every day and the labor camp was, they were talking about not letting us go out in the evening, home they were, wanted us to start sleeping there too.</span> <span id="s52">So my father saw that this is getting to be very dangerous to live there, so he decided that he has to get me out of Bucharest.</span> <span id="s53">So he manage, with money of course, he managed to get me a passport and of course the passport had the stamp, Jew, on it, .</span> <span id="s54">Anyway and, and finally they, they were talking about a group of Jewish people from the Batar(ph) organization to immigrate, try to get out.</span> <span id="s55">So you, but they didn't had enough money, the Batar(ph) organization, so they decided to take some outside Jews to help them financially in getting, getting the vessel, cost of the vessel.</span> <span id="s56">So my father paid, I don't know, quite a sum of money, so that I get a seat or I get a place in that, in that vessel that they were organizing and slowly, slowly the time arrived that, that they had a group of people, including the Batar(ph) and so forth, that were ready to be sent to Constanza(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: Who, who found out about this vessel and about this project, you or your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: My father.</span> <span id="s59">I was, I was working in the labor camps, so I, from dusk to, til evening, so I had no, the only thing was, when I was coming home, I was hearing the rumors .</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: So you didn't take care of any, any formality?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: No, I did not take care any formalities.</span> <span id="s62">But eventually he got permission for me to, to get out of that labor camp.</span> <span id="s63">It was just the time when they were already organizing that not to let anybody get out of that labor camp, so he paid somebody to get the permission to, to take me basically, to the railway station and took me to the railway station and there were hundreds of people of course.</span> <span id="s64">Those that were preparing to go on Shtruma(ph), ready to board that train.</span> <span id="s65">Then I was, there were, they locked up the whole train, every wagon was locked up and the train moved to Constanza(ph), took them about a couple of days and in Constanza(ph), they parked the train and they did not unload the train and we were kept in a train, a couple of days until finally they said all right, the vessel is ready to be boarded.</span> <span id="s66">They did not allow us to get out of the train until actually right into the Customs.</span> <span id="s67">They did the customs, naturally the inspectors start checking everything that we had with us and any jewelry, any money, anything of any kind of a value, we had to leave to the Customs.</span> <span id="s68">We were just allowed to take clothing.</span> <span id="s69">So, after we got through the Custom, quite rude Customs, they just took everything they could lay their hands on.</span> <span id="s70">Then we were allowed, we were allowed to board the ship, that we never seen it before, so, and each one had a particular place.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: Let's, let's go back please, one second and talk about the papers that you carried with you.</span> <span id="s72">So you had the passport, you had a ticket, did you have a, an immigration visa?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: No.</span> <span id="s74">A passport with no, nothing in it except my picture and of course the stamp Jew on it and the ticket that was issued by the organization in Bucharest with my picture on it and things like that.</span> <span id="s75">I am a passenger on, on board Shtruma(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: Can you describe please a ship?</span> <span id="s77">A: The ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: The ship was very funny looking ship, in respect that there is, as you board the ship there is only one way of going down the ship and the ship was built sort of like cubicles and in order for you to go into your bunker, you had to crawl into it, there was not enough space for you even to sit and we all crawled into our spaces and we could not even move in the bunker, we were so close to each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: So there were several layers?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: Many, many layers.</span> <span id="s82">The top, I would say about six or seven layers, so that you had to pull yourself in and then underneath same kind, but the only thing you could see that there was steel, up was wood.</span> <span id="s83">So the lower portion was, you could hit the steel and upper portion, it was wood.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: So it was a huge, let's see, a big boat made from steel, on which they built a sort of superstructure.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: Superstructure, wood superstructure, correct.</span> <span id="s86">And of course we were too many of us on this vessel.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: How many?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: Over 700 people.</span> <span id="s89">So, because we were so many, they told us we cannot go up on the deck, all of us, so we were given times when we were, were, about maximum 100 people could be on deck, so we took shifts when we could go on deck and toilets were in, very few of them and it was just a terrible conditions.</span> <span id="s90">From the beginning we saw that it's, it would be worse than a prison because the air was difficult even to breathe.</span> <span id="s91">And yes there is one thing I would like to mention, that after we finished with the Romanian customs, then we passed through the people that organized the vessel.</span> <span id="s92">Now they restricted us exactly to 10 kilos of baggage.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">One piece, 10 kilos.</span> <span id="s94">Anything over that has to be left behind.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: Are you saying that these people who restricted you were not the Romanian Customs, but the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: I don't know whether they were people, but anyway they were part of the organization of the, of the vessel.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: We had no choice, no time to even to ask who are you.</span> <span id="s99">They told , "You're going to board now, but you have to, you have to leave everything above the 10 kilos."</span> <span id="s100">And they had, of course, a scale.</span> <span id="s101">You put your suitcase on a scale.</span> <span id="s102">My suitcase was, if I remember correctly, something around 15 kilos.</span> <span id="s103">They said, "You have to unload it."</span> <span id="s104">So we unloaded several things and then we put back, it was 12 kilos.</span> <span id="s105">Unload it again until it was 10 kilos, then we were allowed to proceed.</span> <span id="s106">So imagine so many people waiting, waiting.</span> <span id="s107">So it took us forever just to embark on this vessel.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: Why do you think they did this?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: I think they were afraid of overweight already.</span> <span id="s110">Already the ship was meant for less than half of the people that we were.</span> <span id="s111">When actually, in order to obtain more funds, they allowed more people to join, until it became 700, over 760 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: Did you feel in any way that the ship was unstable, not very stable because of it's load?</span> <span id="s113">A: I doubted that we ever made anywhere and everybody, everybody was so flabbergasted, shall we say, that this, that a thing like what they call a vessel will manage to take us so far away.</span> <span id="s114">We doubted that it will ever be able to leave the port.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: How big was the crew?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: We haven't seen the crew until actually when we're all on board.</span> <span id="s117">We, we were told that the crew, it's a Bulgarian captain and a Bulgarian chief officer and several Bulgarian, the whole crew was a Bulgarian crew, about seven or eight people.</span> <span id="s118">And actually we seldom saw the, the captain altogether, but you see, we were so, so many of us, that we have, we were not manage, we were not managing even to walk around.</span> <span id="s119">We were glad when we were allowed to go on, on the deck for a few hours just to breathe a little bit of better air.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: Can you please describe the journey?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: The journey, we left Constanza(ph) at night.</span> <span id="s122">We were pulled out of the port by a tug, a Romanian tug and once they took us out into the sea, they disconnected and they left.</span> <span id="s123">Then, we tried to work the engines, we had a very, very hard time to make the engine work.</span> <span id="s124">It pop up and then stopped again.</span> <span id="s125">Anyway, I think it took us practically all night and the engine still didn't, didn't start.</span> <span id="s126">Then I understand that we had, start sending SOS's because the vessel was floating into the sea, but it was not moving anywhere.</span> <span id="s127">The captain send SOS's and eventually, now the, now the next day, the same tug, tugboat that took us, pulled us out, came back.</span> <span id="s128">It came back and we requested that they, if they could repair so that the engine can start.</span> <span id="s129">They tried and tried but they told us that it would cost us money.</span> <span id="s130">So we explained that we are left with no funds at all because the, the Custom took away everything we had.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">So then they requested that we, everybody that has a wedding ring, which were, miraculously we were allowed to keep.</span> <span id="s132">I didn't had one, but in any case, many, many, many people had.</span> <span id="s133">So we collected all the wedding rings from the people and we gave them to the crew of that tugboat.</span> <span id="s134">Then they went into the engine and they start playing around with the engine and they said, they, two conditions.</span> <span id="s135">If we give them enough money, they may be able to pull us all the way into the Turkish waters, which would take us about a day or so.</span> <span id="s136">But if we don't have enough money, then they said okay, we'll try to repair the engine and if the engine works, we are going to be with you, floating next to the vessel, into the international water, close to the Turkey, Turkish waters and then we will leave you there.</span> <span id="s137">So finally the engine start working and we start sailing towards Turkey and the tugboat was going next to us and then it went away and it took us about three, four days because it was very, very slow, until we reach the so called border with the Turkish territorial waters.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: Did you know other passengers on the ship, did you talk to them during the journey?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: Oh yes, of course.</span> <span id="s140">First I had the girlfriend, my, we were actually engaged and she came with both of her parents.</span> <span id="s141">They were, their place was way below, in the vessel's belly, like.</span> <span id="s142">So and I was completely on different side of the vessel.</span> <span id="s143">But we managed to see each other from time to time, somehow.</span> <span id="s144">She was with her two parents.</span> <span id="s145">And I had also two friends from school that were also on the boat and several other people that I knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: Did you talk to them during the ?</span> <span id="s147">A: Yes, yes I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: Did you know Yakov Berkovitz(ph), the leader of Batar(ph) on the ship?</span> <span id="s149">A: No, I did not know him.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: Did you feel that there was any organized or organization or organized life on the ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: We, we knew that of course there is a Batar(ph) that organized everything, but we have very little communication with them, so and besides that, as I said, there was no way of moving around, so each one just stayed in it's quarters until we were allowed to go to, on, on the deck for a, for a, for a short time and then back there.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: So basically everything that you knew about the trip, during the trip, was by way of rumors?</span> <span id="s153">A: Exactly, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: So what happened when you got closer to Istanbul?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: When we got closer to Istanbul, the engine stopped working and the boat was floating, you know, towards the, the shore.</span> <span id="s156">It was right in the other opening of the Bosporus(ph) Straights and the rumor was that we were too close to mines, because the Turkish waters were mined and there were only certain passages that they can get through.</span> <span id="s157">So but we had no way of knowing how to get through.</span> <span id="s158">But suddenly a Turkish tug appeared, from the Bosporus(ph) and tied us up and pulled us through the Turkish water and took us right into the Istanbul harbor.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: So let's summarize for one second.</span> <span id="s160">You left Constanza(ph), on the Black Sea, you left Romania on what date?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: That was eleventh, eleventh of December of 1941.</span> <span id="s162">Q: And you arrived in, in Istanbul?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: About fourteenth or fifteenth of December.</span> <span id="s164">Q: Okay, so what happened next?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: In Istanbul we anchored, in the middle of Istanbul, which is quite a, quite a big area, between the Asian and the European sides, right?</span> <span id="s166">So you have, the port is on the Asian side, but as well as on the European side, we're right in the middle of that big water, like a lake.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: So you are not close to the shore?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: No, we were pretty far away from both shores, but anchored right there in the middle.</span> <span id="s169">And of course we had then, Turkish police came on board and they came, they were constantly on board the vessel and we stayed there for about two months.</span> <span id="s170">From what we understand, that the Turks will not allow us to go into the Mediterranean.</span> <span id="s171">We couldn't go forward, we couldn't go backwards and the engines were irreparable on board ship.</span> <span id="s172">So finally I understand, we got permission for mechanics to come on board, remove the engine, take it ashore and try to repair it ashore.</span> <span id="s173">So they removed the engine.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: So, if my understanding is correct, one of the problems was that you, you, the passengers didn't have an immigration visa for Palestine, correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: Right, first we did not have any immigration visa for Palestine, secondly we had no visas for Turkey, we were not allowed to get out of the vessel and we had to stay aboard until somehow they would manage to repair the engine.</span> <span id="s176">Meanwhile of course there were all kinds of rumors that were going on.</span> <span id="s177">First, rumors that maybe there is a chance that they childrens will be allowed to disembark.</span> <span id="s178">And there were quite a lot of children on board.</span> <span id="s179">Then there were rumored that maybe they will allow us, they will make a camp on the Asian side of the Turkey and allow us to stay there, until somehow it will be resolved what to do with us.</span> <span id="s180">All these things never materialized, neither the children, neither going on board.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">But, what did happen is that finally nine people that were on board with expired immigration papers for Palestine, they got permission to be taken out of the vessel and then to be, to proceed to Palestine.</span> <span id="s182">So the nine people, nine person disembark, were allowed to disembark during those two months that we stay there.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: Did you ever see spokesman in Turkey?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: I saw him, not on ship.</span> <span id="s185">He picked me up when I was in the police station.</span> <span id="s186">Q: So later?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: Much later, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: Did you ever see any British representative of the ship?</span> <span id="s189">A: No, I did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: So the only contact that you, as passengers, had, was with the Turkish authorities?</span> <span id="s191">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: Could you be so kind to describe the sanitary conditions on the ship during these two months?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: They were terrible.</span> <span id="s194">First of all, we had not enough food, we were just eating biscuits.</span> <span id="s195">Finally we understood that the Jewish agency in Istanbul got permission to export some food to the vessel, but it was all dried food and the only thing they allowed water to be, you know, water tanks to come and fill up that, the vessel's tanks and the sanitary condition was just, I would say atrocious because we had no opportunity to wash ourselves.</span> <span id="s196">A lot of people start getting fleas, there were a lot of sickness, vomiting and, and people crying and it was quite a, a very difficult position to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: Do you remember a ship committee, on the ship during this period?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: Yes, the Batar(ph) organized some kind of a committee and they tried to keep people from, from getting wild, like trying to get out on the deck and things like that.</span> <span id="s199">But actually, people were so, shall we say, flabbergasted by this happening, that it's like they gave up living.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">They, they, as the time was passing, they, we start believing that we never get out of this, because nothing is moving, you know.</span> <span id="s201">On top of it, we don't even have an engine, never mind going someplace.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: So the engine was gone?</span> <span id="s203">A: Gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: It was ashore, in order to be repaired?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: Right.</span> <span id="s206">And the engine was never returned to the vessel.</span> <span id="s207">Q: Never returned?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: Never returned.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: How do you know this?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: Because we were very surprised on the twenty-third of February, a tug, coming and start pulling us out.</span> <span id="s211">First of all, we see a, quite a huge tugboat coming and trying to tie us up to the tug.</span> <span id="s212">Then we have, we see people coming and they did not pull the anchor, they cut the anchor.</span> <span id="s213">Now, the anchor is made out of steel, so they came and physically cut the anchor.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: Did you, did you witness this, or?</span> <span id="s215">A: I saw it myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: You saw it.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: First of all you hear it, you know, when they try to cut off the anchor and, and secondly, you could see the boat, because the boat, trying to, when the boat, the tugboat tried, the people from the boat tried to attach the vessel, quite a number of people tried to prevent them from doing that.</span> <span id="s218">Obviously we had some suspicion about that, so we, we prevented them to come to attach it, so that the police start pushing us back.</span> <span id="s219">So quite a commotion for quite a while until the police manage to push us back into our, below the vessel.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: Did you see the Turkish police on the boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s222">All the time and of course when this happened, we had quite a, quite an army of police to subdue us.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: So you were on the deck when they pushed you back?</span> <span id="s224">A: Yes, I was.</span> <span id="s225">I remember that they start pushing us back.</span> <span id="s226">Q: What happened next?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: Well the next they managed to attach the, the tug, managed to attach the rope to the front of the boat and they start pulling us, that was already nighttime.</span> <span id="s228">They start pulling us back into the Black Sea, back to the Bosporus(ph).</span> <span id="s229">Took several hours, they pull us out, out in the, back into the Black Sea, then they cut off, they cut off the rope and they left.</span> <span id="s230">Of course, we shouted, what are we supposed to do now?</span> <span id="s231">They start yelling, "Go back to Borgaz(ph)."</span> <span id="s232">Why Borgaz(ph), I don't know, this is one small port in Bulgaria.</span> <span id="s233">We did not understand at all, but they left and we were now floating fairly close to the shores, because we could hear noises from the shore.</span> <span id="s234">At night of course, you could not see the shore, just noises and we were just floating, no engine.</span> <span id="s235">Of course we were worried about mines, we were worried about everything and where do we go without engine?</span> <span id="s236">Until morning time, morning came and then of course you have a big bang and the whole thing blows up.</span> <span id="s237">And I was projected way up in the air, suddenly.</span> <span id="s238">Now, I was exactly, my bunker was right under the deck, so the whole thing blew up and I was in the air and then I was in the water.</span> <span id="s239">And as I was in the water, naturally, were quite a lot of people in the water.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: How many?</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: Hundreds.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: Alive or dead?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: All alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: All alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: Or at least they were swimming, you know.</span> <span id="s246">People here, there, quite a number of people were swimming all over the place, including myself.</span> <span id="s247">And then yelling and yelling, help, help .</span> <span id="s248">Women, women and men, no I haven't seen any children in the water.</span> <span id="s249">And we were floating, it was pretty cold, but luckily the sea was not, was quite calm, just very cold.</span> <span id="s250">And slowly, slowly, I was seeing less people and less people and less people floating.</span> <span id="s251">At that time, I saw a piece of deck that had bars and it was quite, you couldn't see the, what was there, but people were holding on these bars and as people left, died or frozen, this piece of deck was getting up and up and eventually you could see that there was a piece of, oh, I would say about, let's see, five meters by six meters, something of this sort.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: Of wood?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: Of wood, the piece of, so the deck was quite thick and so I was also holding on one of these bars.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: You were in the water?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: In the water, so by just flipping over, I was now on top of the deck and as people were drowning, naturally the deck was getting lighter and going towards the surface, so eventually I was on this deck, oh with about, let's see, about a foot of water above.</span> <span id="s256">I was still all the time in water, but at least I did not have any more the necessity of swimming.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: Were you dressed?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: Yes, completely dressed.</span> <span id="s259">In actual fact I had a leather jacket, leather kind, it was of course quite heavy because it was full of water.</span> <span id="s260">But, in any case, I saw also some kind of piece of, of bench that usually was on deck.</span> <span id="s261">It was attached with wires on this piece of deck, so by pulling this bench on top of this deck, now if I sit, when I sit on the bench, I was about a few inches above water.</span> <span id="s262">So now I was above, holding to that piece, above water.</span> <span id="s263">Towards the evening...</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: So, so, I'm sorry to interrupt.</span> <span id="s265">A: That's all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: You were in the water, the explosion was sometimes in the morning, after drifting for one night...</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: On the sea, correct?</span> <span id="s269">You stayed on this bench until towards the evening?</span> <span id="s270">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s272">At this moment, how many people did you see around you?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: No, I, I saw one, which I, dead, further away from the, from the, from the deck, but it was entangled in wires.</span> <span id="s274">That was a person there.</span> <span id="s275">I could not reach him because I was myself not very mobile.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: And that was it, the rest of the people were gone?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: No more people.</span> <span id="s278">But, towards the evening I see a man, sitting on something which obviously it was a door, he was sitting on the door and paddling.</span> <span id="s279">So, he came towards me, so I pulled him up and sat him on the bench.</span> <span id="s280">And that was the chief officer, a Bulgarian.</span> <span id="s281">So he, at that time, started talking in Russian.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: You knew Russian?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: Yes, it's my mother language.</span> <span id="s284">He told me that he happened to be on the deck in the morning.</span> <span id="s285">He was the, he was on duty on deck, when he saw something floating towards the ship, from the shore.</span> <span id="s286">It was like, looked like a torpedo anyway, that was coming towards the vessel, so he run from the deck towards the captain's cabin and as he was opening the door of the captain's cabin, the explosion took him in the air and when he landed in the water, he landed with that door in his hands, with the knob in his hands.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: This is the door on which he was paddling?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: Right.</span> <span id="s289">So what he did eventually, he went on the door and that, that how he managed to stay in the water.</span> <span id="s290">So when I pulled him, I pulled him off this door.</span> <span id="s291">So, he says that the only way we can survive is really by us shouting all the time, so that we don't fall asleep, because if we fall asleep we will never wake up any longer.</span> <span id="s292">So we were sitting back to back on this bench and yelling all night.</span> <span id="s293">And as the, the night came, as the day came along, we were already exhausted of yelling.</span> <span id="s294">And then we stopped and, and then I felt that he is not any longer on my back.</span> <span id="s295">I turned around and he, he fell from the bench onto the deck and his head was in the water like on his belly.</span> <span id="s296">In other words, he could not possibly breathe any longer, he was dead.</span> <span id="s297">And, but he was very close to me, but just a corpse.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: So you were in the water for?</span> <span id="s299">A: About 24 hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: 24 hours.</span> <span id="s301">We are now in the morning.</span> <span id="s302">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: You could see the shore?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: All the time.</span> <span id="s305">Soon as the, day, day, the daylight came, I could see the shore and you could hear the noises of the shore, like an engine, pumping engine and things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: Did you think about trying to reach the shore?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s308">Then I decided, maybe I'll be able to swim to the shore.</span> <span id="s309">So I jump into the water.</span> <span id="s310">What happened is, if you take, from the bench and you land into the water, you are much lower into the water, now the shore was quite far away.</span> <span id="s311">So I swim a little bit and I could hardly move, so I turned around and went back.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: To the deck?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: To the deck.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: And to the bench.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: To the bench.</span> <span id="s316">I was only a few yards away and I realized that the shore is much further away than I thought, because of the, on the, when you are on the bench, you can see further than when you are in the water.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: Do you remember anything about what you were thinking during that night?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: I was, knew that obviously I am going to die from drowning and I, I was not looking forward that kind of death.</span> <span id="s319">So I was contemplating to cut my veins or something that is a quick death.</span> <span id="s320">So while I was contemplating what I'm going to do next, suddenly I see quite a big vessel, fairly close, sailing in, in the, in the ocean, in the sea.</span> <span id="s321">So I looked up and I see people on deck on that vessel that moving pretty fast, like a cargo, it was like a cargo vessel, with a few people there.</span> <span id="s322">And they were pointing towards the shore, so I yelled at them, but they, they pointing toward the shore.</span> <span id="s323">So I concluded they tell me to swim to the shore, which I already tried.</span> <span id="s324">Anyway, the vessel goes away and then I see a boat with sailors coming towards me.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">So my conclusion was that that vessel, the people on the vessel, the sailors on the vessel pointed out not to the shore, but that somebody's coming.</span> <span id="s326">Of course they came, they picked me up into the, into the boat, they pick up the chief officer and the other corpse there, all three of us on, in the, in this boat and they took us ashore.</span> <span id="s327">These were sailors from the lighthouse, which you could see it and they took us into the lighthouse.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: There were no more bodies on the sea?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: That's all.</span> <span id="s330">They picked up basically myself and two bodies.</span> <span id="s331">Afterwards I don't know what, whether they did pick up or not.</span> <span id="s332">I talked to them, but you know, it was the language barrier, they speak only Turkish and I didn't have no way of communicating with them at all.</span> <span id="s333">But them put me on a, on a, on a bed, they gave me blankets, cover me with blankets and they gave me some food.</span> <span id="s334">They gave me some cheese, bread.</span> <span id="s335">I remember onions.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: This was in the lighthouse?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: In the lighthouse, yes.</span> <span id="s338">And I lay there, probably, probably about 12, 14 hours, something like that, quite a long time.</span> <span id="s339">Until finally two policemen arrived.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: Were you frozen?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: Yes, well my legs were frozen and my hands were frozen, so I had a hard time walking or even eating, because I couldn't move my hands.</span> <span id="s342">My arms yes, but not my hands.</span> <span id="s343">So these two policemen came, they picked me up, went outside and waited for a bus.</span> <span id="s344">A bus came along, they pulled me into this bus and they took me to Istanbul.</span> <span id="s345">This was on the Asian side, so they took the bus, then we took, took me to a, a ferry and the ferry took me across to the other side and then an ambulance was waiting for me on the other side.</span> <span id="s346">The ambulance took me to the hospital, which I understand at that time was the military hospital in Istanbul.</span> <span id="s347">As I arrive, or as they pull me out of the ambulance, there were a few reporters that start asking me questions as they were taking me in.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: In which language?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: In French, in Russian, in English, which I didn't speak at that time.</span> <span id="s350">But in French they ask me, where are you coming from and what's your name?</span> <span id="s351">There was a particular reporter that I met him later on because as it happened he was locked up with me later and he spoke good French so I was able to give him my name and that I came from a vessel Shtruma(ph) and what happened to the vessel, I says, was blown up.</span> <span id="s352">And then they took me into the hospital, into a room and I was constantly with a policeman in, at the door.</span> <span id="s353">The doctor came in and they bandaged my, my hands and my feet in camphor.</span> <span id="s354">And they changed the bandage and they kept me there for about a, about a week.</span> <span id="s355">But constantly I had the policeman at the door and I didn't see anybody except the nurse and a doctor.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: So nobody from the Turkish authorities came to talk to you?</span> <span id="s357">A: No, nobody.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: Nobody from...</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: From anyplace.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: British Consulate.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: Nobody from the Jewish agency?</span> <span id="s363">A: Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: What happened next?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: Next I was already able to walk, my hands were still not okay, but I was able to walk, so they dressed me up and they took me by car to the police station in Istanbul.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: Did they give you new clothes, clothes, or?</span> <span id="s367">A: No, I was still with the same clothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: What happened at the police station?</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: At the police station they took me in their top floor of the police station where you have the, it's like a prison, you know, with the bars.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: Cells?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: Cells.</span> <span id="s372">And I was put in one of these cells and then I was taken for interrogation.</span> <span id="s373">They ask me various question, what happened, who I am and so forth, took me back to the cell.</span> <span id="s374">Then a suitcase came, they delivered me a suitcase and in the suitcase I had shoes, new clothing, new clothing, another jacket and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: Who send you this suitcase?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: The Jewish agency, actually Mr. Brod(ph), which was the head of the Jewish agency in Istanbul, he send me that.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: Did you get any sense of hostility from the Turkish authorities, from the people who interrogated you?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: Any sympathy?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: No.</span> <span id="s381">Just very cold facts, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: How many people interrogated you?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: One or two at a time, several times.</span> <span id="s384">And that was, I realized that I am in a political prison.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Why, because there were several other people in cells, about three or four.</span> <span id="s386">Couple of Germans, couple of Bulgarians and I believe also an Englishman.</span> <span id="s387">More or less from the news, newspapers.</span> <span id="s388">They were there because they were on one side or the other and they explained to me Turkey's neutral, cannot allow from one side or the other, they try to maintain neutrality.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: How long did you stay in the police station?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: About three weeks.</span> <span id="s391">Oh, the second or third day, I already receiving, I was receiving food from outside, in other words, a person was delivering me, twice a day food.</span> <span id="s392">Once in, once in the morning and once in the evening and I understand this was also from the Jewish agency, Mr. Brod(ph) told me that he arranged with a restaurant that delivered, to deliver to the police station as long as I am there.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: What happened after these three weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: After these three weeks, I was told that I am allowed to leave the station and I will be taken by Mr. Brod(ph), who will pick me up and take me to his house.</span> <span id="s395">He came, now my clothing were in the, my old clothing were in the old, in the suitcase, I came, he came, picked me up and we took a taxi, we took a taxi and took me to his home.</span> <span id="s396">There I had the chance take a bath, we had dinner, his wife was there.</span> <span id="s397">I slept very well.</span> <span id="s398">And he explained to me what I did not know, that it's a miracle that I was still alive after Shtruma(ph), because I am the only witness that can say what happened to Shtruma(ph) and then the authorities would have been very glad to make me disappear.</span> <span id="s399">Then there would be no trace of knowing what happened to the vessel.</span> <span id="s400">He says, "The fact that you managed to talk a few words at the entrance of the hospital and telling them what you, your name and where you coming from, these reporters right away published in newspaper, so it's all, was already known throughout the news media that you are one of the, you are a survivor of this particular vessel.</span> <span id="s401">And because of that, it seems that the Turkish authorities were reluctant to make you disappear, basically.</span> <span id="s402">But they kept you in their police station because they did not know how to deal with you."</span> <span id="s403">Should I continue?</span> <span id="s404">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: Mr. Stoliar, with your permission I would like to go back a little bit in time and my first question is what was your age when you embarked on Shtruma(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: 18.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: 18.</span> <span id="s410">You basically left because you wanted to leave or this was a decision of your father?</span> <span id="s411">Or both?</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: My father's decision, to get me out.</span> <span id="s413">He explained to me that things may get much worse than are now and so he said, "I'm going to do everything possible to get you out of here."</span> <span id="s414">Of course I was already coming out of this labor camp, day, day labor camp, quite exhausted and it's of, manual work there, of digging trenches and the behavior of the Romanian military was worrying me.</span> <span id="s415">They were rough.</span> <span id="s416">So naturally I conveyed this to my father, so more than ever he decided that I have to get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: Did the decision of your fiancée to leave influence you, or this was a coincidence?</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: Just a coincidence.</span> <span id="s419">They had their own problems of survival and they were worried also about their own lives and so it was just a coincidence that it happened, that they also managed to get a ticket on this vessel.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: Who was she?</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: She was a girl, born in Germany.</span> <span id="s422">The father was a Romanian and her mother was from Germany and we just got very friendly and we decided, once we managed to escape from this situation, to get married.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: Can you tell us please, what you felt when you saw the ship?</span> <span id="s424">A: My first...</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: .</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: My first reaction was, can I get out of here?</span> <span id="s427">In other words, to get out of , going on this ship, but I soon realized that it was out of the question.</span> <span id="s428">They, we were locked into this, pushing us inside and there was no way out but to leave the ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: So you considered going back to Romania before leaving?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: To get back to Bucharest, but that, that thought disappeared very quickly when I realized that the Romanians are not going to allow anybody to leave this condition.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: Could you describe to us what type of food you had during the journey to Istanbul?</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: It, each, I think each one of us brought a little bit of something that could keep us until we get so-called normal food.</span> <span id="s433">So we had a little bit of, a few cans that we were allowed to take and a few biscuits and we were supposed to get, on the ship, something to eat.</span> <span id="s434">Again, there were some dry biscuits and basically not much more.</span> <span id="s435">But they told us, as soon as we reached Istanbul we are going to get, the suppliers of the ship were going to get us food once we reached Istanbul.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: So basically you didn't receive, on the ship, any food?</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: Hardly any food.</span> <span id="s438">There was even no way of getting the food, we were just too many of us into such a small space.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: I'd like to ask you again about the sanitary conditions on the ship during the journey to Istanbul.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: During the journey to Istanbul, first of all we could hardly move, because we were told that, you know, because of so many people, if there are too many of us on the deck on one side, the, the vessel can be in danger.</span> <span id="s441">So, first of all, they wanted us to move as little as possible and also, once we are on a deck for a few hours, also to try to keep the vessel in balance by not going too much on one side or the other.</span> <span id="s442">So we were directed, some people on the left side, some people on the right side, then go slowly.</span> <span id="s443">In other words, there was a possibility that the vessel may get out of balance if we move too much.</span> <span id="s444">So the conditions were such that you just stayed in your bunker as much as you can, without, without moving.</span> <span id="s445">So there was no way of getting cleaned up or, or even, even, you barely managed to, to drink water, never mind about washing or something like that.</span> <span id="s446">And as the time went by, it was getting naturally worse and worse and worse.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: How about the sanitary conditions in Istanbul during the two months, did they improve or they got worse?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: They did not improve, but the fact that we were able to go on a deck, there we were able to get a little bit of water to wash your face, but very, very little of it and there were no facilities that you could use in order to, so you realize that you are going to stay that way until you are going to somehow leave the ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: I would ask, I would like to ask you another question about the moment of the explosion, you, you were thrown into the water, dressed, fully dressed.</span> <span id="s450">Did you get injured?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: No, I did not.</span> <span id="s452">And quite a number of people that were blown, blown into the air and landed into the water, there was, we did not, I did not see any sign of, of injured people, except that there were just swimming and yelling.</span> <span id="s453">I didn't see any injured, except that they were just trying to keep afloat.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: So let's go back to the moment when you are in the house of the representative of the Jewish agency in Istanbul.</span> <span id="s455">Did you have your papers with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: No, I had nothing.</span> <span id="s457">Mr. Brod(ph) explained to me that he would, I was taken to his, he was allowed to take me to his house because he promised that I'm going, he's going to deliver me the next morning to the railway station, to the policeman that is waiting for me, to take me on the train and so he has just that evening time to talk to me and he was, he was talking more than I was, he was a, he tried to explain to me what happened to me after I left the hospital, that he tried to get to me and they did not allow him to see me, they did not allow him, he weren't to have any kind of contact, written or otherwise, or to talk to me and it, as I said, it were, he told me that it is a total miracle that you, that you survived Shtruma(ph).</span> <span id="s458">I says, "This is a natural thing."</span> <span id="s459">What, that you survived after Shtruma(ph), this is also quite a miracle.</span> <span id="s460">So, and he said, "The papers are with the policeman, I'll take it next morning, I have to take you to the train station and the policeman will go with you all the way to the border between Turkey and Lebanon and he will release your papers at that time.</span> <span id="s461">These are paper, it's a lassez passe(ph), with permission to enter Palestine as an immigrant.</span> <span id="s462">This came from London, through the, the consulate in Istanbul, was given to me, given to the Turkish authorities and the Turkish authorities are going to release it once you leave the Turkish territory."</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: Did the Turkish authorities confiscate your passport, did they keep any papers, or your passport got lost in the...</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: No, I, my Romanian passport?</span> <span id="s465">No, still with me all the time.</span> <span id="s466">In actual fact, anything that I had on me, they did not touch it.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: They did not touch it?</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: No.</span> <span id="s469">They didn't touch it, I didn't see any, anything that they went through it, although I was, of course my, my clothing was, in the hospital I didn't have my clothing with me.</span> <span id="s470">But otherwise, everything I had on me, my Shtruma(ph) ticket, my Romanian passport, that's, that's the only thing I had, it was all the time in my jacket.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: So they gave you papers in order to be able to transit toward... A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: You, you didn't see anybody from the British consulate?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: I didn't see any, no, I didn't see any British person from any, any authority and in actual fact, even Turkish authority I haven't seen, except when I was interrogated at the police station.</span> <span id="s476">Otherwise, I had, they never give me any explanation why they keep me in prison, although I, I try not to antagonize them, but I said that, I did ask them, once they finish with the interrogation, "On what basis do you keep me in prison?"</span> <span id="s477">So they said, "Because you are illegal in Turkey, you did not have a visa for Turkey, so therefore we cannot release you."</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: I understand.</span> <span id="s479">Because we, before we go further away, I would like to ask you to tell us a few words about the main actors in terms of countries, of this tragedy, how do you feel about Turkey, how do you feel about Romania, how do you feel about Great Britain?</span> <span id="s480">I would like to know what do you think about the organizers of the trip?</span> <span id="s481">Basically, how do you see the various responsibilities and countries or organizations who are responsible for this tragedy?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: Well, let's start with the Romanian authorities.</span> <span id="s483">I understood there is a war and I understand, I understood at that time that Romania was allied to Germany, consequently they're going to behave about the same way as the Germans are.</span> <span id="s484">Killing of Jews start pretty early in Bucharest.</span> <span id="s485">At random.</span> <span id="s486">We had the iron guard, guard .</span> <span id="s487">That was, behaved the way I understood, just like the Nazi's did in Germany and to keep away from them, to make sure that they don't get you.</span> <span id="s488">They can grab you in the street or something like that.</span> <span id="s489">Of course afterwards, when I had to wear the yellow band with the star of David on it, I realized that they can pick you up, doesn't matter what you do.</span> <span id="s490">The authorities, the first time that I got in contact with the authorities was of course when I, in the train in Constanza(ph), I was pretty, they behaved like wild people.</span> <span id="s491">In the customs, they were putting in their pocket anything that they could get hands on, which at that time I considered to be absolutely barbarian, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Then, the more, then when I went to the ship and then I realized that unless we give them all our wedding rings, they are not going to do anything about it, more than ever that, we are like animals and they behaved like.</span> <span id="s493">Then in Turkey again, we just saw the Turkish police.</span> <span id="s494">They were totally unconcerned about human life, or the condition of the human life and the more we were on the vessel, the more we realized that we'll never get out of this because they couldn't care less.</span> <span id="s495">That we are human being, it doesn't matter, really.</span> <span id="s496">It's just that we are an inconvenience to them and they are going to try to correct that inconvenience.</span> <span id="s497">The fact that we were hope that maybe they'll put us in a camp in Turkey, this disappeared very quickly.</span> <span id="s498">The only time that we had a little bit of hope is when they allowed the nine people to go ashore, then we said, maybe there is a possibility something will happen.</span> <span id="s499">We were watching whether they'll allow the kids, the children to be, disembark.</span> <span id="s500">But as long as they were on the vessel we knew that nothing would happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: How many children do you think were on the ship from there?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: I would say close to 100, 150.</span> <span id="s503">Quite a lot of children because they were all families together, not only individual people.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: So basically from a number of passengers, so forth of...</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: 760, I would say that 100 were children.</span> <span id="s506">Q: Also children of low age?</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: No babies, but small children.</span> <span id="s508">Anything between six and 16.</span> <span id="s509">Q: How do you see the British responsibility in this story?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: We knew about British policy in Palestine and we expected maybe they will not allow us to land in Palestine.</span> <span id="s511">Once the vessel goes into the Mediterranean, of course it will go towards Palestine.</span> <span id="s512">We expected, possibly, to be taken somewhere else instead of Palestine, but it's a chance that it's really worthwhile taking, even if we are taken to a camp, doesn't matter where, whether it is on Cypress or anything else, it still cannot be as bad as in the condition that we were there, that we were in Romania or on the vessel.</span> <span id="s513">Once I landed in Haifa, I was taken to the CID there, police station at the border between Lebanon and at that time Palestine.</span> <span id="s514">And of course there, that was the British police, they ask me a few question, they were quite polite, they, they just wanted to know some facts about where I am coming from and they say as soon as that, you can take a car and go wherever you want to go.</span> <span id="s515">So I was not, they did not, the British authorities in Palestine did not interfere whatsoever with my movements.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: So if I understand correctly, you left by train Turkey, with a Turkish policeman?</span> <span id="s517">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: And he went by train with you where?</span> <span id="s519">A: To the Lebanese border.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: To the Lebanese...</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: The train stopped at the Lebanese border, I think it was Aleppo.</span> <span id="s522">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: And in Aleppo, the Turkish police just gave me the papers, my papers, they said, "These are yours."</span> <span id="s524">Shake hands and left.</span> <span id="s525">So a, a car was waiting for me at, at the, at the station in Aleppo.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: Who sends this car?</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: Only with the driver, that's all.</span> <span id="s528">There was nobody there but the driver.</span> <span id="s529">He approached me, said, "I am here to take you to Haifa."</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: Who sent this car?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: I don't remember, really.</span> <span id="s532">I suspect some Jewish agency from Palestine that did that and the car took me from Aleppo to the Palestine border, stopped there, went to the police station, they asked me a few questions, then the car took me to Haifa, where a friend of mine was waiting for me, Mr. Horowitz(ph), and...</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: What do you think about the responsibility of the organizers of this voyage, the people who really organized the trip?</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: The organization, really the only thing they were interested is to get as many, as much money as possible out of this thing and irregardless of life conditions or anything like it.</span> <span id="s535">Just like butchers, to take so many people into such a small space.</span> <span id="s536">My, I consider it to be criminal, because there was, if you look, afterwards, if you look at the condition of the ship, there is no way that the ship would ever, ever, even manage to get into the Mediterranean.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">With what?</span> <span id="s538">You see, it was old engine, it was cracked.</span> <span id="s539">Now, you have a cracked engine, it will be very difficult to make it work.</span> <span id="s540">And yet, it was for them, for the organizer, this was like something is very normal, that the ship had no living conditions, they considered this normal, so.</span> <span id="s541">Of course, I know, it's war time, but there is a certain limit that you can allow yourself to do things, even though it's war.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: I understood that the ship was built in 1830.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: It was, I wouldn't even call that a ship, really, it was just a, a piece of steel that they put some wood on top of it and superstructure and they thought that that would be good enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Actually I don't think the organizer even expected that this so-called vessel, will ever reach anywhere.</span> <span id="s545">But it was an excellent way of getting money.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: So, if we say that this was highly improvised, is a very mild statement?</span> <span id="s547">A: Very mild statement.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: So what happened to you next in Palestine, after reaching Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: Well, of course I, I was still had problem with my hands and my feet, they were still, my hands were still frozen and so I had the physical therapy and it was necessary and things like that.</span> <span id="s550">Then I tried to find some work.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: Did you, did you have difficulties in walking or using your hands?</span> <span id="s552">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: Any ?</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: At the beginning, my hands are still, they were still frozen, so I, I had a hard time eating, using my hand.</span> <span id="s555">And I had also hard time walking because of my feet were still stiff.</span> <span id="s556">But slowly, slowly, I start managing to get normal again and then I start looking for work in Haifa.</span> <span id="s557">So I had a few friends that helped me during this time.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: So where did you work?</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: I work as a night watchman to some, in some company parking lot.</span> <span id="s560">Then I managed to become a driver.</span> <span id="s561">As it happened to be, American mission in Palestine, that was driving a pickup.</span> <span id="s562">Then I went, I decided to go to Jerusalem from Haifa.</span> <span id="s563">There I stayed with another friend of mine.</span> <span id="s564">And then I decided to join the British army, in 1943.</span> <span id="s565">There was a lot of, there was a very strong movement at that time, in Palestine, to join the Allied Forces, so that you can contribute towards the victory against Germany.</span> <span id="s566">You know, a lot of propaganda to join.</span> <span id="s567">So I joined the British army and after training they sent me to Cairo and from Cairo I went to, as the Allied army, British army, where, after , they were advancing towards Benghazi, they Tripoli and I was with the army service corps, service corps.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Actually I was driving a tank, water tank for the troops, to give them water, so we were constantly behind the lines, supplying water to the British, New Zealand, South African.</span> <span id="s569">We're part of the eighth, Alexander's eighth army.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: Do you know English when you, you enrolled?</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A: Very little.</span> <span id="s572">Absolutely minimal.</span> <span id="s573">But while in the British army, it happened that they allocated me to 100 percent English regiment and I was the only non-English of this regiment.</span> <span id="s574">Afterwards they had the Palestine brigade and things like that, but when I joined, they didn't have that yet and I was sent into an English corps.</span> <span id="s575">So I was the only foreigner, shall we say, that did not speak English.</span> <span id="s576">They're all from England.</span> <span id="s577">So they took upon themselves to make sure that I learn English.</span> <span id="s578">So they taught me the English language, slowly, slowly, but...</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: Did you, did you encounter any forms of anti-Semitism in the British army?</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: Absolutely not.</span> <span id="s581">Never I was questioned or, about whether my religion or where I'm coming from.</span> <span id="s582">They just knew that they had to teach me English.</span> <span id="s583">Actually I would say that my stay in the British army, '43 to '46, three years, I never, never had any sense of being apart of them because I was a non-English.</span> <span id="s584">I was very well treated.</span> <span id="s585">As an equal to them, without any restrictions.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: During these three years you were practically, most of the time, in Africa?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: Right.</span> <span id="s588">From Cairo the troops were advancing towards Tunisia, all throughout North African desert and I was just there, until they took over Tripoli, then I was stationed in Tripoli and then were to, they were preparing to invade from North Africa into Sicily, so they're preparing the Sicilian landings and then just, I was nearly going over to Sicily, then the war ended, 1945.</span> <span id="s589">Then I went back to Cairo, where I stayed another one year, in Cairo headquarters of the British army.</span> <span id="s590">I was demobilized from the British army in Cairo, in '46, no '45 and then I stayed one more year as a civilian with the British army and then I went to Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: I would like, with your permission to go back to the war time, because I'd like to know what happened during the war, to your family, to your father and to your mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: My father remained in Bucharest and miraculously he survived and stayed there until I brought him to Israel.</span> <span id="s593">My mother moved to Paris when she divorced my, when they divorced.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: Before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: Before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: Before the war.</span> <span id="s598">So she was living in Paris.</span> <span id="s599">She married another person that had a, a boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">They lived in Paris.</span> <span id="s601">I left Paris in '39, one of the last trains that they managed to get through from Paris to Bucharest.</span> <span id="s602">She remained there.</span> <span id="s603">The things in Paris got pretty bad, so her husband decided to send his son and my mother south, in to the Vichy part of France, where they thought maybe it's safer there.</span> <span id="s604">So she took a train.</span> <span id="s605">He, she and the son of her husband, took a train from Paris going south.</span> <span id="s606">At the border with the Vichy part, they were told to get out of the train, all, everybody and all the Jews that they could find, that was German, German troops there, all the Jews that they could find, they took them and put them on another train, that was a cattle train and they were taken out and then she disappeared and her husband survived Paris, so I met him after the war and that's how I know.</span> <span id="s607">He, he came to visit me in Israel and he explained to me that my mother was taken off the train with his son, put in another train, they went and they landed in Auschwitz and there she was killed together with his son.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: Let's go back please to Palestine.</span> <span id="s609">So you finished your military service in 1946 in Cairo and you moved back to Palestine.</span> <span id="s610">Do you have a family already?</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s612">At the end of 1945, when I was demobilized from the British army, I met a girl in Cairo and we got married and then in '46 when I went to Palestine, I went with her.</span> <span id="s613">So we moved and we moved to Haifa.</span> <span id="s614">I lived in Haifa and I worked, found work with Esso Oil company at that time.</span> <span id="s615">They had the operations plant, fuel, so I was the superintendent of that plant, until Esso decided to pull out of Israel and then I was offered a position to go to Japan for an American company, so I took that position, went into Tokyo.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: Did you, did you go through the independence war of Israel...</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: Or you left before?</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s620">I returned in '46, very shortly afterwards the War of Independence started.</span> <span id="s621">Being an ex, I was a sergeant-major, being an ex-military person, naturally I was one of the first to be taken into the Hagenah(ph) and then the Israeli army.</span> <span id="s622">And I was on the Syrian front.</span> <span id="s623">Then there was armistice, fighting again.</span> <span id="s624">I was with the Israeli army until the war ceased.</span> <span id="s625">And was armistice, then I was demobilized, I looked for a job and joined Esso Oil company.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: So you were on the front line?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: Yes, in actual fact, I was against the Syrian army, in the north, but it was a short duration, only a few weeks, then we were pulled back.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: How come did you get an offer to work in Japan?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: Because it was an American company that was looking for people, they were, Japan was in very poor condition economically, and there was opportunity in Japan to bring in things that Japan did not have and this American company had their headquarters in Tokyo, but they had, they couldn't get people to get to Tokyo.</span> <span id="s630">So they came to Haifa, one of their executives came to Haifa, was negotiating to get a friend of mine to come for two years to Tokyo, so my friend introduced me, said, "Maybe he wants to go, too."</span> <span id="s631">So they took both of us, we signed the two year contracts and we went to Japan.</span> <span id="s632">From two years it turned out to be 18 years, but anyway, that's...</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q: Was an interesting experience for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A: Very, very, very interesting, because I was in charge of barter agreements and was quite fascinating how you can export and import goods without money going through your hands.</span> <span id="s635">That's, it's a barter.</span> <span id="s636">You give something for something else.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Q: So you stayed in Japan 18 years?</span> <span id="s638">A: 18 years, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: Can you mention to us what you consider of being the most important event in your life in Japan?</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: Well, I was able to see how a nation which is, was completely destroyed by war, slowly, slowly becoming economically so wealthy.</span> <span id="s641">I have very good living conditions in Japan.</span> <span id="s642">As far as living among Japanese, it has been excellent experience.</span> <span id="s643">I like their culture.</span> <span id="s644">I like their way of living, of more of the way they live and let live.</span> <span id="s645">Never I was discriminated, just only the difference is that I was a foreigner there, but otherwise, I was, I was very, very impressed by their attitude to the other people.</span> <span id="s646">Towards themself and foreigners.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: How did you family adapt to Japan?</span> <span id="s648">A: Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: How did your family adapt to Japan?</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: Very, very well.</span> <span id="s651">They also, of course we had in Tokyo, a Jewish community and we had friends.</span> <span id="s652">And unfortunately, after about 10 years living in Japan, my wife had a heart attack and died in Tokyo and I was left with a 10 year old boy and then after a few, a few years, I married a girl that was going through Japan, an American girl named Fashion and we got married in Portland, Oregon, because she was from Portland, her family was from Portland, so we decided to get married in Portland and then she moved to Tokyo with me, then we lived another five years in Tokyo, then we moved to Taiwan.</span> <span id="s653">We lived there another five years and then we decided to move back to her own place, which is Oregon.</span> <span id="s654">So we moved to Portland, then decided to live in .</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: Mr. Stoliar, I would ask, I would ask you, I would like to ask you another question.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Remember after South Vietnam fell, a lot of people left by boat.</span> <span id="s657">There were pirates and a lot of tragedies on the sea.</span> <span id="s658">Did this impress you, did this trigger memories?</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s660">I was visualizing all these people that running away from Vietnam, being more or less associated with our problem that we had during the war, just history repeats itself all the time.</span> <span id="s661">And not only the Vietnamese, but also the Chinese that were running from China into Hong Kong and the camps that they were put into.</span> <span id="s662">Quite vivid.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: I want to thank you very much.</span> <span id="s664">A: You welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: Mr. Stoliar, I would like to go again back to you and to ask you a few questions about your family and Shtruma(ph) voyage, from Constanza(ph) to Istanbul.</span> <span id="s666">First of all, could you tell us please what, what was the name of your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: My father's name Jacobs Stoliar(ph).</span> <span id="s668">Q: And the name of your mother, please?</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: My mother, Bella Lakeman(ph), her maiden name, then Stoliar when she married my father and then she remarried in Paris and her family name then was Tomashin(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: So she was probably deported under the name of Tomashin(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: Either Tomashin(ph) or Tomasin(ph), depends with, with an h or without, I don't know.</span> <span id="s672">And, unless she, unless she was under her maiden name, I don't know, but she was married to Tomashin(ph) and her, shall we say her stepson was also Tomashin(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: I understand.</span> <span id="s674">I'd like to kindly ask you to go back to the voyage of Shtruma(ph).</span> <span id="s675">It must be very difficult to be confined on, in such a small space with so many people.</span> <span id="s676">How did you feel?</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: At the beginning you start some kind of a desperation, you know, some kind of a feeling of, that something drastic will happen, something that, like close to death.</span> <span id="s678">And then you start trying to eliminate all the problems that are surrounding you, such as you cannot move around so you, you getting like into a cocoon and try to eliminate as much as possible what surrounds you, becoming within yourself and see whether you can survive under such conditions.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: So you didn't want to talk too much to your fellow passengers?</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: Right and also my fellow passengers, they were not talking much, either.</span> <span id="s681">It was less and less, is like each one was in a different world.</span> <span id="s682">There was very little communication towards the end, very little communication.</span> <span id="s683">It was like something was going to happen, bad and just were just waiting for these things to happen.</span> <span id="s684">It's like was, you were already in some kind of a mourning type.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: So basically there was less and less hope?</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: Less and less hope.</span> <span id="s687">Is like we felt that, we felt that we have reach the end, with no way out.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: Can we go back to the moment when you were in the water?</span> <span id="s689">More exactly, that night when you knew that you have to survive, how did you succeed in surviving?</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: I tell you honestly, even today I cannot explain why did I survive when everybody else did not and I still don't have an explanation to it.</span> <span id="s691">And because of that, in the first years after the Shtruma(ph) tragedy, as I could not explain to myself why did I survive, I felt some kind of a guilt, guilt of why am I surviving versus so many people, including the captain, including all the, all the other youngsters that were on the boat, that there were at least as good swimmers and things like that, they have not managed to survive.</span> <span id="s692">And for many years I avoided talking about it, including my wife, because I felt that really I cannot justify why I am still alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">With the time, I came to reconcile myself with the fact that just miracles do happen from time to time.</span> <span id="s694">But I have no explanation because I have nothing special while I was in water that would have kept me more alive than other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: What did you think for, during all this time, when you were in the water?</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A: First of all I was hoping that somebody, somewhere, somehow is going to hear us.</span> <span id="s697">Why us, because I had the chief officer behind me, also yelling and screaming and talking loud and things like that.</span> <span id="s698">So we were so concentrated.</span> <span id="s699">He emphasized so strongly that, "Don't fall asleep."</span> <span id="s700">He emphasized that I should be constantly, if nothing else, we just talking, so that I don't fall asleep and so we were concentrating on that and it's only later, when the, the daybreak came, that I suddenly did not feel him any more, in my back.</span> <span id="s701">I don't know how long this time has taken, but you know, it was still very, very cold and I was getting colder and colder and maybe I thought, maybe I don't feel any more, something behind me, but then, then I turned around and he was gone, he was laying down.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: Did you get during this time, really desperate?</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: No, it's when I saw him in the, dead in the water, then I got really desperate.</span> <span id="s704">If he, he was just as alive as I was and then you turn around and he's dead.</span> <span id="s705">I said to, I said to myself that that's the end.</span> <span id="s706">So at least let's try for the shore, let's try to swim for the shore.</span> <span id="s707">Then when I came back and I saw I cannot get to the shore, then I said to , "If I have to drown, I might as well kill myself before I drown."</span> <span id="s708">So, I had a knife, a pocket knife with me and I pulled it out, but I was unable to open the blade because my hands were frozen.</span> <span id="s709">So while I was struggling with that knife, suddenly I see this big vessel towards me.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Q: What did you, what did you think, what did you feel when you saw the rowboat with the Turks coming to, towards you?</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A: I feel a great relief, was finally they arrived.</span> <span id="s712">I talked to, to them a little bit, they told me that they have seen things floating in the sea, so they decided to take the boat and see what was going on there.</span> <span id="s713">But this just, this is the little thing that I could manage to understand from them.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: Did you ever have nightmares about, about... A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: This accident, did you ever...</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: I did not have any nightmares because my only guilt in all this tragedy was the fact that I could not explain to myself, why did I survive when so many did not, although so many had the opportunity to survive being in the water.</span> <span id="s717">That means they were still alive after the ship blew and yet none of them, I could not believe that I am the only one.</span> <span id="s718">There was no ex, even today I cannot explain, why only me, when so many, they were around me in the water.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">They could have survived like I survived.</span> <span id="s720">The fact of this being there eventually, all right?</span> <span id="s721">Well the chief officer had that opportunity exactly like I had and yet he did not survive either.</span> <span id="s722">And he was not an old man or, or, or a person, you know, having difficulties, he was a strong sailor, he was a sailor.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: Were you dressed perhaps in a different way?</span> <span id="s724">Let's remember that the water of the Black Sea is very cold in February, compared to the rest of the passengers?</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: Well, I had a thick jacket, that jacket was completely wet, so actually that jacket, I felt like taking it out because it was keeping me more cold than outside.</span> <span id="s726">No, I did not have anything special dressed that, that could have tell me that's why I survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: When did you, did you start to talk about this voyage?</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: I had several interviews with various news reporters.</span> <span id="s729">They, they wanted to write an article here and there about my survival and, quite a number of years has passed.</span> <span id="s730">Before Japan, I was not talking to anybody about it.</span> <span id="s731">Nobody even asked me when I was living in Haifa and then in Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s732">Nobody came to ask me about this.</span> <span id="s733">Well, I justified this by, because it was war.</span> <span id="s734">People were just, people were already, they told me, "Be happy that you are still alive, we don't know what will happen next with that war."</span> <span id="s735">So, and after the war, while in Japan, nobody, once or twice some reporter wanted to write an article about or something like that, but nothing really that, you talk to the reporter for a few hours and then that's it and then suddenly an article will appear here and there.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q: Okay, David, if you tell us what this is please?</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: First, the top is an ad that we could read, about an

and they advised that I would be allowed to take 20 kilograms of baggage with me.</span> <span id="s745">This embarkation was reduced to 10 kilograms.</span> <span id="s746">This was the official ticket that was given after my father paid for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: David, can you explain those two stamps on the left?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: Oh, these are revenue stamps.</span> <span id="s749">At that time in Romania, in order to, any official document had to have revenue stamps, to make it official.</span> <span id="s750">Romanian revenue stamps.</span></p>

people were on this vessel.</span> <span id="s755">This is the same vessel, but it shows the superstructure that was built on top of the steel structure.</span> <span id="s756">Now, when the torpedo hit the vessel, it hit below the superstructure, so the metal part went right away to the bottom and the upper part, which was all wood, was blown into pieces in the air, with all the people that were being on the, were into that structure.</span> <span id="s757">So these people that were in the superstructure, wood superstructure, were blown into the air and then they landed in the water, including myself and start swimming around.</span> <span id="s758">The bottom, the bottom of the vessel disappeared immediately.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">Q: And describe the picture, is that your
