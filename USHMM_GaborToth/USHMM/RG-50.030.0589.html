–</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: Latrobe, PA.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: Right, and I understand you grew up on a farm?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: Well, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: When I was eight years old we bought a far – my dad bought a to – a poultry farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: And that was back in 1928.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: And what was your job on the farm?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: Taking care of chickens – mostly with chickens.</span> <span id="s50">That’s what it was, a poultry farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: And we did a lot of custom hatching.</span> <span id="s53">Say like you was a farmer or something, and you had a hundred eggs from your chickens and you wanted to increase your flock.</span> <span id="s54">You brings your eggs to us, and for two and a half cents an egg, we would hatch those hundred eggs out for you.</span> <span id="s55">And then they – and if you got a hundred chicks out of it, you’d be lucky.</span> <span id="s56">But nobody ever really did get a hundred percent, because of the eggs were not always fertilized.</span> <span id="s57">The rooster wasn’t doing his duty.</span> <span id="s58">He had to do that, you know what I mean.</span> <span id="s59">So, but that’s what we did, we – we had thousands of chicks.</span> <span id="s60">We had two incubators that would hold 10,000 eggs, and we had a hatch come off every Monday and every – every Monday and Friday.</span> <span id="s61">And then we’d take these chicks out, and say like if you had – oh, we’ll say a hundred eggs, then we’d call you up and let you know th-that the chickens – the chicks, when they’d be ready.</span> <span id="s62">Then you’d come and – and get your chicks and pay us for the chicks – for – for the eggs that we hatched, or for all the eggs.</span> <span id="s63">Cause if you gave us a hundred, well you’d be – you very seldom get a full hundred percent hatch, because a lot of them – a lot of the eggs weren’t even fertilized.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: Did you enjoy it?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: Did you enjoy it?</span> <span id="s67">Did you enjoy the chicken farm?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: You did.</span> <span id="s70">Can you tell me about how and where did you meet your wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: My wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: Well, she – she – she’s dead now.</span> <span id="s74">She died about t-two years ago, and – but we were married for 58 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: How did you meet her?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: I have four – four children.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: I had four, and I lost a daughter – I lost – yeah.</span> <span id="s79">We had one daughter and three boys.</span> <span id="s80">Well, I got the three boys yet, and boy I’ll tell you, they’re – they’re – they’re wonderful.</span> <span id="s81">And any person – you know, with a lot of the people, when they get married they say, oh I’m not gonna have kids, it cost too much to raise them, and that.</span> <span id="s82">Well, boy, I’m glad I did have them, because they take good care of me.</span> <span id="s83">The one – this Jerry here, the one that ha – who you give the keys to there, he – he – he’s one of my sons.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: He’s the second son.</span> <span id="s86">And I have three altogether.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: How – how did you meet your wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: How old?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: No, how did you meet your wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: What do you mean?</span> <span id="s91">Say it again, please.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: How did you meet your wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: How did I meet her?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: Oh, she was two houses away from me.</span> <span id="s96">And her brother and I was friends.</span> <span id="s97">When they moved up there in the country, next to us you might as well say, why, him and I got together cause we were both almost the same age.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: Now, why did you go into the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: Why did I go in the army?</span> <span id="s100">Well, because they told me to, for one reason, and the other reason, I wanted to go.</span> <span id="s101">I did want in before I got married, but after I got married, then they took me.</span> <span id="s102">Cause see, I’m blind in one – in this eye, the right eye.</span> <span id="s103">When I was five years old, I – a guy that didn’t care where he threw his garbage, what do call them, you know, they got a name.</span> <span id="s104">Anyhow, it – he – he was going up an alley.</span> <span id="s105">We lived in tow – when thes – this is when we lived in town, before we bought the farm, and I was five years old then.</span> <span id="s106">And we had a fence around the – Dad had a fence around the ge – our yard, and that, and my mother always put me out there to play with my toys while she cleaned her house, when I was little.</span> <span id="s107">Well, this here guy who were – whoever it was, was drinking pop, and the – and his bottle – bottle went empty, I guess, so he just tossed it over the fence into my – into my Dad’s yard.</span> <span id="s108">And Mom always put me out in the yard, cause it was safe to play there, because it – she had a lock on the – on the gate, so I wouldn’t get out and get run over with a car, wi – which I – which I did anyhow.</span> <span id="s109">I got ran over three times in tha – to be exact.</span> <span id="s110">Each car went over me, but none of them the wheels – only one the wheels hit me.</span> <span id="s111">Anyhow – let’s see now – I wasn’t going to tell you that.</span> <span id="s112">Th-Th-The – the – so anyway, the – this time that I got hit twice right – right in front of our house, cause it was in the wintertime and we were in – in a – was in a – this – the outskirts of the town, like.</span> <span id="s113">And my two older brothers, they wanted to go across the s – Ligonier Street, that was the main street going down through Latrobe, and make us new – new fort, because they want to have a snowball battle.</span> <span id="s114">And my mother said no, you can’t go, cause if you go over there without Grant, he’s gonna go across the road and get hit with a car.</span> <span id="s115">Well, she was right there, because a-and – and my dad, my dad was an invalid ever since he was two years old, and his – he got sick, and his mother took him to the doctors and the doctors gave him the wrong medicine, and he wound up with polio, and he was crippled, and he had walked on crutches all his life from – well, in s – he was – well, I – I forgot just how old he was, he wasn’t very old.</span> <span id="s116">He was two years old, I think it was.</span> <span id="s117">And, he started out on crutches.</span> <span id="s118">He walked on them until he was 41 years old, and then – then here he got bursitis in his shoulders, and he couldn’t use his crutches no more, so he went to a wheelchair.</span> <span id="s119">And he lived in the wheelchair and – until his death, which was 36 years later.</span> <span id="s120">And – but he had a – an office job, and he worked there 45 years.</span> <span id="s121">And I told him whenever he retired, I says, but one thing about Dad, why, none of your sons are gonna work as long as you did at one job, because we were all too old for, you know, to get started on it.</span> <span id="s122">But that was my dad.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: What year did you enter the army, sir?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: The army?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: Yeah, what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: Year was – gosh, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: Do you remember your training, what – what training, army training was like?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: Yeah, we – yeah, we – we ki – we – we trained there, you know, I went to Maryland, is where – is where th-the gi – the recruits went.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: Was it difficult for you, army training?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: Difficult?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: Never.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: Never.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: I loved that stuff.</span> <span id="s135">I – I liked that, especially when we went out in the firing range, that’s what I liked the best.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: Were you a good shot?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: I became a crack shot, and that – and then, whenever we finished, when we had the Germans down and – and they gave up altogether, and the war was over in Europe, why then I volunteered to be a sniper.</span> <span id="s138">Got out up where – pretty nice ge – cause we were gonna go to Japan.</span> <span id="s139">And we were starting to train for them, whenever they dropped the atomic bomb.</span> <span id="s140">That made the difference in the whole outfit, for everybody.</span> <span id="s141">And so they – they – they canceled everything after that, and – and so when that – when they dropped that bomb, we couldn’t believe it, one bomb could do all that, because we been bombed before, being in the service.</span> <span id="s142">And, oh, they tried to kill me a good many times, but they – I always out shot them.</span> <span id="s143">Let’s put it that way.</span> <span id="s144">It’s a heck of a thing to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: Do you believe your – did your training prepare you for combat, in your –</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: It did?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: Real good.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: Can you describe the first experience of combat in your out – your –</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: Well, the first guy I shot, it made me sick, cause I – when the battle was over, I went up to see, because whenever I – he was laying behind a log, and he was shooting at me, an-and he missed me the first shot, and I ducked down behind a – a – a tree.</span> <span id="s151">Cause th-the Germans had the ri – the civilian population had to rely on the woods to keep their fires burning in the wintertime, cause there was no coal for them, or nothing to – to heat up – oh, I tell you the – the German civilians, they took a beating.</span> <span id="s152">And the – the Germans took the – all the food, mostly, that they could get, ta – and they didn’t have enough to eat half the time, and the – that’s the – that’s the civilians.</span> <span id="s153">But I’ll tell you, the German civilians were better to us than what the English were.</span> <span id="s154">And we were su-supporting the – England and everything else, and doing all that stuff.</span> <span id="s155">Cause I was in England there for nine months, I think it was.</span> <span id="s156">Anyhow, I was in the military police then, and they – so I got their bo – I got acquainted with wa – one of their bobbies, which is, that’s what they call for, you know, police, over there, a bobby.</span> <span id="s157">And him and his wife decided to have four of us come to their house for Christmas.</span> <span id="s158">Well, that was a pretty good deal, you know, at least we thought so until he – he says – well, we were – I was on like a – a – a different outs – outfit, because they – they went and they gave us the st-stamps and that, you know, for th – to get your – your vittles to eat.</span> <span id="s159">And then – then you – anyhow, he says, do you have any – any stamps, food stamps, that’s what they called them.</span> <span id="s160">And I says, yeah, I said, I got mine yesterday.</span> <span id="s161">He said, let’s see it.</span> <span id="s162">And I pulled it out and handed it to him, and that was a mistake, because he never gave it back to me.</span> <span id="s163">He says, well, if you’re coming to eat, he says, we gotta feed you.</span> <span id="s164">But I wasn’t counting on supplying the food.</span> <span id="s165">But anyhow, it was nice, and that was a good gesture.</span> <span id="s166">And so he had the four of – he had four of us come there.</span> <span id="s167">And I was telling him – his wife, she’s just a little squirt, and the – but she was nice.</span> <span id="s168">And she – and she’s asking me, you know, like, about my family and all that stuff, and I told about my wife, and that, and she says, well, I’m gonna make her a baby doll.</span> <span id="s169">I said, well, that’ll be real nice of you.</span> <span id="s170">She said, one of those days it’ll come rolling up to your house door.</span> <span id="s171">So – but it never came.</span> <span id="s172">She forgot about it, or didn’t have a chance or something.</span> <span id="s173">I don’t know, maybe something happened.</span> <span id="s174">But that was nice, and – but it didn’t last long.</span> <span id="s175">So anyhow, I – we went and – and we – we went on into – we got a kra – we went over the – over there where France was, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: When – when was that?</span> <span id="s177">When did you go to France, sir?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: I-I can’t really say now.</span> <span id="s179">I’m not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s181">That’s fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: But I was in – I was in England nine months.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: That part I do know.</span> <span id="s185">I crossed that ocean four times during the war, and when – we were lucky, we a – we always – the Germans always didn’t have a – their submarines in the right place, because we’d go across, you know, like a – a whole – whole mess of ships would go at one time, and oh man, it’d be stuf – stre – stretched out for miles.</span> <span id="s186">I saw one going down, where a torpedo, it – it missed our ship and – and hit the one farther away and – and I – and I always liked to watch – I’d go up to the bow and I’d watch the – the tor – the fish, I forget what you call them now, you know, they were big son of a guns, and something like a shark.</span> <span id="s187">Well, the sharks didn’t like them because they – they beat up on the sharks.</span> <span id="s188">The – the fish are as bad as the human beings, ain’t they?</span> <span id="s189">They fight with each other.</span> <span id="s190">And they always jumped in front of the ship.</span> <span id="s191">Always wondered how the ship kept from running over them.</span> <span id="s192">They didn’t – never – we never seen any of them getting hit.</span> <span id="s193">They’d just keep diving, you know.</span> <span id="s194">And that was interesting there.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: Your unit was instrumental in pushing the Germans back at the Rhine river, you crossed over the Rhine.</span> <span id="s196">Do you remember –</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: Do you remember that, crossing over the Rhine?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: Can you talk about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: Well, they – we – we just kept – kept fighting them, that’s all.</span> <span id="s202">And they – they finally gave in, the enemy did.</span> <span id="s203">But wha – I always remember one German lady, she come out on the – on her porch.</span> <span id="s204">We just chased the – the German soldiers out of this here one town.</span> <span id="s205">And when we were going into it, and we stopped for a – a – like a rest, why this lady come out and she says, I want 12 of you men to come in my house.</span> <span id="s206">Well, we didn’t have any idea why she want 12 us men in there.</span> <span id="s207">So 12 of us [indecipherable], we went in.</span> <span id="s208">And she sits us around the table, she goes over to her oven.</span> <span id="s209">In them days the Germans had put in all coal stoves in their kitchens.</span> <span id="s210">And she opened up the – the oven, and there’s 12 apples in there she baked, just for us guys.</span> <span id="s211">And she – she gave each one of us an apple.</span> <span id="s212">And I’ll always forget – I always remember that woman.</span> <span id="s213">I – how I wished I would have got her name and address, because she was so good to us.</span> <span id="s214">Then she took me around, I don’t know why she picked on me, but she took me around her house, showed me all around in there, her house and everything.</span> <span id="s215">And she had three sons that was in the army, German army.</span> <span id="s216">But they were all prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s217">We had one, and England had one, and the Russians had one.</span> <span id="s218">I said to her, well, I said, I’ll tell you, I says, you’re pretty sure of getting those two – two of them back out of those three, alive.</span> <span id="s219">And I says, now the one we have and the one the – the – at – let’s see what a – well, we’ll say England, and the one they have, the British, th-the – I said, the one the British have and the one we have you’re pretty sure of getting those two back.</span> <span id="s220">But, I says, the one that the Russians have, I says, I can’t tell you about them, I said, those guys are nuts.</span> <span id="s221">I said, all they want to do is kill everybody.</span> <span id="s222">And so that’s exactly what they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: Were the Germans good soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: You bet they were good soldiers.</span> <span id="s225">And when they were shooting those guns, they were dead shots, too.</span> <span id="s226">Now I had one shooting at me with a machine gun, cause we ran a – he-here’s the way it was.</span> <span id="s227">I don’t know whether you know any – you know how ya – how the army when they’re – when you’re tra – going into a battle like, well, we’re go – we’re going along, coming up – up through this field that, and someone says that – that the Germans are up ahead somewhere.</span> <span id="s228">Well, we always had scouts out, two scouts.</span> <span id="s229">They’d be about oh, say, 200 yards ahead of us.</span> <span id="s230">Now, they were not supposed to shoot any bra – any Germans that they seen, but they were supposed to give us the silent signal.</span> <span id="s231">The silent signal was a – y-you laid your rifle down, you grabbed ahold of it and – by the barrel and by the – and by the back of it, and you put it above your head and go like that.</span> <span id="s232">That is your signal that the enemy was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: An up and down movement.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: Yes, they – and they – and they didn’t make a sound.</span> <span id="s235">Well, anyhow, then wh-when we got that message, by boy they just – they blew a whistle and we just spread out and start digging in right away, because we knew we were running into a trap.</span> <span id="s236">And so the Germans, they smartened up.</span> <span id="s237">They thought by us cat – by us having those two scouts there, they were told tr – told, do not shoot the scouts.</span> <span id="s238">Th-The German did.</span> <span id="s239">He says, wait til they get through your lines, but make sure they don’t see you to give out and give the – us the – the warning.</span> <span id="s240">Says go, and – wait a minute now, I think of something about that – anyhow, he says, let them go through your ra-ranks, but make sure they don’t see you.</span> <span id="s241">And then, when they get through it, grab them, and then we’ll put them in – in prison, then, for the – you know, the – the – the ten – well, anyhow, the prison.</span> <span id="s242">And so anyway, that’s what they did, cause we lost both of our scouts at first, but we got them back after a bit, cause one of our shells went and blew the fence down, and wa – th-then they shot out of it, and they got back with us again.</span> <span id="s243">And they said that when they were – the Germans ran, he says, we ran right with them.</span> <span id="s244">He says, those shells and that you guys were shooting at us, well, they didn't give a hoot who they killed.</span> <span id="s245">So anyhow they – the scouts, we ha – we had them scouts, but whenever they give that signal, we would – we would – see, we’d be going in the single file, maybe might be three or four in a row, you know how they are when you’re marching.</span> <span id="s246">And as soon we got that signal boy, you s – just spread right out.</span> <span id="s247">And everybody got their – we had little shovels.</span> <span id="s248">You probably sm – maybe you seen them already.</span> <span id="s249">And we’d dig a foxhole and get down in under below the ground surface.</span> <span id="s250">And then that – then the – we were ready for fight then.</span> <span id="s251">But if you – if we didn’t see that signal, why we would walk right into this trap.</span> <span id="s252">Now, we ran into one of them traps, and all of a sudden they start shooting.</span> <span id="s253">And I hit the ground right where I was, you – whenever – when they start shooting, nobody has to tell you to get down and stay down, you learn that quick, because you want to live a little longer.</span> <span id="s254">So anyhow, we went and – wait a minute now.</span> <span id="s255">We – well, we – we got up there an-and then the Germans start shooting at us, and we got down and then we start shooting back.</span> <span id="s256">Well, I was out, right out in the open spaces there.</span> <span id="s257">Well, my buddy was, when he was shooting his rifle, I was reloading mine.</span> <span id="s258">And when I was shooting mine, he was reloading his.</span> <span id="s259">So we had a steady sho – stream of bullets going up where the machine gunners were.</span> <span id="s260">So anyhow, they went out and he – he turns on me.</span> <span id="s261">I was laying down on the ground shooting there, and I didn’t have no trees or nothing to get behind, I was out in the open.</span> <span id="s262">And my buddy, he – he got the only tree that was there, he – he dove behind it.</span> <span id="s263">Anyway, and the Germans saw me.</span> <span id="s264">So he turns the machine gun on me.</span> <span id="s265">Now, he [indecipherable] like, well, we’ll just – there, there.</span> <span id="s266">We’ll just say here [indecipherable] right here.</span> <span id="s267">I stretched out this way, see, and up – the Germans are up that way, and he starts shooting at me, and he come about that far away from my body.</span> <span id="s268">He dug a hole, a trench with that machine gun, from my head down to my feet, about four inches deep with those bullets.</span> <span id="s269">That’s – an-and I was laying right there, all that dirt was flying in my face and all over my body and that.</span> <span id="s270">And I was trying to crawl inside of my helmet, but I wasn’t do – doing good.</span> <span id="s271">My head was already in there.</span> <span id="s272">So I got to thinking, if I laid still, he’d think he killed me, and he’ll go and shoot somebo – at somebody else.</span> <span id="s273">So whenever he stopped – he had to stop and reload, you know, and when he’d run out of shells, why he’d take a couple of minutes for him to get the new belts i-in there of shells.</span> <span id="s274">Well, while he was doing that, I was lay – laying there figuring out what I was going to do to him.</span> <span id="s275">Anyhow, I had dirt and mud and everything in my face, and all over my body and everything else.</span> <span id="s276">The whole way down my body, I was just covered with dirt an-and m-mud, you might say.</span> <span id="s277">So anyway, I – I got a – while – while he was shooting, h-he to – he change his – his targets then.</span> <span id="s278">He looked for somebody that was – he could see, cause he saw me laying there and he figured he’d killed me, see?</span> <span id="s279">Well, that worked.</span> <span id="s280">Anyhow, he starts shooting at somebody else.</span> <span id="s281">Now, when he starts shooting at somebody else, I was the only one in the outfit that had rifle grenades.</span> <span id="s282">The captain come out to me when we – fe – before we started out that day and he says, Shultheis.</span> <span id="s283">I said, yes sir?</span> <span id="s284">He says, you’re my grenadier.</span> <span id="s285">I said, yes, sir, I said, sir.</span> <span id="s286">He says, yeah, what do you want?</span> <span id="s287">He said – I said, what’s a grenadier?</span> <span id="s288">He ha – he said, you’re the guy to stop the tanks.</span> <span id="s289">So I pulled one – I pulled out the gre-grenade, he gave me a ba – a pa – a bag like, see, I would call it a bag.</span> <span id="s290">Anyhow, it fit over your shoulder and it had six grenades in it; three of them phosphorous and three expl – high e-explosion.</span> <span id="s291">So I said to him, what am I supposed to do with these?</span> <span id="s292">He says, you’re supposed to stop the tanks.</span> <span id="s293">I picked it out and I said, sir, I said, you think that this little thing here is going to stop one of them great big tanks?</span> <span id="s294">He says, I know it will.</span> <span id="s295">I says, what do I shoot at, whenever I shoot at that tank?</span> <span id="s296">And he says, the tracks.</span> <span id="s297">Now, I never knew this before that – before that day.</span> <span id="s298">He says I – when the tracks are gone, there’s a – a little track in the center of the tank, and it – and it runs – it keeps those su – tracks on the wheels like, even, so that they don’t come off.</span> <span id="s299">And he says, all you gotta do is hit that wheel, it’s about that big, he said.</span> <span id="s300">But that’s like telling you to go jump in the lake.</span> <span id="s301">Anyhow, I said yes, sir, I says, I think we can stop them all right then, if we can – if I can hit that – if I can just hit that there part where you just told me.</span> <span id="s302">And so anyhow, he s – he – he agreed with me on it.</span> <span id="s303">So he went and let me figure it out myself.</span> <span id="s304">So – but I – I never saw a tank after that.</span> <span id="s305">S – but I did use them on – on machine guns, and boy it worked good.</span> <span id="s306">So anyway, this one whose – this machine gunner that was shooting at me, I th – I thought, if I stop jiggling around here, that th – that he’ll think he killed me, because he was pretty far away, you know.</span> <span id="s307">So, by gollies, it worked.</span> <span id="s308">I laid still and he sh – quit shooting at me.</span> <span id="s309">I guess he must have stop – must have ran out of shells and he had to put another belt on, and while he was putting that belt on, I – I – I rigged up my – my grenade launcher on my rifle, and you shoot those grenades with a blank.</span> <span id="s310">So they told me, they says, for God’s sakes, make sure you don’t have a live round in your rifle when you shoot that, because he says, if you shoot that with a live round, you’re gonna blow your own head off, whenever you would shoot that – that grenade, he says, instead of it going that way, it would stay right where it was and knock your head off.</span> <span id="s311">So th-that – that’s a good – good lesson.</span> <span id="s312">So – so I never did, I always checked it all – all the time, make sure.</span> <span id="s313">So anyway, I said to my buddy, I says, I’m gonna fix those babies now.</span> <span id="s314">And he says yeah, you know, what are you gonna do?</span> <span id="s315">I says, I’m gonna send them a phosphorous grenade.</span> <span id="s316">So I put a phosphorous grenade on cause they are – they were the worst.</span> <span id="s317">The high explosions, they were bad, but th – but the – the others, they were worse, they – oh, man, they were miserable.</span> <span id="s318">They – cause when they – when this phosphorous grenades went off, they didn’t quit burning when – if it hits you.</span> <span id="s319">Say like if a – if it hits you in – in your arm, that would burn the whole way through your arm.</span> <span id="s320">It’ll melt your – even melt your bones, they said.</span> <span id="s321">And that’s how hot it went.</span> <span id="s322">Anyway, I said to my buddy, I says, okay, I says, I’m ready to shoot, I says.</span> <span id="s323">You watch up over the top of them trees, see if you can see it going.</span> <span id="s324">And I stuck the huge – you always stick the – the stock of your rifle in the ground and raise the barrel up.</span> <span id="s325">And I was laying there beside it there, and I raised her up, and I said, you wa – I says, are you watching?</span> <span id="s326">He said yeah.</span> <span id="s327">I said, well, here it goes.</span> <span id="s328">I reached down and I pulled the trigger.</span> <span id="s329">Well, that grenade, you could see it.</span> <span id="s330">I-It goes pretty fast, but you can still see it going.</span> <span id="s331">It went – oh, it made a beautiful bow right up over the top of the trees and come down.</span> <span id="s332">And on the way down, it must have hit a – a limb, because I don’t think it went off at the ground, because it seemed like it – when the – when it disappeared and you couldn’t see it, why, it was – wasn’t enough time for it to hit the ground when it exploded.</span> <span id="s333">But when it exploded, it made a great, big puff of smoke, and flames, and – and – and it – and the phosphorous was everywhere.</span> <span id="s334">And I heard them guys screaming up there where they – where I was shooting at, so I – I – I’m pretty sure I hit them, because that was them screaming.</span> <span id="s335">Now, I never seen any of them, or anything like that, because they were pretty well camouflaged.</span> <span id="s336">Anyway, we – we – that stopped that whole [indecipherable] that whole battle.</span> <span id="s337">The Germans jumped up after I shot that, and they ran ba-backwards, back over – to get away from us.</span> <span id="s338">Our outfit, they – they got up, they ran back the other way, I ne – I never figured out yet why they went that way, cause it was a gort in the wrong direction.</span> <span id="s339">So anyway, we didn’t see no more Germans that night.</span> <span id="s340">And the me – and my buddy, he s – he’s young.</span> <span id="s341">Come on Shultheis, come on Shultheis, everybody’s leaving us.</span> <span id="s342">I said, I’m not leaving til I get my rifle reloaded.</span> <span id="s343">And I ha – I had to take all my stuff off my rifle, and that – you know, the launcher and everything, and – to get to my rifle to work right with the bullets.</span> <span id="s344">And then I put a – a c – a clip with nine rounds in it, then I was ready to go.</span> <span id="s345">Then I stood up, and when I stood up there wasn’t a soul around, just him and I.</span> <span id="s346">Our men got up, they went the one way and the Germans went the other way.</span> <span id="s347">And that’s another thing I never understood, why we went backwards instead of going forward.</span> <span id="s348">Anyway, we – we didn’t have no more problems with them that night.</span> <span id="s349">And then – then my buddy and I, we went back to where the – kind of back to where the machine gunners were and they had to stay up all night on guard, so we – we each dug a slit trench.</span> <span id="s350">Now, a slit trench, I don’t know whether you know what a slit trench is or not.</span> <span id="s351">Oh, you know?</span> <span id="s352">Okay, that’s just where you can lay down in it, it’s big enough.</span> <span id="s353">We di – we dug that, each one of us dug a bed, you might say.</span> <span id="s354">Filled full of leaves and then crawled down in under them leaves and go to sleep.</span> <span id="s355">And the – we let the – we let the machine gunners stay awake that night.</span> <span id="s356">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: Did they soldiers you served with, were they good soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: Who?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: Your – your soldiers, the ones you served with.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: Our si – our service –</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: – our soldiers were good soldiers, yes.</span> <span id="s363">And – cause they listened to what the – what they were told to do, and they did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: Do you remember the Dachau concentration camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: Did I remember what, sir?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: The concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: Yes, Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: Can you describe coming into contact with that camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: Well, it – it was a big camp.</span> <span id="s370">They – and they say it had 30,000 men and – and women in there.</span> <span id="s371">And they had a lot of people in there, that you might as well say they starved them to death, practically.</span> <span id="s372">Now, whenever we got in there, got the gate open and that, what happened, see, the f – the first guy in – in the line, he saw – he saw the lock.</span> <span id="s373">So he just pulled his rifle up and shot it.</span> <span id="s374">And when he hit it, it just flew in pieces, cause we was using armor piercing shells at the time, cause we was doing a lot of force fighting – fighting in to the – in the force – force.</span> <span id="s375">Now like – well, say – say like where they have a – make the cuckoo clocks.</span> <span id="s376">Well, that part there, we were into that, and boy I’ll tell you, no wonder they call that the Black Forest, cause it is really dark.</span> <span id="s377">The sun don’t even get down through the trees.</span> <span id="s378">Anyhow, we went – we were on there and we – and we come and – and I come to a – a – a German truck, and stand there.</span> <span id="s379">And I can see some blankets in there and I thought, oh boy, that’d be ideal thing.</span> <span id="s380">I climbed up in the truck and it was full of dead soldiers and the blood all over everything, oh what a mess.</span> <span id="s381">So I got out and let the whole bunch go.</span> <span id="s382">I let the dead keep the bla-blankets.</span> <span id="s383">But that’s just the way things went.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: Do you remember which gate you entered at Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: Well, there was one gate by – we came to was – it was more a – it was more like a – say like a front gate.</span> <span id="s386">See, there was a gate here, and then back here, they had the furnaces right here, and – and then – then they were over some more buildings here.</span> <span id="s387">And then they had other buildings where, like the prisoners stayed in, inside of that gate.</span> <span id="s388">Now, the Germans had, I would say, oh, 200 yards of field, all smooth cut.</span> <span id="s389">There wasn’t a tree [indecipherable], so that if any of their prisoners escaped, their soldiers were supposed to shoot them and kill them.</span> <span id="s390">And they – and they had a lot of time to kill them because they had that whole say – we’ll say 200 yards to – to go before they got to the woods.</span> <span id="s391">And so anyhow, I – the – we – we – I had a German in my sights that I kept in my sights there, because there was three prisoners chasing him after we opened the gates, see?</span> <span id="s392">And I said to my buddies, I says, look at that, I says, that German, he’s running away from those guys.</span> <span id="s393">And I says, he’s in A-1 shape and – and those three guys are in starvation shape, and I said, they’ll never catch him.</span> <span id="s394">And he was heading for those woods.</span> <span id="s395">So I got down on one knee, took the safety off of my rifle and – and I just got that guys – back of his head riding on the top of my front sight.</span> <span id="s396">And they said, what are you gonna do, Shultheis?</span> <span id="s397">I said, I’m gonna knock that guy off if he – if it looks like he’s gonna make to the – to those trees.</span> <span id="s398">Cause I said, once he gets into those trees, I says, he’s a free man, be an – and because he ga – he can have a – a thousand places to hide.</span> <span id="s399">And – and I says, I don’t think those guys are gonna be able to make it.</span> <span id="s400">Well, they – they were doing pretty good though, they – they were running and – and that German soldier was running, too, because they were after him.</span> <span id="s401">Anyhow, I – I noticed that the gap was getting closer, see, they were gaining on him.</span> <span id="s402">And I said to one of the guys, I says, well, I says, I guess I won’t have to shoot him after all.</span> <span id="s403">I says, I think they’re gonna make it.</span> <span id="s404">So they – here they caught him before he got to the trees.</span> <span id="s405">Now, if I – if I thought he was going to make it to the trees, I was going to shoot him, because he – he probably did a lot of things to those guys, and it didn’t matter to me; he was a German, so that’s – he was – there was no limit on him.</span> <span id="s406">You could shoot as many as you want to.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: What did the prisoners do when they caught up with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: Oh, the – well, they grabbed him.</span> <span id="s409">That’s one thing they did do.</span> <span id="s410">One guy grabbed one arm, and the other guy – another guy, he grabbed the other arm, and the third one, he took the pistol from the German and shot him in the head.</span> <span id="s411">That was the end.</span> <span id="s412">That German, he was screaming his head off.</span> <span id="s413">And then all of a sudden you heard the bang.</span> <span id="s414">Then I saw the head drop down whenever he shot him.</span> <span id="s415">Now, they were – well, the he – they were pretty close to the woods.</span> <span id="s416">He come pretty close to have me help him, but I didn’t have to.</span> <span id="s417">They did a good job themself.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: When you first entered the camp, what did you think you were seeing?</span> <span id="s419">Did you know what the camp was?</span> <span id="s420">Did you know wha – why – what its purpose was?</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: Well, we weren’t quite sure what the camp name was, or anything like that.</span> <span id="s422">It just happened to be in the la – in our line of fire as we – as we went – marched along.</span> <span id="s423">Cause we just go up one mountain and down another one.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: What did you f – what did – when – what did you think when you first saw the prisoners, when you entered th-the – the – the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: I couldn’t believe anyone could be so rotten.</span> <span id="s426">That’s what I thought.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: Did you communicate with any of the prisoners, did you talk to anyone?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: Well, no, we didn’t get a chance to, cause we were always dra – always after the Germans – soldiers, and na – and – and we – we – what we wanted to do, we wanted to keep them moving so they didn't have time to dig in and put a row of machine guns across our path.</span> <span id="s429">Na – so what they did, they went and they gave their men orders to make sure they hide good, and camouflage themselves and everything, so the – the – so that our – our two men that was in the lead, didn’t see them.</span> <span id="s430">And when he get to the other side of the Germans, grab them, and then put them in the concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: So what – you were actually fighting the Germans while inside the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: And did you – how long did that last, how long did that battle last?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: Not very long, cause we went straight through, cause we were – we were chasing the Germans at the time, and then we wanted to keep them from pa – getting – getting a – a trap set for.</span> <span id="s435">But we still – we ran into one of them.</span> <span id="s436">And that was a – the one where I was just telling you about where he almost shot me.</span> <span id="s437">And so – but he didn’t – he didn't hit me.</span> <span id="s438">That was the main thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: Did any of the Germans attempt to surrender to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: No, they fought right to the end.</span> <span id="s443">They were – they were good fighters, I’ll tell you that.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: Did you look around the camp?</span> <span id="s445">Did you just actually see any of the barracks or the crematoria?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: Well, we – what we could see, wa – you couldn’t see too much at first, because it was like boarded off like, you know, say like the dead, and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s447">Now, they had a big pile of dead laying in there.</span> <span id="s448">We saw tha – I saw that.</span> <span id="s449">But we no more than got into the gate, I’d say oh, I don’t know how far in we got, not very far.</span> <span id="s450">But when you come through the gate, then you saw the furnaces.</span> <span id="s451">And then – an-and – and the – the dead was piled up a pile, right out there in the ground, just laying on top of each other.</span> <span id="s452">And what they were doing, they were taking them and they was putting them in the fire and burning them.</span> <span id="s453">But I guess it made a terrible smell, because they said that the – the German population was complaining, because it stunk so bad, you know, from the – the bodies being cooked.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: How long were you inside the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: How long was I what?</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: Inside the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: Oh, about maybe 15 minutes at the most.</span> <span id="s458">Because see we – like I said, we were chasing the Germans so that – and at the time and we didn’t want them to like make – have time to dig in trenches and that for their machine guns and that.</span> <span id="s459">And so we didn’t stay.</span> <span id="s460">So we were – we were brought out right away.</span> <span id="s461">Probably some of them didn’t even get in there, some of the men.</span> <span id="s462">But –</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: Can you describe how you came across that key?</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s465">I was – I was going int – into the – into the n – n – around the fence way, you know, in – into the camp, we’ll call it.</span> <span id="s466">And here I happened to look down and I saw this key laying there.</span> <span id="s467">And th-the people coming out of – out, was running right across it.</span> <span id="s468">And – and the G.I.s that was going into the camp walked over top of it too.</span> <span id="s469">Now, I was in a couple times in fra – like – well, let’s see, where they – where they had the – had the shoe mines and stuff, they had [indecipherable] mine – [coughs] Excuse me.</span> <span id="s470">And the Germans were great for that there – having mine fields for us to walk onto.</span> <span id="s471">Only once that I got real, real close to losing a foot.</span> <span id="s472">But the lieutenant saved my hide.</span> <span id="s473">He – he was right behind me and here he happened to look down and he saw I was gonna just step on one.</span> <span id="s474">And all he did [indecipherable] he says, Shultheis, he says, stop immediately, he said [indecipherable] he said, stop, he says, a mine on – a mine there.</span> <span id="s475">And a – and I was coming down with my foot and I froze right there, I never went another inch.</span> <span id="s476">And I looked down and there was a mine.</span> <span id="s477">If it wasn’t for him, I would have a wooden leg now.</span> <span id="s478">He saved my li – my hide there.</span> <span id="s479">And the first – first one – time, why we were going, we had our – we started at three o’clock in the morning, it was pitch dark.</span> <span id="s480">We got out of our foxholes and the captain says, now, you’re – you’re to bring back – we’re gonna – to bring back some Germans alive.</span> <span id="s481">And he – and he says, for God’s sakes, and a few other words that you’re not supposed to say, and he says, don’t shoot them all, he says, we want to – we want to question them.</span> <span id="s482">He says, we’re gonna – we’re gonna g-go – we’re gonna go after them about right, and he says, we want to know what we’re gonna run into.</span> <span id="s483">So, anyhow, I – tha-that’s – that’s how that one went.</span> <span id="s484">Anyway, we – we went across the field then, and – and the – the one scout stepped on a mine.</span> <span id="s485">Now, he was about, I’d say two – maybe a hundred yards ahead of us.</span> <span id="s486">Well, we didn’t know what happened, we just heard the explosion, so we stopped, and the lieutenant s-scattered us guys around – around this place where – where that noise come from, and you hear – what it was was one of the – the scouts.</span> <span id="s487">Anyhow, I said to him, I said, sir, I said, I’ll go in there and I’ll get that guy, and I’ll bring him out.</span> <span id="s488">He said okay, but he says, wait a minute til we get you a medic, he says, you’re gonna need it.</span> <span id="s489">I said, all right.</span> <span id="s490">So he told his sergeant what to tell his men.</span> <span id="s491">The sergeant went over, he told the first guy, sa – medics wanted up front.</span> <span id="s492">And they passed it down the line, like the guy behind him and you know, like that.</span> <span id="s493">And then I took a few minutes and – and the medic come up.</span> <span id="s494">So the medic come out when I told him.</span> <span id="s495">I said, th – one of the scouts has some – he went haywire in here, I says.</span> <span id="s496">We don’t know exactly what it is yet, and the lieutenant told me to wait til you got up here because I’m going in after him and bring him out.</span> <span id="s497">And he says, okay, he says, let’s go.</span> <span id="s498">So I says, all right.</span> <span id="s499">So we went in and there – and I found him right away, he was laying by a bush, and he had one leg – one foot off.</span> <span id="s500">That’s what those shoe mine were for.</span> <span id="s501">The Germans discovered it take at least four guys to get a – a wounded guy back to the rear, and that’s four li – guys less shooting at hi – at his men.</span> <span id="s502">So, anyhow, we got the – th-the medic bandaged his – his stump up, and we got him up on his one good foot.</span> <span id="s503">And I had the – I had his arm around th – my neck and – and the medic had th – had a o – the other around and the – and we just ready to start out and he says, I could carry him better if I was on your side, he says, do you want to trade?</span> <span id="s504">I says sure, I says, I can carry him no matter which side.</span> <span id="s505">So – so anyhow, we chi – we swi – switched.</span> <span id="s506">I took his arm off my neck, I went over and got his other arm, put it around my neck, the medic come on around.</span> <span id="s507">He puts his – put the other arm – his other arm around his neck, and na – and I says, are you ready to go?</span> <span id="s508">And he says yeah.</span> <span id="s509">So the medic says, all right, let’s go.</span> <span id="s510">Well, he took one step and he blew his foot off.</span> <span id="s511">Right where I was standing, I don’t know how I missed it.</span> <span id="s512">I never even seen th – a mine there.</span> <span id="s513">And he’s the only guy of all of them that I saw wounded that cried up – up front, on the line.</span> <span id="s514">And here, when he went in – when they sent him home after they got his artificial foot and that, why, he drank himself to death.</span> <span id="s515">And he – and his mother says that he couldn’t stand being crippled.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: Getting back to the – to the – the camp, and the concentration camp, so you continued to pursue the Germans out of the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: And did you come into contact with any of the surrounding population around the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: Well, we – we never had no – n-no trouble like that, see?</span> <span id="s520">Most of it was, they were in like fields and stuff like that, and woods.</span> <span id="s521">And there weren’t too much house to house fighting, we didn’t do much of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: What wa – wha-what is your most vivid memory of the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: Well, I guess it was that – I guess it was just the part – well, I – I’ll tell you the – the – my most memory of that is, is whenever they were shooting at us, and – and if you didn’t shoot back, why you’d – you’d wind up in the graveyard.</span> <span id="s524">And I had an M-1 rifle they gave me, that was a wonderful gun.</span> <span id="s525">Boy oh boy, when you put a sight on that, why he was a goner.</span> <span id="s526">Now I had chances of shooting more than what I did, but I captured them mostly, and I turned them over to the officer in charge.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: What did the prisoners do?</span> <span id="s528">Did they – did they attempt to escape the camp itself when you entered, or did they stay where they were inside the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: The prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: Yes, the prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: Th-They – they were – they – they would say – they were ha – they had an stationary, and the – and they always somehow, I don’t know just how, they put the – put these men in there.</span> <span id="s532">Cause actually I really never seen them put them in, they – they – they gi – prisoners were standing there and then they – they went over to make sure he didn’t have no weapons on him.</span> <span id="s533">And so – now, I captured quite a few Germans.</span> <span id="s534">I captured six at a time, three different times by myself.</span> <span id="s535">And so anyhow, th – I – I – I never had any trouble with any of them that I captured.</span> <span id="s536">And they – they – now, I went into a place – well, here we – they said to us this – one day the captain come on, he says, well, you guys is go-gonna get a ride today.</span> <span id="s537">And – and it was darn near getting dark, and – and we – we were – we were gonna get a ride to – anyhow, he says, I want 12 men on every tank.</span> <span id="s538">So that’s – we had to ride on the other side of the tank.</span> <span id="s539">We rode all night long, never stopped once.</span> <span id="s540">And oh man, we were about froze.</span> <span id="s541">It was snowing and blowing and that.</span> <span id="s542">So we stopped at daybreak and we were in a wide open field.</span> <span id="s543">It was all – like it was big, big gl – hay field, see?</span> <span id="s544">And there was been – been mowed.</span> <span id="s545">So – so then we stopped, the guys bailed off of that tank and ran to a woods which was about approximately a hundred yards away to get wood to build a fire.</span> <span id="s546">Everybody else was – you know, we – we were darn near froze to death.</span> <span id="s547">So anyhow, I heard him tell the sergeant, just look at them guys.</span> <span id="s548">Every one of them, he says, go over there and heading for them woods and they left their weapons here on the ga – on the tank.</span> <span id="s549">[coughs] Excuse me.</span> <span id="s550">And so I thought, oh well, if they can all go in there, I says, I think I’ll go, too.</span> <span id="s551">So I slid down off the tank and – but only I took my rifle with me, they didn’t, cause they wanted to have their arms free to carry wood back to make a fire.</span> <span id="s552">So I go over there and here I get into the woods and the – and the Germans had trenches dug the whole way along that [indecipherable] there.</span> <span id="s553">Oh, it must have been a mile long, pretty near.</span> <span id="s554">And – and that – and the – and the ditches, the trenches weren’t real deep, but deep enough what they could lay down in it and you wouldn’t be able to hit – see – even see them, let alone shoot them.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: And so anyhow, here they moved out the night before, or we would have been in hot water right there.</span> <span id="s557">So, I got over there near these guys running around like Indians, like a bunch of nuts gathering wood.</span> <span id="s558">They took it all back and t-t-t – to the tank and made a fire.</span> <span id="s559">Well, I see a shanty in there.</span> <span id="s560">I – oh, I’ll be darned, I think I’ll go see what’s in that.</span> <span id="s561">I went over and I opened the door and I went in.</span> <span id="s562">Here was a tool shed, like shovel, pick and rake and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s563">And so I went out and shut the door and [indecipherable] there was three loaves of homemade bread and German bread there on a shelf.</span> <span id="s564">Well, I didn’t bother them, but I thought about eating one of them.</span> <span id="s565">And I walked around the – around the building, there’s another door.</span> <span id="s566">I opened up and I walked in and holy man I couldn’t believe my eyes.</span> <span id="s567">Six Germans in there in bed, all sound asleep.</span> <span id="s568">I went around – let’s see, how’d I do that?</span> <span id="s569">Oh, I went around, I put my hands under each one of their pillows to see if they had any weapons in there, like a pistol or a dagger or something like that, because I was out numbered six to one right there, and they could have killed me real easy.</span> <span id="s570">So anyway, there was nothing.</span> <span id="s571">So then I went around again, and I took the top blanket and pulled it down to their ankle.</span> <span id="s572">They never opened their eyes, they just sit up in bed, got all that blanket, pulled it back down and – and laid back down again.</span> <span id="s573">I said, well alright you guys, you don’t want to wake up, well, I’ll wake you up.</span> <span id="s574">So I reached in my pocket and I pulled out a phosphorous hand grenade.</span> <span id="s575">I pulled the pin out of it and I held the lever down on – I don’t know whether you know anything about grenades.</span> <span id="s576">Oh, you do?</span> <span id="s577">You know how you hold it down?</span> <span id="s578">Well, I was hanging onto it.</span> <span id="s579">I had my hand in the coal stove, they had a coal stove there, like a potbelly stove.</span> <span id="s580">And what I was gonna do is drop that grenade in there and beat it out of that darn sh-shed.</span> <span id="s581">And all of a sudden I heard, all right Shultheis, what in the hell are you gonna do now?</span> <span id="s582">I says, oh, here is my sergeant, he come looking for me.</span> <span id="s583">So I said, these guys won’t wake up, I said, I’m ga – I’m just gonna wake them up, that’s all.</span> <span id="s584">He says, well, what are you doing with your hand in the stove?</span> <span id="s585">Well, there was no fire in the stove, it was out, so I s – told him about it and I says, I got a hand grenade here and I got the pin pulled out and I – and you’re in my route, get the heck out of that doorway, because I said, I got nine seconds to g – from the time I let go of that grenade, before it goes off.</span> <span id="s586">And I want to be out of here and get into one of those trenches out there before it explodes.</span> <span id="s587">And so here, in our talking, one – one of them Germans woke up.</span> <span id="s588">He’s sitting up there in the top f – top bunk, his legs hanging down, he’s rubbing his eyes, you know.</span> <span id="s589">And I walk over to him.</span> <span id="s590">And he never seen me and he had his – both hands up there, rubbing his eyes there, getting the cobwebs out of them, I guess.</span> <span id="s591">And when he opened – took his hands down, he’s looking right down the barrel of my rifle.</span> <span id="s592">I says, all right, I says, the war’s over for you guys.</span> <span id="s593">I said, get the ba – get them out of that beds.</span> <span id="s594">He said one word, brrp, they all just jumped right out of bed so quick and they all landed in the middle of the floor.</span> <span id="s595">There they are, all standing there with their long-johns on and a pair of socks, that’s all they had on.</span> <span id="s596">I says, as of right now, you are all prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s597">And here, in the meantime, my tanks th – they were getting ready to take off, they – I heard the motors starting up out there.</span> <span id="s598">They w – they’d sit there for awhile to you know, get them warmed up.</span> <span id="s599">And I said to them, shake it up, and get your clothes on fast, I said, the tanks are getting ready to pull out and I don’t feel like walking any more.</span> <span id="s600">So, I said, I’m going outside, and you come out when you get dressed.</span> <span id="s601">But, I said, don’t hesitate, shake it out.</span> <span id="s602">So they got – th-th-they – they were – they oper – they c-cooperated pretty good.</span> <span id="s603">They come out and as each one would come out I would, you know, shake them down and see if I could feel any pistols or knives on them and that and none of them had any on.</span> <span id="s604">And I – and I showed them the tank that I was on.</span> <span id="s605">I says, now, I says, that’s – that’s the – the one I want to go on, that’s the one I belong to.</span> <span id="s606">Either head for that th – tha – for – for that there Lanair(ph).</span> <span id="s607">And they said okay, so I said, all right, four [indecipherable] dudes, they got into a part, and so I had the six of them there.</span> <span id="s608">And the one says, there are three loaves of homemade bread in there, can I go get them?</span> <span id="s609">I says, no.</span> <span id="s610">I says, we don’t have time to get them.</span> <span id="s611">I said, you hear them motors running down there?</span> <span id="s612">I said, them tanks are ready to take off.</span> <span id="s613">And I said, they’re not gonna wait for me.</span> <span id="s614">But when I brought them out, and they saw me coming out of the woods with six prisoners, they s – they slowed their motors down and waited.</span> <span id="s615">And I took them over and I gave them to the – gave them to the lieutenant there at our tank, and that was the last I ever seen them, so I don’t know how they made out, or what they did with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: Going back to the – the camps, sir, you said you were in there for 15 minutes?</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: Were you fighting the entire time, and if so, what was the intensity of the fight?</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: No, I – there was nothing there to shoot at, the Germans were – they – they – they weren't – they weren't in the camp or nothing when they got – when we got there.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: When they knew we were coming they moved out to another place, that I don’t know for sure now whether we ran into them or not, because we was always running into a bunch of them somewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: Did you take any photographs when you were inside of the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: Did you take any photographs when you were inside the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: Well, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s626">They – th-they – they – they – they – I don’t think it was any inside of the camp whenever we were there.</span> <span id="s627">On-Only maybe the guards and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s628">But we didn’t even see the guards, I don’t know where in heck they disappeared to.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: How were the prisoners behaving?</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: Well, they were pretty weak, for one thing.</span> <span id="s631">And they were – they were – they cooperated and they’d tell us where anybody was, and all that stuff.</span> <span id="s632">They showed us how they had to sleep on bare boards and that, they didn’t have no blankets, and heck, it was wintertime.</span> <span id="s633">Gee whiz, they must have froze to death trying to sleep together.</span> <span id="s634">They – th-that’s the – that’s the way it was, they – they had a hard life.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Q: And they were speaking to you in English?</span></p> <p><span id="s636">A: Yes, at – that’s what a – that’s what amazed me.</span> <span id="s637">Those Germans, they could speak English as good as we could, yeah.</span> <span id="s638">They must – I guess they have a – have a – all that in school, and that.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: Was there ever a time that you – that you felt threatened by any of the prisoners, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: No, I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s642">And did your – did you – did your unit call for medical assistance for the prisoners?</span> <span id="s643">Did you get food and provisions into them, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: Me-Medicine, and that?</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: Yes, exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: No, we – I – I don’t know whether they did it after we pulled out or not, but we di – we didn’t stop for that.</span> <span id="s647">But our – our job was to keep them running so they didn’t get a chance to dig in.</span> <span id="s648">Now, this one, where I was telling you about how they were shooting at me that time, well, that was one of them, one of the places we caught up to them.</span> <span id="s649">But there, what they did, they captured our – our s-scouts and th-then they found out that the w-wa – from them, I guess, what wa-was behind them, which was us.</span> <span id="s650">[coughs] Excuse me.</span> <span id="s651">And – but we – we managed pretty good, I thought – [break] that, you know, is down, I’m telling you.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: Boy, you’re gonna have a lot to sa – listen to.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: Indeed.</span> <span id="s655">When – were you in Europe on V-E day, at the end of the war in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: Well, I-I imagine I wa – wa – oh yeah, I was over in – I was in England, cause that’s where I got ba – that’s where I got into the infantry.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: See, I wanted to be in the infantry anyhow, and they – so they put me in with the 42nd Rainbow division.</span> <span id="s659">And – and if you were over there, maybe even – maybe you was even in that.</span> <span id="s660">Was you in the Ra-Rainbow division, or weren’t you?</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: Now, where – how did you hear that the war was over?</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: Oh, the – oh, the – when they dropped the bomb.</span> <span id="s663">That’s when the – cause I was – I was going to school then, over there, cause that – the wa – the war was already over there.</span> <span id="s664">The Germans told me when the war was over, but I blame near shot the guys, cause I figure he was a German and that he’s the guy to shoot.</span> <span id="s665">So, I started to hear these trucks coming down through the fields and that with the headlights on, and it was – it was daylight.</span> <span id="s666">Anyhow, I thought, who in the – we – we couldn’t understand because we didn’t get wind of any war being over.</span> <span id="s667">The Germans were the ones that told us the war was over.</span> <span id="s668">Anyhow, this –</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: Were they German soldiers who told you, or civilians who told you the war was over?</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: Soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: The soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: As they were retreating, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s674">A: They – they were coming down, they were coming back from the front lines theirselves and they’re coming right into – into our section where we were at.</span> <span id="s675">And I blame near s-start shooting at them, because after all, they were my – my enemies.</span> <span id="s676">And – and this one – and this one soldier said to me, he was sitting in the back of the truck, he says, didn’t you hear the news?</span> <span id="s677">I said no, what news?</span> <span id="s678">He says, the war is over.</span> <span id="s679">I says, it is?</span> <span id="s680">I said, nobody told me about it.</span> <span id="s681">He – that’s how I found out, from the Germans, that the war was over.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: How did you feel?</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: Pretty darn good.</span> <span id="s684">I was still alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: How long did it take before you were shipped home?</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: Not very long, I’d say – well, maybe a week, two weeks at the most.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: And did you go immediately back to Latrobe?</span> <span id="s688">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: Tell me about seeing your wife for the first time.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: Oh, that, that was – that was heaven.</span> <span id="s691">I – I was up at the [indecipherable] that’s where they bought me, when I got off the ship.</span> <span id="s692">We got on the ship when – and I – and darn if I didn’t get seasick on the dumb thing.</span> <span id="s693">And I crossed that ocean four times.</span> <span id="s694">An – anyhow, we ca – I come and I got on the train, and the train conductor, I said to him, does this train stop in Latrobe?</span> <span id="s695">He says no.</span> <span id="s696">I said, well where does it stop at?</span> <span id="s697">Pittsburgh.</span> <span id="s698">Well, I said, Pittsburgh, I said, it’s just as far as – I was in Johnstown at this time.</span> <span id="s699">An-And he told me, you know, that he stopped at Johnstown and the next stop was Pittsburgh.</span> <span id="s700">And I said, I don’t want to get off at Pittsburgh.</span> <span id="s701">Well, he says, that’s tough luck, he says, the train doesn’t co – stop anywhere else.</span> <span id="s702">So what I did, I – I hitchhiked home.</span> <span id="s703">And here I – first there was a – a young couple, they brought their bro – the girl’s brother, I think it was, back.</span> <span id="s704">He was going back into the service again, he was out on furlough.</span> <span id="s705">And this was in Johnstown.</span> <span id="s706">So then I – so that the – when my train come then, why, I asked the conductor, I said, th-this – does this train stop in Latrobe?</span> <span id="s707">He says no.</span> <span id="s708">I said, well, where does it stop at?</span> <span id="s709">He says Pittsburgh.</span> <span id="s710">I said, well heck, that’s too far away.</span> <span id="s711">I said, that’s about as far as I am now, and – cause Johnstown and Pittsburgh about the same distance.</span> <span id="s712">So anyhow, instead of going – coming home on the train, I hitchhiked a ride.</span> <span id="s713">And this young couple that brought her brother back to – to leave on the train there in Johnstown, why they picked me up and they took me so far, and then I was stuck, I was out on the highway there, and there was – there was snow, and the blowing, and I was about freezing to death, and anyhow, I-I was standing there thumbing, you know, and here comes a trailer truck with a bighearted guy behind the wheel.</span> <span id="s714">He stopped.</span> <span id="s715">He said, how far you going there Joe?</span> <span id="s716">And I says Latrobe.</span> <span id="s717">He says, hop in, he says, I’m going past there practically, he says.</span> <span id="s718">So I jumped in there and – and – and we stopped at one place there and he got coffee and that – and I called my wife up, it was after – after midnight then.</span> <span id="s719">I said, I’m getting closer [indecipherable] I said, I’m co – I’m a-coming.</span> <span id="s720">So then yeah, I says, he’s gonna let me off here at – you know when you get to – on the highway out there where it comes to Latrobe.</span> <span id="s721">And I says, y – he said he’d let me off there.</span> <span id="s722">And I said, we’ll be there in a little while, I says, he stopped to get a cup of coffee, and I says, then – and then we’ll be on our way.</span> <span id="s723">Well, he di – he lets me off at – right at the crossroads there, and when he pulled out, here comes a – the old Ford out with my wife in it.</span> <span id="s724">My wife and two of her aunts and her brother, and he was driving the car.</span> <span id="s725">I’ll always remember him, he says, you sure you got the right guy?</span> <span id="s726">So anyhow, that was our – my trip home.</span> <span id="s727">Then I went down to my – my dad’s place to see my mother and dad, and that was al-almost three o’clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s728">And then Mom says to me, she says, [indecipherable] here, you take my bed, you and Jenny take my bed and I’ll go sleep with Dad.</span> <span id="s729">So that’s what – that’s the way we did then, for that night.</span> <span id="s730">Boy, it – it was wonderful being home, I’ll tell you.</span> <span id="s731">She come a-running – she come running out of the car and she met me the halfway on – on the – on the highway.</span> <span id="s732">We were standing out there necking and it’s a wonder we didn’t get run over.</span> <span id="s733">But it was – it was something though, to see her again.</span> <span id="s734">I said, see, I told you I was going to g – make it home.</span> <span id="s735">But I had quite a few times – I even had an airplane shooting at me.</span> <span id="s736">He – he – he was strafing our – our outfit.</span> <span id="s737">We were co – we were in a convoy, and then – and again I was up riding on the tank.</span> <span id="s738">We did a lot of tank riding.</span> <span id="s739">And here he comes down the line, and at first – we were – first saw him, why the one guy says, ah look, here come one of our fighter planes.</span> <span id="s740">Well just about the time we looked, he opened up both guns on his plane, you know, he had one on each wing.</span> <span id="s741">And – well, there is only one wing, it was only one wing on them, I think.</span> <span id="s742">Anyhow, on the side of propeller was a machine gun.</span> <span id="s743">Now, when we saw the bu – the tracers coming out of that – out of those wings, we knew that he was not our friend at all.</span> <span id="s744">So anyway, I went and I put a – a – a rifle grenade on my rifle.</span> <span id="s745">I hurry up and got that on and got it all ready for him.</span> <span id="s746">I was ga – because heck, he was only about as high as the ceiling here.</span> <span id="s747">And so he’s coming down, he was shoo – he – he did some damage and he killed a few guys, but – but he missed me.</span> <span id="s748">Anyhow, the guys all jumped off that tank but me.</span> <span id="s749">I stayed on and I – me and the – and the machine gunner.</span> <span id="s750">I wanted to see that machine gunner bring that plane down.</span> <span id="s751">Heck, he was only that high, I was – couldn’t see how he could possibly miss it.</span> <span id="s752">So, we could see his bullets going – going down, you know, and when they were – when he was shooting at – at all the rest, you know, as he’s coming down the line.</span> <span id="s753">So anyhow, I – let’s see now.</span> <span id="s754">Oh, I’m already with the grenade, that’s it.</span> <span id="s755">So I got it ready for him and I had the safety off of my rifle, and I had it to my shoulder, and I had that – had the play up – taken up on the – on the trigger.</span> <span id="s756">All I had to do is just put a little bit of pressure on it and it would have went off.</span> <span id="s757">So, when I s – looked at him, and I says, heck sakes, this here – this grenade is supposed to cover a 50 foot diameter, you know, like a circle.</span> <span id="s758">And I said, if I hit him, I’m going to blow my own head off.</span> <span id="s759">I said, that’s not going to be any good.</span> <span id="s760">So I didn’t shoot.</span> <span id="s761">But I was going down there and – down there because a-another plane come right behind him, and the guys start shooting at him.</span> <span id="s762">And here he – he pulled his plane up so you could see the bottom of his wings, where he had our insignia on it.</span> <span id="s763">And th-the American insignia was a flag.</span> <span id="s764">And so then they, course, they stopped shooting at him.</span> <span id="s765">So then I watched him and when he come down a piece, went a piece, why I – I don’t know how that German knew that guy but – that guy was behind him – but anyway, he climbed for altitude.</span> <span id="s766">Now he went up, I would say, approximately a thousand feet.</span> <span id="s767">Now ma – I’m not – might be a way off, but anyhow, when he made a circle, well the – the other di – guy who made a circle, the German, so did our man right behind him, when he circled.</span> <span id="s768">And he ga-gave two bursts out o-of his – his – his – our man did, at the German plane.</span> <span id="s769">Well, he hit him both times, and when he hit him, I was watching him and the – the – when he shot first, why all of a sudden – the plane was going like this – all of a sudden the nose dropped down, and – and the plane was going down, it was heading towards the ground then.</span> <span id="s770">So th – our plane didn’t shoot no more after.</span> <span id="s771">But the farther down he come, the more smoke come out of that plane.</span> <span id="s772">And then finally it hit the ground and it exploded.</span> <span id="s773">Well, I watched that plane the whole way down and when it exploded, but it – th-the – the driver, he-he never made it out.</span> <span id="s774">And he was only a young fella too, because when he come down and passed there at one time, I saw him sitting in there with both thumbs on the – on the triggers, when he was shooting at me.</span> <span id="s775">And I thought, if I stand still, he’ll miss me.</span> <span id="s776">Well, I had the bullets coming both sides of me.</span> <span id="s777">Well, the one – the one side, he got pretty close at getting me on that one, because I was leaning against the – the duffle bags of the – of the g-g – G.I.s in the – in the tank.</span> <span id="s778">They had them strapped to the [indecipherable] o-on the – on the outside of their tank.</span> <span id="s779">And two bullets went though that – that there tank I wa – or that sleeping bag that I was leaning on.</span> <span id="s780">But I didn’t know that until after he was gone.</span> <span id="s781">So he missed me again.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">Q: When you returned home, did you talk to any of your family about your experiences in the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s783">A: About being in the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s786">They got tired listening to me.</span> <span id="s787">They were just glad I was home.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Q: What did you do after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s789">A: I went back to working on the – on the farm for my dad.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Q: And how long did you do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s791">A: Well, I – I also worked on a farm too.</span> <span id="s792">And I got a farm second day I was home, and – milking cows and stuff like that, because I liked farming.</span> <span id="s793">The only thing was the pay, and – and then the – when the war was over, why the prices started climbing, you know, and so I – my wife and I talked it over, we thought it’s time I got a raise.</span> <span id="s794">I was making a hundred dollars a month, and I got my house included in it.</span> <span id="s795">So I went to the farmer – farmer that I was working for, and I says, how about a raise?</span> <span id="s796">I says, the price of living’s going higher, and my family was getting bigger now, I – cause I had – I had two – two children right in a row, one right after the other practically.</span> <span id="s797">And I – and I had a daughter and a – and a son.</span> <span id="s798">And so, course I made extra – the expenses.</span> <span id="s799">He says, oh, you just had to tell me Jenny is – that was my wife’s name – she’ll have to live within her means.</span> <span id="s800">Oh boy, did she blow up when I told her that.</span> <span id="s801">That didn’t – that didn’t the – hit right.</span> <span id="s802">So anyhow, I looked around, I started looking around, and I’ve si – and I found a – a guy owned a horse farm, a Mr. Steiner, Steiner was his name, and I went to see him.</span> <span id="s803">Oh, he says, how much do you want paid?</span> <span id="s804">Well, I was making a hundred and – hundred and five dollars a month before, and I says 200 dollars a month.</span> <span id="s805">He says all right, and he took it.</span> <span id="s806">So I was – I worked with him then for oh, a good while.</span> <span id="s807">And – but so then here, after we – after we lived there, we lived in – right on the farm, the horse farm, we had about 40 horses.</span> <span id="s808">And he had good horses there, well – well bred stock.</span> <span id="s809">And so I went and – well, he – he went and he – he wanted my wife to do a lot of stuff for nothing.</span> <span id="s810">And he was a millionaire himself, the bugger.</span> <span id="s811">So anyhow, you’d – she – she – sh-sh – it wa – it wa – it was out of this world.</span> <span id="s812">She wasn’t able to do that because she was taking care of like – say like me and my – my – well, my – my sister – my daughter and son.</span> <span id="s813">I had a daughter and a son then.</span> <span id="s814">So then they – they were – they were – they were born, a-and whenever – whenever we got the job – well, I got the job, and so I was working, I was taking care of these horses.</span> <span id="s815">We had about 40 horses altogether.</span> <span id="s816">And I liked that job, it was pretty nice.</span> <span id="s817">But the only thing is, he wanted her to do a lot of extra work.</span> <span id="s818">Now, he was used to having fellas there that had foreign women for wives.</span> <span id="s819">They went in and they did all that work for nothing, and that’s what he wanted, see?</span> <span id="s820">And I said to him one day, I said, Mr. Steiner, I said, I’m the one that applied for the job, not my wife.</span> <span id="s821">I said, she got – she got the house to take care of and two kids – we had two kids now, we had a girl and a boy, and – or a boy and a girl, I should say.</span> <span id="s822">And – and I says, she got two kids and a house to – and a house to take care of and me, and I said, that’s enough for one woman.</span> <span id="s823">So then, here she – here she got all worked up over some stuff or something, and she wound up at a hospital.</span> <span id="s824">Well, while she was in the hospital, which was about three weeks, he didn’t allow me off the farm to go see her.</span> <span id="s825">And that didn’t go down very good.</span> <span id="s826">So – and she come home, she’s mad as a wet hen and – and so I says, well, I couldn’t help it, I said, that’s – that’s what he – he wouldn’t let me go, and I says, and I had to have a job.</span> <span id="s827">So then, one day I come in – well, we got it all straightened out with him then, about that.</span> <span id="s828">And then one day I come in the house and she’s sitting there in her pa – kitchen crying.</span> <span id="s829">I said, what’s the matter honey?</span> <span id="s830">Oh, Mr. Steiner is here – was here.</span> <span id="s831">I go, what in the heck did he want now?</span> <span id="s832">She says, he says, well, I got you at least doing some – some things.</span> <span id="s833">He wanted her to milk the – we had two cows.</span> <span id="s834">He wanted her to milk the cows, strain the milk; we had a cream separator.</span> <span id="s835">Churn – churn the cream into butter and we – we – we would get a – I think two pound of butter a week for doing that, that was going to be our pay.</span> <span id="s836">And – and I says, doggone him anyhow.</span> <span id="s837">I says – I says, I’m gonna quit.</span> <span id="s838">I says, the Russians haven’t taken over yet.</span> <span id="s839">So – so I – I quit.</span> <span id="s840">And he – oh, he said when I told him that next morning, I said Mr. Steiner, I got bad news for you today.</span> <span id="s841">And I think this was on Thursday.</span> <span id="s842">I says, Saturday is my last day working here.</span> <span id="s843">He says, I kind of figured you do something like that.</span> <span id="s844">And I said, well, I says, I gotta look out for my wife.</span> <span id="s845">And I says, she’s not that healthy.</span> <span id="s846">So anyhow, he says – all he said was, see that you have your furniture on the truck by dinnertime on Saturday.</span> <span id="s847">And on Saturday we had a – our furniture on this truck and no place to put it.</span> <span id="s848">So – so then her aunt, she was living in a – a red brick house on top of the hill by sing – Saint Xavier’s.</span> <span id="s849">Do you rig – do you know where Saint Xavier’s is?</span> <span id="s850">Oh, well anyhow, it’s on the other side of Latrobe up on – up on the highway.</span> <span id="s851">Well, it was, it burnt down there, they had a fire and they cli – that took care of that.</span> <span id="s852">So anyway, why – we go – we got out of that jo – well, anyway, well, what I did, my dad and mother’s neighbor, he worked at Latrobe Steel.</span> <span id="s853">And I called him up.</span> <span id="s854">And I knew him and I told him who it was and I says, how’s the chance of getting a job down Latrobe Steel?</span> <span id="s855">And he says, pretty good.</span> <span id="s856">And he says, I gotta go to Pittsburgh tomorrow, but he says, before I go down – go, I’ll get the ball rolling, and you call me at six o’clock tomorrow night.</span> <span id="s857">Then I says, all right.</span> <span id="s858">So at six o’clock the next night I called him and he says, where do you want to go to work, it’s all set up for you.</span> <span id="s859">I says – I says, well, when’s the next time that I can – when can I start?</span> <span id="s860">And he says, how about Monday?</span> <span id="s861">I said, good deal, because this is – I think this was Saturday whene – I called him.</span> <span id="s862">A-Anyway, I went.</span> <span id="s863">So I w – I went there on Monday and – and th-that’s when I started, and I worked there 35 years.</span> <span id="s864">I became a ham – a hammer driver.</span> <span id="s865">And we – boy, I’ll tell you, I couldn’t believe I made money so easy.</span> <span id="s866">Yeah, you know.</span> <span id="s867">So, th-they – the first job I had the – was shoveling a – a load of gravel, spreading it out.</span> <span id="s868">Another guy and I, we went down and down and we got them shovels and we had this big pile of gravel there and we st – we s-spread it all out for a roadway there where – where it was they were making, and all we did was sit around the rest of the day waiting for someone to come out and get us.</span> <span id="s869">And they paid us for it.</span> <span id="s870">I couldn’t believe it the – it was that way.</span> <span id="s871">So then that’s when I was wishing I’d started when I come home from work – from the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q: Looking back on your war experiences, did it change how you felt about Germany or Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Q: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s875">A: What about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: How di – did it cha – did your experiences in the war change how you felt about Germans or Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: Yeah, I think in a way it did.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s879">A: Well, I found out that y-you didn’t get everything for nothing, you had to work, too, you know.</span> <span id="s880">And – and th – I – and I really enjoyed working at Latrobe still, especially when I become a hammer driver [indecipherable] and a lot of the times th-the driver wouldn't feel like going to work or something, he’d take off.</span> <span id="s881">Well, that meant th-there’d be an o-opening for another driver for that shift.</span> <span id="s882">And boy, I did a lot of overtime, get time and a half for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">Q: Later on –</span></p> <p><span id="s884">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s885">Q: – you would watch your son Jerry –</span></p> <p><span id="s886">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q: – go off to Vietnam.</span> <span id="s888">Given your own wartime experiences, how did you feel about Jerry going to Vietnam?</span></p> <p><span id="s889">A: Well, he-he – he seemed to like it okay.</span> <span id="s890">H-He – he be – he was a Marine.</span> <span id="s891">That’s the one that’s here now, Jerry.</span> <span id="s892">And he was a Marine and – and course we ha-had to make fun of him being a Marine.</span> <span id="s893">And he s – I said, guess what the – what the guys in – in the army call the Marines?</span> <span id="s894">And he says [indecipherable] and I says, it’s worse than that.</span> <span id="s895">I forget now just what we did call them now, but we used to say that – that they – they always were looking for a fight.</span> <span id="s896">And then ti – so I said to him, he – he has a little dog his wife bought, and oh he’s a – a little house dog, he’s only about that – so long.</span> <span id="s897">And the little bugger, he’s always wanting to pick a fight with somebody.</span> <span id="s898">I always tell my son, I says, this darn dog of yours got Marine in him.</span> <span id="s899">He says, how do you figure that?</span> <span id="s900">I says, he always wants to have a fight.</span> <span id="s901">I said, he don’t care how big the dog is, he’s gonna fight with him anyhow.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Q: And did you talk to Jerry about your war experiences before he went to Vietnam?</span></p> <p><span id="s903">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s904">Yeah, we had – we talked about that, but he – he’s the only one in the family that went oh – no-none of the other boys went.</span> <span id="s905">And then I had a brother, he was a – Dick.</span> <span id="s906">He was in World War II like I was.</span> <span id="s907">He – he be – he was a – a machine gunner, and he got smacked in the head once with a bullet exploded th-th – that the pilot was shooting at him when he was going on a mission.</span> <span id="s908">And – and he was a [indecipherable] gunner is what he was.</span> <span id="s909">Anyhow, the bullet missed him and it hit the ceiling beside him, ba – right in back of him, and smacked him in the back of the head.</span> <span id="s910">And as a result, he lost the sight in this eye.</span> <span id="s911">Him and I got the same sight, only different his eye – I lost mine from my own dumbness.</span> <span id="s912">When I was five years old, I broke this here pop bottle with a hammer and as a result, why they took 35 pieces of glass out of my eye, and par – and part of the pupil.</span> <span id="s913">And that left me with a 15/200 vision.</span> <span id="s914">Well, that’s no vision at all, and so – yeah, I – I w – I would – I would s – be driving along, if I was in a straight stretch or something, I would shut the one eye, leave that – leave that one open, see, and I couldn’t even see the road with the darn thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">Q: We’re recording this interview.</span> <span id="s916">What would you most like future generations to know about your wartime experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A: That I’d want people to know?</span></p> <p><span id="s918">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">A: Well, I guess it’s – I don’t know, I – it was all exciting, you know, especially, you know, when the shooting started.</span> <span id="s920">And I used to write home to my wife and if it would be raining or something, and I’d be out there in a foxhole, I’d tell her, well honey, I got running water in my house today.</span> <span id="s921">Yeah.</span> <span id="s922">So, I betcha – I imagine she was pretty well worked up.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">Q: Was the war worth fighting?</span></p> <p><span id="s924">A: Was the what?</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: Was the war worth fighting?</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: I think it was.</span> <span id="s927">Yeah, I really do.</span> <span id="s928">Of course, it’s not so good shooting one another.</span> <span id="s929">But I used to think when I was over there, now here I am up here in the – in – let’s say like the front lines, I’m shooting a lot of these guys and I says, I never seen those fellas before in my life.</span> <span id="s930">I said, he never done nothing to me, nothing like that.</span> <span id="s931">So why I’m out there trying to kill them, you know?</span> <span id="s932">And then about that time they would shoo – take a shot at me and it darn near hit me, then so I start shooting back.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q: All right sir, thank you very much for your interview, thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s935">You wa –</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Q: Thank you for –</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: You mean you’re all over?</span></p>
