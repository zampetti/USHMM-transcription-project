Today is March 29, 1992, I am Anthony DiOrio and I am at the home of Mr. Gerald Grossman, Bayside, New York.</span> <span id="s5">I am here on behalf of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum to interview Mr. Grossman about his experiences during the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s6">Good morning, Mr. Grossman.</span></p> <p><span id="s7">A: Good morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s8">Q: Perhaps we could begin by your telling us when you were born and where you were born.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">A: I was born in Rovno, Poland at the time, it’s part of the Ukraine, December 20, 1923.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">Q: When it was part of Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s11">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Q: Could you tell us about your parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A: My parents were of Jewish religion and my father was born in 1900, worked as a tailor all his life, my mother was a housewife and was born in 1902 in Rovno.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q: And how many brothers and sisters did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: I had three brothers, excuse me, and a sister.</span> <span id="s16">We were five children all told</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: Were you the oldest?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: I was the oldest of the five.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: What was it like growing up in Rovno?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: Well, I thought it was O.K..</span> <span id="s21">As a child I went to school and my father worked always very hard.</span> <span id="s22">Sometimes day and night to support the whole family because he was the only one working in the family to provide.</span> <span id="s23">My life was, I would say, normal, according to the circumstances in that particular town during the Polish occupation.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: For example, your father as a tailor, did he have his own shop?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: Well, at certain times he did have a shop for himself but most of the time he worked in a small town which is eight kilometers from the city of Rovno, it’s called Abarrov (?)</span> <span id="s26">and he worked there as a custom tailor for the people of commerce that lived in that town and he was always hired by them by the week to work and he used to move into their homes while he was sewing for the whole family.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: And was he originally from that town?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: No, he was from Rovno but he used to go away for the whole week and come back to the house on Friday nights for the weekend, like for Shabbat.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: How did he come and go?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: Most of the time he would walk the eight kilometers to come home or he used to take a train.</span> <span id="s31">That was only about twenty minute’s ride by train.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: You mentioned going to school.</span> <span id="s33">What kind of school did you go to?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: I went to all kinds of schools.</span> <span id="s35">As a child, and I can give you exactly the, before I went to public school, I must have been six, five or six, I used to go to Cheder.</span> <span id="s36">Like to a rabbi to learn Yiddish.</span> <span id="s37">I used to go to a small Talmud Torah also before, and then I went to public school, which was compulsory at the time, when I was seven years old, in Polish public schools.</span> <span id="s38">And after I finished, I went to a special school, specialized school sponsored by ORT, American ORT, for three years to learn how to become an inspector for tailors which was only about twenty boys.</span> <span id="s39">Specialized for the Polish government to spread them all over Poland to become inspectors.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: Is this what you wanted to be?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s42">Each tailor that opened up a shop had to have a diploma, a master’s diploma, before he could open up and he had to get it from this kind of inspectors to see if they are good tailors or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: So, conceivably you may have become your father’s inspector?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: My father would have been probably too old by then.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: So you went to Cheder until you were 12 or 13?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: No, I went to Cheder in the evenings after school and the rest of the time I spent in public school.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: Until what age did you finish public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: 1936 and then I switched over to that specialized school, ORT, which happened to be that we were supposed to graduate just 100 days before the war started.</span> <span id="s49">No, the 100 days before graduation the war started and that interrupted the whole thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: And this was in 1939?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: 1939, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: So that was a public government school as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: It was, no, it was a private school sponsored by ORT.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: The government didn’t subsidize it?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: Your brothers and sister, did they follow you in going to public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: Well, my, yes.</span> <span id="s58">My second brother and third brother were going to public schools and the little ones were not of school age yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: What languages were spoken at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: In my house we spoke Yiddish.</span> <span id="s61">Outside we spoke Ukrainian and Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: How were relations between Jews and non-Jews in Rovno?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: Well, the city of Rovno itself there was, I would say, eighty-five to ninety percent Jewish and so we used the Polish language and Yiddish and we had very little to do with other nationalities except school where we used to get together.</span> <span id="s64">There was anti-Semitism but we were used to it and that was part of life, sorta.</span> <span id="s65">So we accepted it as it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: Do you recall any specific instances of anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: Well, yes, there was plenty.</span> <span id="s68">I, myself, before the war, my looks are not, typical sort of Jewish.</span> <span id="s69">I have blue eyes and not a typical.</span> <span id="s70">I used to be able to walk on the other side where the church was standing, the Polish church.</span> <span id="s71">It was called Koschua (?)</span> <span id="s72">in Rovno where I observed and read the literature put out in front of the church against the Jews and anything that was possible to print and make hatred.</span> <span id="s73">So I used to relay this information to others because it was a little dangerous to walk on the other side of the street.</span> <span id="s74">And that’s the only kind of a thing.</span> <span id="s75">I came across, myself, before the war, certain episodes like, when I used to walk to visit my father in Abarrov.</span> <span id="s76">I had to pass a little section where only Polish people live and as I was walking some youngsters would attack Jewish guys.</span> <span id="s77">The episode was that as I was walking on the street, one was screaming in Polish, “Der is Yid, der is Yid_______.</span> <span id="s78">That means, “is a Jew, catch him.”</span> <span id="s79">When the other friend of his came and said are you a Jew, I said where, where is the Jew?</span> <span id="s80">And somehow because of that asking the question where is the Jew, he was puzzled.</span> <span id="s81">He didn’t know I was Jewish and he let me go.</span> <span id="s82">This is the kind of things as youngsters we knew.</span> <span id="s83">There was anti-Semitism.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: Were any of your brothers accosted in similar ways?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: No, my brothers they were younger and they didn’t do out of the house that much.</span> <span id="s86">They didn’t travel outside the city of Rovno so they didn’t have any experiences like that, except going to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: How about your teachers at public school and private school?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: Well, I personally didn’t have any problems with teachers.</span> <span id="s89">The only thing I did have a problem was because I was Jewish, they transferred me from the school that was next to my house to two kilometers further, which was Degrabnik all the way in the back of the town.</span> <span id="s90">I had to walk every day to go to school, two kilometers each way, yet there was a school next door to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: Did you live in the center of Rovno?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: Was it a Jewish neighborhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: How about relations between your father and his customers?</span> <span id="s96">Earlier you mentioned that he provided customized tailoring for farmers and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s98">He had good relations with them.</span> <span id="s99">There was no problem at that time, among the Ukrainian people, and my father that worked for them.</span> <span id="s100">He used to stay in their houses, they treated him like their own.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: When he walked, he wasn’t approached the way that you were approached?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: You mentioned that school wasn’t the big problem, but I am just wondering whether after the 1935, after 1936 with the death of Pilsudski, whether you saw any changes either in the school, or in the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s105">Right after the death of Pilsudski, which the Jewish people liked, there was another Marshall, I think his name was Rydz-Smigly and his government looks like change.</span> <span id="s106">Because as a youngster I realized that we had a lot of trouble.</span> <span id="s107">The first thing, I think that the government was infiltrated with German people and they made new laws, especially for the Jews.</span> <span id="s108">Where they made them eat non-kosher foods, they didn’t allow them to kill like the Jewish way of kosher, and I think the woman was called Madame Priestaroba that was in charge of all this business.</span> <span id="s109">Just to give the Jews a little problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: Did this affect you in anyway in school, for example?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: Personally, in school it didn’t affect us but I remember there was a lot of problems among the Jews for that problem about Kashrut.</span> <span id="s112">They didn’t eat meat because they wouldn’t eat non-kosher meat.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: Did these changes affect your father in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: I couldn’t tell at the time, I was too young to understand.</span> <span id="s115">All I knew there was no kosher food for a long time and there was a strike against the government and the Jews didn’t eat any meat.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: Were you a good student?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: Fairly good student.</span> <span id="s118">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: Did you pay any attention to politics?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: Somewhat.</span> <span id="s121">I did not get into it although I had a friend whose father was a communist and was in jail for five years for communism and he was a good friend of mine and we used to talk about other ways of life.</span> <span id="s122">I was only studying this but I didn’t belong to this kind of group at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: What was the political orientation of your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: Well, mainly Zionist orientated.</span> <span id="s125">Talking about Israel all the time.</span> <span id="s126">Judaism.</span> <span id="s127">We had organizations, Zionist organizations all kinds.</span> <span id="s128">There was_______________ there was Agudas Yisroel, there was a lot of different Zionist organizations and I belonged to some of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: Which ones did you belong to?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: I belonged to once Agudas Yisroel, which is the religious Zionist organization, I also belonged to a Socialist sort of organization, I also belonged to a Socialist sort of organization like______________.</span> <span id="s131">So I used to walk from one place to the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: Did anybody in your family, extended family go to Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: One of my cousins, which is my father’s sister’s son, left for Israel in 1935 and he just recently died in Israel.</span> <span id="s134">He was one of the first Halutzim they called them, that volunteered to go to build Israel.</span> <span id="s135">It was in 1935 and I met him for the first time after the war in 1968.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: Do you recall any discussions during these years about Hitler and the Nazis in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s138">When Hitler took over, I think it was in 1933, after that on the radio people used to get together and listen to the speeches and all the propaganda they used to put out against Jews and other things.</span> <span id="s139">I remember as a child, as a youngster, that people were very upset.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: Did you recall your father speaking about Hitler and Nazism?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: My most of the time was out of the house, which I told you before, and we didn’t have a chance to talk politics with my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: How about your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: My mother did not get involved with politics.</span> <span id="s144">She was a plain ordinary housewife taking care of her children and times were not good, economic times were pretty bad before the war and she did not get involved in politics.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: Did you live in an apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: We lived in an apartment, yes, we didn’t have our own house.</span> <span id="s147">The house that my mother had when she got married, my grandmother came back from the United States and sold the house and made them move out because one of her brothers had to go to Argentina and they needed the money and that was it for the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: So you had family members who had been to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: Was there any thought of leaving Poland, or Rovno, at any point for economic reasons or for other reasons?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: No.</span> <span id="s152">There was no thought.</span> <span id="s153">We didn’t have the means to move out and the family was too big and, I guess, that was the aim to stay in Rovno.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: Did you know, in describing the differences between Jews and non-Jews, any differences between the Poles and the Ukrainians in the way in which they were treated you or treated each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: No.</span> <span id="s156">We didn’t have, I personally as I said before, we used to walk to that village Abarrov where my father used to work and we had very good relations with the Ukrainian people.</span> <span id="s157">We never heard any anti-Semitic things against the Jews, and I used to have friends that used to play with Ukrainians.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: Did you have Ukrainian friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: Did you also have Polish friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: Yes, we had Polish friends in school.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: When the war begins did it come as a complete surprise?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: No.</span> <span id="s164">It didn’t come as a complete surprise because, as I said, the propaganda and the talk on the radio and all the preparation that the Polish government made before the war like digging, in Polish they call it____________ ditches against bombs, places to hide.</span> <span id="s165">It was prepared before September 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: How much before?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: I would say about a year.</span> <span id="s168">Everyplace in Rovno we dug ditches to hide against bomb, shelters.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: From Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: From Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: So the German attack was expected?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: It was expected, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: And how about the Soviet Union?</span> <span id="s174">What was expected of the Soviet Union?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: Well the Soviet Union was not expected.</span> <span id="s176">That was a surprise.</span> <span id="s177">That was called a blitzkrieg, sort of, against the Russians.</span> <span id="s178">That’s what happened in 1941, June the 22, 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: The German attack on the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s180">I mean the Soviet Union marching in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: Oh, excuse me.</span> <span id="s182">The Soviet Union, that was a surprise, yes.</span> <span id="s183">The Soviet Union the way we know made an agreement with Germany to split Poland in half.</span> <span id="s184">I guess the river Bulg was the borderline where they had the border, Poland was divided at the Bulg.</span> <span id="s185">My part of the territory fell into the Russian side.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: Did you see any Russian soldiers in 1939?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: Just Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: Just Russians.</span> <span id="s189">At the time that the Russians came in, I was in that town of Abarro because we thought we had a lot of friends in that town.</span> <span id="s190">In order to hide from the war.</span> <span id="s191">My father took the whole family to that town of Abarro.</span> <span id="s192">And some of the families took us in…</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: Ukrainian families?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: Ukrainian families took us in and when the Russians were approaching the Ukrainians were not so happy about that.</span> <span id="s195">They would have rather had the Germans come in than the Russians.</span> <span id="s196">Somehow I assume that the relations between the communist Russians and the Ukrainians were not so good and they were afraid for the Russians.</span> <span id="s197">And as the Russians came in they asked us to leave their house and go back to our house which we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: The Ukrainians asked you to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: `Yes, the Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s200">They didn’t want to keep us.</span> <span id="s201">So the whole family was walking from that town, eight kilometers, already with some Polish soldiers that gave themselves up to the Russian military, and we also walked back and as we came to the city of Rovno, there was a guard checking everyone who came back into the town.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: Did they give you any trouble?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: No.</span> <span id="s204">They just looked at us, checked us out and see, they wanted to see if we are not bourgeois capitalist, and they let us in.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: So they decided you were not bourgeois?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: That’s right, thy decided that we didn’t look like bourgeois.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: So your father was afraid that his family would be in danger.</span> <span id="s208">Was he afraid that there would be bombings?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: Yes, they were afraid that there may be bombings or maybe attacks on Jews, so he was safer in that little town with his friends that he knew all the time than he was in the city of Rovno.</span> <span id="s210">That’s why he took the whole family out.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: Was there any destruction or attacks on Jews in Rovno?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: Not at the time when the Russians occupied.</span> <span id="s213">The Russians just walked in the city of Rovno.</span> <span id="s214">They were attacked by the Polish army and by the Polish police in the city of Rovno.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: Who was attacked?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: The Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: So there was Polish resistance?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: There was Polish resistance in both parts of the main streets of _____________ it was called at the time in Rovno, I remember there was a military church where they were hiding, the Polish police was hiding and as the Russian soldiers with their equipment were coming in they were shooting at them from behind the buildings and some of them got killed and then they killed all the police that were shooting at them.</span> <span id="s219">Because the next day, as I walked out, when the Russians were there already, I walked out and I saw a lot of them killed, police lying on the ground.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: How did you feel when you saw this?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: Well, I didn’t feel so good to see that people, it was not an interesting sight.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: Seeing the Russians come in and take over from the Poles, is this something to their credit?</span> <span id="s223">`</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: Well, for us as, I would consider ourselves poor family, the Russian people that came into Rovno was better for us.</span> <span id="s225">We accepted them, the whole city was not so bad off when the Russians were there because of the city wasn’t that rich and for my personal family, it was good.</span> <span id="s226">The economic times got better for us as a poor family.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: So the Russian occupation was not necessarily a bad thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: No, it wasn’t bad in comparison to the Polish government.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: Were there any changes in particular under Russian rule?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: Yes, all the rules changed.</span> <span id="s231">There was a change in the system.</span> <span id="s232">It was a communist system and everything, they had propaganda and telling all the people that it’s a very good system and they’ll like it and it’s going to be better for everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: How about walking back and forth, the eight kilometers, that your father walked so often.</span> <span id="s234">Was that safer or less dangerous?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: It was not dangerous because most of the Polish army that was walking on that same road with us, were giving themselves up to the Russian people.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: How about the Ukrainian farmers that your father knew so well, did they lose their farms or suffer in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: In the beginning they still kept their farms but, I understand that later on they had to give up their farms to the Russian government and work with them as co-hosts whatever they established at that point.</span> <span id="s238">But personally when the Russians came in I was going to school and then I transferred to a Russian controlled school where they taught us Russian language and continued education.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: So you had been going to that private school to become an inspector, you went to a different school under the Russians?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: Yes, that was not necessary anymore because the Russian government didn’t have the same system as the Polish government so I gave up the whole education that I had for that purpose.</span> <span id="s241">I went to a Russian public school for a short time, and after awhile I read an announcement that they are looking for students for a specialized school and I signed up.</span> <span id="s242">This specialized school had to do with railroad working, on the railroad, which was located in Zdolbuniv, twelve kilometers from the city of Rovno.</span> <span id="s243">The school was very nicely organized, we had dormitories where we stayed all the time and we were learning Russian and also specialty in locomotive work, locomotive engineering, building cars, railroad cars, and after that to work on the railroad.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: So you were preparing to be a machinist?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: Yes, I graduated to become a locomotive engineer, driving a locomotive which I liked very much, and after I graduated they sent me to a place to work, which was called Kamionka Strumiłowa located about twenty five kilometers from Lubov, the city of Lubov.</span> <span id="s246">It was also located on the German border, very close t the German new border, which was in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: When did you graduate?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: I graduated in 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: And that’s when you went to the city?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: That’s when I went to work.</span> <span id="s251">A few months maybe three or four months before the war started.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: Meanwhile your family.</span> <span id="s253">Now you separated several hundred miles.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: Now, I separated for about 200 to, I would say about 300 kilometers from the city of Rovno, and I was already on my own just in touch by writing letters and that’s all.</span> <span id="s255">I was already grown up at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: How was your family doing during these years?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: My family, my father was still working as a tailor and there was not much different than it was before.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: Your brothers and sister were growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: My brothers and sister were growing up and I was not in touch with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: You don’t remember anything special happening to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: During the time that I was gone, nothing especially happened to my family, they were growing up and I was there until the war started.</span> <span id="s262">.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: Were you thinking of getting married?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">S: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: Just trying to get your first real job?</span> <span id="s266">.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: Just getting myself established.</span> <span id="s268">I always wanted to grow up, my aim was to grow up and to help my family.</span> <span id="s269">Because I was the oldest one and I saw how much they were suffering economically, I felt that with the education that I got I would be able to help them, and that was on my mind at all times.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: Who was paying when you went to the private school and then to the Russian school, who was paying for your education?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: I was always sponsored.</span> <span id="s272">My parents did not have the means to pay for my education, so I was sponsored by the ORT organization.</span> <span id="s273">Then when the Russians came in there was no charge.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: So you were here in Lobov when the Germans invaded the Soviet Union?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: Yes, I was in___________ and that’s when the real business started, right there.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: What did you see?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: On June, would you like to tell me the whole episode?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A:” Sure.</span> <span id="s279">One June the 22nd, early in the morning about 4 o’clock in the morning, being that I was on the border and working on the railroad at that particular town_________, in the morning I saw airplanes overhead fighting with Russian airplanes.</span> <span id="s280">That was the start of the war.</span> <span id="s281">Already I saw one airplane shot down by the German airplanes and that pilot landed not far from us.</span> <span id="s282">He parachuted out.</span> <span id="s283">I saw the Germans were flying around him while he was being parachuted and they were shooting at him flying down.</span> <span id="s284">They made a few holes in the parachute, but they didn’t get him and he safely landed.</span> <span id="s285">That’s how we knew that something was going on between the Germans and the Russians.</span> <span id="s286">At 12 0’clock that day, the, Molotov at the time, announced that there was war and attack on Russia and there was war between Russia and Germany.</span> <span id="s287">The first few hours while I was there, the railroad lines between___________and Lutzk was cut.</span> <span id="s288">So, we already were paralyzed on the railroad because the Germans bombarded the railroad and no trains were coming into our station.</span> <span id="s289">My chief of the station knew about that, that we were paralyzed.</span> <span id="s290">He was upset, he had his whole family, he was a Russian.</span> <span id="s291">He was the chief of that station, and I worked under his command.</span> <span id="s292">And, he said to me that you stay over here I will take my family with the children and take them out to the city of Lubov.</span> <span id="s293">I saw that there was no reason for me to stay at the station because there was no communication and there was no connection between the stations already, because we were cut off, and I was upset about staying all by myself in that station.</span> <span id="s294">I knew the Germans were close by, so I said why do I have to stay here, there is nothing to do anyway now, why won’t I go with you and help you to evacuate your family to Lubov and then we will together come back to the station to work.</span> <span id="s295">Well, he agreed and it was my luck, we camouflaged, it was the only locomotive left on the station.</span> <span id="s296">We camouflaged one of the cars traveling to Lubov.</span> <span id="s297">We never made it back, because the Germans occupied that part and from there on we did not stop in Lubov, but we got connected to another transport and we traveled towards the Russian territory in the east, by train, and we had, I remember, a open platform train, where old cars were open like platforms and we took that train and we traveled to Rovno which took us a couple of days.</span> <span id="s298">I would say about three days to travel from Lubov to Rovno because of the bombardments from the air by the Germans.</span> <span id="s299">Every time we heard airplanes we had to stop the trains, run off to the sides, hide because they were shooting, they were flying very low and shooting at us with the automatic machine guns from the airplanes.</span> <span id="s300">When they were gone, we continued until I came to__________where I was still assigned to the railroad and this_________, which I mentioned before was twelve kilometers from Rovno.</span> <span id="s301">I think it was June the 25th.</span> <span id="s302">Being that___________ was only twelve kilometers from Rovno and my family lived in Rovno, and I didn’t see them for a long time, I decided to go to Rovno to see my family.</span> <span id="s303">I was assigned to a post to be back at 10 o’clock at night, to watch a certain part of the main terminal of__________and I was free until 10 o’clock that evening.</span> <span id="s304">So I went to Rovno and met my family.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: They didn’t know you were coming?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: They didn’t know I was coming, they were very happy to see me, they thought I was already dead, maybe, or whatever, and I decided at that time, there were bombardments while I was in Rovno.</span> <span id="s307">During the day the German airplanes used to fly in and bombard sections of the city.</span> <span id="s308">In order for my family to be safer, I told them to move to a section which was called Kapkaz that was the other part of the city, like one section is towards east of the city like facing the Russians and we had an uncle who was the keeper of the synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Tape 1, Side 1</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: To bring them over to that part of the town was already late and I had to go back to____________where I was assigned to be there at 10 o’clock.</span> <span id="s311">Because about 7:30 or 8’clock, I left my family, I said goodbye to my father, my whole family and (a portion of tape is blank).</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: I am going to repeat a few sentences.</span> <span id="s313">When I brought my family over to Kafkaz it was late in the day and I had to go back to Slobonov where I was assigned.</span> <span id="s314">We didn’t know at the time that the Germans are going to take over most of the territory.</span> <span id="s315">We figured it’s just a temporary thing and the Russians are going to be able to fight back the Germans and life is going to go on normal.</span> <span id="s316">I was responsible for my job where I was in Slobonov so I had to leave my family.</span> <span id="s317">My mother did not want me to go back.</span> <span id="s318">She insisted I should stay with the family, in that synagogue.</span> <span id="s319">I spoke to my father, he was more like sort of reasonable, and he said to me, I remember and I’ll never forget it, he said, my son, you are a grown man, you have to make your own decisions what to do.</span> <span id="s320">If you think that it is important for you to go back, then you have to go back.</span> <span id="s321">So I had no problems with my father, but my mother was insisting I should stay with them.</span> <span id="s322">I made up my mind to go back because I felt that if I don’t, I will be responsible for the job I’m supposed to do on the railroad in Slobonov because it is a major depot place where soldiers and with the Russian soldiers and they had to be transported from one place to the other and it was important for me to be there.</span> <span id="s323">So, I said to my parents that I’m going to be there tonight.</span> <span id="s324">After I finish my job in the morning I’ll see you back.</span> <span id="s325">I’ll come back to the city and see you again.</span> <span id="s326">On the way to Slobonov walking, I walked out about six kilometers, about half way, from the city of Rovno to Slobonov there was an attack.</span> <span id="s327">It was sort of getting dark that day, already late in the day, and I was walking with the road of the railroad, that’s how I came to Slobonov and a lot of planes were coming towards us and there were another few people and everyone was hiding and I was also hiding from the airplanes.</span> <span id="s328">We didn’t know they were going to attack us, they were flying very low and I saw them go towards Rovno, towards the city of Rovno.</span> <span id="s329">A few minutes later I looked out, all the airplanes they spread like sort of in one line and they attacked the city of Rovno from one end to the other.</span> <span id="s330">And a few minutes later I saw the whole city burning.</span> <span id="s331">I was six kilometers out of the city.</span> <span id="s332">It was very hard for me to make a decision what to do now.</span> <span id="s333">I didn’t know whether my family was killed at the time or not, because the city was on fire from one end to the other.</span> <span id="s334">I made a decision to go to work because I figured like that.</span> <span id="s335">If I don’t go to work and nothing happened to my family I would be a deserter, because I was sort of mobilized already by the Russian army to be on the railroad, and then they will kill me as a deserter, the Russian government.</span> <span id="s336">If my family is dead, I won’t see them anyhow.</span> <span id="s337">So I decided that in the morning when I finish my work, I will run back to the city.</span> <span id="s338">Being that I came back to Slobonov I was on my place of work, watching the cars on the outside.</span> <span id="s339">I was assigned to that, we had a few attacks in the middle, like already dark later on, we had attacks by the German airplanes on the railroad, on the station.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: On your station?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: On the station that I was working.</span> <span id="s342">A whole group of people started to run out of the station because they aimed at the depot, at the station where I was working.</span> <span id="s343">And I ran out to the outskirts of Slobonov.</span> <span id="s344">We went into a house a few kilometers from the depot, from the Slobonov station and I walked into the house and I said I have to stay here, I have to rest until this thing is over and I’ll have to rest here in your house and the woman did not disagree, she let us in, there were a few men already sleeping on the floor, and she said I have no room, the only place I have is on the floor.</span> <span id="s345">If you want to accept it, it’s O.K. I asked her, I said please, if I fall asleep, wake me up, but early, early in the morning.</span> <span id="s346">Being that I was tired and I didn’t sleep for a few days, traveling from Lubov to Rovno, I was very tired so I fell asleep on the floor.</span> <span id="s347">I was so tired that the woman just couldn’t get me up early in the morning and she let me sleep.</span> <span id="s348">She didn’t know the reason why I had to be up early.</span> <span id="s349">About 8 o’clock, sort of, in the morning I got up.</span> <span id="s350">I said, why didn’t you wake me up, I was supposed to be on the station working.</span> <span id="s351">Well, I walked out of the house and I ran towards the station where I was supposed to be working.</span> <span id="s352">As I came close to the rails, I saw German tank facing a column of Russian soldiers with their gun from the tank pointing at them and all the Russians with their hands up were standing in front of their building from that column.</span> <span id="s353">And I couldn’t figure it out that the Germans were there already because I didn’t see Germans until that point, that was the first tank I ever saw German except in the air, the bombardment.</span> <span id="s354">So I walked around behind the tank.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: You didn’t have a uniform on?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: I had a uniform, I had a railroad uniform on but not a Russian soldier uniform and behind the tank I just passed, they didn’t mind me they only wanted the soldiers and they didn’t do anything to me.</span> <span id="s357">So I walked right up.</span> <span id="s358">It was an uphill, I walked up to the railroad and I went into the station and I took a look.</span> <span id="s359">During the night most of the trains and locomotives were evacuated going east while I was asleep and I didn’t see anybody on the station.</span> <span id="s360">Everybody was evacuated.</span> <span id="s361">It was empty.</span> <span id="s362">It was a very foolish, stupid episode that if you’re interested I’ll tell you that I carried a little suitcase, I had some underwear, clothes that I had and I put it in a warehouse when I came down with the train from Slobonov originally, and it was in that warehouse.</span> <span id="s363">I figured if I have to run I got to have my suitcase so I ran to that warehouse and there was still an old woman closing up to run away too.</span> <span id="s364">I said to her, I have my suitcase with my clothes in it, I would like to get it.</span> <span id="s365">There were hundreds of suitcases lying there, I was looking for my personal suitcase which didn’t have much to look at and I found my suitcase and with the suitcase I ran towards the smoke that I saw going east from the chimney.</span> <span id="s366">The smoke was coming out of the locomotives, they were going one after the other probably about two kilometers away from the station already.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: To the east?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: To the east.</span> <span id="s369">I decided to go as fast as I can towards those locomotives and they were going very slow because they couldn’t, looks like ahead of them they had some problems, so they were traveling very slow and I could catch up with them, and the last locomotive was a friend of mine that also was operating that locomotive.</span> <span id="s370">When he saw me run he slowed down and he picked me up.</span> <span id="s371">And on that locomotive I was until we got into Russia.</span> <span id="s372">Never had a chance to go back to Rovno to see if my family was alive or dead.</span> <span id="s373">And this was the last time I ever saw my family.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: June 25?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: About June 26th.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: Your mother was afraid for you or afraid for herself and family?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: I think my mother was, she wanted to keep the family together.</span> <span id="s378">Being I was the only one out working, so she wanted me to be with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: Did you ever find out what happened to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: Well, after I was working, I was on the railroad traveling around for six months, I was assigned in Russia to be on a group of railroad people, a special transport that would be kept in case they need us for work with the military.</span> <span id="s381">So as the Russians, which most of the time they were retreating, the Russian army, we were like sort of behind the lines traveling back and forth in case the government would need a transport for some reason.</span> <span id="s382">So I was on the railroad for six months, just living in cars with a whole group, hundreds of people, of railroad people, that worked on the railroad for the purpose of restoring the railroad if it was bombarded, for transporting military back and fort.</span> <span id="s383">So my job at the time was just to travel.</span> <span id="s384">That’s why I lived and as the Russians were retreating so did we with the transport we were retreating.</span> <span id="s385">Where we got up to a town further away from Harkov.</span> <span id="s386">I don’t remember that town that we stayed.</span> <span id="s387">As I was working on the station over there we actually parked at that place and we worked at the station and I used to go out to see all the transports that were coming by this station going east towards Russia and they called them_________, people that run away from the occupied areas of Germany, people that were running away from the front.</span> <span id="s388">Whoever could evacuate themselves, they were passing by our station and I was checking every car to look for relatives, friends from the city of Rovno.</span> <span id="s389">Whether they were passing by too.</span> <span id="s390">And I looked into every car as they were coming by.</span> <span id="s391">I met one guy and he was a son of one of our landlords and he knew my family very well.</span> <span id="s392">He met me and he told me that my family, my father, met him on the station in Harkov, that’s a city in Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: Far away?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: It was in the Ukraine.</span> <span id="s395">It wasn’t, I don’t know exactly the mileage how far it was from Rovno, but it was still the Ukraine.</span> <span id="s396">He said to me that my father approached me and asked him whether he saw me.</span> <span id="s397">And at that time, nobody saw me, and he said to my father, no.</span> <span id="s398">Well, he repeated those words to me when he met me.</span> <span id="s399">He said my father asked if I saw you, but I did not see you until now.</span> <span id="s400">He knew that, he said to me that the whole family and my father were in a school in Harkov, and they were waiting for evacuation further, or something.</span> <span id="s401">He continued and I decided to go to Harkov, which was already evacuated.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: When was this now?</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: This was in 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: Months later?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: No, not that much later.</span> <span id="s406">I would say maybe a month.</span> <span id="s407">Sometimes, I would say, in July.</span> <span id="s408">I don’t remember the date.</span> <span id="s409">Bit I decided to run and take the first transport that goes there and being I worked on the railroad, I could travel and I traveled towards Harkov.</span> <span id="s410">I walked on the streets, which were deserted.</span> <span id="s411">There were no people in Harkov anymore.</span> <span id="s412">I tried to find somebody to direct me to a certain school, I came to that school and nobody was there.</span> <span id="s413">I came back to the same city I worked and did not meet anybody in Harkov.</span> <span id="s414">The whole city was deserted and evacuated.</span> <span id="s415">That was the only information that I ever had about my family.</span> <span id="s416">Whether they remained in the city, whether they were evacuated someplace, whether they walked out, I will never know.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: This person that you described, he’s the last person you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: He was the only one that I ever met.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: That was July?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: It was sometime in July in Harkov.</span> <span id="s421">And that’s it.</span> <span id="s422">Since then…</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: And after the war you never found out.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: After the war, I’m going to jump a little bit.</span> <span id="s425">After the war I managed to get out of Russia, I traveled, they told us that we will go to Poland.</span> <span id="s426">Rovno the city of Rovno remained under the Russian government after the war, because this was part of the Ukraine and never changed hands back to Poland.</span> <span id="s427">On the way back I managed to get out of Russia and we were supposed to travel towards Kovid, it’s a city, Kovid, and my transport got diverted instead of going to Kovid, went towards Rovno.</span> <span id="s428">Overnight was traveling and in the morning I get up and I walk out on the station and when I opened up the doors, we stopped at that station, and as I opened up the door I see a church, the one I mentioned before, a Polish church, which I recognized, I figured that every city in Poland, I knew I was in Poland but I didn’t know which town, I figured in my mind that every city in Poland has a church like that.</span> <span id="s429">So I say this must be Poland already, because I see the church is just like the one we had in Rovno.</span> <span id="s430">The rest of the town was completely bombarded, it was leveled.</span> <span id="s431">So as I walk out of the station, I didn’t recognize the station, it was also bombarded, demolished, and I asked one man that was passing by, I asked him, I say what city is this?</span> <span id="s432">He says to me this is Rovno.</span> <span id="s433">Can you imagine the guy telling me, I was born in Rovno, I knew the whole city and I didn’t recognize it.</span> <span id="s434">Only recognized the church that was sticking out.</span> <span id="s435">It looked like they never aimed at churches or big synagogues because that survived in the city in Rovno.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: Synagogues survived too?</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: One big synagogue which looked like a church.</span> <span id="s438">The main synagogue in the city of Rovno survived, and I visited Russia recently and I saw that synagogue.</span> <span id="s439">I was in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: How about the one in which your family was hiding in?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: No, that didn’t survived.</span> <span id="s442">Most of the houses were demolished.</span> <span id="s443">I couldn’t even recognize the area where my family was.</span> <span id="s444">It was completely rebuilt.</span> <span id="s445">The whole city was rebuilt.</span> <span id="s446">It had only happened a few years ago when I was there.</span> <span id="s447">When I saw this in Rovno, I wasn’t able to remain because my transport was going toward Kovid and Krakow and I had to stay on the transport that was taking me out of Russia until I came to the borders of Poland, and we entered Poland somewheres near Krakow.</span> <span id="s448">When I first got off, on the first station as we entered Poland in 1946, we saw the Polish officers, checking us out and we immediately noticed the anti-Semitism right away was worse than it was in Russia.</span> <span id="s449">They greeted us with hatred and you can understand what kind of feeling I had and I thought I made a mistake coming back to Poland.</span> <span id="s450">I came back to Poland only to have freedom, but I didn’t find it in the behavior of the Polish people.</span> <span id="s451">So I traveled from there to a town which was Bittem.</span> <span id="s452">It was somewheres, I think it was__________, the town of Bittem.</span> <span id="s453">It used to be a German, a lot of German people used to live there before the war.</span> <span id="s454">When I came to the town a group of Zionist, young people, came to the transport and asked all the young Jewish people that came from Russia to join the Zionist organization and from there go to Israel.</span> <span id="s455">Being that I was single and I didn’t find my family, I knew I was all alone and young, I decided to join this organization which I was with them for quite a while and working with the organization in Bittem.</span> <span id="s456">If it was of interest to you, this whole organization was trying to snuggle into Israel.</span> <span id="s457">It was Palestine at the time, under the British occupation and the situation at that time before the Jewish State was established, was controlled by the British and they didn’t allow any Jewish people to settle, they took them all to Cypress and other camps where they caught them on the open seas.</span> <span id="s458">But, nevertheless, we all tried very hard to get there one way or the other, because Poland was no more a place for Jews.</span> <span id="s459">During the time I was in that particular place, I was assigned from the organization to go on the market and buy out all the soap, which was called Rif, in Germany it was called__________, it was made out of Jewish people and openly the German people on the market were selling that particular soap in bags.</span> <span id="s460">It looks like it must have been with the help of the Israeli government or the Jewish government, we used to buy that soap out of the markets, wherever we saw it being sold and eventually, I understand it, that soap went to Israel, it was buried because it was made out of Jewish people’s fat.</span> <span id="s461">So this was one of my jobs in that particular organization in Bittem.</span> <span id="s462">We also tried to find children, Jewish children that were kept in some Christian homes and we tried to buy them out from the Christian people to be able to go back to Israel.</span> <span id="s463">And we managed to find a lot of Jewish children through certain ways and investigations who had children like that.</span> <span id="s464">Some Christian, Polish families took in very, very young Jewish children and they kept them as their own.</span> <span id="s465">Which was very nice.</span> <span id="s466">Some Christian families did not want to give up their children.</span> <span id="s467">But a lot of them decided to allow them to go back to Israel where they belong and we paid, the Jewish government, the Israeli government paid a certain amount for them as a price for the good deeds that they did.</span> <span id="s468">Later on, I am not going to go into details about what happened when Poland attacked, the Polish government attacked our house.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: The building…</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: The building where the Jewish organization was we had ninety people in this building and in the middle of the night they tried to attack, the Polish army tried to attack us, which we resisted.</span> <span id="s471">We had some guns with us but they decided and not get into that building.</span> <span id="s472">That building was closed, it had a gate, pretty strong gate and they didn’t break the gate.</span> <span id="s473">Somehow they went away and this what happened over there.</span> <span id="s474">This was in Bittem, and we called on the telephone the Russian military which was stationed in that town, and the Russian military told us on the telephone that they don’t interfere with the Polish government.</span> <span id="s475">S they didn’t want to help us.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: When did this incident take place?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: This incident took place, 1946.</span> <span id="s478">There came an order from, it looks like, you know we were involved with the_________ and other organizations that worked underground from Israel to bring the people, the Jewish people into Israel at the time.</span> <span id="s479">An order came for us to depart Bittem, start going towards sort of Italy and we had to go to another town which was called Katowice and from Katowice we had special papers made for us like new names and the names were given to all the ninety people, more than ninety because families of these youngsters that lived outside of this particular building were also taken at the same time so all of us were given Greek names, each one had a Greek name sort of, that we were not Jews but Greeks escaping, going to Greece and we got false documents with Polish stamps that we were Greeks and in the middle of the night, one night, we smuggled the border from Poland to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s480">We had a special guide in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s481">Old and young, were walking through the woods in the dark and people were falling and it was raining that night, and was mud on our feet, but we had to go as fast as possible because the guide he knew the way and he was going fast.</span> <span id="s482">So the whole length of that echelon, all the people that were going in one line sort of, it stretched for a long way, we managed to get in to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s483">And we had an assigned building that was waiting for us.</span> <span id="s484">They took us to that particular house.</span> <span id="s485">We came in all muddy with shoes full of mud and wet.</span> <span id="s486">We had to wash ourselves outside in the middle of the night and from there we had to go, the woman from the house took care of us, and we had something to eat and early in the morning they brought a truck, a flat truck sort of, maybe about two feet high, flatbed not covered, they took all the older people and the children, the young children, on that truck, and it traveled to Bratislava.</span> <span id="s487">Lying down on the truck like from________, that was the town that we started, right on the border to Bratislava, the older people were lying and they were covered with a canvas, and that’s how they traveled all the way to Bratislava to a hotel where they had in Bratislava for the refugees.</span> <span id="s488">The younger people were assigned to go by train so being that________ is a tiny little town, didn’t see too many people, slowly two by two, a boy and a girl, walked towards the train station and we wanted to buy tickets.</span> <span id="s489">As we went to the station, two by two, not in a group, the station manager, whoever was there, noticed that so many people are here.</span> <span id="s490">He never had that many people going by train to Bratislava that he called the police, the Czechoslovakian police, the police came and arrested us.</span> <span id="s491">Naturally we had documents that we were Greeks so we had to, Greek we did not know how to speak, so we spoke whatever we knew in the Seder, in the praying book, so sort of this kind of language sort of we spoke.</span> <span id="s492">We didn’t understand each other, but we made believe that we speak Greek.</span> <span id="s493">They arrested us, the whole group.</span> <span id="s494">A Jewish organization in Bratislava found out that we were arrested by the Czechoslovakian police, they worked very hard and they got us out and they transferred us to Bratislava into that hotel where we were going to leave Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s495">They didn’t want us there.</span> <span id="s496">So we were lucky that they didn’t send us back to Poland because we really smuggled out of that country with false papers.</span> <span id="s497">When we got to Bratislava they organized a group of, about 200 people, to go to the border to come to Vienna.</span> <span id="s498">The leadership that was in charge of that group had a permission to take out twenty people out of Czechoslovakia on the border crossing.</span> <span id="s499">They made 200 out of that twenty, they added another zero and they took 200 people on that particular document.</span> <span id="s500">When we came to the border, they gave the Czechoslovakian guard on the border a couple of cartons of American cigarettes.</span> <span id="s501">So we crossed the border and now we are in no-man’s land.</span> <span id="s502">We came to the Russian side which was part of Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: The Russian occupation zone?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: The Russian occupation zone of Vienna.</span> <span id="s505">They gave them a couple of bottles of vodka and they let us through.</span> <span id="s506">So we boarded a streetcar in Vienna and with the streetcar we went to the American side of Vienna and we stayed in the Rothschild Hospital in Vienna.</span> <span id="s507">That was like sort of a place, we organized that hospital as a transition place, a place for refugees until it was time to go further towards Italy.</span> <span id="s508">My uncle Menachim was with me at certain times.</span> <span id="s509">He found me in Russia.</span> <span id="s510">That was my mother’s youngest brother.</span> <span id="s511">He was in the Russian army and then he was bombarded and shot.</span> <span id="s512">He wound up in certain parts of Russia where he found me accidentally and I was with him at certain places.</span> <span id="s513">Which, if you are interested, later on I will go into it.</span> <span id="s514">He volunteered during Russia he volunteered to the army and we separated again in Russia.</span> <span id="s515">He was in Czechoslovakia until the end of the war even after the war, fighting Germans and somehow he survived and he wound up in__________, in a camp, displaced persons camp, where he was in sort of citizens police, in camp police, as a policeman.</span> <span id="s516">All the Zionist organizations had a conference in this camp and through one person at the conference he found out that I was in Vienna on the American side in Rothschild Hospital.</span> <span id="s517">That person at the conference took a message to me telling me about my uncle that he is living in_________, which at that time I did not know where it was, and I should pick myself up and travel with the next transport that passes by Linz and he’ll wait for me.</span> <span id="s518">Well, I excused myself from this organization because I was with the Zionist organization going towards Israel all this time, and I said my uncle was there and if you don’t mind I want to travel to meet him.</span> <span id="s519">That was the first relative I ever found since the war started.</span> <span id="s520">And, as I was traveling, they gave me permission and I was traveling towards Linz.</span> <span id="s521">He was waiting for me, he didn’t know which transport, but he was waiting for one transport to the other until he found me on the transport.</span> <span id="s522">But the transport was not supposed to stop in Linz, only stop there for refueling or something, water.</span> <span id="s523">That transport was going towards Italy with Jewish people that were going to Israel.</span> <span id="s524">And as I came to Linz I knew that somebody was going to wait for me at the station.</span> <span id="s525">I looked out the window and he spotted me and he was in sort of a Jewish with a Star of David on his sleeve, with a whistle on his neck over here with a uniform Jewish Police, with a hat.</span> <span id="s526">So somehow the Austrian police at the station allowed him to get me off that transport and take me with him.</span> <span id="s527">And that’s how I was able to get into this particular camp or displaced persons camp.</span> <span id="s528">He signed me into that camp which was a little hard because this particular camp__________ did not allow new people to sign into that camp.</span> <span id="s529">The only ones that they allowed was brothers, sisters, relatives that were there and if they found them they allowed them to take into the same room they had in the camp.</span> <span id="s530">Because there was no room in this camp for newcomers.</span> <span id="s531">He managed to do that by saying that I was his brother, not a nephew and I was able to get into this camp under the name of Grossman, which was his name too, my name was changed a few times before that, so I accepted the name Grossman.</span> <span id="s532">He accepted the name Grossman because he knew that in America his brothers names were Grossman, so he didn’t want to make complications, so he marked the name Grossman and I became a Grossman which I was a few times before when I met him, and that’s how I am a Grossman all this time it would be too hard to explain to anybody why I am not Tannenbaum, but Grossman.</span> <span id="s533">So under Grossman I live in the United States since I came here.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: What year?</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: 1948.</span> <span id="s536">That’s after the present.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: Now earlier we left you… Tape 2, Side 1.</span> <span id="s538">(Something is missing in going from tape 1 to tape 2)</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: We’re in Zagorsk and we built that…; it was called in Russian_____________, in Russian.</span> <span id="s540">And that’s the railroad that will protect Moscow because Stalin decided, and we did.</span> <span id="s541">We did and we ran it around Moscow and when Hitler came close to Moscow, about twelve kilometers, from one part of this railroad, he probably saw it and he saw Moscow already through his binoculars.</span> <span id="s542">But he never crossed that railroad and the railroad many times was bombarded and destroyed and rebuilt and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s543">There was an order by the Russian government to take all these railroad people that were working, hundreds, maybe thousands that were all around Russia, around Moscow, excuse me, to ship them, and they were getting ready in Stalingrad and this must, I don’t remember the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: Would this be after the winter?</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: I don’t, I can’t recall the time when Stalingrad made the_______.</span> <span id="s546">Maybe in 1942 or the beginning of ’42, something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: You passed the winter near Moscow?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s549">When I found out that this transport is going to Stalingrad and I figure they are pushing, according to the information I got, I knew that I am going to have to fight for Stalingrad and probably get killed like everybody else did.</span> <span id="s550">But I decided to go deeper into Russia.</span> <span id="s551">And I took a group of four guys, four railroad people that I knew; they were from Kovid, from my area.</span> <span id="s552">I told them, I said, now we’re not going to work on the railroad anymore, looks like we’re going into some kind of a different uniform and we’re going to have to fight or shoot or something like that, because the whole transport is going towards Stalingrad.</span> <span id="s553">If you want, I say we should do another thing and go someplace else.</span> <span id="s554">Being that we didn’t know where to go, but we decided, all the five of us, decided to escape from that place because we are not needed anymore, in the middle of the night we went from that place.</span> <span id="s555">We were not arrested or kept under special supervision, but if somebody would see us go away from that transport they would be suspicious.</span> <span id="s556">So in the middle of the night we decided to go to the railroad station that was not far from Zagorsch and go wherever it is possible to go deeper to Russia, deeper in Russia because the Germans were very close.</span> <span id="s557">We found, I particular noticed a transport that was assembled with cars from the Moscow Metro and they were already stationed, they were on platforms, platform beds on the railroad cars and those cars were hooked up next to these particular platform station.</span> <span id="s558">I said to my friends, I say, look, I don’t know where, but when I was in Moscow I saw these particular cars in the metro, in the underground, in the subway.</span> <span id="s559">I think that these trains are being evacuated because they are valuable trains, they were very nice and if they are evacuated they are not going to the front they are probably going toward deep into Russia.</span> <span id="s560">If we manage to get on this particular train we will probably go towards Russia, because we did not get information where the transport is going.</span> <span id="s561">So that train took off and went to a town of Gorki, which was north and east.</span> <span id="s562">It was, now I remember, it was wintertime, it was cold, so it must have been between ’41 and ’42, because I froze my hands someplace near Gorki.</span> <span id="s563">We went into certain, there were cars, on flatbeds, there were also trucks standing on the platforms so we managed to get into a door into the trucks and we were traveling in that particular truck in the cabins all the way to Gorki in the cold.</span> <span id="s564">When we got to Gorki, we found out it was Gorki, we really didn’t know that we’re going to come to Gorki.</span> <span id="s565">We came to Gorki we saw a whole transport of wounded soldiers.</span> <span id="s566">We were still in the uniform of the railroad.</span> <span id="s567">We had our uniforms on.</span> <span id="s568">We went in to speak to, there were passenger train, a lot of refugees were there in Gorki and they didn’t allow anybody to hook on to this train because there were wounded soldiers from the front sort of going deep.</span> <span id="s569">Being that they were wounded soldiers, I didn’t think that these soldiers are going towards the front, they were going to deep into Russia for treatment.</span> <span id="s570">So we decided as railroad people to go with them, but they didn’t allow us to go into the inside of the train to the compartments because they were soldiers and we were railroad people, but they allowed us to stay in between the cars on the outside and travel till the next station, maybe we’ll find another transport someplace else.</span> <span id="s571">We traveled for a while.</span> <span id="s572">I know when I came off I was all frozen, my hands were frozen and all the other guys were all frozen traveling in between the trains and we got out of Gorki.</span> <span id="s573">We managed to hook onto some refugee trains later on in the cattle cars.</span> <span id="s574">When we got into some cars there were also refugees from Europe, from Russia, from all different towns and we managed to get in there with them, travel to Quebishov, there’s a town Quebishov and from Quebishov they took us to Tashkent, we got off in Tashkent, that’s Asia already.</span> <span id="s575">On the way we had a lot of trouble because the sanitary ways were very bad and we had lice and sicknesses and typhoid and all kinds of sicknesses among the people, but we managed, I managed to get to Tashkent.</span> <span id="s576">In Tashkent as a railroad guy and as a student for a certain school in Russia in_________, I made an appointment with the chief of the railroad from the Tashkent.</span> <span id="s577">I was lucky enough that he made an appointment for me to see him and when I got up there, he was an old man, he was the chief, the Kamisar, they call it, and I told him that, I told him a little lie, that we were bombarded o the road as I was traveling and my transport that I was with disappeared and I managed to come here and I am looking for a place to live and to stay and to work on the railroad.</span> <span id="s578">Well he gave us a place, he told me O.K., you as a machinist, you know mechanics, we’ll give you a job on a machine on a certain machine to work, but the other four I don’t have any place except for a place in Tashkent to work on the same machine that was cutting railroad ties for the railroad.</span> <span id="s579">They would be pushing the trees up to the machine by hand and that will be their job.</span> <span id="s580">He gave us a place to live in Tashkent, a dorm.</span> <span id="s581">They took us into places where we could clean ourselves up and delouse ourselves and we lived there.</span> <span id="s582">I lived in Tashkent for about nine months working on that machine, which even though there was hunger and not enough food, but I survived in that place.</span> <span id="s583">Before I got the job, I was sleeping in Tashkent on the railway station where every morning hundreds of people died, they took out, they found in the morning.</span> <span id="s584">They used to clean up the station, they found dead people from typhoid that they used to pick him up and just throw him on the wagon.</span> <span id="s585">These were all refugees, and I couldn’t live like that, that’s why I went to look for that job, and I was lucky enough to be able to get that job and signed in to Tashkent under the name of Gedale Tenenboim.</span> <span id="s586">And I worked there for nine months with the machine in this factory until my uncle, Menachim came down to the station.</span> <span id="s587">He passed through Tashkent, he was on his way to the Polish army with a group.</span> <span id="s588">He was dismissed from the Russian army, he was wounded in his thigh and his mouth, but the Russians did not trust the Polish people to be in the Russian army so they dismissed all the Ukrainian Polish citizens, so that before the Russians took over.</span> <span id="s589">They told them that if you want to go and join you can join the____________army in Russia which was forming up there.</span> <span id="s590">When he stopped on the way to Guzar which was near the Afghanistan border, that’s where the Polish army made, accepted their recruits.</span> <span id="s591">He stopped in Taskent and he found a friend from the city of Rovno and he asked him what, who are the people that he knows that are from Rovno.</span> <span id="s592">Maybe there are some people.</span> <span id="s593">He mentioned to him that I know there is one guy Gedale Tennenboim that comes here every morning, I used to work nights on the machine.</span> <span id="s594">In the morning I used to go to the station to look for relatives, whoever passes by or who stops maybe I’ll find some relatives of my mother or father or brothers or sister.</span> <span id="s595">He met me and he said, he used to meet me all the time and we used to talk to each other.</span> <span id="s596">When he saw my uncle he didn’t know that he was my uncle; he only mentioned my name as there is one guy Gedale Tennenboim that works here in Tashkent.</span> <span id="s597">He said Gedale Tennenboim, that’s my sister’s son.</span> <span id="s598">To make it short, he went to the____________ bureau in Russia, in Tashkent, where everybody that works in the city, not as a refugee, but if he works there has to be signed to the city, signed up as a citizen of the city.</span> <span id="s599">I was signed in the books where I work and my name was right there.</span> <span id="s600">He looked it up and they told him where I am, he came to the place where I was working and I’m not going to go into the details how we met.</span> <span id="s601">It was quite a scene and he told me that now that I have found you, you have to go with me.</span> <span id="s602">I said I can’t leave the machine.</span> <span id="s603">I’m working at night, night is my time when I have to be at the machine.</span> <span id="s604">There are forty people working on this particular machine.</span> <span id="s605">If I don’t show up they can’t work.</span> <span id="s606">And he says never mind, he says, you’re going with me.</span> <span id="s607">He had a list of about fifteen people that was in a group that was going with him.</span> <span id="s608">A lot of them disappeared on the road so the list got smaller and smaller.</span> <span id="s609">One of the names from that particular list I took.</span> <span id="s610">I don’t remember the name and I decided to go with him.</span> <span id="s611">Naturally, I deserted my job and I was shaking pretty badly because if the Russian_________, or the KGB would find me, they would probably hang me.</span> <span id="s612">The next morning I was already back on the station with all of the refugees and the way I came to Tashkent and the next morning there was a train going to this particular spot of Guzar_________ near the Afghanistan_______ border where the Polish were recruiting members to go to England from Russia.</span> <span id="s613">And I went with him and took one of the names on that list that he had.</span> <span id="s614">And on the way there was, they call it an ablava the Russian_________ were checking all the people on that station and checking their passports, their names.</span> <span id="s615">All my passports, all my documents, all the pictures that I had with me I had to destroy at that particular station.</span> <span id="s616">I went into the toilet, threw out all my pictures of my family, of my brothers, whatever I had with me, my parents, all documents under the name of Tenenboim, all my passports, and my documents that I had and I had to destroy because I was sort of a deserter from this particular work place and that was the end of my name Tenenboim.</span> <span id="s617">From there on I took the name what was on that paper, I don’t remember the name because it was a very short time and we went to Cuzar.</span> <span id="s618">And when I came to Cuzar with my uncle to sign up to the Polish army to fight the Germans from the English side.</span> <span id="s619">It was supposed to take all the Polish people.</span> <span id="s620">Bring them to sort of Palestine, from Palestine they took them back to England and fight from maybe down there.</span> <span id="s621">I don’t know what the English were going to do with them, but help the English people fight Germany.</span> <span id="s622">And we wanted to sign up.</span> <span id="s623">When they took me for a medical examination, which they undressed us completely.</span> <span id="s624">At that particular point in Cuzar I was rejected because they found out that I was circumcised and I am Jewish, not Polish even though I spoke Polish and my uncle spoke Polish and we were born in Poland, but because we were Jewish they didn’t accept us.</span> <span id="s625">And they gave me a document, in Polish it was written_________.</span> <span id="s626">They gave me a document under the name of Grisorus which was the original name of my uncle, and I said I am Grisorus and the accepted it, they made me Grisorus and since then I was Grisorus.</span> <span id="s627">And I had to leave.</span> <span id="s628">They didn’t accept me or my uncle.</span> <span id="s629">From that point on the Russians had to go back to Russia, stay in Russia and they, because I was a Polish born person, they took me to different places of work, camp.</span> <span id="s630">They called it___________.</span> <span id="s631">That was work, it was an army sort of, out of civilians that were not labor, that were not taken to the Russian army because we were Polish citizens and they only took us from one camp to another camp and they shipped us to places of work like farms where they needed workers and all kind of different places, from one place to the other.</span> <span id="s632">The last place that I was, because I can’t go into that certain.</span> <span id="s633">I have to skip over that.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: You were all over the place?</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: I was all over the place and they worked me very hard.</span> <span id="s636">The last place we were was Danscoya.</span> <span id="s637">In Danscoya I was with my uncle.</span> <span id="s638">He decided to volunteer to the army and he escaped from that particular town into the recruiting place of the Russian army.</span> <span id="s639">He wanted to volunteer to fight the Germans and anybody that volunteered over there to the Russian army they took, ‘cause they needed people to fight, and he was accepted.</span> <span id="s640">He left me behind in this particular place, this was Khazikstan and not far from_____________, the place was called Danscoya____________.</span> <span id="s641">The place was a place where they were digging ore mines and also had political prisoners.</span> <span id="s642">It was 200 kilometers from___________.</span> <span id="s643">It was very hard to escape from there because the wilderness was all around the place of Danscoya.</span> <span id="s644">You couldn’t escape.</span> <span id="s645">Even the prisoners couldn’t escape.</span> <span id="s646">It was 200 kilometers to walk in the wilderness some wolf or they had wild animals on the road, they would eat you up.</span> <span id="s647">So nobody could escape from that place and this is the last place I was.</span> <span id="s648">When the war ended I tried to sign up as a Polish citizen to go back to Poland.</span> <span id="s649">I had to provide certain documents, which I didn’t have under the name of Grisaurus.</span> <span id="s650">I showed a picture with epaulets that I kept.</span> <span id="s651">.</span> <span id="s652">That particular picture I didn’t destroy because there was nothing written, but was only written something in Polish with a stamp on the corner from the school that I went to in Poland in Rovno.</span> <span id="s653">And that particular picture I kept with me.</span> <span id="s654">I still have it today, a copy of it in my album and because of the epaulets, it was from a Zionist organization, so we had those in Poland and the corner of it was written in Polish from a Polish school.</span> <span id="s655">It wasn’t written Rovno because that part of Rovno was not on the picture, like a corner of the picture was showing but it was written in Polish so they could read it.</span> <span id="s656">They accepted me as a Polish citizen only because of that picture and I was able to get documents to get out of Russia under this picture, under this document.</span> <span id="s657">That’s how I came back to Poland where I met my first anti-Semites near Krakow.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: That was some experience.</span> <span id="s659">In your work I know you worked in private research, you were never able to find out what happened to the rest of your family?</span> <span id="s660">Either through your uncle.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: Yes I have applications with the Red Cross who are looking into it now.</span> <span id="s662">It will probably take a year, but I don’t believe they will ever find it.</span> <span id="s663">My father would be today, if he was alive, he would have been 92 years old and my mother would have been 90.</span> <span id="s664">My younger brothers recently.</span> <span id="s665">My younger brothers I can’t find them, but I’m looking for them for the last fifty years.</span> <span id="s666">I have documents over here that I wrote every place you could think of to look for my family.</span> <span id="s667">I was under the impression because of the information that I got from that friend of mine in Harkov that told me that he met my father, that maybe they are alive in Russia someplace.</span> <span id="s668">And I did everything.</span> <span id="s669">I wrote to Moscow, I wrote to HIAS, I wrote to Yad Vashem in Israel, any organization that is available, private organizations, that are searching for people and I never was able to get any information whether they are alive or dead.</span> <span id="s670">I was under the impression for many years that they are alive.</span> <span id="s671">I was hoping, and even today I still hope, that maybe they are alive.</span> <span id="s672">But I have doubt.</span> <span id="s673">Just recently the last year I gave up and I decided, no, they are not alive.</span> <span id="s674">I went to see the graves three and a half years ago to the city where I was born, Rovno.</span> <span id="s675">I took my wife and my daughter, who was born in the United States, and we went there for a visit to the place where 17,500 Jews of that city was shot, murdered by the Germans with the help of the Ukrainian police over there in the place of Susneke, the woods, which I knew before the war very well and they were all shot.</span> <span id="s676">They assembled all the Jews, most of the Jews, and they were shot there between November 6 and 7, 1941, right after the Germans occupied the city.</span> <span id="s677">A few months later they destroyed all the Jews.</span> <span id="s678">Whatever was left later on, they had another 5,000 Jews and they kept them in ghettos and they were killed also.</span> <span id="s679">And another place, which was called Bially Street, I visited that particular place.</span> <span id="s680">I am under the impression that my whole family was killed over there and the information I got was false.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: You mean the friend of yours who saw them?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: I don’t believe it.</span> <span id="s683">Because I did all the years, I did all I could to look for them and I can’t find anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q: Did you recognize some of the names on the monument that you saw?</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A: The monument, I put in my family’s name on the monument down there now, because in 1990, the end of October 1990, I visited Rovno again to the opening of a big monument that the Russian government put up in place where the Jews were killed.</span> <span id="s686">Because up till now there was no mention that Jews were killed over there.</span> <span id="s687">Only sort of Russian citizens.</span> <span id="s688">But now they have a big tremendous monument with plates all around that particular monument.</span> <span id="s689">I have a picture of it, I’ll show you a picture of that particular spot, it’s tremendous, it’s very big.</span> <span id="s690">Seventy plates with 4,000 names of people that sort of got killed in this place are written.</span> <span id="s691">And I also registered my family there.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: Did you recognize other names there?</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: The names I didn’t see, I only know that after we left Rovno in 1990 where I visited, the plates were written.</span> <span id="s694">The other writing was in Yiddish, Hebrew and Ukrainian on the monument for the first time in Russia that they allowed things written in Yiddish in places like that.</span> <span id="s695">Because the other towns, every town in the Ukraine has a massacre place__________ has one, Ludsk has one, Kiev, Kovid has one__________ has one.</span> <span id="s696">All these towns, every town there was a massacre place where they killed the Jews.</span> <span id="s697">At that time they didn’t think of sending them to concentration camps.</span> <span id="s698">Therefore I don’t believe I’ll get any knowledge from, any information from_________, Germany because they did not take names of the people that they were killing in the towns.</span> <span id="s699">They just surrounded them, they told them to come and they just killed them.</span> <span id="s700">The information that I got from Rovno where I met people, Jewish people are still living in Rovno, they told me the whole story of what happened and how it happened.</span> <span id="s701">I met a woman in Rovno that survived, which I have on video.</span> <span id="s702">She survived the graves, she crawled out of the graves because that night she was not hit by bullet.</span> <span id="s703">She survived and crawled out nude and she ran to a Christian, a Ukrainian or Polish I don’t remember what she said, and they kept her and helped her to get dress and wash and she is one of the survivors.</span> <span id="s704">I met her in Rovno, she is there today, she is an older woman and she is one of the survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: Did any of the survivors know your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A: Down here in New York I have some people that knew my family.</span> <span id="s707">The people in Rovno that are there today did not know my family.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: So your last image of your family is that in the synagogue on the 26th of June 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Q: And you were going back to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A: That was the last time I saw them, yes.</span> <span id="s712">In 1941, I was probably--.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: Eighteen.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A: Eighteen years old?</span> <span id="s715">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: Starting out_______.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s718">Five years of my youth was just destroyed.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q: Do you recall saying goodbye to your brothers?</span></p> <p><span id="s720">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s721">There is a picture in my mind at all times.</span> <span id="s722">It never leaves, that picture.</span> <span id="s723">I will never forget because I remember when I said goodbye, my father took me around and hugged me and kissed me.</span> <span id="s724">My mother was crying and she was practically, like sort of hysterical, like she would know that I’ll never see her again.</span> <span id="s725">When I left her, I tried to be like a grown person because I had tears in my eyes.</span> <span id="s726">At the time, the tears are coming back to me right now as I’m talking to you, I didn’t want to show her that I’m like sort of a sissy that I’m crying and I didn’t turn my head back.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: Your brothers and sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: They were youngsters, they were kids and they didn’t understand much.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: Any further observations?</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A I am working now with Holocaust Search for the same purpose.</span> <span id="s731">That I know so many people are looking for relatives and I don’t think there is a better person than I am and dedicated more to that cause because I, myself, have the feeling and I know what it means to lose family and not to be able to see them again.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: Thank you Mr. Grossman.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A: You’re welcome.</span></p></body></html>
