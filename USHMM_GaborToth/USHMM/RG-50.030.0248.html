she was born in 1914.</span> <span id="s20">And we lived in Vienna.</span> <span id="s21">My father was...actually my grandfather had a store in Vienna; and my father was working with him.</span> <span id="s22">And he didn't like it.</span> <span id="s23">And, uh, he had, uh, two brothers, one was engineer; and the younger was...uh a doctor.</span> <span id="s24">And he hated the store and he hated office work; but he became then an accountant later on, you know.</span> <span id="s25">And, uh, we were together-- the whole family was together 'til the war broke out in 1914.</span> <span id="s26">And then my father had to go to war.</span> <span id="s27">And when he came back in 1918, he met somebody else.</span> <span id="s28">They met in Salzburg--that is close to Vienna.</span> <span id="s29">And when he came finally home, he was asking for a divorce.</span> <span id="s30">So, we had these four years of war, we had hardly anything to eat.</span> <span id="s31">My mother had to go out in the country, exchange her rings and everything for food, what it was like at this time.</span> <span id="s32">Everything was rationed.</span> <span id="s33">You had to get card or marks, cards for your food.</span> <span id="s34">You got frozen potatoes and all that stuff.</span> <span id="s35">Anyway, then finally when he got his...uh his divorce, we still--my sister and myself were still with my mother.</span> <span id="s36">Up until 19... until the time when I was ll.</span> <span id="s37">And he didn't give her any child support or anything.</span> <span id="s38">She had to raise the two of us.</span> <span id="s39">And it came the time when she just couldn't do it anymore, and told me that I have to go and live with my father.</span> <span id="s40">So...and she kept my sister.</span> <span id="s41">So my father was in another state of Austria with his new wife.</span> <span id="s42">They worked, uh both as accountants, for a company.</span> <span id="s43">And one day I packed a little suitcase and went on a train and went to see them, you know.</span> <span id="s44">And it was real...not very comfortable for them, because nobody knew that he had a 11 year-old son.</span> <span id="s45">So he actually didn't, uh, look forward to that very much.</span> <span id="s46">But he had no other choice.</span> <span id="s47">And, uh, so that I stayed with them and I went to school there.</span> <span id="s48">I mean, I finished elementary school in Vienna, and my mother let me go to--by the way, here you call it college, [but] it was gymnasium in Vienna--in Vienna for one year.</span> <span id="s49">But I didn't do so good in Latin and Greek.</span> <span id="s50">So when I came to my father, first of all he didn't want to spend the money to go to a college or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">So he said, "I just...you just try to finish high school here, you know, and then we see."</span> <span id="s52">So in the meantime uh they uh asked me to be baptized, because my stepmother was Lutheran.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">And when they married, my father became Lutheran too.</span> <span id="s54">So I got baptized over there when I was 11 or 12, and I had my documents.</span> <span id="s55">Actually, I didn't have anything to do with being Jewish from that age on, you know.</span> <span id="s56">From 11 on.</span> <span id="s57">I went to church; and we had religion outside with the Pastor and so on.</span> <span id="s58">So I stayed with them...uh 11, 12, 13, 14...when I was 14-- 'til I was 14.</span> <span id="s59">So, my father... I, myself, at that uh age, I didn't really know...know what I wanted to be later on, you know.</span> <span id="s60">I thought maybe I'd follow him and go in a school and learn accounting, or whatever.</span> <span id="s61">No he didn't...he didn't want that at all.</span> <span id="s62">He was...he hated his job.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">He was more for nature.</span> <span id="s64">He loved flowers and animals--I mean, not animals, but fish.</span> <span id="s65">He loved fish and flowers.</span> <span id="s66">Cactus, actually.</span> <span id="s67">And he was...when we lived together with him, we had the whole--even before, when he was still married to my real mother, he had the whole living room full with aquariums, you know.</span> <span id="s68">With fish and everything.</span> <span id="s69">And every time he bought a new fish, he hid it behind him and sneaked it in; because my mother didn't want him to spend the money.</span> <span id="s70">They were very expensive, and we didn't hardly have enough money to live on.</span> <span id="s71">So when he was with his other wife, he did the same thing.</span> <span id="s72">He had these aquariums all over the house; and he had the windows covered with flower pots and everything.</span> <span id="s73">And he wanted me not to go in a office...work in an office.</span> <span id="s74">Go out and be in the outside, in nature.</span> <span id="s75">So one day they went on vacation to Germany and they went to all this...the biggest nurseries that there are in Germany.</span> <span id="s76">And finally he found me a place to learn, to begun, in a nursery, in...in Kempten there.</span> <span id="s77">Close to Munich.</span> <span id="s78">You know, in Bavaria.</span> <span id="s79">So but I thought maybe it's alright.</span> <span id="s80">I was real skinny, not strong as anything.</span> <span id="s81">And they came back, picked me up and took me there to that nursery.</span> <span id="s82">Was only the boss, his wife, and they had a daughter which was a little younger than I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: How old were you at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: I was 14.</span> <span id="s85">When you have to learn this job, you have to learn 3 years; and in these 3 years, they gave me a room and board, you know, and no money.</span> <span id="s86">You didn't...you don't get paid for it.</span> <span id="s87">You're learning.</span> <span id="s88">So...but I had to get up at 6:00 in the morning; I was already out there, working.</span> <span id="s89">And I was...I wasn't strong or anything, but I made it, you know.</span> <span id="s90">Carried this big stuff around and worked in the greenhouse, worked outside.</span> <span id="s91">And my boss was...he was an excellent nursery man, a gardener.</span> <span id="s92">He was the best in the city.</span> <span id="s93">But at home, he was the worst.</span> <span id="s94">He beat his wife up every other day.</span> <span id="s95">(Laughing) So this girl and myself, we grew up in that milieu, you know.</span> <span id="s96">And she was, I think, only 2 years younger than I was.</span> <span id="s97">And I had to work 6:00 in the morning, and even some...most of the time until 9:00 in the evening.</span> <span id="s98">And uh when it was dark outside, come in the shed and I had to cut the wood, you know.</span> <span id="s99">And so on.</span> <span id="s100">And then when he came home from drinking, he said, "You can go now."</span> <span id="s101">To sleep, you know.</span> <span id="s102">And then he was full of hard going, he came back at 11:00 back from the...from the...back from the gardens, from the greenhouse.</span> <span id="s103">And he then he went up and hear beating up again and again.</span> <span id="s104">Oh, well, it was terrible.</span> <span id="s105">But I..</span> <span id="s106">.</span> <span id="s107">And then, of course, when I came there, the first few months I was crying every night.</span> <span id="s108">I was homesick.</span> <span id="s109">And my parents in the meantime got transferred back to Vienna from that place where they used to work out in another state.</span> <span id="s110">So they stayed in Vienna.</span> <span id="s111">And uh well, after 3 years he wanted me to stay on and he would pay me.</span> <span id="s112">And I said, "No, I don't want to stay any longer."</span> <span id="s113">In that job, you go from nursery to nursery to learn more and more and more.</span> <span id="s114">So he got me a job in another one about Augsburg.</span> <span id="s115">Augsburg is about three hours by train.</span> <span id="s116">And I stayed there.</span> <span id="s117">That uh was nice, you know.</span> <span id="s118">The people that worked in the nurseries, most of them, they stayed in; they got their bed and their food and everything there.</span> <span id="s119">So I stayed there.</span> <span id="s120">Another couple of years, I moved on to Stuttgart--which is Germany, too.</span> <span id="s121">And I stayed there another couple of years.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">And then--I think it was 1928--I came back to Vienna.</span> <span id="s123">And, uh, my father and my stepmother had a nice apartment off in the suburbs, and I had a room there.</span> <span id="s124">But my work was on the other side of the city.</span> <span id="s125">It was one of the biggest nurseries in Vienna at that time.</span> <span id="s126">So I worked there, but I had to go back and forth.</span> <span id="s127">And after awhile, it was too much; so I got my own room close by about 5 minutes from the nursery.</span> <span id="s128">And I had my own room and everything.</span> <span id="s129">And I made my money there.</span> <span id="s130">And some days, holidays when I was off, I went home.</span> <span id="s131">They did my laundry at home and everything; and over the weekend I stayed home.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">And then I went back to work.</span> <span id="s133">So, that went on from 1928 to 1938.</span> <span id="s134">I was there 10 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: Working in gardens?</span> <span id="s136">A: In the nursery.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: Had you seen your mother during that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: Yah.</span> <span id="s139">My mother was...my mother, my sister were living about...very close by to where I was working.</span> <span id="s140">I saw her off and on, and went out with them sometimes, you know.</span> <span id="s141">I saw her up 'til 1939.</span> <span id="s142">So I worked in the nursery 'til 1938; and then Hitler came and, uh, everything changed.</span> <span id="s143">But I was working.</span> <span id="s144">Nobody knew that I had a Jewish background, because I had my, I went to church and everything.</span> <span id="s145">They all didn't know about it.</span> <span id="s146">And, uh....</span> <span id="s147">Not the people where I used to...where I had my room, and not the people where I worked.</span> <span id="s148">They couldn't believe this.</span> <span id="s149">Then in 1939, the officials out there where I worked came and told the man that I was living with that "You have a Jew up there in the room, you know, living with you."</span> <span id="s150">And the guy--he was an engineer--he was already part of the party there, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">And he said, "What, what are you talking about?</span> <span id="s152">You must be crazy.</span> <span id="s153">Mr. Weihs?</span> <span id="s154">No.</span> <span id="s155">No way!"</span> <span id="s156">So he said, "Well, let's go up and find out."</span> <span id="s157">So they came up there and asked me my background; and I had to say "Yah."</span> <span id="s158">I mean, I myself was already Lutheran for uh so many years; but that didn't help, that doesn't help, you know.</span> <span id="s159">As long as you were Jewish and your parents were Jewish, that's it, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: In '38, did you begin to fear that this might happen to you?</span> <span id="s161">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: In '38, when Hitler came to power, did you fear that was going to happen to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: Well, first we all thought it will be okay, they will leave us alone you know.</span> <span id="s164">And people were screaming already; my mother--my real mother--said, "If he only let us scream with them!"</span> <span id="s165">(Laughing) But he didn't, you know.</span> <span id="s166">I mean, the people of Vienna, they uh were, of course, on his side.</span> <span id="s167">And they hated the Jews for centuries, you know.</span> <span id="s168">They were glad they had a chance to get rid of them.</span> <span id="s169">So these people came up, and said he had to let me go.</span> <span id="s170">I can't stay in his house.</span> <span id="s171">And in the nursery, the guy...they couldn't believe it, you know.</span> <span id="s172">I just, I said, "Well, I am sorry, but I have to quit.</span> <span id="s173">I have to quit."</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: How had they found out?</span> <span id="s175">They had gone and searched your records?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: I guess, yah.</span> <span id="s177">In Austria, your driver's license is not enough.</span> <span id="s178">You know, you got to fill out...and the police wherever, what you leave, every time you move, you have to register.</span> <span id="s179">They know exactly what was going on, you know.</span> <span id="s180">And uh so I had to quit, and...uh the job and the room.</span> <span id="s181">But--I forgot to tell you--in '37 before Hitler came, my father passed away.</span> <span id="s182">He had a gall bladder operation and didn't make it.</span> <span id="s183">So my stepmother was living alone out in the suburbs; and I moved...I lived on with her up to, oh, in '39.</span> <span id="s184">And uh...so I didn't have a job; I didn't have... I mean, the people out there, they didn't like the idea either, that some Jewish people lived there, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: You said in '38 everything changed when Hitler came to power.</span> <span id="s186">Could you tell us some of the things that changed?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: Well, first of all, everybody had to wear the star, you know.</span> <span id="s188">Whoever was Jewish had to wear the star.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: You, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: Yah, sure!</span> <span id="s191">And uh...I mean, most of the time we just covered it up when we could get away with it, you know.</span> <span id="s192">But if they catched you, that was...that would of be terrible, but... Then finally, you know, they closed Jewish stores, they started deporting Jewish... And uh I..</span> <span id="s193">.</span> <span id="s194">I was home, and for a little... Yah, the thing was that I was registered Jewish in the Viennese Kultursgemeinde there.</span> <span id="s195">At the same time, I had my paper that said I am Lutheran, you know.</span> <span id="s196">So I actually two chances to get out of Vienna, either with ...on the Jewish side or on the Lutheran side.</span> <span id="s197">But uh my mother wanted me...tried to get me to Palestine, but it never came to it.</span> <span id="s198">You know, at that time they were smuggling the people out.</span> <span id="s199">My real mother.</span> <span id="s200">And uh on the other side--the Lutheran side--I was registered in...there was a Swedish mission for Jewish people, and I registered there.</span> <span id="s201">So the Jewish uh side wants send me outside Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">There was a farm where they trained youngsters for farming and then send...maybe they could get to Palestine.</span> <span id="s203">So I worked there, I think, one summer.</span> <span id="s204">Milking the cows and cutting the hay; and all that stuff, you know.</span> <span id="s205">(Laughing)</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: A Jewish Agency, HeChalutz?</span> <span id="s207">Which group did this?</span> <span id="s208">Do you know?</span> <span id="s209">A: That was...they called it...was the Kultursgemeinde in Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: So the Kultursgemeinde sent you to the farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: Yah, right.</span> <span id="s212">And then I got a card from the Lutheran people, from the Swedish mission, I should come to an interview.</span> <span id="s213">And they were sending people to Sweden, you know.</span> <span id="s214">They had transports to Sweden.</span> <span id="s215">So I came back from the camp; and I went to this...it was a Pastor that was running the whole thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: Do you know where he was from?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: From the Lutheran church, under the Swedish mission.</span> <span id="s218">And he said, "Well, we'll take all your dates and maybe we can get you uh on a transport.</span> <span id="s219">But right now, there is nothing going.</span> <span id="s220">We have to wait.</span> <span id="s221">In meantime, if you want to, we have a heim [Ger: home] for the elderly--old Jewish people--and maybe 3 houses in Vienna."</span> <span id="s222">They bought a big estate and with little rooms, and they had the people staying there.</span> <span id="s223">"If you want to, you could go out there and work for us."</span> <span id="s224">They had a huge garden to take care of, you know.</span> <span id="s225">"And you could work there 'til we have a chance to get you on a train, you know, out."</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: And who ran this?</span> <span id="s227">Who ran this place?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: It was a Swedish Deaconess, she was connected with that Swedish mission from Stockholm, and she was running that home for the elderly.</span> <span id="s229">So I went there, and I got my room.</span> <span id="s230">And there was a girl there that also worked to clean the rooms, and have everything help in the kitchen; and she became my wife, you know.</span> <span id="s231">We were the only young ones there.</span> <span id="s232">So we worked and worked, and went out together.</span> <span id="s233">And finally, we got engaged.</span> <span id="s234">She came from Vienna, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Her parents had a different story.</span> <span id="s236">Her mother was Catholic.</span> <span id="s237">Her father was Jewish.</span> <span id="s238">The Swedish mission people baptized her Lutheran...(laughing) in 1938, I think it was.</span> <span id="s239">So she was what they then...they called "Mischlinge."</span> <span id="s240">Half this and half that.</span> <span id="s241">So they promised her, too, she could get a chance to go to Sweden.</span> <span id="s242">And in the meantime, she took that job out there.</span> <span id="s243">So we worked together.</span> <span id="s244">She made up all the beds in the morning and this, and helped with the water; every morning have to carry up in the morning.</span> <span id="s245">And then I worked in the garden there.</span> <span id="s246">They had fruit trees, and they were huge.</span> <span id="s247">And they had all these nice old people there, and we always entertained them.</span> <span id="s248">And then I was the one that had to go down in the village and always get the food.</span> <span id="s249">And we had cards, you know, take up for so much butter, so much meat, for so much this.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: Ration cards?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s252">And I had a backpack and a bicycle.</span> <span id="s253">So I was going into the city, buying everything, come back and bring the food.</span> <span id="s254">Up to the time where the villagers said, "No, he can't come anymore.</span> <span id="s255">He is Jewish.</span> <span id="s256">He can't come anymore.</span> <span id="s257">We don't want him here."</span> <span id="s258">I mean, the people that run the stores, they wanted me, you know.</span> <span id="s259">They were good with us.</span> <span id="s260">But Mayor and all these people, they...they were strong Nazi and they didn't want that.</span> <span id="s261">So the Swedish sister, the Deaconess, had to go and do the job, with the shopping and all that stuff.</span> <span id="s262">So that went on.</span> <span id="s263">So in the meantime, we got engaged.</span> <span id="s264">It was uh '39.</span> <span id="s265">I came...I met her--my wife--in August '39, when I came working there.</span> <span id="s266">And we stayed there...'40,'41.</span> <span id="s267">Two years.</span> <span id="s268">And her father was with us.</span> <span id="s269">He had to leave his wife; otherwise, she would lose the apartment in Vienna, you know.</span> <span id="s270">My wife's father.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: He was Jewish and the mother was Catholic?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: He was Jewish, and the mother was Catholic.</span> <span id="s273">So the mother could keep the apartment; and even my future wife, she could have stayed with her mother.</span> <span id="s274">But she went with her father.</span> <span id="s275">And uh...so finally we got engaged.</span> <span id="s276">And in 1941, they...uh people said it has to be closed.</span> <span id="s277">The whole thing, all the people had to go out in the village.</span> <span id="s278">They closed down the home.</span> <span id="s279">And the Swedish mission had a huge building in Vienna itself, you know, where they had apartments and offices and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s280">All of the empty spaces, they made something like a hospital on the ground floor where we all had to move to Vienna.</span> <span id="s281">The old people, they were all in the 80s--70s, 80s.</span> <span id="s282">They had women, most of them there.</span> <span id="s283">And someone of them had to be in bed; and some of them got apartments in the house.</span> <span id="s284">And uh we still were taking care of them; and there was...uh each apartment had its own uh stove.</span> <span id="s285">I had carry the coal up there and take care of these people.</span> <span id="s286">And we fed them there too.</span> <span id="s287">We had a kitchen where they had cooked; and they was all supplied from Sweden, the food, you know.</span> <span id="s288">Okay, so then came 1940, then came spring of '42.</span> <span id="s289">In Spring of '42, there was another organization from Holland.</span> <span id="s290">And this...they were helping people that got evacuated to pack and go to.</span> <span id="s291">There was one school that was just for people to get ready there and for the train to go.</span> <span id="s292">So in order to stay a little longer...and they said if I help them I could probably be protected a little more.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">So we had to go out with the German soldiers to Jewish homes in the night, you know, make the people pack--they at least who is going to go--and get ready and help them 'til the truck came and then loaded them up.</span> <span id="s294">And, of course, there were terrible situations, you know.</span> <span id="s295">The children started crying.</span> <span id="s296">And the children were not home one night.</span> <span id="s297">We were sitting through the morning one night, and they insisted the kid has go with them; and we waited with the Gestapo there.</span> <span id="s298">And I did this for another year while my wife was still in that house with the mission.</span> <span id="s299">And then...</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: Before you go to "and then...," back up a little, please.</span> <span id="s301">Tell us about...tell us the name of this organization.</span> <span id="s302">Tell us how it worked within...you said the Germans really controlled it.</span> <span id="s303">Tell us about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: The Germans what?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: You said the Germans really controlled this, but it was a Dutch organization.</span> <span id="s306">What was the name of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: The Germans just let them do it, you know.</span> <span id="s308">One was a Swedish organization, a Swedish mission; and the other one was Dutch.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: What was it called?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: And they were called Guildemester.</span> <span id="s311">They brought food and they fed the people and helped them with clothes, and so.</span> <span id="s312">But they all had to be closed uh in 19...in the spring of 1942.</span> <span id="s313">And finally, we all had to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: Where?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: From Vienna.</span> <span id="s316">So they took us in this school, where everybody gets ready for transporting.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">There was uh...but my wife and her father were still in Vienna; but myself and our friends, mostly men, we had to leave Vienna.</span> <span id="s318">And...with a suitcase.</span> <span id="s319">And they took us to Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: What did they tell you?</span> <span id="s321">How did they tell you that you had to leave and why?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: Well, they came...they came one day and said, "You have to be on this and this date there and there."</span> <span id="s323">And that's it, you know.</span> <span id="s324">There was not an invitation.</span> <span id="s325">It was just, "Do it, or else!"</span> <span id="s326">So we were all put on a train, and went to a city was called Theresienstadt [NB: TerezÃ­n].</span></p> <p><span id="s327">You probably heared about that.</span> <span id="s328">That was old military city, with kasernes [Ger: "barracks"].</span> <span id="s329">There were no more soldiers; and it was made up like a ghetto, you know.</span> <span id="s330">People came from all over the places.</span> <span id="s331">And the men were living in one of these big houses.</span> <span id="s332">The women, the others.</span> <span id="s333">And during the day, they worked...we worked on the railroad; unloading the coal, whatever came for the ghetto.</span> <span id="s334">And some of them they had their own locker, lumber shops, and everything.</span> <span id="s335">It was like a..</span> <span id="s336">.</span> <span id="s337">like a city by itself, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: Had you heard of it before?</span> <span id="s339">Did you know when you were going there what it was like?</span> <span id="s340">A: Yah.</span> <span id="s341">No, we didn't know what it was like.</span> <span id="s342">We hear about it, that there is a ghetto in Czechoslovakia, but we didn't know what it was about.</span> <span id="s343">We had our own money, you know, own stores and everything like a..</span> <span id="s344">.</span> <span id="s345">like Columbia here, you know.</span> <span id="s346">Everything was wants.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: How did you live?</span> <span id="s348">Tell us about, you talked about having money and going to a store.</span> <span id="s349">What kind of stores were you in?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: Well, I mean the money didn't mean nothing because everything was, you could only get bread or this or that, in rationed.</span> <span id="s351">Everything was rationed, you know.</span> <span id="s352">And uh...then later on, we were allowed to get packages from home, which was something.</span> <span id="s353">We had big kitchens where cooking and where we could eat for dinner, for lunch and dinner, you know.</span> <span id="s354">But uh it was like a black market afterwards, you know.</span> <span id="s355">The Czechoslovakian people, the people that worked on the railroad, they sold you uh cigarettes and they smuggled out our letters home.</span> <span id="s356">And uh a lot of them were really with us, instead of against us.</span> <span id="s357">So we struggled through; and uh it was not too bad actually.</span> <span id="s358">The old people, after a few weeks, they were all gone.</span> <span id="s359">They died.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: Of illness or degradation?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: Of malnutrition and diarrhea, and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s362">They just, they just...you know, they were laying on the floors, and they just couldn't make it.</span> <span id="s363">And the food, they didn't get, they didn't get too much.</span> <span id="s364">But we were still young and we got, later on we got help from home, you know, with bread and stuff like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: Was your wife with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: No.</span> <span id="s367">My wife was still in Vienna.</span> <span id="s368">I was there in early '42.</span> <span id="s369">And then they told them in Vienna, they told, "You can join your people.</span> <span id="s370">And this is like a working place where you can be.</span> <span id="s371">And uh you can be with your fiancÃ©, with your husband, with your father, whatever."</span> <span id="s372">So what did she do?</span> <span id="s373">Instead of staying with her mother, her father had to go.</span> <span id="s374">So she went with her father, and came a half a year later.</span> <span id="s375">And I am standing there shovelling the coal off the...on the railroad, and where they coming out.</span> <span id="s376">They coming out from the train.</span> <span id="s377">And I said that and I see them close there; and I said, "Why didn't you stay with your mother?"</span> <span id="s378">"No, I want to be with you and with my father."</span> <span id="s379">So we stayed together for another, I think, another half year or almost a year.</span> <span id="s380">And we were living separate, but we could see each during the...just normally.</span> <span id="s381">We even got married there.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: Describe that for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: We had our own Mayor and everything.</span> <span id="s384">Q: Did you elect him?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: Yah, the people elect him.</span> <span id="s386">And then uh I mean there were a lot of people come up from the Kultursgemeinde that came with us.</span> <span id="s387">So they took over right away.</span> <span id="s388">And so they had uh ...and I don't know how it was, we...they had the nicest dresses you could buy there; you know, on the black market, or something.</span> <span id="s389">I can't even remember how it worked.</span> <span id="s390">We were really good dressed, and we had our friends.</span> <span id="s391">And we went...she went from her house and I from my house to get married there.</span> <span id="s392">And I went down the street to that house and there was a alarm, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: Watch tower?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: A air alarm.</span> <span id="s395">So we both, I had to duck in the house somewhere, and she had to duck.</span> <span id="s396">When the alarm was over, we made.</span> <span id="s397">It was like a real ceremony there, you know.</span> <span id="s398">And then we had...there was a cafÃ© in the ghetto, and we and our friends went there and celebrated.</span> <span id="s399">And everything seemed to look like normal.</span> <span id="s400">I mean, everything that we brought in our luggage uh was confiscated, you know.</span> <span id="s401">They had big uh buildings where they stored all the clothes and all the shoes and all this...the jewelry.</span> <span id="s402">It all was gone.</span> <span id="s403">But we had ...we could--I don't know how it was--we still could buy things to... There were seamstresses, and we made...made dresses and so.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: It wasn't like a country club.</span> <span id="s405">I mean, there were guards...?</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: Yah, there were guards.</span> <span id="s407">Sure.</span> <span id="s408">We were all...when we went off to the railroad to get the stuff, there was always soldiers with us.</span> <span id="s409">And in the streets.</span> <span id="s410">And there was a SS commander there, you know.</span> <span id="s411">So anyway, it was, uh, fall of '42.</span> <span id="s412">And they came and said, "So and so many men have to go to Germany."</span> <span id="s413">And they had places where they should work, and they need them.</span> <span id="s414">And then they just called our names.</span> <span id="s415">And whoever they wanted.</span> <span id="s416">And gathered us up; and we had to say goodbye to everybody.</span> <span id="s417">My wife was still there.</span> <span id="s418">Her father was still there.</span> <span id="s419">I had to leave them.</span> <span id="s420">And we went on a train.</span> <span id="s421">And the funny thing was, when we went on the train, he said we go to Germany but we went through Vienna.</span> <span id="s422">We looking out the...this windows, and here we are in Vienna.</span> <span id="s423">If we just could jump out, we would be home again, you know.</span> <span id="s424">But we couldn't.</span> <span id="s425">So from...from Austria, they went back and went up to Poland, and ended up in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: Just a second.</span> <span id="s427">Tell me...take a little longer to describe the train trip to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s428">What kind of a train were you in?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: Well, it was what you call the box cars, you know.</span> <span id="s430">Where you usually transport cows or whatever, you know.</span> <span id="s431">We had a little straw in there, and they locked them up from the outside.</span> <span id="s432">And uh all of us, we got a piece of bread when we got in the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: What was it like?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: It was terrible.</span> <span id="s435">Because it was a lot of people in there, hot; some of them started crying, some of them screaming, some of them fainting.</span> <span id="s436">But, anyway, we made it to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s437">We came there in middle in the night.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: Did you know what that meant?</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: No, we didn't have no idea at the time, you know.</span> <span id="s440">Anyway, we...was a whole train full of cars...uh, railroad cars.</span> <span id="s441">And the soldiers and the lights and the captain--or whatever was the officer standing there--like they say, left, right, left, right.</span> <span id="s442">That's how we had all to jump down, in rows of six, and march in front of him.</span> <span id="s443">And uh we were a group of people that knew each other from Vienna for so long, we...we always stick together.</span> <span id="s444">I had my friend and his wife and her two brothers.</span> <span id="s445">One was I think 12 and one was 16.</span> <span id="s446">So we came in, to that right for him; and that little brother was already...we never saw him again, you know.</span> <span id="s447">And the rest of us went in the camp.</span> <span id="s448">And the ones that were actually the worst were the Polish Jews that the SS put in charge of this barracks, you know.</span> <span id="s449">They were hitting us and screaming.</span> <span id="s450">They were worse than the Germans for a while, you know.</span> <span id="s451">So we, first of all, we had to go in these barracks, and the next thing was: "Take everything off.</span> <span id="s452">Take a shower."</span> <span id="s453">And then they gave us this striped shirt and pants coming out.</span> <span id="s454">You had to go to the barber, cut all your hair off, and then you came out.</span> <span id="s455">And when we came out I said to my friend, "Where is uh this guy?"</span> <span id="s456">And he said, "He is right here behind you."</span> <span id="s457">We didn't recognize each other anymore, you know.</span> <span id="s458">All the hair was gone.</span> <span id="s459">And the uniform.</span> <span id="s460">So they put us together in these barracks and that was the first couple of days.</span> <span id="s461">When it was time to get out of the barrack, we made a..</span> <span id="s462">.</span> <span id="s463">there were about 50 and they stood one close to the other one in a circle and we were going just like this just to keep ourselves warm, you know, all together.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">And we saw the chimneys and everything; but we didn't really, the first time, know what was going on.</span> <span id="s465">Until we found out, we didn't get this little boy with us any more, and so, and then the other ones told us all these people go into the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s466">So a couple of days later, what happened?</span> <span id="s467">All the women came.</span> <span id="s468">They told them in Theresienstadt, "You can join your husbands or fathers.</span> <span id="s469">They working there in Germany.</span> <span id="s470">You can join them and it will be just like here."</span> <span id="s471">My wife was among the first to go.</span> <span id="s472">Again, and her girlfriend, you know.</span> <span id="s473">So one day, everything was fenced.</span> <span id="s474">We saw them a little bit across from us.</span> <span id="s475">No hair.</span> <span id="s476">Just like us.</span> <span id="s477">That was the last time we saw each other, you know.</span> <span id="s478">And we...a little group of us, were...I don't know, we were just lucky.</span> <span id="s479">They were looking for men to work in another labor camp.</span> <span id="s480">They didn't give us...even give us any numbers.</span> <span id="s481">I think it was only a week that we stayed there.And then they, uh, packed us up again in the trains and took us to...I remember now what the city was, next to Dachau.</span> <span id="s482">It was Kaufering.Kaufering was the city, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">And there was a uh labor camp, and that is where they took us.</span> <span id="s484">So we didn't know where our wives were anymore.</span> <span id="s485">We just got out of Auchwitz in between a week or two weeks, something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: What was the basis for selection, do you know?</span> <span id="s487">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: What was the basis for the selection?</span> <span id="s489">Why did they choose you for that?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: Well, they choose us, I guess, by the strength of the bodies, you know.</span> <span id="s491">That people they could work, but I can't even remember what they put us to work.</span> <span id="s492">I know where I worked.</span> <span id="s493">Luck again: I worked out in the fields to bring in the potatoes and the cabbage and all that stuff.</span> <span id="s494">Some of them worked in the camp.</span> <span id="s495">Some of them worked in close-by factories, I think.</span> <span id="s496">And there were all men only, in that camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: Old men?</span> <span id="s498">Oh, all men.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: All men.</span> <span id="s500">No...no woman.</span> <span id="s501">So we--our group of friends--we stick together again.</span> <span id="s502">My friend was assigned to the kitchen, and so he could once awhile putting something to eat.</span> <span id="s503">We had this little barracks.</span> <span id="s504">You know this was, was a roof of grass, covered with grass; then you go a few steps down, the door, and there is the wood, and you lay on it... on a blanket, on this wooden...</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: Platforms?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: ...platforms, yah.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: How many people in a barrack?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: Oh, I guess we must have been 40 in a barrack, at least.</span> <span id="s509">One of them...we were not long there, and one of them hanged himself.</span> <span id="s510">In the morning we waked up, and the guy was 1 E.g., in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">2 Subcamp of Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">hanging next to me.</span> <span id="s513">He couldn't stand it any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: Did that happen a lot?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: Well, I guess.</span> <span id="s516">Now what happened a lot was--what I never could understand--that friends of mine--6 feet tall, 200 pounds, really strong guys--they died away like flies.</span> <span id="s517">And we were just medium, not...not really strong.</span> <span id="s518">We just made it.</span> <span id="s519">My friend was in the hospital, I think, 2 or 3 days; then he came out and never again.</span> <span id="s520">But some other ones from our group, they just...you know, diarrhea came and...</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: Were you starved?</span> <span id="s522">The diet?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: No, we didn't have much to eat.</span> <span id="s524">We had cabbage soup, you know, and the bread... Almost nothing.</span> <span id="s525">But like me, I was out in the fields and we had these big coats.</span> <span id="s526">It was...it was fall.</span> <span id="s527">It was cold.</span> <span id="s528">We had a big coat, and the coat had big pockets inside.</span> <span id="s529">I put the potatoes in there, you know.</span> <span id="s530">And we came home--the soldiers already knew what we were doing, I think.</span> <span id="s531">And each barracks had a little stove where we could make a fire.</span> <span id="s532">And put the potatoes in the ashes.</span> <span id="s533">And when everything was quiet, around 11 or 12 at night, we started eating the potatoes.</span> <span id="s534">I guess, and somehow... And cabbage.</span> <span id="s535">Somehow, that kept us going I think.</span> <span id="s536">And the other guys, if... As soon as you got sick, you were done.</span> <span id="s537">Got very diarhea, or whatever it was.</span> <span id="s538">There were only skeletons anymore.</span> <span id="s539">And it was in the winter then, in November.</span> <span id="s540">And they made us, we were...we had to go out with a 2 wheeler you know.</span> <span id="s541">We had to pack all these dead bodies on the 2 wheeler.</span> <span id="s542">And we see my friend here, my friend here.</span> <span id="s543">I mean, up here, they were there.</span> <span id="s544">Just skeletons.</span> <span id="s545">Frozen stiff, you know.</span> <span id="s546">It was cold at that time.</span> <span id="s547">No clothes, nothing on.</span> <span id="s548">So we had to put them on the 2 wheeler, go out in the fields with the soldier, dig the holes, and just put them in there.</span> <span id="s549">Cover them up.</span> <span id="s550">And then later on, we didn't even have anymore uh...uh room.</span> <span id="s551">We had to carry them to another camp to be buried there or burned, I don't know.</span> <span id="s552">Anyway, we had one guy that was, on his own free will, went to another camp to work.</span> <span id="s553">And then he came with a troop of people back; and he was...we had to empty these cars, and they were on this straw in there.</span> <span id="s554">And some of the guys were laying dead and the other ones hardly could get up off the car.</span> <span id="s555">And when they came to the camp, I'll never forget that.</span> <span id="s556">They came like ghosts, you know, swaying like this, only a little littler then.</span> <span id="s557">A whole group of people looking at us.</span> <span id="s558">And fall.</span> <span id="s559">Then they came in, and I had to give them cups of water.</span> <span id="s560">They went on their knees crawling to us, that cup of water.</span> <span id="s561">And then they fed them.</span> <span id="s562">Most of them, I think, didn't make it.</span> <span id="s563">And then we had uh people come in.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">And we had people come in from all over, from France and everywhere.</span> <span id="s565">And then the Red Cross was sending uh packages.</span> <span id="s566">And uh they came the packages and some broke open; and they had dried beans and peas in there.</span> <span id="s567">And these guys were storming against this stuff, eating this dried...dried beans.</span> <span id="s568">A lot of them ate grass, you know.</span> <span id="s569">From the barracks, they ate the grass.</span> <span id="s570">I actually never got in that bad a situation.</span> <span id="s571">I always had my potatoes and soup; and then we made it that way.</span> <span id="s572">Anyway.</span> <span id="s573">And next to our camp, was a railway going from Kaufering to Dachau, where the Germans transported their troops and material and everything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: Before you tell us about that, we are going to have to change tape.</span> <span id="s575">A: Oh!</span> <span id="s576">I am going too long already.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: It will only take a moment.</span> <span id="s578">A: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s580">TAPE #2</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: We were not allowed to cook.</span> <span id="s582">There were some other...there were bread and stuff in there.</span> <span id="s583">I don't what happened, what actually was in there, all of it.</span> <span id="s584">But I know it spilled, and these guys were grabbing and putting that stuff in their mouths.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: We are rolling again.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: Oh, okay.</span> <span id="s587">So, then it was...that went on 'til, oh, spring of '45.</span> <span id="s588">I was there 'til spring of '45.</span> <span id="s589">Q: Kaufering?</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: In Kaufering.</span> <span id="s591">After...then one day, they said we have to evacuate.</span> <span id="s592">The camp is going to be closed, and they going to take us to Dachau.</span> <span id="s593">So we got our clothes, we didn't have anything else, and we got our piece of bread, and we started marching.</span> <span id="s594">It was, I think, it was two days, we should have marched.</span> <span id="s595">We...we marched about 2 hours.</span> <span id="s596">And it was hill up; and you could see from the hill down to the camp, and all was uh...the whole thing went up in flames.</span> <span id="s597">You know, the American bombers bombed the camp plus the railroad.</span> <span id="s598">They were waiting to cut off the railroad bridge from there to Munich, so the Germans couldn't transport their stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">And they must have known all the time that there was a camp, a labor camp there.</span> <span id="s600">Otherwise, they never touched it.</span> <span id="s601">They flew over us a lot of times.</span> <span id="s602">And that moment we went out, two hours later, everything went up in flames.</span> <span id="s603">So we started marching through the woods towards Dachau.</span> <span id="s604">In the meantime, the soldiers that were supposed to watch us...half of them disappeared.</span> <span id="s605">It was almost May, it was April '45.</span> <span id="s606">And the other ones took everything off, their medals and signs.</span> <span id="s607">And nobody paid any attention to us.</span> <span id="s608">So we were marching in a long line.</span> <span id="s609">And we were a group of my friends and a couple of other ones.</span> <span id="s610">His cousin and a couple of other ones.</span> <span id="s611">He said, "I don't know.</span> <span id="s612">Maybe we better don't go to Dachau.</span> <span id="s613">I don't know.</span> <span id="s614">They might kill us in the last minute there, you know, before they...before they give up."</span> <span id="s615">So one time in the afternoon, we went along in the line and got a curb where no soldier could actually see us.</span> <span id="s616">And the five of us, I think it was, jumped on the side in the pit and hide...were hiding.</span> <span id="s617">'Til they were out of sight.</span> <span id="s618">Nobody cared how many in the group any more.</span> <span id="s619">So then we got out.</span> <span id="s620">We started marching and uh we didn't know where we were going, how far we are from Dachau.</span> <span id="s621">And we go on that street; here comes a German woman on a bicycle and we said, "What is going on?"</span> <span id="s622">She said, "The Armies are coming.</span> <span id="s623">The Army.</span> <span id="s624">The Army are here."</span> <span id="s625">We said, "Well, that's good."</span> <span id="s626">And we hear shooting.</span> <span id="s627">In the...in the next village we hear still shooting going on.</span> <span id="s628">So we went there towards that village, and we ducked out when the...when they started shooting, and then we come, we came to the middle of the city, of the, of that village.</span> <span id="s629">And here were all the American tanks, the soldiers sitting on the tanks smoking their cigarettes and having a good time.</span> <span id="s630">And then all of the sudden, there came some airplanes and so everybody ducked.</span> <span id="s631">But it was American airplanes, you know.</span> <span id="s632">So what we going to do?</span> <span id="s633">My friend was able to speak a little English.</span> <span id="s634">So they took us to the commandant; and they took us in a hospital.</span> <span id="s635">They thought we have to recover.</span> <span id="s636">We didn't look too bad, but still.</span> <span id="s637">We were laying in that hospital a few hours.</span> <span id="s638">Wounded German soldiers; and we were laying if front of them, and they didn't actually know who we are.</span> <span id="s639">And here comes the nurses.</span> <span id="s640">"Oh," they started crying, "the American soldiers... The end... Too many died already..." And this and this.</span> <span id="s641">And we are in the middle of this German hospital.</span> <span id="s642">That was a terrible situation, you know?</span> <span id="s643">But the nurses were nice to us.</span> <span id="s644">I don't know whether they knew who we are or not.</span> <span id="s645">But anyway, they took care of us.</span> <span id="s646">And we were actually not safe.</span> <span id="s647">We were just resting from the...from the trip from Kaufering to there.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: Can you talk about being in a German hospital.</span> <span id="s649">The Americans put you in a German hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: Yah, they occupied everything then, you know.</span> <span id="s651">But they had 3 German nurses and everything and German wounded soldiers were there, you know.</span> <span id="s652">So we were there, I think, a week or longer.</span> <span id="s653">While we were there, the Americans completely took over the city.</span> <span id="s654">And all the guys that got free from the labor camps, they went down in the basements, opened the wine barrels.</span> <span id="s655">There were that fine wine.</span> <span id="s656">Took all of anything they could eat, you know.</span> <span id="s657">And, actually, we missed the whole thing, you know.</span> <span id="s658">When we came out, everything was organized.</span> <span id="s659">And they were...I think you can say they were looting, as I remember.</span> <span id="s660">The Germans were really scared then.</span> <span id="s661">The people that lived there.</span> <span id="s662">And there was a whole American outfit there, a battalion or whatever it was, you know.</span> <span id="s663">And when we came out, [they] gave us...they put us in a school.</span> <span id="s664">And there was one...you can call it a restaurant--not a restaurant, but a inn or something--where we could go and eat...eat lunch and dinner.</span> <span id="s665">They even had dance in the evening.</span> <span id="s666">And they made it as nice as possible for us, you know.</span> <span id="s667">'Til end of May or June.</span> <span id="s668">And then they had transportation to Munich for us.</span> <span id="s669">And there you could stay again; and where were you supposed to...want to go home, and you could go with the train home.</span> <span id="s670">There was no need for money or anything.</span> <span id="s671">I don't know, I was hanging around there a long time.</span> <span id="s672">I had a friend...I met a guy there.</span> <span id="s673">Uh, he was from Spain.</span> <span id="s674">Another "inmate," so to speak.</span> <span id="s675">And we...I didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s676">Should I go back to Vienna or...?</span></p> <p><span id="s677">He said he is going to go to Spain, and I should go with him and live.</span> <span id="s678">And I didn't know what...what happened to my wife.</span> <span id="s679">I had no idea.</span> <span id="s680">But then my friends, they all went back to Vienna.</span> <span id="s681">So I took a..</span> <span id="s682">.</span> <span id="s683">went on a train, went back too.</span> <span id="s684">And I came to my stepmother's apartment; and the owner of the house wanted her to move out.</span> <span id="s685">Because one part of the...of the floor was his, and the other part was hers; and he wanted the whole thing together again.</span> <span id="s686">So she wanted me to stay with her as long as I..</span> <span id="s687">.</span> <span id="s688">as a captive, from... As I was living with her, he couldn't do anything about evacuating her or telling her to get out.</span> <span id="s689">But in the meantime, I found out that my wife was with her mother in a little city close by of Vienna.</span> <span id="s690">It's about 2 hour drive back by train to Vienna, uh from Vienna to Baden.</span> <span id="s691">It's called Baden-by-Vienna.</span> <span id="s692">So I said, "Well, I can't just stay here.</span> <span id="s693">I have to see where my wife is."</span> <span id="s694">At that time, my stepmother and my wife didn't get along too good.</span> <span id="s695">In the first place, my stepmother didn't want me to marry her.</span> <span id="s696">And when this was all done...I mean, it was in Theresienstadt when we got married, but that was nothing official.</span> <span id="s697">It was not...the state didn't recognize that marriage, you know.</span> <span id="s698">But anyway, I said to her I had to look her [NB: his wife] up.</span> <span id="s699">So I went to Baden.</span> <span id="s700">That there was a small city close to Vienna.</span> <span id="s701">Actually, it is not so small.</span> <span id="s702">The people come there from all over the world.</span> <span id="s703">They have this thermal baths.</span> <span id="s704">And she was there in her mother's sister's house, they were living.</span> <span id="s705">And her mother's sister was living in another city.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">They had their own house there.</span> <span id="s707">So she was living there.</span> <span id="s708">And I had a uh piece of paper from the Russians, that I was released from Dachau and so, in Russian.</span> <span id="s709">I think I gave it to the...; last time, I sent it.</span> <span id="s710">So the Russians were actually in that sector of Austria, patrolling the city of Baden, you know.</span> <span id="s711">It was in four parts.</span> <span id="s712">It was Aus...Russians, English, French and, uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: Americans.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A: Yah, Americans.</span> <span id="s715">So I showed him this on the street.</span> <span id="s716">He let me go.</span> <span id="s717">So I went up there.</span> <span id="s718">And my mother-in-law...my wife wasn't there.</span> <span id="s719">And she was scared.</span> <span id="s720">She didn't even want to let me in, because I was looking different.</span> <span id="s721">She said.</span> <span id="s722">"Is it really you?"</span> <span id="s723">She looked up from the window outside, "Is it really you?"</span> <span id="s724">"Yes, [Eva (ph)], let me in."</span> <span id="s725">Finally, she got convinced that it's me.</span> <span id="s726">She let me in.</span> <span id="s727">And then my wife came in the evening.</span> <span id="s728">And she looked, of course... Her hair was only that long.</span> <span id="s729">And so we were together again.</span> <span id="s730">But food!</span> <span id="s731">There was no food.</span> <span id="s732">We had beans and bread everyday.</span> <span id="s733">There was no food to get.</span> <span id="s734">Hard to get.</span> <span id="s735">And she looked...she was very skinny.</span> <span id="s736">I mean, while I was getting out of that--the city where I was staying next to Dachau was FÃ¼rstenfeldbruck, I told you that.</span> <span id="s737">That was an air base, a former German air base.</span> <span id="s738">And she was...when she left Auschwitz...they took her away from Auchwitz, they took her to Czechoslovakia in a camp.</span> <span id="s739">Belsen, I think.So with her girl friend, she was there.</span> <span id="s740">And she was miserable there.</span> <span id="s741">She almost died.</span> <span id="s742">She...they lost her shoes.</span> <span id="s743">And it was cold, they had to march in the snow.</span> <span id="s744">They had a factory where these girls had to work.</span> <span id="s745">They had for hardly to eat.</span> <span id="s746">She had only 2 holes here, a big hole here.</span> <span id="s747">But she had one good thing.</span> <span id="s748">Her cheeks were always red, whether she was sick or well, or what.</span> <span id="s749">So when the doctor was patrolling the barracks and she was laying there, her friends said, "No, she is alright.</span> <span id="s750">She is feeling okay.</span> <span id="s751">She's just a little tired or something."</span> <span id="s752">So they let her go.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Otherwise, if you were a little sick there, they took you away.</span> <span id="s754">So she made it.</span> <span id="s755">And when it came to May '45, and when the camp was open, she came to Vienna on a train was full of Russian soldiers.</span> <span id="s756">But she said they were real nice, didn't do anything to them.</span> <span id="s757">Probably they looked too ugly, didn't want to do anything to them.</span> <span id="s758">(Laughing) And she went home and stayed with her mother.</span> <span id="s759">So when I came, we were together again.</span> <span id="s760">But in Vienna--it was '45-- it was not pleasant.</span> <span id="s761">It was demolished very much from the bombs, you know.</span> <span id="s762">So everything was...half of Vienna was in ruins except the steeple, churches and some museums, stuff they didn't touch.</span> <span id="s763">The [Vienna State] Opera even got a little bombed.</span> <span id="s764">And the apartment where her mother was living in Vienna--when we got back, one wall of the house was gone.</span> <span id="s765">It was open.</span> <span id="s766">And the living room had a piano there standing, and her mother saw this.</span> <span id="s767">And this piano was just right on the wall ready to fall down.</span> <span id="s768">But, you know, they repaired everything, of course.</span> <span id="s769">It looks beautiful now.</span> <span id="s770">But uh we couldn't stay there so that's why she was in that uh city of Baden.</span> <span id="s771">That's why she was staying there.</span> <span id="s772">But the two of us...in '46, the Swedish Mission came back.</span> <span id="s773">They got their house back and uh...uh they opened up kitchens for the school children all over Vienna for lunch.</span> <span id="s774">They feed the children.</span> <span id="s775">And the simplest part of the whole thing were all the people were living was that house that the mission owned.</span> <span id="s776">And they took over one...one big...used to be uh... Not a castle; was a big thing--Luxemburg, Schloss Luxemburg it was called.</span> <span id="s777">They used it as magazines [NB: warehouse] for storing the 3 Bertgen-Belsen is in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">food and everything.</span> <span id="s779">And so they took us.</span> <span id="s780">We went back to them.</span> <span id="s781">We got an apartment upstairs.</span> <span id="s782">I was taking care of the whole house as far as the cellar where the food was.</span> <span id="s783">I had to bring the food to the kitchen; they had a huge kitchen there and everything.</span> <span id="s784">Taking care of the...I had to...they had...like they had this little, they had this stoves.</span> <span id="s785">But not, you know, the big ones made out of uh, of uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: Tiles?</span></p> <p><span id="s787">A: Tiles.</span> <span id="s788">Yah.</span> <span id="s789">So I had to serve all these people with this coal from down the .</span> <span id="s790">They had the big thing out behind, going up and down there, didn't have an elevator there.</span> <span id="s791">And so we were living with them.</span> <span id="s792">We had our food, every night we invited somebody else of our friends to come for dinner; because in Vienna there was...was so terrible then.</span> <span id="s793">Nobody had something to eat.</span> <span id="s794">We had the food of... they had plenty of everything, like in peace time, yah.</span> <span id="s795">So we stayed with them for quite a while.</span> <span id="s796">Then my wife got a job working in the...in the bank where she used to work before she was evacuated.</span> <span id="s797">And she worked there, and our girl went to nursery school there.</span> <span id="s798">And I was working in the house still with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: In a couple of minutes: you mentioned your girl went to nursery school.</span> <span id="s800">Talk about when the baby was born.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: When she was born.</span> <span id="s802">In '47.</span> <span id="s803">Yah, '47; when we was still there.</span> <span id="s804">And my wife never forgave me this: I look at the baby, and I said, "My God, we got a little monkey here."</span> <span id="s805">Oh, she was so upset!</span> <span id="s806">(Laughing) She never...she always mentions that.</span> <span id="s807">But now she is a pretty girl.</span> <span id="s808">But um then...

Yah, there was from the mission, from the Swedish Mission, was a office in New York too.</span> <span id="s884">They are all over.</span> <span id="s885">And they made sure that we get our crates and everything.</span> <span id="s886">And so we stayed; I think, we stayed with my mother 2 months.</span> <span id="s887">And I made an application in the Botanic Garden in New York to get a job.</span> <span id="s888">I never got an answer.</span> <span id="s889">I was...I don't know what to do.</span> <span id="s890">And my wife had an aunt in Long Island, in East Hampton, that she knew from Vienna.</span> <span id="s891">Way back.</span> <span id="s892">They were here, her aunt and her uncle were here in the '30's already, you know.</span> <span id="s893">They had a little restaurant, pizza restaurant, in Long Island.</span> <span id="s894">So New York ...we didn't like New York too much.</span> <span id="s895">So my wife said, "Why don't we...?"</span> <span id="s896">And they were calling us on the phone, "Why don't you come over here for a while?"</span> <span id="s897">So we packed up again and went to Long Island, and stayed with her aunt.</span> <span id="s898">She had that restaurant, and we helped her.</span> <span id="s899">Uh, she had... the aunt was staying up til 12:00 or 1:00 in the morning waiting for customers.</span> <span id="s900">She didn't want to close early, because maybe another customer come.</span> <span id="s901">So my wife stayed with her every night 'til late in the morning.</span> <span id="s902">We got our daughter in a kindergarten there.</span> <span id="s903">And I got a job in a place where they homogenized the milk and packed the milk and have it ready for... Where the farmers bring the milk to, and you put it in the cartons like.</span> <span id="s904">And I worked...I had to get up everyday at 3:00 in the morning; and the guy picked me up at 3:30.</span> <span id="s905">I didn't have a car or anything.</span> <span id="s906">Couldn't even drive.</span> <span id="s907">And he took me with him, that he worked there, too.</span> <span id="s908">But we were off at 3:00 in the afternoon or 3:30; and he brought me home again.</span> <span id="s909">So I did this over the winter.</span> <span id="s910">And then our friends, the ones that were living in Washington already for a year, the ones that were writing us, we should come, come, come.</span> <span id="s911">They said, "Come over and maybe we will find something here."</span> <span id="s912">So that was in the spring of '51--no, '52.</span> <span id="s913">'51 became '52.</span> <span id="s914">I went alone.</span> <span id="s915">I said, "Let me just look."</span> <span id="s916">And I went alone.</span> <span id="s917">I slept in their apartment, and this friend of mine was a plate maker.</span> <span id="s918">He worked for a big lithographic company, the printing, and he got me a job in that plant, in the press room.</span> <span id="s919">He was making plates somewhere, and I was in the press where they had these huge presses.</span> <span id="s920">And really, I mean, I got in that union and it paid good, and I worked for them 13 years, 13 years.</span> <span id="s921">In the meantime, in that house where my friend was living, he was living in the basement and the owner of the house had the upstairs.</span> <span id="s922">He was the Maitre d' of the Mayflower Hotel in Washington.</span> <span id="s923">And one day he came and he said, "Why don't you come down and help us out when you are not too busy?"</span> <span id="s924">You know.</span> <span id="s925">I worked only 8:00 to 4:00, or something or 6:00 to 2:00, or something like that, in the printing plant.</span> <span id="s926">So, that is where it started.</span> <span id="s927">So many nights a week I went down there and I took my friend, Bornsmith (ph).</span> <span id="s928">He didn't...he didn't like it.</span> <span id="s929">He never went again.</span> <span id="s930">But I stick... stuck to it.</span> <span id="s931">I was working with the waiter in the bank with the department of the Mayflower another, the same 13 years.</span> <span id="s932">And so I had actually two jobs; because when we came we didn't have no money, no nothing.</span> <span id="s933">We got...when we came in '51, we got a room in a single home with a widow and two kids.</span> <span id="s934">She had a boy and girl.</span> <span id="s935">And we rented the bedroom, the bedroom for us.</span> <span id="s936">We could share the living room, kitchen, and the.</span> <span id="s937">.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">And so that was working out good.</span> <span id="s939">The two girls went together to school; the other girl was a little bit bored.</span> <span id="s940">First my daughter went to kindergarten.</span> <span id="s941">In a half year, she spoke English...like no accent, no nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q: Were you raising her as a Lutheran?</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: Yah, sure.</span> <span id="s944">Yah.</span> <span id="s945">Yah.</span> <span id="s946">We were Lutherans.</span> <span id="s947">I couldn't change that.</span> <span id="s948">And so, my daughter was in the nursing home, we picked her up, my wife.</span> <span id="s949">And then the lady that we lived with, she worked for Safeway; and she got...after the 5 and 10 cent store, she got my wife a job at Safeway.</span> <span id="s950">And she stayed at Safeway 25 years.</span> <span id="s951">Yah.</span> <span id="s952">And then she retired in '78.</span> <span id="s953">And I started working in that printing press in the morning; and in the afternoon...late afternoon, I went to the hotel and was helping there.</span> <span id="s954">So I had actually two jobs, so we saved a little money.</span> <span id="s955">And we stayed with that lady 5 years, here on Forest Glen Road in Maryland.</span> <span id="s956">And after 5 years, we had enough money and we were looking for a house in Wheaton, out in Wheaton.</span> <span id="s957">At that time, I think the house was $12,000 and the down payment was $500.</span> <span id="s958">So we got a house.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">And it was uh...uh 2 bricks, you know.</span> <span id="s960">Two houses together; but it had upstairs with 3 rooms and a nice living room, dining room, kitchen, beautiful yard.</span> <span id="s961">So the cost was $12,000, but I think I paid down $500 and that wasn't enough.</span> <span id="s962">I had to have another second mortgage with the owner, and paid the owner...I don't know, 5 years, $35 a month, or something, you know.</span> <span id="s963">So I was...we had a house, we had no furniture.</span> <span id="s964">So we started buying the furniture, little bit here, little bit there.</span> <span id="s965">And my salary, her salary together, and when the first of the month came, everything was on charge.</span> <span id="s966">They had to be divided so much then and there, so much money here.</span> <span id="s967">So we pay off this stuff in a little while.</span> <span id="s968">And we did it.</span> <span id="s969">We paid off the second mortgage in 5 years.</span> <span id="s970">We stayed there 12 years, in that house; and in the meantime, we put our daughter through college in that house.</span> <span id="s971">When she came back, she didn't want to stay with us anymore.</span> <span id="s972">She got her own apartment with her girl friend.</span> <span id="s973">So we had that big house with the bedrooms, upstairs and everything, and said, "It's too big for us, two of us.</span> <span id="s974">Let's find a small one."</span> <span id="s975">So we find a small one where we are now.</span> <span id="s976">And that was only $19,500 at that time.</span> <span id="s977">I think today it's $80,000, though.</span> <span id="s978">And uh so we sold that house.</span> <span id="s979">We got out $12,000 from that house clear, put it right away there.</span> <span id="s980">And I was always afraid of mortgages, owing here and owing there.</span> <span id="s981">So whatever I could scrap together from savings and so, we paid the house off right away.</span> <span id="s982">And from then on out, it got a lot easier.</span> <span id="s983">And there were only the two of us.</span> <span id="s984">Our daughter was by then...got a job--a social worker--which she still has it.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">Q: Do you talk to her a lot about your experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s986">A: Uh, not too much.</span> <span id="s987">She knows where we were.</span> <span id="s988">But you know more, I think, than she does.</span> <span id="s989">Now.</span> <span id="s990">But she told me all the time, "Write a book.</span> <span id="s991">Write a book.</span> <span id="s992">We want to know what happened."</span> <span id="s993">It's better she don't know, you know.</span> <span id="s994">But anyway, we are out of the woods, you know.</span> <span id="s995">We are both retired.</span> <span id="s996">We get our pension.</span> <span id="s997">We get our social security.</span> <span id="s998">She got her...she got 3 kids: 3 boys.</span> <span id="s999">And she...her husband got a good job with the government; and they have huge house in Silver Spring.</span> <span id="s1000">So everything right now seems to be okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">Q: Congratulations!</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">A: It was a rough time.</span> <span id="s1003">But they say if you want to, you can make it, and we made it.</span> <span id="s1004">Q:</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">A: And can't complain anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Q: Do you ever keep in touch with your mother's family?</span> <span id="s1007">A: My mother's...real mother's family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">A: There is no more anymore.</span> <span id="s1010">My mother died.</span> <span id="s1011">My mother died in Newburg, actually, in the '70s.</span> <span id="s1012">Her parents came from the Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1013">They died.</span> <span id="s1014">Actually, my real grandmother was with us in Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s1015">And she was...she was in the 70s, and she got out.</span> <span id="s1016">She used to live in Paris for a long time after that, after '45.</span> <span id="s1017">But I was...</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">Q: How did she get out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">A: I mean, she...when it was liquidated and the Americans freed them--or the Russians, whoever was there.</span> <span id="s1020">She was still alive, and her daughter died.</span> <span id="s1021">She made it, you know.</span> <span id="s1022">She had a lot of kids.</span> <span id="s1023">And they met in France;
