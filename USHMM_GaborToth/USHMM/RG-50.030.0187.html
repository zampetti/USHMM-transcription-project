me your full name?</span> <span id="s13">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s14">My name is Frank Reiss.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: Where and when were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: I was born April 21st, 1935, in Berlin, Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: Do you have any recollections of any of the events that happened in Berlin?</span> <span id="s18">A: No.</span> <span id="s19">We left Berlin in 1937 for Austria.</span> <span id="s20">We ran to Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: Can you tell us whether places in those events before you can remember anything.</span> <span id="s22">What happened to you and your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: Well, they were supposed to...we wanted to go to the United States and we registered, but the quota was so over-subscribed and in the meantime we had to leave Germany so we left for Austria.</span> <span id="s24">And after the Anschluss, after 1938, my father had a sister in Slovakia where he was born and it was Austria-Hungary at that time.</span> <span id="s25">So we left for Czechoslovakia or Slovakia, the Slovak part of Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s26">And in the meantime my father was trying to arrange that we could leave for the States.</span> <span id="s27">And of course he did not succeed and in the meantime, 1942 came and he was taken to Majdanek.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: Before that happened take us up to that point, what happened to your father and mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: I already...once we reached Slovakia, somewhere around 1940, my mother was already not in the picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: What happened to your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: I found out after the war that she was involved in a..</span> <span id="s32">.</span> <span id="s33">in an underground group that was smuggling people from Poland to the West to safety.</span> <span id="s34">And I found out about it in a very strange way.</span> <span id="s35">There is a psychiatrist in this town, a Doctor Pearl who was involved in the Nuremberg trials as an American psychiatrist, and he is married to a lady who knew my mother from those times, who knew about her underground activities and knew about the whole group that they were caught.</span> <span id="s36">And then I found out from practically the only surviving relative of mine, an Aunt, a sister of my mother, that my mother was in jail in Warsaw and was executed in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s37">But I don't have any other details and I don't have any documents about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">01:03:30</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: Then you and your father...where did you and your father go?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: My father we stayed in Slovakia.</span> <span id="s41">My father, I understand, was quite desperate because, of course, he couldn't find any work and he was practically just waiting for the opportunity still to get out and one day in March or April 1942, he got an invitation to report to the railroad station, that he will be taken to a labor camp.</span> <span id="s42">So the night before that happened, he wrote a note which I have...was given to me after the war, where he authorizes my aunt to hand me over to a Jewish family in that small little town in Slovakia that was supposed to be protected from deportation because they had what was called either the yellow or the white exemption which could have been bought from the Slovak government.</span> <span id="s43">This yellow/white exemption indication that the person is important for the Slovak economy.</span> <span id="s44">This was already ,Czechoslovakia did not exist anymore, the Slovak</span></p> <p><span id="s45">01:05: State, a puppet state put together by Hitler, and Hitler installed the Slovak fascist government.</span> <span id="s46">The head of it was Monsieur Tiso.</span> <span id="s47">This was already the Slovak State.</span> <span id="s48">So when they took my father I still stayed with my aunt.</span> <span id="s49">A few weeks later, they came to take my aunt and her husband and the maid.</span> <span id="s50">They had a maid.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: What was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: Was Agnes.</span> <span id="s53">Agnes Rebunska.</span> <span id="s54">And she woke me up and I remember this...this actually [is] one of the first recollections that I have about this time.</span> <span id="s55">She just sent me out of the house in this little town named Piestany.</span> <span id="s56">And she pointed the direction to me, the neighboring village where her parents lived.</span> <span id="s57">I basically knew that village because she would take me there over the weekends.</span> <span id="s58">So I ran to this village.</span> <span id="s59">On the road somebody picked me up on a bicycle, brought me to her parents, and from there on based on that authorization that my father wrote just before he was taken to Majdanek I was given to this family who had these exemptions, the yellow/white exemptions.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: When Agnes Acnes got you out of there, and this is one of your first recollections, remember how you...what you saw that would be.</span> <span id="s61">Did you have any feelings about it at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: Feelings I don't remember.</span> <span id="s63">I remember thoughts that it seemed to me too far.</span> <span id="s64">The village seemed to me too far, and that I was very relieved when one of the young men from the village who was on his way either to school or to a job in that small town took me on the bicycle, turned around, brought me to the village and handed me over to the parents.</span> <span id="s65">I recall much better when I was then brought to this family.</span> <span id="s66">The name was Pollack.</span> <span id="s67">They knew my father.</span> <span id="s68">And when I arrived there they had a 19 year old son and they asked me to feel at home.</span> <span id="s69">This will be my home.</span> <span id="s70">Incidentally, from this family's balcony I was watching when my father left for the railroad station to report to the labor camp.</span> <span id="s71">They told him that he will go to a small town named Novaki, which was just...I don't know, maybe 25 miles from Piestany.</span> <span id="s72">And I also recall that people were telling him, "Mr. Reiss, don't go.</span> <span id="s73">You are going to be taken somewhere else, not to a labor camp.‚Äù</span> <span id="s74">And he just dismissed this and I remember standing on the balcony and waving to him.</span> <span id="s75">It was the last time I saw him.</span> <span id="s76">And after that I had to go to school.</span> <span id="s77">I was a first grader in the Jewish school which was just</span></p> <p><span id="s78">01:08:30 around the corner from this family's house so that my last recollection of seeing my father...</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: You had no notion that that was the last time you would see your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: No.</span> <span id="s81">No.</span> <span id="s82">Neither did my father, because my father wrote a card which I have at home.</span> <span id="s83">I have it framed at home, smuggled it out of that car, and the card says in German, "We are full of optimism, and we are looking forward to all that's to come and we will stay in Novaki.</span> <span id="s84">And there and then he sends regards to several friends so he did not know, and of course, I had no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: And you're with the Pollack family.</span> <span id="s86">Can you tell us what happened them?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: The Pollack family.</span> <span id="s88">And 6 weeks, maybe 6 weeks later, with this yellow exemption or white exemption disregarded, we went to the first concentration camp which was Zilina, which is about, 100 miles from Piestany and also in northern Slovakia, but it's also very close to the Polish border.</span> <span id="s89">And from there to Auschwitz is a very short distance.</span> <span id="s90">I don't know...maybe a hundred miles maybe, a little bit more, but certainly not much more.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">There I already recall that we were very cramped in this camp.</span> <span id="s92">And I was 7 and I was looking at the cattle cars being filled with people and I remember I always enjoyed trains.</span> <span id="s93">A train ride was always something I was looking forward to...incidentally to this day.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">And I was just waiting...'when will our turn come,' so I did not view it as something negative.</span> <span id="s95">I wanted to take a train ride.</span> <span id="s96">I got different feelings when I saw that they closed the cattle cars and the train was just standing there and some people were screaming for water.</span> <span id="s97">And also what frightened me, there wasn't...there wasn't one German.</span> <span id="s98">This was all administered by the Slovaks, by the so called Hlinka guard.</span> <span id="s99">Was the fascist uniformed members of the Hlinka party.</span> <span id="s100">And one day I was wondering through this camp.</span> <span id="s101">There were wooden barracks and one of these Hlinka guards...I don't know whether they took pity on me.</span> <span id="s102">I don't know what I looked like.</span> <span id="s103">But he invited me into a large warehouse and there were all these knapsacks and there was food, canned food.</span> <span id="s104">Sardines.</span> <span id="s105">And there were lemons I remember.</span> <span id="s106">And he said, "Take what you want.‚Äù</span> <span id="s107">And I was...I believed quite a street smart kid, so I put some string around my pants and I stuffed the pants with all kinds of foods, cans, sardines.</span> <span id="s108">And I brought it to the barrack where we were staying.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">And I remember a great feeling of satisfaction because I distributed food.</span> <span id="s110">There wasn't starvation really there.</span> <span id="s111">We were fed.</span> <span id="s112">I believe twice a day we were getting some soup.</span> <span id="s113">And this was basically just a transit camp, a camp where people arrived, loaded in the cattle cars and sent on.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: How did you get out of there?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: Well, this man...this Pollack was a dentist in Piestany.</span> <span id="s116">He had a brother named Arthur.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Arthur was in Bratislava which is the capital of Slovakia and he was by profession a printer and he had a very influential friend and professional colleague from the printing business whose name was Shajno Mach (ph.).</span> <span id="s118">He was a minister of interior in the fascist government of Monsignor Tiso in charge of solving the Jewish question of Slovakia.</span> <span id="s119">And Shajno Mach and Arthur Pollack were friends, drinking friends, card playing friends, fellow printers.</span> <span id="s120">And Arthur was sort of a bon vivant as a I always understood, a womanizer.</span> <span id="s121">All kinds of vices, but he was also very close friend of Shajno Mach.</span> <span id="s122">So Arthur, as I understand, went to Shajno Mach and he arranged that we were released from Sered.</span> <span id="s123">I remember that one day a car showed up and we were let out.</span> <span id="s124">And the magic word was a phonogram.</span> <span id="s125">I did not know what a phonogram was, but I can still visualize it.</span> <span id="s126">It was a white piece of paper with something written on it, and it had a red stripe across.</span> <span id="s127">And this was the paper that gave the orders to let us go.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: Did you have any idea that you are being rescued from death by that?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: No.</span> <span id="s130">No.</span> <span id="s131">Quite the con...I think I was...I was... I must have had mixed feelings.</span> <span id="s132">I don't know exactly, but I know that part of the feeling was there will be no train ride.</span> <span id="s133">So that was the negative feeling.</span> <span id="s134">But I already saw some misery.</span> <span id="s135">I remember and I can still visualize it.</span> <span id="s136">There was a man laying on a stretcher.</span> <span id="s137">There were many people around him.</span> <span id="s138">And it bothered me terribly because this man was not</span></p> <p><span id="s139">01:15: supposed to be there.</span> <span id="s140">He was ill.</span> <span id="s141">He was supposed to be in some kind of a therapeutic environment.</span> <span id="s142">I couldn't verbalize it at that time in this way, but I just remember that this was disturbing.</span> <span id="s143">The other disturbing thing was that we had extremely small space and we were sleeping on the floor and we were sleeping on straw.</span> <span id="s144">And this was again something that doesn't happen to you when you are in comfortable times.</span> <span id="s145">So it must have been a mixed bag but that I am not going to take a train ride that bothered me.</span> <span id="s146">So we got out of there and we knew that we have to go into a semi-hiding.</span> <span id="s147">So we went to a town called Bardell (ph) which is in eastern Slovakia.</span> <span id="s148">And there we rented an apartment.</span> <span id="s149">Pollack could no longer practice as a independent dentist, but he took employment with a Jewish dentist.</span> <span id="s150">It was 1942.</span> <span id="s151">And we stayed in this town til 1943.</span> <span id="s152">I went to school there.</span> <span id="s153">And then some how things became bad.</span> <span id="s154">Was either end of 1943 or even the beginning of 1944.</span> <span id="s155">and Pollack decided that we have to go into hiding again.</span> <span id="s156">Not complete hiding, but just out of site into some location where we will be safer than in Bardell which is a quite Slovak conditions, quite a big town.</span> <span id="s157">Let's say it had 20,000 inhabitants.</span> <span id="s158">And he made a very unfortunate decision.</span> <span id="s159">He decided together with two extended families, maybe some 35 people, that all of us are going to go back to Western Slovakia to a village named Sharfia (ph.), near Nitra.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: Hadn't some of you become nominally Lutherans at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: We came Lutherans in Bardell.</span> <span id="s162">Yes.</span> <span id="s163">In Bardell we...we attended church.</span> <span id="s164">We got papers that we were Lutherans.</span> <span id="s165">I still have the baptismal certificate.</span> <span id="s166">And it was a serious situation, yet it was a funny situation too because Pollack was brought up in a Yeshiva and was brought up as an Orthodox Jew.</span> <span id="s167">And to see this man forcing me and his wife to go to a Lutheran service was quite a funny sight.</span> <span id="s168">And on top of everything, he would also use every opportunity and go to a synagogue.</span> <span id="s169">I don't think it was a synagogue anymore.</span> <span id="s170">It was a stiebel.</span> <span id="s171">It was a prayer hall, but nevertheless came, so the same man who on a Sunday would piously sit in a church with us, on a Friday night on a Shabat or on a holiday would put on his talith and pray in a stiebel.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: Were you aware of the incongruity of that at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s174">Oh yes.</span> <span id="s175">I was 8 and I remember I had a friend there whose name was Thury, who I will tell you a very sad story about Thury.</span> <span id="s176">His name was Arthur.</span> <span id="s177">His nickname was Thury.</span> <span id="s178">And I remember we were somehow discussing it and had a good time discussing the funny aspect of that.</span> <span id="s179">Because his family had nothing to do with the Lutherans.</span> <span id="s180">We were</span></p> <p><span id="s181">01:19: the ones.</span> <span id="s182">I don't know why.</span> <span id="s183">I don't know how it happened, but we were the ones who attended the Lutheran services.</span> <span id="s184">So now Pollack took this maybe 35 peoople to this village of Sharfia, and it was a very stupid decision because first of all, this village alone had many Hlinka guards.</span> <span id="s185">And one evening somebody came to tell us...somebody from the village, "Listen, tomorrow the Nazis are coming with the Hlinka guards.‚Äù</span> <span id="s186">There were already Germans in the country.</span> <span id="s187">"And they're going to take everybody.‚Äù</span> <span id="s188">And Pollack did not want to do anything about it.</span> <span id="s189">We were urged to go into the forest.</span> <span id="s190">Pollack had a son who was 19, 20 by that time.</span> <span id="s191">Maybe 21 by that time.</span> <span id="s192">And he said, "If you don't want to go, I am taking the child (meaning me) and my mother and we are asking anybody else who wants to leave to leave with us into the forest.‚Äù</span> <span id="s193">By the way, Pollack also brought to this village his brother, the baby that was about 4 months old.</span> <span id="s194">All in all there were maybe over 40 people.</span> <span id="s195">So the son of his, Marcel took us.</span> <span id="s196">He finally... he relented.</span> <span id="s197">His brother went too with a child that was my age, and his third brother stayed with his 4 month old child.</span> <span id="s198">So only the two families, we left at night for the woods.</span> <span id="s199">Sunday morning, trucks appeared with Hlinka guards, with Nazis, loaded up everybody and took them to a village called Nemchita.</span> <span id="s200">A few miles from this spot they had to dig out their own grave and they were all executed there.</span> <span id="s201">The children were not...they're not even shot.</span> <span id="s202">They were just buried alive.</span> <span id="s203">And I know that because after the war Pollack went to the exhumation.</span> <span id="s204">And I was there too.</span> <span id="s205">I was on the side.</span> <span id="s206">I did not see the act in itself, and I know that that was the conclusion.</span> <span id="s207">The children were not even killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: Did you know about what had happened, though, in Sharfia.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s210">Yes.</span> <span id="s211">And incidently, this Thury whom I mentioned from Bardell, we had a fight shortly after we arrived in this village, the two of us, and either I pushed him or he fell and he had quite a large wound on his leg.</span> <span id="s212">And when they exhumed him, he still had the bandages on his leg.</span> <span id="s213">Well, now they are buried in a mass grave near this.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: At the time this event took place, you and the Pollacks were in the woods...in the forest, so you had escaped this and you heard about it after you returned.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: You weren't directly involved?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: We heard about it from the son of this man who came to warn 01:23: us and this son, he was bringing us food into the forest.</span> <span id="s218">And we had a plan, again worked out by this Marcel, that we will go deeper into the forest until we find Partisans who were fighting the Nazis.</span> <span id="s219">So that's what we were trying to do.</span> <span id="s220">But somehow we did not manage to connect with them.</span> <span id="s221">Maybe they were too far.</span> <span id="s222">They were in the center part of Slovakia, and one day as I was searching for some food because we were really very short of food in the forest.</span> <span id="s223">I came upon a hunting lodge that was owned by a name, a man named Baron Leonhardy.</span> <span id="s224">He was married to a Jewish lady, but he was a German in good standing.</span> <span id="s225">I don't know whether he was a member of the Nazi party.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: How did you get to Baron Leonhardy?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: It was in the forest where we were staying and we had some...out of...we had two blankets and we built a tent-like structure.</span> <span id="s228">And since those two brothers, the two Pollacks were constantly quarreling together and I could not get along with the son of Pollack's brother, I always made some forays into the forest.</span> <span id="s229">And it must have been a few hundred yards from where we were hiding there was this hunting lodge.</span> <span id="s230">And I remember Leonhardy he was a tall man, sitting on the porch, and I don't know whether he asked me what was I doing there, but I know that they feed me and they gave me food and I brought it to both the Pollack families.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: Were you led to Baron Leonhardy by Linka?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: No.</span> <span id="s233">Linka was a maid at Leonhardy's house and she saw a situation and she offered that she will take us at night to the same village from where they took these 35 to 40 people and that we can hide in their barn.</span> <span id="s234">And this is what happened.</span> <span id="s235">Linka was about 25 years old.</span> <span id="s236">She took us and we were hiding in the barn and we would have survived the war there, but Simon Pollack ran out of cash.</span> <span id="s237">He was paying Linka's father so that he can get some food.</span> <span id="s238">But he ran out of cash and Linka's father said, "Look it is...I don't know.</span> <span id="s239">But now it's maybe August 44.</span> <span id="s240">Said, "Don't worry.</span> <span id="s241">The war will end and you will pay me," but Pollack concluded for some reason he has to pay.</span> <span id="s242">Otherwise we are in trouble.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Whether he assumed that they won't keep us without money, which I think was the wrong conclusion or whether the man did not have money to go and buy food, which I don't think was the case because the man was growing his food and I remember they were slaughtering a pig while we were there hiding in the barn.</span> <span id="s244">And I remember big disputes between him and his brother.</span> <span id="s245">They really had fights there.</span> <span id="s246">They had fights that necessitated the separation of the two families in the barn under the worst of circumstances.</span> <span id="s247">So he asked his brother whether he has has cash and his brother told him no, he does not.</span> <span id="s248">So Pollack since he was a dentist, he was missing some teeth and before we went into hiding from</span></p> <p><span id="s249">01:27:30 Barbell, he created some removable dental work out of gold.</span> <span id="s250">And he said, "I have this gold here.</span> <span id="s251">I am going to send Linka's brother to sell it, and we'll have money.</span> <span id="s252">So Linka's brother took the gold, went to Piestany, got drunk, told somebody that here he has the gold that the Jews who are in hiding in his house are selling, and he must have realized what he has done because he came back running to the village and he said what he had done.</span> <span id="s253">So in a hurry it was at night, we picked ourselves up, run back into the forest.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: How long had you been in that barn before that happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: I don't...must have been a few weeks.</span> <span id="s256">And we ran there and there was sort of a small hut that belonged to one of the villagers.</span> <span id="s257">So that's where we went.</span> <span id="s258">That's where we were hiding.</span> <span id="s259">And what I remember a big bang and the tiles that covered the roof broke up.</span> <span id="s260">And then there was banging on the door and they dragged us out and all I remember seeing: Hlinka guards, some behind machine guns and laying on the ground.</span> <span id="s261">I remember 3 or 4 SS men in uniforms and they were dragging us out from this hut and as we came out, one of the Hlinka guards said, "You are going to dig a ditch and Pollack became hysterical and so did his brother.</span> <span id="s262">The women were very calm, and the two boys...the two of us, we were very calm.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: Did you have any idea what the implication of that was?</span> <span id="s264">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s265">Yes.</span> <span id="s266">At that time I knew exactly what was happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: Let me interrupt for a second.</span> <span id="s268">At this point, you were about...a boy of 9 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: How much awareness did you have and what were your feelings up to this point of everything that had happened to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: In my life, it's a very significant moment.</span> <span id="s272">That's the first time I remember thinking about a supernatural being, so there's God.</span> <span id="s273">And I was so calm that...Pollack's wife told me that I was barefooted.</span> <span id="s274">She said, "Put on shoes.‚Äù</span> <span id="s275">And I said, "Why would I need shoes?"</span> <span id="s276">I remember the thought was, "How preposterous that she should ask me to put on shoes.</span> <span id="s277">In a short while later we won't be any more.‚Äù</span> <span id="s278">I remember this thought very vividly.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: You knew...you knew that you are going to die at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: That we are going to die.</span> <span id="s281">The second thing I remember that they were throwing out... Oh, actually I found out what happened.</span> <span id="s282">Why did those tiles on the roof break?</span> <span id="s283">They threw a grenade.</span> <span id="s284">It did not explode.</span> <span id="s285">So one of the SS men went upstairs and was throwing our belongings down.</span> <span id="s286">One of them was a sort of an attache case that broke open while it was coming down from the first floor and it was full of bank notes and it belonged to the brother of Pollack.</span> <span id="s287">He had plenty of money, but said he didn't have any.</span> <span id="s288">That means had he said he has money, we would not have been in that predicament.</span> <span id="s289">We would have been in hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: He didn't let his brother know at the time his brother was trying to pawn the gold tooth?</span> <span id="s291">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s292">And he wouldn't share the money.</span> <span id="s293">So we are going to die.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">01:31:30</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: Would you express that.</span> <span id="s296">The fact that I've just said, the fact about Pollack's brother's behavior and its effects.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s298">He was asked whether he has any money and he said he doesn't have.</span> <span id="s299">Had he said he has money...had he just lent it to his brother, we would have been safe because I remember the number of bank notes and the bank notes were in thousand crown denominations.</span> <span id="s300">That would have saved us.</span> <span id="s301">So as we were standing there and the man got hysterical, suddenly somebody came from the village on a motorcycle, a Nazi, and gave instructions.</span> <span id="s302">I did not hear him what he was saying, but it was obvious because they stopped everything and they took us down the village.</span> <span id="s303">Later we found out that the instruction was to take us down to the village to put us on a truck and to take us to Nitra, which was the county town, into the jail and to find out from us where the Partisans are.</span> <span id="s304">That we must know because we were caught in the forest.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: So you were saved then because they thought you had information about the Partisans.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: Precisely.</span> <span id="s307">So they put us on a truck, and I remember sitting next to...there were maybe just a handful of SS men.</span> <span id="s308">The rest were Hlinka guards.</span> <span id="s309">And this SS man gave me something to eat, and I remember touching his gun and he sort of showed it to me.</span> <span id="s310">At that time, we already knew what happened in Nenchita.</span> <span id="s311">And my thought was they are taking us somewhere else for the same purpose as they took Thurie and all the 40 people around him.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: They had all been killed in Nenchita?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: All been killed.</span> <span id="s314">We already knew about that.</span> <span id="s315">Before we knew, we appeared in...in Nitra, and that was where the ...sort of the ...that was the time when there were Nitra, our arrival, there was no more time for any light thoughts.</span> <span id="s316">They lined us up.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">q: Nitra was a prison, not a concentration camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: Nitra was a prison.</span> <span id="s319">And I remember an old Hlinka guard.</span> <span id="s320">At that time he seemed to me a very old man.</span> <span id="s321">He might have been in his late 50s, but he appeared as an old man and he introduced himself to us.</span> <span id="s322">He said, "My name is Homola," and something to the effect, "I will make your life miserable.‚Äù</span> <span id="s323">And with saying this, he hit old Pollack with butt of his gun.</span> <span id="s324">Then they crammed us into a cell which must have been very small, and there were already some prisoners and with us included, there was barely room to sit.</span> <span id="s325">And we were sitting there, and I remember I felt very miserable because I was hungry.</span> <span id="s326">I was cold and there was no possibility to move, no possibility to go to the bathroom and suddenly, the door opened and the Hlinka guard entered and took me and took this son of Pollack's brother, Ari, threw us out, closed the door behind them and from then on I heard only screaming.</span> <span id="s327">Must have been going on...I don't know...for maybe a half an hour or so.</span> <span id="s328">And when I came in, I remember the first sight was Pollack's wife who was all bloody.</span> <span id="s329">They beat them severely.</span> <span id="s330">And then they took me and Ari and threw us back and we spent the night in this state.</span> <span id="s331">It was...that was one of the worst moments of my entire experience with...with...</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: You say that there is no more lightness.</span> <span id="s333">Is this kind of a turning point in the whole experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: It was a dark moment because later on optimism again surfaced.</span> <span id="s335">Hope again surfaced, but at that time it was just bleak, dark, no hope.</span> <span id="s336">The next day, somebody opened the door.</span> <span id="s337">It was a Hlinka guard, and in a very vulgar way asked us to use the bathroom.</span> <span id="s338">He used very descriptive language to go to the bathroom and what to do there in a Slovak---in the Slovak language.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: What did he actually say?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: He said, ??</span> <span id="s341">.</span> <span id="s342">That means go and do number l and do number 2.</span> <span id="s343">Short while later, a man came and brought in some food.</span> <span id="s344">And Pollack looked at him and said,</span></p> <p><span id="s345">01:37: "Aren't you Mr. Kopsa?"</span> <span id="s346">And sure enough he was.</span> <span id="s347">The non-Jewish prisoner...I don't know for what reason...I think he was a Czech originally and that might have been the reason that he was in a Slovak prison.</span> <span id="s348">And that was the first spark of lightness again.</span> <span id="s349">We knew somebody who is in a position of power in prison, and we know him.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: How did Mr. Pollack know him?</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: Must have been a patient of his.</span> <span id="s352">I don't know exactly how.</span> <span id="s353">I think he was a patient of his who used to come to Piestany to take a cure.</span> <span id="s354">Piestany is a spa, quite a well known spa for treating rheumatism.</span> <span id="s355">And then just a day or so later, Pollack was called by the commandant of the prison.</span> <span id="s356">I believe his name was Cunsa.</span> <span id="s357">I am almost sure it was Cunsa.</span> <span id="s358">And he told Pollack... I was there.</span> <span id="s359">I was present when he was telling him that.</span> <span id="s360">And I remember it because it was something that drew my attention.</span> <span id="s361">He told him in German: Wenn Ich Dich jetzt weiter schicke, das Kind geht gleich durch den Kamin.</span> <span id="s362">Which means 'If I send you on now, the child will go [immediately] through the chimney.'</span> <span id="s363">And so that's how I remember also that we did not have to wait til the war's end or to be in a camp where there were gas chambers and crematoria, that this was no secret that this process was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: Did you know that at the time?</span> <span id="s365">Did the Pollacks know what happened to the people?</span> <span id="s366">A: Before this, I know that I heard it long before the war</span></p> <p><span id="s367">01:39: ended, that there was mass extermination going on.</span> <span id="s368">I know that this was no secret.</span> <span id="s369">So Cunsa continued and said, "Look, I will do one thing.</span> <span id="s370">You are a dentist.</span> <span id="s371">There are plenty of Jewish dental offices that have been closed in this town.</span> <span id="s372">Tomorrow, you will go.</span> <span id="s373">You will select one.</span> <span id="s374">We will move the entire dental office here, and you will fix our teeth.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">And Pollack somehow must have felt very happy because he told him, "That's wonderful Mr. Commandant, Herr Commandant.</span> <span id="s376">I will make you the most beautiful teeth.‚Äù</span> <span id="s377">And Cunsa said: Wenn ich in der Erdt bin ist se mir scheissegal ob ich gute Zaehne hab oder nicht.</span> <span id="s378">When I am buried, it doesn't make a damn bit of difference whether I have good teeth or not.</span> <span id="s379">And from there on, sure enough, within a short period of time, might have been a week, Pollack was working as a dentist in the prison.</span> <span id="s380">His wife was helping him as an assistant.</span> <span id="s381">We had all the food in the world.</span> <span id="s382">The negative attitude of this Hlinka guard suddenly changed.</span> <span id="s383">They were bringing their wives in.</span> <span id="s384">They had their teeth fixed.</span> <span id="s385">And we were just having good times.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: What did you, as a boy of 9, make of all this?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: I was...well, first of all I..</span> <span id="s388">.</span> <span id="s389">I was very important.</span> <span id="s390">I was now free to move to the corridors of the prison, and one night I remember we heard some crying going on, as if</span></p> <p><span id="s391">01:41: somebody was tortured.</span> <span id="s392">And sure enough, I found out that in the neighboring cells there were Wehrmacht soldiers who tried to escape from the war front, and they were brought to Nitra, and they were tortured there.</span> <span id="s393">And I had the opportunity to get food and to get some food to them as a 9 year old boy.</span> <span id="s394">So I felt very important.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: Did you...you didn't regard them as your enemies amongst them?</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: Absolutely not.</span> <span id="s397">Absolutely not.</span> <span id="s398">I did not have one negative thought about them.</span> <span id="s399">As a matter of fact, in that prison my only negative thoughts were about the Hlinka guards, because the only Nazi with whom I had something to do was Cunza who I already realized from his...what he said that he saving our lives.</span> <span id="s400">Then one night, the Allies bombed Nitra and in a hurry they had to pack us up and they sent us on concentration camp Sered.</span> <span id="s401">So again was from...from a very positive situation to a very negative because suddenly we were in Sered.</span> <span id="s402">Wooden barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: Was your family treated differently from the others or was everybody from there sent from Nitra to Sered?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: I think they just had to vacate the prison.</span> <span id="s405">I don't know what happened to the Nazi soldiers.</span> <span id="s406">I have some idea because after the war, I was asked to make a deposition about Cunsa, and I said what he did for us and it's my understanding that he was executed because he signed execution orders for some partisans and maybe for some of these deserters as well.</span> <span id="s407">So he was executed.</span> <span id="s408">Now in Sered, we found...</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: What was the trip...trip to Sered like?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: I don't remember.</span> <span id="s411">I don't even know how we got to Sered.</span> <span id="s412">Whether it was by train or by truck, I don't remember.</span> <span id="s413">In Sered we spend a few weeks and the commandant there was the infamous Bruno who, to this day, is somewhere in hiding in Syria.</span> <span id="s414">And Bruno took it upon himself to torture Simon Pollack.</span> <span id="s415">He found out that he was a prominent prisoner in Nitra, and he must have felt a need to reduce him to the level of every other inmate in Sered.</span> <span id="s416">So he would call him to...and he tortured him.</span> <span id="s417">He beat him, and Pollack was a slight man, short, and I remember him.</span> <span id="s418">Every time he came back, he was quite shaken up.</span> <span id="s419">We spend a few weeks.</span> <span id="s420">.</span> <span id="s421">I don't know how long in Sered, and from Sered then I went to Theresienstadt with the women</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: You went.</span> <span id="s423">Not the others?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">01:44:30</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: No.</span> <span id="s426">There was a whole transport.</span> <span id="s427">I don't know exactly the date, but our number was: sechs und zwanzig zwo einund vierzig [26241].</span> <span id="s428">This was my number.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: You were in Sered for just a couple of weeks?</span> <span id="s430">A: Might have been a couple of weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: And then when you were sent to Theresienstadt, would you tell us some details about how that took place and how you got there.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: I got there, there was a selection.</span> <span id="s433">You go left, you go right.</span> <span id="s434">Only it wasn't...uh... Q: Was there a train trip to Theresienstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: There was a train trip to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s436">Q: Would you tell us about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s438">First of all, they separated us, and I remember Pollack crying there with his wife and I remember it appeared to me a quite a paradoxical(ly) and outright grotesque situation because they were constantly quarreling.</span> <span id="s439">And now that they were being separated and Bruno was standing there.</span> <span id="s440">He was crying...Pollack was crying.</span> <span id="s441">He said, "If we survive this, I will be...I don't know, a model husband and we will never have these quarrels, etcetera, etcetera.</span> <span id="s442">And Bruno was standing there and I remember pulling Pollack's hat on his eyes and saying: Wir kennen Dich schon , Du alter Simulant.</span> <span id="s443">Which means we know each other already, you old faker, because Simulant in German is applied to a person who pretends pain or...</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: And you as a boy at 9 had considerable grown up a good deal by that time.</span> <span id="s445">01:47:</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s447">Oh yes.</span> <span id="s448">I was looking at the train and they put us on the train and I knew I have to have a spot where I will be able to see outside because there were just four small windows, much high up for me to see anything.</span> <span id="s449">So I thought if I am next to the door...I did not know that it will be slammed shut...that I will be able to see.</span> <span id="s450">So I placed myself there and another woman came with her son and I consider him a spoiled brat because they pushed me away from my spot and this is going to be for him.</span> <span id="s451">And I couldn't defend myself and there was nobody else to defend me, so I was pushed aside.</span> <span id="s452">But then he had to move because they but a bucket there.</span> <span id="s453">And finally they slammed shut the car and...the cattle car, and we were standing there.</span> <span id="s454">I don't know how long.</span> <span id="s455">It was not hot, so it was bearable.</span> <span id="s456">It was fall of 44.</span> <span id="s457">But before the train moved, I know the bucket was full.</span> <span id="s458">And once the train moved, the bucket tipped over and this kid who took my spot got the bulk of it.</span> <span id="s459">So I remember deriving some satisfaction from this.</span> <span id="s460">I don't know how long the trip...trip took to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s461">From...from Sered to Theresienstadt, it might be less than 200 miles, somewhere between 150 and 200 miles, but I know that it was either 2 days or more.</span> <span id="s462">Because the reason...every time there was a transport with military going back and forth, they put this train ...they side tracked it, and we stand there.</span> <span id="s463">Finally, we arrived in Theresienstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: During that 2 or 3 days, did you get any food or water or air?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s466">I don't know what the supply was.</span> <span id="s467">I remember air because I remember that somebody would open that door and I saw something was going on.</span> <span id="s468">I have no idea what we ate on this trip.</span> <span id="s469">I only remember there was quite a lot of moaning and there must have been quite a lot of sickness and I remembered tremendous overcrowding.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: Anybody die?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: I do not remember, but the overcrowding was terrible.</span> <span id="s472">The only negative thoughts are about the overcrowding.</span> <span id="s473">I do not remember either thirst or hunger.</span> <span id="s474">And once...now we arrived in Theresienstadt and again there's a very negative first impression because Theresienstadt is a garrison city surrounding by a fortress, by moats, and we arrived at the entrance of the fortress and was early in the morning and was a lot of noise, a lot of screaming, "Raus, Raus, Raus.‚Äù</span> <span id="s475">And they registered us.</span> <span id="s476">And I was with the woman...with Pollack's wife and she was assigned to a spot which again was considered prominent.</span> <span id="s477">She was assigned to what was called in German Entaeusung, a place where they deloused people.</span> <span id="s478">They go through shower and shaving and get rid of lice because lice we had...Lice we already had in Sered I remember.</span> <span id="s479">So I stayed with her for awhile.</span> <span id="s480">I don't know for how long.</span> <span id="s481">And then suddenly transports started arriving in Theresienstadt from other concentration camps.</span> <span id="s482">I understand that the plan was to concentrate as many people in Theresienstadt as possible, and then to liquidate the camp.</span> <span id="s483">Blow it up or...I don't know in what way, but that was...the plan was to liquidate it.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: This was in November, December 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: This is already December, maybe January of 45.</span> <span id="s486">And so she had to get rid of me because they had so much work.</span> <span id="s487">Then my transports were coming, so I was put with Dutch children into a home.</span> <span id="s488">There were already no Czech or Slovak children.</span> <span id="s489">They were all sent on to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s490">Just...Theresienstadt was basically just a..</span> <span id="s491">.</span> <span id="s492">they called Sammellager.</span> <span id="s493">It was ghetto, but it was Sammellager.</span> <span id="s494">That means they...they brought in people for further transport to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s495">So I was put with Dutch children.</span> <span id="s496">And now the transports started arriving and Theresienstadt was built...it was a garrison city by Maria Theresia in the 18th Century.</span> <span id="s497">It was supposed to hold 7,000 people and at one point it got up to, I believe, to somewhere 40,000 people.</span> <span id="s498">And I remember prisoners arriving from other camps, and that was a terrible sight because there I remember dead bodies, terribly emaciated people, which we up to that point did not see in Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s499">Theresienstadt was always maintained as a model ghetto so when the Red Cross, the Danish Red Cross came they would take them there and they would show that the Jews have their self government.</span> <span id="s500">Incidentally, I worked for sometime as an Ordnanz.</span> <span id="s501">That means a runner for the elder of the Judenrat.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: Were you there when the Red Cross visit was made?</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: I was there.</span> <span id="s504">At that day when they arrived, I was in the home, in the Dutch home, and I remember they prepared us for the visit and I remember very well they gave us each a glass of milk.</span> <span id="s505">By that time I haven't seen milk for God knows how long, and they said, "When they appear, you will drink the milk.‚Äù</span> <span id="s506">The reason probably I remember it because the milk was boiled and when you boil milk you get a what I call a skin, and that's probably the only food that I would not eat at gunpoint, and I remember not drinking that milk.</span> <span id="s507">So the Red Cross came and everything was organized.</span> <span id="s508">There was an orchestra playing.</span> <span id="s509">There were cafes.</span> <span id="s510">We had what they called Ghetto Gelt.</span> <span id="s511">We had money.</span> <span id="s512">You couldn't buy anything for it, but there was money in five or six different denominations.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">01:53:30</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: Did the Red Cross people talk to you at all, ask you questions?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: I don't remember them talking to us at all.</span> <span id="s516">I just remember them being accompanied by some high SS official and I remember the SS official in that room where I was standing.</span> <span id="s517">We had the bunk beds, three high, and he went and with his glove took a sample whether there was dust.</span> <span id="s518">I remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: Remember how you felt about that at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: No.</span> <span id="s521">No.</span> <span id="s522">Seemed to be like a curious event sort of a welcome change from monotonous routine.</span> <span id="s523">But Theresientstadt in itself, up to the point when the transports were arriving, was bearable.</span> <span id="s524">If one was free of disease and if one was in a situation like me, if one basically had a bunk for himself, not too overcrowded, and there was some food available and what was not available I was always able to either steal or I remember there was one of these fake banks that they have and I would go there and they somehow took pity on me and found even a pair of shoes which I did not have up to that point.</span> <span id="s525">So there was always...as compared to a Sered which was looked and was a concentration camp, Theresienstadt was a city and it gave an appearance of a city and give an appearance of some semblance of normalcy.</span> <span id="s526">There were Jewish policemen in some funny uniforms.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">There was the Judenrat which had some bureaucratic tasks.</span> <span id="s528">As I said I worked as a runner for the Judenaeltester, whose name was Murmelstein.</span> <span id="s529">We used to call him Murmelswine because he wasn't one of the nicest persons.</span> <span id="s530">After the war, I understand he became a financial advisor to the Vatican.</span> <span id="s531">He succeeded a man who went to the gas chambers Edelstein, who was the Judenaeltester before him.</span> <span id="s532">So life had a semblance of normalcy or what I would consider normalcy at that time.</span> <span id="s533">And a few short months afterwards, we were liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: What happened after the transports came and the things change?</span> <span id="s535">Did that lead into liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: Things changed.</span> <span id="s537">I remember every day seeing carts with dead bodies heading toward the crematorium.</span> <span id="s538">The most frightening thing up to the point was when somebody was taken to the small fortress.</span> <span id="s539">There was what was called Grosse Festung.</span> <span id="s540">That was the city of Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s541">And there was Kleine Festung, small fortress, which was on the outskirts.</span> <span id="s542">And if somebody was taken to the small fortress meant that you could write him or her off.</span> <span id="s543">Separately administered, was administered by a sadistic SS man and his two sadistic daughters who took pleasure in letting German shepherds loose on prisoners and he the SS man who administered the Kleine Festung was a sadistic guy named Joko, was executed after the war.</span> <span id="s544">While in the ghetto itself, we barely saw an SS man.</span> <span id="s545">The head of the camp was Rahn(?)</span> <span id="s546">.</span> <span id="s547">He was an SS man.</span> <span id="s548">I remember seeing him twice or three times.</span> <span id="s549">There was another SS man, Seidel, whom we would see from time to time on a bicycle.</span> <span id="s550">But otherwise there were Czech policemen, who were quite decent, most of them.</span> <span id="s551">I was also involved in a plot.</span> <span id="s552">There were train coming and they're bringing in the transports and one of the engineers wanted to take me out of the camp, smuggle me out of the camp, take me with him.</span> <span id="s553">And I remember climbing the engine and somebody caught me and sort of pushed me or kicked me in a very forceful way.</span> <span id="s554">Otherwise, Theresienstadt showed positive human aspect of fellow prisoners.</span> <span id="s555">The women who were teaching children to sing.</span> <span id="s556">Ther was some attempt to teach us how to read and write.</span> <span id="s557">Before I came to Theresienstadt there were operas staged there.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: Clearly, there were some people, some humanbeings who lit up the prevailing gloom with good deeds toward you.</span> <span id="s561">What are your views about the way you were treated in general by people?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: You see it has always been enormously helpful to me, to my thoughts, to my psyche, the fact that there were many good people to whom I owe my life.</span> <span id="s563">There was so much negative.</span> <span id="s564">For example when they led us from the place where they wanted to execute us...when they led us through the village of Sharfia and loaded us up on the trucks taking us to Nitra, I remember people standing in the doorways and laughing (clearing throat) because we were quite a grotesque lot.</span> <span id="s565">This is balanced (clearing throat)...excuse me...by a person like Linka, even by her brother who got drunk.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: Rudolph?</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: This was Linka's brother I believe his name was also Rudolph.</span> <span id="s568">But he paid a terrible price.</span> <span id="s569">He spent the rest of the war in a concentration camp, came back a cripple, and died prematurely.</span> <span id="s570">But there were many people.</span> <span id="s571">There was Cunza in Nitra.</span> <span id="s572">And from my thinking, it was always important to know that not all this dark, black, and what very often surprises me is that when we discussed this event, we need a black and white story, that we refuse to think in shades.</span> <span id="s573">That when one brings in one good SS man as if this just distorted the story, while the opposite is true.</span> <span id="s574">One good SS man doesn't change anything on the bestiality of the whole establishment of the SS, of their deeds, but it is a reality that there was one positive humanbeing or maybe just positive vis-a-vis me.</span> <span id="s575">I need that for my assessment and for my view of life.</span> <span id="s576">I don't want to think in terms of...</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: So you don't come out of this really embittered against the human race.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: Not at all.</span> <span id="s579">Not at all.</span> <span id="s580">For me to know the whole story is important.</span> <span id="s581">The million children who died is as important to know as to know the fact that some...I don't know...some four thousand Jews survived in Berlin along, with the help of Germans.</span> <span id="s582">I met a man in Berlin.</span> <span id="s583">I will tell you just this one episode and really...I seldom break down and cry but I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">They were doing a documentary about the Kristallnacht, 50th anniversary of the Kristallnacht, and I spoke to a man who is approaching 70.</span> <span id="s585">He lived in Berlin in the open till the beginning of 1944.</span> <span id="s586">With the yellow star he was traveling the streets of Berlin, and he was working believe it or not for some form of a Jewish community that was still functioning and he said he would get on a public transport system and somebody would push an apple in his hand.</span> <span id="s587">And one day he was returning home from his errands through the streets of Berlin with his star, and he saw that they were loading his parents on a truck.</span> <span id="s588">So he said, "Well, this is it.‚Äù</span> <span id="s589">So he ran to a woman that he knew, a German woman, who was hiding him from the beginning of 1944 until the end of World War II.</span> <span id="s590">It was close to a year and a half.</span> <span id="s591">She was sleeping.</span> <span id="s592">She had a one room apartment.</span> <span id="s593">The one room apartment had a small corridor, maybe three by two meters.</span> <span id="s594">For this year and a half she was sleeping in this corridor and this teenager was sleeping in that one living room for close to a year and a half.</span> <span id="s595">So this is important to include in the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">02:05:20</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: Things are not entirely black and white.</span> <span id="s598">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: Let's get you back to to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s600">Are there any other episodes there that might be interesting to talk about during your stay before the liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: There are many things.</span> <span id="s602">There are many nationalities in Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s603">Everybody was looking for a survival method.</span> <span id="s604">I was constantly hungry and looking for food.</span> <span id="s605">And I had a friend with whom we would roam the streets and just look for an opportunity to get something to eat.</span> <span id="s606">The best opportunity was when the new transport arrived and people brought some food so you could go and you could try to acquire it, to steal it.</span> <span id="s607">So I remember we stole a big jar of jam and we ate it in hiding and we came back down and they were already two women in each other's hair accusing the other of stealing this jar.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: The two accused the other?</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: Pardon.</span> <span id="s610">One accused the other of stealing it while we ate it just a few minutes before that.</span> <span id="s611">I was as I said, I was a street smart kid and I developed connections.</span> <span id="s612">There was a doctor from Piestany, Dr. Volstein, who came to the camp with his wife and with his daughter, my age.</span> <span id="s613">Then after the war I went to school with her.</span> <span id="s614">And I found him a job, peeling potatoes.</span> <span id="s615">It was a life saving job because peeling potatoes meaning he also had a extra potato.</span> <span id="s616">And he was very grateful.</span> <span id="s617">He said that if he survives the war, after the war he will do anything for me.</span> <span id="s618">And he survived the war and came back to this small town, Piestany, in which they took us, where I after the war where I continued my high school education.</span> <span id="s619">And I know that he wanted to make good on his promise he will do anything for me.</span> <span id="s620">So he wanted me to go out with his daughter, but didn't work out.</span> <span id="s621">She was a rather homely looking girl I remember and...but I even told somebody that.</span> <span id="s622">It was rather an ungrateful gesture.</span> <span id="s623">And it was...was a funny...was a funny thing because this man who returned from the camp and his daughter, they just happened to look very Jewish.</span> <span id="s624">I know in America it sounds offensive now, but we used to talk that way in Europe.</span> <span id="s625">Somebody looks Jewish and somebody doesn't look Jewish.</span> <span id="s626">In America, it's today it's difficult to imagine because very few people we walk on the street.</span> <span id="s627">I wouldn't know whether they are Jewish or not Jewish.</span> <span id="s628">But there we did.</span> <span id="s629">And they looked very Jewish.</span> <span id="s630">But his daughter, when I would tell her...she became a Protestant after the war.</span> <span id="s631">I would say, "Do you remember our days in Theresienstadt?"</span> <span id="s632">And she would tell me, "I was never in Theresienstadt."</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q: She denied it all.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A: Complete denial.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Q: Well, then as the war drew to a close, tell us about the... liberation of Theresienstadt and how you got out.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">A: We just heard some shooting at night.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Q: Had conditions changed before that though dramatically?</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: No.</span> <span id="s639">We only found out after the war that preparations were going on to...to kill everybody.</span> <span id="s640">We also heard that Romm who was the SS commander of the camp wanted to save himself and revealed the plan to somebody, and that the Soviets had to do some maneuver with the army of Marshall Koniev, and instead of going directly to Prague to liberate Prague, which at that time there was an uprising in Prague going on...that they just made some...or part of the army made some detour and liberated Theresienstadt in a surprise move.</span> <span id="s641">Theresienstadt is about 40 miles north of Prague.</span> <span id="s642">So it was very fast.</span> <span id="s643">We woke up one morning and there were the Soviets in town.</span> <span id="s644">There was a typhus epidemic going on.</span> <span id="s645">I remember them working day and night trying to save people.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: So you had a favorable view of the Russian liberators?</span> <span id="s647">02:10:30</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s649">Many people died after the war.</span> <span id="s650">We were not let out of the camp immediately after liberation.</span> <span id="s651">I believe we were liberated May 8th and we did not leave the camp until the middle of June or so because of the typhus epidemic.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: How about the guards?</span> <span id="s653">Were they still there when the Russians came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: The Czech police nothing happened to them.</span> <span id="s655">The SS was no longer there.</span> <span id="s656">So we did not see them, but as I said we saw very little of them during the Nazi era.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: How did you feel at that point when you woke up, went outside and there were Russians instead of Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: We felt very, very good.</span> <span id="s659">We were very close to the Russians.</span> <span id="s660">I remember I then from Theresienstadt we left for Bratislava, the capital.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: How did you feel then knowing the war is over and you had survived?</span> <span id="s662">Did you have any conscientiousness of that at the point.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: The overall feeling is very important to me.</span> <span id="s664">When I look at that, when I think back of what I was thinking, it is incomprehensible to me that what I was thinking was this all is normal.</span> <span id="s665">That somebody took my father; that my mother is not there; that I am with strangers; that I'm going to a camp; that we are isolated as Jews and singled out for something because of the negative treatment; that some how this all is.</span> <span id="s666">.</span> <span id="s667">it's normal.</span> <span id="s668">That's the pogram of the day, a pogram of the month, a pogram of the year.</span> <span id="s669">And we were liberated with just a continuum.</span> <span id="s670">It was the next stage, but no cathartic relief.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">02:12:30</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: As a child with no experience of anything else, this seemed like the way life was.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: That's what's like.</span> <span id="s674">I remember one difference I noticed.</span> <span id="s675">We started our journey back to Slovakia, back to Bratislava which is just a few miles from Sered from where they took us to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s676">We were no longer in cattle cars.</span> <span id="s677">We were in a normal train.</span> <span id="s678">Took 3 days again because it was just after the war, troop movements etcetera, but it was a normal car and when the train stopped we could get off.</span> <span id="s679">I remember playing with other boys.</span> <span id="s680">So this was a dramatic change, but again it was just as this entire episode through the camps and through the hiding had ups and downs, and there were some extremely sad moments some moments of resignation, some movements of this is it, this is the end like we would be executed.</span> <span id="s681">But there were also highlights.</span> <span id="s682">There were also some funny moments.</span> <span id="s683">There were jokes.</span> <span id="s684">So we returned to Bratislava and a few weeks later, with Marcel who in the meantime survived Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s685">I did not mention when we were in the forest with Pollack with Marcel with his 20 year old son, he tried to connect with the Partisans and he left us one night that he's going to find the partisans and never came back.</span> <span id="s686">What happened the Nazis caught him.</span> <span id="s687">And he went through interim camp in Slovakia to Auschwitz and he survived Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s688">Not only did he survive Auschwitz, but when the Russians liberated Auschwitz, he became an interpreter for the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">And the Russians took him down south to liberate Budapest.</span> <span id="s690">And we went...when we came from Theresienstadt, means from the northwest, he came from the southeast from Budapest, and we met in Bratislava.</span> <span id="s691">And he was wearing sort of a Russian uniform.</span> <span id="s692">And then he started searching for his father, for Simon.</span> <span id="s693">And Simon came from Sachsenhausen to Prague to sort of a hospital because he could barely stand on his feet.</span> <span id="s694">So Simon came then from Prague to Bratislava, so we all met in Bratislava.</span> <span id="s695">Nothing ...nothing happened to us, to...to...</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: You all survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: We all survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: Could you tell us now, maybe not in the detail, just kind in a general way the things that have happened to you, what your life has been like, and outline since you since the end of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s700">Well, we went back to Piestany.</span> <span id="s701">Pollack opened his dental practice there.</span> <span id="s702">I went to school in Piestany.</span> <span id="s703">That was the beginnings were not too good.</span> <span id="s704">There was a lot of anti- Semitism in Slovakia.</span> <span id="s705">I began swimming.</span> <span id="s706">Piestany is a spa.</span> <span id="s707">It has thermal spas, and one can swim winter, summer, and I became a competitive swimmer the age of 13.</span> <span id="s708">My whole life revolved around going to high school and swimming.</span> <span id="s709">And I lived in Piestany until 1954.</span> <span id="s710">At the age of 19, I went to...I was accepted to law school in Bratislava.</span> <span id="s711">I completed law school, then I was drafted in the Air Force, 22 months.</span> <span id="s712">After that I practiced law in Prague for 10 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: You were married there?</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A: Married.</span> <span id="s715">Had two children.</span> <span id="s716">And I escaped from Czechoslovakia in 1968 just before the Russians marched in.</span> <span id="s717">An irony is that they installed a communist regime, so from the Russians that we liked and admired, they became the oppressor.</span> <span id="s718">So escaped from there in 68 just before the Russians occupied Czechoslovakia in 1968.</span> <span id="s719">Came to this country and I went to school again.</span> <span id="s720">Nobody needed a Czech-trained lawyer, so I got my Master's in social work.</span> <span id="s721">And then I worked in the field of refugees.</span> <span id="s722">I worked for a Jewish organization involved in bringing refugees out of countries of oppression and bringing them to this country.</span> <span id="s723">Then I worked, almost 10 years, for the Anti-Defamation League as Director of European Affairs.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: And you have a family?</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: I have a family.</span> <span id="s726">We have a 15 year old son, and by a previous marriage I have two sons.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">One is 29.</span> <span id="s728">One is 27.</span> <span id="s729">And we live in New York and go on.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">02:18:30</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: And, finally, can you tell us, Mr. Reiss, how you think all this has affected you.</span> <span id="s732">What...in these experiences at such an early age, what impact did it have on you in your later life and the kind of person you became?</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s734">You know I've been around for quite a while and it seems to me that there are two sentiments.</span> <span id="s735">One, when I pause for awhile and I see what can be crammed into this relatively short few years, it is mind boggling.</span> <span id="s736">On the other hand, I feel sometimes when I talk, especially with younger people, that in a way it is as thorough a school of life as one can get.</span> <span id="s737">How it affected me, I would like to think that it did not affect me in a negative way, except in some ways, for example, we very often discuss it with my wife.</span> <span id="s738">Joyce has an enormous family, somewhere all forty first cousins and we would show up on all these family occasions, and I have my wife and my three sons so compared to her family, I feel like a soloist there.</span> <span id="s739">And that brings out sometimes very negative feelings.</span> <span id="s740">Why am I in this situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: Feelings of sorrow?</span> <span id="s742">02:20:40</span></p> <p><span id="s743">A: In a way.</span> <span id="s744">The other thing that I still do not understand quite well, but I know that these are the feelings that when I was growing up I never missed my parents as a child.</span> <span id="s745">Did not occur to me.</span> <span id="s746">They're simply not there.</span> <span id="s747">I used to call the Pollack family...him I used to call Father and her I used to call Mother.</span> <span id="s748">And when I became independent, grown up, I suddenly began missing my parents.</span> <span id="s749">And to this day, I don't think of myself as a victim.</span> <span id="s750">Matter of fact, I dislike the notion.</span> <span id="s751">So I don't think I am a victim.</span> <span id="s752">Thank God, I function like any other human being.</span> <span id="s753">I feel that once I already had to go through that experience that it enriched me in many ways.</span> <span id="s754">The saddest thought is that my father was 15 years younger than I am now was just as intelligent, bright good man, just taken and killed like an animal.</span> <span id="s755">I don't have the thoughts about my mother.</span> <span id="s756">My mother died fighting them.</span> <span id="s757">She was caught.</span> <span id="s758">She was executed.</span> <span id="s759">She lost, but she lost fighting.</span> <span id="s760">So I don't have negative feelings.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Q: There was some dignity in her death.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">A: Precisely.</span> <span id="s763">So those are some of the thoughts, thoughts about my parents come to mind daily.</span> <span id="s764">For myself, I don't know whether it's a coping mechanism, but I always had the ability and I applied to life in general that perhaps when things become a little bit uncomfortable I can take myself</span></p> <p><span id="s765">02:22:30 out of the situation and become a spectator rather than a participant.</span> <span id="s766">And I feel that it's a helpful device.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Q: Maybe that helped you a bit during the experiences.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s769">And...and also I'm trying to look in stories for a..</span> <span id="s770">.</span> <span id="s771">for all sides of the story.</span> <span id="s772">I will give you an example.</span> <span id="s773">Old Pollack, that's what I call him now.</span> <span id="s774">He has been dead for 20 years, but we had a very nice relationship.</span> <span id="s775">He was in Sachsenhausen and he was sort of a jokester.</span> <span id="s776">He always looked for the funny in a situation.</span> <span id="s777">From Sachsenhausen, they used to take them almost daily to clear the rubble from Berlin after the bombardment.</span> <span id="s778">And he would tell me a story and he found it hilarious and the way he described it, it was hilarious.</span> <span id="s779">He was a very short man and he had two fellow prisoners who were giants compared to him.</span> <span id="s780">So he would always go with them because they would grab a beam and they would carry this beam and he, so that he doesn't have to carry anything, he would be in the middle and he would sort of hang on this beam.</span> <span id="s781">And, of course, this did not escape attention of one of the kapos, and they beat the daylights out of him.</span> <span id="s782">But when he was telling me this story, he wasn't telling it with sorrow.</span> <span id="s783">He was telling it as a funny episode that one would see in a..</span> <span id="s784">.</span> <span id="s785">Buster Keaton situation.</span> <span id="s786">Maybe I learned a little bit from ...from him.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: Okay, do you think there is anything else that you, now that we are going to finish, that you'd like to say anything else that maybe you thought of.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s789">I would like to.</span> <span id="s790">One thing disturbs me enormously now.</span> <span id="s791">As I mentioned to you, I am an advisor to the office of the President of Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s792">And some very unpleasant things are going on in Czechoslovakia at this moment.</span> <span id="s793">The Slovaks are striving for separatism, but they would like to pick up where they left off in 1945.</span> <span id="s794">So Monsignor Tiso who used to be the President of Slovakia under Hitler, installed by Hitler, tried after the war as a war criminal, executed as a war criminal.</span> <span id="s795">His memory is being revived now as a martyr.</span> <span id="s796">There are attempts to cannonize him.</span> <span id="s797">There are anti- Semitic episodes in Slovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">02:25:30 The man who was one of the driving forces behind the 1989 revolution in Slovakia...what Havel did in Prague this man did in Slovakia.</span> <span id="s799">His name is Feder Gor.</span> <span id="s800">He was born in Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s801">He's 46 years old.</span> <span id="s802">Three months ago, he had to leave Slovakia for England because he cannot walk the streets of Slovakia somebody not spitting in his face saying, "You dirty Jew.</span> <span id="s803">You should have died in the gas chambers.‚Äù</span> <span id="s804">I was in Germany 3 weeks ago, and I met with some Catholics who work for the Central Committee of Catholics in Germany.</span> <span id="s805">(Coughing) And I asked them...I said, "The whole world knows about this and the whole world that reads and follows political events in the newly emerging democracies in Europe.</span> <span id="s806">Why is it that in a country like Slovakia where a Catholic Church has such power, similar power as it has in Poland, nobody stands up and says anything?</span> <span id="s807">How come among you German Catholics nobody stands up and says, "Who was Monsigneur Tiso, and it is obscene to try to rehabilitate this man?</span> <span id="s808">How is it that you don't protest against the interviews given by some of the Slovak people in political power now who say....</span> <span id="s809">who refer to the alleged...this is a quote alleged deportation of Jews from Slovakia?</span> <span id="s810">So how come nobody's doing anything now when there is no Dachau any more for standing up and saying something?</span> <span id="s811">And there's just no answer to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q: Well, you've given us a wonderful account of the alleged atrocities which you experienced, and we thank you very much for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q: I thought it was a very dramatic close, but she wants to ask you a few more questions so let's see what she has to say.</span> <span id="s815">I understood that pretty well Linda.</span> <span id="s816">I don't think there's any problem about that from my... How he got from... I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s817">I really don't follow you, Linda.</span> <span id="s818">You'll have to repeat.</span> <span id="s819">Yeah.</span> <span id="s820">Linda wants a little more detail from you about how you got to Sharfia and what it was like for you as a child there.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">I'd like to have a little more detail about how you got to Sharfia, and what it was like for you...for you as a child there.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">A: To Sharfia.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s824">How you got there and what it was like there.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A: Well, Sharfia is a village very close to Piestany.</span> <span id="s826">The Pollacks used to have maid who came from Sharfia.</span> <span id="s827">When we were in Bardell, and we saw that we have to leave Bardio...becoming dangerous there, Simon Pollack thought of Sharfia as the place to...to go and hide.</span> <span id="s828">As I said, it was a ridiculous notion.</span> <span id="s829">Maybe one or two people could hide there, but to bring 40 people was suicidal.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q: How long were you there?</span> <span id="s831">A: Just a few weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">Q: And what was it like there...there during those few weeks in Sharfia?</span></p> <p><span id="s833">A: Well, I remember I was playing a lot with Thury, and the local boys were quite antagonistic towards us, so I came up with a story.</span> <span id="s834">I told them that we have a soccer ball, a real one, not one made out of fabric as they used in the village, and that I have soccer uniforms for two teams.</span> <span id="s835">And they thought here is this new kid.</span> <span id="s836">I was probably better dressed than they were, so I must have made an impression of a rich kid.</span> <span id="s837">And this brought out great respect for us, but I remember we were being nudged everyday where are the uniforms and I don't know what I keep telling them.</span> <span id="s838">Probably that it's coming, it's coming.</span> <span id="s839">And so these are some of the thoughts I remember.</span> <span id="s840">I also remember that we lived in very crammed quarters in somebody's house.</span> <span id="s841">I remember every time people had so many guests, wanted or unwanted, they resorted to killing a pig because that would feed many people.</span> <span id="s842">And I remember A funny episode.</span> <span id="s843">Simon Pollack lending a hand to the peasant killing this pig which had to be killed clandestinely at night.</span> <span id="s844">Otherwise, there was a forced portion that one had to give up to the...for the... I don't know.</span> <span id="s845">There was some central collecting system of food.</span> <span id="s846">Those are some of the things that I remember from my days.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s848">(Long, Long pause) The peasant who warned you of the pending massacre.</span> <span id="s849">How did that happen and what...in a kind of consecutive way, tell us about that story.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">02:33:</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s852">He must have come from the town of Piestany, and somebody must have spoken about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">Q: Tell us who came and how that came about.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">A: This was a man from the village who had a young son, also named Rudolph, and he went to Piestany and he must have heard from somebody that this Aktion is being prepared, that the Nazis are coming the following day.</span> <span id="s855">And I remember how they were pooh, poohing the idea.</span> <span id="s856">They said, "Well, tomorrow is Sunday.</span> <span id="s857">Nobody is going to come on Sunday and we have time.‚Äù</span> <span id="s858">But this is the father of this Rudolph.</span> <span id="s859">Incidentally, this Rudolph was a young boy, maybe 16, 17 and after the war when we returned Pollack took him in as an apprentice.</span> <span id="s860">And he worked for him in the dental lab as a apprentice until 1948 and in 1948 he was drafted into the military.</span> <span id="s861">Was already after the Communists have taken over power in Czechoslovakia, and he was a border guard and he escaped from Czechoslovakia and he came to this country and the Korean War started and they drafted him and he fell in Korea.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">A: And he was the one who warned you about...</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Q: He was the one who warned us, who brought us then food, some food into the forest.</span> <span id="s864">A: You all went to the forest.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">Q: Between... Yes.</span> <span id="s866">This was between the massacre in Sharfia and between Linka taking us to her home.</span> <span id="s867">The young boy again had tremendous responsibility taken on him by getting some food in the first place.</span> <span id="s868">There was six of us.</span> <span id="s869">It was quite a group to feed.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s872">What do you want?</span> <span id="s873">Uh...You were in the forest how long is it?</span> <span id="s874">When you were hiding in the forest?</span></p> <p><span id="s875">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: Tell us about that.</span> <span id="s877">Say, "When I was in the forest," and then describe what it was like, whether you were hungry, whether there were fights, what the events were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: Well, when I was in the forest, there was several incidences that I remember.</span> <span id="s879">First of all, the weather was not good.</span> <span id="s880">It was raining quite often.</span> <span id="s881">And we had just a blanket that they somehow tried to put over a small clearing</span></p> <p><span id="s882">02:36:20 and make a tent like structure, but what bothered me the most were these quarrels going on between these two adults.</span> <span id="s883">And that was the time when Simon's son, Marcell, left to look whether we could get to the Partisans.</span> <span id="s884">So these two men were left there.</span> <span id="s885">There were two children, and two women and it was a very difficult time because they behaved like two brats.</span> <span id="s886">But I also forgot to mention that when Marcel failed to return, they sensed that he was caught so his mother was hysterical constantly and Simon became hysterical as well and would pretend that he's going to commit suicide.</span> <span id="s887">That means he would take a pocket knife and make sure that all of us saw it and ran into the bushes and his wife would send me to take care of him so he doesn't commit suicide.</span> <span id="s888">I remember how angry I was because I was 8 or 9.</span> <span id="s889">I did not verbalize it that way, but I remember it.</span> <span id="s890">I felt somebody should take care of me and here I have this idiot pretending that he is going to commit suicide and instead of me being able to look for some food or for something, I have to babysit for him.</span> <span id="s891">I am sure not put it in those words, but I remember that my anger was...</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: You were a child having to baby an adult.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s894">But it was of no use at that point, as he proved to be of use in other instances, like in Nitra when he knew to do something useful to fix their teeth which kept us in Nitra so, again, he was a figure up and down in my books.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">Q: "Say when I was in the barn," and then go in and describe what it was like.</span> <span id="s896">You as a child, what was life in the barn like and what did you feel there?</span></p> <p><span id="s897">A: In the barn I remember the worst thing about it was, again, the quarrel between those two men, and I also remember the brother of Simon was an extremely religious man.</span> <span id="s898">And we had very little to eat and this peasant must have had a terrible time, Linka's father, must have had a terrible time to get food for us.</span> <span id="s899">And we were hungry.</span> <span id="s900">Somehow...I don't know why, but Simon's brother...first of all, he had the money that I was talking about that appeared and suddenly when they were throwing it out the window, but he also had some durable food.</span> <span id="s901">Specifically, he had bacon.</span> <span id="s902">And he would ask Ary, my age and his wife, whose name was Irene.</span> <span id="s903">I remember the words and I remember as if it was yesterday.</span> <span id="s904">He'd say, Irinka willst Du Speck.</span> <span id="s905">Do you want bacon?</span> <span id="s906">And, again, I remember the anger that he would not ask me or Simon or his wife whether we want something to eat.</span> <span id="s907">That's number one.</span> <span id="s908">And number two, I remember thinking already at that time, "If you are such a religious man, how come you're stuffing yourself with bacon?"</span> <span id="s909">Maybe I thought about this only after the war.</span> <span id="s910">I don't know.</span> <span id="s911">I cannot recall exactly whether these were my thoughts, but he was asking in such a provocative way that I knew that I would have wanted to hit him.</span> <span id="s912">I disliked the man as you can see.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Q: Uh...Go over again the time you were captured.</span> <span id="s914">The sequence when you heard the the noise overhead.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">A: We were hidden in that hut.</span> <span id="s916">Q: Do it in detail.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A: A few hours before that and I remember we were laying on the floor and really despondent because at that point we did not know what...what to do.</span> <span id="s918">And suddenly just out of the blue, there was this crashing noise, the roof tiles breaking and followed very shortly by strong kicking or banging on the door.</span> <span id="s919">I believe somebody smashed the door and we just...I remember hearing the words ven, ven which is in Slovak.</span> <span id="s920">Out.</span> <span id="s921">Out.</span> <span id="s922">And we went very fast.</span> <span id="s923">They assembled us.</span> <span id="s924">There was this notion or gesture of start digging graves or a ditch.</span> <span id="s925">There was the hysterical reaction of the two men and much less from the women.</span> <span id="s926">Me just standing there and waiting with Ary, me not having shoes and the wife of Pollack urging me to put on shoes.</span> <span id="s927">I said, "Why?"</span> <span id="s928">I remember that that was the moment when I thought about God and I thought about this preposterous instruction that I should put on shoes.</span> <span id="s929">Then I remember the Hlinka guards throwing out our belongings from the window and what I failed to mention that when shortly afterwards, while we were still present there waiting, they threw in hand grenades and they set it on fire.</span> <span id="s930">This whole structure just burned.</span> <span id="s931">It was at the edge of the forest.</span> <span id="s932">There was a big clearing.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">And I see it burning and shortly afterwards, this motorcycle...this man on a motorcycle appeared, said something.</span> <span id="s934">Now, I know it was to take us to the prison of Nitra.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">02:44:</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Q: Did you felt that you are being taken to your death?</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: We felt we are being taken the same place where Thury was taken.</span> <span id="s938">But throughout this entire time, I did not have what would be an appropriate reaction to the realization this might be it.</span> <span id="s939">I was very calm.</span> <span id="s940">Maybe what contributed to it was that the man who was sitting next to me, that was either a Hlinka guard or it was one of the Germans, was basically kindly to me.</span> <span id="s941">He gave me something to eat.</span> <span id="s942">He sort of let me play with his gun.</span> <span id="s943">I believe I thought if it was so dark this would not be the scenario.</span> <span id="s944">Something to that effect.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: That it was so dark?</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: If it was...if the picture was so bleak, if the outcome would be so devastating... Q: He wouldn't be nice to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s947">A: This would not be the atmosphere in which it would take place.</span> <span id="s948">It would have to be sort of an overture that would be much more negative with no room left for anything resembling a spark of hope.</span> <span id="s949">And here somebody who is supposed to lead you to execution and supposed to be and...and in reality is behaving in a kindly way.</span> <span id="s950">Of course, today I would know better.</span> <span id="s951">I have an experience talking to an SS doctor.</span> <span id="s952">His name is Dr. Muntz who I believe still practices medicine near Munich who was one of the Auschwitz doctors tried in the Auschwitz trial in Krakow in 1947, the only one set free because he provably helped Jews.</span> <span id="s953">And he was not involved in the selection process.</span> <span id="s954">He was the head of the Institute of Hygiene attached to Berkinau.</span> <span id="s955">And he would tell me stories about Mengele, how they would walk and he said he enjoyed talking to Mengele because Mengele was never foaming at his mouth.</span> <span id="s956">He was always elegant, always thoughtful, always had interesting things to say, and as they were walking Moontz and Mengele....Mengele would say, "Wait, I just have to stop at my office.‚Äù</span> <span id="s957">So they would go together there, and there would be a beautiful little girl sitting and there would be some assistant obviously involved in some experiments or something, but the girl was very quiet.</span> <span id="s958">And Mengele would stroke her head and said: Ein huebsches Maedel and then he would take out a candy and give the child a candy and then they would depart, Muench and Mengele and just he would turn to the assistant, say: Jetzt geben Sie das Kind eine Spritze.</span> <span id="s959">Let's now give an injection to the child.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: Inject phenol into her heart.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s962">Within 5 minutes later, the child would be dead.</span> <span id="s963">So comparing this to my feelings on that truck, that it cannot be so bad when the man is nice to me is a foolish thought.</span> <span id="s964">But at the moment...at the moment when it happened it was a useful thought.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">Q: In Theresienstadt, you had a friend named Peter, would you say, "When I was in Theresienstadt, I..</span> <span id="s966">."</span></p> <p><span id="s967">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s968">Well, In Theresienstadt, I..</span> <span id="s969">.</span> <span id="s970">I did have a friend.</span> <span id="s971">His name was Peter Rothberger , and he wasn't really a close friend but his mother and the wife of Pollack they worked together in this Entwesung(?)</span> <span id="s972">.</span> <span id="s973">That means where transport arrived where people got deloused, showered, shaven.</span> <span id="s974">And Peter and I would roam the streams and take care of our needs, try to get food.</span> <span id="s975">I met Peter then after the war.</span> <span id="s976">I was in law school and he was studying philosophy but then somehow I lost contact with him.</span> <span id="s977">An interesting thing was that after the war whether it was with Peter or whether it was with this girl, Monica, that I mentioned, the daughter of the doctor, one couldn't talk the past with them.</span> <span id="s978">There was a complete denial on their part because there were so few of us that to start this conversation would mean to bring in the unpleasant realization that we are Jews, a real handful left because those who survived, most of them left for then Palestine between 45 and 48 before the creation of Israel.</span> <span id="s979">So there was few of us left that they did not want to hear that they were part of that.</span> <span id="s980">Matter of fact, I remember much later when I was working already as a lawyer in Prague, the entire office had one Jew.</span> <span id="s981">Everybody knew that he was a Jew except this one man.</span> <span id="s982">And I enjoyed teasing him.</span> <span id="s983">So when we would pass ech other in the corridor, I would say Sholem Aleichem and he would look at me and say, "You Fool.</span> <span id="s984">What are you saying.‚Äù</span> <span id="s985">That was the same with Peter.</span> <span id="s986">We just found after the war we had nothing to talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">Q: And you'd been so close there.</span> <span id="s988">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">Q: How about the New Year's Eve party in Theresienstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s990">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s991">Rosa, Simon's Pollack's wife, and Eva decided to make a New Year's Eve party.</span> <span id="s992">And somebody gave them a recipe to make cake out of bread.</span> <span id="s993">So they got some bread together.</span> <span id="s994">They were also in a privileged position to get more food because the transports that were arriving, some people had supplies.</span> <span id="s995">So they made a cake out of bread.</span> <span id="s996">And I remember we had a very nice New Year's Eve party.</span> <span id="s997">We were included.</span> <span id="s998">The two women had a room all for themselves.</span> <span id="s999">That was an indication of their privileged status.</span> <span id="s1000">But that's about all I remember about it.</span> <span id="s1001">Just that we had cake made out of bread.</span> <span id="s1002">I can still taste it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">Q: And this was just before Theresienstadt closed down?</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">A: This was still long before it closed down because it was beginning of January, and the transports with all these inmates of other camps were arriving in Theresienstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">Q: Did it seem normal or natural to you to have a jolly party at that time under those circumstances?</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">A: It wasn't.</span> <span id="s1007">There there wasn't singing or merriment.</span> <span id="s1008">It was...it just looked compared to the daily life, it looked very elegant because here you had separate quarters.</span> <span id="s1009">All of us...there were...I..</span> <span id="s1010">.</span> <span id="s1011">I have never seen ...never seen or I have just seldom seen just four people in one room.</span> <span id="s1012">The hall...when one visualizes it, it's always hundreds of people.</span> <span id="s1013">You never visualize or seldom visualize the situation where you are alone with somebody, talking alone with somebody.</span> <span id="s1014">Almost didn't exist!</span> <span id="s1015">There were always people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">Q: So being alone and being private was a blessed exception.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">A: It was already some sign of situation that denoted... affluence or except, exceptional well being.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">Q: How about the period when you were a lonely child in the Dutch children's barrack?</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">What was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">A: That was to be a stranger.</span> <span id="s1021">Actually in the later years, I thought a lot about it.</span> <span id="s1022">I was the only Czech child there among Dutch children.</span> <span id="s1023">And you suddenly become someone who is identified if not as an enemy then as a foreign body that doesn't belong.</span> <span id="s1024">I couldn't communicate with the Dutch children.</span> <span id="s1025">They were beating me up because I was on the third bunk and I had a problem.</span> <span id="s1026">I constantly had a cold and at night I would have accidents.</span> <span id="s1027">I would wet the bed and it all came down, and the one who was sleeping under me, even under the second person wasn't too happy with that.</span> <span id="s1028">They...</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">Q: You wet your bed from urinating or from?</span> <span id="s1030">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1031">And so they would beat me up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">Q: Did you wet your bed throughout this whole period.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">A: No.</span> <span id="s1034">The only time I remember was when I was in this Dutch home and maybe it happened once or twice.</span> <span id="s1035">But it did happen.</span> <span id="s1036">Also I had mumps when I was there.</span> <span id="s1037">And I remember almost exactly when it was because I remember I had mumps and the wife of Pollack came to visit me, and they got the news in the camp that Roosevelt died.</span> <span id="s1038">I remember her telling me this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: How did how was that news greeted by people.</span> <span id="s1040">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s1041">I don't know who else I..</span> <span id="s1042">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Q: Do you know who Roosevelt was?</span> <span id="s1044">02:55:25</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">A: I knew who Roosevelt was.</span> <span id="s1046">I knew who the Americans were.</span> <span id="s1047">I knew where the war fronts were because this was the the discussions of Theresienstadt, where the Russians are, where the Americans are.</span> <span id="s1048">People would bring it into this camp.</span> <span id="s1049">Would come on the trains, would come with the engineers of the trains.</span> <span id="s1050">I am sure it came from the Czech guards.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">Q: Was there a general reaction to...to news of Roosevelt death?</span> <span id="s1052">Did the adults there react to it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">A: I don't think so.</span> <span id="s1054">I think it was somewhere in first part of April and things were already pretty much determined what the outcome is going to be.</span> <span id="s1055">I don't recall any particular sadness or any particular reaction.</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1057">That's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">Conclusion of Interview</span></p></body></html>
