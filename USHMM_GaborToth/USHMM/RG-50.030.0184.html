and Polish, natural.</span> <span id="s28">Yeah.</span> <span id="s29">And we had a very happy home life.</span> <span id="s30">That's what I think.</span> <span id="s31">Very happy, yeah.</span> <span id="s32">And then the war came.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q:Tell me...tell me a little more abut your home life.</span> <span id="s34">Did you go to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A:Oh, sure.</span> <span id="s36">I went...I finished public school.</span> <span id="s37">I went to a Catholic school, which was the best school in our city.</span> <span id="s38">And then I..</span> <span id="s39">.</span> <span id="s40">and I went in the same time in the afternoons to a Hebrew school, for a few hours, where I got my Hebrew education--which is still very good.</span> <span id="s41">And then I started business school.</span> <span id="s42">And then the war came.</span> <span id="s43">And I didn't finish.</span> <span id="s44">I just had started.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q:Tell me about what happened when the Nazis...what happened when the war broke out?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A:I mean, they were talking about the war; and my father's concern was only that they're gonna take my brother--who is older than I am--and...and he's gonna get killed.</span> <span id="s47">That was the only concern.</span> <span id="s48">I mean, we didn't have a concern what's gonna happen, or the faintest idea what's gonna happen.</span> <span id="s49">And I..</span> <span id="s50">.</span> <span id="s51">I asked my mother, "Usually, how does a war really look?</span> <span id="s52">What happens?"</span> <span id="s53">And she told me her experience from the first world war.</span> <span id="s54">She said they were fighting near the railroad station.</span> <span id="s55">They brought up the wounded to the city.</span> <span id="s56">You know?</span> <span id="s57">And everybody sit in the house and they didn't go....</span> <span id="s58">And that was the war.</span> <span id="s59">But it wasn't like this.</span> <span id="s60">The first Friday when Germany declared war, they bombed our city.</span> <span id="s61">I remember we got ready.</span> <span id="s62">We...my father brought a few sacks of flour home and...and...and oil and sugar and tea and whatever; and we stacked it up all in the attic, you know.</span> <span id="s63">And they figured, "We're gonna stay here until the war is over, so at least we'll have food;" because they didn't know how it's gonna turn out.</span> <span id="s64">But it wasn't like this.</span> <span id="s65">On Friday, when the...Germany crossed the Polish border...they declared war and they crossed the German border.</span> <span id="s66">Right away, they bombed our city.</span> <span id="s67">My father came running home from his business and he said, "It's very bad.</span> <span id="s68">It's very bad."</span> <span id="s69">And we ran all to the fields.</span> <span id="s70">And I remembered the...the corn.</span> <span id="s71">The fields were cut already, because when was in...in...September.</span> <span id="s72">And I got my...feet got all scratched up and hurt.</span> <span id="s73">And then we came home, and it quiet down.</span> <span id="s74">And a few days later the Russians came to us.</span> <span id="s75">Not the Germans.</span> <span id="s76">Because they made some kind of an agreement that the Russians will take this part, because we were so close to the River Bug.</span> <span id="s77">Maybe a week later, the Russians came and things weren't too bad.</span> <span id="s78">My father conducted his business again.</span> <span id="s79">And the Russian...being my father had...uh...had a wholesale from flour for the bakery, the Russians took over one of the bakeries that my father supplied; and the officer came to sleep to us, you know, in the house.</span> <span id="s80">And then came all of a sudden an order that they made some kind of a pact that the Russians should go back and the Germans would come here.</span> <span id="s81">And he insisted and he begged my father to take his children and to go with the Russian army to Russia.</span> <span id="s82">"You know," he said, "the Germans are going to come.</span> <span id="s83">They...they're gonna do awful things to you."</span> <span id="s84">They knew, but we didn't.</span> <span id="s85">"And you have young children.</span> <span id="s86">They can go there in to Russia.</span> <span id="s87">They can study, and they can work, and you'll be alright."</span> <span id="s88">My father and my mother thought, "Here...here we have our home.</span> <span id="s89">We have our furniture.</span> <span id="s90">We have our things.</span> <span id="s91">We have our Passover dishes.</span> <span id="s92">We have these things."</span> <span id="s93">You know, at home.</span> <span id="s94">And we didn't want to go.</span> <span id="s95">My father didn't want to go.</span> <span id="s96">He said, "I didn't do nothing wrong.</span> <span id="s97">Why should I run?"</span> <span id="s98">You know, people who belong to the communist party or whatever, they ran.</span> <span id="s99">But we didn't have... my father said he doesn't have a reason why to run.</span> <span id="s100">He didn't go.</span> <span id="s101">And then the Germans took over.</span> <span id="s102">And when the first unit of Gestapo came into our city, they rounded up all the professionals, all the rich people, all the well-known people, all not-so-rich people, quite a few hundred...and they marched them out from the city.</span> <span id="s103">My brother went with my father, to be with him.</span> <span id="s104">They marched him out from the city in the...in the direction of Hrubiesz贸w.</span> <span id="s105">That was where... Hrubiesz贸w.</span> <span id="s106">And on the way they shot them all.</span> <span id="s107">One by one.</span> <span id="s108">They couldn't walk.</span> <span id="s109">They walked for a few days; and they shot my father, too.</span> <span id="s110">My brother pretended to be dead.</span> <span id="s111">And after they left, he had a wounded foot.</span> <span id="s112">He got into Be__ec.</span> <span id="s113">All the way...that's past Hrubiesz贸w.</span> <span id="s114">It was a village.</span> <span id="s115">Be__ec.</span> <span id="s116">And he hid there by a family, and got word to us that he's there.</span> <span id="s117">My mother went and brought him home.</span> <span id="s118">We nursed him, and he came back.</span> <span id="s119">That's how I lost my father.</span> <span id="s120">In 1939.</span> <span id="s121">He was 41 years old.</span> <span id="s122">And my mother, when they took us to Sobib贸r, we...we were...we kept my mother with us in Siedliszcze.</span> <span id="s123">We used to hide her during the day.</span> <span id="s124">In the evening, she came out.</span> <span id="s125">Because in Siedliszcze, in camp, we could go home.</span> <span id="s126">They made like a ghetto...like a section we could come home to sleep.</span> <span id="s127">In the morning we went again so we...we succeeded in keeping our mother from '40...late '40 until '42, until they took us to Staw[-Nowosiolki, NB: labor camp in the Lublin district].</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q:Thank you.</span> <span id="s129">Let's...let's...uh...I just a little confused.</span> <span id="s130">Let's go back to Che_m and to you before we move on to the camps.</span> <span id="s131">Tell me what you did when you were still in Che_m.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A:Uh...During the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q:During the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A:Yeah, I..</span> <span id="s135">.</span> <span id="s136">I was the only.</span> <span id="s137">I had to help out.</span> <span id="s138">We had a little money and we had things that my father accumulated and we lived on that.</span> <span id="s139">We didn't live in the ghetto yet so we lived in our own house.</span> <span id="s140">My mother and I, we used to do little bit knitting and sew and make a little bit money with it, you know?</span> <span id="s141">That's the only thing my mother knew how to do is to knit very well.</span> <span id="s142">So she used to knit for the Polish people, for the Germans.</span> <span id="s143">They used to give her sugar for it, eggs.</span> <span id="s144">And then we could exchange this for other things.</span> <span id="s145">So things weren't too bad.</span> <span id="s146">And then I had two Polish families who were customers, my father's customers.</span> <span id="s147">And they really came forward with helping us, while we were....</span> <span id="s148">One wife, one baker who had the bakery shop, you know, bakery....</span> <span id="s149">She used to put everyday behind the fence where they had the bakery, a loaf of bread and a bag of coal--they used to bake with the wood and the coal--and a little bag with the flour, every day, and we picked it up.</span> <span id="s150">That was a fortune, because half we sold and could buy other things and half we used for ourselves.</span> <span id="s151">And then we had another one who later saved our lives.</span> <span id="s152">He used to help us out also a lot.</span> <span id="s153">He was very upset that they killed my father.</span> <span id="s154">He said, "If they killed your father, they took my luck away."</span> <span id="s155">He believed so strongly in my father.</span> <span id="s156">We were very closely friends with this one.</span> <span id="s157">The children were close.</span> <span id="s158">The parents were close.</span> <span id="s159">We didn't...my...he didn't do nothing with...there goes back a story, which I'll get back to it later, how that relationship started.</span> <span id="s160">But he helped us survive, too; which was much easier than other families because if they had businesses and they had goods and that, they had to give up everything.</span> <span id="s161">You had to give up.</span> <span id="s162">You had to give up if you any forks...you had to give up if you had any silver, you had to give up if you had any gold.</span> <span id="s163">And the money was worthless.</span> <span id="s164">So the only way you could survive if you had something to exchange.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q:So they helped you?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A:Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q:When did it start?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A:Go ahead.</span> <span id="s169">Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q:When did it start to get very bad?</span> <span id="s171">What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A:It started to get very bad the beginning of '41, when they made the ghetto.</span> <span id="s173">They made the ghetto; and all of a sudden they...uh...decided that all the Jews from the city have to move into one section.</span> <span id="s174">And they had to leave...we had to leave, like in a couple of hours.</span> <span id="s175">You could take only what you could take on your...back or in your hands.</span> <span id="s176">And they put us in with a woman with six children, in a room with a kitchen.</span> <span id="s177">And my mother wasn't a well woman, all those years that I can remember.</span> <span id="s178">And she couldn't...the poor woman couldn't sleep and she couldn't...and she says, "I cannot stand it in..." You know, with my father gone, she lost a lot of will to live, I would say.</span> <span id="s179">And we decided, being we had family in Siedliszcze.</span> <span id="s180">At that time it wasn't a camp yet.</span> <span id="s181">It was just a village.</span> <span id="s182">So they let us know that we should come there.</span> <span id="s183">There's no ghetto.</span> <span id="s184">And we could stay there with them.</span> <span id="s185">There's plenty.</span> <span id="s186">So we packed up and we went, and we left Che_m and we went to Siedliszce.</span> <span id="s187">And there, it wasn't so bad.</span> <span id="s188">My brother worked in the mill, you know?</span> <span id="s189">And if he worked night shift, he used to steal some flour and some...uh... what's it called?</span> <span id="s190">Cream of wheat.</span> <span id="s191">You know?</span> <span id="s192">He used to put it in the cemetery behind the milk, and I used to go and pick it up at night.</span> <span id="s193">And it wasn't too bad.</span> <span id="s194">Once in awhile the gendarmerie--not the real Gestapo--used to come, and they would rob and they would steal.</span> <span id="s195">They would take away whatever you had, but you could live.</span> <span id="s196">And we stayed there until...and then they made the camp out of Siedliszcze, and again a ghetto.</span> <span id="s197">So we moved in also with an old lady in one room.</span> <span id="s198">But at that time I guess my mother got used to the conditions, and I guess the circumstances made her stronger and healthier, that she could go on.</span> <span id="s199">I don't know how, but she did.</span> <span id="s200">And we stayed...we used to go both to work, my brother and I. And she remained at home hidden.</span> <span id="s201">In the evening she came out and we were together.</span> <span id="s202">In the morning, the same thing; and that... that almost a year we were there with her.</span> <span id="s203">And then we heard that in May of 1942, they started with the Judenrein, you know, all of Poland.</span> <span id="s204">I don't know about Europe, but I, ah...Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q:Excuse me.</span> <span id="s206">Do you mean Judenrat or Judenrein?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A:Judenrein.</span> <span id="s208">Judenrein.</span> <span id="s209">Judenrats, they were all over in the meanwhile.</span> <span id="s210">Judenrein.</span> <span id="s211">And my aunt...and we knew that we're not gonna stay too much longer.</span> <span id="s212">So my mother's sisters from Che_m, which remained in Che_m, let us know if they should take us young--like my brother and myself--to a camp, Mom should come to them, because they believed they're gonna be there over the winter and maybe....</span> <span id="s213">So we left my mother... and all of a sudden one morning, you know, they didn't warn you or they didn't prepare you, one morning you're going away.</span> <span id="s214">So we packed up whatever we could, and my mother we hid; and she said at night she will go out, and she'll find a way to get to Che_m back to be with the family--because they told us that no older people...older people...she was probably 40 or 41 cannot go...just young people.</span> <span id="s215">The people who worked in Siedliszcze.</span> <span id="s216">So my brother and I left, and it seems that my mother couldn't get in touch with her sisters because in the meanwhile they took them.</span> <span id="s217">They took everybody at the same time.</span> <span id="s218">And she got tired of sitting.</span> <span id="s219">That we found out after the war.</span> <span id="s220">Somebody who survived in Siedliszcze, that she went over to the police station and ask them they should shoot her and they shot her.</span> <span id="s221">That was the end.</span> <span id="s222">We didn't find out 'til after the war.</span> <span id="s223">And my brother and I, we started our march from Siedliszcze.</span> <span id="s224">We didn't know, but it was to start in Nowosiolki, what I told you.</span> <span id="s225">You know?</span> <span id="s226">And I had a bundle and I grabbed whatever I could...new things and old things, because we felt...my mother said, "Take it.</span> <span id="s227">Maybe you'll be able to exchange for some...." You know in Europe, like my mother...she had old linen from my brother, and everything for the dowry in case....</span> <span id="s228">You know, like they got ready for these things.</span> <span id="s229">And I had...I had a heavy coat on and I had those bundles and my brother had....</span> <span id="s230">And when I came to Nowosiolki, they...uh...rounded us up and they made in threes or in twos, and they started picking out who is going to go to work and who not.</span> <span id="s231">And as it came up to me, from that walk probably wading 40 kilometers in the mud.</span> <span id="s232">That was October.</span> <span id="s233">You know, in Poland, and the villages, I got...I turned yellow from aggravation.</span> <span id="s234">I turned yellow as a young girl.</span> <span id="s235">And when I came in front of those who selected...you know, who should go here, who should go there.</span> <span id="s236">So they put me with the old people.</span> <span id="s237">But one mistress of one of the Nazis who did that selecting was from Che_m, a Polish girl.</span> <span id="s238">And I went over and I said, "[Lee (ph)], look what they did to me."</span> <span id="s239">She says, "Come out."</span> <span id="s240">When I came out, she rubbed a little lipstick on my cheeks.</span> <span id="s241">I was always very fortunate.</span> <span id="s242">Luck was with me.</span> <span id="s243">I can't say no.</span> <span id="s244">She rubbed a little lipstick.</span> <span id="s245">She said, "Take off the babushka."</span> <span id="s246">You know, I had a babushka; and she pushed me in again at the end of the line.</span> <span id="s247">And I went through with the young people.</span> <span id="s248">And they picked me out and the rest went; and they took us in to Staw-Nowosiolki.</span> <span id="s249">Staw-Nowosiolki, the conditions were unbelievable bad.</span> <span id="s250">So bad that one ate the other one alive almost, you know?</span> <span id="s251">No food.</span> <span id="s252">We were all pushed into one building.</span> <span id="s253">On top were the men.</span> <span id="s254">On the bottom the women.</span> <span id="s255">Filthy.</span> <span id="s256">Dirty.</span> <span id="s257">You know?</span> <span id="s258">Winter, they took us every day to work.</span> <span id="s259">You had to walk at least... you walked 30, 35 kilometers a day.</span> <span id="s260">We didn't have the proper clothing.</span> <span id="s261">You know?</span> <span id="s262">And I worked there for two months, and it were few people left over from the previous people.</span> <span id="s263">And they said, "Here is the last stage.</span> <span id="s264">From here you go to Sobib贸r."</span> <span id="s265">That's where we really found out about Sobib贸r, you know?</span> <span id="s266">We heard the rumors in May, when they send out some people from Siedliszcze, but just slight rumors.</span> <span id="s267">But there they told us that from here you go to Sobib贸r, and that's the end.</span> <span id="s268">And we were there...I was there for two months.</span> <span id="s269">They gave us once a day a piece of bread, some potatoes--with the sand, with the peels, with a little water--but we had still some things from home, so we could....</span> <span id="s270">Those who were from before, they had certain privileges.</span> <span id="s271">So they used to go into the countryside and exchange or buy; so we used to buy a little bit, you know?</span> <span id="s272">But the conditions were unbearable.</span> <span id="s273">You couldn't wash yourself.</span> <span id="s274">I remember my friend [NB: Hella Felenbaum or Zelda Metz] and myself; she escaped from Sobib贸r, too.</span> <span id="s275">She's not alive anymore.</span> <span id="s276">There was a river flowing behind that building.</span> <span id="s277">We used to go out at night and break the ice in order to be able to wash ourself.</span> <span id="s278">We didn't catch cold again.</span> <span id="s279">We didn't catch cold.</span> <span id="s280">Isn't that amazing?</span> <span id="s281">We didn't have no vitamins.</span> <span id="s282">Nothing!</span> <span id="s283">And there I was for two months.</span> <span id="s284">Those were the worst two months.</span> <span id="s285">I mean, except for Sobib贸r.</span> <span id="s286">You know?</span> <span id="s287">And one night they surrounded us, and they loaded us up early in the morning on horse and wagons.</span> <span id="s288">The farmers brought it.</span> <span id="s289">And then we knew where we are going.</span> <span id="s290">You know?</span> <span id="s291">But still...how should I say?</span> <span id="s292">I never could see myself dead.</span> <span id="s293">Is that stupid?</span> <span id="s294">Yeah?</span> <span id="s295">No?</span> <span id="s296">I never could see...I always felt somehow I'll get out of it.</span> <span id="s297">And then I heard that my brother jumped from the second floor, and he ran away.</span> <span id="s298">So I figured at least one of us survive.</span> <span id="s299">It's better than nothing.</span> <span id="s300">Because he had no way of getting to me.</span> <span id="s301">You understand?</span> <span id="s302">And they loaded us up on the wagons--was even dark yet--and they started going and going and we rode in those wagons a whole day, you know?</span> <span id="s303">In Europe...in those muds, and the wagons got stuck and you had to go out...help pull them out; and finally I figured, "My God, I wish it could be over!"</span> <span id="s304">But I couldn't see myself dead, again.</span> <span id="s305">And then when we came before Sobib贸r all the way, the Polish farmers-- they knew what's going on, you know, and they looked at us.</span> <span id="s306">Some were happy.</span> <span id="s307">Some didn't care, or whatever.</span> <span id="s308">And we arrived at Sobib贸r, was dark already.</span> <span id="s309">That was the 22nd of December 1942.</span> <span id="s310">And they started unloading us with dogs and with...they always barked.</span> <span id="s311">The Nazis didn't talk.</span> <span id="s312">They barked like dogs, you know?</span> <span id="s313">You couldn't even make out what they're saying, although I spoke very well German.</span> <span id="s314">You know?</span> <span id="s315">And they loaded us up on the ramp in front of the...on the railroad station, and all of a sudden I see one of my friends.</span> <span id="s316">She was a tall girl.</span> <span id="s317">They came from Silesia.</span> <span id="s318">They spoke very well German.</span> <span id="s319">Her mother was a professor.</span> <span id="s320">And she goes by with Wagner [NB: Oberscharf眉hrer Gustav Wagner], and she points at this one and she points at this one.</span> <span id="s321">And I said, "Mira, what are you looking for?"</span> <span id="s322">She said, "I'm looking for girls who know how to knit."</span> <span id="s323">I said, "What's about my talent?"</span> <span id="s324">And she points to him and he took me out.</span> <span id="s325">They took out eight girls and I think two men from the whole 800, and the rest--the next morning we...we saw their clothing and everything.</span> <span id="s326">And next they took us out and he marched us in to the camp.</span> <span id="s327">The camp made a terrible impression.</span> <span id="s328">FIrst of all, the smell from the bodies.</span> <span id="s329">Although I don't...I didn't believe it.</span> <span id="s330">I didn't believe it.</span> <span id="s331">I just thought it's a smell, you know?</span> <span id="s332">And you saw the fire.</span> <span id="s333">Because the whole grounds where the camp was...were, were very small.</span> <span id="s334">Very small.</span> <span id="s335">And they took us into a empty barrack.</span> <span id="s336">And then came in the commandant...the Jewish commandant of the lag...of the camp, and he told us, "Do you know what here is?"</span> <span id="s337">We said, "No."</span> <span id="s338">First of all, we were afraid to say that we know.</span> <span id="s339">We...you had to be careful you didn't know where you are.</span> <span id="s340">And he said, "Look at the fire."</span> <span id="s341">And he explained us, and I just listened.</span> <span id="s342">I didn't say yes or no.</span> <span id="s343">I didn't agree and I didn't disagree.</span> <span id="s344">And they put...brought in some blankets and they brought us in some bread; and I said, "At least, I'll get my last meal (laughing) and I get a place to sleep."</span> <span id="s345">And the next morning they builded a room for us, with...uh...bunk beds, you know.</span> <span id="s346">And they brought in lots of wool and they told us, "You have to make one knee sock a day," which wasn't bad.</span> <span id="s347">We used to do it.</span> <span id="s348">Then one day, they took us to sorting and we saw all this and we just...it was a very difficult to accept...very difficult to get adjusted.</span> <span id="s349">You...you...you don't understand.</span> <span id="s350">Very difficult to find your place in there.</span> <span id="s351">You...you didn't know whom to believe, and who you didn't believe and what to do and what to say.</span> <span id="s352">And I remember in our Strickstube [Translation: "knitting barrack" (Ger.)]</span> <span id="s353">, where we used to do the knitting, was a young boy.</span> <span id="s354">His mother came out with us.</span> <span id="s355">And she was related to the real Rothschilds, from Vienna.</span> <span id="s356">He was 16 years old and he knew how to knit perfect.</span> <span id="s357">He said, "Esther, this is it.</span> <span id="s358">You can give me your food, too.</span> <span id="s359">You...you won't survive.</span> <span id="s360">Nobody will survive."</span> <span id="s361">He was 16 years old.</span> <span id="s362">He could eat for three, you know.</span> <span id="s363">Not for one.</span> <span id="s364">I said, "Listen, I am not gonna give nothing away because I'm not going to the frying pan."</span> <span id="s365">We used to call it [NB: the gas chamber] the "frying pan."</span> <span id="s366">I said, "You see the boots?"</span> <span id="s367">I came with them...I still came with brown leather boots.</span> <span id="s368">At the movie, one of the survivors reminded me...said, "You remember your brown, leather boots?"</span> <span id="s369">I said, "These boots I'm putting away underneath my hat," we had on the bunk.</span> <span id="s370">"And with these boots, I'm gonna run away from here.</span> <span id="s371">Don't ask me how.</span> <span id="s372">I don't know.</span> <span id="s373">But I'm gonna make it."</span> <span id="s374">He said, "You're gonna fry together with us."</span> <span id="s375">You...you know?</span> <span id="s376">Those were the small talk.</span> <span id="s377">And I worked in the Strickstube maybe four weeks or so; and then they accumulated so much stuff from the fall...in the beginning of the winter, from the transports, because they were so busy.</span> <span id="s378">They...they had a terrific business going there that they accumulated outside, and this had to be cleaned up and sorted out before spring.</span> <span id="s379">And they had also...in the wintertime, in the beginning, they just put the bodies in an open ditch.</span> <span id="s380">And then they realized that it started smelling, so then they built...not ovens.</span> <span id="s381">They had pits there.</span> <span id="s382">Not ovens.</span> <span id="s383">And they started digging out with cranes all those bodies, and burning them.</span> <span id="s384">You know?</span> <span id="s385">And I worked in...every day just...that the revenge feeling builded up that you were ready to bust.</span> <span id="s386">I mean, here you have to put a smile.</span> <span id="s387">When they tell you something, you have to pretend that you're so glad you can do it for them.</span> <span id="s388">But inside it was terrible.</span> <span id="s389">And two months later or three months after I came, Leon Feldhendler came.</span> <span id="s390">He was a cousin of mine.</span> <span id="s391">With another transport they took him out.</span> <span id="s392">And when he came and we started talking, he said, "We have to do something.</span> <span id="s393">We have to escape.</span> <span id="s394">Because we have to revenge and there has to be a way."</span> <span id="s395">And I think that kept us going, although we didn't believe that somebody will make it.</span> <span id="s396">Nobody in his right mind...I mean it was foolish.</span> <span id="s397">But we felt that planning and that talking kept us, you know, gave us courage to live through a day...another day, you know?</span> <span id="s398">And every day there were new things besides the routine that you never got used to it, but it became a way of life.</span> <span id="s399">That the transports come.</span> <span id="s400">They killed the people.</span> <span id="s401">You see them running naked.</span> <span id="s402">And then you...you sort out their belongings.</span> <span id="s403">But there were other things that happened every day.</span> <span id="s404">They took out this one from us, because maybe he didn't look straight in the face, and shot him in front of us; or two guys escaped.</span> <span id="s405">They dug a hole underneath the barrack; and then they took us out, and they took every tenth one.</span> <span id="s406">You know, we were more like a family; and everyone that they took out, it was just like they tore out.</span> <span id="s407">Because we figured we're losing everybody on the outside whom they bring in.</span> <span id="s408">But those are people that we go through the worse in our lives, and we stick together and one tries to help each other...uh... physically sometimes and morally for sure.</span> <span id="s409">You...you understand?</span> <span id="s410">And some shared the food.</span> <span id="s411">And if you know somebody works harder, we saw to it that he should get some more than we did where we could get along with less.</span> <span id="s412">And then every transport, when you heard that whistle, it's very difficult to explain.</span> <span id="s413">It's just like tore your insides out.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q:Tell us about the transports.</span> <span id="s415">You told me about before about the transports from Be__ec and an incident with Frenzel.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s417">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q:Tell me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A:You see and then...in March, I think, Himmler came to visit the camp; and at that time they brought 400 young girls from Majdanek, to show him how efficient and good they are at killing.</span> <span id="s420">And I remember...and that's the first time when they started to shave the hair by those people...by the women.</span> <span id="s421">And when Himmler came...and there was a rumor, you know...the SS people in the camp always like--through a word, you know, either when they were drunk or whatever...they said a word.</span> <span id="s422">Then you put two together, and you made out something of it.</span> <span id="s423">You know?</span> <span id="s424">You didn't answer.</span> <span id="s425">You pretended you don't hear, but sometimes....</span> <span id="s426">And then they were so sure of us, that we are not going to go out and tell somebody.</span> <span id="s427">You know?</span> <span id="s428">They knew we are...whenever they can...want to finish us, they can finish us.</span> <span id="s429">We're in their hands.</span> <span id="s430">So after Himmler came, they said that Be__ec and Treblinka they're gonna close up; because this is most secret and the most efficient camp from all the camps.</span> <span id="s431">So one day they locked us in, and we knew if they lock us in something is going on out of the ordinary...out of transport, and so.</span> <span id="s432">And they brought the inmates from Be__ec, and we knew the next day that those were the inmates, and they killed them off in Sobib贸r and they closed up Be__ec.</span> <span id="s433">Because the next day when we sorted out their clothing, we found notes in their clothing; because we used to check very careful the clothing.</span> <span id="s434">First for documents, you know--to see from where the...the transport comes, who came, how many came, and sometimes you had very interesting notes.</span> <span id="s435">So we always checked.</span> <span id="s436">We had to check, anyway, everything for valuables and give it to them.</span> <span id="s437">And we found...and they...and the main thing in their notes were--we couldn't do it--but "please revenge us" and "please revenge us" and all those cries and....</span> <span id="s438">And then awhile later, not long, they brought the inmates from Treblinka, and they locked us in again.</span> <span id="s439">And they shot them one by one.</span> <span id="s440">You could count the shots.</span> <span id="s441">Because they were afraid.</span> <span id="s442">You know?</span> <span id="s443">Don't forget there were only like at one time 11, 12 SS people, and probably about 200...at that time maybe not even 200 Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s444">They were afraid.</span> <span id="s445">So they figured, it's safer to shoot every one separately than to take the whole, all of them, to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s446">And then we found again notes in their clothing.</span> <span id="s447">And letters, and names, and lists, and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s448">And they brought them to Sobib贸r to finish.</span> <span id="s449">And that's when Sobib贸r became very busy.</span> <span id="s450">Business was booming at that time.</span> <span id="s451">Three transports, four transports, day and night.</span> <span id="s452">It really became sometimes unbearable.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q:What was the camp like when it was so busy, as you put it?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A:We had to work 14, 16, 18 hours a day from early...we used to have roll call, in the summertime even....in the spring it was still dark.</span> <span id="s455">Like 3 o'clock in the morning, 4 o'clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s456">And then they marched us off to work about 5, 5:30, 6:00.</span> <span id="s457">And then we worked through all sorts of hours because ...and if they needed us after we...they took us again.</span> <span id="s458">Yeah.</span> <span id="s459">I mean, it was very difficult.</span> <span id="s460">You know, when you stay in that barrack and you sort the clothes, and the barracks were arranged from this side and the other side where the people left their belongings in the middle.</span> <span id="s461">They used to walk through.</span> <span id="s462">When you see those people, and you cannot even tell them where they're going.</span> <span id="s463">You know, it...it wasn't easy.</span> <span id="s464">I don't know how I preserved my sanity or somebody else...not just myself.</span> <span id="s465">You...you...you understand?</span> <span id="s466">Like when I came it was more primitive; so when a transport arrived and they told them to leave their belongings, everything went on outside.</span> <span id="s467">Not inside.</span> <span id="s468">Later, was built inside.</span> <span id="s469">And there was a Oberscharf眉hrer [Hermann] Michel.</span> <span id="s470">And he would go out and out and started, "[Juden, you denkte gelunkheit (ph)]."</span> <span id="s471">You know?</span> <span id="s472">And he said, "You came...you came here and...and we'll put you to work, and work is good for you.</span> <span id="s473">And you just leave here the belongings, and everything is going to be disinfected."</span> <span id="s474">They even had a wall with nails where everybody hung up his belonging.</span> <span id="s475">German efficiency.</span> <span id="s476">(Sigh) And they said, "You just get undressed and you'll go and take your shower and disinfection, because we don't want any sicknesses."</span> <span id="s477">We used to call Michel "the Baldarshn" [Translation: "the Preacher" (Yiddish)].</span> <span id="s478">You know what the Baldarshn is?</span> <span id="s479">Like you have...uh....in a synagogue.</span> <span id="s480">Somebody who tells you what.</span> <span id="s481">.</span> <span id="s482">what to read.</span> <span id="s483">I'll get the word for it.</span> <span id="s484">But later on, they didn't even bother with this.</span> <span id="s485">They didn't...they were so busy that they just built three barracks like...like.</span> <span id="s486">.</span> <span id="s487">uh.</span> <span id="s488">.</span> <span id="s489">across you know.</span> <span id="s490">So on this side they used to unload the stuff in there...and the middle the people used to go through.</span> <span id="s491">And it was very difficult to watch.</span> <span id="s492">You know, you see people normal people--children, women, men--and...and you know a half hour later they won't be here.</span> <span id="s493">Why?</span> <span id="s494">You ask yourself, why?</span> <span id="s495">And it's very difficult not to say anything.</span> <span id="s496">Those people there were not in that war for Germany.</span> <span id="s497">They didn't do nothing wrong.</span> <span id="s498">They were law abiding people.</span> <span id="s499">Why?</span> <span id="s500">Why those children?</span> <span id="s501">I mean like Gomerski [NB: Oberscharf眉hrer Hubert Gomerski].</span> <span id="s502">I was at his trial too.</span> <span id="s503">He got life sentence also.</span> <span id="s504">I mean he called them...we used to call him "the Doctor."</span> <span id="s505">When it came a transport, he used to walk around with a white coat.</span> <span id="s506">You know?</span> <span id="s507">And they used...he only asked who is sick and who is unable, who cannot walk, he wants to help everybody.</span> <span id="s508">And they had those...uh...lorries ...I don't know how...yeah?</span> <span id="s509">And they would just throw them in like garbage; and on the way to Camp 3 [NB: where the gas chambers were located] to the...he would shot half of them...shoot half of them.</span> <span id="s510">And then when it came a big shot sometimes to visit, because they were such...they ran such a good operation, we used to go and clean the quarters.</span> <span id="s511">Because when nobody was there, they lived very luxuriously.</span> <span id="s512">But when somebody came, everything was hidden and they had to live like military people, you know.</span> <span id="s513">So once I..</span> <span id="s514">.</span> <span id="s515">I went to clean the house.</span> <span id="s516">It...it was called "Summlustigung Floh" [Translation: "Merrily Buzzing Flea" (German)], that house.</span> <span id="s517">Where a few SS people lived.</span> <span id="s518">And I cleaned and I put plain blankets and plain pillows and took off the table cloth and took off the silk sheets.</span> <span id="s519">You know, just put it in plain.</span> <span id="s520">And all of a sudden...usually when we were cleaning and somebody came or a transport, they put us back to the...but somehow everything happened so fast that they forgot about me with another girl.</span> <span id="s521">We were two girls there.</span> <span id="s522">And we stayed there.</span> <span id="s523">We knew we are not supposed to go out.</span> <span id="s524">And I hid behind the curtain.</span> <span id="s525">I wanted to see what's going on.</span> <span id="s526">And I saw the...the rail...the box cars coming in.</span> <span id="s527">Matter of fact, I was this summer the first time back in Sobib贸r.</span> <span id="s528">That house is still there.</span> <span id="s529">The railroad is there, and the box cars are there.</span> <span id="s530">You know?</span> <span id="s531">(Sigh) And as I watched I saw they're unloading the whole train.</span> <span id="s532">And the mother, I don't know for what reason, she left the baby in the box car.</span> <span id="s533">And...and she walked.</span> <span id="s534">You know they chased, and she ran away.</span> <span id="s535">And Frenzel--who was in charge most of the time of the Bahnhauskommanden [NB: the Bahnhofkommando], of the trains--he grabbed that little baby by the little feet and smashed his skull against the box car and...and just threw it in like a dead rat.</span> <span id="s536">And I think this will be with me until my last day.</span> <span id="s537">I just can't get over it.</span> <span id="s538">I..</span> <span id="s539">.</span> <span id="s540">I was at his trial twice.</span> <span id="s541">And I brought it out.</span> <span id="s542">He got life sentence, just for that one case.</span> <span id="s543">But he said I accused him falsely.</span> <span id="s544">But I told him in court, "Tell me that you didn't do it!"</span> <span id="s545">He didn't.</span> <span id="s546">What bothered me mostly...I went so many times to trials back to Germany, because I felt I owned it to those who didn't make it.</span> <span id="s547">That they admitted Sobib贸r.</span> <span id="s548">They admitted what happened there.</span> <span id="s549">They admitted that so many...so many people were killed there.</span> <span id="s550">They admitted the uprising, that so many and so many....</span> <span id="s551">But they never said it was wrong.</span> <span id="s552">You know?</span> <span id="s553">And that, I couldn't take it.</span> <span id="s554">And I told it many times in court, you know?</span> <span id="s555">Everybody followed orders, but nobody says that the...it was wrong.</span> <span id="s556">I remember I had an incident with Frenzel's lawyer in court.</span> <span id="s557">It was the first time when I accused him of that baby killing.</span> <span id="s558">He started, "Where did you stay, and what color was the drapes, and what color was here, and how far from there and how far from..." I said, "Listen, if I would put on a uniform on you, I saw you someplace as a Nazi.</span> <span id="s559">And one Nazi defends the other."</span> <span id="s560">And there was a big commotion.</span> <span id="s561">And they made intermission in court.</span> <span id="s562">And then that lawyer went, and he had some Jewish friend in Hagen and he came with him and he said, "You see.</span> <span id="s563">I'm not...I wasn't a Nazi.</span> <span id="s564">Here's my friend."</span> <span id="s565">I said, "If he's your friend, he's just like you."</span> <span id="s566">But later on in the retrial of Frenzel, it came out that that lawyer was a commandant in a POW camp.</span> <span id="s567">And I told him at that time, "If I would put a uniform on on you, I saw you someplace."</span> <span id="s568">I didn't see him.</span> <span id="s569">But, you know, I have in me...I developed that knowledge of people.</span> <span id="s570">I can smell it.</span> <span id="s571">I just smelled out that that lawyer, something is wrong.</span> <span id="s572">Because when I was at the trial from Gomerski and I told what Gomerski did, his lawyer got up--I have documents of that--and he said, "I defended the biggest murders in my life already, but here the art of defense gave up.</span> <span id="s573">I don't have nothing to say."</span> <span id="s574">He took off his robe and walked out.</span> <span id="s575">And that's when I had my first satisfaction--that somebody feels what I felt.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q:Tell me about Gomerski.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A:Gomerski, I went three time to Frankfurt to his trial.</span> <span id="s578">Gomerski claims...he...I mean, none of them denied that they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q:Tell me what you saw him doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A:He was called "the Doctor."</span> <span id="s581">And with every transport he would...he would dressed up...get dressed up like a doctor, and he would mainly take care of the old, of the sick, of the children, of the lonely.</span> <span id="s582">And they would throw them into lorries; and he would accompany them from the ramp to Camp 3, where it was the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s583">And on he way he would shoot half of them.</span> <span id="s584">He always, "Ich war Deutsche helfen.</span> <span id="s585">Ich war Deutsche helfen.</span> <span id="s586">Und w盲re istkang (ph).</span> <span id="s587">Ich war Deutsche helfen."</span> <span id="s588">[Translation: "I was to help Germans.</span> <span id="s589">I was to help Germans.</span> <span id="s590">And they were ______.</span> <span id="s591">I was to help Germans."]</span> <span id="s592">Miserable.</span> <span id="s593">But when you look into the past of those people, where they come from, that was the lowest element.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q:We need to pull back to your story to what you saw.</span> <span id="s595">Tell me a little more.</span> <span id="s596">What, besides the incident with the baby, things that you saw Frenzel do?</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A:Uh....</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q:Tell me about him.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A:You see there was another thing when the...they used to go...the Waldhofskommando [NB: the Waldkommando] used to go to the woods.</span> <span id="s600">And they always build.</span> <span id="s601">They always build.</span> <span id="s602">Because they figured you're more efficient and you're more good the camp will work, that they would stay a chance not to go to the Russian front.</span> <span id="s603">That was there...so they didn't care at what price, you know, just to remain there.</span> <span id="s604">So two went to get water.</span> <span id="s605">Mr. Hoenigman...and Mr. Hoenigman and Pod... [NB: Shlomo Podchlebnik].</span> <span id="s606">They're both not alive anymore.</span> <span id="s607">And they killed the Ukrainian who went with them.</span> <span id="s608">I worked...at that time, I worked in the weapon area.</span> <span id="s609">I used to put in the bullets in the bands.</span> <span id="s610">They brought a lot of Russian bullets, and they were rusty.</span> <span id="s611">And...and they were low already on weapons, the Germans, because the Russian...the Russians started to push them back already.</span> <span id="s612">So we used to clean them up with sandpaper and put them in the bands.</span> <span id="s613">And there was the Ukrainian in charge.</span> <span id="s614">We were two girls there.</span> <span id="s615">And he always told me all sorts of stories.</span> <span id="s616">He's gonna do this, and he's gonna do that, and he's gonna kill this one.</span> <span id="s617">You know, I listened; but I didn't say yes or no.</span> <span id="s618">I didn't say it's right or wrong, because you have to be...you had to be very careful.</span> <span id="s619">All of a sudden, he says to me, "I see that some...it's a big commotion in the camp."</span> <span id="s620">And he says, "You have to go back to the barrack back."</span> <span id="s621">He closes up the weapon area, and we ran back to the barrack.</span> <span id="s622">Everything was very close.</span> <span id="s623">And we see like 12 or 14 people are walking on their knees from outside the camp into the camp.</span> <span id="s624">And Frenzel and all of them they are behind them with the [pages (ph)], and they beat them and everything.</span> <span id="s625">And they walked so until after camp where they used to sort...behind that barrack.</span> <span id="s626">And then them came in to us, and "Roll call!</span> <span id="s627">Right away!"</span> <span id="s628">We all assembled and they said, "Aufmarsch stehen!"</span> <span id="s629">So we figured this is it.</span> <span id="s630">They're gonna take us to Camp [NB: probably she is referring here to Camp 3].</span> <span id="s631">So we said to ourself...I mean, it happen all in split second.</span> <span id="s632">You really didn't have time to communicate even, you know.</span> <span id="s633">Because when the bugle sounded, you had to be right away there, even before he started blowing.</span> <span id="s634">So...and next to me and my girlfriend as we walked was Unterscharf眉hrer Wolf [NB: Franz Wolf], also miserable.</span> <span id="s635">I was at his trial too.</span> <span id="s636">And he said, "Okay, now you're gonna see something special.</span> <span id="s637">Nobody from you are gonna survive."</span> <span id="s638">So we walked and as we came to that open field behind the Sortieren [Translation: "Sorting House" (German)], they assembled us like in a half moon.</span> <span id="s639">You know?</span> <span id="s640">And Frenzel held a long speech that...that what gonna happen if somebody escapes from Sobib贸r, and we shouldn't even think about it, and then he made the others pick out 12 more.</span> <span id="s641">"Otherwise," he said, "I'm gonna take 50."</span> <span id="s642">And those...uh...those people didn't have no choice.</span> <span id="s643">They...they was so beaten up.</span> <span id="s644">You couldn't even tell their faces anymore.</span> <span id="s645">And they picked out some more from us...blindly...they didn't look.</span> <span id="s646">They didn't wanta take the one....</span> <span id="s647">You...you know?</span> <span id="s648">And they shot all those 24.</span> <span id="s649">We had to watch; and whoever Frenzel thought maybe is not dead yet, he went and gave them another bullet, you know.</span> <span id="s650">But they shot them all in their faces, not in their backs.</span> <span id="s651">And then they told us we should go back to the camp.</span> <span id="s652">It was a terrible experience.</span> <span id="s653">You...your revenge broods up even more, like once...two....</span> <span id="s654">But it goes to show that people there, if they have the slightest chance they wanted to get out and maybe tell the world what happened.</span> <span id="s655">You know?</span> <span id="s656">Because we knew if we won't do it, the world will never know.</span> <span id="s657">How would anybody know?</span> <span id="s658">The dead people won't tell.</span> <span id="s659">Like once two people made a tunnel underneath the barrack.</span> <span id="s660">At that time the fence outside the field wasn't mined.</span> <span id="s661">Later, they put in mines.</span> <span id="s662">And they escaped.</span> <span id="s663">They took us every...every 10th from us, and shot them in from of us.</span> <span id="s664">Every 10th.</span> <span id="s665">You know when you stand next to your friend and they take you and he look...that look in his face, it'll never leave me.</span> <span id="s666">This is not all.</span> <span id="s667">This is not all.</span> <span id="s668">There were so many incidents every day.</span> <span id="s669">Every day.</span> <span id="s670">Like they went once to take apart a bakery in W_odawa, and they wanted to bring it here and build it here, which they did.</span> <span id="s671">I don't know somebody said something.</span> <span id="s672">They took two people, shot them in front of us.</span> <span id="s673">Then the beatings every day, the 25 lashes on the bare flesh.</span> <span id="s674">Until they didn't see blood, they didn't give up.</span> <span id="s675">I mean, when I think back, I don't know how anybody survived.</span> <span id="s676">Including myself.</span> <span id="s677">Just to watch...to be able to control yourself, not to get at him and choke him or kill him or whatever.</span> <span id="s678">You know?</span> <span id="s679">You couldn't be sick there.</span> <span id="s680">If you admitted that you're sick or you have a fever, you went.</span> <span id="s681">So what we used to do, we used to cover up for them or hold them by the hands, drag them to work, hide them in the magazines where they kept until the evening and then take them back to the barracks.</span> <span id="s682">I have a friend who survived...she lives in now Australia.</span> <span id="s683">I mean, Wagner came in once.</span> <span id="s684">She used to work in the...in the laundry.</span> <span id="s685">She used to wash the laundry for them.</span> <span id="s686">She is...she is shorter than I am and slimmer than I am, a young girl.</span> <span id="s687">And she worked so hard, and then she fell asleep in the bathtub and he caught her.</span> <span id="s688">He gave her 10 lashes.</span> <span id="s689">One kidney went right away.</span> <span id="s690">She's still sick from it.</span> <span id="s691">I mean things like that really got you.</span> <span id="s692">Like one woman came and she brought a baby, and she kept it for two weeks in the camp and finally they...and they gave her a choice: "Either you give up the baby and you can remain."</span> <span id="s693">She was a good seamstress.</span> <span id="s694">Her husband was there, too.</span> <span id="s695">He was 'til the uprising.</span> <span id="s696">Which mother's gonna give up her baby?</span> <span id="s697">So they...he shot them both.</span> <span id="s698">I mean if...if you watched things like this, it's....</span> <span id="s699">When you think back...I mean, I don't sleep yet.</span> <span id="s700">It's gonna be 47 years that I escaped, and it's not one night that I go to sleep and all of Sobib贸r doesn't march before me; and then I can fall asleep.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q:Thank you.</span> <span id="s702">We're going to change tapes.</span> <span id="s703">[Let's break here.</span> <span id="s704">We need to change tapes and then we'll pick up.]</span> <span id="s705">[NB: TEXT IN PRECEDING BRACKETS NOT APPARENT ON VIDEOTAPE]</span></p> <p><span id="s706">TAPE #2</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q:Okay.</span> <span id="s708">Tell us.</span> <span id="s709">You have a transport you say.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A:We had once a transport which was probably the worst of all the transports.</span> <span id="s711">The people must have resisted on the way to Sobib贸r, so they threw in like chlorine and the body...into the box cars, and the people were dead and they swell up.</span> <span id="s712">And...and they...they were so thick, all of a sudden, and the whole transport came there, to Sobib贸r.</span> <span id="s713">(Pause) There were ...every day was something new.</span> <span id="s714">They thought...they were miserable if they didn't have blood.</span> <span id="s715">You know?</span> <span id="s716">Like...like dogs, hounds, pit bulls they call them.</span> <span id="s717">Yes?</span> <span id="s718">They...they just couldn't take it, not to have; and if one day there was no transport, let's say, for one reason or another....</span> <span id="s719">Not a day went by with out...let's say a half a day, you know....</span> <span id="s720">They took us out and in order not to let us think, you know, when we had let's say a half hour off, they would exercise with us in such manner that you could drop dead.</span> <span id="s721">And if you didn't do it, they shoot...shot you, if you didn't continue.</span> <span id="s722">I remember once the cook, he couldn't keep up.</span> <span id="s723">He was old.</span> <span id="s724">If I was 18, 19, he was 40.</span> <span id="s725">So he was old...or 38, or whatever.</span> <span id="s726">He couldn't keep up.</span> <span id="s727">So they took him out and they beat him so badly, Frenzel, that you couldn't tell his face or head.</span> <span id="s728">His nose from his eyes was just one ball of blood.</span> <span id="s729">That was their pleasure.</span> <span id="s730">And when you talk to them today, everybody followed orders and whatever they did wasn't wrong, even.</span> <span id="s731">Wasn't their fault.</span> <span id="s732">And that hurts.</span> <span id="s733">It hurts.</span> <span id="s734">When I went all those times to Germany, I was afraid.</span> <span id="s735">Every middle-aged man or older man I saw, I saw him in a Nazi uniform.</span> <span id="s736">I don't trust them, and I don't believe in them that they changed.</span> <span id="s737">I said it at the trial.</span> <span id="s738">If Frenzel would have a chance to wear a uniform, he would do it all over again; but maybe he would make sure now that we wouldn't escape to tell the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q:Tell us about the escape.</span> <span id="s740">How did you even begin to plan?</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A:We planned constantly.</span> <span id="s742">And I think that kept us going.</span> <span id="s743">If we would know this is it, why should go on?</span> <span id="s744">To see another 10,000 Jews come and be killed, another 20,000 be killed?</span> <span id="s745">That was not...that we wanted to see.</span> <span id="s746">You know.</span> <span id="s747">We had to.</span> <span id="s748">Then after awhile you become so numb that you just...you don't react, you...you know?</span> <span id="s749">And then, we felt we're next in line.</span> <span id="s750">Everybody from us had a death sentence in their pocket.</span> <span id="s751">It just was a matter of time.</span> <span id="s752">But, we never gave up that hope to...for revenge.</span> <span id="s753">And I think that kept us going.</span> <span id="s754">If we had a miserable day, when they kill...like Wagner.</span> <span id="s755">He decided to build a Strafskommando [NB: Strafkommando; "punishment brigade"].</span> <span id="s756">You know what "Strafskommando" means?</span> <span id="s757">"Strafskommando" means...uh..."Strafs" is "guilty."</span> <span id="s758">A "guilty unit" from whoever didn't walk straight or didn't look him right, maybe, in the eye, he put them to...to a special unit.</span> <span id="s759">And they had to work everything while running, not walk.</span> <span id="s760">That was the "Strafs."</span> <span id="s761">How long can you run?</span> <span id="s762">And they get...and their ration was cut in half.</span> <span id="s763">So we didn't get enough to begin with.</span> <span id="s764">You barely could survive; but if this was cut in half....</span> <span id="s765">And...and every day somebody else was shot, and was shot.</span> <span id="s766">And, you know, it was so terrible.</span> <span id="s767">And every evening they gave us an explanation.</span> <span id="s768">He didn't run fast enough, so they had to shoot.</span> <span id="s769">And you know what builds up in you when you listen to those words.</span> <span id="s770">It's just...I don't know where we got the strength not to react right away, you know.</span> <span id="s771">But we...we knew if we wanna plan an escape and if we wanna do it, we have to keep cool...keep our cool.</span> <span id="s772">We constantly...we planned maybe this way, maybe only part of us, and maybe....</span> <span id="s773">And then after it happened with the Waldhofskommando [NB: Waldkommando], where they killed 24 instead of 12, and when they two more of us escaped and they took every 10th one, we felt it's not right that one should escape and leave all the others to the mercy of them.</span> <span id="s774">If there's gonna be an escape, everybody has to be given the chance.</span> <span id="s775">Not everybody will know until the last day, because you had to be very careful.</span> <span id="s776">You ...you understand?</span> <span id="s777">So when Leon started planning this way and that way and that way and this way....</span> <span id="s778">And we didn't know what's going on outside the world.</span> <span id="s779">We didn't know how far the war is and where the Russians are; because there was another thing if you get out, which we didn't think we will.</span> <span id="s780">But we felt if they'll waste some bullets and kill us in the back, it would also be a revenge not to go to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s781">So then one day we saw marching in a Russian unit of POWs.</span> <span id="s782">They took them out to work.</span> <span id="s783">In the meanwhile they expanded the camp.</span> <span id="s784">They...they made Camp 4, where they used to store ammunition because they started to prepare for the Bug...for the River Bug...for the offensive in the spring, you know?</span> <span id="s785">And we saw...and those Russians came in, and we figured, "Why did they bring Russians here?"</span> <span id="s786">You know?</span> <span id="s787">In the evening you started talking and one said...turned out that they're all Jews.</span> <span id="s788">They are POWs, but they're Jews.</span> <span id="s789">And after a couple of days, Leon started to approach them, and talk to them; and we told them everything what's going on here.</span> <span id="s790">They didn't know either.</span> <span id="s791">They didn't know.</span> <span id="s792">And they had the military know-how which we didn't have, you know; and they came in from the outside, and told us what's going on on the outside.</span> <span id="s793">We needed that encouragement, you know.</span> <span id="s794">It did us a lot of good to have somebody with military know-how, with...supporting our ideas.</span> <span id="s795">And we started organizing, and after they came in and the plan was worked out that everybody at his place at work--usually wherever we worked, there was an SS man watching and a few Ukrainians--everybody at his place of work has to kill his SS and his Ukrainian at the same time, the same minute also.</span> <span id="s796">So we organized and we prepared knives, you know.</span> <span id="s797">And....</span> <span id="s798">Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q:How?</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A:In the...in the shops where they used to make the...you know, Schlosserei [Translation: "workshop" (German)]....</span> <span id="s801">I'll come to it.</span> <span id="s802">They...they used to make...they made the knives and they gave everybody.</span> <span id="s803">Then everybody had to have pockets full of sand.</span> <span id="s804">We realized if you throw sand in somebody's eyes, he grabs his eyes.</span> <span id="s805">When he grabs his eyes, you can stick a knife in him.</span> <span id="s806">Very simple.</span> <span id="s807">We didn't have no weapons.</span> <span id="s808">And we figured we have to make the es...plan the escape for a time when Wagner is not in the camp.</span> <span id="s809">We knew their schedule with vacations.</span> <span id="s810">We knew that they're six weeks there or four weeks and then they go away.</span> <span id="s811">And if those went away, the next...these go away.</span> <span id="s812">And we figured because Wagner was very smart.</span> <span id="s813">Not smart.</span> <span id="s814">He could tell what you think, not what you do.</span> <span id="s815">That's how devoted Nazi.</span> <span id="s816">Very devoted Nazi!</span> <span id="s817">And that was 26 days, after the Russian unit came.</span> <span id="s818">And we decided for October the 13th to make the escape.</span> <span id="s819">Only a small group knew of it.</span> <span id="s820">I knew every day what's going on, what has decided, how it's gonna be, what we're gonna do.</span> <span id="s821">The plan was that everybody kills his Nazi at his place of work and puts him away where nobody can see him.</span> <span id="s822">And if we have all of them dead...then we'll assemble like roll call, assemble, and we'll walk to the weapon area.</span> <span id="s823">We'll take out some weapons, and we'll walk out through the main gate; because there was no mines at the main gate.</span> <span id="s824">And we'll go into the woods.</span> <span id="s825">It was in the woods they came.</span> <span id="s826">That was our luck.</span> <span id="s827">And we'll form a partisan group.</span> <span id="s828">So and...we had to cut the electricity...the electric wires, the telephone wires....</span> <span id="s829">You know, all that.</span> <span id="s830">And on the night of the 12th, you know, everybody got ready; but nobody knew.</span> <span id="s831">Maybe 20 people.</span> <span id="s832">I was one of them.</span> <span id="s833">Because we had...some people as it turned out later got so panicky, you know; just the thought of the revenge was so great and...and some people didn't want to go.</span> <span id="s834">They gave up.</span> <span id="s835">So, maybe 20 knew; and we went...and we decided, next day 4 o'clock.</span> <span id="s836">I mean we didn't have to pack our luggage to go.</span> <span id="s837">You...you understand?</span> <span id="s838">Next day, we were all ready; and then a few trucks of SS people came into the camp.</span> <span id="s839">They never came.</span> <span id="s840">This time, they came.</span> <span id="s841">And you know, we were shivering.</span> <span id="s842">We thought maybe something leaked out.</span> <span id="s843">And they went into the casino.</span> <span id="s844">That was their... uh...dining room.</span> <span id="s845">They called it "casino."</span> <span id="s846">And they had a good meal there.</span> <span id="s847">And we had to postpone.</span> <span id="s848">Right away.</span> <span id="s849">Postpone.</span> <span id="s850">'Til tomorrow.</span> <span id="s851">And after a few hours, they left.</span> <span id="s852">They just passed by.</span> <span id="s853">They were hungry.</span> <span id="s854">There was a lot of good things here, and to drink.</span> <span id="s855">The next day was the last day because the following day Wagner was supposed to come back from [Fohler (ph)].</span> <span id="s856">So the next day we said, "This is it."</span> <span id="s857">And the next day, 4 o'clock, it started.</span> <span id="s858">And we used to give...we gave signals that four are killed, five are killed.</span> <span id="s859">Somebody would climb up the roof...six are killed, you know.</span> <span id="s860">I worked in the garden at that time.</span> <span id="s861">And they gave me those signals, and I figured I'll better go to Compound 1 to be closer to the.</span> <span id="s862">.</span> <span id="s863">uh...to the fence.</span> <span id="s864">And I came in and I stood in the laundry room with my girlfriend, [NB: she is referring to either Hella Felenbaum or Zelda Metz].</span> <span id="s865">And then I saw one walked into a barrack.</span> <span id="s866">Two boys made commotion, and he walked in and they killed him there.</span> <span id="s867">They made a commotion on purpose, and then he went into the shoemakers and they killed him.</span> <span id="s868">He went into the tailors, and they killed him.</span> <span id="s869">I cannot explain...all my fear was gone.</span> <span id="s870">Just the joy.</span> <span id="s871">We killed a Nazi!</span> <span id="s872">The revenge for all those who are burning over there...that their death is not in vain.</span> <span id="s873">And by 4 o'clock, they blew the horn; and we assembled all and as we assembled, they told us that they can't find Frenzel and Bauer [NB: Oberscharf眉hrer Erich Bauer].</span> <span id="s874">Bauer wasn't in camp.</span> <span id="s875">He was outside patrolling something with the truck.</span> <span id="s876">And we were afraid that being the wires were cut, that he got out of the camp and ran for help.</span> <span id="s877">So they decided even before, that if it won't work out for any reason, everybody on his own.</span> <span id="s878">At least, let somebody....</span> <span id="s879">And then some women started...when we told them the last minute, they became very hysterical, you know?</span> <span id="s880">They couldn't imagine what we gonna...and started crying, "What am I gonna do, and where I'm gonna go?"</span> <span id="s881">You... you understand?</span> <span id="s882">And as they...Leon jumped up at the table with Sasha, and they said that everybody on his own....</span> <span id="s883">And Leon told us, "If one survive, tell the world what happens here."</span> <span id="s884">And he said, "Everybody on his own."</span> <span id="s885">I noticed that somebody put a stepladder next to the fence behind the carpenter's shop.</span> <span id="s886">And I said to my friend, "Let's go there.</span> <span id="s887">I'm not going through the main gate.</span> <span id="s888">I don't want to be a hero.</span> <span id="s889">I want to get out."</span> <span id="s890">And as we ran to...I mean this is all a matter of seconds, split seconds.</span> <span id="s891">As I run...ran to the...uh...fence and I went up the step ladder, I saw a lot of dead bodies already on the mine fields.</span> <span id="s892">And I jumped down, and then I got a bullet in my head.</span> <span id="s893">Yeah!</span> <span id="s894">Here.</span> <span id="s895">And I felt the blood flowing warm, but I was so much aware that I started hopping on the bodies, you know, not to step on the mines.</span> <span id="s896">It was split second.</span> <span id="s897">And I ran and as I reached the woods, I figured I made it.</span> <span id="s898">And I looked back and I said, "My God, I made it for all those."</span> <span id="s899">And I promised myself whatever I can do to...to make the world know what happened, I'm gonna do.</span> <span id="s900">So...then I came to the woods, and a lot of them came into the woods and it started to getting dark already.</span> <span id="s901">Was October.</span> <span id="s902">And Leon and Sasha told us to break up in small groups.</span> <span id="s903">He said, "If they catch one group, maybe the other one will make it.</span> <span id="s904">If we'll stick together, they'll get us all."</span> <span id="s905">Because we didn't know where Frenzel was.</span> <span id="s906">So somehow I..</span> <span id="s907">.</span> <span id="s908">I teamed up with a group--nine men, myself and a woman from Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s909">We started walking and walking.</span> <span id="s910">I walked three nights, and I came back to Sobib贸r on the third night.</span> <span id="s911">In circles.</span> <span id="s912">And as we saw the camp, we ran again.</span> <span id="s913">And the night before the escape...in Sobib贸r, you didn't cry.</span> <span id="s914">You never cried.</span> <span id="s915">You so...it was so numb...it's...it's very hard to explain.</span> <span id="s916">You know?</span> <span id="s917">You never cried.</span> <span id="s918">But that night before the escape, we all cried and we said goodbye.</span> <span id="s919">I mean, nobody in his right mind thought even that we're gonna get out.</span> <span id="s920">Versh...?</span> <span id="s921">You...you understand?</span> <span id="s922">So we cried and cried and said goodbye and I fell asleep.</span> <span id="s923">We...I went to sleep with my boots and with my...I had two skirts and three sweaters and you know, and a babushka and a coat.</span> <span id="s924">And I went to sleep with everything.</span> <span id="s925">Because we figured in case something leaks out and they'll find out during the night, that I..</span> <span id="s926">.</span> <span id="s927">we should be ready to run because there's nothing to lose anyway.</span> <span id="s928">Might as well!</span> <span id="s929">And as I cried and I fell asleep, I had a dream.</span> <span id="s930">And my mother came into the camp through the main gate and I said, "Mom, you know what we're gonna do."</span> <span id="s931">She said, "Yes, and I came because of that."</span> <span id="s932">And she...she took me by the hand and she led me out to the main gate into a barn, and said, "Here, you'll go and you'll survive."</span> <span id="s933">That was the end of the dream.</span> <span id="s934">In the morning I told my next neighbor, slept a girl, and I said I had a funny dream.</span> <span id="s935">She said, "Naw, you know you were thinking about it."</span> <span id="s936">And I said, "You know what.</span> <span id="s937">If I'll get out, I have to go to that barn and see what happens."</span> <span id="s938">So after three days after we reached Sobib贸r again, we started walking again.</span> <span id="s939">And meanwhile my wound started hurting and it got all pussy [NB: covered with pus], and I got fever.</span> <span id="s940">All I had is a few lumps of sugar in my pocket and a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s941">No water.</span> <span id="s942">The worst thing was the water.</span> <span id="s943">You know?</span> <span id="s944">And by Saturday night, we fell asleep in a field with...not barley, something like it.</span> <span id="s945">Yeah.</span> <span id="s946">While I jumped down the fence and I got shot, that coat was so heavy it was hard for me to run; so I threw away the coat.</span> <span id="s947">That was my biggest mistake.</span> <span id="s948">But I didn't catch a cold.</span> <span id="s949">Don't worry.</span> <span id="s950">And we laid in that field.</span> <span id="s951">In the morning...a whole night it rained very fine.</span> <span id="s952">In the morning it started freezing.</span> <span id="s953">You know, in Poland.</span> <span id="s954">And I got up stiff.</span> <span id="s955">I mean I couldn't stand up.</span> <span id="s956">And I said to all of them, "Listen, there from far away I see a lonely little house.</span> <span id="s957">I'm going into that house.</span> <span id="s958">I cannot take it.</span> <span id="s959">I have my satisfaction.</span> <span id="s960">We killed the Germans.</span> <span id="s961">I escaped from Sobib贸r.</span> <span id="s962">But now, really, I cannot take it."</span> <span id="s963">So they said, "You know what?</span> <span id="s964">You go in and see if you can get some bread and something to eat, and we'll wait."</span> <span id="s965">I said, "Okay."</span> <span id="s966">As I started walking, one of the guys said, "I'll go with you."</span> <span id="s967">I said, "Okay."</span> <span id="s968">He came with me.</span> <span id="s969">I knocked on the door.</span> <span id="s970">There was an old man.</span> <span id="s971">An old man!</span> <span id="s972">He probably wasn't old.</span> <span id="s973">No teeth.</span> <span id="s974">He had a 20 year old son.</span> <span id="s975">How old could he be?</span> <span id="s976">But you know in Poland....</span> <span id="s977">One room, the cow was in the room and the bed was in the room.</span> <span id="s978">Everything was in the room.</span> <span id="s979">As we opened the door, he told me, "You must be from Sobib贸r."</span> <span id="s980">I said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s981">He said, "You did the best thing that could help...happen to those Nazis."</span> <span id="s982">He said, "What can I do for you?"</span> <span id="s983">I said, "We need some food, and I need to wash my wound."</span> <span id="s984">I showed him what I have.</span> <span id="s985">He said, "Listen, you come into my barn.</span> <span id="s986">I have to go to church with my son.</span> <span id="s987">If I won't come to church they'll get suspicious.</span> <span id="s988">And when we'll come from church, I'll feed you."</span> <span id="s989">So he took us into the barn and I said... Yeah, in the meanwhile, a third one came in.</span> <span id="s990">He said, "You told me two."</span> <span id="s991">I said, "This is it.</span> <span id="s992">Only three."</span> <span id="s993">[NB: the two others with her were Samuel Lerer and Avram Kohn].</span> <span id="s994">The others saw that we are not returning, so they run away.</span> <span id="s995">None of them survived.</span> <span id="s996">So he took us into the barn.</span> <span id="s997">We went up on the loft, you know, in the straw, and everything felt so good and warm.</span> <span id="s998">And I said that whatever'll happen...he'll probably go for the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s999">But he didn't go.</span> <span id="s1000">He went, and after a few hours he came back from church and his son brought us in bread and soup and hot milk and cheese; and I said to the guys, "That's our last meal, our last supper, probably."</span> <span id="s1001">And we ate, and he told us that soon it will get dark.</span> <span id="s1002">He'll take us into the house so we can clean up a little bit.</span> <span id="s1003">When it got dark he took us into the house.</span> <span id="s1004">He had a big pot of water boiling.</span> <span id="s1005">He told me to wash off my head.</span> <span id="s1006">He put some...his remedy, unsalted lard.</span> <span id="s1007">But it healed.</span> <span id="s1008">It healed.</span> <span id="s1009">Took care of the infection.</span> <span id="s1010">And we sat and we told him the story about Sobib贸r.</span> <span id="s1011">He was very interested.</span> <span id="s1012">And then he said, "What you want to do now?"</span> <span id="s1013">I said, "I have to go someplace; and if I won't find a refuge there, I'll come back and maybe you'll be able to help us."</span> <span id="s1014">He said, "Okay."</span> <span id="s1015">He give us some milk and some bread and some cheese and some onions.</span> <span id="s1016">You know, whatever he had.</span> <span id="s1017">And we had some money.</span> <span id="s1018">I wanted to give him some money.</span> <span id="s1019">I had money from home, too; and I..</span> <span id="s1020">.</span> <span id="s1021">we hid it, and in the last day we took it with us.</span> <span id="s1022">He said, "You know what?</span> <span id="s1023">Keep the money.</span> <span id="s1024">Maybe there's somebody who won't give you without money."</span> <span id="s1025">And the young man waited with us until twelve, one o'clock, when it's got very quiet all around.</span> <span id="s1026">And he walked us to the woods and he showed us where it is.</span> <span id="s1027">And I asked him his name and the name of the village.</span> <span id="s1028">He didn't want to tell me.</span> <span id="s1029">He was afraid in case they catch us and they'll torture us.</span> <span id="s1030">You know?</span> <span id="s1031">And I didn't wanna tell him where I'm going, too.</span> <span id="s1032">So, anyway he took us; and from there to the place that I knew, that barn, was probably about 15 kilometers, maybe 18, which I could make in one day easily.</span> <span id="s1033">It took us two weeks to get there because we walked only at night and in circles.</span> <span id="s1034">You know?</span> <span id="s1035">Because we were afraid in the daytime.</span> <span id="s1036">You see in the daytime we were in the woods because the Germans never went into the woods.</span> <span id="s1037">They were outside shooting in, but never went into the woods.</span> <span id="s1038">And after two weeks in the night I got a village I recognized.</span> <span id="s1039">We...we stood...we laid three days and three nights just near the main highway to be able to cross because the Germans had so much traffic...military traffic, and we had to wait for the moment just to cross.</span> <span id="s1040">So I recognize the...the barn, and I said, "This is the place."</span> <span id="s1041">And I knew this was one of my father's customers...the gentile that I told you helped us so much [NB: Stefan Marcyniuk].</span> <span id="s1042">Matter of fact, when I was in Staw-Nowosiolki, he used to deliver bread for the Germans for us.</span> <span id="s1043">And I saw his man who used to bring the bread and I said, "Tell Marcyniuk that we are hungry."</span> <span id="s1044">He used to send us every day two-kilo loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s1045">The.</span> <span id="s1046">.</span> <span id="s1047">the guy left it underneath the fence.</span> <span id="s1048">You know what it meant in a concentration camp...2 kilo bread?</span> <span id="s1049">It was a fortune!</span> <span id="s1050">So I recognized and I said, "This is the barn;" because we used to go as young kids.</span> <span id="s1051">He had a big farm.</span> <span id="s1052">We picked cherries, you know, like children.</span> <span id="s1053">Was not far from Che_m, about 10 kilometers.</span> <span id="s1054">And on the other side of the road, his mother used to live.</span> <span id="s1055">So I said, "I'm gonna knock on the other side."</span> <span id="s1056">And I knocked, and a man came out and he thought we are partisans; and, "Don't shoot!"</span> <span id="s1057">and, "Don't this."</span> <span id="s1058">I said, "I'm not gonna shoot you.</span> <span id="s1059">I'm not after you.</span> <span id="s1060">I'm after that man.</span> <span id="s1061">I need to settle something with him."</span> <span id="s1062">I didn't want to say.</span> <span id="s1063">So he said, "You know, he doesn't live here."</span> <span id="s1064">I knew he doesn't live there because he lived in the city.</span> <span id="s1065">"But he comes once in awhile here, every week, every two weeks," and so forth and so on.</span> <span id="s1066">And I said, "We have something to settle with him.</span> <span id="s1067">Don't worry."</span> <span id="s1068">He gave us some bread, just to get rid of us, and some onions...whatever they had.</span> <span id="s1069">And we waited.</span> <span id="s1070">I went away.</span> <span id="s1071">We waited.</span> <span id="s1072">When it got real quiet and all the lights were out in the village, we went into that barn.</span> <span id="s1073">And as I went into that barn, I mean as dark as it was, I said, "That's the barn my mother showed me in the dream."</span> <span id="s1074">In the meanwhile, when we went into the barn a partisan group came into the yard; and those two guys [NB: Samuel and Avram] said, "Let's go with the partisans."</span> <span id="s1075">I said, "If you want to go, you're welcome.</span> <span id="s1076">I'm staying."</span> <span id="s1077">We also met a partisan group before; and they wanted to join, because it was the only way to survive the German party.</span> <span id="s1078">I said, "If you want to go to the partisan, please.</span> <span id="s1079">I'm not going.</span> <span id="s1080">I'm going to find out what's there."</span> <span id="s1081">And we climbed up the loft, with straw again.</span> <span id="s1082">We were at home already.</span> <span id="s1083">We stayed there about 3 days.</span> <span id="s1084">Nobody showed up.</span> <span id="s1085">So we got hungry.</span> <span id="s1086">So I said, "In the evening, we'll go to the neighboring village, and we'll buy something."</span> <span id="s1087">We went away, and we met...we went into a farmer.</span> <span id="s1088">He gave us, he gave us a bottle of milk.</span> <span id="s1089">He gave us some bread, whatever.</span> <span id="s1090">And we walked back.</span> <span id="s1091">We walked back.</span> <span id="s1092">We climbed up the loft, which straw was very solid, and one guy lost a bottle of milk.</span> <span id="s1093">It wasn't the bottle of milk.</span> <span id="s1094">It was just not to leave any traces that people are here.</span> <span id="s1095">And he...I said, "You better go down and in the dark try to find it."</span> <span id="s1096">And as he went down and he looked, and I told him in Jewish, "Did you find it?"</span> <span id="s1097">And as I said, "Did you find it," something jumped up from that loft like a white ghost, white linen pants.</span> <span id="s1098">And we got so scared.</span> <span id="s1099">And he said, "Who is it?"</span> <span id="s1100">I said, "Idel."</span> <span id="s1101">That was my brother's name.</span> <span id="s1102">And he said, "You're dead."</span> <span id="s1103">And that was my brother in the loft, being there already 10 months.</span> <span id="s1104">And he said, "I'm gonna hold your hand until it get light because I know you're dead."</span> <span id="s1105">And when it started daylight, he saw me and I told him where I was and I told him that I'm here.</span> <span id="s1106">He saw the man.</span> <span id="s1107">He said, "Listen, he's gonna come any day here.</span> <span id="s1108">I'm gonna tell him only about you and one man."</span> <span id="s1109">And the third man, if he'll take you in, we're gonna keep the other one.</span> <span id="s1110">We're gonna share whatever food he'll give us."</span> <span id="s1111">He came after a few days; and they...he used to whistle, and my brother knew that the coast is clear and he can go out, because underneath the loft he built him a bunker underneath the ground.</span> <span id="s1112">My brother jumped out and he told him.</span> <span id="s1113">And he said to my brother he should call me out, and I came out and he just went like this.</span> <span id="s1114">He said, "If God put you together, I'm not going to divide you.</span> <span id="s1115">Whatever will happen will happen to all of us."</span> <span id="s1116">And I was there 'til the liberation.</span> <span id="s1117">He never found out that the third man was with us until liberation.</span> <span id="s1118">We shared the food and we kept him hidden.</span> <span id="s1119">Some story!</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">Q:Tell me about liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">A:A few days before the liberation...I mean, it was such a fancy farm and it had a wooden fence around; he was a very wealthy man in our city.</span> <span id="s1122">And over there, only his old mother lived.</span> <span id="s1123">He used to take care of the farm, but he didn't live there.</span> <span id="s1124">And the mother was senile, already.</span> <span id="s1125">And that was our luck.</span> <span id="s1126">Even if she would see us...once she saw me.</span> <span id="s1127">I walked down in the barn, you know, to stretch out my legs and she asked me, "Why...why you walking here?</span> <span id="s1128">There's a war in the city?"</span> <span id="s1129">I said, "No.</span> <span id="s1130">I just came to visit.</span> <span id="s1131">I'm going back."</span> <span id="s1132">And a few days before...you know, we were already exhausted.</span> <span id="s1133">My brother was there 19 months, and I was already 9 months, without a table, a spoon of warm water all those 9 months, without cooked food because he didn't live there.</span> <span id="s1134">He couldn't cook for us.</span> <span id="s1135">Only he gave us enough bread.</span> <span id="s1136">And water.</span> <span id="s1137">Sometimes a little jam, a little margarine, you know, or something like this.</span> <span id="s1138">He gave us plenty of onions and plenty of garlic.</span> <span id="s1139">And I think that helped us, too.</span> <span id="s1140">And it was already the last days and all of a sudden we...and he told us that he built a bunker.</span> <span id="s1141">He owned a piece of woods past the farms, a little further down.</span> <span id="s1142">He said, "If you have a chance, run out from the barn and go to the woods, because the Germans are retreating and they're burning everything to ground, livestock and everything."</span> <span id="s1143">So we said, "Okay."</span> <span id="s1144">And as we got ready... ready...whatever we have to.</span> <span id="s1145">.</span> <span id="s1146">you know...all of a sudden... yeah...before, the Germans came and set up shop in our yard.</span> <span id="s1147">And we are sitting and looking at them, you know, through the boards.</span> <span id="s1148">And two officers started cleaning their weapons and one shot the other.</span> <span id="s1149">I didn't know if it's on...on purpose or accident.</span> <span id="s1150">And they set up a court in the yard.</span> <span id="s1151">And I said, "That's what we need.</span> <span id="s1152">Exactly.</span> <span id="s1153">The last day."</span> <span id="s1154">And in the meanwhile came an order that they have to leave.</span> <span id="s1155">And they left.</span> <span id="s1156">So we survived this.</span> <span id="s1157">The next day, all of a sudden, we figured soon it'll get dark...we'll go out in the fields because the corn and everything was very high already.... (Sigh) They bring into our yard maybe 150 Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s1158">Those were the people that they took with them to...to dig ditches, and to do their....</span> <span id="s1159">And those people was so worn out, you...you know.</span> <span id="s1160">And they saw such barn with so much straw and everybody start pulling the straw, you know, and to make himself comfortable inside and outside.</span> <span id="s1161">And we feeled that they're getting to us.</span> <span id="s1162">And one guy was up there pulling the straw and handing it to the others.</span> <span id="s1163">So we had on top underneath the roof, on the loft, we had a hole where we used to crawl in.</span> <span id="s1164">The...the straw was solid...set up, and then we had a bunker underneath the ground.</span> <span id="s1165">And there was like a stopper made out of straw that when we crawled in...because we had to go to the bathroom.</span> <span id="s1166">We used to go once at night out in the fields.</span> <span id="s1167">You know?</span> <span id="s1168">And we used to go...he used to put water from the...uh... well.</span> <span id="s1169">He had like a trough, where he used to...the horses used to drink, and the cows.</span> <span id="s1170">So he filled it up every time with water; so at night we went out and got some water for us to drink.</span> <span id="s1171">We drink one day...one time a day.</span> <span id="s1172">That's it.</span> <span id="s1173">So all the...so my brother noticed that he starts pulling that stopper.</span> <span id="s1174">So he pushed it up and he said, "What do you want?"</span> <span id="s1175">He said, "Don't worry.</span> <span id="s1176">Don't worry.</span> <span id="s1177">I won't do nothing to you."</span> <span id="s1178">So my brother said, "Would you like a loaf of bread?"</span> <span id="s1179">He said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s1180">So we gave him the loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s1181">And he said, "Don't worry.</span> <span id="s1182">Pull in the stopper.</span> <span id="s1183">I'll be here until we leave."</span> <span id="s1184">So we pulled in the stopper; but we figured here's the end, you know?</span> <span id="s1185">And he laid down there, took off his shoes; and then the others came into the barn and he gave everybody a piece of bread and they said, "Let's take everything a part.</span> <span id="s1186">Maybe there's a lot of bread here."</span> <span id="s1187">He said, "No.</span> <span id="s1188">You see, I went through everything.</span> <span id="s1189">Maybe the owner slept here and he left one loaf of bread."</span> <span id="s1190">And we were sitting down.</span> <span id="s1191">We could see through... through the boards...from the barn what's going on.</span> <span id="s1192">And all of a sudden, a few hours, there comes an order they have to leave.</span> <span id="s1193">They have to leave and they have to assemble.</span> <span id="s1194">They all went into the yard to assemble.</span> <span id="s1195">He pulls out the stopper, that guy.</span> <span id="s1196">He said, "We are leaving.</span> <span id="s1197">Don't worry.</span> <span id="s1198">I'll leave the last so nobody should bother you."</span> <span id="s1199">And we pulled in and my brother said, "Would you like another?"</span> <span id="s1200">We always kept a few loaves of bread in case we have to run.</span> <span id="s1201">So my brother said, "Would you like another."</span> <span id="s1202">"No," he said, "If I'll take another loaf of bread, they'll be suspicious."</span> <span id="s1203">And we saw that they assembled and they calling him and he said, "My feet are so swollen, can't my...can't get my shoes on."</span> <span id="s1204">And then when they all were assembled, he climbed down from the loft and he turned towards us and he went like this and they left.</span> <span id="s1205">So we survived again.</span> <span id="s1206">Yeah?</span> <span id="s1207">So next day...this was at night.</span> <span id="s1208">Next morning, my brother woke up and he said, "Listen, now they left.</span> <span id="s1209">We're gonna leave to.</span> <span id="s1210">We're not staying here anymore."</span> <span id="s1211">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1212">And during the night another unit of Germans came in.</span> <span id="s1213">I don't know if SS or military.</span> <span id="s1214">They came in and they left also after a few hours.</span> <span id="s1215">My brother said, "They left.</span> <span id="s1216">Let's leave.</span> <span id="s1217">Whatever'll happen, will happen."</span> <span id="s1218">And early in the morning, we saw it's quiet all around...was still not daylight.</span> <span id="s1219">We just crawled down from the loft, down to the barn, and there were three loaves of bread and three cans with onions the Germans left and three rifles.</span> <span id="s1220">We didn't know what to do with the rifles.</span> <span id="s1221">And we (chuckle)...we took it and we crawled in, because behind the barn the field started.</span> <span id="s1222">And we lay down.</span> <span id="s1223">And he told us before, "The first chance you have, get us something so...in case something, people shouldn't recognize."</span> <span id="s1224">We crawled in and we exposed ourselves...the faces to the sun.</span> <span id="s1225">And all of a sudden, the Germans...this... this village is up on a hill...very high up and...and down below it is the main highway.</span> <span id="s1226">On the other side were the Russians and up on the Hill were the Germans.</span> <span id="s1227">And they started shooting.</span> <span id="s1228">Zoooo...Zoooo...Zoooo....</span> <span id="s1229">And we figured, "Here we went through all that, and now we're gonna get it!"</span> <span id="s1230">Doesn't matter from whom, from the Russians or the Germans.</span> <span id="s1231">And we laid up, and then it quiet down.</span> <span id="s1232">And when it started getting dark, my brother said, "Let's crawl into the barn and from there, maybe we'll get into the woods."</span> <span id="s1233">As we crawled into the barn, he was looking for us.</span> <span id="s1234">The Russians were already there.</span> <span id="s1235">Because the Russians went from the Bug.</span> <span id="s1236">They didn't go straight with the highway.</span> <span id="s1237">They surrounded the Germans and they took them in.</span> <span id="s1238">And that was when we were free.</span> <span id="s1239">Not exactly free, because it started the Polish people were miserable.</span> <span id="s1240">Very bad.</span> <span id="s1241">Very bad.</span> <span id="s1242">A lot of our friends who survived got killed by them.</span> <span id="s1243">The...the national army just killed.</span> <span id="s1244">And then they killed Leon, in December.</span> <span id="s1245">And that was a big shock for us; because we just stuck to him and we looked up to him like a father figure, like somebody who helped us survive, who took all the responsibility for us.</span> <span id="s1246">You...you understand?</span> <span id="s1247">And there he was gone.</span> <span id="s1248">And we decided at that time not to remain in Poland.</span> <span id="s1249">We just followed the Russian army wherever they went, and we...until we got to Berlin.</span> <span id="s1250">And it was funny that there we felt safe after all those years.</span> <span id="s1251">It wasn't easy to be there.</span> <span id="s1252">It wasn't easy at all, because everyone you saw, you saw them as a Nazi with a uniform.</span> <span id="s1253">But we felt safe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">Q:Tell us about what you did next.</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">A:What I did next?</span> <span id="s1256">We settled in Berlin, where I got married.</span> <span id="s1257">And we started a business.</span> <span id="s1258">I started it.</span> <span id="s1259">But we didn't want to remain there.</span> <span id="s1260">We just waited for the first chance to get out, and we got out.</span> <span id="s1261">And we came to this country and we started on the bottom and we made it.</span> <span id="s1262">And we are very grateful.</span> <span id="s1263">And I have two wonderful sons, very well educated.</span> <span id="s1264">And I think when we came here, we didn't want pity, you know, from nobody.</span> <span id="s1265">We just wanted to prove to ourselves that they didn't defeat us.</span> <span id="s1266">They didn't kill us.</span> <span id="s1267">Maybe, physically, they hurted us.</span> <span id="s1268">You know?</span> <span id="s1269">And we wanted to prove to ourselves that we can do whatever anybody can do and we can be human beings again.</span> <span id="s1270">And we are very successful here.</span> <span id="s1271">And I have seven grandchildren, which is my pride and joy.</span> <span id="s1272">And that's the biggest revenge that I have on the Nazis...those children.</span> <span id="s1273">And I promised myself, wherever I'll have a chance, I have to tell the story of Sobib贸r; because after we escaped they erased every track of Sobib贸r.</span> <span id="s1274">And if I told somebody right after the war, they said, "Never heard of it.</span> <span id="s1275">Never heard of it.</span> <span id="s1276">Never heard of it."</span> <span id="s1277">And it hurted me very much, because I felt the people of Sobib贸r never gave up and they fought to the last and they didn't care if they make it or not.</span> <span id="s1278">But just for that revenge, and to bring the story to the world.</span> <span id="s1279">And I feel because we bring out the story, there are so many other stories for...from people who fought, who died just for that revenge and just for that protecting that honor of those who didn't make it.</span> <span id="s1280">You know?</span> <span id="s1281">And I feel they are not here to tell the story; but there're thousands and thousands of stories like my story.</span> <span id="s1282">But if people are not here to tell it...so I have to do as much as I can.</span> <span id="s1283">It's not easy, but I won't give up as long as I live.</span> <span id="s1284">I went to a lot of trials, and I think the Nazis at the trials, not one denied that Sobib贸r existed.</span> <span id="s1285">Not one denied what happened there.</span> <span id="s1286">Just they didn't want to take the blame.</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">Q:Who did you identify at the trials?</span> <span id="s1288">What trials were you at and who did you identify?</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">A:First, I recognized Bauer on the street in Berlin.</span> <span id="s1290">And the funniest thought was...you see, after the war, all those Nazis...uh...if there were no evidence, they were like rehabilitated.</span> <span id="s1291">It's called in German "[entnazivisieren (ph)]" [NB: "denazified"].</span> <span id="s1292">And Bauer was already [entnazivisieren (ph)].</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">Q:Tell us on tape who Bauer was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">A:Bauer was a nothing, but he was the gas master.</span> <span id="s1295">He used to open the valves and close the valves and let the gas out...and that was...that was Bauer.</span> <span id="s1296">I didn't...I personally didn't catch him.</span> <span id="s1297">It was another...the guy that survived with me together in the farm...on the farm [NB: Samuel Lerer].</span> <span id="s1298">He saw him, and he went over and he told the policeman to arrest him.</span> <span id="s1299">He was like in the Luna Park, an amusement park.</span> <span id="s1300">He was riding there, the thing.</span> <span id="s1301">And then he ran home and he said, "Listen..." I lived in Berlin.</span> <span id="s1302">At that time, I was married.</span> <span id="s1303">And he said, "I found Bauer.</span> <span id="s1304">And I told the police to check his documents, but they're gonna let him out."</span> <span id="s1305">I said, "Let's go."</span> <span id="s1306">And I went to the police station and I told them, "This is Bauer."</span> <span id="s1307">And they said, "Oh, we can't.</span> <span id="s1308">You have to have three witnesses."</span> <span id="s1309">You know, the German bureaucracy.</span> <span id="s1310">I said, "I'll give you three pounds of coffee if you keep him."</span> <span id="s1311">He kept him for the three pounds of coffee.</span> <span id="s1312">And the next day, you know, it's only three days if he doesn't admit, you have to let him go.</span> <span id="s1313">And he didn't admit nothing.</span> <span id="s1314">The third day-- the prosecutor was a German who suffered an awful lot during the war.</span> <span id="s1315">He was in the underground.</span> <span id="s1316">He was beaten.</span> <span id="s1317">He was crippled.</span> <span id="s1318">And I said, "Listen, I want you to sit and I want to ask Bauer questions."</span> <span id="s1319">And he agreed.</span> <span id="s1320">Natural, 1950 it was different like today.</span> <span id="s1321">And I went, and I started asking; and I pinned him like to the wall that he couldn't get out.</span> <span id="s1322">I said, "This and this girl worked for you.</span> <span id="s1323">You lived there and there.</span> <span id="s1324">Your room looked like this and this.</span> <span id="s1325">You wore this and this uniform, when this Hauptstrumbannfuhrer came.</span> <span id="s1326">You walked with Himmler, behind him."</span> <span id="s1327">You know.</span> <span id="s1328">And then he couldn't...he said, "Yes, I was there."</span> <span id="s1329">And then the trial started.</span> <span id="s1330">Natural, at that time there was no death sentence in...in Germany, and they...I was the only witness at the trial.</span> <span id="s1331">And I testified, and he got life sentence.</span> <span id="s1332">He was sentenced to life in prison.</span> <span id="s1333">He was in Spandau with Hess all that time.</span> <span id="s1334">And then after a few years...I was in the States, already.</span> <span id="s1335">No.</span> <span id="s1336">I was still in Berlin.</span> <span id="s1337">He gave out Kliehr, Gomerski, Frenzel, [Franz] Wolf, DuBois, Bolander...all of those who were in Sobib贸r.</span> <span id="s1338">And I went...before I left for the States, I went to Kliehr's and Gomerski's trial.</span> <span id="s1339">I was also the only witness.</span> <span id="s1340">Gomerski got life sentence.</span> <span id="s1341">Kliehr...I really couldn't tell anything bad about him.</span> <span id="s1342">You...you understand?</span> <span id="s1343">He was in charge of the shoe magazine, where they collected all the shoes from the people.</span> <span id="s1344">And I remember once I went in and I needed a pair of shoes.</span> <span id="s1345">He treated me well.</span> <span id="s1346">He gave everybody shoes, if nobody saw.</span> <span id="s1347">He was also in charge of the bakery.</span> <span id="s1348">If he could give a piece of bread unnoticed, he would give.</span> <span id="s1349">He really didn't have nothing to do with the transports.</span> <span id="s1350">I don't really know why he was there.</span> <span id="s1351">Maybe by accident.</span> <span id="s1352">And I felt, "Why put the blame on the man when he didn't do nothing?"</span> <span id="s1353">And he was acquitted.</span> <span id="s1354">And I think this hurted Gomerski even more, because they...it proved that you could be a human being there, too.</span> <span id="s1355">You know?</span> <span id="s1356">But Gomerski, Frenzel, Wagner, one of the Wolfs...there were two Wolf brothers.</span> <span id="s1357">One we killed.</span> <span id="s1358">The other...the nice one we killed, because we didn't have no choice.</span> <span id="s1359">But the other one ...you know, they did it with such a joy and with such a satisfaction and no matter how much blood they drunk, it wasn't enough for them.</span> <span id="s1360">You know?</span> <span id="s1361">So Kliehr was acquitted.</span> <span id="s1362">He died later.</span> <span id="s1363">And Frenzel got life imprisonment.</span> <span id="s1364">Then I went to the trial of the 12.</span> <span id="s1365">Frenzel got life in prison.</span> <span id="s1366">DuBois committed suicide during the trial.</span> <span id="s1367">Not Dubois, Bolander.</span> <span id="s1368">Bolander.</span> <span id="s1369">All the others got 12, and 15, and so.</span> <span id="s1370">Everybody was there, but...nobody is guilty.</span> <span id="s1371">You know?</span> <span id="s1372">And I felt I didn't have the trust in the judge, because they were older people.</span> <span id="s1373">And...and that's where I had the scene with that guy, [Wrangsher (ph)], with that lawyer of Frankel.</span> <span id="s1374">You know?</span> <span id="s1375">When I went later to the trials and there were younger lawyers and younger prosecutors, it was different.</span> <span id="s1376">Although the prosecutor at this trial, he was from the [Ottmann (ph)], I have forgotten his name.</span> <span id="s1377">I have his name home.</span> <span id="s1378">He...he really....he was a young man.</span> <span id="s1379">I trusted more the young people, the new generation than the old.</span> <span id="s1380">I had a feeling one Nazi defends the other.</span> <span id="s1381">They...they wanted to put me on trial instead of him.</span> <span id="s1382">You know?</span> <span id="s1383">It wasn't that they killed 6 million Jews, Hitler told them to do it.</span> <span id="s1384">It's not Hitler told them to do it!</span> <span id="s1385">It's not Hitler.</span> <span id="s1386">Everybody...I..</span> <span id="s1387">.</span> <span id="s1388">I told them at the trial.</span> <span id="s1389">If you take all those and put on uniforms, the next day they'll do the same thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">Q:Did you at the trial tell some of the same stories that you told me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">A:Sure.</span> <span id="s1392">Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">Q:And that was your evidence?</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">A:Now, I'll tell you, they had a lot of evidence.</span> <span id="s1395">More than I could remember.</span> <span id="s1396">More than I could remember.</span> <span id="s1397">They had a lot of evidence, because at that time there were more survivors.</span> <span id="s1398">Not all went to....</span> <span id="s1399">Very few went to the trials.</span> <span id="s1400">Very few.</span> <span id="s1401">A lot of them just couldn't take it.</span> <span id="s1402">It was.</span> <span id="s1403">.</span> <span id="s1404">it was very difficult to sit there, and feel you're sitting in front of a murderer.</span> <span id="s1405">It's not a murderer.</span> <span id="s1406">A murderer kills one person.</span> <span id="s1407">These are hundreds...millions.</span> <span id="s1408">And nobody tries even...and nobody even says, "I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s1409">It was wrong" You know, it hurted very much.</span> <span id="s1410">They tried to...to confuse you.</span> <span id="s1411">Don't forget, according to the German law, he sits there with a lawyer.</span> <span id="s1412">The lawyer tells him what to say and what not to say.</span> <span id="s1413">I'm sitting there.</span> <span id="s1414">I don't have a lawyer.</span> <span id="s1415">I'm not allowed a lawyer.</span> <span id="s1416">You had to be very strong, really, to stand up.</span> <span id="s1417">But I wasn't afraid.</span> <span id="s1418">I was hurt.</span> <span id="s1419">I was nervous.</span> <span id="s1420">But I wasn't afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">Q:Can we go back for a minute to the uprising itself?</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">Q:You've told us about it.</span> <span id="s1424">Did you take any part in the shooting, or the blowing up of the crematorium at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">A:No.</span> <span id="s1426">No.</span> <span id="s1427">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">Q:Just what you've told us?</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">A:I just was...uh...like a messenger.</span> <span id="s1430">You know?</span> <span id="s1431">They send me here.</span> <span id="s1432">They send me there.</span> <span id="s1433">But no women took part in the actually killings.</span> <span id="s1434">You know?</span> <span id="s1435">They were helping in any way...bring a message.</span> <span id="s1436">Because even in camp, the women could...uh...uh...move around easier than the men.</span> <span id="s1437">It wasn't so suspicious if the woman walked around and moved around than a man.</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">Q:What...what has been the affect of all of this on your life do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">A:The affect probably is I have all the reasons in the world to be happy.</span> <span id="s1440">I have a wonderful husband.</span> <span id="s1441">We are married 44 years, going to be in July.</span> <span id="s1442">Financially, I am very well off, considering.</span> <span id="s1443">I mean, I'm very happy.</span> <span id="s1444">You know?</span> <span id="s1445">I have a beautiful family.</span> <span id="s1446">But I cannot be happy.</span> <span id="s1447">Inside!</span> <span id="s1448">I see people like...they're buy...they're building a home.</span> <span id="s1449">They're so happy.</span> <span id="s1450">They're buying a car.</span> <span id="s1451">They're happy.</span> <span id="s1452">They're buying a dress.</span> <span id="s1453">They're happy.</span> <span id="s1454">I really cannot be happy.</span> <span id="s1455">I have those things.</span> <span id="s1456">I can have them, and I can not have them.</span> <span id="s1457">You know, it's...how should I say...I really...there are people can laugh over anything.</span> <span id="s1458">I cannot laugh.</span> <span id="s1459">I laugh, but it's squeezed out.</span> <span id="s1460">The feeling of enjoyment is taken.</span> <span id="s1461">I feel that.</span> <span id="s1462">(Long Pause)</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">Q:Is there anything you want to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">A:I just want to add (sigh)...that it can't happen again.</span> <span id="s1465">And that's why, maybe not in my time, but people...and maybe not for the Jewish people, but it can happen the Holocaust again.</span> <span id="s1466">The world is full of bad things.</span> <span id="s1467">And I think everybody should be on the look out.</span> <span
