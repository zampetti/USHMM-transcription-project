(social workers) was it that they had a prejudiced attitude towards the survivors that resulted in their not being ready to cope with the kind of problem that you presented, a person who wants to further his education and go someplace or in other words, was it because most of the people who came to them were not educated, OR was it that they didn’t think that the survivors should have higher expectations?</span> <span id="s14">What do you think was really the case here?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">SN: Well, I think first of all, it was lack of experience.</span> <span id="s16">I don’t think that the social worker was the type of person who had breadth of knowledge to response to different situations.</span> <span id="s17">There were set patters.</span> <span id="s18">Let’s not kid ourselves.</span> <span id="s19">There were many people coming through and no out of ill-will, but I would say that there were some assumptions that were made, you know, people come in who were tradesmen, a little – merchants, or whatever, that’s what the workers – that’s what they going be doing and they just – probably aren’t prepared for somebody who wasn’t a university student.</span> <span id="s20">They may have come across doctors, already people who were professionals, and then they would tell them you have to go and study and take an exam and so on.</span> <span id="s21">But somebody who was in the process, I was young.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">WH: . . . when were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">SN: I was born in 1929 . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s24">WH: What year were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">SIDI: ’29.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">WH: . . .where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">SIDI: . . .

id="s190">Now, many times when we were in a euphoric state we are happy, and we go on vacations and so on, and we ask ourselves, ‘could I have ever, ever as a little boy, you boy, even after the war in the refugee camp, or even in the first ten years living in the United States, could I have ever dreamed that I would have all these things?</span> <span id="s191">I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s192">I couldn’t anticipate.</span> <span id="s193">I didn’t know what the opportunities were.</span> <span id="s194">I mean, it’s by a series of lucky circumstances at a particular point in my life, a decision making point.</span> <span id="s195">That I am where I am.</span> <span id="s196">And this is pure coincidences.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">WH: How do you think it’s changed your

where you specifically point to your experiences, and say, “I learned such and such (inaudible) situation, that I would react in a certain way”</span></p> <p><span id="s207">SN: No, I do not know about actions, -attitudes.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">SIDI: I feel that I have changed in my actions also, in my feelings, in my sensitivities.</span> <span id="s209">How many people get up in the morning and think of enjoying a shower.</span> <span id="s210">And really an enjoyment – not a physical enjoyment, but the fact that you could take a shower by yourself, and have it there.</span> <span id="s211">I speak out much, much more than I would have probably had I not lived through what I lived through.</span> <span id="s212">When I see something, that I think is wrong, I don’t hesitate to speak to these people, or kids on the street.</span> <span id="s213">For example, a kid throws a piece of trash down, I would say, “Hey, pick it up!”</span> <span id="s214">You know, I just, - I just can’t see injustice done in any way, or any misbehavior.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">WH: As a corollary to that, you feel that you have to get it done.</span></p> <p><span

survive.</span> <span id="s737">To go on.</span> <span id="s738">Because when we were in Auschwitz, or in ?</span> <span id="s739">Plashoff?</span> <span id="s740">we knew that there are not going to be any more Jews in this world, and nobody will know what happened to us.</span> <span id="s741">This is what we thought.</span> <span id="s742">Nobody knows, because if they would know, they would help us.</span> <span id="s743">I mean - .</span></p> <p><span id="s744">WH: And you wanted them to know, SIDI: Of course we wanted them to know.</span> <span id="s745">And we were so naïve, that we thought that the nation, if they would know, they would help, right?</span> <span id="s746">So we wanted Judaism to survive and the elders, the older people said, “If anybody survives, please tell them.</span> <span id="s747">Please tell them what happened!</span> <span id="s748">Don’t let it to be forgotten.”</span> <span id="s749">And that was the general idea when we came to the United States, that will to survive was very, very strong.</span> <span id="s750">And each time I gave birth, 1 –although I had anesthesia, or pain, I always said, “Victory over Hitler.</span> <span id="s751">Another victory over Hitler.</span> <span id="s752">Another Jewish child is born” And that was my feeling.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">WH: And that is your feeling when you think of the State of Israel, don’t you?</span></p> <p><span id="s754">SIDI: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">SN: You ask before the question, why do I feel that we went this way or we were able to overcome and lead a reasonably normal life.</span> <span id="s756">I think it also – something to do with our make-up of each individual – background, culture, educational development.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">WH: Where do you see in your background?</span> <span id="s758">Is there anything particular that comes to mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s759">SN: I have been influenced by many people.</span> <span id="s760">Parents, relatives, friends, reading a lot, I always read, childhood on.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">WH: Is there anything . . . your father said to you as a child growing up, any kind of moral.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">SN: I think it’s more of atmosphere . . .a certain style of life.</span> <span id="s763">One person influences me. . . a cousin . . . he broke his back . . .and he passed an equivalency exam of Polish high school in spite of his being Hassidic and in spite of his – being an invalid . . . in spite of his pain, and his discomfort, was

. . .</span></p> <p><span id="s767">SN: When I speak to groups . . .very frequently, I say, I’m proud of survivors, we certainly, after the war, we were a shattered group, we didn’t resort to alcoholism, we didn’t fall into major derogation, so many of us were, we didn’t go into drugs, we didn’t get into deep despondency, we picked ourselves up, certainly with no particular encouragement, or particular solicitude on the part of Jewish agencies beyond standard – procedures, but nothing geared to the particular problem . . . (inaudible) and we did our ting, whatever our thing was.</span> <span id="s768">I mean, look at any other ethnic, national group.</span> <span id="s769">Cultural, racial or whatever, would they have done that same thing?</span> <span id="s770">Perhaps the Japanese, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s771">But, you know, in a few years, look at the country of Israel.</span> <span id="s772">It’s the same trait.</span> <span id="s773">It’s not necessarily limited to survival.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">WH: Do you see the same trait in American Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s775">SN: (pause – thinking).</span> <span id="s776">That’s a toughy.</span> <span id="s777">I think that, if I’m looking at the generation now, who are teen-agers now, and early twenties and so on, I think that the fact that a lot of affluence that you see in so many segments of the Jewish society, make these people unprepared for any sort of atrocity.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">WH: It’s a Jewish trait, but you can lose it.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">SN: But I don’t want these people to be tested!</span> <span id="s780">. . .

Friday night after services, any holiday after service, that if there were strangers in town, they’ll be invited by the people to the houses to spend the holidays.</span> <span id="s810">Now, that’s almost not done anymore . . . and I feel that it’s wrong.</span> <span id="s811">You know, you should welcome people to your community, or whatever, even though you don’t know them.</span> <span id="s812">It is certainly part you know, if they’re Jews, they’re members of a Temple, or not member of a Temple, you should make an effort.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">WH: . . . is there anything else you tried to do – to preserve these values?</span></p> <p><span id="s814">SN: No, just by – I was –I’m active in the Temple, I was President twice, and I am on Committees . . . we have 675 families.</span> <span id="s815">And I speak out.</span> <span id="s816">I speak out if people ask me my advice I gained a reasonable respect in the community.</span> <span id="s817">We had a few years ago, we had a first time a contest, I was asked by the community at large to run against the incumbent president because they felt that this is a crucial time in our congregation . . .they felt that the present leadership was going to steer the (inaudible) of the synagogue in the wrong direction.</span> <span id="s818">(He won election)</span></p> <p><span id="s819">WH: What was wrong?</span> <span id="s820">Religiously wrong?</span></p> <p><span id="s821">SN: Yah.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">WH: To the Left?</span></p> <p><span id="s823">SN: Yah.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">WH: And you were seen as more a Traditionalist?</span></p> <p><span id="s825">SN: Yah. . . and I was actually drafted to run and we had elections, I did win like 70% of the vote so the people supported me.</span> <span id="s826">Then there was no rabbi, and I was acting as a rabbi and I was acting as President.</span> <span id="s827">I was doing everything that needs to be done.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">WH: You’re traditional, more traditional say that probably the average Conservative Jew.</span> <span id="s829">.</span> <span id="s830">You’re not going to the Left . . . you’re more in the Middle?</span></p> <p><span id="s831">SN: Well, in our congregation we accept women in ritual role . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s832">WH: Is there a desire to keep up the tradition that may have something to do . . . with the fact that this is the way it was done?</span></p> <p><span id="s833">SN: No, not the way it was done.</span> <span id="s834">I feel in order for the Jews to stay as a unique identity, outside of Israel, and let me say, I may sound pessimistic, G-d forbid, I thought that Israel may be overrun by the Arabs.</span> <span id="s835">It’s not something that hasn’t entered my mind, repeatedly, so therefore I feel that the American community will be the one that would, to whom to which the role of preserving Judaism as- whether it’s a nation or a religion or a combination of both – will fall.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">WH: Some people said that the American Jewish community will fall.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">SN: I don’t believe that.</span> <span id="s838">You see, that’s where the resiliency comes in.</span> <span id="s839">There is going to be a (?</span> <span id="s840">Shaaret ha?)</span> <span id="s841">whether it’s going to be the Orthodox, certainly I don’t feel the Reform will do it.</span> <span id="s842">I have great doubts about the Conservative . . .
