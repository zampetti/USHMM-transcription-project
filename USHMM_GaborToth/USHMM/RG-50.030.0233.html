and raised in a little town about 20 miles north of Brno called Boskovice.</span> <span id="s22">A city of approximately eight thousand people, where there was a Jewish community dating back into the fifteenth century.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q:Tell us a little bit about your childhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A:About what?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q:Your childhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A:Well, I had a very happy childhood, although I was born before the First World War.</span> <span id="s27">I remember...during the war, I must have been a little bit over three years old and my father was in the army, in the Austrian army.</span> <span id="s28">And my mother--with my...with her sister, with my aunt--brought me home from the little village from where she came in Slovakia; because her mother-in-law, my grandmother, was sick.</span> <span id="s29">She [his grandmother] died.</span> <span id="s30">Then her husband, my grandfather, got sick.</span> <span id="s31">And then I got sick.</span> <span id="s32">And I remember still, very dimly, the day when we came from the railroad station into the apartment.</span> <span id="s33">Well, anyhow when I got sick my mother told the doctor, "Dr. Weiss, this is an infectious diseases, because my mother-in-law passed away.</span> <span id="s34">Now the father-in-law is sick.</span> <span id="s35">And now the...my child got sick."</span> <span id="s36">They finally found out it was typhoid fev...fever.</span> <span id="s37">And... uh...I also remember during that sickness that my aunt coaxed me in eating, after the fever was gone.</span> <span id="s38">And...uh...she told me over a little chicken, which I liked, in my grandmother's home and they made me some soup.</span> <span id="s39">And that was the first meal I ate; and which I heard this story many times later on from my aunt.</span> <span id="s40">Well, my.</span> <span id="s41">.</span> <span id="s42">my...uh...childhood was a happy one.</span> <span id="s43">From the political point of view, in 1918 Czechoslovakia was founded.</span> <span id="s44">Uh...and up to 1920, there was in town a German school which was attended mostly by the children of Jewish parents, and by some non-Jewish children too.</span> <span id="s45">The idea was that the Habsburg monarchy, the system, tried to Germanize wherever they could.</span> <span id="s46">And for that purpose they used minorities; one of them were the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s47">In return, they were getting certain concessions, to which they had to be entitled as full citizens anyways; but it was an abuse which went on through centuries.</span> <span id="s48">And I remember in 1920, when the German school was closed.</span> <span id="s49">And my father was raised in the German language only; although he spoke Czech.</span> <span id="s50">He was ready to move to Vienna, but he changed his mind; and I..</span> <span id="s51">.</span> <span id="s52">all my schooling was Czech, with the exception of...uh...being tutored privately with a few other Jewish children by the former principal of the German school, Mr. Joseph [Meyer (ph)].</span> <span id="s53">I went to elementary school.</span> <span id="s54">I went to gymnasium.</span> <span id="s55">And then I got a job in a ready-to-wear manufacturing place; where I worked until 1936, when I had to join the army.</span> <span id="s56">Our lives there in Boskovice were beautiful.</span> <span id="s57">We had a lot of...uh...opportunities and exploit...exploited them a lot...while, while uh....</span> <span id="s58">Sporting opportunities--like skiing, skating, hiking, swimming.</span> <span id="s59">The little town is located in...in a very scenic section of Moravia.</span> <span id="s60">It was called "the Moravian Swiss."</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q:Was there a strong religious feeling in your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A:Well, there were a few very religious people.</span> <span id="s63">We, personally, were irreligious.</span> <span id="s64">As a matter of fact, my father was an atheist, and so am I. My grandfather was religious.</span> <span id="s65">His wife, my grandmother--is paternal--was not; but she kept a kosher house because of his sake.</span> <span id="s66">And when she passed away, my mother kept a kosher house for his sake--for Grandfather's sake--until he passed away.</span> <span id="s67">He did not live with us, but he ate with us at noontime and dinners; while the breakfast was sent to him in his apartment from our house every morning.</span> <span id="s68">Uh...as soon as Grandfather died, my sister and I said to my mother, "Let's stop with that kosher deal, because we...we don't believe in it.</span> <span id="s69">And we eat...eat everything anyways."</span> <span id="s70">And that was...that was the end of the kosher housekeeping.</span> <span id="s71">I think he died in '32 or '33.</span> <span id="s72">Uh, we...we were a group of Jewish youngsters who had a good time.</span> <span id="s73">Uh...Although we were friendly with the non-Jewish people.</span> <span id="s74">As a matter of fact, I had a few very good friends among them from school and so forth.</span> <span id="s75">But there was a certain social...uh...barrier between the two religions.</span> <span id="s76">And as children, I remember, we had even wars between the Jews and the Christians, where we were throwing at...at each other stones.</span> <span id="s77">And a half an hour later, we played soccer together.</span> <span id="s78">It was just all on friendly, very friendly terms.</span> <span id="s79">And I think that the population there, with the exceptions of course, accepted us as full-fledged citizens.</span> <span id="s80">And the country was at that time democratic under the...the system.</span> <span id="s81">Uh...The president was Tomáš Masaryk, a humanitarian, uh...liberal politician.</span> <span id="s82">And we had...we had a real...very nice life.</span> <span id="s83">Until, of course, the occupation of the country came.</span> <span id="s84">I joined the army 1936.</span> <span id="s85">The...in October, I believe, of 1938, I was still in the army.</span> <span id="s86">The Sudetenland, which were the border regions occupied primarily by German-speaking people, were ceded to Germany.</span> <span id="s87">And in...and I was discharged on February the 28th, in 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q:Can you describe some of the changes, and how the changes began to take place?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A:Well, that comes from...that comes only on after the...the, the...uh...country was partly truncated, and later on occupied entirely.</span> <span id="s90">Then the changes came about.</span> <span id="s91">I was discharged, as I said, at the end of February '39.</span> <span id="s92">And on March the 15th, the German army marched in and...uh....occupied the...the... the remains of Bohemia and Moravia.</span> <span id="s93">I lived in Moravia; while Slovakia, which was another state of the former Czechoslovakia Republic, was at that time already independent--or declared their independence.</span> <span id="s94">Uh...and that what was left was called the "Protektorat" [NB: Protectorate].</span> <span id="s95">The situation right away changed.</span> <span id="s96">Of course, we were already in...in a state of flux.</span> <span id="s97">For instance, we had an affidavit to go to the United States from an uncle--from my mother's brother who lived in Pittsburgh, in Pennsylvania.</span> <span id="s98">And he sent us an affidavit for my sister, my two cousins, [Otto and Edith (ph)], and for myself.</span> <span id="s99">But unfortunately, there was a quota.</span> <span id="s100">And there were, I believe, 1400 some admissions, or 1375 admissions, out of Czechoslovakia into the United States per year.</span> <span id="s101">And that quota was highly over...over subscribed.</span> <span id="s102">We had another opportunity to leave, at that time, for Palestine--or to England, where we even could enter without a visa at the time.</span> <span id="s103">And that take...took quite awhile.</span> <span id="s104">I would say, for at least a year and half.</span> <span id="s105">But we didn't want to leave without anything.</span> <span id="s106">And we also didn't believe that times will be as bad as they actually later on proved to be.</span> <span id="s107">And...uh...so we lived now under these new circumstances.</span> <span id="s108">As soon as the German moved in...Germans moved in, and the...the Gestapo and the SS took charge of the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s109">First of all, I had to go to Prague to register.</span> <span id="s110">Uh...in the...in a building which was left by the Petschek, which is a banking family in...in Prague.</span> <span id="s111">In the Petschek Palace, I had to register.</span> <span id="s112">It took, I believe, two days.</span> <span id="s113">And then I came back home.</span> <span id="s114">And...uh...the restrictions which were imposed on us were gradually increased.</span> <span id="s115">For instance, I had to leave my job where I worked, again in the same plant as when I went into the army.</span> <span id="s116">My boss was a Jewish man.</span> <span id="s117">He got in a uh...what the Germans called "Treuhänder" [Trans: "trustee" or "caretaker"]--a..</span> <span id="s118">.</span> <span id="s119">a German person who actually took over the management of the plant--and he had very...he had no rights anymore then at all.</span> <span id="s120">And I got dismissed.</span> <span id="s121">I got a job in a textile plant which was owned by friends of my parents, Mr. Richard [Fischer (ph)], in a little village close to Boskovice.</span> <span id="s122">And I commuted daily into that plant, and worked there until that plant was taken over by the Germans and I again lost my job.</span> <span id="s123">By the way, during the time I worked in [Hartog (ph)] for Mr. [Fischer (ph)], there was another lady--a young girl at that time, she was about 19 or 20 at the most--who went from Brno, capital of Moravia, sent by her parents also into this little village; because they felt that she might be more secure there than in Brno.</span> <span id="s124">And that's how I met her.</span> <span id="s125">She lives now in Washington, D.C. Survived the war, of course.</span> <span id="s126">I believe she was sent to Sweden during the war.</span> <span id="s127">Now, when I lost the job at [Fischer's (ph)], I approached a gentile man whose name was [_an_k Stan_k (ph)], who was in the ready-to-wear business, manufacturing in Boskovice.</span> <span id="s128">And he said, "Why not?</span> <span id="s129">I had a Jewish fellow before you.</span> <span id="s130">His name is Benno [Langer (ph)]."</span> <span id="s131">I knew him.</span> <span id="s132">He went to Palestine illegally at that time.</span> <span id="s133">"And if you want to come in the morning, you can start next week.</span> <span id="s134">I am expecting a contract from the government for, I believe, 3,000 uh...coats for the army.</span> <span id="s135">And a similar amount of jackets and pants, I think."</span> <span id="s136">And he told me, "I hate to tell you that, but you will have to come a little bit early in the morning and start the fire in the oven.</span> <span id="s137">And you will have to...you will have to...uh...sweep the floor, whatever there will have be done manually."</span> <span id="s138">I says, "That's fine, Mr. [Stan_k (ph)]."</span> <span id="s139">As it turned out, he was there before me; and he made the fire and he swept the floor.</span> <span id="s140">And around 8:30, 9:00, I went to the post office--he had a post office box--and got the mail.</span> <span id="s141">I said to him, "Mr. [Stan_k (ph)], if you don't mind, we have a lot of labor here which have no work."</span> <span id="s142">Because there was a shortage of textiles to manufacture.</span> <span id="s143">And he says, "What do you propose to do?"</span> <span id="s144">And I says, "I would write a letter to the Chamber of Commerce in Vienna."</span> <span id="s145">And I think I picked another city in Germany.</span> <span id="s146">I think Stuttgart.</span> <span id="s147">I don't know why.</span> <span id="s148">"And tell them that we have the labor force, the qualified labor force."</span> <span id="s149">These were all home shops.</span> <span id="s150">These were little shops in homes in the surrounding villages, where the farmland wasn't good enough to support the people.</span> <span id="s151">So they all were tailors, with very few exceptions.</span> <span id="s152">And there was the head of that household, his wife; even the children were sewing and the grandparents were sewing.</span> <span id="s153">And they were specializing in different items.</span> <span id="s154">There was a family who made only slacks.</span> <span id="s155">Another one who made vests.</span> <span id="s156">Others made jackets.</span> <span id="s157">And others made top coats or rain coats.</span> <span id="s158">So he says, "Go ahead."</span> <span id="s159">And I wrote that letter; and we got in a very few days, responses from four people.</span> <span id="s160">From four businesses in Vienna, and the one I think was from Stuttgart.</span> <span id="s161">And we had to...we made up a few samples for them.</span> <span id="s162">And he became in time the largest manufacturer in (laughing) Boskovice for these people.</span> <span id="s163">Now one of them...one of these businesses from Vienna, the name was [Haudigen Grabel (ph)].</span> <span id="s164">These people I met with.</span> <span id="s165">They came to...to us, to see.</span> <span id="s166">And then there was another one, and I forgot the name.</span> <span id="s167">But the merchandise, which was precut with all the bindings, was come...was coming in big...uh...woven containers.</span> <span id="s168">And there were old labels, old metal labels, which read "Sinai and Cohen."</span> <span id="s169">So these German people, these Austrian people in Vienna, must have taken over some business from some Jewish people in Vienna and forgot to take off the...the vignettes.</span> <span id="s170">Well, anyhow, I became...uh...the head man.</span> <span id="s171">Originally, of course, there was only he and myself; and then he took in his nephew.</span> <span id="s172">A young fellow.</span> <span id="s173">His name is [Ladislav Konechni (ph)].</span> <span id="s174">Very nice fellow.</span> <span id="s175">And we were really very busy.</span> <span id="s176">And I did the best I could for our labor, too, because I paid the highest rates.</span> <span id="s177">There were different classes of...grades of....</span> <span id="s178">For instance, for a pair of pants you could pay from, say, 10 crowns a piece to maybe 18 crowns--depending on the grade.</span> <span id="s179">I put everything in the highest grade; because I figured, "Let the Germans pay.</span> <span id="s180">And that local people, they need the money here."</span> <span id="s181">And these people appreciated...appreciated me very much.</span> <span id="s182">And many of them knew me from the place where I worked before.</span> <span id="s183">And they were bringing us now from their little farms butter, chicken, and even fish from the pond.</span> <span id="s184">In one little village, there was a pond.</span> <span id="s185">And I..</span> <span id="s186">.</span> <span id="s187">we had so much food, I didn't know if I can bring this to the place where I worked; but I told them where to deposit it with my parents...that we helped other people.</span> <span id="s188">Because at that time, the restrictions were already very strict.</span> <span id="s189">The Jewish people...first of all, you had cards.</span> <span id="s190">You had ration cards.</span> <span id="s191">But the Jewish people were allowed to shop only from 3 to 4 in the afternoon, when everything was gone anyways.</span> <span id="s192">Yet we had more chicken, fowl and butter and eggs in the house than ever before.</span> <span id="s193">Which my mother paid for it as soon as we got it.</span> <span id="s194">And this man paid me really a very decent salary.</span> <span id="s195">I..</span> <span id="s196">I made a lot of money with him--uh, relatively, you know.</span> <span id="s197">With what I started, I would say I did at least five times as much than when I started to work for him.</span> <span id="s198">And he appreciated me very much, too.</span> <span id="s199">Now, these people from Stuttgart, for those we made raincoats.</span> <span id="s200">And when we made up the first sample, they wanted to know how much yardage we need per raincoat.</span> <span id="s201">I mean, for a set of all sizes.</span> <span id="s202">And we wrote them whatever it was.</span> <span id="s203">I think the merchandise were...was a little bit wider, whatever; it happened from each...so many raincoats, we had one for ourselves.</span> <span id="s204">And this Mr. [Stan_k (ph)], he collected the yard goods and took it home, in his house.</span> <span id="s205">I have never seen that; but I found out after the war that one day he had trouble.</span> <span id="s206">And his cage with the materials was found in his house, and I believe he got arrested.</span> <span id="s207">And that was the end of Mr. [Stan_k (ph)].</span> <span id="s208">Now where did I stop?</span> <span id="s209">Uh, yes.</span> <span id="s210">I was working; and later on, then we had to wear Jewish stars on the chest of our attire.</span> <span id="s211">Around 10 every morning, I went home for a little snack.</span> <span id="s212">It wasn't far--maybe a block from his place to my home.</span> <span id="s213">And...uh...but coming back to restrictions.</span> <span id="s214">For instance, we could not take out more than 500 crowns a week, per family, from our own accounts.</span> <span id="s215">We had restrictions for shopping.</span> <span id="s216">We had no...no...uh...ration cards for clothing at all; only for food.</span> <span id="s217">All the Jewish people who lived outside what at one time was the ghetto part, were moved from their homes into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s218">And we, in our house--which was above my father's business--uh, accommodated Mr. and Mrs. [Werner (ph)], whose great niece I knew when she was a little girl coming to Boskovice in summer to visit her grand...grandmother, who was our neighbor.</span> <span id="s219">And this lady, who lives today in Switzerland, I visited with her with my wife this last summer.</span> <span id="s220">But during the war--I now go far ahead--when the Germans in the camp asked us to send out mail into the neutral countries, so that they would have an alibi that the Jewish people are living in Poland, I wrote to [Mimi (ph)].</span> <span id="s221">And about six weeks later, a courier came from the German army with a bunch of mail, and called out names.</span> <span id="s222">By then, I was the only one who was still alive of all those people who wrote into the neutral countries.</span> <span id="s223">And she even sent me, I believe, some sardines, which I got also.</span> <span id="s224">Uh, yeah.</span> <span id="s225">What...I don't know how I came into...into this...into this story.</span> <span id="s226">Well, anyhow, the restrictions.</span> <span id="s227">The other restriction was we could not leave the house past 8 in the evening, and we could not travel.</span> <span id="s228">The life was really miserable and intolerable.</span> <span id="s229">And we heard stories that somebody was taken away.</span> <span id="s230">The SS came once in awhile to town and took hostages--two, three people.</span> <span id="s231">In most cases, Jewish people.</span> <span id="s232">My father was arrested; and my mother had the courage to go with him to Brno, into the Gestapo offices.</span> <span id="s233">And there the SS man says to her, "Who are you?"</span> <span id="s234">She says, "I'm the wife of Mr. Ticho, and I want to be there when he's interviewed."</span> <span id="s235">And they let her come in.</span> <span id="s236">And they wanted to know from my father whether there are any connections between the gentile people and the Jewish people--uh, politically.</span> <span id="s237">But he never gave them any information.</span> <span id="s238">I know he probably didn't have any, anyways; but he...he wouldn't do that.</span> <span id="s239">And after a week of hearings, he was sent back home.</span> <span id="s240">Well, now comes March 1942.</span> <span id="s241">On March the 10th, I was walking home from this...from the little factory, and on the street I met Dr. Munk.</span> <span id="s242">By the way, other restrictions were this: we had to do manual work.</span> <span id="s243">Sweep the streets from snow or from debris, whatever there was.</span> <span id="s244">Dr. Munk, who was our dentist, had to cut woods in the yard of the...of the city...city council, whatever it was.</span> <span id="s245">I was very friendly with Dr. Munk.</span> <span id="s246">And as we met, he says to me, "Did you hear?"</span> <span id="s247">I says, "What?"</span> <span id="s248">He says, "We are being deported."</span> <span id="s249">And with that, I left Dr. Munk--which was about half way between my place of.</span> <span id="s250">.</span> <span id="s251">uh...employment and my home--and when I came home, my mother says, "Do you know what happened?"</span> <span id="s252">I says, "Yes, Mom.</span> <span id="s253">Dr. Munk already told me."</span> <span id="s254">And the orders were...that was...I don't know what the 10th was, but it was probably a Monday or a Tuesday.</span> <span id="s255">We have to leave within three days, in three equal amounts of people: Friday morning, Saturday morning, and Sunday morning.</span> <span id="s256">And we can take with us whatever we can carry.</span> <span id="s257">Well, I went back to work and told Mr. [Stan_k (ph)]--and accidently, that day the representatives of the owner of [Haudigen Grabel (ph)] were there.</span> <span id="s258">And, uh, as I came in...I talked German.</span> <span id="s259">Mr. [Stan_k (ph)] didn't.</span> <span id="s260">And I was translating; and I says, "Mr. [Stan_k (ph)], I'm sorry, but I have to give you notice.</span> <span id="s261">I'll be here Friday the last day, I think; because on Sunday morning, we are leaving town.</span> <span id="s262">We are being deported."</span> <span id="s263">And these [Haudigen Grabel (ph)], I told them this thing too.</span> <span id="s264">They listened to it in German; and ...uh, they just...I think they resented the fact that they are losing somebody with who they could converse and was an expert in the trade.</span> <span id="s265">But otherwise they didn't give a hoot anyways.</span> <span id="s266">So that was the story about how it came about that we have be...that we will be deported.</span> <span id="s267">I have at home a list of all the Jewish people who got deported within those three days, and there is an addition to how many were arrested before deportation.</span> <span id="s268">Among the deportees, the bulk are local Jewish residents; but there were many who either came to visit with relatives from other cities, and also a concentration of a few Jewish families from little villages.</span> <span id="s269">They were not allowed to stay there any longer.</span> <span id="s270">Long before the deportation.</span> <span id="s271">There were, if I remember well, 447 [NB: persons].</span> <span id="s272">(Sigh) I think that about eight or ten came back alive after the war.</span> <span id="s273">Among them, one family--husband, wife and a little girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q:(Coughing) Excuse me.</span> <span id="s275">(Coughing)</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A:The family which came back and saved their life....uh...was really coincidental.</span> <span id="s277">Mr. [Hanauk (ph)], who owned a hardware store, was by profession a blacksmith.</span> <span id="s278">Not a blacksmith, but a smith for locks--a locksmith.</span> <span id="s279">And when he came to Terezín, they needed somebody...</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q:(Coughing)</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A:They needed somebody who would take care of the waterworks, and he was qualified.</span> <span id="s282">That's why he survived with his wife and his daughter in Terezín all those years.</span> <span id="s283">And he was among the eight or ten which came back.</span> <span id="s284">We were very friendly with...with that family, as a matter of fact.</span> <span id="s285">Well, now...we left on the 13th of March.</span> <span id="s286">Took with us whatever we could.</span> <span id="s287">No, we left on the 15th of March.</span> <span id="s288">That was the last transport in the morning; by local train to another little station and from there on the main route into Brno, which is the capital of Moravia.</span> <span id="s289">And there we landed in a school called Senefelderschule.</span> <span id="s290">My number, which each got on a big cardboard, the transport number was AC and my number was 363.</span> <span id="s291">On the 17th of March, we left late at night for Terezín, which is a city in northern Bohemia where the Germans evacuated all the non-Jewish people, used the barracks to house the Jews.</span> <span id="s292">That city at that time was already surrounded by fences; and it was a ghetto which was served as...which served as a transient station to...to evacuate the people from there again farther east.</span> <span id="s293">In Terezín, we were separated by sexes.</span> <span id="s294">My mother and my sister was in one barrack, and my father with myself were in another barrack.</span> <span id="s295">We didn't stay there too long, because on April 18th...no, on April the 18th, we--I'm sorry, on March the 18th we arrived in Bohušovice, which is the railroad station from where we had to walk to Terezín.</span> <span id="s296">And the luggage was brought into...into Terezín.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q:We have to just....</span> <span id="s298">I'd like to go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q:To the departure.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q:And don't worry about the dates.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A:That's all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q:Don't worry about that.</span> <span id="s305">Can you describe your departure?</span> <span id="s306">Can you describe the trip to Terezín?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A:(Sigh) The departure from Boskovice?</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A:Well, it was a great anxiety among the people.</span> <span id="s310">They didn't know what to do, what not to do and...uh....</span> <span id="s311">For...for instance, I had buried in the little yard under a big stone a tin box with some of our jewelry, and also with some of the jewelry which my uncle sent us from Slovakia, in the yard.</span> <span id="s312">Yet during the war, before we left, we had to take in into a spare room another fellow which was not Jewish; and he lived in our house.</span> <span id="s313">And on that day when we were moving out in the morning to go to the railroad station, each with suitcase or whatever we could drag, he was already stealing from what we left there into his own room.</span> <span id="s314">Now speaking of this, when I came back in 1945 I took the...the man who worked for my original boss, and who was the...the...uh...man who handled packages, um.</span> <span id="s315">What do you called it?</span> <span id="s316">A menial laborer.</span> <span id="s317">And I says to him, "Joseph, take a pick and a shovel, and let's go with me into our house where we used to live."</span> <span id="s318">And we got into the yard; and I says, "Dig here."</span> <span id="s319">And I show him where to dig.</span> <span id="s320">And in the window, in that L-shaped home, there was that fellow who still lived there after we left...in 1945.</span> <span id="s321">And we found nothing.</span> <span id="s322">And he hollers from up there, he says, "I didn't take anything.</span> <span id="s323">It must be there."</span> <span id="s324">And I says, "If you didn't take it, then it must be here."</span> <span id="s325">And I says, "Try farther."</span> <span id="s326">And he found that stone, lifted the stone and there was that box, a little bit larger than this and about that tall...that high.</span> <span id="s327">The linoleum cover which I put on--it wasn't linoleum, it was an oil cloth--entirely disintegrated.</span> <span id="s328">The box disintegrated in that wet, probably acidy soil; but everything else was there in the shape of that box.</span> <span id="s329">And I picked the stuff up and this (laughing) guy was looking, and he was probably sorry that he didn't know the thing is there.</span> <span id="s330">So that was one of the things, how...how we had to handle ourselves.</span> <span id="s331">Uh... I also remember one evening, I was looking out from where our apartment was, from the second floor down on the street; which is actually the first floor in this country.</span> <span id="s332">So it wasn't too high from the pavement where people walked.</span> <span id="s333">And I noticed two fellows as they were...walked by, and they saw us and they said, "What the Hell.</span> <span id="s334">They can't walk out now.</span> <span id="s335">But they had enough of a good time."</span> <span id="s336">That was the feeling at least of that...of one part of the population.</span> <span id="s337">We also hid my sister's dowry long before that happened, because we were very insecure what might happen or might not happen with people which we knew.</span> <span id="s338">Gentile people.</span> <span id="s339">And most of it I got back after the war.</span> <span id="s340">Uh, other restrictions...just terror and...uh, the...the insecurity.</span> <span id="s341">Nobody knew what the next day will bring.</span> <span id="s342">As a matter of fact, I remember one very interesting thing.</span> <span id="s343">There were some SS men in town; and they were led around by a German fellow who lived in the city and who used to be the policeman for the Jewish community when it existed yet.</span> <span id="s344">That was a separate political entity up 'til 1918.</span> <span id="s345">His name was [Estelberger (ph)].</span> <span id="s346">And he took these SS men around, and they at that time arrested two people.</span> <span id="s347">One fellow who lives now in New York, a survivor--his name is Kurt [Steckemacher (ph)], now Kurt Steel.</span> <span id="s348">And the other one did not survive; his name was [Lam (ph)].</span> <span id="s349">And as they passed by my house, I walk out of the house and they see me.</span> <span id="s350">And [Estelberger (ph)] knew me.</span> <span id="s351">And they ignored me.</span> <span id="s352">They could have just taken me along like anybody else.</span> <span id="s353">That was the only encounter I had at that time with meeting, physically, an SS man--who passed by while I was locking the house.</span> <span id="s354">Right now, I don't remember of any...uh...specifics.</span> <span id="s355">Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s356">This Mr. [Hanauk (ph)] was also arrested for a couple of weeks, but what...was let out again.</span> <span id="s357">That is the man who later on worked on the waterworks in Terezín.</span> <span id="s358">And I..</span> <span id="s359">.</span> <span id="s360">then I remember an industrialist of the same name as mine, Ticho.</span> <span id="s361">His name was Paul Ticho; was arrested, brought into the Spielberg, which used to be a medieval jail--torture chambers; and I believe he died, either there or in Germany someplace.</span> <span id="s362">His son, an opthamologist, lives today in Chicago.</span> <span id="s363">I'm in touch with him.</span> <span id="s364">Dr. Karl Ticho.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q:Let's get back to the trip to Terezín.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A:Alright.</span> <span id="s367">We...we slept on straw in the Senefelderschule.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q:Are you on the train yet?</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A:No, no.</span> <span id="s370">We are in the school now.</span> <span id="s371">And one evening, we got orders to get out.</span> <span id="s372">And we went by street car to the railroad station, where we were rushed under police...uh ...uh... supervision into the train with many other people from Brno, or maybe from surrounding towns.</span> <span id="s373">And we traveled through the night.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q:What was it like?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A:It was a crowded train.</span> <span id="s376">That's all I remember.</span> <span id="s377">And from there I somehow managed to throw out my postcard, which I wrote to my uncle, in some station.</span> <span id="s378">I don't know anymore how that happened; but I knew that I acted already actually illegally.</span> <span id="s379">But it...it got to the destination, because it got back to me after the war.</span> <span id="s380">Then we arrived in Bohušovice, which is the railroad station for Terezín, and from there we were marched into Terezín.</span> <span id="s381">And the...our luggage came later by truck, I believe.</span> <span id="s382">It was delivered to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q:And then what happened?</span> <span id="s384">You don't need to worry about this.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A:No, no.</span> <span id="s386">But I have to get my points a little bit.</span> <span id="s387">(Checking notes) On October the lst, another transport under the insignia A/G was assembled in Theresienstadt [NB: Terezín].</span> <span id="s388">There were quite a few people from Boskovice.</span> <span id="s389">Among them: my parents, my sister and myself.</span> <span id="s390">Uh...We had to walk back to Bohušovice...to Bohušovice...to the railroad station, again with our luggage.</span> <span id="s391">We got some food.</span> <span id="s392">I think bread, some beet marmalade, and something which was like a soft sausage--like big bologna.</span> <span id="s393">And we're put into a regular train--one thousand people--which went through Dresden, _aga_ [Ger: Sagan], Breslau--which is today Wroc_aw--_ód_, and Lublin; and into a railroad station of the little town of Trawniki.</span> <span id="s394">We arrived there on the 3rd of April, very early in the morning, and were disembarked.</span> <span id="s395">We're told that the luggage will be sent to us; and we were marched to the ghetto of Piaski, P-I-A-S-K-I, which was 14 kilometers from Trawniki.</span> <span id="s396">Which is about nine miles.</span> <span id="s397">When we got to Piaski, uh...we were told that we will be living here.</span> <span id="s398">In Piaski, the Germans established a ghetto, which was that part of Piaski where the original Jewish people were living.</span> <span id="s399">There were fences all around, barbed wire and wooden fences.</span> <span id="s400">The ghetto was divided into two halves by the main road leading from Lublin into, I believe, Che_m and Zamo__.</span> <span id="s401">And we were looking where to go to settle.</span> <span id="s402">And we found...finally found....</span> <span id="s403">By the way, I don't know where I was in the interim.</span> <span id="s404">My mother and father told me when I came back to them--I must have gone for about half an hour--there was some kind of a meeting, and a German officer told them that everything will be taken care of.</span> <span id="s405">We will get straw to sleep on, and fuel and food.</span> <span id="s406">And electricity will be installed.</span> <span id="s407">Gave us a big spiel, big story.</span> <span id="s408">But nothing happened.</span> <span id="s409">We finally found an abandoned house without any floors.</span> <span id="s410">The floors were used as fuel from people who lived there before.</span> <span id="s411">There were holes in the ceiling, in the...in the roof.</span> <span id="s412">And we slept on the floor; which were my family and another couple, Mr. and Mrs. Julius [Frisch (ph)] from Boskovice--with who we were also very friendly.</span> <span id="s413">(Sigh) My sister got an infection in her eyes, and got blind from that humidity and whatever.</span> <span id="s414">The food was almost none; until the Jewish Federation there in Piaski established a kitchen, where we were getting daily uh l pot of soup per person and some bread.</span> <span id="s415">The situation was absolutely unbelievable.</span> <span id="s416">No toilets.</span> <span id="s417">No pots, no pans.</span> <span id="s418">I mean, nothing.</span> <span id="s419">Our luggage never arrived.</span> <span id="s420">They left in Trawniki at the time 50 people-- 50 men, who were supposed to unload the luggage and load it then onto a truck and bring it into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s421">The luggage did not come.</span> <span id="s422">Whether these 50 people came later or not, I don't remember.</span> <span id="s423">You cannot imagine the despair.</span> <span id="s424">A week later about, maybe...maybe only 6 days later, there was a what we called a "razzia" [Trans: "roundup"].</span> <span id="s425">Uh...In English, I would call it a surrounding of that...that...uh...little area, and they evacuated at that time only local Jews.</span> <span id="s426">The local Jews, they were wearing white armbands with a blue star of David.</span> <span id="s427">And there were also some Pomeranian Jews, from Pomerania, from the city of Szczecin [Ger: Stettin].</span> <span id="s428">When we got acquainted with a local family, their name was [Niederberg (ph)].</span> <span id="s429">He manufactured during peace time, I believe, candles and soap.</span> <span id="s430">And they told us to move fast into a second floor, into an apartment.</span> <span id="s431">Apartment!</span> <span id="s432">Was a room deal, steps up; but it was dry.</span> <span id="s433">And the...the roof didn't have any holes.</span> <span id="s434">To move in fast before somebody else take it, which we did.</span> <span id="s435">So we got into the apartment, in which prior to us lived a Dr. [Hanf (ph)], a rabbi from Szczecin.</span> <span id="s436">There was nothing in it but some onions left.</span> <span id="s437">There was a stove in the foreroom, which is actually a partition from the larger room was in the back.</span> <span id="s438">In the kitchen there was one bed.</span> <span id="s439">In the room in the rear, there were two beds.</span> <span id="s440">All with straw mattresses.</span> <span id="s441">And on the landing of the steps, when you get up there, there was a bucket which was used as a toilet.</span> <span id="s442">If you wanted water, you had to go...we went....</span> <span id="s443">We were in that part of the ghetto which had no water supply.</span> <span id="s444">You had to cross the street from this part to the other part; but the ghetto doors were opened every two hours, and closed every two hours.</span> <span id="s445">From 8 to l0, you could go into the other part to get water; but at 10 o'clock it was closed until 12.</span> <span id="s446">Then you could go again from 12 to 2.</span> <span id="s447">And that...that's how it worked.</span> <span id="s448">Now there was a..</span> <span id="s449">.</span> <span id="s450">what they called "Ghetto Polizei," which was the ghetto police.</span> <span id="s451">These were Jewish people, everything ordered by the Germans.</span> <span id="s452">They also nominated a committee of 12 elders.</span> <span id="s453">Among them there were two Czech people, a Mr. Kurt [Hirschmann (ph)] and a, uh, engineer, [Ernst Boehm (ph)], with his wife...who was there with his wife.</span> <span id="s454">[Hirschmann (ph)], I believe, ...yeah, he was with his wife there, too.</span> <span id="s455">But I bring this up for the reason to understand how the thing operated.</span> <span id="s456">The Judenrat was getting orders from the Germans, and they had to comply; and were actually instruments for the Germans.</span> <span id="s457">Well, luckily by the end of, uh, April, we heard that they are looking for plenty...for 20 young people who would work on a farm.</span> <span id="s458">Ten German, of German nationality, and 10 of Czech.</span> <span id="s459">And I got among the 10 of the Czech nationality, and got the job working from 7 in the morning 'til 7 at night on a huge estate in Siedliszczki.</span> <span id="s460">Uh...Just a minute.</span> <span id="s461">(Checking notes)</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q:You know, it may be best if you go from just what comes to your mind, rather than....</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A:Yeah, but I would forget many important things.</span> <span id="s464">Now, I believe it was... Yah, I got the job.</span> <span id="s465">We went onto this estate every morning; and as we got a little bit smarter, we started to smuggle out things from the ghetto and was peddling them at noon time from one little home to the other in that village, to the local people.</span> <span id="s466">We also were lucky that the administrator of the estate--I forgot now his name--was very tolerant and understanding to us, and he let us steal.</span> <span id="s467">Virtually, let us steal potatoes and vegetables; and even, if he could, some flour.</span> <span id="s468">Whatever it was.</span> <span id="s469">We...our...uh...our wages were, at noontime, we got a pot of boiled potatoes with some milk.</span> <span id="s470">And every week we were getting two kilograms, which is a little bit over four pounds, of either flour or barley.</span> <span id="s471">And he was giving us--against the directions from the Germans--every day, I believe for eight or 10 people, one big loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s472">And there we...we worked.</span> <span id="s473">I got acquainted through this trading with a farmer whose name I didn't know.</span> <span id="s474">Uh, then another incidents come into my mind; and it was on June the 22nd, first anniversary of the Russian-German war, I traded--I don't know anymore what it was--for eight kilogram of flour the day before.</span> <span id="s475">And I left it on the farm.</span> <span id="s476">And the next morning, I asked the supervisor--who took us into the fields where we worked on the meadows, barn, whatever--whether he would let me run home--which was three kilometers, maybe two miles--with this flour.</span> <span id="s477">Because I was afraid if I go in the evening with the rest, the Germans checked on us what we are having with us.</span> <span id="s478">And if you had some contraband, they shot you on the spot.</span> <span id="s479">And then told the...the Jewish policeman at the ghetto gates, "There's somebody shot and lying in a ditch over there.</span> <span id="s480">Get and buried him."</span> <span id="s481">So I didn't want to do that, to bring this home in the evening.</span> <span id="s482">And the foreman told me, "There is just now a wagon going through Piaski.</span> <span id="s483">Hop on the wagon and come back."</span> <span id="s484">Which I did; and when I got to the ghetto gate, I jumped down, brought the flour in.</span> <span id="s485">And my mother was on the landing, standing; and she says, "How coming you're coming home?</span> <span id="s486">I hope you didn't lose the job."</span> <span id="s487">Because that was more or less a sub...subsistence for....for my people, what I brought home.</span> <span id="s488">And I says, "No, Mom.</span> <span id="s489">I got eight...eight kilo of flour, and I brought it home now."</span> <span id="s490">And explained, and kissed her goodbye and left; and run back in...onto the farm.</span> <span id="s491">(Sigh) At noontime, or maybe past noontime--no, I think it was right around noontime--somebody discovered people walking through the fields.</span> <span id="s492">And we crawled on top of the blacksmith's shop; and we saw a huge transport being walked through the fields, direction Trawniki.</span> <span id="s493">By the way, before I left I said to my mother, "If anything goes wrong, you know where to go to hide."</span> <span id="s494">We knew already how to get there.</span> <span id="s495">"Hide."</span> <span id="s496">They didn't.</span> <span id="s497">When I came home in the evening, they were gone.</span> <span id="s498">My parents and my sister were gone, and so was my winter coat.</span> <span id="s499">I had at that time a brand new winter coat, which is the only real valuable thing next to what I had--my suit, slacks, and shoes.</span> <span id="s500">That's all I had.</span> <span id="s501">One pair of change.</span> <span id="s502">Nothing else.</span> <span id="s503">Nobody else had more, either.</span> <span id="s504">That was the situation.</span> <span id="s505">And whatever we smuggled was from people who had something who came there earlier, or whatever.</span> <span id="s506">Uh, but from that transport from which we came, they had nothing; although they sold their last shirt just to get...for...for a few potatoes.</span> <span id="s507">Well, I came home in the evening.</span> <span id="s508">And in the meantime, between the arrival of the second transport whose insignia was A/L, there arrived my aunt, Rosa.</span> <span id="s509">That was my father's sister's widow.</span> <span id="s510">A Mrs. Weiner, who was a widow, with her daughter [Litzi (ph)]; her sister, Mrs. [Frisch (ph)].</span> <span id="s511">Mrs. Weiner was born [Frisch (ph)]; and their niece, Mrs. [Rotter (ph)].</span> <span id="s512">My father's cousin, Benjamin Ticho; and a nephew of Mr. [Frisch (ph)], Fred.</span> <span id="s513">And we took them all in, because they had no place where else to go.</span> <span id="s514">Now we were 13 people.</span> <span id="s515">The [Frisch (ph)] couple slept in the so-called kitchen, on those two beds.</span> <span id="s516">My mother and my sister slept in one bed.</span> <span id="s517">My father, and I believe his cousin, in the other bed in the back room.</span> <span id="s518">And all the rest slept on the floor.</span> <span id="s519">With one bucket!</span> <span id="s520">Two days later--by the way, the people were dying in the ghetto of starvation and of sicknesses.</span> <span id="s521">Uh, and the SS once in awhile came to check; asking how many people died yesterday and how many the week before, and so forth.</span> <span id="s522">And the amounts were considerable, but to them it wasn't fast enough.</span> <span id="s523">Now, two days later, after this transport left....</span> <span id="s524">And prior to that, there were also surround...surroundings of...of local people, of the people in the ghetto by the Germans [NB: razzias].</span> <span id="s525">But my...my parents and my people and all the rest evaded them.</span> <span id="s526">But on the 22nd, they didn't...they didn't make it anymore.</span> <span id="s527">Two day later, I believe, some 80 people come back from the transport which was taken out on the 22nd.</span> <span id="s528">And among there...them, were these four ladies.</span> <span id="s529">Mrs. Weiner, Mrs. [Frisch (ph)], and Mrs. [Rotter (ph)]; and [Litzi (ph)] Weiner.</span> <span id="s530">They told me that they were taken to Trawniki under horrible conditions.</span> <span id="s531">Beaten on the way.</span> <span id="s532">And were squeezed into cattle trains; but the train was so crowded that these 80 people couldn't...were not anymore being located...placed in the train.</span> <span id="s533">So they were put overnight into some barn; and finally, the third day they came home.</span> <span id="s534">Without water, even to get anything to drink.</span> <span id="s535">No food.</span> <span id="s536">They were in terrible shape.</span> <span id="s537">And Mrs. Weiner told me that my father took my winter coat with him, because he was afraid somebody might steal it before I get back home in the evening, assuming that I will follow them.</span> <span id="s538">And then she also told me that Marianne, my sister, said, "I think we are making a terrible mistake by not going into hiding."</span> <span id="s539">That was all I knew about my parents.</span> <span id="s540">Now, as I'll still continued working on the...on that estate, I got acquainted...not too much, but I knew the man already.</span> <span id="s541">And one day I says to him, "Would you uh give me a job on your farm?</span> <span id="s542">I don't have to get...to the back ghetto now, because my parents and my sister are gone.</span> <span id="s543">And I could sleep in your house."</span> <span id="s544">I figured I would be safe there.</span> <span id="s545">And he says, "I'll take you in a couple...couple weeks."</span> <span id="s546">Couple weeks came.</span> <span id="s547">I didn't even ask for a release from that old job; but I simply went into his house.</span> <span id="s548">He gave me there...in a very little room, there was a box-like contraption on four legs, with a lid.</span> <span id="s549">It was maybe 30 inches wide and maybe six feet long.</span> <span id="s550">It was full of straw.</span> <span id="s551">And he told me, "You will sleep in this here."</span> <span id="s552">And...uh...we worked together.</span> <span id="s553">I talked some Polish.</span> <span id="s554">I picked it up; because Czech and Polish, they are two Slavic languages, and I picked up a little bit.</span> <span id="s555">I moved in with my rucksack, and whatever...the little things I had.</span> <span id="s556">And I asked in the evening for some water to wash.</span> <span id="s557">From that day on, Mrs. Podsiadli gave me every night a big pot of hot water and a basin, where I washed myself daily.</span> <span id="s558">And they were very considerate.</span> <span id="s559">They always...in, in the Polish language, you address somebody by the third person--like, "the Mr. should do this"--and I was "the Mr." It is unbelievable how respectful and considerate these people were to me.</span> <span id="s560">And I..</span> <span id="s561">.</span> <span id="s562">they didn't owe me anything.</span> <span id="s563">But anyhow, I worked with them.</span> <span id="s564">On weekends I went back to the ghetto, and I visited with the few people who I knew.</span> <span id="s565">Among others, these four ladies; and they told me....</span> <span id="s566">They moved in the meantime from the part of the ghetto where there was no water into the part where there was water, into a home owned by a fellow of the name Goldfarb.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q:I think this is a good place to stop.</span> <span id="s568">We have to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A:I tell you.</span> <span id="s570">It's a good place for me too, because I want to rest up a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q:Sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION</span></p> <p><span id="s573">TAPE #2</span></p> <p><span id="s574">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q:We're on now.</span> <span id="s576">You may begin.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A:Uh, I want to come back to transport A/L.</span> <span id="s578">In Lublin, they took out all men, up to age 50 or 55.</span> <span id="s579">That's why my Aunt Rosa arrived without her son, my cousin Irving, who was a year older than I am.</span> <span id="s580">And that's why Mrs. [Rotter (ph)] also arrived without her husband--who was a veterinarian--who was taken out in Lublin together with all the other young men.</span> <span id="s581">As a matter of fact, she used to get mail from him once in awhile.</span> <span id="s582">He worked for the SS, for their horses, in Lublin.</span> <span id="s583">Until somehow either she didn't get any mail anymore, or she left.</span> <span id="s584">.</span> <span id="s585">uh.</span> <span id="s586">.</span> <span id="s587">Piaski.</span> <span id="s588">Well (pause--checking notes), ...I want to correct something.</span> <span id="s589">The amount of people who came back from Trawniki--and I have this from my old notes--were approximately 500, not 80.</span> <span id="s590">I don't know where I got the number, but I just noticed it here.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q:Let's get back to your experience now.</span> <span id="s592">Let's pick it up.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A:Yah.</span> <span id="s594">(Pause) Uh, out of the June transport in which my parents were, we got later on word--and that was I think official--that 50 men are working in Che_m on a railroad station.</span> <span id="s595">And among them was a friend of mine.</span> <span id="s596">His name was Paul [Maurewitz (ph)].</span> <span id="s597">He was looking for his wife, and for my parents and sister.</span> <span id="s598">And I..</span> <span id="s599">.</span> <span id="s600">I think I sent him somehow, or tried to send him, some money.</span> <span id="s601">Anyhow I..</span> <span id="s602">.</span> <span id="s603">the news was that they arrived in some camp, and were taken out and sent to Che_m to work.</span> <span id="s604">And at that time it didn't make any sense to me; but later on, after I went through the additional trouble, I know now what happened.</span> <span id="s605">During a transport which arrived in Sobibór, they took out 80 people.</span> <span id="s606">Mostly who were out of the typographical printing trade.</span> <span id="s607">Among them, who was the 81st, was a fellow who noticed that all his friends and they arrived from a transport from Holland, are there--these 80...80 people separated.</span> <span id="s608">And he asked an SS man whether he couldn't join them; and that SS pushed him in there.</span> <span id="s609">This fellow's name is Jules [Skelvis (ph)].</span> <span id="s610">He is the only survivor of this group of 81 people who was for l hour in Sobibór.</span> <span id="s611">And I understand now that when the transport of June the 22nd arrived, they needed some labor.</span> <span id="s612">At the railroad station in Che_m, they took 50 men and that's why they were there.</span> <span id="s613">But those 50 men did not know what happened to those who were left in Sobibór; until I talked to Jules [Skelvis (ph)], who is kind of a..</span> <span id="s614">.</span> <span id="s615">I would say a semi-professional historian.</span> <span id="s616">And he told me, "I don't know you."</span> <span id="s617">And I was in...I knew everybody in the camp.</span> <span id="s618">He says, "I was there only for l hour."</span> <span id="s619">And he explained to me what happened to him.</span> <span id="s620">Well, let's continue.</span> <span id="s621">During the harvest time, I worked with the hired help of my farmer, Podsiadli.</span> <span id="s622">His name was [Watzek (ph)].</span> <span id="s623">He worked for l year.</span> <span id="s624">That was the contract--for food, lodging and seven sacks of grain.</span> <span id="s625">And at one time when we were working together out there, he told me...when I mentioned my parents, he says to me, "You will never see them again."</span> <span id="s626">But he could...wouldn't tell me any detail or didn't know any; but I think that he knew something what was going on.</span> <span id="s627">But of all, what I can't understand, that we never put together what the actual aim of the system was.</span> <span id="s628">We always hoped tomorrow will better than today, but actually it was getting worse tomorrow instead of better.</span> <span id="s629">And...uh...that's.</span> <span id="s630">.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q:In what way was it getting worse for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s632">A:From Boskovice to Brno, from Brno to Terezín, from Terezín to Piaski, from Piaski...uh....</span> <span id="s633">It was always worse.</span> <span id="s634">And the end station was actually being annihilated.</span> <span id="s635">That was the ...the end result, and the aim of the Germans what to do with...with us.</span> <span id="s636">It was a system which...which was thoroughly thought out, mechanically and psychologically.</span> <span id="s637">Well...uh, at the end of October, all permits were taken away from the Jewish people who worked out in the country.</span> <span id="s638">And I told my farmer and his wife, I says, "I'm sorry but I will have to leave because they are taking away our permits."</span> <span id="s639">And she told me, "The Mr. should stay with us and hide in the barn.</span> <span id="s640">And we will kill a..</span> <span id="s641">.</span> <span id="s642">uh...pig; and we will eat all winter pork and cabbage.</span> <span id="s643">And in Spring, everything will be quiet down anyways and we will start working together again."</span> <span id="s644">I considered it, but I was afraid.</span> <span id="s645">And I left in the afternoon; and on the way to the ghetto toward me was coming a Polish man.</span> <span id="s646">He was drunk.</span> <span id="s647">And he couldn't ride his bike.</span> <span id="s648">He used the bike as a support.</span> <span id="s649">And as we come close he says to me, "Jew, where are you going to?"</span> <span id="s650">I says, "I'm going to the ghetto."</span> <span id="s651">And that was in Polish.</span> <span id="s652">And he says to me, "[Nie wchodzi_ do getta.</span> <span id="s653">Ti dosz zabi_ (ph)]."</span> <span id="s654">"Don't go into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s655">They'll kill you."</span> <span id="s656">He must have known something.</span> <span id="s657">But anyhow, I went into the ghetto and moved into these four ladies', into that ap...into that place.</span> <span id="s658">And a few days later, my farmer came with his two horses.</span> <span id="s659">By the way, he was the only individual farmer who had two horses and three cows.</span> <span id="s660">He was the richest farmer in that little village.</span> <span id="s661">The rest had only one horse, and sometimes a cow.</span> <span id="s662">But that was all.</span> <span id="s663">He came with his horses, with a sack full of potatoes and some lard.</span> <span id="s664">Somehow, I was alerted he was looking for me, and they found me.</span> <span id="s665">I came to the fence.</span> <span id="s666">He threw that over the wired...barb... barbed wire fence with the horses, and got away so that he wouldn't be caught.</span> <span id="s667">That's how loyal that man was to me.</span> <span id="s668">I mean, he could have forgotten about me after I walked out of the house; but it was a characteristic of that person.</span> <span id="s669">Then there were a few more razzias again.</span> <span id="s670">I don't have the English word for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q:"Roundup"?</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A:Roundups.</span> <span id="s673">And we always hid.</span> <span id="s674">On November the 4th, in the evening--no, on November the 4th--I went to visit in the other half of the ghetto with some friends.</span> <span id="s675">And somehow I missed the closing hour of the two ghetto doors.</span> <span id="s676">And it was past 8 o'clock, when they were closed for good until next morning.</span> <span id="s677">And they tell me there, "Why don't you stay here?</span> <span id="s678">Whether you sleep here on the floor or there, doesn't make any difference."</span> <span id="s679">I says, "No, I wanta go into my place."</span> <span id="s680">I came to the gate where there was no police on this side of that gate...ghetto gate.</span> <span id="s681">There was no police.</span> <span id="s682">And it was locked with a long chain.</span> <span id="s683">There was some leeway between the two halves.</span> <span id="s684">Also in the bottom, the corner was bitten out by dogs, and there was a little...of a ditch-like.</span> <span id="s685">And I crawled through.</span> <span id="s686">I came across the street, knocked on the gate the...on the other side.</span> <span id="s687">And they asked me who I am; and I says, "I live here.</span> <span id="s688">I forgot about the time, and I'm late.</span> <span id="s689">Let me in."</span> <span id="s690">And they let me in.</span> <span id="s691">And I came to Mrs. Weiner, to Miss [Frisch (ph)], who were their name was.</span> <span id="s692">And at ll o'clock, there was a knocking on the door.</span> <span id="s693">By the way, we slept in clothing with all, whatever, we had in a little satchel or rucksack, whatever it was.</span> <span id="s694">At ll o'clock somebody knocked at the door; and they told us that the last man, who had a permit to work in the...in the country as a saddler on another big estate, was brought in by police.</span> <span id="s695">Which was interpreted as a very bad omen.</span> <span id="s696">At 1 o'clock at night, we were alerted again to go down into a hiding place.</span> <span id="s697">The hiding place dated back long before the first World War, when the local people were sometimes using it to get protection during the times of pogroms.</span> <span id="s698">That part of Poland was Russia before 1918.</span> <span id="s699">You had to go into the regular basement; and in one room, there was a sand floor.</span> <span id="s700">At one of the walls where the sand floor was, there was a box hidden in the sand which was also full with sand.</span> <span id="s701">If you lifted that box, there was a shaft.</span> <span id="s702">You crawled down and then forward; and now you were beyond another wall into a secret room which was...which had also sand floor.</span> <span id="s703">So that if you walk in there, they wouldn't hear anything.</span> <span id="s704">And the last person took that sand box, put it in place; and since the room was half dark anyways, you couldn't see.</span> <span id="s705">You couldn't...if there would be traces even, you couldn't see.</span> <span id="s706">And that's where we went, some 20, 25 people.</span> <span id="s707">A nephew of Mr. Goldfarb's....</span> <span id="s708">By the way, in... with...with us were the two sons of Mr. Goldfarb, Mordicai and Abraham.</span> <span id="s709">They were both, I think, painters; or one was a black...a..</span> <span id="s710">.</span> <span id="s711">uh...locksmith, and the other one was a painter.</span> <span id="s712">A nephew of Mr. Goldfarb's--of the owner of that house, was a pretty sizeable house--wanted to come in there, too, with his baby.</span> <span id="s713">But they told him he couldn't come down; because if the baby starts to cry, he would give away all the other people.</span> <span id="s714">At 6 o'clock in the morning, we could hear the voice of one of the Judenrats--Kurt [Hirschmann (ph)] was his name--who yelled out--and we could hear it in.</span> <span id="s715">.</span> <span id="s716">in the basement--"Alles, Alle aus den Verstecken!"</span> <span id="s717">"All of you out of the hiding places."</span> <span id="s718">"Piaski wird judenrein!"</span> <span id="s719">"Piaski will be cleaned of Jews."</span> <span id="s720">We sat tight and quiet; and everything was alright, until maybe two, three hours later we could hear....</span> <span id="s721">By the way, where we were, there was an outlook in the room from where you crawled into that room.</span> <span id="s722">You could pull out from the inside a stone out of the wall and see what's going on.</span> <span id="s723">Three times the SS and the policemen came to look, and didn't find us.</span> <span id="s724">And suddenly we hear an ax working on that box.</span> <span id="s725">They pulled that box out.</span> <span id="s726">A Polish policeman crawled into that room, and he commandeered [NB: commanded] us to come out.</span> <span id="s727">And what actually happened: the fellow with the baby was found, and he gave us away out of...out of vengeance.</span> <span id="s728">Which actually saved me the life for the second time during 24 hours; because later on, I found out that those who didn't come out from their hiding places....</span> <span id="s729">And I would have been in the hiding place with the other people in the other half of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s730">They didn't come out.</span> <span id="s731">They didn't found them.</span> <span id="s732">But they bombed all these homes, and the basements were...uh....</span> <span id="s733">What you call it?</span> <span id="s734">Imploded-like, and the people died there in these basements.</span> <span id="s735">So if the guy wouldn't have given us away to the Germans, we would have been later on suffocating in that basement anyways.</span> <span id="s736">We came out, and we got a good beating; and were put into a huge mass of people who were already assembled and waiting in the big yard of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s737">The two sons of the Goldfarbs were in lead of that group with tied hands.</span> <span id="s738">And when we got in, our group--we were the last ones--we started our march toward Trawniki.</span> <span id="s739">That march was again horrible.</span> <span id="s740">The Germans...uh...mobilized some...in...in little villages, some farmers with their carriages where they loaded the sick and...and the half dead and those which they killed on the way, shot them on the way.</span> <span id="s741">They were all thrown on those carriages toward...on the way to Trawniki.</span> <span id="s742">I said to my... to ...to those ladies with who I walked, I says, "You know, it seems to me like we are walking on our own funeral."</span> <span id="s743">I got hit over the head by a Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s744">These were renegades of the Russian army who thought that they will have it better by the Germans; and they were used in this case, at least--as guards against Jews.</span> <span id="s745">I was hit with the butt of a..</span> <span id="s746">.</span> <span id="s747">of a..</span> <span id="s748">.</span> <span id="s749">uh... rifle in the head, and got a bad nose bleeding.</span> <span id="s750">We finally... well, it was raining all day, got to Trawniki.</span> <span id="s751">And there was another mass of people waiting from Izbica, another town where there was another ghetto.</span> <span id="s752">And they were squeezing them and forcing them into this cattle train; and then us.</span> <span id="s753">We finally were in the cattle train under whipping and hollering, and it...it was terrible.</span> <span id="s754">Squeezed like...like sardines.</span> <span id="s755">You couldn't turn around.</span> <span id="s756">And then the train started to move.</span> <span id="s757">We were glad that they closed the gates.</span> <span id="s758">And they put seals on them, and the train started to move.</span> <span id="s759">We didn't know where we are going.</span> <span id="s760">The train stopped quite a few times at night; but finally...finally around, I believe, 4 o'clock in the morning it stopped for good.</span> <span id="s761">(Sigh) We, of course, wondered where we were.</span> <span id="s762">And I crawled, or rather lifted myself, onto the small window of that....</span> <span id="s763">There were two windows on each side of that...of that train...of that car.</span> <span id="s764">And I saw some...in the darkness, some towers.</span> <span id="s765">And I said, and I assumed, that we were in a mine field, in a oil-mine field, where they...they have oil fields or oil towers, rigs.</span> <span id="s766">And that I would be...that we would be working there.</span> <span id="s767">That was my imagination.</span> <span id="s768">But by the way, I want to come back to the ghetto where there was a family that the man who was also a Judenrat.</span> <span id="s769">He was an engineer by profession and an expert in making fruit wine.</span> <span id="s770">One day the SS came in, and gave him orders with his wife to come with him...with them; and we only found out that he was taken out as an expert for fruit wines.</span> <span id="s771">With him lived also, as I assumed, one niece; but there were actually two of them, and there were no nieces.</span> <span id="s772">I got in touch with a lady in Israel only about a year ago who wanted some information from me on her rel...on her relative, a brother.</span> <span id="s773">And during corresponding with her, she told me that she knows of a people who were in Piaski in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s774">Their name is [Boehm (ph)], and they live in South America.</span> <span id="s775">I got the address, and I wrote to them whether they are that...that [Boehms (ph)], that engineer and his wife.</span> <span id="s776">And I got a letter back from her.</span> <span id="s777">I have it with me.</span> <span id="s778">The lady is over 80, and her husband just died.</span> <span id="s779">They were the only survivors from...not from, of Polish nationality, from the ghetto of Piaski.</span> <span id="s780">He worked in a plant making fruit wines for the SS.</span> <span id="s781">The girl who I thought is their niece happened to be in the same transport as they, and their family name was also [Boehm (ph)].</span> <span id="s782">And they took them with them.</span> <span id="s783">But they did not come out when he went in this new job.</span> <span id="s784">And one of them got shot on the cemetery in Piaski, and the other one she wrote me also where.</span> <span id="s785">So that is the story of the [Boehm (ph)] family, which is just a coincidence what happened to them and to me.</span> <span id="s786">And it came into my mind when I wanted to tell you that for two reasons it was good that I went into that other basement.</span> <span id="s787">Well, we arrived.</span> <span id="s788">And then... and then the train started to move a little bit again; and the gates opened around 6 o'clock.</span> <span id="s789">And we were commandeered [NB: commanded] out of the cars on a ramp, and from there we walked down.</span> <span id="s790">And as...what we saw was really very attractive.</span> <span id="s791">Little homes, little front gardens, nice little bushes.</span> <span id="s792">And girls looking out from these homes; and we were walking.</span> <span id="s793">And while we were walking in this complex, I noticed that these were not oil rigs--those towers.</span> <span id="s794">These were watch towers, with guards on top.</span> <span id="s795">As we walk, an SS man, whose name was--as I found out later--Herman Mischler [NB: Oberscharführer Hermann Michel], give us a speech.</span> <span id="s796">And he said, in German of course, "Which heartless mother left her little child in that car there and is not...is exposed to starvation?</span> <span id="s797">Isn't there another woman who would have a heart and take the child?"</span> <span id="s798">And Mrs. [Rotter (ph)] says to me, "Kurt, do you think I should go?"</span> <span id="s799">I says, "Go ahead."</span> <span id="s800">And she says, "I think if God saved me up to now, he will help me with that baby."</span> <span id="s801">She came back with a naked child, about a three-year old boy.</span> <span id="s802">It was very scared.</span> <span id="s803">But the woman who left it there--I found out later, too--figured nobody will notice the child.</span> <span id="s804">The train will move out.</span> <span id="s805">They'll find the child, and somebody will raise it.</span> <span id="s806">Well, anyhow, as soon as we got deep into the complex, we were separated by sexes.</span> <span id="s807">Children up to six went with their mothers, and boys older went with the men.</span> <span id="s808">Now, I could see in this big yard.</span> <span id="s809">There was a group of women on one side, and Mrs. [Rotter (ph)] with that little boy on her arms.</span> <span id="s810">And we were in another section.</span> <span id="s811">And then we were marched off....</span> <span id="s812">And by the way, Mrs. [Rotter (ph)] just moved her shoulders-- like asking me, "What's going on?"</span> <span id="s813">And I did the same thing: "I..</span> <span id="s814">.</span> <span id="s815">I don't know what's going on."</span> <span id="s816">Then the men were marched onto some kind of a big roof.</span> <span id="s817">I can't give you anymore description.</span> <span id="s818">But they were looking for artisans, and for certain experts.</span> <span id="s819">They took out shoemakers, I believe, tailors, electricians, glaziers--people who put panes into the window; and then they asked for textile experts.</span> <span id="s820">And I raised my hand, and this officer with an SD on his cap, which means "Sicherheitsdienst"--"Security Service"--says to me in a Viennese dialect, "[Von vos ans?</span> <span id="s821">(ph)]"--"Where do you come from?"</span> <span id="s822">And I says to him, "From Brünn--from Brno [NB: the first name is the German for Brno], the textile center of Moravia."</span> <span id="s823">And he motioned to me; says, "Komme raus."</span> <span id="s824">[Trans: "Come out."]</span> <span id="s825">I came out, and joined the other group of these other men.</span> <span id="s826">And we then--it was a group of approximately 50 people--were marched away into another enclosure.</span> <span id="s827">And there I have notice that one man with a whip was beating another young...little fellow.</span> <span id="s828">But I didn't know what was going on.</span> <span id="s829">And in this big yard, we were...we got coffee, bitter coffee, and I think some bread.</span> <span id="s830">And I was kind of walking around in that yard, and got in a corner where the...the fence, the barbed wire fence, was uh braided with coniferous wigs...uh, twigs.</span> <span id="s831">And I hear women cry...and yelling; and then when I look better I could see through.</span> <span id="s832">I saw silhouettes of naked women, running.</span> <span id="s833">In the meantime that fellow who beat the other fellow came to me with his whip; and he says, "Get out of here.</span> <span id="s834">It's not good to be nosey."</span> <span id="s835">So I left.</span> <span id="s836">Later on, I found out that he was beating the other fellow because he had the guts to go to some SS man and tell them that he would like to has his wife to help him, whatever he will be doing.</span> <span id="s837">And the SS man really got that woman out.</span> <span id="s838">That man's name was Jacob [Pertz (ph)].</span> <span id="s839">We called him "Mitzelmacher," which means he was making caps.</span> <span id="s840">That was his trade.</span> <span id="s841">His children went into the transport; but his wife got saved and she worked with the women, whatever their task was.</span> <span id="s842">Then at noontime, uh...groups came of laborers, and there was food served for them.</span> <span id="s843">They got soup, and I don't know what else.</span> <span id="s844">Potato soup I remember for sure.</span> <span id="s845">Yah.</span> <span id="s846">And in the evening we were getting, ten men, a loaf of bread and some marmalade, which is actually made of beets.</span> <span id="s847">But these groups of people who came in, after they ate they stand up in...they stood up in the formation.</span> <span id="s848">We, the newcomers, were put into these formations, 3 in...in across.</span> <span id="s849">Then they counted all of us, and we were led back to our stations, where to work.</span> <span id="s850">I landed as a textile expert in...in a place on the roof where there were piles of luggage.</span> <span id="s851">Suitcases.</span> <span id="s852">Bundles.</span> <span id="s853">Boxes.</span> <span id="s854">You name it.</span> <span id="s855">And our job was to sort these luggage by quality, but also by kind.</span> <span id="s856">For instance, shoes: ladies, mens, and children.</span> <span id="s857">Uh, Men's suits: again, jackets, pants and if there were vests.</span> <span id="s858">The task was following.</span> <span id="s859">First of all, we had to take off the star of David, if there was any; and empty all the pockets so that there would be nothing left in there.</span> <span id="s860">And we were told that there are three classes.</span> <span id="s861">Rags, used, and new.</span> <span id="s862">And we have to bundle slacks.</span> <span id="s863">I believe, 20 or 25 pair to a bundle.</span> <span id="s864">Jackets, I think, 10.</span> <span id="s865">The shoes were tied together.</span> <span id="s866">And on both sides of that place where we sorted and farther back, there were compartments built out of wooden poles with doors.</span> <span id="s867">And everything else was barbed wire.</span> <span id="s868">On the outside, were big blankets so that the rain and the snow couldn't come into these enclosures.</span> <span id="s869">And that was full of goods which was sorted while we did that.</span> <span id="s870">And that was after the victims actually who perished in Sobibór.</span> <span id="s871">In that same afternoon, I got a pair of pants--slacks--from a fellow who was in the transport, and his name was Josef [Albrecht (ph)].</span> <span id="s872">Not from Boskovice; but his wife came from Boskovice.</span> <span id="s873">And he came with her there, and came into the transport to Terezín, and later on.</span> <span id="s874">And I recognized the pants, because they had a rubber, an elastic-- pardon me--an elastic on the bottom, which his wife put in to protect him from the cold weather.</span> <span id="s875">That's...for that they needed textile experts.</span> <span id="s876">Uh, there I worked for awhile.</span> <span id="s877">For three days, I could not conceive what's going on.</span> <span id="s878">As a matter of fact, when this...which was a kapo....that man was a kapo who chased me away from that spot where I was.</span> <span id="s879">I walked away.</span> <span id="s880">I see a girl.</span> <span id="s881">Her name was Bertha Kollek.</span> <span id="s882">She came from a little town not far from Brno, and her father used to be the mayor of this little village.</span> <span id="s883">And what struck then later on, the mayor of Jerusalem is also Kollek, and I wonder whether these two Kolleks were related or not.</span> <span id="s884">Well, when I see Bertha...she worked among the ten Czech people on that estate [NB: in Siedliszczki].</span> <span id="s885">I says, "Bertha, what's going on here?"</span> <span id="s886">She says, "You should be glad that you are here, because the food is much better than where the other people went.</span> <span id="s887">And you will be working here, and you'll be all right."</span> <span id="s888">She arrived there a week before me.</span> <span id="s889">But...caught into another surrounding [NB: razzia]; and that time they took out a few women as laundress, and she was among them.</span> <span id="s890">And I questioned her farther, and she got tears in her eyes and run away.</span> <span id="s891">Well, it seeped through to me that actually what happened... the people, as they arrived, (sigh) they were sorted by sexes.</span> <span id="s892">They were told to undress, to tie their shoes; so that they wouldn't be mixed up when they go into the bath to be disinfected.</span> <span id="s893">And then they will get fresh clothing, and they will be going to some jobs.</span> <span id="s894">What actually happened when they...after they undressed, they chased them into the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s895">And that's what I have noticed with these women.</span> <span id="s896">And Mrs. [Rotter (ph)] went with that baby there, after the speech of the German [NB: Oberscharführer Hermann Michel] that there should be a woman with heart who would save the child.</span> <span id="s897">And that was the end of that transport.</span> <span id="s898">For three days, I couldn't grasp what was going on; until I realized that I'm in a factory of...in a death factory, where we are just as instruments being kept to work.</span> <span id="s899">For economic reasons.</span> <span id="s900">The whole was an economic enterprise.</span> <span id="s901">Next to the gas chamber, which was in Camp number 3, where we could never enter.</span> <span id="s902">Once you entered Camp number 3, you never got out.</span> <span id="s903">There was also a group of Jewish slave laborers who had to drag the dead people from the gas chamber; and in many cases, uh...taking out their dentures, the gold.</span> <span id="s904">And then either throw them onto a pyre.</span> <span id="s905">And if there was more...if there were more...more corpses than the capacity of burning, then they had a..</span> <span id="s906">.</span> <span id="s907">uh...earth moving machine there which dug deep trenches where they threw dead corpses, covered them up with soil.</span> <span id="s908">And when there were no transports coming in and they had an opportunity to burn these people, they undug these graves again, took them out and put them on the pyre and burned them.</span> <span id="s909">And the ashes were being loaded in barrels.</span> <span id="s910">I have seen some.</span> <span id="s911">You could even notice a little pieces of bone within the ashes.</span> <span id="s912">And that was sent to Germany as fertilizer.</span> <span id="s913">Uh, that went on all the time until when I escaped.</span> <span id="s914">But in the meantime, I noticed there were two groups of people.</span> <span id="s915">The one which looked pretty healthy yet, and the other one which were really emaciated.</span> <span id="s916">In the meantime, I..</span> <span id="s917">.</span> <span id="s918">they opened a little warehouse, which was not bigger than maybe three by three yards, with boxes full of small items--like brushes, wads of wool, fountain pens, pencils, you name it.</span> <span id="s919">Little, little items.</span> <span id="s920">And I got a job to work and sort the stuff in there.</span> <span id="s921">Together with another fellow, his name was [Alfred Friedburg (ph)]--from Frankfurt, or close by.</span> <span id="s922">He was a shoe expert.</span> <span id="s923">He worked in a shoe factory, and I think also prior to that in an umbrella factory.</span> <span id="s924">He was one of the real older people taken out from a transport, for.</span> <span id="s925">.</span> <span id="s926">for what reason I do not know.</span> <span id="s927">He must have been at that time in his 40s, or maybe 50s.</span> <span id="s928">We work in there, and I got smart right...right away; because I knew that we smuggled money in a brush.</span> <span id="s929">If you perhaps notice, there is the backside of the brush which hides that part where the...where the bristles are attached to the brush.</span> <span id="s930">We took these at home...at home apart, put money in there, and close it up again.</span> <span id="s931">I opened a brush or two, and there was money there, too.</span> <span id="s932">And we collected a lot of money.</span> <span id="s933">But the next day after we were there, or even the first day, a Ukrainian guard came in and he picked up a few pencils and a fountain pen.</span> <span id="s934">And the next day he brings us Polish kielbasa.</span> <span id="s935">This is a sausage; and a liter of vodka.</span> <span id="s936">And I don't know how it came to the amount, but I says, uh, "How much?"</span> <span id="s937">He says...somehow the amount of 800 zlotys came about--no, 800 marks.</span> <span id="s938">And we already had money from those brushes and from the wads of wool.</span> <span id="s939">We very often unwound some; and there was money in there, too.</span> <span id="s940">And I gave him 800 marks of the money which we were supposed to deliver to the Germans.</span> <span id="s941">And he brought us every second day, two pounds--one kilo--of sausage, and one liter of vodka.</span> <span id="s942">He worked with the horses; but he was only supervising the horses.</span> <span id="s943">Or rather, the laborer.</span> <span id="s944">The man who worked in...in the stable was Samuel Lerer.</span> <span id="s945">He owns today a limousine in New York.</span> <span id="s946">He got away.</span> <span id="s947">(Laughing) And...and I got acquainted with him very well.</span> <span id="s948">I know his wife, his children.</span> <span id="s949">Uh, so that's what it was until they closed up that warehouse.</span> <span id="s950">And I noticed that there were people who looked pretty good, and others who were, as I said, emaciated.</span> <span id="s951">And those were were emaciated they had...they lived on what they got from the Germans to eat, from the SS.</span> <span id="s952">By the way, these little homes which we noticed coming from that...from the ramp, were the quarters of the SS.</span> <span id="s953">And the girls who looked out were the Jewish girls who were cleaning up the rooms.</span> <span id="s954">And that was so deceiving to us, the whole thing.</span> <span id="s955">It was all figured out to the last crossing of a "T" how to deceive the people.</span> <span id="s956">And now I got back in the sorting department.</span> <span id="s957">In the meantime, I got sick.</span> <span id="s958">I got high fever and very...was very weak.</span> <span id="s959">And during a loading of a freight train--which was not on the ramp but beyond the ramp--we dragged these bundles of clothing from these compartments, from that warehouse actually, onto the train.</span> <span id="s960">And I was so weak that I hardly could make it.</span> <span id="s961">And an SS man, whose name was Kurt Richter, from Karlsbad.</span> <span id="s962">Maybe you heard that name even.</span> <span id="s963">This is a resort in Bohemia, western Bohemia--world famous.</span> <span id="s964">He pushed me in a latrine, I think, twice that day.</span> <span id="s965">Twice I crawled out, and somehow made it back into the barracks in the evening.</span> <span id="s966">And, uh, I got some help.</span> <span id="s967">This Bertha Kollek, she had somehow access to some extra food, and brought me a little bit.</span> <span id="s968">And my friend Chaim Engel, who also survived, helped me a little bit, I believe, at one time.</span> <span id="s969">I don't know where he got it, but he brought me a bottle of wine, I think.</span> <span id="s970">Anyhow, I made it.</span> <span id="s971">And in the meantime, transports were coming in so often.</span> <span id="s972">There was no schedule.</span> <span id="s973">They brought in a transport at night, a small transport, I remember at one time when I walked...went to get something.</span> <span id="s974">But that was already in the early fall; but I wouldn't like to forget it on that episode.</span> <span id="s975">While I was walking through the yard where the people undressed....</span> <span id="s976">And by the way, later on they built also a barracks where the women were put in.</span> <span id="s977">And there was a group of what they called barbers who went into that barracks and... and...uh...cut the hair of all the women before they went in to the gas.</span> <span id="s978">Even that was utilized; I think as mattress filler.</span> <span id="s979">I think so; for U-Boats, for submarines.</span> <span id="s980">Uh, I forgot my...my thought.</span> <span id="s981">I mean, I would have to wait a minute because I deviated now.</span> <span id="s982">(Pause) Would you tell me what I said?</span></p> <p><span id="s983">Q:You were talking about Chaim Engel.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">A:What?</span></p> <p><span id="s985">Q:Chaim Engel, your friend?</span></p> <p><span id="s986">A:Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s987">Uh, then later on I was still pretty weak and we were running in formation in the yard of the camp.</span> <span id="s988">And this one SS man, Oberscharführer Frenzel, had with him a St. Bernard dog.</span> <span id="s989">His name [NB: the dog] was Barry; and he [NB: Frenzel] chased the dog at those who couldn't run fast enough.</span> <span id="s990">And this dog bit me in my side here; but I had a lot of clothing on.</span> <span id="s991">I had a sweater, a jacket, and a top coat.</span> <span id="s992">And he didn't go...didn't go through.</span> <span id="s993">Then later on, I recuperated.</span> <span id="s994">And in the meantime I hear a rumor that the Germans want somebody to take care of the sick Jews.</span> <span id="s995">Up to then, whenever you were sick or you told them that you were sick, you couldn't do anything, they took you right away and they said, "You go into the Lazarett [NB: the infirmary in Camp 3]."</span> <span id="s996">They took you into Camp 3, and there you were shot and that was the end of you.</span> <span id="s997">But now for their own benefit, to have a small going--because we knew already exactly what to do and how to do it.</span> <span id="s998">And also they wanted to save, although they...they didn't have to necessarily have do that, but they were expert...trade experts.</span> <span id="s999">There were cobblers who made shoes to order, and boots.</span> <span id="s1000">There were tailors who made clothing to order.</span> <span id="s1001">There were goldsmiths.</span> <span id="s1002">There was a shop of over 30 carpenters who made beautiful furniture.</span> <span id="s1003">And the SS, who after 42 days of service went for 18 days on furloughs, and dragged every time anything they could get and ordered in the meantime from these shops.</span> <span id="s1004">All these shops were in the Camp of number 1...Camp number 1, where we also slept and where there was a kitchen; and in the center was a artisan [NB: artesian] well, where you pulled the water with a long rope...rod or pole.</span> <span id="s1005">On the end of which, there was a hook; and you let a wooden bucket go down there and then pulled the water up.</span> <span id="s1006">That was Camp number 1.</span> <span id="s1007">There were barracks for women and barracks for men.</span> <span id="s1008">I was in the camp, I believe, a few weeks.</span> <span id="s1009">I was...I was still kind of greenhorn.</span> <span id="s1010">I still worked in the sorting.</span> <span id="s1011">In the morning....</span> <span id="s1012">They...they counted us three times a day.</span> <span id="s1013">In the morning, there was an "Appell" and they counted us; and at noontime when we went back to work, and in the evening before we were get into the barracks to sleep, to find out whether there is anybody missing.</span> <span id="s1014">This one gray morning--I would say it was the end of November, maybe in December already--there were two men missing.</span> <span id="s1015">One's name was Miller.</span> <span id="s1016">I forgot the other one.</span> <span id="s1017">One of them was a carpenter, and the other one was a bricklayer.</span> <span id="s1018">One of the two, I don't know which one now, had a broken arm.</span> <span id="s1019">And this Scharführer Michel [NB: Oberscharführer Hermann Michel], who was a male nurse, actually fixed it for him.</span> <span id="s1020">Put it in a splice and bandaged it, so that he still could work somehow.</span> <span id="s1021">They were very important to them, because they were building something.</span> <span id="s1022">These two men, during a rainy night, dug a hole in the sandy ground under the fenced wires.</span> <span id="s1023">And in the morning they were gone.</span> <span id="s1024">So during the appell, Scharführer Frenzel [NB: Oberscharführer Karl Frenzel] noticed that two are missing; and he at random took, I believe, every 10th [NB: man] and he had 20 men now to be shot for the two who got away.</span> <span id="s1025">Somehow, after a while, another SS man came.</span> <span id="s1026">He was the second in command.</span> <span id="s1027">His name was "Johnny."</span> <span id="s1028">They called him "Johnny."</span> <span id="s1029">Johann Niemann [NB: SS Untersturmführer].</span> <span id="s1030">He came from Friesland, which is a border region in eastern [northwestern]Germany--between Holland, I believe, and...and Germany.</span> <span id="s1031">And he never spoke a word.</span> <span id="s1032">He had his nice little whip, always in gloves, perfectly dressed; and he walked so slow that you think...you thought he might lose his balance.</span> <span id="s1033">It was amazing how he walked.</span> <span id="s1034">And he goes to Frenzel, and they talk a little bit.</span> <span id="s1035">And they cut the amount of the 20 to be...to be shot, to ten.</span> <span id="s1036">And the ten people then were taken away.</span> <span id="s1037">Why Niemann cut it to ten, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1038">Nobody knew.</span> <span id="s1039">And we didn't know what kind of a person he was.</span> <span id="s1040">Allegedly, he was a nephew to the head of the SS, [Heinrich] Himmler.</span> <span id="s1041">Allegedly.</span> <span id="s1042">I don't know whether this was true or not.</span> <span id="s1043">But that was the first time anybody tried to escape at night; and it cost ten lives.</span> <span id="s1044">Uh, could you shut it off for a minute please?</span> <span id="s1045">I want to...I want to see here a few notes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">Q:You can just quickly pause.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">A:Okay.</span> <span id="s1048">I just don't want to use up the tape for nothing.</span> <span id="s1049">(Pause) Here...well, I forget to tell you, for instance, that when we were in the ghetto, it was...the last few days people were afraid to get even water from the other part of the ghetto; because they were constantly rounded up.</span> <span id="s1050">And we bribed other people to get us the water.</span> <span id="s1051">Not us.</span> <span id="s1052">We were in the same place [NB: as the water].</span> <span id="s1053">But those who came from the other side, they had to bribe people to get them...to get them the ghetto [NB: the water].</span> <span id="s1054">(Checking notes) Uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">Q:Uh, we....</span> <span id="s1056">Let's not worry about that.</span> <span id="s1057">Let's...let's get to Sobibór.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">A:I don't...but I, I don't want to forget anything which is characteristic and important.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">Q:The Sobibór story is very important, and that is what we really need you to be telling us about.</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">A:(Checking notes) Uh, the...what else?</span> <span id="s1061">What's going on there?</span> <span id="s1062">Yah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">Q:I'll tell you what you can do.</span> <span id="s1064">You can come back at the end and you can spend some time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">A:No.</span> <span id="s1066">No.</span> <span id="s1067">That's all right.</span> <span id="s1068">I remember now what I wanted to tell you.</span> <span id="s1069">There was a rumor that the Germans are looking for somebody who would take care of the sick.</span> <span id="s1070">And at that time already, one of the first transports from Holland, from a camp called Westerbork, were arriving.</span> <span id="s1071">Always on Thursday morning, or latest Friday.</span> <span id="s1072">Once a week, there came a transport of 60 cars of regular trains with 40 people in each car.</span> <span id="s1073">That is 2,400 people.</span> <span id="s1074">And that started somehow in early March, I believe, or mid-March [1943].</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">Q:Okay.</span> <span id="s1076">Where are we now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">A:In...in Sobibór.</span> <span id="s1078">And these people too, they arrived; and if they needed somebody they took him out.</span> <span id="s1079">And the rest went right away into the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s1080">I remember at one time they let some women sing Dutch songs, gave them postcards to write to whoever at home.</span> <span id="s1081">And after they did that, they went into the gas.</span> <span id="s1082">Now among the people who were taken out from one of the first transports from Holland was a Dr. Ninc and a Dr. Sabice...Soubice.</span> <span id="s1083">They were two M.D.s; and prior to that, there was in the camp a Dr. Broesler, a Polish Jew who was a dentist.</span> <span id="s1084">These three men told me that they heard that they will be looking for somebody to take care of the sick; and they would like me to take on the job.</span> <span id="s1085">And they will help me as much as they can; but they were not allowed to do anything for the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1086">Shortly afterwards, at the "Appell" in the evening, Frenzel asked for somebody who would be able to take care of the sick.</span> <span id="s1087">I raised my hand; and he says, "What is your name?"</span> <span id="s1088">And I says, "Kurt."</span> <span id="s1089">"And where did you...how did you acquire any knowledge?"</span> <span id="s1090">I says, "I was a medic in the Czechoslovak army."</span> <span id="s1091">Which was not true; but I needed some alibi, and he bought it.</span> <span id="s1092">He took...he told me I will be taking care of the sick; and the rule was, a Jew can be sick for three days.</span> <span id="s1093">If he is sick longer, I have to deliver him...I have to deliver that patient to them.</span> <span id="s1094">Tell them about it.</span> <span id="s1095">"Fine."</span> <span id="s1096">According to...knowing the...I would say, the mentality of the Germans, I immediately set up a little [card-a-take (ph)].</span> <span id="s1097">I don't know what you call it in German.</span> <span id="s1098">A little file system.</span> <span id="s1099">And I wrote down, "Barney so and so got sick on the 12th."</span> <span id="s1100">And when Barney wasn't right on the 15th, I tore that card up; and on the 16th, I wrote another one for 3 days.</span> <span id="s1101">Once in a while, they came to the barrack.</span> <span id="s1102">Sometimes they asked me how many sick.</span> <span id="s1103">I says, "14" or "9," whatever I had.</span> <span id="s1104">And in most cases, they didn't even check it.</span> <span id="s1105">But sometimes they went to the barracks, and I had to call the names and they had to answer.</span> <span id="s1106">So they knew these people are there.</span> <span id="s1107">That happened, I would say, during the whole time and I was there from November 6th [NB: 1942] until October the 14th [NB: 1943]...maybe it happened six times.</span> <span id="s1108">I don't know exactly.</span> <span id="s1109">Maybe five, maybe seven times.</span> <span id="s1110">Uh, on.</span> <span id="s1111">Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s1112">Now then, I got...I occupied now on Camp number 1 a little hut, a little buildng with a stove of Dutch tiles.</span> <span id="s1113">The thing was not larger than maybe four by four feet.</span> <span id="s1114">It was a little home which they disassembled, a log home, out in...in some village and brought back into the camp and assembled it there.</span> <span id="s1115">I don't know what was there before I was told to be in there and do my job in there.</span> <span id="s1116">There were also many other buildings in the camp.</span> <span id="s1117">Like, for instance, the administration building which is a real huge home--log house--which was disassembled and then assembled again in there, where the Germans had their administration.</span> <span id="s1118">Uh, then there were a few more where the artisans were.</span> <span id="s1119">The carpenters, and that's the...the people who worked with paints and with uh tools, they had barracks.</span> <span id="s1120">The carpenters had the last barracks.</span> <span id="s1121">There must have been over...quite over 30.</span> <span id="s1122">And the...the...the whole camp was actually a state in itself, because the SS had their jurisdiction.</span> <span id="s1123">They were...they were the judges, the executioners; and they did whatever they felt like doing to their own benefit.</span> <span id="s1124">And they were also interested into a smooth flow of the whole operation.</span> <span id="s1125">So, now I am...I am the medic who takes care of the sick.</span> <span id="s1126">And I protected the people.</span> <span id="s1127">I also was allowed to bring in from another warehouse--which was in Camp number 2, where the sorting was done--vaseline, cotton, and bandages.</span> <span id="s1128">I got very friendly with the fellow who worked there.</span> <span id="s1129">His name was Leon Halberstadt...Halberstam....</span> <span id="s1130">Halberstam, or Halberstadt.</span> <span id="s1131">I can't remember now.</span> <span id="s1132">Would have to look it up.</span> <span id="s1133">Uh...He brought me once in a while things which I was not allowed.</span> <span id="s1134">And I also smuggled in things.</span> <span id="s1135">I was allowed to go there every second day, and took other things, too, which I was not allowed.</span> <span id="s1136">And I want to tell you a very interesting story.</span> <span id="s1137">One day I have my little satchel with the stuff over my back, and I walked from Camp 1 into back Camp...from Camp 2 into back Camp 1...back into Camp 1.</span> <span id="s1138">And I was thinking, "What would you say if Gustav Wagner [NB: SS Oberscharführer]"--who was the roughest of them all and very cunning and very smart--"if you would now meet him, what would you tell him?"</span> <span id="s1139">And as soon as I finish the...that thought, I can hear him in the back.</span> <span id="s1140">"Kurt!"</span> <span id="s1141">And I turned around.</span> <span id="s1142">"Yes, Scharführer!"</span> <span id="s1143">"What do you have in there?"</span> <span id="s1144">And I says, "Cotton."</span> <span id="s1145">And he says, "And?"</span> <span id="s1146">And I says, "Bandages."</span> <span id="s1147">"And?"</span> <span id="s1148">"Iodine."</span> <span id="s1149">"And?"</span> <span id="s1150">"Aspirin."</span> <span id="s1151">And in the meantime, as we walked we come into Camp number 1 and he says, "Spread it."</span> <span id="s1152">There was a table on two posts with a board across, and two benches.</span> <span id="s1153">I poured the whole thing out.</span> <span id="s1154">And there was a box with cotton.</span> <span id="s1155">And he had an steel rod with which he walked.</span> <span id="s1156">And he pushes the thing around; and hits that table, that the objects which were there, they virtually jumped up.</span> <span id="s1157">And he said to me in German, "Du bist schweinkopf."</span> <span id="s1158">That means, "You were lucky."</span> <span id="s1159">That is a German idiom.</span> <span id="s1160">He was an Austrian.</span> <span id="s1161">And he walks away.</span> <span id="s1162">And if he would have opened that one box with the cotton, he would have found there a box...a can of sardines.</span> <span id="s1163">And I wouldn't be here today if he would have found that.</span> <span id="s1164">That was really another lucky coincidence.</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">Q:You know I think this a good place to stop.</span> <span id="s1166">We have to change the tapes again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">A:Okay.</span> <span id="s1168">Is it already an hour?</span> <span id="s1169">Okay.</span> <span id="s1170">Okay.</span> <span id="s1171">Change it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">Q:We have seven more minutes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">A:We do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Q:Oh, I thought you said four minutes to go.</span> <span id="s1175">Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">A:Hold on.</span> <span id="s1177">I have to see where I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">Q:We have time for one more story, then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">A:Yeah.</span> <span id="s1180">Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s1181">When I was in the camp, one day I asked for permission whether I may get a coat out of the new warehouse.</span> <span id="s1182">And there I found--and this SS man, one of the nice ones, says, "Go ahead."</span> <span id="s1183">I walk in there, and there was my new winter coat which my father took along from the ghetto!</span> <span id="s1184">It was amazing.</span> <span id="s1185">So now I knew.</span> <span id="s1186">They left on the 22nd.</span> <span id="s1187">The routine was: gas on the 23rd.</span> <span id="s1188">And when I think of my sister and my parents going into that gas, and the terror and the dehuman...dehumanation [NB: dehumanization]....</span> <span id="s1189">It's just terrible.</span> <span id="s1190">It's very hard to explain it.</span> <span id="s1191">I knew, on the 23rd I have, according to the Jewish religion, "Yahrzeit."</span> <span id="s1192">That means you light a candle on the day of the death, the demise of whoever your relatives were.</span> <span id="s1193">That's what I found in.</span> <span id="s1194">.</span> <span id="s1195">in that warehouse.</span> <span id="s1196">My...my rain...my raincoat, my new winter coat.</span> <span id="s1197">Uh...There was another thing which was very interesting.</span> <span id="s1198">There was a girl with who I got acquainted from Holland.</span> <span id="s1199">Her name was Minnie Katz, spelled with a K though.</span> <span id="s1200">From Haarlem, in Holland.</span> <span id="s1201">That girl, she spoke Dutch, German, French and English.</span> <span id="s1202">Very educated and very, very fine person.</span> <span id="s1203">One day she comes to me, and she says, "You know, Kurt, I found some money today."</span> <span id="s1204">I says, "What did you found?"</span> <span id="s1205">She says, "Dollars."</span> <span id="s1206">I says, "How much?"</span> <span id="s1207">She says, "Two thousand dollars."</span> <span id="s1208">"Where did you find it?"</span> <span id="s1209">"In a pot, in luggage."</span> <span id="s1210">There was a pot tied up with some rope on top, with paper; and when she opened it up, there was that money.</span> <span id="s1211">I says, "What did you do with the money?"</span> <span id="s1212">She says, "I threw it in the latrine."</span> <span id="s1213">Now, I didn't want to tell her, "If you find money, bring it to me."</span> <span id="s1214">Because I had channels where the Ukrainians, who you could bribe, brought you stuff.</span> <span id="s1215">But this is what happened once in awhile.</span> <span id="s1216">Uh, what else happened in the camp?</span> <span id="s1217">Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s1218">Once...once in awhile the SS men came, usually Frenzel, and asked me for the sick and took them away.</span> <span id="s1219">And we never saw them again.</span> <span id="s1220">They were shot.</span> <span id="s1221">But on November the...on, uh, November the...October the 14....</span> <span id="s1222">On October the llth--I think it was a Monday--he came, and he wants to see the sick.</span> <span id="s1223">And I had 14 of them at that time.</span> <span id="s1224">One fellow whose name was Federgrün who had frozen off toes, he couldn't walk.</span> <span id="s1225">Because if you lose your toes, you lose your balance.</span> <span id="s1226">And he [NB: Federgrün] was in there, too; and he [NB: Frenzel] took them away, and he recognized a few who he saw during the last inspection.</span> <span id="s1227">And he knew that I was cheating.</span> <span id="s1228">And as he takes them away, he says to me, "Du kommst nächst!"</span> <span id="s1229">And he raised Hell.</span> <span id="s1230">"You will be next!"</span> <span id="s1231">I don't know why he didn't take me at that time, to make number 15 out of the 14.</span> <span id="s1232">That was on a Monday.</span> <span id="s1233">Tuesday, he sees me running across the yard; and with his whip he motions to me.</span> <span id="s1234">"You just run.</span> <span id="s1235">I'll get you anyways."</span> <span id="s1236">That was another warning.</span> <span id="s1237">The following day, it was already organized to start with the uprising, which didn't happen on the 13th.</span> <span id="s1238">It was postponed by the 14th.</span> <span id="s1239">But that I will tell you on the other tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">Q:You're absolutely right.</span> <span id="s1241">Good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">TAPE #3</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">Q:Okay.</span> <span id="s1245">We're on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">A:During the winter of 1943, which was a very severe winter...</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">Q:You're going back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s1249">Uh, we experienced a visit of the head of the SS, [Heinrich] Himmler.</span> <span id="s1250">Uh, I remember seeing him in...with a group of the...the SS people who were in the camp constantly.</span> <span id="s1251">And uh...he had...he was a short fellow with dark glasses, dark rimmed glasses.</span> <span id="s1252">Very nice uniform.</span> <span id="s1253">He arrived in a..</span> <span id="s1254">.</span> <span id="s1255">in an armored train, and he...he left the same day.</span> <span id="s1256">But the day after he left, the Jewish cook--whose name was [Johanna Koch (ph)], she too came from Frankfurt, just like [Friedburg (ph)]--was dismissed; because he told them probably that a Jew cannot cook for them, because there's an opportunity to poison all of them, you know.</span> <span id="s1257">So I don't know who replaced her; but that was one of the things which I forgot about the camp.</span> <span id="s1258">Another one was, I had been hiding all those months two people: one was Josef Siegel, and the other one was Kiewe Herz.</span> <span id="s1259">Two inmates who had difficulties walking, because they too had frozen off toes.</span> <span id="s1260">And whenever we were counted during the formation time, they were in formation and they counted them.</span> <span id="s1261">And as soon as it was over and the groups marched away, they disappeared in the barracks.</span> <span id="s1262">And I kept them there for a month.</span> <span id="s1263">As a matter of fact, Josef Siegel got out of the camp, but he didn't make it later on.</span> <span id="s1264">Kiewe, I don't know whether he made it.</span> <span id="s1265">So one day we are in the barracks, and I checked with him down there; and Kiewe brings a couple of roasted chicken.</span> <span id="s1266">And, uh, I says, "Kiewe, where did you get those chicken?"</span> <span id="s1267">We started to eat them.</span> <span id="s1268">He says, "I found some money."</span> <span id="s1269">I says, "Where did you find the money?"</span> <span id="s1270">He says, "Here in that post, there's a hole in.</span> <span id="s1271">There was a few hundred dollars in there."</span> <span id="s1272">When Frenzel took away my last 14 patients--no, at another time.</span> <span id="s1273">I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s1274">That was prior to that.</span> <span id="s1275">When Frenzel took away at one time a group of people, I think at that time there were 11, among them was the fellow Federgrün.</span> <span id="s1276">I made a mistake there.</span> <span id="s1277">He whispered to me, "Where is messer is, is die gelt."</span> <span id="s1278">That means, "where the knife is, there's the money."</span> <span id="s1279">When he marched away with these, I believe, eleven...eleven men and had them killed right in Camp 3, I went back where Federgrün slept.</span> <span id="s1280">He slept on the first tier of the three tier high...uh....</span> <span id="s1281">Whatever call them?</span> <span id="s1282">Lodgings.</span> <span id="s1283">And above him, there was a knife in...in the board above him.</span> <span id="s1284">And I pulled the knife out and pried away; and there was a few hundred dollars there.</span> <span id="s1285">I didn't say anything to anybody.</span> <span id="s1286">I put them in the place where I slept.</span> <span id="s1287">There was a hollow in the post, and I slept on the highest berth.</span> <span id="s1288">Put it in there.</span> <span id="s1289">Kiewe found that money; and he bought the chicken, smuggled through an Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s1290">And then (laughing) actually that...that money legally would have belonged to me; but I didn't tell him it was my money because there was no...no need.</span> <span id="s1291">But that...that's how I ate.</span> <span id="s1292">.</span> <span id="s1293">ate at one time chicken in the camp.</span> <span id="s1294">These are unbelievable things which...which can happen.</span> <span id="s1295">Well, anyhow, eighteen days before October the 14th.</span> <span id="s1296">Oh, yet I wanta came back to Westerbork.</span> <span id="s1297">Out of Holland, we got approximately 15 transports, each with 2400 people.</span> <span id="s1298">They were coming in from March until, I believe, into May [1943].</span> <span id="s1299">Either on Thursday morning or Friday morning.</span> <span id="s1300">And they were also.</span> <span id="s1301">.</span> <span id="s1302">there was also a transport from France; and from Belgium, I think.</span> <span id="s1303">Uh, and these people, of course, the same thing happened to them what...what to the rest.</span> <span id="s1304">But there was a group of people which was called "Waldkommando."</span> <span id="s1305">That means "forest kommmando."</span> <span id="s1306">There was a group of um 72 men--no, there was a group of maybe 30 men--who went every morning out with couple of horses with a carriage.</span> <span id="s1307">And they were felling trees, cutting trees down in...in the forest; and brought them back as fuel into the camp under the auspices of a couple Ukrainians and an SS man.</span> <span id="s1308">By the way, the SS kept four horses in the camp.</span> <span id="s1309">Very often, they let some of the people crawl up the tree with a rope to tie it on top, so that they can pull it down then.</span> <span id="s1310">And many times they pulled the tree down before the man came down, and he got badly injured.</span> <span id="s1311">And in the end, I kept him for a few days; but there was...it was just horrible.</span> <span id="s1312">They went to death.</span> <span id="s1313">Uh, one day, we...at the evening Appell, there came an SS man--I think it was Gomerski [NB: SS Oberscharführer Hubert Gomerski]--with a few Ukrainians with automatic guns.</span> <span id="s1314">And Frenzel gave the order all Dutch men to come out from the formation.</span> <span id="s1315">There were 72 of them.</span> <span id="s1316">And he looked them over; and there was one whose name was Max Van Dam, an academic painter.</span> <span id="s1317">And he says, "Maler, komme raus."</span> <span id="s1318">--"Painter, come out."</span> <span id="s1319">He [NB: Van Dam] was just about working on his [NB: Frenzel's] portrait.</span> <span id="s1320">The rest of the 72 were marched away...marched away, and...and....</span> <span id="s1321">What do you call it?</span> <span id="s1322">In...on the double, and were shot.</span> <span id="s1323">We found out later than somebody either told them, or they assumed, that the Dutch are organizing an uprising.</span> <span id="s1324">And that was the result of either rumor or the giving away by somebody else who wanted to ingratiate themselves to the Germans.</span> <span id="s1325">That was that case.</span> <span id="s1326">Then another very important incidents.</span> <span id="s1327">The original Kapo when I arrived was a Moshe [Sturm (ph)], and there were under him a few other Kapos.</span> <span id="s1328">Among them there was a fellow, they called him "[Bunya (ph)]."</span> <span id="s1329">His name was Benjamin Katz.</span> <span id="s1330">And then there was another one, whose name was...you are...I'm smiling, because you're wondering that I remembered the names.</span> <span id="s1331">But I remember.</span> <span id="s1332">There was another one who...who we called "[Rejwiczer (ph)] ."</span> <span id="s1333">He was a young kid, maybe 18, 19 years old.</span> <span id="s1334">And they all had whips.</span> <span id="s1335">The [Rejwiczer (ph)]'s name was Herbert [Siegel (ph)].</span> <span id="s1336">And the name "[Rejwiczer (ph)]," he get from the local people--from the Polish Jews--because he came from the little town of Rejowiec.</span> <span id="s1337">So they called him [Rejwiczer (ph)].</span> <span id="s1338">These three men, one Sunday, got hold of some vodka, got a little drunk, and caused a tremendous upheaval in the camp.</span> <span id="s1339">On Sundays, we didn't work.</span> <span id="s1340">And they also were talking about escaping, running away.</span> <span id="s1341">On Monday, I think at noontime--yah, I think at noontime--Scharführer Frenzel came and took these three men away, and they were shot.</span> <span id="s1342">And he nominated immediately another Kapo, and maybe some other Kapos.</span> <span id="s1343">But I remember only the one who he nominated to be the head Kapo.</span> <span id="s1344">He called himself "Berliner."</span> <span id="s1345">He came from Berlin.</span> <span id="s1346">His name were Herbert [Naftanya (ph)], of Polish parentage.</span> <span id="s1347">He talked a perfect Jewish; which I did not.</span> <span id="s1348">I talked only Czech and German.</span> <span id="s1349">And he was very happy that he got that job.</span> <span id="s1350">But somebody saw him entering that day the administration building, and he told them what these three guys wanted to do.</span> <span id="s1351">And that was the end of their lives; and he became now the Kapo, the main Kapo.</span> <span id="s1352">But he was really miserable.</span> <span id="s1353">Miserable, nasty person!</span> <span id="s1354">One day, while we stood in formation while the SS came to take us away, he said, "I take you all into Camp 3."</span> <span id="s1355">That is the...in German, that is the gas chamber camp.</span> <span id="s1356">"And I alone will see Berlin after the war."</span> <span id="s1357">And that did it.</span> <span id="s1358">There was a fellow whose name was Shlomo Szmajzner, and I'm telling you only what I put together and what I heard.</span> <span id="s1359">I didn't talk to Shlomo about this.</span> <span id="s1360">He got a hold of a lot of money, put them in a pair of socks, went to Oberscharführer Frenzel, gave him those socks and started to complain about the Berliner.</span> <span id="s1361">I don't know what story he made up.</span> <span id="s1362">At the next "Appell," Frenzel raised Hell with the Berliner, and told him to lie down on the bench which he had to bring.</span> <span id="s1363">I was on that bench one time, too.</span> <span id="s1364">I got 25 [NB: lashes] myself.</span> <span id="s1365">But he got at least, maybe, a hundred whips from Frenzel and from other Kapos.</span> <span id="s1366">He really got it good.</span> <span id="s1367">And then he got exhausted and sick and tired and beaten up into the...into the barracks.</span> <span id="s1368">And a couple of days later, he was dead.</span> <span id="s1369">And as he was...he was carried out on a blanket, wherever they passed other people they spit on his body.</span> <span id="s1370">That was the end of the Berliner.</span> <span id="s1371">And they named...nominated another fellow--his name was Spitz, S-P-I-T-Z--from Vienna, who was a real decent guy.</span> <span id="s1372">Now the difference between [Sturm (ph)], who used his whip excessively anyways, and... and, uh, Berliner was that [Sturm (ph)] would never denounce you to a German.</span> <span id="s1373">He was the big shot, but he never would do that.</span> <span id="s1374">And he had deep down a feeling.</span> <span id="s1375">But to keep on top and to save his own he...he did pretty eratic things.</span> <span id="s1376">He hit me at one time with a pole with which the water was pulled out of it...uh...where the water was...the...the....uh...the source of the water [NB: the well].</span> <span id="s1377">And there was a long pole with...he took that pole one time--I don't know why--and he hit me over the shoulder that it broke.</span> <span id="s1378">The thing was at least that thick.</span> <span id="s1379">Broke on my shoulder, and for a few days I could hardly move my arm.</span> <span id="s1380">But then we were again with good friends.</span> <span id="s1381">I mean, he...he was just...you couldn't figure him out.</span> <span id="s1382">That was the difference between the Berliner, who was really a traitor to his own people of the worse kind, as [Sturm (ph)].</span> <span id="s1383">As...as you can see, nobody complained about him, that he wanted to run away.</span> <span id="s1384">But this one guy, he did.</span> <span id="s1385">It was...he probably said that he will be promoted.</span> <span id="s1386">Well, anyhow, Spitz was a guy who had no energy.</span> <span id="s1387">He just walked around among the laborers; and...uh...uh...only he was not too long--maybe six, eight weeks--the...the main Kapo.</span> <span id="s1388">So in the meantime, after all the Dutch transports came in, and other transports, one evening--no, one afternoon--I walked to get something from Camp 2.</span> <span id="s1389">And there is--in the morning, and there is a little pile of clothing.</span> <span id="s1390">And on top of the clothing, there is...there are two photographs.</span> <span id="s1391">Uh, pretty big ones.</span> <span id="s1392">A wedding picture of my boss's daughter, Ilse, and her husband, [Siegfried Lüfbehr (ph)].</span> <span id="s1393">And the second picture was the wife...Ilse's two other sisters, Ruth and Lydia [Brill (ph)].</span> <span id="s1394">So I looked at the pictures.</span> <span id="s1395">I don't remember whether I took them or not; but anyhow I knew that that night, these four people came into the camp.</span> <span id="s1396">And that was...that was end.</span> <span id="s1397">What else can I tell you about what happened in the...in the camp, it was...what of interest.</span> <span id="s1398">The picture, the situation....</span> <span id="s1399">Well, at the end of summer--no, it was later than end of summer.</span> <span id="s1400">It was the end of September [1943].</span> <span id="s1401">A few more transports came.</span> <span id="s1402">One was big.</span> <span id="s1403">There were some Czech people in it.</span> <span id="s1404">But they came from, I think, from Bia_ystok-- from a city deeper in...in the territory, east...east from us.</span> <span id="s1405">Among them was a fellow whose name I remember.</span> <span id="s1406">A Czech named [Stranski (ph)]; and this Otto Sander, who was a young kid.</span> <span id="s1407">And I was walking ambulantly in that little hut; and when the Russians came in, I--a group of uh...I don't know, maybe 60, 80 people--they had some spunk in them.</span> <span id="s1408">They were not terrorized.</span> <span id="s1409">They knew that the Germans can...can be beaten.</span> <span id="s1410">And whenever they...they march in their own formation.</span> <span id="s1411">They used them for...I don't know anymore what they did.</span> <span id="s1412">They were singing Russian songs.</span> <span id="s1413">And it's beautiful how they sang, the Russian songs.</span> <span id="s1414">And they right away started to figure out to get away.</span> <span id="s1415">Now we knew that the German front is coming closer.</span> <span id="s1416">At that time, I would say there may be 400 kilometers from our camp; because we found in the sorting room a little radio which they smuggled into a barn.</span> <span id="s1417">And there was an electrician from Germany--his name was Schwartz...Schwartz--who strung an antenna; and now they were listening during working hours in that barn while somebody was always watching there are nobody's coming in, what was going on.</span> <span id="s1418">And we knew from these news that the German front is coming closer and closer.</span> <span id="s1419">And we have two choices: to wait until they come close and then we will be liquidated--as it happened to some other people from camps who were workers in other camps and they liquidated in our camp; or get away.</span> <span id="s1420">And there was already some talk among the old timers and when the Russians came, the thing ripened.</span> <span id="s1421">There was a Russian officer--his name was Sasha Pechersky, Alexander Pechersky--who...who laid out the plan, how to do it.</span> <span id="s1422">I was approached by Feldhendler, who was one of the senior...I would say elders, whether I would also like to come into the committee and whatever, prepare for this.</span> <span id="s1423">And I says to him, "I'll tell you something.</span> <span id="s1424">I will help as much as I can, but I do not want to be involved in any meetings."</span> <span id="s1425">And the reason was, I..</span> <span id="s1426">.</span> <span id="s1427">I just felt that I'm more secure the way I am; and I'm doing plenty for the other people.</span> <span id="s1428">As a matter of fact, up to that point I was the only one who risked my own life for the benefit of whatever I could do....</span> <span id="s1429">Well, for those who claimed to be sick, or were sick.</span> <span id="s1430">Well, the plan was to kill the SS in individual spots.</span> <span id="s1431">Because they used to come to pick up their boots, their clothing, whatever.</span> <span id="s1432">And, uh, there was one took care of...who was a supervisor in the...with the horses, and so forth.</span> <span id="s1433">That was the plan; and then we would get...to get the...the room where there were the weapons--the armory--and arm ourselves, and walk out from the camp like an armed unit.</span> <span id="s1434">Of course, it didn't work out that way.</span> <span id="s1435">On that...on the 13th...on the 12th of October, the women who worked in Camp number 4 where they were sorting and cleaning ammunition which was brought in from the front.</span> <span id="s1436">And it was ammunition from...from Russia.</span> <span id="s1437">They were supposed to bring in a few hand grenades; but they got afraid, and among those women who were supposed to do that was the wife of Jacob [Pertz (ph)], the man who we called "Mitzelmacher."</span> <span id="s1438">They didn't bring it.</span> <span id="s1439">So we postponed the uprising from the 12th to the 13th.</span> <span id="s1440">And on the 13th, they were to bring it again; and they didn't again.</span> <span id="s1441">So the decision was made, we have to do with...tomorrow, like on the 14th; because on the 15th, Wagner was coming back from his...from his furlough, and with him around it would be much more difficult.</span> <span id="s1442">Around 2 o'clock in the afternoon, I was told by one of the people who were...who were on the committee, or whatever you want you to call it.</span> <span id="s1443">I really don't know how it was organized, and I didn't want to know.</span> <span id="s1444">But I was told to watch Spitz, who was the top Kapo; so that he...if he sees something not going the way it should, wouldn't go and report.</span> <span id="s1445">Personally, I didn't feel that it was necessary, because he was an honest man and he was a good man and he wouldn't have done it.</span> <span id="s1446">But I kept company with him until about 3:30 or so.</span> <span id="s1447">And then I let him go, and went back in my little hut.</span> <span id="s1448">And...uh...in came Leon Friedman, who had two professions.</span> <span id="s1449">He was a young strappy fellow.</span> <span id="s1450">He was shoemaker, a cobbler; and a electrician.</span> <span id="s1451">I think he came from either Warsaw or _ód_.</span> <span id="s1452">And he, at one time, had a big boil in his groin.</span> <span id="s1453">When the groin...he couldn't walk anymore then, and I let him lie on his...on his berth in the barracks.</span> <span id="s1454">And when it was ripe to be open, I got from...from the barracks anesthesia in...like a spray can.</span> <span id="s1455">And I sprayed it and killed it, opened the thing, got all the...the...that uh....</span> <span id="s1456">What you call it?</span> <span id="s1457">Pus, out; and gave him some bandages.</span> <span id="s1458">In a couple of days, he was down on his feet.</span> <span id="s1459">When the day came of the uprising....</span> <span id="s1460">No, from then on he was bringing me gold coins, which he as a shoeman, as a shoe expert, was finding in the heels of some shoes.</span> <span id="s1461">And he just brought me today two and then two days later three, whatever.</span> <span id="s1462">And I was putting them in a jar, and buried in...in the sand behind the...one of the barracks.</span> <span id="s1463">On the day of the uprising--no, a day before--I took a spade, the jar out of the ground, and put it in that little oven which was in the hut where I worked.</span> <span id="s1464">By the way, with me at that time was also a Russian, one of the Russian, uh, soldiers.</span> <span id="s1465">These...these were POWs who were brought in the camp--a fellow who was a barber; but he wasn't with there...with me there at daytime.</span> <span id="s1466">At daytime he had another job.</span> <span id="s1467">Then after 6 when they...when the work was finished, he shaved those who wanted to be shaved in that same place.</span> <span id="s1468">Well, on that afternoon around 3:30, Leon Friedman comes into my hut; and I pull out the jar.</span> <span id="s1469">"One to you, and one to me;" and we divided that money.</span> <span id="s1470">And I put mine in a sock.</span> <span id="s1471">I put it in my pocket.</span> <span id="s1472">He put it in his pocket.</span> <span id="s1473">And he came with cleats.</span> <span id="s1474">He was very upset, very nervous.</span> <span id="s1475">I says, "Leon, you have a job to do.</span> <span id="s1476">Gather yourself, and do it now."</span> <span id="s1477">And he kissed me very fervently; and he walked out to that pole...uh...which there wires on, and he put the cleats on....</span> <span id="s1478">I think he put the cleats on in the room where I was there.</span> <span id="s1479">And he walked there, got to the pole, put his belt around the pole, and started to climb up the pole; and cut the telephone wires, so the SS wouldn't have any communication with the outside.</span> <span id="s1480">That was his job.</span> <span id="s1481">Where he went, what happened to him, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1482">The last time I saw him going up on that pole.</span> <span id="s1483">Then uh a little while...I mean, a little while later...in the next or so, individual laborers who somehow could get away were gathering in...in Camp number 1, where they were not supposed to be at that time yet.</span> <span id="s1484">Because they were supposed to come when the day was over at 5 o'clock, or whatever in wintertime, together with the whole group.</span> <span id="s1485">And there was an accumulation of people--maybe 50, 60.</span> <span id="s1486">Mostly young people.</span> <span id="s1487">Suddenly, a Ukrainian comes on a bicycle.</span> <span id="s1488">He was what...what we call "Volksdeutscher."</span> <span id="s1489">He was actually of German heritage--son of some probably German farmers, who came under the Czars as a farmer...as a..</span> <span id="s1490">.</span> <span id="s1491">he was a child--or rather, an ancestor--of these farmers, but they still spoke a bad German among themselves.</span> <span id="s1492">His name was Alex Kaiser.</span> <span id="s1493">He come on a bike into the camp through the gate; and as soon as he entered the gate and got deep enough, a group of young boys went at him and stabbed him to death.</span> <span id="s1494">The bike was lying there, and he was lying here.</span> <span id="s1495">And there were two barracks close to each other.</span> <span id="s1496">And I look and see that there is a guard on the tower which could have seen what's happening, but somehow he probably did not.</span> <span id="s1497">And I dragged this man with another fellow--I don't know who the other man was--between those two barracks.</span> <span id="s1498">So nobody would see that he's dead, and what happened to him.</span> <span id="s1499">I had blood on my hands, human blood; it was very, very horrible...uh... feeling for me.</span> <span id="s1500">Anyhow, more people came; and prior to that there was a real eerie quiet in that whole big yard on which there were about six or eight barracks, the kitchen and all these shops.</span> <span id="s1501">And there I see Shlomo Szmajzner running diagonally from one corner of the yard into his shop, with something wrapped in a blanket.</span> <span id="s1502">And then these people were coming into the yard.</span> <span id="s1503">Well, anyhow...by 4, 4:40 or 4:50 or so, the carpenters' job was to come out from their shop and storm the armory.</span> <span id="s1504">Oh, yeah; but prior to that the following happened: at 4 o'clock, Untersturmführer Niemann had an appointment to fit a suit.</span> <span id="s1505">Exactly 4 o'clock.</span> <span id="s1506">And as I explained before, he came on a horse.</span> <span id="s1507">The horse's name was Tsili.</span> <span id="s1508">A brown mare.</span> <span id="s1509">Her name was Tsili.</span> <span id="s1510">There were four horses; but I remember Tsili, and I think there was another one, Ima.</span> <span id="s1511">And he gets off the horse.</span> <span id="s1512">And right to the gate, there was also a bakery and the baker's name was Israel.</span> <span id="s1513">We called him "Srulek the baker."</span> <span id="s1514">And he [NB: Niemann] says to the baker, who looked out, "Baker, hold the...keep the horse."</span> <span id="s1515">And Srulek took the horse, and he's holding the horse.</span> <span id="s1516">And he [NB: Niemann] walks just as slow as ever, with his hand on the back, and his whip; and enters the...the tailor shop.</span> <span id="s1517">And as soon as he entered, they must have hit over the head and that was the end of Niemann.</span> <span id="s1518">And Srulek knew that he wouldn't come out anymore; and as soon as he opened that door, he hit the horse on the rump and the horse turned around and run out of the yard and back to its stable, wherever it was.</span> <span id="s1519">That was the only SS man I have seen walking to his death.</span> <span id="s1520">But altogether, I think 11 were killed.</span> <span id="s1521">Now...now then...then comes the carpenters.</span> <span id="s1522">Kaiser was already dead.</span> <span id="s1523">And the carpenters go to the fence and try to storm it.</span> <span id="s1524">And a salvo came from the other yard, where the Germans lived and where was the main entrance.</span> <span id="s1525">There came a salvo of machine fire, machine gun fire.</span> <span id="s1526">How they knew or why they did it, I do not know; and I don't know whether anybody knows, or ever knew.</span> <span id="s1527">They got scared and retreated.</span> <span id="s1528">And I was behind them, and I says, "Bridder, noch a mol!"</span> <span id="s1529">And I guided them, "Brothers, once more!"</span> <span id="s1530">And they tried once more, together with the other crowd; but another salvo came, and the fences were too solid anyways.</span> <span id="s1531">Behind the fence a few yards farther, there was the armory, where we wanted actually to get the weapons.</span> <span id="s1532">And they turned around and ran along all these shops to the fence.</span> <span id="s1533">In the corner between the last shop--the carpenter's shop--and the fence, at the end of which, as we could see, was a tower with a Ukrainian guard.</span> <span id="s1534">In the corner at the hidden behind that...uh... carpenter's shop was an improvised ladder.</span> <span id="s1535">Two pieces of wood with rungs across.</span> <span id="s1536">I didn't know about it at that time.</span> <span id="s1537">But suddenly that ladder was up the fence; and they keeped...the people were scrambling in a tremendous chaos to get on that ladder and under the fence, and just away.</span> <span id="s1538">Now I'm in my hut, and I'm watching; and I am watching the Ukrainian, what he will do.</span> <span id="s1539">Whether he will start shooting or what.</span> <span id="s1540">And he was just standing, and didn't react.</span> <span id="s1541">And the yard was getting emptier and emptier.</span> <span id="s1542">And then he picks up his rifle to prepare to use it.</span> <span id="s1543">At that time, a shot was fired next to my hut in the...in the mechanics shop.</span> <span id="s1544">That was Shlomo Szmajzner, who stole a rifle in the barracks of the Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s1545">He shot at him.</span> <span id="s1546">He didn't hit him.</span> <span id="s1547">Whether he heard that bullet...bullet pass by or whatever, he put his rifle back to his foot.</span> <span id="s1548">When he did that I says to myself, "Now it's time for me to go."</span> <span id="s1549">And I ran to that ladder, got over on top of the ladder and jumped down into the mine field.</span> <span id="s1550">But nothing happened, somehow.</span> <span id="s1551">We have, of course, tried to neutralize it long before.</span> <span id="s1552">Whenever we could, we took a stone, threw it over the fence into the mine fields, and sometimes they...we hit a mine and it exploded.</span> <span id="s1553">Sometimes a rabbit probably exploded another mine, if it was heavy enough.</span> <span id="s1554">I do not know.</span> <span id="s1555">But that's what we did; but I got through.</span> <span id="s1556">And as I run now, behind me was Shlomo Szmajzner with that rifle.</span> <span id="s1557">I only found out later.</span> <span id="s1558">He was the last, and I was the second before last who got away over the fence.</span> <span id="s1559">There was a dead girl there.</span> <span id="s1560">Her name was Myra.</span> <span id="s1561">Shot by the salvos which came from the other yard toward that spot there we were running away.</span> <span id="s1562">And as I walked fast...I run first, and then I only walked.</span> <span id="s1563">I took over, I passed up Yossel Siegel [NB: Josef Siegel]; and he says to me in Yiddish, he says, "Kurt, loif!"</span> <span id="s1564">--"Kurt, run!"</span> <span id="s1565">And I says, "Yossel, I don't run anymore.</span> <span id="s1566">I am a free man."</span> <span id="s1567">But, of course, that was eu...euphoria.</span> <span id="s1568">We were not free, because we had nothing.</span> <span id="s1569">We were exposed to the dangers of being caught by the Germans or delivered by the Polish population.</span> <span id="s1570">Whatever.</span> <span id="s1571">But anyhow, I felt that I am the big hero.</span> <span id="s1572">I'm...I was free.</span> <span id="s1573">And I land in the forest, which was called the Forest of Owls--which in Polish is "Sobi," which is a owl, and "bór" is a forest.</span> <span id="s1574">"Sobibór"--that's where the name comes from.</span> <span id="s1575">Somebody came to me there.</span> <span id="s1576">It was half dark already.</span> <span id="s1577">He had, uh, a little, uh, shot on, on...he was a little damaged on the calf; and I bandage...bandaged.</span> <span id="s1578">I had bandages and stuff with me.</span> <span id="s1579">And then Chaim and Engel--Chaim and Selma....</span> <span id="s1580">The girl [NB: Selma] was from Holland, from Zwolle; and he was from _ód_, Chaim.</span> <span id="s1581">We are there; and Minnie didn't make it.</span> <span id="s1582">My friend did not make it, I was waiting.</span> <span id="s1583">So then they say to me, "Kurt, why don't you come with us?"</span> <span id="s1584">And I felt where they are two, a third isn't necessary.</span> <span id="s1585">And I says, "No, I..</span> <span id="s1586">.</span> <span id="s1587">I'm going on my own."</span> <span id="s1588">And this Otto Sandner--a young kid maybe 18 years old--says, "I'm coming with you."</span> <span id="s1589">He was from Czechoslovakia, also from Moravia; and he came with one of the last transports.</span> <span id="s1590">Must have been maybe 5,000 people, taken out for labor.</span> <span id="s1591">So we walk....</span> <span id="s1592">By the way, then small groups were founded...uh...formed, and each went on his own.</span> <span id="s1593">There was no more cohes...cohesiveness.</span> <span id="s1594">So we walk through the forest.</span> <span id="s1595">And when we were far enough, we tore from trees a few branches and lie down.</span> <span id="s1596">We were exhausted.</span> <span id="s1597">The next morning--it was already daytime--we were awoken by the bells of cows who were going on pasture.</span> <span id="s1598">And we got up--it rained at night, we were wet--and walked again in direction away from the camp.</span> <span id="s1599">And I had two plans: to go either to the farmer, if he would save me, if he would hide me; and if not, I'm going farther west to Czechoslovakia, to Moravia, the...where I knew a lot of people and where I was friendly and I trusted some of them that they would hide me.</span> <span id="s1600">So as we go, we suddenly see a little house in the front of which, or on the side, there was a pile of manure.</span> <span id="s1601">And there was a young fellow working on the manure.</span> <span id="s1602">And I says to Otto, "You watch here.</span> <span id="s1603">Stay out; and I'll go in and see what...whether we can get some food."</span> <span id="s1604">There was a woman in there.</span> <span id="s1605">I says, "I'm hungry.</span> <span id="s1606">I want food."</span> <span id="s1607">She got scared; and I says, "We would like to have butter and bread."</span> <span id="s1608">And uh she says, "I don't have any butter, but I will send my son to the [szoltis (ph)]."</span> <span id="s1609">Which is like the...the mayor of that complex.</span> <span id="s1610">They have homes between the fields.</span> <span id="s1611">It is not like a village here.</span> <span id="s1612">There is one home here, and another one far away, which belongs in the vicinity to their own fields.</span> <span id="s1613">You know?</span> <span id="s1614">So she sent the boy to get some butter.</span> <span id="s1615">And Otto came in, and she gave us some black Chicory coffee, and some bread and cottage cheese.</span> <span id="s1616">And when we are through with eating, we were watching whether this fellow is coming back alone or with somebody else.</span> <span id="s1617">But, uh, she says, "Where do you come from?"</span> <span id="s1618">In Polish; and I talked some Polish.</span> <span id="s1619">And I says, "Oh, we are from Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1620">We work for the Germans in a camp, and we run away and we are going back home."</span> <span id="s1621">And she tells me, "You are Jews who...who got away from Sobibór, where they are burning the Jews."</span> <span id="s1622">In Polish: "[Do _ydow palenie (ph)]."</span> <span id="s1623">That means, "where they're burning the Jews."</span> <span id="s1624">Well, I didn't have any discussion with her.</span> <span id="s1625">Uh, Otto stole a knife with which we were cutting our bread, and we left.</span> <span id="s1626">Oh, pardon me.</span> <span id="s1627">I gave her from the money which I had an old Tsaristic ten ruble piece--gold, which she recognized; and she gave me Polish currency in paper as change.</span> <span id="s1628">It was either 60 or 80 zlotys.</span> <span id="s1629">And we left.</span> <span id="s1630">And we walked that day and whenever we saw a farmer in the field, I went there and I says, "[To dim kierownku (ph)]?"</span> <span id="s1631">That means, "In what direction is Lublin?"</span> <span id="s1632">-- which was approximately west of us.</span> <span id="s1633">And they tell me like that.</span> <span id="s1634">We never walked on roads; but always only through fields or, if necessary, through a forest--because we didn't want to be caught by somebody in a car, by a German, you know.</span> <span id="s1635">Whatever.</span> <span id="s1636">And that evening, the first night, we slept in a hayloft in the fields.</span> <span id="s1637">It was nothing but four poles with a thatched roof and full of hay.</span> <span id="s1638">And when we crawled up in there, there was a berth.</span> <span id="s1639">Somebody slept there before us; because there was always...also an empty bottle there.</span> <span id="s1640">So we lie down and we slept.</span> <span id="s1641">And the next morning we did the same thing.</span> <span id="s1642">Again we asked, "Where is Piaski now?"</span> <span id="s1643">And during that day we came to a river.</span> <span id="s1644">It was the River Wieprz--which means "war" in... in English.</span> <span id="s1645">And that was hard to...to cross, but we had to cross it.</span> <span id="s1646">So we walk a little bit along the river.</span> <span id="s1647">It was November, cold.</span> <span id="s1648">We would have...we would have to swim it.</span> <span id="s1649">It was rather deep and not very wide, but still....</span> <span id="s1650">And there I see a boy, a young boy with a boat.</span> <span id="s1651">Well, I says, "Come here and take us across the...the river."</span> <span id="s1652">And he says, "I am not allowed to."</span> <span id="s1653">And I give him those 80 zlotys which I had, or 60 zlotys.</span> <span id="s1654">He takes the money.</span> <span id="s1655">He put us on the boat and takes us across.</span> <span id="s1656">I want to tell you, there was so many coincidences which was pure luck.</span> <span id="s1657">One of them doesn't work out, and we are licked.</span> <span id="s1658">So then we again...we got food some in...some in some homes.</span> <span id="s1659">And that evening, we went in the evening...before we went to sleep in a..</span> <span id="s1660">.</span> <span id="s1661">in another farmer's house; and we knocked at the door, and we asked for food and we got some food.</span> <span id="s1662">I think the people were giving us food there are afraid that we would avenge ourselves, whatever.</span> <span id="s1663">Not out of goodness of their heart.</span> <span id="s1664">At least, I don't believe so.</span> <span id="s1665">Then we went back into a meadow; and in the meantime it was already half dark and we hear shooting.</span> <span id="s1666">We assumed that the owner of that house now went out to scare us away, to tell us that he has weapons.</span> <span id="s1667">Well, anyhow, we...we didn't have any such ideas.</span> <span id="s1668">We just wanted to survive.</span> <span id="s1669">We get into this meadow, and there were small piles of hay.</span> <span id="s1670">They handled the hay entirely differently than in this country.</span> <span id="s1671">The hay is rolled.</span> <span id="s1672">Over there, they put it together with forks and make little piles.</span> <span id="s1673">And then when the weather is convenient and they have the time, they take those piles and put them on carriages and bring them back home in...into a barn.</span> <span id="s1674">I remember we took two or three of those piles, put them into one pile; and each of us crawled then into this one pile and slept through.</span> <span id="s1675">In the morning, when we awoke and crawled out, it was raining all night.</span> <span id="s1676">And we were dry like bone, because the water was running down on that hay.</span> <span id="s1677">I didn't know that until I found out in my own experience; but the meadow was so water soaked, as you walked in it you could hear the swishing.</span> <span id="s1678">So that was the second night.</span> <span id="s1679">Then there was...that was, I believe...Sunday?</span> <span id="s1680">Well, anyhow, the next night we slept again in a hayloft.</span> <span id="s1681">But I am not sure, but I think we slept two nights in two haylofts.</span> <span id="s1682">And that was Sunday morning, when we got out again.</span> <span id="s1683">And as we walk, we see single home again.</span> <span id="s1684">And as we approach it to the left, there was like a burned out home.</span> <span id="s1685">And I walk over there, and there were some remnants of Jewish prayer books.</span> <span id="s1686">So I knew that this was a home occupied by Jews who was burned down.</span> <span id="s1687">To the right and forward a little bit, there was a horse behind the fence of a house looking at us.</span> <span id="s1688">And in the meantime, a man comes out.</span> <span id="s1689">We approach him; and I says to him, "We would like to get some food."</span> <span id="s1690">And he says, "Come in."</span> <span id="s1691">I was very suspicious.</span> <span id="s1692">He gave us good, white bread, preserves.</span> <span id="s1693">This is no joke.</span> <span id="s1694">He gave us hot water to wash.</span> <span id="s1695">I shaved with his own razor--with his safety razor, not...with a straight razor.</span> <span id="s1696">I knew how to do that.</span> <span id="s1697">And we got dressed again.</span> <span id="s1698">He didn't ask a question from...he didn't...he knew what's going on, probably.</span> <span id="s1699">I gave him some money, a gold coin; and we left.</span> <span id="s1700">That was Sunday.</span> <span id="s1701">We slept one night in the forest, one in a hayloft, one on the meadow, and the last night again in the...in a hayloft.</span> <span id="s1702">But I forgot now the...the sequence exactly.</span> <span id="s1703">It was Monday, Monday morning.</span> <span id="s1704">And we are already close to Piaski.</span> <span id="s1705">And in the meantime, I explained to Otto everything about this farmer.</span> <span id="s1706">He has a daughter.</span> <span id="s1707">She goes on the bicycle to Piaski.</span> <span id="s1708">She works in a bank, whatever.</span> <span id="s1709">And I tell him all the circumstances, get him acquainted with him.</span> <span id="s1710">And I also gave him at one time a few coins, gold coins; that if he has to go to shop or whatever, that he would have money on him.</span> <span id="s1711">That afternoon--and I must tell you, I can't...did I understand...don't understand at all...I have a very bad, miserable, impossible sense of direction.</span> <span id="s1712">I can get lost in my town easily.</span> <span id="s1713">I can go in the wrong direction in my car until I find out that I should have gone the other way.</span> <span id="s1714">Anyhow, we come and we are in Siedliszczki; in the outskirts of Siedliszczki, in that little village.</span> <span id="s1715">But it was still daytime.</span> <span id="s1716">And we lie down in a ditch.</span> <span id="s1717">And when it did get dark, I'm going to try to find my farmer's house.</span> <span id="s1718">And I landed from the back at his barn at the exit of the yard.</span> <span id="s1719">And on that yard, there were two more...living two more farmers.</span> <span id="s1720">One was [Kisolecki (ph)]...[Kisolewski (ph)]; and the other one [Sokolowski (ph)].</span> <span id="s1721">They knew me and I knew them, because in, in....</span> <span id="s1722">Because they were all friendly, you know.</span> <span id="s1723">They lived on that big yard; but only my farmer had the barn there.</span> <span id="s1724">Coming in from the field, the barn was to the left.</span> <span id="s1725">In front of it was the dog's...dog house.</span> <span id="s1726">To the right, was his stable with the two horses and three cows.</span> <span id="s1727">And then there was the pig sty.</span> <span id="s1728">Do you say pig "sty" or "stay"?</span></p> <p><span id="s1729">Q:Pig sty.</span></p> <p><span id="s1730">A:Pig sty?</span> <span id="s1731">And then was in front of it a little shed.</span> <span id="s1732">On the other side was another stable, which belonged to those two other farmers.</span> <span id="s1733">In front of it was a pile of manure; and on the other side, in front of that shed, there was also a pile of manure.</span> <span id="s1734">And then there was a little yard-like fence.</span> <span id="s1735">And to the right hand side was one of the farmers living with his family--a mother-in-law and two or three children.</span> <span id="s1736">And on the other side was my farmer in a thatched roof home, like all those homes were.</span> <span id="s1737">It was Monday night, and it...it was already pretty dark.</span> <span id="s1738">As I passed the dog--his name was Caesar--he recognized me.</span> <span id="s1739">He didn't even bark.</span> <span id="s1740">He just moved his tail and sniffed at me.</span> <span id="s1741">And I..</span> <span id="s1742">.</span> <span id="s1743">I petted him and I continued walking...to walk in the yard.</span> <span id="s1744">And I opened the little gate to the farmer's little front yard, you know.</span> <span id="s1745">And I look in, and there I see a petrol lamp and they are eating-- which they baked every Monday, that was a Monday, sweet bread.</span> <span id="s1746">I mean, not sweetbreads...sweet bread baked in their own oven, and chicory coffee.</span> <span id="s1747">They baked the bread for the whole week's supply every Monday.</span> <span id="s1748">But they made one loaf which was mixed with sugar beets and poppy seed.</span> <span id="s1749">And that was the sweetness in it.</span> <span id="s1750">And they ate that; and then on Tuesday after the next Sunday, they ate the dark bread.</span> <span id="s1751">And I see, and I'm waiting now until he will go and make his rounds to let the dog loose, and to lock the barn and the stable.</span> <span id="s1752">A little while later, the far...uh, the day worker--his name was Joseph--came out.</span> <span id="s1753">He didn't see me.</span> <span id="s1754">That's how dark it was.</span> <span id="s1755">And he walks out, and walks away through the little gate.</span> <span id="s1756">And not too long later, the farmer comes out; and I says, "Gospodarzu."</span> <span id="s1757">That means, "Farmer."</span> <span id="s1758">I called him "Farmer."</span> <span id="s1759">But this is...in the Polish language, it is like a title.</span> <span id="s1760">That was uh, a..</span> <span id="s1761">.</span> <span id="s1762">respectful, you know?</span> <span id="s1763">And he says to me, [Jetisdu bedisz (ph)]?"</span> <span id="s1764">--"Where do you come from?"</span> <span id="s1765">He recognized me right away.</span> <span id="s1766">In that darkness with that one word which I said, "Gospodarzu."</span> <span id="s1767">And I says to him, again in Polish, "I came to save my life to you."</span> <span id="s1768">And he says, "Marno."</span> <span id="s1769">He says, "In vain."</span> <span id="s1770">And then he says, "[Czostsamnu (ph)]."</span> <span id="s1771">--"Come with me."</span> <span id="s1772">And as I walked with him, he says, "I owe you some money."</span> <span id="s1773">That how decent and honest he was!</span> <span id="s1774">He owed me money for that suit which I sold him, 700 zlotys.</span> <span id="s1775">I says, "I don't need any money.</span> <span id="s1776">I have a little money on my own."</span> <span id="s1777">"Where do you come from?"</span> <span id="s1778">I says, "I run away from a concentration camp."</span> <span id="s1779">He put me in the...in the stable with the horses, locked it from the outside; came back in a little while with a bottle of hot coffee.</span> <span id="s1780">Yeah, by the way, Otto was left in the fields--not too far, but maybe...maybe a hundred, hundred fifty yards.</span> <span id="s1781">And he says to me also as we walk to...to the stable, he says, "[Ale ty sam amnisz (ph)]."</span> <span id="s1782">--"But you are alone."</span> <span id="s1783">I says, "Yes."</span> <span id="s1784">I figured if I say we are two, I have lesser chances.</span> <span id="s1785">He put me in the barn; and then he come back later on with that hot coffee, with that sweet bread, with that little carpet.</span> <span id="s1786">He put that carpet in the stable on the floor, on...on the straw, next to the horses.</span> <span id="s1787">And he says, "I'll see you in the morning, early in the morning."</span> <span id="s1788">And I drank and I ate, and lie down on the...that was a home woven carpet.</span> <span id="s1789">This is made out of rags.</span> <span id="s1790">You tear the rags into strips, and then you braid it between the...waft [NB: weft?]</span> <span id="s1791">, I believe, you call it in English.</span> <span id="s1792">It wasn't bigger than maybe a good yard long.</span> <span id="s1793">I laid down there.</span> <span id="s1794">At night I awake when one of the horses got loose and smells at me.</span> <span id="s1795">And that woke me; and in the darkness I knew where it's supposed to be, and I got up and got that horse....</span> <span id="s1796">By the way, that was a beautiful mare.</span> <span id="s1797">It was a half-blooded mare.</span> <span id="s1798">When she walked, the head up, it was a pleasure to look at...at that horse.</span> <span id="s1799">The other one was not so lively.</span> <span id="s1800">But this one here, I loved that horse.</span> <span id="s1801">And I took her back to the throw, and put the halter on; and lie down, back on that...whatever...when I found then the carpet and slept.</span> <span id="s1802">He came around...I don't know...5 o'clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s1803">It was still dark.</span> <span id="s1804">And he took me into the barn, across the yard kitty corner-like into his barn.</span> <span id="s1805">And I crawled up on the ladder; then when it got a little bit lighter, high up in the stacks of straw or whatever there was.</span> <span id="s1806">In the afternoon, the farmeress comes with a bucket in which she had hot tea in a bottle and bread with lard; and gave me the food and told me that they had visitors at night.</span> <span id="s1807">Some people came; and they were sign...some kind of little bit acquainted, because they knew they have a daughter named Joann and they have a bicycle...she has a bicycle.</span> <span id="s1808">And they wanted that bicycle.</span> <span id="s1809">I knew right away what happened, but I didn't tell her.</span> <span id="s1810">Otto must have bumped into some group of people; and he told them what I knew about this farmer, and they came to ask for the bicycle.</span> <span id="s1811">And he must have joined that group, probably; or maybe they did away with him.</span> <span id="s1812">I do not know, but I never found Otto; because I later on inquired in that town from where he came whether he returned.</span> <span id="s1813">I didn't get an answer.</span> <span id="s1814">So that was the arrival in...in...in Siedliszczki.</span></p> <p><span id="s1815">Q:We have only about ten minutes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1816">A:All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1817">Q:Can you tell us briefly what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1818">A:All right.</span> <span id="s1819">I was in that barn; and during the next few days, [Wacek (ph)], the man who used to work there for them at the time when I was there the first time, a year before, wasn't there anymore.</span> <span id="s1820">They had this time a maid; and she comes into the barn, and I was down there and she sees me.</span> <span id="s1821">Well, then the farmer comes and she tells me...he tells me, "She saw you."</span> <span id="s1822">I says, "Yes."</span> <span id="s1823">Well, he didn't say...he didn't complain.</span> <span id="s1824">He says, "I'll take you Monday in the pig sty up on top."</span> <span id="s1825">Which he did.</span> <span id="s1826">They brought me food either in the barn or over there later on in a bucket; always three times a day--breakfast, at noontime and at dinner.</span> <span id="s1827">On that Monday, early morning, he took me from the barn again across the yard.</span> <span id="s1828">And I crawled up a wall in the shack...in the shed there, which was the wall of the pig sty.</span> <span id="s1829">And he told me to go down deep there.</span> <span id="s1830">And then later on during the daytime, his day worker who he hired--the same Joseph--he was bringing straw from the barn, and he was with me up there to fill in all the holes so that the wind and the cold wouldn't come into that enclosure now.</span> <span id="s1831">Joseph...Joseph did not know...Joseph did not know that I'm up there.</span> <span id="s1832">Only the farmer.</span> <span id="s1833">And when he was done with the job, he went down; and now they started to feed me up there.</span> <span id="s1834">There was a..</span> <span id="s1835">.</span> <span id="s1836">there was some firewood like in front of that barn...that wall on which he always stacked, or the woman--the farmeress.</span> <span id="s1837">And then they gave me this stuff; and I came up from where I was lying down there, got the bucket and the food.</span> <span id="s1838">And I had there a bucket which I was using as a toilet, which he emptied once a week.</span> <span id="s1839">Which I gave him, and he poured on the...on the...on one of the two piles of manure.</span> <span id="s1840">That was...that was my comfort.</span> <span id="s1841">And...uh...that's how I lived there.</span> <span id="s1842">I could not stand up.</span> <span id="s1843">I was kneeling in the center only.</span> <span id="s1844">Even that was almost as high as my head was; because the roof was very low.</span> <span id="s1845">And I told him that I would like him to buy me three things: change underwear, a blanket, and a revolver.</span> <span id="s1846">And I gave him couple gold coins.</span> <span id="s1847">And he brought me a change of underwear and a blanket; but he says a revolver he can't get.</span> <span id="s1848">So now I had at least that blanket with...in which I crawled in, like in a..</span> <span id="s1849">.</span> <span id="s1850">I made like a sack out of it, you know, and into the straw.</span> <span id="s1851">And there I slept and...and...and...uh...rested all day and all night.</span> <span id="s1852">I never went down the whole time from October 21st [1943], I believe, until the very end of July [1944].</span> <span id="s1853">Uh...I had a few experiences...</span></p> <p><span id="s1854">Q:We don't really have time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1855">A:Then...then I will tell you then what happened while I was on...on the roof.</span></p> <p><span id="s1856">Q:Please, we have five minutes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1857">A:Okay.</span> <span id="s1858">Gee, I work without those notes!</span> <span id="s1859">I'm sure I forgot many things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1860">Q:That's okay.</span> <span id="s1861">Tell us what happened...uh...on the roof and then liberation, would you?</span> <span id="s1862">Because that's really all we have time for.</span></p> <p><span id="s1863">A:Okay.</span> <span id="s1864">(Pause - checking notes) 10/25, I have here a note.</span> <span id="s1865">"From barn to pig sty.</span> <span id="s1866">Joseph.</span> <span id="s1867">Straw.</span> <span id="s1868">Podsiali with me.</span> <span id="s1869">Money to get underwear, blanket, revolver."</span></p> <p><span id="s1870">Q:Let's...let's....</span> <span id="s1871">Okay.</span> <span id="s1872">Just tell us about liberation, would you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1873">A:Now, is the new...is the new tape already on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1874">Q:No.</span> <span id="s1875">We don't know.</span> <span id="s1876">We have five minutes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1877">A:Oh.</span> <span id="s1878">Oh.</span> <span id="s1879">And that's it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1880">Q:That's it.</span> <span id="s1881">So, please, tell me about liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1882">A:Anyway, as summer went along I could hear machine....</span> <span id="s1883">What you call it?</span> <span id="s1884">Machine...uh...rifle shooting.</span> <span id="s1885">And farther away, also cannon shooting.</span> <span id="s1886">The front was coming closer.</span> <span id="s1887">And every day it was closer and closer, until one day I see my farmer.</span> <span id="s1888">I looked through that thatched roof on the yard, and I see him loading a carriage to go into the fields.</span> <span id="s1889">And in the meantime, I hear an explosion.</span> <span id="s1890">A shrapnel was going above, and then it exploded.</span> <span id="s1891">And the farmeress got very excited.</span> <span id="s1892">And she was holding a cup of something in her hand.</span> <span id="s1893">And he says to her in Polish, "Don't be excited...afraid of those who do you hear.</span> <span id="s1894">They go far away.</span> <span id="s1895">Those who explode in front of you, those you don't hear."</span> <span id="s1896">They didn't go into the fields.</span> <span id="s1897">A day later, a German tank came into that...went through this yard.</span> <span id="s1898">And another day later, in the morning, there were Russian soldiers with little carriages and horses, and women soldiers--we called them "Marushas"--later in the yard.</span> <span id="s1899">And they left, too; and then about two, three days later I went down.</span> <span id="s1900">By the way, uh...I was so weak that I hardly walked; but I did.</span> <span id="s1901">And when we parted he told me, "Don't go through the village.</span> <span id="s1902">Go into the fields.</span> <span id="s1903">Because if they find out, the villagers, that if I kept a Jew, they'll kill me."</span> <span id="s1904">That's what he told me.</span> <span id="s1905">And I went back into the fields toward Piaski.</span> <span id="s1906">And there Russian soldiers got hold of me.</span> <span id="s1907">And then they made a PW out of me for a while, or whatever.</span> <span id="s1908">And then I got away from them; and I smuggled myself through different situation in Poland until I came home.</span> <span id="s1909">And that is the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s1910">Q:Okay.</span> <span id="s1911">I thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1912">A:You're very, very welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s1913">Q:When did you come to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1914">A:I came to the United States on February the 4th, 1948.</span> <span id="s1915">And that's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1916">Q:Thank you very, very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1917">A:I thank you, too.</span> <span id="s1918">I, I think that some of these things should be preserved.</span> <span id="s1919">Mainly, you know, the person of those...of those two farmers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1920">Q:Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s1921">That's an incredible story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1922">A:They were noble people.</span> <span id="s1923">I was a lucky guy.</span> <span id="s1924">They were the heroes.</span> <span id="s1925">They were the decent people who, out of so many millions who took advantage of the Jewish people, really tried to save my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1926">Q:Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1927">A:At one time he told me...when he came back from a wedding a little bit drunk.</span> <span id="s1928">He never was otherwise.</span> <span id="s1929">"You I will keep 'til the end of the war.</span> <span id="s1930">Anybody else, I wouldn't take for a million of zlotys in gold."</span> <span id="s1931">And as he talked to me, I was coming out from my hiding place and I could smell the volka on him.</span> <span id="s1932">But that is the only time.</span> <span id="s1933">These were two fabulous people.</span> <span id="s1934">I am in touch with the daughter, Todzia.</span> <span id="s1935">I forgot you when she brought me at Easter one time a basket with vodka and...and, uh, cookies.</span> <span id="s1936">She lives in Lublin, and we are in touch.</span></p> <p><span id="s1937">Q:Sounds like marvelous, marvelous people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1938">A:These are one in I don't know how many.</span> <span id="s1939">If only somebody would interview me to write about them.</span> <span id="s1940">Not about me, about them.</span> <span id="s1941">They deserve it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1942">Q:About them.</span> <span id="s1943">Yeah, they sure do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1944">A:They do deserve to be remembered in history.</span></p> <p><span id="s1945">Q:They do indeed, and they will be.</span></p> <p><span id="s1946">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION The family Petschek--consisting of Otto Petschek, his brothers, and their families--became highly successful as bankers and industrialists under the Masaryk government.</span></p> <p><span id="s1947">He appears to have confused two buildings.</span> <span id="s1948">The Petschek family bank building--the one to which he is probably referring here--was used as Gestapo headquarters during the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia from 1939 to 1949.</span> <span id="s1949">It now houses the Czech Ministry of Foreign Trade.</span> <span id="s1950">The Petschek Palace was an elegant mansion house on Zigmunda Wintra Street, built by Otto Petschek for his wife and four children in the 1920s.</span> <span id="s1951">In March 1939, it was commandeered by General Faber, the Nazi military governor of Prague, as his official residence.</span></p> <p><span id="s1952">A fortress-prison located in Brno.</span></p> <p><span id="s1953">Interviewee has identified this lady in his writings as Sophie Wiener.</span></p> <p><span id="s1954">This is in 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s1955">Reference to Teddy Kollek, longtime mayor of Jerusalem subsequent to the 1967 War.</span></p> <p><span id="s1956">Now: Karlovy Vary.</span> <span id="s1957">Town in Czechoslovakia known for its sulfur springs.</span> <span id="s1958">Located 70 miles west of Prague on the River Oh_e, in area formerly considered the Sudetenland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1959">Other accounts indicate that Barry was used by SS Oberscharführer Paul Groth to attack the prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s1960">In subsequent communication, interviewee identified this transport as originating in Brest Litovsk.</span> <span id="s1961">See Kurt Thomas, Appendix I (Letter to Linda Gordon Kuzmack, dated March 18, 1991), attached.</span></p> <p><span id="s1962">The actual Polish word for owl is "sowa."</span> <span id="s1963">Interviewee subseqently corrected the month to October.</span> <span id="s1964">See Appendix I.</span></p> <p><span id="s1965">She is named elsewhere as Theodora (nicknamed: "Todzia").</span></p> <p><span id="s1966">USHMM Archives RG-50.030*233 page \* arabic2 USHMM Archives RG-50.030*233 page \* arabic21</span></p> <p><span id="s1967">page \* arabic21</span></p></body></html>
