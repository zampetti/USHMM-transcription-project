situation?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: They had to go shopping a few days a week into Havana to be able to get some kosher food and the only thing we were able to get near the house was like bread or butter, but otherwise if we had to – need any meats or anything, we had to go to Havana because there was no refrigeration.</span> <span id="s181">It was an icebox and there was no way to keep anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: What was it like for your family in this new culture, not just with respect to religion, but with respect to the culture as oppose to what you had been use to in Poland.</span> <span id="s183">Were the problems adjusting to life in Cuba?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: There was a problem adjusting because it was also that we knew we were not liked there, though some of the neighbors were nice, but we were not liked as Jews, and we were also not secure there.</span> <span id="s185">So we knew it was also temporary stay – hoping that sooner than later we would be able to come to this country.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: So did you experience anti-Semitism in Cuba?</span> <span id="s187">Can you explain?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: Yes, we did, because of the way they use to talk to us, especially as children, and kids here at home – about Jewish kids – so they use to come home and express it to us and we tried to get away from them, not even to answer them.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: Can you explain some of the – give me some examples of what you’re saying.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: I really don’t – I remember some things that we tried to get away from them – not to answer them, but the actual things that they said, I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: Were you able to get a religious education in Cuba?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: We got some – we had private teachers to give as much Jewish education as possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: Did your parents keep in touch with family and friends back in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s195">As long as possible, they did.</span> <span id="s196">When my grandmothers passed away, the rest of the family got killed in the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: But before the war started, do you remember some of the news from Poland in the time period from ’37 to ’39?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: All I remember is that they use to say they didn’t know how much longer they would be here and they starting to run, and they don’t know how long it would last.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: Do you remember hearing that Germany had attacked Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: Yes I do hear – I do remember that, but they never – they never told the kids how bad it was.</span> <span id="s201">We use to hear “it’s bad” {Polish spoken}, but that’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: If you didn’t hear from your parents, did you have exposure to that news outside of the home?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: No, we didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: What language did you speak inside your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: Yiddish.</span> <span id="s206">Again, I’m use to answering Yiddish, and my parents would speak Polish, some Russian because the town we came from was – it was Poland and it was White Russia, and then it was Poland again.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: During the war, did you have any idea what was happening to the Jews in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: Well, we knew that they were being killed and they were chased from town to town or how they would hide from house to house, but that’s all I can remember</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: How was the war taught in schools – in Cuba during the actual war period?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: We weren’t told too much about it, because we were in a Catholic country, and they didn’t talk too much about it.</span> <span id="s211">Especially, they were afraid the Jewish kids would pick up too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: What was positioned of the population of Cuba just a general population.</span> <span id="s213">What were their views on the conflict in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: I truthfully don’t remember.</span> <span id="s215">Maybe there’s a lot that I blocked out.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: Do you remember seeing any news reels, or newspapers, or hearing the radio?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s218">There was always – there was always a Yiddish paper in the house, because that’s what my parents read and the radio use to always be on and they use to try and pick up the Yiddish stations there to hear what’s going on with the war and everything</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: Can you remember anything from that time period?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: No, I don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: Who were your friends when you were in Cuba?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: We had just a couple of friends, not too many because they were – a lot of them were ___, and my parents always wanted us to have Jewish friends, even though some of them were very nice.</span> <span id="s223">But, still we wanted to associate with Jewish kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: There were other – you said there were other people who like you who had come to Cuba?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: Can you tell me from where those other people came, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: They came – a lot of them came from our home town and they came to Cuba with the same idea.</span> <span id="s228">Now, some of them, when they were able to let their kids come to the States, they sent them back themselves.</span> <span id="s229">My parents didn’t want to send us by ourselves.</span> <span id="s230">Then if we can’t go, then none of us</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: Do you remember hearing the war in Europe was over?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: What do you remember about that experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: It was a big day.</span> <span id="s235">It was in April of ’45.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: I had asked you about when the war was over if you remember the experience and you were telling me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: The war was over in May of ’45, and not only was that a big day, but my uncle that took us to Cuba, and my brother, got married that day.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: Tell me what was going on in your life on – on that day or in that week besides your uncle’s wedding, but with you.</span> <span id="s239">What was happening to you, and what were your thoughts and reactions?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: It was a happy day, because we all could see a change in everybody that it was over, and hopefully be a better time.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: When was the last time you had any contact, you meaning this time your family had any contact with your relatives in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: It was the early 40’s and after that they didn’t hear much at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: Did your parents have any idea what was truly happening in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: Well, they knew they didn’t want us kids dead, because not only did they hear it, they read it in the papers, but whatever they heard from the family writing, they knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: What attempts were made by your parents to find relatives or friends after the war was over?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: They tried to write to different families that they had in different places in the world, and nobody was able to find anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: Can you remember when you started hearing the truth about what had happened in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: It was after the war and I was already a little bit older, then we really started realizing what was happening, and about killing the Jews and about how we actually struggled on what they did to us and that’s why we were persecuted running from place to place, and we just couldn’t wait to be able to come to this country.</span> <span id="s249">Hopefully it would have been a better life than what we had in Cuba.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: Did you have any – do you have any good memories of life in Cuba?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: Not that much, no, because we were persecuted there, too.</span> <span id="s252">We knew that it was a Catholic country, and they didn’t like us much.</span> <span id="s253">There were a few neighbors that were nice, but in

with your background and personal experience, brought to the museum?</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: Well, talking to some people, you bring up some ideas and you remember some things, and it

children.</span> <span id="s330">But, right now, I cannot bring it up in my mind exactly what had been said.</span> <span id="s331">Now, there was a number of Negro children that they just come down –

moment.</span> <span id="s344">This is tape one, side B.</span> <span id="s345">We are interviewing Goldie Gendelmen.</span> <span id="s346">When you are settled in this country, did you and your parents ever stop and reflect about what had happened to the Jewish community in Poland and all that you not being in Poland or able to miss or avoid?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: Well, by the grace of God we missed it, and we are alive today.</span> <span id="s348">Otherwise, we might not had a made it either just like the other -- the rest of the six million Jews that got killed.</span> <span id="s349">So, it was a wonderful thing that we left.</span> <span id="s350">We struggled in Cuba, but it was wonderful.</span> <span id="s351">It paid off.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: Is there anything that you’d like to add that I didn’t ask you, you’d like to mention now?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: Well, I wanna say my father died 32 years ago.</span> <span id="s354">My mother

and another one on the way.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: Have you ever been back to Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: Never did, because I wouldn’t recognize anything, and there’s probably nothing there to recognize, hearing from people that have gone back.</span> <span id="s359">Now, I have a few landslides here, went back several years ago, and their much older than me – well, when I say much older, I mean 15 years older, and they couldn’t recognize anything.</span> <span id="s360">They left like a year or two before me, and they couldn’t recognize it, so I definitely wouldn’t</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: Do you think that your experiences and your husband’s experiences from your childhood and his experiences in the war, do you think that had an impact on how you raised your children?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: Absolutely</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: Can you explain?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: Well, we tried to bring them up for them to know what went on in the war, and to be open about it, and to be strong.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: Has your religious views changed since the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: No, not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: Have you taken your children to the museum?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: Both of my children have been there, and both my older grandchildren have been there, too.</span> <span id="s369">And, I took them one time when I was working there, and I let them go by themselves through Daniel’s story and upstairs a little bit, and they’re talking about going back, and I’ll take them back.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: I want to ask you, what kinds of things you emphasized about your life story to your children when you told them.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: Well, they were very surprised, but they realized it was very tough, and they are glad that they are here and didn’t go through it, and they are stronger people.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: Is there anything you’d like to add before we conclude today?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: We are – we are glad we are in this country, it’s a wonderful country and so for its good and we haven’t seen too much anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s374">We hear about it, but we, ourselves, haven’t gotten it – I can’t think of the word I want to use, but haven’t come across it, and hopefully we won’t and my grandchildren won’t either.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: Do you ever speak to any groups of people?</span> <span id="s376">Perhaps, children, students that came into the museum, who are of the Hispanic background?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: If they ask me, if they come over to the desk, and they ask me, I do speak to them, children or grownups, I do, if they ask me questions, but I don’t approach them, unless they come over to our desk.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: Any final reflections on what the war years were like in Cuba, anything – has anything come to your mind since we started the interview that you would like to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: Well, as far as Cuba, it was a beautiful country, but we knew that we were never secure over there.</span> <span id="s380">It was a temporary, it was a stop off and it ended up being 11 years over there, and we really couldn’t wait for the day to live, hopefully that it would of been a better life in United States, because we didn’t know what to expect.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: I thank you very much for the interview, I know this was not easy for you today, and this concludes our interview today.</span> <span id="s382">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Conclusion of Interview</span></p></body></html>
