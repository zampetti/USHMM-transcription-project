that’s called a hardware store - and he could manage.</span> <span id="s49">I believe that by then he was already in a wheelchair.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">KL: Your mother passed away when you were very young.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">HL: Yes, she passed away in 1934, and I was born in 1928, so I was six years old when my mother passed away.</span> <span id="s52">This is why I remember very, very little.</span> <span id="s53">I have a picture of my mother in the hospital.</span> <span id="s54">She was in and out of the hospital very often.</span> <span id="s55">Later on, it was either confirmed or the family suspected that it was cancer that she died from.</span> <span id="s56">And in those days, especially in a small town or city, it was never diagnosed.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">KL: The neighborhood where you grew up after your mother died and before your father died, those years between your 6th and 12th years...</span></p> <p><span id="s58">HL: We were in Seeheim, a suburb of Darmstadt.</span> <span id="s59">It was a very, very small town.</span> <span id="s60">We had one school for all the years.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">KL: Changes in your life as the political scene changed in Germany because of the Nazis being in power, did you experience any of that at your school, could you see changes in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">HL: Well, I don’t know if they were actual changes because at that time we didn’t know any different.</span> <span id="s63">We did what we were told to do.</span> <span id="s64">In other words, we had no elective subjects like we do today.</span> <span id="s65">It was just the basic education and it was geared much more - today you would probably say survival.</span> <span id="s66">Things I remember for instance, having to go out in the field and having to pick potato bugs out of the potatoes when the green first comes through the ground, and those things were actually considered part of the school day.</span> <span id="s67">We gathered everybody and got our little containers, and it was much more geared to arts and crafts, learning how to knit, learning how to crochet, learning how to sew.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">KL: That was true of both boys and girls at school.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">HL: Yes.</span> <span id="s70">So there really I didn’t notice many changes.</span> <span id="s71">Today I think maybe the teachers in those days maybe only in a small town, if you were really not interested in a subject, they never consulted the parents.</span> <span id="s72">Or as in my case, whoever the parents - whoever acted as the parents - if you didn’t do too well the teacher just didn’t bother.</span> <span id="s73">There was something else that they got you involved in.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">KL: Do you remember your father talking with any of his neighbors about politics?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">HL: Neighbors, yes, not politics, but since we lived in a duplex, there were three other families and we would get together and in our case, the people would help more our family.</span> <span id="s76">My father was always looking for someone to give him a hand to do something.</span> <span id="s77">I remember we had a very, very small piece of land that went with the house and we would grow whatever would grow for the season, and so it was more of neighbors helping each other.</span> <span id="s78">Politics, I don’t know if it ever entered our lives until later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">KL: And that would be the beginning of...</span></p> <p><span id="s80">HL: 1938.</span> <span id="s81">We consider the war to have started in 1938.</span> <span id="s82">This is when Hitler really, I think it was Poland that he marched into.</span> <span id="s83">Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s84">And this was when his power really became known, or felt.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">KL: And do you think you would have seen visible changes in your village or...</span></p> <p><span id="s86">HL: Well, probably in our life because then my father could no longer do what he wanted to do, for instance, looking for a housekeeper.</span> <span id="s87">There were rules and regulations about children, you had a small apartment, yes the Government came in to regulate your own life.</span> <span id="s88">And I have one example that I’ve saved forever and don’t ask me why.</span> <span id="s89">As my father was in a wheelchair, we needed a blanket, and we had to request, had to put in a request to the authorities to get a blanket.</span> <span id="s90">We didn’t go to the store to buy one, you had to justify why he needed a blanket.</span> <span id="s91">Eventually we received a blanket.</span> <span id="s92">I still have it.</span> <span id="s93">You would consider it today a horse blanket.</span> <span id="s94">It’s a real, real rough brown horsehair thing and this is what was issued to use as a blanket which we had to request and were granted to receive.</span> <span id="s95">Those are minor things but I remember you did not regulate your own life.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">KL: Let’s talk about your father, then, about his illness, his ability to continue running his shop.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">HL: Yes, it was very, very difficult, and of course he did pass away in 1943, right in the middle of the war.</span> <span id="s98">I do not know the date that he was taken away from home.</span> <span id="s99">The institution was in Goddelau.</span> <span id="s100">It was an institution that we never realized what it was.</span> <span id="s101">It was a home.</span> <span id="s102">Today you would probably consider it an infirmary.</span> <span id="s103">Because he couldn’t walk anymore, he couldn’t do much anymore, so he was no longer entitled to get help in the home.</span> <span id="s104">So he was taken there.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">KL: You weren’t home at that time?</span> <span id="s106">He was abruptly taken from home?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">HL: Yes.</span> <span id="s108">I think so.</span> <span id="s109">I don’t really remember.</span> <span id="s110">All we know is that eventually one day we may have been staying at that particular time with my aunt and uncle in Seeheim because all of a sudden our father, we were told, was in a hospital.</span> <span id="s111">Later on we realized and I have a note now from Germany, where they say it was really an institution where people could no longer work and Hitler said they were not contributing anymore, and they were just absolutely put in an institution.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">How long he was there, I have to take a look at correspondence, I don’t know when he went but he died in July 1943 at the institution.</span> <span id="s113">I don’t remember anything about his funeral.</span> <span id="s114">Obviously he came and he was buried in Seeheim along at the grave with my mother and I believe my aunt in Darmstadt was responsible for all of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">KL: I wonder if your aunt and other members of the family had an inkling of what his life might have been in that institution.</span> <span id="s116">Was it a natural death as the cause of his illness or was it something unnatural.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">HL: I remember visiting him only once, that’s all I remember.</span> <span id="s118">He asked me to bring him a razor.</span> <span id="s119">Now you figure how old I was in - he died in 1943 - I was old enough to realize that my father needs a razor to shave.</span> <span id="s120">And when we came home I said to either my aunt or someone we were living with, “Oh Dad wants a shaver.”</span> <span id="s121">And they said, No, you cannot give him anything.</span> <span id="s122">So that is the only suspicion I have that he realized where he was and what he was facing, that he tried to commit suicide.</span> <span id="s123">This is the only recollection I have and find it very strange that I should remember only one visit and this is what he asked.</span> <span id="s124">I don’t know whether we ever visited him again.</span> <span id="s125">I don’t know whether my sister was along or whether I was alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">KL: I understand that you’ve received some new information about your father’s stay in the institution.</span> <span id="s127">I wonder if you would tell me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">HL: Yes, I had asked a niece in Germany, she is now in her 60’s, her mother is elderly, whether they remember anything.</span> <span id="s129">She tells me that her mother told her that Karl Rossmann was taken to Goddelau to an institution because Hitler considered him as a nonproductive person and he died eventually, which her mother suspects was - and this is German - Euthanmord, which is the word for murder.</span> <span id="s130">The official statement was Lungenentzundung, which is failure of the lungs.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">KL: I wonder if that would have been a natural occurrence given his disease, which was multiple sclerosis?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">HL: MS, yes.</span> <span id="s133">Resembling MS. That too was never established.</span> <span id="s134">Today you would probably say Parkinson’s.</span> <span id="s135">Nobody cared to analyze it, if you couldn’t walk, you couldn’t walk, period.</span> <span id="s136">I don’t know if we ever saw a doctor.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">KL: And so tell us a little about his burial, his burial site.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">HL: He was buried and I have the pictures.</span> <span id="s139">He was buried alongside my mother and of course my mother had died in 1934, and he died in 1943, but whether they ever had a plot when they moved to Seeheim, but they actually, the graves are side by side with the gravestones.</span> <span id="s140">And maybe if my aunt - she’s very elderly now - I may ask her if she remembers anything about the gravesite.</span> <span id="s141">The pictures - the names - I suspect it was she.</span> <span id="s142">Because she, because they took me in and I was part of the family, and I really think she was responsible for what happened in Seeheim, which was quite a little distance away.</span> <span id="s143">You could go by streetcar but it was a little journey.</span> <span id="s144">So today I wonder what the graves look like.</span> <span id="s145">For a while I had asked a landscape business in Seeheim to look after the graves but eventually those people got older and I didn’t want to send them money anymore without knowing what happened at the graves.</span> <span id="s146">I really have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">KL: And so once you realized that your father was gone, you and your sister were completely separated.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">HL: Separated, completely separated.</span> <span id="s149">She in Seeheim with my father’s side of the family and I in Darmstadt, which is a good-size city, with my mother’s side of the family, and my sister I always felt was really hurt a lot more.</span> <span id="s150">Number one, she was a lot younger and she lived in the country and she had a pretty difficult time.</span> <span id="s151">She always felt that I got the better side of the deal.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">KL: That was 1943 and the war was over in 1945, your were still quite young but perhaps by then being a teenager, you were aware of some deprivations as a result of the war.</span> <span id="s153">I wonder if you could tell us about that a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">HL: Well, I guess first of all would be the food.</span> <span id="s155">You did not go out shopping anymore.</span> <span id="s156">Naturally we all had the ration cards.</span> <span id="s157">You bought a loaf of bread and that was gone, you weren’t entitled to anymore.</span> <span id="s158">You just didn’t eat bread.</span> <span id="s159">I know that in a little plot of land that most people had with their home we would grow onions and potatoes and asparagus, and things that you could harvest and eat.</span> <span id="s160">So it was usually the food.</span> <span id="s161">And of course clothing, shoes or clothes, none existed.</span> <span id="s162">You just couldn’t get.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">KL: Other foodstuffs, like meat or fresh milk?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">HL: Milk you could get from neighbors who had goats or if you knew someone on a farm, but everything was just - if you were just a family with two children - we were a family of two children and father and mother, and you were entitled to just so much and you just had to spread it out and make do.</span> <span id="s165">So yes, we were really - today I wonder how we really survived on what we ate.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">KL: I think you told me once a story about your uncle having gotten one hen’s egg and it was a great celebration.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">HL: And the girls wanted to do something special with it.</span> <span id="s168">The aunt said no way, I’m going to make a meal out of this.</span> <span id="s169">They did a lot with coffee grounds, stretching things, gravy, stretch things, to brew coffee and then use it forever and ever.</span> <span id="s170">And the clothing, for instance we had one pair of shoes that we were required to clean every night when we took them off, with shoe polish.</span> <span id="s171">Where that came from I don’t know.</span> <span id="s172">Maybe it was just fat or grease or something.</span> <span id="s173">Anyway, we had to take the laces out and had to wash the laces and put the laces back in in the morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">KL: Did you have to change schools as a result of moving to your uncle’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">HL: Yes, but by then I was already what you would consider either high school or in a school to learn a profession.</span> <span id="s176">So my aunt enrolled me...I was signed up as an apprentice in an office, it was probably the equal of the state capitol that was in Darmstadt for an apprentice as well as school.</span> <span id="s177">The school was not run by the office but they were connected.</span> <span id="s178">One day school, one day office.</span> <span id="s179">One day school, one day office.</span> <span id="s180">So I started that at 14, and then you were guaranteed that you would be accepted for employment in that office.</span> <span id="s181">I know I have the records and I just have to find them.</span> <span id="s182">She kept those records and I was amazed that she still had those.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">END OF SIDE A, TAPE 1 SIDE B, TAPE 1 Interview with Hildegard Lee, April 21, 2010</span></p> <p><span id="s184">KL: We were talking about your new life as a high school student.</span> <span id="s185">Could you describe that arrangement please.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">HL: Yes.</span> <span id="s187">I was apprenticed to an office, called The Landkreis Darmstadt, and I believe it is probably similar to the State House.</span> <span id="s188">I entered there in September of 1943.</span> <span id="s189">I was an apprentice for three years.</span> <span id="s190">I would go to an actual school, with a full school day, in a school, and the next day a full day being in this office to learn office procedures.</span> <span id="s191">That lasted for three years.</span> <span id="s192">I was graduated in 1946 and automatically had a job in the office where I had apprenticed as a steno typist.</span> <span id="s193">I entered there as a steno typist.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">KL: Were you there at that job until you left Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">HL: No, because I left there and I believe that I went for an agency that was a civilian agency that worked on restitution I believe for the Jewish people or for the people who lost property and people who had property taken away from them by the Germans.</span> <span id="s196">Because it was a civilian agency and the name means to “make good” for some damage that you had done.</span> <span id="s197">I was there from 1946 until 1950, and again my position was steno typist.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">KL: I wonder, along that line, what happened to your father’s store when he was taken away?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">HL: I have no idea what happened to our furniture, what happened to the...obviously the apartment was closed or would be closed...I have no idea what happened to any of this.</span> <span id="s200">I do not know.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">KL: And so at the restitution agency, when your time was finished, that was in 1950, is that when you came to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">HL: No, I came to the U.S. in 1952 and I worked for the “Stars and Stripes,” the newspaper for the Occupation Forces.</span> <span id="s203">And I would think that I started there in 1950 because I left there in 1952, in June of 1952.</span> <span id="s204">The supply and transportation director I worked for said “She has performed her tasks cheerfully and competently.</span> <span id="s205">She will soon marry and immigrate to the United States.</span> <span id="s206">Should she desire to work after her marriage, I will recommend her heartily.</span> <span id="s207">She is an intelligent young woman.”</span> <span id="s208">So I left there in June of 1952 and was married in September of 1952.</span> <span id="s209">I did not leave Germany until November.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">KL: You were telling me about your status as a German citizen when you came to the States.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">HL: When I got married, my aunt and uncle suggested, or perhaps insisted, or recommended, that I should not go to America as a German citizen.</span> <span id="s212">For whatever reason, I think they feared what I might face because my husband had already left Germany as an Army sergeant and had gone back to America, and all we knew is that he was going to be discharged from the Army.</span> <span id="s213">So I had no idea - I kept in touch with his sister who lived in Bridgeport (CT) and he always thought we would settle in Bridgeport when I came to the States.</span> <span id="s214">I have the Army orders to be going to the States on a ship but I do not think that I was in touch with him at all.</span> <span id="s215">I do not think there was any correspondence after he left.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">KL: So you came to the United States as a “stateless” person and you took out American citizenship at some point.</span> <span id="s217">[Official ID issued by Stadt Darmstadt Der Polizeipresident on 21 October 1952 shows: “Staatsangehorigkeit - staatios -”]</span></p> <p><span id="s218">HL: It took me either 3 or 5 years and there again I don’t remember...I know it was a long period of time because I had to find work where it didn’t matter whether you were an American.</span> <span id="s219">In fact at the “Stars and Stripes” we had people of all nationalities working.</span> <span id="s220">We worked with English, with French, with Polish, our drivers for the Press cars were usually Polish people, so by then I had been used to working with all kinds of people.</span> <span id="s221">But then when I came to the States I learned that if you were not an American citizen it was not quite as simple to find a job.</span> <span id="s222">So I applied, and it took me either 3 or 5 years before I got my citizenship, and of course I have that paper, because I had to change my name from the old name Richardson to Lee.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">KL: If you wouldn’t mind telling us again about your American citizenship and about becoming an American citizen.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">HL: Yes.</span> <span id="s225">I arrived in the States the first week of December 1952, settled in Bridgeport (CT) where my husband’s sister lived, in a one room apartment, and he went to the University of Bridgeport on the GI Bill.</span> <span id="s226">So those were difficult years but I found work, but I had to get work where it was not necessary to be an American citizen.</span> <span id="s227">I studied for my citizenship and became a citizen on June 15 of 1956 in the District Court of Connecticut inn New Haven, Connecticut.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">KL: And you’ve been in Connecticut ever since!</span></p> <p><span id="s229">HL: I’ve been in Connecticut ever since.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">KL: Are there any things you’d like to add about your life in Germany before you came to the States - something we might have missed?</span> <span id="s231">Obviously you have succeeded in keeping in contact with friends and relatives in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">HL: Yes, I still have my uncle and aunt’s daughter who I grew up with as a sister who is now my age, which is 80, and her daughter, who is in her 60’s that I correspond with.</span> <span id="s233">My niece does not write very well anymore.</span> <span id="s234">She is the one who wrote me that her mother suspected about my father’s death.</span> <span id="s235">But what I remember about the war years is naturally the war, the nights that we were bombed out several times in Darmstadt, and the night that Darmstadt was completely destroyed by fire, by the British air force, and we lost everything that we owned and escaped luckily.</span> <span id="s236">It’s called the “Brandnacht” where everything burned, the whole town.</span> <span id="s237">Those are the years that I remember, speaking of school and business, that were constantly interrupted.</span> <span id="s238">You know, you’d go to school and the sirens would go off, you would either go to a shelter nearby or you would attempt to run home, and that was the end of the day, that was the end of the school day.</span> <span id="s239">So it was the interruption of your normal life.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">KL: It’s quite a story.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">HL: And then of course what I called the Liberation, when the Americans came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">KL: Oh, yes, can you tell us about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">HL: Oh, yes, we still love General Patton who was our big hero.</span> <span id="s244">I remember that.</span> <span id="s245">Things got a little better, and that’s when I started to work for “Stars and Stripes” and got my English.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">KL: Isn’t it interesting that for a German citizen that you would feel so happy with the Liberation, just as everyone felt about the war.</span> <span id="s247">It needed to be over.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">HL: Yes, you see we still lived in Seeheim, again by a family that took us in.</span> <span id="s249">There were four people, my aunt, my uncle, their daughter and I, and we just walked in one day, and said there is no more Darmstadt, everything is gone, and can we stay here.</span> <span id="s250">So we lived there under very, very cramped circumstances, in a little house in Seeheim.</span> <span id="s251">And so when the Americans came, when they moved in, it was almost like - it was an end to this awful life.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">KL: Your story makes it so real for us.</span> <span id="s253">We’[re very grateful to you for telling all of it.</span> <span id="s254">One last thing that you had mentioned, a family that your aunt had worked for.</span> <span id="s255">I wonder if you could tell of that circumstance and the irony of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">HL: OK, the people were a Dr. Paul Wolf and the whole family, a Jewish family, and my niece writes me that in 1935, they moved to Dallas, Texas, by ship, and he had/has a clinic there, and after the war, during the hunger years - she actually says “the hunger years” (“Hungerjahren”) - we would receive packages with food from the Wolfs.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">KL: And that is an irony, isn’t it.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">HL: As you would imagine it was usually the other way around!</span> <span id="s259">But I think that she remembered the year that they actually moved from Darmstadt, 1935, and that they moved to Dallas.</span> <span id="s260">Maybe he had a clinic already there.</span> <span id="s261">This is not very clear, whether he established a clinic there or had a a clinic there.</span> <span id="s262">That part is not very clear in her note.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">KL: Well, that is certainly an interesting end to this story that you’ve told us.</span> <span id="s264">We appreciate your sharing all of these details and personal stories for the Museum’s Archives.</span> <span id="s265">It’s lucky for us that you’ve kept in contact with your family and friends in Germany, and so we have this for the Museum.</span> <span id="s266">Thank you!</span></p> <p><span id="s267">HL: You’re very welcome, and if I can help any further or if you need more information, just let me know.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">KL: All right, thank you!</span></p> <p><span id="s269">END OF SIDE B, TAPE 1, END OF INTERVIEW</span></p></body></html>
