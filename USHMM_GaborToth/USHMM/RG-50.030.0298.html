begin by telling me your name and date of birth and where you were born.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">A: Certainly.</span> <span id="s12">My name is Dov Levin now.</span> <span id="s13">And I was born like Belle Levin.</span> <span id="s14">Belle its means in Yiddish, Bill, animal, so the translation in Hebrew is Dov, but because we were all the time brought up in Hebrew school, Hebrew youth movement, this also, this what many, many people know me.</span> <span id="s15">It is -- I was born in 1925 in Kovno, it's called now Kaunas.</span> <span id="s16">It was capital of Lithuania, because Wilno was occupied by the Polish soldiers and so on.</span> <span id="s17">So, in 1925, it was still a Jewish autonomy, Lithuania.</span> <span id="s18">So, if I would lucky, so I could find my certificate of birth, written in Lithuanian language and in Hebrew.</span> <span id="s19">Maybe one day I will find it, but what is more important for our conversation is that I was one of twins.</span> <span id="s20">My sister was Basya (ph), or in Hebrew Batya (ph), and she unfortunately, perished in Stutthof, during the Holocaust, and after her my, one of my kids Basmat, who is now living in New York, she is named after her.</span> <span id="s21">Basmat, a very cute girl.</span> <span id="s22">And I have to tell something about my parents.</span> <span id="s23">My father was Hirsh Levin, in Hebrew, it's Tzvi, in Lithuanian it's changed the word H is G -- Girsh.</span> <span id="s24">My mother -- he is also from Kovno, my mother came from a small village by the name Retchna (ph).</span> <span id="s25">It is in north, northwest of Kovno, and her maiden name was Wigodel (ph), some write it with a W, some with a V, but her first name, I forgot to tell, that it is Bluma (ph).</span> <span id="s26">Bluma.</span> <span id="s27">Bluma it means a flower, therefore, my second daughter is named Nitzana (ph), it means the crisp before the flower come out.</span> <span id="s28">My son is called Tzvika (ph), on the name of my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: Tell me a little bit about Kovno before the war.</span> <span id="s30">Was it an exciting place to live?</span> <span id="s31">Was there a lot to do culturally, politically?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: When I was a child, I -- for me Kovno was everything.</span> <span id="s33">It was everything because we could find there everything what belongs to the Jewish life, from our synagogue to our school in Hebrew or Yiddish, till many universal things like cinemas and so on and so on.</span> <span id="s34">So we felt ourself as a part of Europe.</span> <span id="s35">Part of, I would say, Western Europe, or Europe, yes.</span> <span id="s36">It was an orientation.</span> <span id="s37">In our house the German language was one of the languages spoken, because my father used to work with German companies, and after Hitler came he changed a little and went to other companies in England.</span> <span id="s38">So, he now house the coming and going people from abroad and what's most important is we have very good connection with Palestine.</span> <span id="s39">Actually my generation, or part of my generation we were dreaming about Palestine like we were there, and the geography of Palestine, I knew better than the geography of our country, of Lithuania.</span> <span id="s40">The same also with the languages.</span> <span id="s41">The Lithuanian language we only had to do it for examinations and so on.</span> <span id="s42">But the daily language was Hebrew.</span> <span id="s43">Hebrew.</span> <span id="s44">Hebrew at the school.</span> <span id="s45">Hebrew in the youth movement, and Hebrew when I make my first date with a girl in the street, we also did Hebrew, and my parents understand Hebrew.</span> <span id="s46">See, I wasn't one.</span> <span id="s47">It was a culture, a part of the culture.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">The -- not everybody was the same kind, but let's say 50 percent of my generation was the same in Kovno.</span> <span id="s49">This time in Kovno, I remember there were many, many shuls (ph), or synagogues, about 40 I remember from there, and I think it was more or less right, a real number, and I attend a Hebrew primary school.</span> <span id="s50">Afterwards what we called gymanasium, it means high school.</span> <span id="s51">I was in Hebrew, and my youth movement was called Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair (ph).</span> <span id="s52">So, we were oriented for to go after we attend our school, to Palestine and there or to be on the kibbutz, or to go to the Techni, Technion in Haifa -- that was my other .</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: Why were you so intrigued or driven towards Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: I cannot understand it now, but it was so natural the same as a I was born Jewish.</span> <span id="s55">So it was a part of all I been, my family, my bigger family.</span> <span id="s56">It was our culture, our orientation, so we took it for granted that so should be.</span> <span id="s57">Even one of my uncles went to Russia, but he was an exception.</span> <span id="s58">His name was Borris Levin, and only this week I met his daughter.</span> <span id="s59">She come now from Moscow to settle here in Scranton, Pennsylvania.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: What -- I'd like to hear a little bit more about the Youth Movement that you were involved in, the group you just mentioned.</span> <span id="s61">What was the basis of that?</span> <span id="s62">What were you taught?</span> <span id="s63">What kind of activities did you participate in?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: You know, most of the youth movements are alike more or less.</span> <span id="s65">They are making sport games and making journeys and making camps, summer camps and other camps, singing a lot, a lot, a lot, and telling stories.</span> <span id="s66">Very nice stories mostly about Israel and about the kibbutzim and making it very idealistic and really for me Eretz Yisrael, Palestine, was like in the pictures, that palm tree with tent and chalutzim (ph), pioneers, are dancing around, sometimes also working.</span> <span id="s67">So that also was the contents of our activities.</span> <span id="s68">We were -- they told us what is the daily life, not in Tel Aviv, like in the kibbutzim.</span> <span id="s69">And that was made by emissaries, shlichim (ph) in Hebrew, which come very often to us, so we knew also the later songs from Palestine and we very up to date what's going there, what happened there.</span> <span id="s70">Sometimes more than what happened in our own country.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: Did they teach you how to use weapons, how to fight if you needed to, any of those sorts of things?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: No.</span> <span id="s73">Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair was one of the few organizations that were socialist minded.</span> <span id="s74">So, the orientation of weapon was only for defense.</span> <span id="s75">So, they talked with us about the shomrim (ph), it means the guardsmen in Palestine that at night they are riding on the horses and that was a .</span> <span id="s76">I remember even the names of these guys.</span> <span id="s77">So, but, it was only a need, but not too much, in the opposite let's say of the Beitar Movement, they were really military oriented.</span> <span id="s78">And I remember in our class, in the Hebrew class, let's say half of the class was -- belonged to Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair, the other to Beitar, so we are quarrelling.</span> <span id="s79">One of the discussions was how do you mean to settle in Palestine, only by buying an acre after an acre ground and to work.</span> <span id="s80">Each country must be taken only by force that the history is in all the countries in all the world, all the times.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">So, we were quarrelling and so on and some times we are also beating each others.</span> <span id="s82">So it was not only in our class, it was like in all places.</span> <span id="s83">The community is divided in many orientations, in many ideologies, but our whole community from the Communists till the most, most Orthodox people like my late grandfather, his name was David Levin.</span> <span id="s84">He was a patriarchic Jew, a very strong man, like in these times.</span> <span id="s85">Not like my father, my father was already another generation, more liberal.</span> <span id="s86">So, this whole community was Jewish.</span> <span id="s87">We cannot remember intermarriage, and if it happens, so everybody knew who is who and it was something.</span> <span id="s88">I remember that also that in our classroom, one girl brought one day -- we were without hats, we were -- it was more traditional but not Orthodox, anyway, when one of my girlfriends from the class, a classmate, she brought a sandwich with butter and meat, so everybody shouts, "Look what's happened, she's eating so and so."</span> <span id="s89">So, the public mind of the class was against maybe the other day she didn't know because she didn't felt herself convenient.</span> <span id="s90">I even remember her name.</span> <span id="s91">It was Tanya Tzvi.</span> <span id="s92">Tanya Tzvi, yes.</span> <span id="s93">And she's still living.</span> <span id="s94">She's in Tel Aviv.</span> <span id="s95">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: So, it was a very religious community?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: Not very, but it was very Yiddish, Jewish minded.</span> <span id="s98">For instance, Shabbat (ph), I think 95 percent of the stores, Jewish stores were closed.</span> <span id="s99">Orthodox, or not Orthodox, or traditional or anti-traditional, only the last years we are accepts, yes accepts.</span> <span id="s100">And only some cafe houses or other places but usually they are closed and it was not an easy problem because for the government we had also had to be closed Sundays.</span> <span id="s101">So, it was lose of two days of earning.</span> <span id="s102">Anyway, so it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: So you're talking about Kovno and Slobotka, the whole area?</span> <span id="s104">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: Which area did you grow up in?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: I grew up in the -- now we can call it the down town of Kovno, but not Slobotka.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Slobotka was a suburb.</span> <span id="s108">You have to cross a river by the name of Viliya (ph), or now it's called Nairis (ph).</span> <span id="s109">In Slobotka were concentrated for many, many years a more poor population.</span> <span id="s110">More poor, some of them very Orthodox but some -- on the other hand there were many people who were Communist oriented.</span> <span id="s111">And that -- anyway I can think that in my classroom only one boy was from Slobotka and it's also because his mother was a dentist there.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: Let me ask you something because you just mentioned Communists.</span> <span id="s113">There were also youth groups that were Communist oriented right?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: I'm just sort of wondering how one chose to belong to Beitar versus the Communists.</span> <span id="s116">What were some of the differences?</span> <span id="s117">Did -- was there any interaction between these groups?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: Interactions were what I mentioned before, it's fighting.</span> <span id="s119">Q: How did you decide to join the group you chose?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: Oh.</span> <span id="s121">Yes, I remember that it was a very deep sympathy for this because they were also scouts and when I was a child I like much to be a scout.</span> <span id="s122">And officially Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair for the government we are calling Jewish Scouts.</span> <span id="s123">Maybe if I would be in another society and my father was be very right, political right orientation, maybe, I was sent or not sent be encouraged to go to Beitar.</span> <span id="s124">I remember another thing that I have quarrels with my parents because I went Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair.</span> <span id="s125">For them it was too left.</span> <span id="s126">Afterwards when I grew up, when I was a teenager, so it was incidents, sometimes instead to go to the synagogue I went to the activities there.</span> <span id="s127">But it was not only my problem, it was a problem for a whole generation and it happens in all the countries till now.</span> <span id="s128">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: What about the Communist groups.</span> <span id="s130">Did you know people who joined those?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: Yes, they were for us very mysterious because the Communist party and the other people were in underground.</span> <span id="s132">This party wasn't allowed in Lithuania, because Lithuania was very much right oriented and what I remember that the -- May, first May we watched many times that police forces are ready for demonstrations and we saw that sometimes red flags at were hanged that night and morning the police made effort to put them down.</span> <span id="s133">Of course as young people we were sympathizing with the Communists, but it was for us very not -- unclear who is a Communist, why and what.</span> <span id="s134">We knew its have to do something with Russia, Soviet Russia of course, but not too much more.</span> <span id="s135">I would not say it was a puzzle for us, but something mystery.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: I think you said that you sort of sympathized when their demonstrations were put down.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Why would you sympathize with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: Oh, that's like a child what -- who don't police, the cops.</span> <span id="s139">Q: Now in 1940, I think, the Russians took over Kovno, right?</span> <span id="s140">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: How did that change your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: Oh, it was a big change, yes.</span> <span id="s143">I remember it was at Shabbat, Saturday, the 15th of June.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">We were in this day in summer camp of Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair and my counselor was afterwards a very known woman, Chaika Grossman (ph) from Bialystok.</span> <span id="s145">She told us this days -- this day but not only this day as she left oriented -- orientated -- girl or young woman escaped from the Russian in Bialystok, and came as refugee to Lithuania because she was a Zionist and she could not live under the Soviets, even, even Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair was very, very much orient -- Soviet oriented, so it was how to tell you, half, half, mixed feelings about Soviet Russia.</span> <span id="s146">And now this Shabbat we heard -- the Saturday -- we heard noise, afterwards I understood that it was the movings of tanks and we left everything and we moved very quickly to house, by foot.</span> <span id="s147">It was about eight miles or so to go back by foot.</span> <span id="s148">And his place was Claiboneshkis (ph).</span> <span id="s149">It's the opposite side of Slobotka but on the Kovno side.</span> <span id="s150">It was a village, a small village and I remember that going home we saw many Lithuanians with angry faces.</span> <span id="s151">Some of them took their guns because they belonged to a semi-military organization called Shaulei (ph), Shootings Man.</span> <span id="s152">So, they wear uniforms some of them, and some took the guns and they were running here and there like something happened and they didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s153">Bur they were very angry and didn't so of course smile to us.</span> <span id="s154">Of course, the opposite.</span> <span id="s155">So I understood that something is going to be wrong.</span> <span id="s156">That is a feeling.</span> <span id="s157">To me as a Jewish boy, boy, I was then 15 years old, yeah, 15 and a half.</span> <span id="s158">So, we came to Kovno, and Kovno was a very like a festival.</span> <span id="s159">People are staying in the streets and making a for the Red Army.</span> <span id="s160">Jewish, non Jewish, all mixed, the crowd.</span> <span id="s161">And I went straight home because to see what happened, and that was beginning of the Soviet era in Kovno that lasted one year and seven days.</span> <span id="s162">For me personally, it was a very bad -- no it was not a bad time, it was also interesting time.</span> <span id="s163">First of all, I was shocked by the closing of school.</span> <span id="s164">Hebrew school was abolished and we have to in the same, yes in the same building we have to learn Yiddish.</span> <span id="s165">I couldn't understand it.</span> <span id="s166">Who is forcing me, why?</span> <span id="s167">I knew all because they were against zionism and Hebrew is like a Zionist language.</span> <span id="s168">We were very against, and the other thing was Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair was abolished.</span> <span id="s169">And on the other hand, it was very interesting time, every second day there was a parade, a meeting, a demonstration with songs, very famous songs, that we -- some of them we heard even before, like "Katusha" (ph).</span> <span id="s170">(humming).</span> <span id="s171">It's -- in Israel it's popular till now, but no more in Russia.</span> <span id="s172">And other songs -- marches --</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: These were Russian songs?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: These were Russian songs, of course.</span> <span id="s175">The French did it in another way, till now, but the Russian song "Katusha".</span> <span id="s176">Katusha is the name of a Russian girl, Katia, Katy.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: What other -- what other changes in terms of people's lifestyles were made when the Soviets took over -- were business closed?</span> <span id="s178">I mean, what -- was it more difficult to be a Jew openly, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: No, not at all.</span> <span id="s180">It's the contrary, now we become really equal citizens.</span> <span id="s181">I could see Jewish policemen.</span> <span id="s182">I was very proud in this, first time, but the same time for instance my father should to work at Saturday.</span> <span id="s183">My father, how my father, but my grandfather was very Orthodox man so they took away him from his store, put in a comissar and he have to sit home and to count his days, nothing.</span> <span id="s184">I'm not sure that he gets a small pension.</span> <span id="s185">I don't know, maybe we helped him.</span> <span id="s186">Till this day he was a well-to-do man.</span> <span id="s187">What you call your middle-middle, but now he become unemployed even though he was about 70-75 years, but still he was every day going to the store.</span> <span id="s188">The store was more than a place for earning.</span> <span id="s189">It was occupation, there everybody came to him and so, and so it was like a club.</span> <span id="s190">And that happened to many people.</span> <span id="s191">So nobody, nobody starve from hunger, nobody, but it happened after things that people were rich had to go out and leave their nice apartment and suites and sometimes also their cars.</span> <span id="s192">Poor people for them it was a better change.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">And for me as a socialist, or socialist-oriented, I could understand it and evaluate it.</span> <span id="s194">Even for my family it was bad.</span> <span id="s195">Another of my uncles was -- he visit twice Palestine and hesitate if to settle or not, now they took all his fabric, what's is -- factory.</span> <span id="s196">It was a factory of leather, a big one.</span> <span id="s197">They were working in it I guess about 35 or 40 workers.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">And one of them became the commissar, he was thrown out, and I understand he was very sorry he didn't go to Palestine with his wife.</span> <span id="s199">His name was Moses Levin.</span> <span id="s200">I have here, I am keeping many papers and forms of his factory till now.</span> <span id="s201">I got them last year.</span> <span id="s202">So, this is an example of a family that something changes the life.</span> <span id="s203">My mother has also to work.</span> <span id="s204">Till then she was a housekeeper like all the balabustes (ph) in our class, also a middle-middle, upper -- no it was middle-middle, enough.</span> <span id="s205">Here she has to work everyday so there were some days that all the family didn't meet because one is working afternoon.</span> <span id="s206">One is working from morning until noon.</span> <span id="s207">And Shabbos -- Saturday we can not also meet like we used.</span> <span id="s208">So it was something new for me but I wasn't too happy about this.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: Let me ask you one question about the different groups.</span> <span id="s210">Now before the Soviets took over, you said the Communist youth groups were really underground.</span> <span id="s211">Did they become more important under that year of Soviet rule than some of the Zionist movements?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: Of course, they become now the rulers, the mayflowers.</span> <span id="s213">Of course.</span> <span id="s214">For them -- especially these people who were sitting for months or years.</span> <span id="s215">One of them was 20 years sitting in the prisons.</span> <span id="s216">They become the commissars.</span> <span id="s217">I remember the commissar was in my grandfather's store.</span> <span id="s218">He was still without hair, you know, because in the prisons they have to cut their hair.</span> <span id="s219">So he was still very new released from the prison and the government gave them new clothes, mostly leather coats.</span> <span id="s220">The commissars, that's the tradition of Soviet Russia from the October revolution and so on and anyway that was the gona (ph), the gona it means it closes.</span> <span id="s221">Also, my father didn't wear more his hat and wear a caskette (ph), we call it, like a Stalin hat on his head.</span> <span id="s222">That what modern, to be a politaria (ph) man and a socialist and so on and so on.</span> <span id="s223">And I remember also me, in -- when I was in the high school, I have a special uniform, so the uniforms they called it "Habits of the Bourgeoi."</span> <span id="s224">No more everybody is wearing what he wants and what you are more closer to the model of study and all the other big shots, such a shirt not too much with a tie.</span> <span id="s225">So the people understood that that is more wanted now.</span> <span id="s226">So, it was a big change but there were many concerts and the cultural life was very, very intensive.</span> <span id="s227">The first time to go to the theater was then for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: Because to go into the theater before, it was a problem to get a ticket in the big theater and here in the Yiddish theater I didn't want to go because it was kiche (ph) and I was not too much involved in the Yiddish culture, except talking Yiddish and reading Jewish newspaper, daily newspaper.</span> <span id="s230">In our city there were about four newspapers, daily newspapers, in such a small city as Kovno.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: Jewish daily newspapers -- all four Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: Yiddish, Yiddish not Jewish.</span> <span id="s233">There was only one weekly in Lithuanian, and that also was made more for political terms.</span> <span id="s234">So, coming back to your question, so please remind me.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: We were talking the -- about how the Communist groups became much more important.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: It was very natural that they become.</span> <span id="s237">It was their time now.</span> <span id="s238">People coming from the underground to the public.</span> <span id="s239">Well, as a members of the Communist party and the people who belong in other ways to this party or to this movement or to this ideology who were before or in prisons or in non-legal situation, they become now big shots, and it was very -- naturally it was very -- everybody could understand it and what happened that some people were far from them, now went to see, maybe one of his family is also between them.</span> <span id="s240">Maybe he will be now helped by them, privileged by them, to get a job.</span> <span id="s241">It wasn't so easy to get a job, because everybody have to fulfill questionnaires.</span> <span id="s242">Who you are, who was your father0, what was your income and so on and to which organizations you did belong and etc.</span> <span id="s243">So some people even they were before bourgeoi, what belonged to the so- called bourgeoi, or it was another name.</span> <span id="s244">Enemy of the people.</span> <span id="s245">Now, if they have a good one of the family who was a Communist and he was not afraid to help them, not afraid, some denied, "Okay you are my cousin, but I know who you are, so please leave me alone."</span> <span id="s246">Some of them helped also and what another thing that we have seen many people that were very rich before and not only they were leaved on their places but they became -- they make even a progress, they are promoted.</span> <span id="s247">So, we were told that even before they paid contributions to the Communists funds.</span> <span id="s248">Or maybe they have them more, maybe they were spies, Idon't know what they were such -- we called them -- how did we call them?</span> <span id="s249">Salon (ph) Communists.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: One more question and then I want to move onto the Germans.</span> <span id="s251">Yousaid -- your organization became illegal.</span> <span id="s252">Did you continue -- did Beitar and some of the other organizations continue but on an underground basis now?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s254">Some of the organizations began to -- no, officially they abolished themselves in order to avoid troubles.</span> <span id="s255">They declared -- some of the Zionist groups or even religious groups who were, who were abolished, I think all of them declared officially that they stopped their work, their activity in order to avoid troubles.</span> <span id="s256">But bit by bit some of the members who were accustomed to meet every day or every few days together continue to do it, and then somebody gave them an orientation that if you want you can do it, but nobody is responsible for you, do it yourself or you won't.</span> <span id="s257">And so they established small cells like before the Communists did it, in the near past.</span> <span id="s258">So, now the Zionists did it and my organization, my youth movement, Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair, I remember that some of them, some of them were meeting each day -- no, not each day, twice a week maybe, to read Hebrew books.</span> <span id="s259">That was activity.</span> <span id="s260">Because it's not forbidden, but not fashionable -- it an understatement -- so they did it.</span> <span id="s261">When I want to join them, they said, "We are too much, no, go look another place."</span> <span id="s262">After that they told me that they were afraid of me.</span> <span id="s263">I don't know why, maybe because I have some friends who were in the Youth Communist's Party -- movement, youth movement called Consomole (ph).</span> <span id="s264">So that they told me afterwards.</span> <span id="s265">Anyway, so Idid -- what I did myself in order to express my feelings, afternoon or at night I come to the, to a new -- through this old building of the high school and stole Hebrew books and brought them home and I was very happy.</span> <span id="s266">Yes.</span> <span id="s267">For me it was like I did what I have to do, what I like to do and nobody -- maybe I can be punished for this but only for stealing but not for reading the Hebrew books, because I also, my old Hebrew books that I got for bar mitzvah and other things I -- they were kept.</span> <span id="s268">We didn't throw them.</span> <span id="s269">I remember also that even the religious was very unpopular and some of us were forced to come to the school Yom Kippur and Pesach, and so on.</span> <span id="s270">We tried to keep at home how we could -- and me I was not so happy with that religion in this time.</span> <span id="s271">I understand it because that is something of all continuity so I did it also, no too much, but I did it.</span> <span id="s272">So I remember Shabbat when our family were together, so sometimes place my father also make Kiddush (ph) and I didn't refuse.</span> <span id="s273">What happened at this time -- yes -- I didn't stop to write letters to Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: You could have gotten in trouble, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: Yes or not, I don't know.</span> <span id="s276">It could be.</span> <span id="s277">The question how they would comment it, the authorities.</span> <span id="s278">Another thing, I also heard the of Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s279">It was very hard, but it was a technical problem so I remember I wrote to one of my friends of the class, my classmates, his names was Amos Rabinovitz (ph), Amos Rabinovitz, that why you will not tell your authority to make better that we can hear it even in Lithuanian Kovno.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: You can probably guess one of the reasons I'm asking you about these youth groups and whether you had to go underground and all of that is because later on you were involved in resistance activities, and I'm wondering if any of the tricks you learned, any of the relationships you formed as a boy were important later on.</span> <span id="s281">Were a way that you kind of developed that helped you and got you interested in resistance activities later?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: Yes, partly, I didn't belong to the cells usually which numbered three or four members.</span> <span id="s283">I told you why and there was no trouble on this, but I knew and also we knew, all the generations, about underground because we were brought up what I told you of Jewish modern history that -- and not only Jewish history but about the socialists or revolutionaries in Russia against the Czar.</span> <span id="s284">So, we knew what to do and we saw many films about this, so it was not very new for us.</span> <span id="s285">But there were some people who begin at this time to publish a underground newspaper in Hebrew, but that I learned not at this time but in the ghetto afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: Okay, let's -- I want to move ahead a little bit.</span> <span id="s287">Do you remember what was happening the day that Kovno was occupied by the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: Kovno was occupied by the Germans not the first day of war, but the third day.</span> <span id="s289">It was Tuesday.</span> <span id="s290">You know what, I felt a little better because the bombing stopped and we have no special shelters so we were hiding ourselves in -- on the stairs between the floors, because it was in the middle of a very heavy building, it was the safest place.</span> <span id="s291">And you have to run, and here and there.</span> <span id="s292">So, first of all was its relaxation, a certain relaxation.</span> <span id="s293">We can go to bed, maybe and we can eat a time more or less that was the first reaction.</span> <span id="s294">We knew that we have not to expect good times.</span> <span id="s295">That we knew very good from the refugees who came to us and from the newspapers I had also knew not exactly but a lot what they did when they came in Poland a year ago and so on and so on but everybody is thinking that to me it will not come.</span> <span id="s296">And I remember that the day before somebody informed us from our house it was my also from my classroom his name is Avraham Yashpan (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s297">He is now living in Rio de Janeiro and told me, "Look, I'm going to escape to Russia.</span> <span id="s298">They will slaughter us."</span> <span id="s299">They, it means not only Germans, but everybody except the Jewish.</span> <span id="s300">We felt that the Lithuanians don't like us, or hate us, better.</span> <span id="s301">We felt it, but we didn't know how much.</span> <span id="s302">So, I told him I cannot leave my family.</span> <span id="s303">Or in other words, so I heard his mother voice through the telephone, "You see Belle is a better son than you.</span> <span id="s304">He's not going to leave his family."</span> <span id="s305">Yes, and this woman by the name of Rachael, or Rochel, Rachel Yashpan, she was in the concentration camp in Stutthof, and I met her after the war near Rio de Janeiro.</span> <span id="s306">She could not come to Palestine for certain reasons.</span> <span id="s307">So we were expecting somebody is going to happen, and it happened very quickly.</span> <span id="s308">I remember from this only two or three things.</span> <span id="s309">One, it come to us, I would call them a gang of five or six people, people from the street.</span> <span id="s310">People with guns or with half-guns or something and they took us to the back yard -- not the back yard but to the -- you know, all the houses were a big place around, so they took us and when we come down, we were living the third floor, we show all the Jewish families in the house.</span> <span id="s311">It means that 90 -- 99 percent except the Gentile are staying in a line and the people come to take us are staying against us with guns and we was very frightened, except when he put, one of them, a young guy put his gun against me.</span> <span id="s312">So I remember my mother told me, "If you turn now he will not harm you.</span> <span id="s313">He knows that you are a good boy."</span> <span id="s314">And they told us they had seen the Jewish people are working against the Germans and against the Lithuanian partisans.</span> <span id="s315">They called themselves partisans.</span> <span id="s316">So, I don't know what happened but we were released to our houses.</span> <span id="s317">When we come to the house we have seen that in my daddy's table, he has his own table for writing, what do you call it shaipdish (ph), so he was missing his golden box for cigarettes.</span> <span id="s318">So, maybe this was their excuse to come here or to release us, I don't know.</span> <span id="s319">I don't remember.</span> <span id="s320">I remember another thing.</span> <span id="s321">I remember the same day we heard in the radio the first order in Lithuanian language, "Nobody is to go out and nobody is to take arms," and so on.</span> <span id="s322">What each army is doing when it's coming into an occupied area, but one, I think it was the last paragraph there, was for each German soldier will be shot, it will be shot 100 Jewish people signed by Colonel Bobyalous (ph), the commandant of Kovno, Kaunas.</span> <span id="s323">He was appointed right now.</span> <span id="s324">And now, let me tell you the same, a year ago when I visited Lithuania as a member of a delegation from the Knesset I met in the parliament the son of Mr. Bobyalous, head of the committee of defense and foreign affairs.</span> <span id="s325">And he should be my host to take me so I avoided twice to shake hands with him, and I didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: That's ironic.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: We were talking about how -- what was going on when the Nazis occupied Lithuania, occupied Kovno.</span> <span id="s330">As I understand it, there was a tremendous amount of chaos, certainly in the beginning.</span> <span id="s331">People were being beaten, killed, taken out.</span> <span id="s332">I don't know if this was something that you saw or experienced?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: Something I saw through the window, and I avoided such things to see, naturally, and I saw through the window, for instance, that a young man is going on the street, and somebody is arresting him or holding him.</span> <span id="s334">This young man took from his pocket a certain paper and showed it to the others -- no I think they told him to go back.</span> <span id="s335">He refused.</span> <span id="s336">That I understood from his movements, and they showed a certain paper maybe it was -- he get it from the Germans, or he worked for somebody already, so they become very angry and took him by the two sides and arrested him.</span> <span id="s337">And what makes me very bad feelings is that all the crowds on the streets, they are trying to make a lynch of him.</span> <span id="s338">So, then I felt it's not only the Germans, but everybody enemy to each Jew, even to people who were not Communists, who were not part of the Soviet government.</span> <span id="s339">It's enough to be a Jew.</span> <span id="s340">So, for instance, my grandfather, I came to visit him because he was living in the more quieter neighborhood than mine, so my parents decided we are living maybe too much in the center of the city, so it's more dangerous so let's go to the grandfather.</span> <span id="s341">The Grandfather was living on a small street called Nomonu (ph) Street, Nomonu 14, I think, and everything was very quiet.</span> <span id="s342">It was a garden on the corner, very idealistic, very quiet, and some day came a Lithuanian, civilian Lithuanian with a rifle and come to see.</span> <span id="s343">So, he told that he is running after people to work, taking them to work.</span> <span id="s344">That was a daily habit.</span> <span id="s345">Jewish people were taken to work.</span> <span id="s346">It was part of a to work or to making them work -- it was part of making them that everybody can see them in bad situation, the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s347">That, for instance, an old man has to go with two chairs.</span> <span id="s348">He's in the middle of the street and everybody is going and beating him and so on and so on.</span> <span id="s349">So, it was much more than only physical work.</span> <span id="s350">So, once such man with a rifle come to take my old, old grandfather to work.</span> <span id="s351">My grandfather refused.</span> <span id="s352">So, he even didn't talk to him Lithuanian.</span> <span id="s353">My grandfather asked me to tell him that he's too old.</span> <span id="s354">So, he told me that he will take him by force.</span> <span id="s355">So, the grandfather told me to tell him that nothing will help, and they can't take him.</span> <span id="s356">So, nothing will -- we will not go.</span> <span id="s357">And my grandfather has experience from World War I that I knew also with all the gangs in Russia when they were deported to Russia by the Czars in the -- during the revolution that each gang who come -- occupies a certain city took people and arrested them sometimes he cruel to them, so, he had very, very good experience of life.</span> <span id="s358">I would not say good, but rich, let's say.</span> <span id="s359">So, he refused, and what happened, in a certain moment I saw two German soldiers are coming with a Lithuanian guy.</span> <span id="s360">Afterwards I was told that a neighbor from the same building saw that the old and very distinguished Mr. Dovid Levin is taken by such a hooligan, to work, he was very shocked.</span> <span id="s361">So far, that her apartment where two German soldiers were put to live there -- it happened in all houses.</span> <span id="s362">It was a custom that in each house had to take some soldiers and they were living there.</span> <span id="s363">She said, "Look they are going to take this old man to work."</span> <span id="s364">So, they come and saved him.</span> <span id="s365">That was very -- I was very impressed by this.</span> <span id="s366">Soldiers, but not Gestapo and not other soldiers.</span> <span id="s367">A private or a corporal.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: All this people that were taken out every day to work, were they really being taken out to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: No.</span> <span id="s370">Sometimes they were taken to only to what I told you, like with the chairs.</span> <span id="s371">But what's more important is that some, a big part of them didn't come home.</span> <span id="s372">They were taken to the Seventh Fort, to the prison, to another place, murdered.</span> <span id="s373">The woman or girls were raped before and afterwards murdered, or by shooting or with knives and so on and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: Now how did you get information?</span> <span id="s375">How did you know this was happening -- at the time, not what you learned later?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: I learned it later.</span> <span id="s377">It could be a day later even because some of these girls told us how they escaped, they were saved.</span> <span id="s378">I remember a name Ella Volpe (ph).</span> <span id="s379">Ella Volpe.</span> <span id="s380">She was also in my age, about 15 1/2, a nice looking girl.</span> <span id="s381">She told us when she was in this fortress, Number 7 or Number 4, I don't remember this, but the other woman took water with sand and put on her face so she will look like an ugly or a handicapped woman or old woman so nobody will hurt her.</span> <span id="s382">That I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: Did it work?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s385">So, she told us you know it was very unconvenient to examine her.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: The people who were taken to the forts and killed, how did you get information about that?</span> <span id="s387">How did you know what was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: As this girl, also others were released -- small, small part, I would say ten, fifteen percent, no more, and they told us very horrible stories.</span> <span id="s389">I remember one of them that they were thirsty, so the Lithuanian guardsmen, also they called himself partisans, he told them, "If you bring me money I'll let you go to have a water from a swamp, or maybe another place also for water."</span> <span id="s390">So, they went and on the way they were shoot.</span> <span id="s391">I heard also that one of our teachers, former teachers, by the name Goldman, he committed -- he fight back.</span> <span id="s392">He told them very hard words, and they shoot him after he showed that he is going to defend himself.</span> <span id="s393">That's what I remember from these times.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: Do you know who was responsible for these massacres?</span> <span id="s395">Was it Nazis, was it Lithuanians?</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: Lithuanians.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: Einsatzgruppen (ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: The word Einsatzgruppen we didn't heard at the time.</span> <span id="s399">We have seen only that usually on each group of Lithuanians who are going to murder or make operation for action, it they called aktzion (ph), were one or two Germans, so the proportion was one two eight, one to ten.</span> <span id="s400">I don't know exactly, but the daily work usually did the Lithuanians except that when we come to the ghetto, it was the 15th of August 1944, so there were the beginning hautios (ph), and the huge population everybody has to deliver everything of money, gold, silver, and other jewels.</span> <span id="s401">So, that was done only by German police force.</span> <span id="s402">They were also very cruel.</span> <span id="s403">They maybe have good -- in their towns they have good training how to do this.</span> <span id="s404">Shoot people in order to frighten the others.</span> <span id="s405">So, this was done only by Germans, not Lithuanians.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: They did not trust the Lithuanians for that.</span> <span id="s407">A: Yes, I think you are right.</span> <span id="s408">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: Well, let's talk about the ghetto.</span> <span id="s410">How did you happen to get sent to the ghetto?</span> <span id="s411">How did you get there?</span> <span id="s412">Were you able to take things?</span> <span id="s413">Was it -- how did this transformation come about?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: First at all, it's funny but it was a good news that we are coming to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s415">Because the feeling was that in the ghetto we will be preserved.</span> <span id="s416">Probably.</span> <span id="s417">We will be only Jewish people maybe it will stop all the -- these horrible things, to catch people on the streets, in the houses and to kill them etc.</span> <span id="s418">So, there we will work, we will do what happened in Poland, so that is and maybe we can survive the war, maybe.</span> <span id="s419">So it was good feeling.</span> <span id="s420">A good feeling.</span> <span id="s421">A good feeling this time, better than before.</span> <span id="s422">So, we had to look after a place in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s423">The ghetto was in Slobotka, the same suburbs, Slobotka, and it was done by two ways.</span> <span id="s424">Or that everybody chose a place and they made exchange with the Lithuanian or Polish family who were living there, or to get such a place from the Jewish Committee.</span> <span id="s425">Meanwhile there was the Jewish Committee which become afterwards, the Judenrat.</span> <span id="s426">We didn't know in this time all the names of the famous people, but we were in connections with the level of officers, working in the offices of this Committee, and they gave us places.</span> <span id="s427">We have to go to the ghetto and we could take everything, everything, and I remember from Kovno to Slobtka were a very, very, very long line of vehicles with everything.</span> <span id="s428">Sometimes also furnitures, and the Jewish had something in the houses.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Everything you went to the ghetto, and it was before the house search, so the Germans couldn't find concentrated, they have not to go from house to house in Kovno.</span> <span id="s430">I remember an episode that we come to the Lithuanian family talking about the exchange, so the it happened that we also had to give them some money.</span> <span id="s431">My father didn't have more money, so he took out the cover of the table, it was a very expensive of a very good linen, with colorful and so on and gave her so, "Here you have it."</span> <span id="s432">I became very sensitive in this time and if I want to cry, because it was for me a very situation of helpless.</span> <span id="s433">So, I interfered and told this lady, "Look, you took our -- most of our furniture, most everything, you have to know how to keep it."</span> <span id="s434">That was my - that I remember very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">She looked at me and cried also she.</span> <span id="s436">I was going to cry, she cried, but she took.</span> <span id="s437">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: Before when you were talking about all the vehicles lined up to get into the ghetto, can you tell me more of what this looked like?</span> <span id="s439">And was it organized?</span> <span id="s440">Did it feel organized or crazy?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: No, it was not so organized, but I felt like gypsies are moving, such views we have seen before, but not so much.</span> <span id="s442">It was four kilometers, four miles we see moving and moving and going and going, and without an end.</span> <span id="s443">And people were looking in the streets.</span> <span id="s444">For me it was interesting how is their reaction.</span> <span id="s445">Pity or the opposite, so as I remember it was not pity.</span> <span id="s446">If it was so it was only several, so I was very impressed by this, by remorse, not.</span> <span id="s447">It was like raining, it should be rain, so everybody is going in this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: Now, did you initially live in the small ghetto or the larger ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: I was in the beginning, living in the small ghetto at a small street called Shiluvos (ph).</span> <span id="s450">And it was right by the fence, by the fence.</span> <span id="s451">I can remember that every morning when I arose, I could see the Lithuanian, so-called partisan, looking through the window, or through the fence to us, and some of our neighbors -- they put us together, it was lack of space, they put several families together.</span> <span id="s452">His name was Beltz (ph).</span> <span id="s453">It was a Russian Jew, Alexander Beltz (ph), a very tall man, a strong man.</span> <span id="s454">So, he went to the soldier, the man who guard, and began to talk to him, make a deal.</span> <span id="s455">"Look, why not you can not bring us some vegetables, something."</span> <span id="s456">I don't know what they did, but it was some of the people began to try to see, maybe it was a examination, what he's answering, because we were also frightened of them.</span> <span id="s457">Some of them were shooting in the middle of the day, middle of the night, shooting in the windows.</span> <span id="s458">Not, for nothing.</span> <span id="s459">It was their power and they could do what they want, when they want.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: Who were you living with?</span> <span id="s461">What part of your family, all of your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: Yes, at this time, all of my family.</span> <span id="s463">With my father Hirshel, my mother Bluma, and my sister Batya or Basya.</span> <span id="s464">We were living together with this old pair.</span> <span id="s465">Old, maybe today I'm older than he was, Mr. Alexander Beltz, and I remember that they were talking about their daughter.</span> <span id="s466">She escaped.</span> <span id="s467">"Has she reached the Soviet's country or not?"</span> <span id="s468">he says.</span> <span id="s469">"Or not?"</span> <span id="s470">Probably she left with her finance or with her husband or with a boyfriend.</span> <span id="s471">Maybe he was not Jewish.</span> <span id="s472">That I don't remember, but this was one of the things that people were talking about in these times.</span> <span id="s473">Many of them come back -- come back after they were not allowed to come in the Soviet border.</span> <span id="s474">Or some were stopped by local gangs, bombers, something happened.</span> <span id="s475">So nobody -- we knew only who come back or who was killed on the way, somebody watched him.</span> <span id="s476">But who reached, nobody knows.</span> <span id="s477">That I remember.</span> <span id="s478">We are talking about now as a father of children, I am very -- I understand it more, so if I could not do, maybe my child will be saved, so it's also good feeling, that I remember this episode.</span> <span id="s479">And it was door exits, same small building another door were living a big family about twelve or fifteen people.</span> <span id="s480">It was not original family, but some survivors, relatives.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Their family was Grodnik (ph).</span> <span id="s482">Grodnik.</span> <span id="s483">I knew one of them, in my age more or less, his name was Baruch (ph), or and we called him Boroch (ph).</span> <span id="s484">Afterwards he come with me to the partisans and now he is living in -- near Aco (ph), Acres, in Israel.</span> <span id="s485">His father was, some of his sisters, sister-in-law, many, many women.</span> <span id="s486">I understood that the males were taken away before, or escaped to Russia.</span> <span id="s487">It happened in many families there.</span> <span id="s488">That already, it was luck of males because also in the fortress, a very certain part of the women were released, after what happened there.</span> <span id="s489">The biggest part of the males were shot there, or in the streets.</span> <span id="s490">Or they went away.</span> <span id="s491">So I think that most -- it was a very, very charcteristic amount of a family, or so-called family.</span> <span id="s492">That many young women with one old man, the father of my friend, and him.</span> <span id="s493">And they were also from several places.</span> <span id="s494">Not everybody were from Kovno.</span> <span id="s495">They are moving, some of were coming from the small shtetl Kovno, maybe there is more safe.</span> <span id="s496">Others were going from Kovno to other shtetl, village, maybe there is more safe.</span> <span id="s497">And so on and so on.</span> <span id="s498">So, in Kovno what we could find it's people -- it was not the original population of Kovno.</span> <span id="s499">I would say that 20 percent were newcomers or already refugees, from other shtetlach.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: Can you talk about what the ghetto looked like?</span> <span id="s501">How -- were you -- was it very restricted, could you go in and out?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: Inside the ghetto, yes.</span> <span id="s503">But, I remember that we have -- because it was the small ghetto was very narrow and we avoid to go near the fence, so we made some holes between one court to another, or small entrance by putting out part of the fence between the court.</span> <span id="s504">And that made us a possibility also to go at night, because at night it was prohibitted to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Yeah.</span> <span id="s506">I remember another thing, also from this house my mother sent me to one of my uncles, this Moses Levin, that maybe it's more safe there.</span> <span id="s507">And I remember that at night, in the evenings, all the people come together like meeting, like in a club and were are talking, lighting a cigarette, and talking, talking, what they were talking?</span> <span id="s508">I remember a lady which was a year before in France and told how the French people received the Germans there, the German soldiers.</span> <span id="s509">Another told about his experience in the Soviet factory -- before he was an employee in their store.</span> <span id="s510">And the Soviets come and told him, "That's not an occupation for a young man, go to work in a factory."</span> <span id="s511">And he -- they were working according numbers and who is making the number it's enough.</span> <span id="s512">I remember the results.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: How -- but you were allowed to meet in groups?</span> <span id="s514">The Germans weren't threatened by that?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: No, the Germans didn't come in the ghetto usually.</span> <span id="s516">Only when they came that it was something, so everybody would hide in the town and not showing himself or trying to be very small that nobody can watch you.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: So, you were surrounded by fences but sometimes you made holes in the fences so that you could move around a little?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: Yes, but from one house to another house, but not from the fence outside.</span> <span id="s519">Q: There were fences between the houses?</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: Yes, like, it was a neighborhood of a suburb, many gardens, so there was a fence between one garden and another, that was.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: So, they tried prevent you from even communicating from your next door neighbor?</span> <span id="s522">A: No, they didn't.</span> <span id="s523">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: Why a fence between every house?</span> <span id="s525">I'm confused.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: Yeah but before the war there were fences, natural fences, like you can see in each city, that is a suburbs they are living like in a village, like a cultural village so everybody has around his house a fence.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: Was there ever a way to get out of the ghetto, itself?</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: Not, not, not at all.</span> <span id="s529">Even to go close to the fence, and now I'm talking about the fence with, not iron, but how do you call it, with the needles --</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: An electric -- barbed wire?</span> <span id="s531">A: Not electric, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: Barbed wire?</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: Wire, yes, but not electric.</span> <span id="s534">Electric, this were afterwards, yeah.</span> <span id="s535">But it was enough because each ten or fifteen meters should stayed another partisan with a gun and only looking for a victim.</span> <span id="s536">Yeah, but in order to go in the other side of the ghetto we have to cross the bridge and there also it was not convenient to do it because there were also a Jewish policemen, so we were not afraid of him, but also a Lithuanian armed guy.</span> <span id="s537">So when we went to the other side of the ghetto, so according the small ghetto, it was a big city.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: And you couldn't go freely?</span> <span id="s539">I'm confused, you couldn't go freely to the large ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: We could, but it was not very convenient to meet this armed Lithuanian with a uniform of the old Lithuanian army.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: But he would let you through?</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: Yes, but he could do everything, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: He could be temperamental?</span> <span id="s544">A: No, he could --</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: He could kill you if he felt ike it?</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: Yes, to find a excuse to do it or without an excuse.</span> <span id="s547">Q: To do what?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: To shoot me, to beat me, to do me everything.</span> <span id="s549">So, I didn't, for me it was very difficult to look at him even.</span> <span id="s550">So I avoid to meet them.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: What about the organization within the ghetto, the sort of political structure?</span> <span id="s552">A: Political, eh...</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: Well, you had an administrative structure, maybe that's a better way.</span> <span id="s554">You had a Judenrat, you had a Jewish police.</span> <span id="s555">Tell me a little bit about how these people got selected, who were they?</span> <span id="s556">Who served in these capacities?</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: I can tell you only what I have seen, in these times I have seen Jewish policemen, and I was told -- so I remember that when we come to the ghetto it should be one or two days before the 15th of August 1941.</span> <span id="s558">We found already Jewish police there.</span> <span id="s559">Some of them were occupied by helping to build the fence and some of them were also staying and working some places, the lines.</span> <span id="s560">The lines of the stores.</span> <span id="s561">There were special stores for Jewish people, already in the city of Kovno, so maybe they are moved to the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Anyway, there were certain places to deliver food, very small homes, very small at the beginning of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s563">So, you can feel, I could feel that somebody is -- we knew that it is a committee so that we can feel that someone is taking care, or delivering food.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Somebody has to do it.</span> <span id="s565">And also, the policemen are, they must have more higher degrees of commanders and so on, so we knew that it is a certain organization which is responsible for the ghetto and this 100 percent Jewish.</span> <span id="s566">But we didn't know how much they can decide, how long, how far.</span> <span id="s567">That we couldn't do.</span> <span id="s568">I remember that one day it was Yom Kippur when many people were praying so we saw that from, he is coming a Jewish man, his name is Luria (ph), Luria, and he's telling, "Look we know you are going to pray.</span> <span id="s569">It's very important for you, maybe also for us, but what's more important is you have stopped to do it and everybody who is in a certain age," he tell them, "You have to come and to work very, very urgent, because Germans demand I don't know how many thousands or so many Jewish workers for their war effort."</span> <span id="s570">Maybr he told us the aerodromes (ph), the airports.</span> <span id="s571">"And you have to do it, I'm sorry that I have to interrupt you."</span> <span id="s572">So, he went from one to another, from one place to another and people really stopped pray except the old people or what the kids and went to the work.</span> <span id="s573">I don't know if the Germans did it special for Yom Kippur or maybe for them it wasn't -- they did it from their point of view, but that's what happened.</span> <span id="s574">So we couldn't understand that this man, everybody shout, "That's Luria," he was, before the war he was a judge.</span> <span id="s575">A judge it -- we had not many Jewish judges in Lithuania, so maybe it was one or two, so he was very authoritatic, he were talking in language of orders, explained very short, that is so, we understood that it's from the Committee.</span> <span id="s576">We called it a committee, the word Elderstrat (ph), we didn't knew yet, but bit by bit we knew it and we have to -- we came to see also the house.</span> <span id="s577">It was in the middle of the ghetto, the big ghetto.</span> <span id="s578">It was a brown house, two floors, but we didn't call not this Elderstrat, and not Judenrat, but the Commitet (ph), in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s579">Comitet, it means committee.</span> <span id="s580">Even till the end.</span> <span id="s581">On the other hand, on their announcements, the papers, it was signed Elderstrat or Chairman of the Elderstrat, so and so, or Secretary of the Elderstrat, so bit by bit we understand also this term, and I remember that in the house of the staff, it was two floors, in one room was a certain -- on a door was hanging a certain announcement, Va'ad (ph) in Hebrew, Va'ad Ziknei Ha'Eidah (ph), it's old name for the Eldest of Zion.</span> <span id="s582">So the eldest of the community it's a paraphrase, so in Yiddish Elderstart and also in German and maybe also in Lithuanian, I saw it.</span> <span id="s583">So, bit by bit we knew that this was the same thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: Did you know any of these people who formed the Consul of Elders or Committee?</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: Yes, we knew it bit by bit.</span> <span id="s586">Nobody come and told us, "You know, we have a committee from this day and so on and so on," but we knew, of course we knew Dr. Elkous, the name.</span> <span id="s587">We knew Yaakov Goldberg, we knew Rabbi Shmulker (ph) and maybe others knew more.</span> <span id="s588">I was only a youngster at this time, so for me it was enough also three or four names, but I knew very much that they are having the rule inside the ghetto.</span> <span id="s589">They are delivering places to work, or jobs, better places, worse places and in order to get a good place, you must have what you could -- what you called protection.</span> <span id="s590">Protectzia (ph), of protectzieh (ph), in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s591">It means to be protected or known by the people who are delivering the works in order to get a better one.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: How did you get protection?</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: It's protection not in the word of a mafia, but if I know that one of the people is working in the office of work, Arbeitzampt (ph), or he was my teacher before or maybe a neighbor or maybe a friend or relative somehow, so go to him and ask him, "Here I am, and it's very hard for me to work in this lousy places.</span> <span id="s594">Please give me another one."</span> <span id="s595">And so, it happened that some people were working very hard, some people less, and what's important that the people who were working hard even could not, or have the possibilities to buy something, or change food for clothes, or clothes for food.</span> <span id="s596">So, if bad is bad at all, if it's good, it's better at all -- more or less everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: Now, some of the names you mentioned like Dr. Elkous, Mr. Goldberg, did you -- what was your feeling about these people?</span> <span id="s598">Did you feel they were taking good care of you?</span> <span id="s599">Did you feel that because they were having to answer to the Nazis that maybe they weren't so good?</span> <span id="s600">What was your attitude about this committee and about the Jewish police also?</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: When we are talking in the beginning of the ghetto, we feel that we are together in one bad position, and we didn't know what we knew afterwards.</span> <span id="s602">So, maybe who didn't get a good job were more opposed, and the others was more pro, but we didn't know that we can expect critical, or vital decisions from the Committee, or the Elderstrat.</span> <span id="s603">They can only execute orders, this time.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: Do you remember what you -- did you have an opinion of them at the time?</span> <span id="s605">Did you think they were helping you?</span> <span id="s606">Did you trust them?</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: More than the opposite.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: Did you know any of them personally, other than just knowing their name?</span> <span id="s609">A: No, I didn't know any of them, nobody.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: Now, you were living in the small ghetto, and very early in the life of the ghetto, the small ghetto was liquidated, correct?</span> <span id="s611">Where were you and can you tell me what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: Yes, it was called also aktzion, not the first one.</span> <span id="s613">So, we were told to move in a certain direction and it was to where the big ghetto, the Great Ghetto, and at a certain place they made a selection.</span> <span id="s614">I don't remember where, probably at the bridge.</span> <span id="s615">I don't -- that I don't remember, because I was in such situations I -- when I cannot help myself I become very introverted, introverted, till now.</span> <span id="s616">But when I decide to do something this other thing.</span> <span id="s617">So I cannot remember.</span> <span id="s618">I remember only one thing, that we moved everybody, all four families, four of my family, we crossed the ghetto together with my friend Bora Grodnik (ph).</span> <span id="s619">He was very upset because he left -- he lost his father.</span> <span id="s620">His father was with a beard, elderly man, maybe also younger than me today, he lost him and he understood what is the meaning of losing.</span> <span id="s621">So he was very upset, but kept himself.</span> <span id="s622">And when we crossed on the other side of the ghetto, we come in in the first house of the street on the other side and come into a Jewish family to rest or something, or to -- I don't know.</span> <span id="s623">They leave, they left -- they allowed us to come in.</span> <span id="s624">Maybe somebody -- they gave us maybe water or tea, I don't remember, something.</span> <span id="s625">I remember even the name.</span> <span id="s626">The name was Sefer (ph), Sefer.</span> <span id="s627">The head of the family was a policeman.</span> <span id="s628">But it was done like solidarity of Jewish people.</span> <span id="s629">"Something happened, come in, live, relax," and so on.</span> <span id="s630">After this, I don't remember how we found another flat, apartment.</span> <span id="s631">That I don't know, but I know that after we were put in another house of the street, Linkura (ph) or Linkuvos (h), yeah, number 56 together with other families in a wooden house.</span> <span id="s632">The house is still staying, one floor, a wooden house, and there was our house all the time that the whole family were living together in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q: It must have been crowded?</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s635">Many families together and at least we got -- yes we got one room and a half of a kitchen together with a family of three men.</span> <span id="s636">I forgot now their names.</span> <span id="s637">They came from Memille (ph), and they were talking between them German.</span> <span id="s638">We knew them before because when my father used to go to this area of Memille-Gebeit (ph), it means the German part of Lithuania.</span> <span id="s639">He was staying in a hotel called Shvartze Adler (ph), the Black Eagle, so he was one of the owners, his wife and a small child.</span> <span id="s640">The relations were not good.</span> <span id="s641">It beacuse first the kitchen, afterwards also the mess -- we didn't become friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">And they were living with us until the big action in October 28.</span> <span id="s643">And the night after they didn't come back, so we earned, earned their place so now we had one room, a small room, but only we, and more than half kitchen, I think, two thirds of a kitchen.</span> <span id="s644">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Davidowitz maybe was their name.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: Did you -- when you were forced out of the small ghetto, when you were forced out of the small ghetto, I know that the hospital was burned.</span> <span id="s647">Were you aware of this?</span> <span id="s648">Could you see this?</span> <span id="s649">What was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: I saw this but I didn't believe.</span> <span id="s651">Q: Tell me what you saw.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: I saw a smoke.</span> <span id="s653">It was at the same time when all the Jewish from the Small ghetto were taken to a big piatza (ph), or place.</span> <span id="s654">And after staying there half a day, we were all released to go home.</span> <span id="s655">It was cold in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s656">That -- it was like it's a repetition of action.</span> <span id="s657">Repetition, yes?</span> <span id="s658">Repetiton.</span> <span id="s659">It means to try how it works and there were many rumors why the Council did this action, or maybe, I don't know.</span> <span id="s660">Anyway, this time we come back we have seen a big smoke, and there was a rumor that this was hospital.</span> <span id="s661">But I could not -- I couldn't understand that somebody is going to burn -- we didn't heard any voices.</span> <span id="s662">I remember even now them -- two floors, the color, it was yellow or white, or cream white of the -- of this building.</span> <span id="s663">So, there were rumors afterwards I heard they were burned and everything, but at the beginning I didn't want not to believe, because there were many rumors, and certain types of the rumors were not true.</span> <span id="s664">So, I also didn't receive this rumor, so I was not very much touched of this, what I have seen, smoke is smoke.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Only afterwards I was told and we also get the detailed information, but it took us several days.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: So, what had happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: Nothing, nothing happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: I mean, what was burning?</span> <span id="s669">I need you to tell me.</span> <span id="s670">Were there people?</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: It was a hospital.</span> <span id="s672">I don't know if the staff or the part of the staff and probably all of the patients including children were burned there.</span> <span id="s673">That I -- maybe I heard this the same day, but I think that I didn't believe, maybe also it's my nature to escape from the reality.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">End of Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: Where we stopped, you are now living in the large ghetto, and I know you were there for a while.</span> <span id="s677">What was life like there?</span> <span id="s678">Was there any semblance of normal activity?</span> <span id="s679">How -- did kids go to school?</span> <span id="s680">Did you observe Jewish holidays?</span> <span id="s681">Were people working?</span> <span id="s682">What was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: I was living after we were expelled from the small ghetto, in what we call the Great Ghetto, it wasn't so great, but, I think we were about -- I was two and half years, two years, or two years -- two and half years, yes.</span> <span id="s684">So, in the two and a half years in ghetto, what we call now the Big Ghetto -- at the beginning I remember that we when we have leisure time, and we have some after the work, or it was a time I should not to go to work, because I was not 17 years.</span> <span id="s685">So, I found a certificate from my high school with a picture of me that I was born this and this year, this and this month.</span> <span id="s686">It means 27 of January 1925, it means that till 27th January 1942, I have not to go to work, because it was the beginning --17 years is the beginning of the first work.</span> <span id="s687">So, sometimes I did, I went to work instead of other people who paid me.</span> <span id="s688">And such arrangement was called, I don't know why, a malach (ph).</span> <span id="s689">A malach, it's in Hebrew or Yiddish, angel, and I was told that it was used during the period of the Czars that people were afterward with the Army and others could replace them for money, so I did it, and so I could help a little bit my family, myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: What kind of work?</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: Oh, work, usually very hard work, field work, or buildings, and we have to under the sky -- it means outside the houses, it was winter.</span> <span id="s692">We were not -- it was very not convenient, unconvinient is also, I wouldn't say the whole truth, in water, in raining, in snowing, in cold, and not eaten.</span> <span id="s693">We were very hungry all the time, to be in the fresh air, young men, so it was no good.</span> <span id="s694">So, anyway, to coming back to your first question, several times we went when I had time to go around the ghetto -- not around but in the center -- like to making a walk with friends or girlfriends.</span> <span id="s695">So, some places in the ghetto became like a promenade .</span> <span id="s696">And as I remember it was around the building of the Elderstrat, or the Comitet.</span> <span id="s697">Why?</span> <span id="s698">Because there come many people to -- for their business.</span> <span id="s699">To get another job, or to move in another house, or to ask for protection, so people met many people there.</span> <span id="s700">It was a concentration of people, a big crowd.</span> <span id="s701">Some of them were talking politics and they were asking for news or talking -- telling or listening for rumors, and there were many, many rumors, good and bad.</span> <span id="s702">So, it was a place to coming and I remember also in this times people like to be dressed also well.</span> <span id="s703">Not as the time when they went to work, so the impression was that people like to be normal as they can.</span> <span id="s704">I remember also during these times it was the beginning of people who were selling some candies, some other things, homemade or other, and that was the beginning of a bigger production of such things in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s705">No, the beginning was cigarettes, people need cigarettes, especially in such a time of tension.</span> <span id="s706">I think that also I begin to smoke.</span> <span id="s707">It was a need, or a fashion, I don't remember well.</span> <span id="s708">Anyway, we tried to be more and more -- like to be normal.</span> <span id="s709">In these times I began also to keep a diary.</span> <span id="s710">The beginning I was writing the headline "Divrei Ha'Yamim" (ph).</span> <span id="s711">Divrei Ha'Yamim, its means the events of the days.</span> <span id="s712">There is also in the Bible there is such a name of -- Chronicles it's called or something, so I -- the first I did note all the events was happened with us, with our family, or with the people of the small ghetto from the beginning of the war till now, and I put also daydreams.</span> <span id="s713">I don't remember about school, maybe it was a school, maybe not, because I was in high school, and high school anyway was not in ghetto, but I heard that there are people who are -- not people but youngsters, younger than me, they are attending to schools, and I am not missing too much because I was -- according for my age I have not to go to school.</span> <span id="s714">So I was -- I should be at the age between school and college, let's say.</span> <span id="s715">That's it.</span> <span id="s716">But on your question, on the spirit of your question, I remember that people liked and also me, to be nice dressed more or less when you came outside the house.</span> <span id="s717">Even we were in the middle of atrocities.</span> <span id="s718">That I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q: Would -- when you say you tried to make life normal, what other ways?</span> <span id="s720">What other things did you do so that you'd feel that in the in the midst of all this you still had some enjoyment, or some control of your lives?</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: Oh, the control of our lives, that was to eat, to eat on the table, even though it hungry to use a knife and a spoon, and a thing what we had to.</span> <span id="s722">And you greet people on the street, and behave more or less as free people, not as prisoners.</span> <span id="s723">Because prisoners have to go on the right side of the street, and we had also to greet the German soldiers and of course the officers.</span> <span id="s724">So we -- and even to make nice our stars that we have to wore on -- here and on the back, in the same place on the back.</span> <span id="s725">So, I remember that people had made it from yellow paper but some did it very nice on all their robes, some of silken and some made it either nice form, bit by bit, so it was a steady form.</span> <span id="s726">Afterwards, the Germans decided shoul be very uniformal, that you cannot do what you want, it should be a special size and so on, but that I remember the trend, to do what we can.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: To maintain dignity?</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s729">I don't know -- dignity, this I don't know nobody thinking, but normal.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q: No, but you're talking about people taking some -- instead of just putting any yellow star on, that they attempted to personalize it?</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: Yes, as part of their guardaroba (ph), I would say.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: What other things did you do to pretend this is a normal life?</span> <span id="s733">What did you enjoy?</span> <span id="s734">Was there music?</span> <span id="s735">Did you have a social life?</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s737">The social life was to meet old friends from the class, or from the youth movements, or new girls and from time to time there were also parties.</span> <span id="s738">Some people were keeping patiphones.</span> <span id="s739">Patiphones its means records or the aparatus.</span> <span id="s740">And dancing or singing or -- and also they worked up this new pairs, from a young boy and a young girl, or it was a continuation from before the ghetto, or they are beginning a newer one.</span> <span id="s741">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: Did you have a girlfriend at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s743">A: Not yet, after that.</span> <span id="s744">I have some.</span> <span id="s745">I would say all, or a big part of my sister's girlfriends were very close to me.</span> <span id="s746">Same company more or less.</span> <span id="s747">After that I had another one till the end of the ghetto, and when I went to the forests, in the end of -- when was it?</span> <span id="s748">The end of 1944, in March, I gave her to keep my diary.</span> <span id="s749">And till now, I don't know what happened to it.</span> <span id="s750">Maybe one day it can be found.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: Were there regular aktzions in the ghetto?</span> <span id="s752">A: Regular?</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Q: Did you normally feel safe, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s754">A: Till the big action, or the Great Action which occurred 28th of October 1941, so were many, so nobody was sure what would happen the evening.</span> <span id="s755">I remember that this time, I remember this chapter in the Bible that it will be a time when in the morning you wish it to be evening and evening morning.</span> <span id="s756">That I remember.</span> <span id="s757">Yeah.</span> <span id="s758">I was thinking about this sentence.</span> <span id="s759">But after the big action, so life become more stable and there were no more such horrible actions, there were deportations.</span> <span id="s760">Deportations it's very inconvenient, very bad, maybe for hard work.</span> <span id="s761">It's not -- it was not surely for deaths.</span> <span id="s762">Many people died there, but it happened not direct.</span> <span id="s763">So what I was afraid is to be caught to dirty walk.</span> <span id="s764">Dirty it's means not dirty aesthetical, but in a bad place of a walk.</span> <span id="s765">For instance, on the aerodrome, airport.</span> <span id="s766">So there you are walking hard, many hours you have to go, I would say maybe five miles each side by foot, and you have to go and sometime to run because it's a very long, Cologne is going on the way, and some are going fast and some not so.</span> <span id="s767">The Germans who are watching press that we have to make altogether to go.</span> <span id="s768">And what I didn't like was to go and to see the people on the streets.</span> <span id="s769">They were so happy I would say or glad, how we are looking and then we were looking bad, very bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: The Lithuanian people?</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: Yes, there was about 90 percent of Kovno.</span> <span id="s772">Maybe some were Polish, I don't know.</span> <span id="s773">But the man in the street.</span> <span id="s774">That I could not stand.</span> <span id="s775">With the Germans we knew before that that is, we were expecting more or less a bad relation.</span> <span id="s776">But the others with whom we grew up together.</span> <span id="s777">So, that was terrible for me, and I -- certain time I worked inside the ghetto as a helper of a craftsman in the internal fac -- it wasn't a factory, but a workshop, a workshop.</span> <span id="s778">So, he was a very old 0carpenter, this man, and we heard about him even before.</span> <span id="s779">He was running a factory of furniture, he and his family, so I become his second or third driver, assistant.</span> <span id="s780">He was not very happy about me because I have -- at this time my hands were not the best and when I have to do something, so I made it not in the best way.</span> <span id="s781">Anyway, I worked beyond a roof, it was winter so it was not so bad and it was warm there because we took the rest of the wood and put it the stove.</span> <span id="s782">At home, it was worse.</span> <span id="s783">At home we had no wood enough, so sometimes we could -- we took the fences from around the house and put this in the oven or even furnitures.</span> <span id="s784">After they were finished, so I prepared to go outside the house all the time, what I can, and only to come in the afternoon, later afternoon, then to have my meal, what's the meal was usually a soup, each time a soup.</span> <span id="s785">In this soup they took everything they could, my mother, in our house it was pieces of bread, potatoes, some grasses, of course water, put together with a little salt and that was the dinner, so-called dinner.</span> <span id="s786">After the dinner we went to other houses to listen to songs.</span> <span id="s787">Or in certain time, I began to take part in the meetings of a new stage of the underground, of Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair.</span> <span id="s788">It was not far from my house, and that was also a turning point for me.</span> <span id="s789">The beginning we were talking of every kind of socialism, democratic socialism, or radical socialism, theoretical things, and what we have to do after the war and what is the best way to become democratic, or undemocratic, many theoretical things.</span> <span id="s790">I remember that I prepared also a paper that say of one guy, Franz Oppenheimer (ph).</span> <span id="s791">Franz Oppenheimer.</span> <span id="s792">He was a sociologist.</span> <span id="s793">So, I brought it and read it or talked it to my other friends, the of Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair, and I remember I was shouting, "Yes I can see immediately that it's not -- it was anti-socialist, this man."</span> <span id="s794">He was probably a social democrat or something so it was not good for Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair that they were still very left.</span> <span id="s795">But one day or night, come to me one of the friends of the people there, Gita Poger, and she told me, "I would like to talk to you very secretly.</span> <span id="s796">You know we are meeting here, we are talking about political theories.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">That was good for before war, now we have to do something else.</span> <span id="s798">What does it mean?</span> <span id="s799">I will not say you but somebody will talk to you and you have to keep it very secretly.</span> <span id="s800">Not to tell even not your father, not your mother, not your sister."</span> <span id="s801">I promised.</span> <span id="s802">Another time come to me somebody, it was her, and with another girl and she told me, "Now we there will be a cell.</span> <span id="s803">I am the commander of the cell and you the both, the two, are members.</span> <span id="s804">I will give you orders and you have to fullfill it and also not to -- even if you are thinking of another of Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair is also involved in these things, you have not to talk with them about this."</span> <span id="s805">So every time she come with new orders.</span> <span id="s806">One day she come and demand that you have to bring her many empty bottles, and here and there and other things.</span> <span id="s807">And what was the most dramatical thing that one day she comes with part of a rifle.</span> <span id="s808">I don't know what it is in English, but it's the part of that -- the shooting part before you have to push it and pull it and everything.</span> <span id="s809">I forgot the English name, because I was never a English soldier.</span> <span id="s810">So it was -- and she brought it in an old newspaper.</span> <span id="s811">It was very dangerous, you know, that if for a piece of jewelry, jewel, you could be arrested and shot, so that was even dangerous not only for me but for the whole neighborhood.</span> <span id="s812">That I remember till today and I am meeting her all the time and I remember, "You, you was my hero.</span> <span id="s813">I was admiring you how you are doing this."</span> <span id="s814">And bit by bit we also have lessons telling you how to shoot, only theoretical and topography and about first aid, how to give, and how to make estimations of distances and a little Judo and many things.</span> <span id="s815">Until we heard that the Wilno Ghetto is liquidated and then we also had also newspapers written by hand that -- I remember that some of the words was the order of the U.P.O., the United Partisans Organization in Wilno, or the first proclamation or the other, it was included in our newspaper.</span> <span id="s816">So, it was very, very important for me, for us, to hear such things.</span> <span id="s817">If they can do it, maybe we can do it also.</span> <span id="s818">So, we were very encouraged from this.</span> <span id="s819">You must understand that nobody know -- we were closed like in a zoo.</span> <span id="s820">And here is something talking about, resistance, really resistance, not only to sing songs and encourage each other.</span> <span id="s821">So, it was very important to us and didn't tell no to nobody.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q: I want to ask you a few questions.</span> <span id="s823">You mentioned that you were taught various things, about first aid or topography or theoretically how to shoot.</span> <span id="s824">Who taught you?</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A: Everybody "she."</span> <span id="s826">This nice girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Q: So the women were very involved in these underground activities?</span> <span id="s828">A: She brought it from others.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: But it was -- but were men and women equally involved in all of this?</span> <span id="s830">A: Yes, yes, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: I want you to say that.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A: The fact is that in the population of the ghetto, in our neighborhood, in our house, also in the organization and the most of the members were not males, but females, girls.</span> <span id="s833">Yeah, girls, they were very young, so we can call them girls.</span> <span id="s834">So, it was very natural that in such a cell there was one man, if I am, I hope, with two girls.</span> <span id="s835">And I didn't ask questions why.</span> <span id="s836">It didn't matter me.</span> <span id="s837">She's my major in this thing and I have very willingly to do all of this, her orders.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: You don't know how she learned how to -- A: No, I didn't ask.</span> <span id="s839">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">Q: I'm wondering if the Jewish police in the ghetto gave any assistance to your organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s841">A: Yes, the Jewish police did it, but I don't remember in which stage.</span> <span id="s842">I know, but not -- I don't remember, those are two things.</span> <span id="s843">It was at time for instance in 26th of October 1943, for me it was a critical day, because I lost my family this days.</span> <span id="s844">It was deportation to Estonia.</span> <span id="s845">At that morning, I -- the ghetto was closed.</span> <span id="s846">Nobody went to work outside the ghetto and I got mission, a certain mission to go in another place, to say a parole, a certain parole, I think that I remember the parole, and they sent me again in another place.</span> <span id="s847">When they sent me, it was the beginning already of the deportation.</span> <span id="s848">And when I passed my home, my building where we were living, our residence, I saw that a truck staying near the house and Jewish police and others, I don't remember who, maybe Lithuanian, or Estonian, or German are coming to take my family.</span> <span id="s849">I was passing very close let's say about ten, fifteen meters.</span> <span id="s850">They have seen me, I have seen them.</span> <span id="s851">My sister was very crying, very crying.</span> <span id="s852">My father was saying, in a position, or in a stride, "Everything is lost."</span> <span id="s853">He saw me and made such (gesturing).</span> <span id="s854">He didn't say it, but, "What we can do?"</span> <span id="s855">Only my mother she make me a strong wink with her eye.</span> <span id="s856">It means, "Go away!"</span> <span id="s857">and that was very, very important for me because yesterday the 26th of October was 51 years after this day, and I was thinking if she would not do it, maybe I would become again a good son and join the family where they are going.</span> <span id="s858">Because I didn't expect that they will be taken, and why?</span> <span id="s859">Because several days before, this my commander come to me and asking me, "I would like to know the names of your father, your mother, and your sister and others in your family and the name of the identity cards, number," and so on.</span> <span id="s860">Maybe she told me or I understood that the families of the underground people will be defended.</span> <span id="s861">So, when I saw that also they are taking I was shocked.</span> <span id="s862">I was shocked, shocked twice, so maybe this agreement that maybe was done with the Elderstrat, with the authorities through the ghetto, didn't work, or maybe another thing, so that's a puncture.</span> <span id="s863">To think that my family they are taken so what makes the decision for me to go further, was this movement by the eye, a wink to the eye of my mother, that mother, Bluma Levin, born in Wigoda.</span> <span id="s864">She did it and it give me a motivation to go farther and even not to look back.</span> <span id="s865">So, I went to the place I have to go.</span> <span id="s866">It was in a certain building.</span> <span id="s867">It was called Blocktzai (ph), means Blocktzey (ph).</span> <span id="s868">And there I had to say a certain parole.</span> <span id="s869">"I want" -- the parole was, "I want to sleep here at night."</span> <span id="s870">In Yiddish it (speaking Yiddish), so the answer was, I don't remember, but now I'm coming to the your main question, I put it already together that in this day -- before this house was staying a policeman, his name was Daniel Billard (ph).</span> <span id="s871">He was a known policeman because before the war he was a very known box-man.</span> <span id="s872">Maybe he asking me the question or another man, so then I realized that the police or at least a part of the police is working in cooperation with the -- with the underground.</span> <span id="s873">That makes me also a good feeling.</span> <span id="s874">And afterwards, I was told to go to the cellar.</span> <span id="s875">I went -- a cellar.</span> <span id="s876">After I come to the cellar, they opened a door on the ground -- no the ground was with ashes or something or small stones.</span> <span id="s877">So, somebody took away the stones and told me to, "Go there."</span> <span id="s878">I fell.</span> <span id="s879">I think that I fell.</span> <span id="s880">So, I remember that some hands catched me and pulled me down and what it was dark, dark, very dark.</span> <span id="s881">I can only fell --only see some fires of cigarettes.</span> <span id="s882">Very in silence, every half an hour was an order, move here, move there, or who wants to eat, who wants to go to the toilets.</span> <span id="s883">I don't know which -- I don't remember which arrangements they made.</span> <span id="s884">Who wants to smoke, who wants drink.</span> <span id="s885">One like with a chain.</span> <span id="s886">I am telling them and he is telling the other and so on and so on and a certain moment we felt that a noise, anoise, and somebody knocking on the iron cover of the cellar, "Ta, ta, ta, ta, ta," and people are calling and answering, maybe they are going to catch us and somebody telled them.</span> <span id="s887">They are still looking for people for deportation because in this day, many were hiding with me, but we made it an organized form.</span> <span id="s888">So, I felt myself better.</span> <span id="s889">I don't remember if somebody had arms or not, but I felt so secure and so good that somebody is taking care on me.</span> <span id="s890">And really, after a few minutes, everything settled maybe and silent again.</span> <span id="s891">We were not -- I don't know because I don't remember if I looked of -- in my watch.</span> <span id="s892">I have yet my watch.</span> <span id="s893">My watch that I get -- I received as a bar mitzvah.</span> <span id="s894">And when we had to come out it was already evening.</span> <span id="s895">In October the evening began early like now.</span> <span id="s896">And we were told that now everybody is going for a while with family, "You are free but you have to come back very soon.</span> <span id="s897">Maybe this night we are leaving the ghetto."</span> <span id="s898">Leaving the ghetto, it means to the forest.</span> <span id="s899">I become again very happy.</span> <span id="s900">So, I went to home, home was empty without people, without my parents, without my sister, nothing.</span> <span id="s901">And I have seen that some -- the neighbors, next door neighbors of my family by the name of Feen (ph) they were very surprised to see me, "How come you back?"</span> <span id="s902">because they were sure if my family was taken so also me.</span> <span id="s903">And they gave me some to eat and to drink.</span> <span id="s904">We were not in the best relations, but now we become very close.</span> <span id="s905">But I realize that many things are not in the same place, so maybe my family took it, or maybe they took it, I don't know.</span> <span id="s906">But it was for me -- I didn't care because if I are leaving the ghetto this night it's for me all the same, and I took some sandwiches they gave me.</span> <span id="s907">I didn't tell them, but I told them that I will not more live here in this place.</span> <span id="s908">I'm going away.</span> <span id="s909">Maybe they understood, maybe not.</span> <span id="s910">And when I come back to the place of concentration, it was in another hiding place on Stesbolyu (ph) so we were told that this night nothing will happened and we have to stay.</span> <span id="s911">We have to stay, so we decide to not to go more home.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">Because what's home?</span> <span id="s913">Home without parents is no home, or sister, no home.</span> <span id="s914">So, I was not the only one who was in such a situation.</span> <span id="s915">There were more, three, four, five, six.</span> <span id="s916">I don't remember.</span> <span id="s917">So, we stayed in the same place and we sleep in the same place.</span> <span id="s918">We made arrangements to sleep.</span> <span id="s919">It was not in a cellar but under a roof of a small building.</span> <span id="s920">So, it was space for everybody and actually this was the beginning of a collective or a kibbutz, if you want, of a part of a members of Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair and the others.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">Collective or kibbutz I don't remember the name but that was the reality.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Q: Now you said there was just a handful of you there?</span> <span id="s923">I'm trying to get a sense of how many people were together at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s924">A: I think 25 but not everybody were left without parents.</span> <span id="s925">Some of them prepared to be there together.</span> <span id="s926">You know, the feeling to be together it make also the people stronger.</span> <span id="s927">Together, together, only to be, to be.</span> <span id="s928">Now only some hours ago we were saved together, now we will live together.</span> <span id="s929">Maybe we will have to go to the forest together.</span> <span id="s930">Nobody knows.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: I just want to go back to one thing that you said when you learned that the policeman was aware of all of the -- or was aware of some of the activities and probably was helping.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">What was -- do you remember the question he asked you?</span> <span id="s933">What tipped you off?</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: I didn't get your question.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q: You said there was a point after your family was taken away where Jewish policemen asked you a question and that indicated to you that he knew about your activities.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: What was his question?</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: What do you need?</span> <span id="s939">It was a part of the parole, it was a question and a answer.</span> <span id="s940">More or less, what do you need?</span> <span id="s941">I told him I --.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q: If you could just start over and say the policeman asked me, because my question will bw edited.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: The policeman was a uniformed policeman asked me a question that probably it was a part of the parole, the first part, "What do you need?"</span> <span id="s944">So my answer was, "I need here to find a place for sleep this night."</span> <span id="s945">In Yiddish it sounds other (speaking Yiddish), or (speaking Yiddish).</span> <span id="s946">So then, he understood and he showed me where to go in the cellar.</span> <span id="s947">Yeah.</span> <span id="s948">And afterwards, there was many such cases that an open cooperation between the policemen and the organization, but sometimes this policeman also to fulfill orders for the Judenrat, for the Elderstrat in order to deport people and so on.</span> <span id="s949">The policeman who took part of expelling or of deporting my family, I remember very good, because afterwards he was also a part of our organization.</span> <span id="s950">It was not in the middle of the organization, but he used to come to our kibbutz, what we called, and I told him, "You know you are the man that took my family."</span> <span id="s951">So he told me, "Oh, why didn't you didn't say that?"</span> <span id="s952">I'm not sure that if I would say him thats could help but what happened to him, he also perished afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Q: Do you know of any other examples of police helping or the Judenrst helping the underground organizations?</span> <span id="s954">Other ways?</span></p> <p><span id="s955">A: I know many, but I remember very, very significant thing.</span> <span id="s956">When I have to leave -- not when I have, when I was allotted to leave the ghetto with all the ammunition and everything, at March 1944 at night through the gate of the ghetto, so at the gate of the ghetto were some people who were staying there all the time, all the -- even before and after, including they were some policemen, and they knew we were not going as it was reported by one of us that we are going outside like a team of work in the woods, but we are going to fight with partisans.</span> <span id="s957">At this moment I saw also that these tremendous cooperations and the one moment the lights, it was electric were off.</span> <span id="s958">It was very dark, so even the German soldier or watchman could see something so it happens so that the conditions become very bad for realize who is who.</span> <span id="s959">And that was done with a policeman there.</span> <span id="s960">Maybe there were more than one.</span> <span id="s961">Not only policeman, but also some officers of the Judenrat or Elderstrat.</span> <span id="s962">They were staying day and night at the gate and controlling the people who come to work and again and back, especially the people from Arbeitzant (ph), it was a work department.</span> <span id="s963">So, that I was sure -- so that I also saw, not that I only knew.</span> <span id="s964">Probably I was -- I knew about this before, it were rumors that somebody is going to help us and they had helping.</span> <span id="s965">We knew this, but here I saw myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Q: It must have been very encouraging?</span></p> <p><span id="s967">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s968">No, but I was very encouraged.</span> <span id="s969">I didn't think too much of this.</span> <span id="s970">I was one step outside to the ghetto to the forest, so it's like going from the hell to paradise.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">Q: I want to ask you a couple more questions and then I want to hear about your escape and your life in the forest.</span> <span id="s972">Did you have -- within the ghetto, did you have any special assignments or roles within the underground movement?</span> <span id="s973">Were there certain things that you had to do, to perform?</span></p> <p><span id="s974">A: Not something.</span> <span id="s975">I was a private.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q: But did you deliver messages, did you go and get supplies?</span></p> <p><span id="s977">A: Yes, so that was very natural everything I did -- even I didn't remember them.</span> <span id="s978">But what I remember that I took all this very, very, very seriously to fill out well done job because it's a holy thing and I am devoted for this.</span> <span id="s979">Yes -- I was thinking that after all this, no -- this organization belongs, maybe everybody belongs to this organization and there somewhere is sitting general staff, with maps and everybody's giving orders and they knew much better than me so I only have to fullfill.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">Q: But what were the orders that you followed?</span> <span id="s981">What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s982">A: What I have done, I remember I brought bottles, another day I brought also to bring money.</span> <span id="s983">Bring money.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Q: From where?</span></p> <p><span id="s985">A: So I tried to sell something from a house and instead to buy bread or other food, I give it.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Or to go from one place to another place, or maybe to also steal some things for this organization.</span> <span id="s987">I remember now, lamps, electrical lamps, even used, they told to collect them and I knew that it's for make small bombs or grenades, primitive.</span> <span id="s988">Such things.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">Q: You mentioned that you kept a diary.</span> <span id="s990">Do you think a lot of other people at this time were keeping diaries?</span></p> <p><span id="s991">A: If you're asking me if I think, no.</span> <span id="s992">Q: You know?</span></p> <p><span id="s993">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">Q: At the time were you aware of --.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">A: At the time I didn't know.</span> <span id="s996">Nobody told me because people doesn't -- didn't tell too much because that can be -- that can be dangerous for somebody if it would be found, nobody knows if it's good for him or for his family and maybe it's also not good because now his family will know -- so, no, it was very, very privately.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">Q: Now you know, I mean, I've looked through the Kovno ghetto diary by Mr. Torey, were a lot of other people keeping diaries as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s998">A: Yes, a lot.</span> <span id="s999">For him it was very easy because he --.</span> <span id="s1000">Q: I need you to say Avraham Tory.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">A: Avraham Tory, that his former last name was Golup (ph) and he was the secretary of the Judenrat or Elderstrat, according my knowledge, for him it was very easy to keep a diary for one side many, many information and also documents.</span> <span id="s1002">He had sometimes only to copy them in the -- put in his diary.</span> <span id="s1003">On the other side he should have had more places to hide them because everybody knows that he's writing and that it was for his daily work, so he had not to be so keeping in silence because nobody would interfere with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">End of Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Q: If you can just very briefly repeat to me what it was that the Jewish policeman said to you that indicated he knew what was going on so that I understand that word parole.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">A: So change the word parole and password.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">Q: You can say parole or password, but I need you to begin by saying the policeman.</span> <span id="s1009">It's a full sentence.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">A: So, the policeman who were a very close to the entrance on their Block C or Block Tze (ph) as we called it, I knew him before.</span> <span id="s1011">I knew even his name.</span> <span id="s1012">His name was Daniel Billard (ph) and his question was (speaking Yiddish), it means, what do you need here?</span> <span id="s1013">I understood I knew it before that this is the beginning of a password, we called it parole.</span> <span id="s1014">So, the answer on this password, or the parole was, "We have -- we get here or we have here to sleep this night."</span> <span id="s1015">In Yiddish it sounds (speaking Yiddish) mir or I, I don't remember well, anyway to sleep here, so he was satisfied because this was the true parole and he let me in to come and maybe show me also the way to go inside or in the cellar that I don't remember very good but afterwards somebody opened a cover on the ground and they also to put away the stones that were under this cover and I felt that I am falling down, down, down, until several hands caught me and they bring me to a place to a certain room.</span> <span id="s1016">It was dark there, that what I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q: The other question I have is, I assume there were also Communists cells or other groups and I'm wondering if you -- the different groups worked together or if they had separate responsibilities in terms of helping people get supplies or get out of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1018">Do you know -- what did you know about that at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">A: At that time, we knew that we are not the only, that the other groups were organized.</span> <span id="s1020">We called them several names one name was the Communist or the Mushtas (ph), because of Joe Stalin.</span> <span id="s1021">Ofdevantzes (ph), or Coatkes (ph), Coatkes means short jackets, overjackets, coats, but short.</span> <span id="s1022">But we knew that they doesn't belong to us, they belong to the left-left and some of them we knew even before the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1023">Some change their places, come from the Zionists to the Communists and why?</span> <span id="s1024">Because as we understood, they are more than we.</span> <span id="s1025">They are a lot.</span> <span id="s1026">And one of them it was very known his name was Chaim Yellin (ph).</span> <span id="s1027">He was a very known figure even in all the ghetto, even outside the organization.</span> <span id="s1028">We knew also or maybe we had the feeling that they has the best connections outside with the partisans and probably I was told, probably it was my feeling, but we knew that they are the prominent people in the organization or their organization is more important than ours in the terms of communication with outside.</span> <span id="s1029">We knew the partisans can be only Soviet partisans because other partisans will not deal with us.</span> <span id="s1030">And if Soviet partisans, it's Communists, so again, so they felt themselves very strong in the ghetto even to be a Communist in this time was very dangerous for the Germans and for the Lithuanians because several times they were looking after such people in order to arrest them and to kill them.</span> <span id="s1031">But in the ghetto it was like in autonomy everybody could -- it was like a big shelter in terms of politics.</span> <span id="s1032">So, they felt themselves very good and very secure.</span> <span id="s1033">Even more when we had to go to the forest, so it was a rumor between us that they are having a preference to go and also their girls, or girlfriends, or wives will get a better -- a better position, or they had not to wait so long as our girls.</span> <span id="s1034">And I will not forget one thing that one of our girls, were organized in Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzai, we were living this time already in a communa, in the collective, it was -- the name was Mildos (ph) 7, because the street was Mildos and the number of the house was 7.</span> <span id="s1035">So it was called Milda 7 everybody, not everybody, but many knew that that belonged to Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair.</span> <span id="s1036">The Communists have also their house not far from us and also ABC, Abetze (ph) Irgun L'Tzion (ph) has their house.</span> <span id="s1037">So, the developments of all the houses was similar.</span> <span id="s1038">People were alone without parents, without families, decide to live together and it was also convenient for the organization.</span> <span id="s1039">Everybody can catch all his -- all their members at one time and they have control and they can also hide their arms and make training with arms, so it was good for everybody.</span> <span id="s1040">So, I'm coming back to one of our girls which belonged to Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair, her name was Rosa, Rosa.</span> <span id="s1041">She was already taken to the gate in order to be included in a group -- I don't remember the number of the group -- going by truck to the forest.</span> <span id="s1042">She was taken away at the last moment, and instead her was put in a girl of the -- what we called them Communist and they are calling no or even the ghetto they have a cover name.</span> <span id="s1043">It was called Anti-Facists Fight Organizations.</span> <span id="s1044">So, they have a preference and when we come, I come to the forest I found a lot of people who belonged to their organizations and of -- from us were only I think eleven or twelve with one, only one girl.</span> <span id="s1045">For girls it was generally more difficult.</span> <span id="s1046">It's because the high command of the partisans is Ruditsky, or Rudniky for us, demand they give preference for men, male good who trained not with revolvers but with long rifles, long rifles mean long arms and better males than females.</span> <span id="s1047">The ghetto organization had another pressure to do what they demand.</span> <span id="s1048">So, it all the time were compromise, here, there.</span> <span id="s1049">Anyway, the last decision that - - the factor let's say, was that most of the girls, Jewish girls and these detachments, and I am talking about the detachments, Kovno detatchments in the Ruditsky Forest which was called this to the German occupants that most of the girl did belong before to the Communist circles or what was called Anti-Facist Fighter Organizations, that is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">Q: Were the non-Communists organizations more effective with working with the Jewish community in terms of getting supplies or hiding spaces or money or anything than the anti-facist organizations.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A: The Zionist organizations, and there are several, one of them it was very big, it was -- Q: What about the Zionist organizations in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">A: The Zionist organizations, and I am talking mostly about their underground organizations because there were many organizations like parties, but they belong to more adult people, but talking about the youth movements, the Zionist youth movements of -- in the Kovno Ghetto, we are talking about three main organizations.</span> <span id="s1053">It Irgun Brei Tzion (ph), organization of bright young braves, any way now we would call them general Zionist.</span> <span id="s1054">It included also religious Zionists, liberal Zionists and so on, that's one.</span> <span id="s1055">The other was what I mentioned before Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair, and Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair with the time where we coordinated with Ha'Chalutz Ha'Tzair, or Dror (ph).</span> <span id="s1056">It was more or less also ideological very close.</span> <span id="s1057">So they afterwards established the collective of the kibbutz together.</span> <span id="s1058">What I mentioned Mildos Sheva (ph), Mildos 7 was together.</span> <span id="s1059">I would call it in one word the --as it means the labor camp of the Zionists.</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">Q: I need to understand something.</span> <span id="s1061">What you're telling me is that most of the underground in the ghetto was young people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">A: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">Q: What about people who were 30 years old?</span> <span id="s1064">A: Thirty year old, they're very on the border.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">Q: Will you say just as a complete sentence that the underground in the Kovno Ghetto was young people, if you can just make a statement like that and then continue.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">A: Continue, or come back to describe -- maybe it's too complicated what I'm talking about.</span> <span id="s1067">Q: I think what you can is that the underground -- because I don't think people know this -- was really young people and that if you then kind of go and say the Zionist organizations maybe had better cooperation with the community, or I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">A: I am coming to this, but first of all, it's important to describe who they are, who they were.</span> <span id="s1069">So, we are talking about underground in Kovno Ghetto, maybe also other ghettos,we are talking mostly about young people.</span> <span id="s1070">Young people it means maybe from 15, 16 till 30.</span> <span id="s1071">If they were more,they were exeptions.</span> <span id="s1072">And I will tell you who were the Zionists.</span> <span id="s1073">They were divided into three or four groups.</span> <span id="s1074">They were the general Zionists and the organization was called Abetze, Irgun Brei Tzion (ph).</span> <span id="s1075">In this organization were also included some of religious Zionists, Bnei Akiva (ph).</span> <span id="s1076">After -- the other was Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair, and they with a time unified with the Dror or Ha'Chalutz Ha'Tzair.</span> <span id="s1077">It also left workers' organization.</span> <span id="s1078">They were very, very close ideologically, and they established the collective or the kibbutz called Mildos Sheva (ph), Mildos 7.</span> <span id="s1079">Sheva, it means seven in Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1080">We used very much to talk Hebrew also in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1081">Therefore I am mentioning sheva, so it's important; it reminds me.</span> <span id="s1082">The other group was Beitar.</span> <span id="s1083">Beitar and other people were incorporated in this ideology that's three.</span> <span id="s1084">And probably we can also include to this organizations Brit Tzion (ph), were adult people let's say from 30 till 60 or more.</span> <span id="s1085">It was an organization who helped the Abetze, who were young people.</span> <span id="s1086">So, if talking about young people about the really underground organization who were prepared to do more or less everything then we are talking about organizations.</span> <span id="s1087">The ABC, Abetze, not ABC, Irgun Brei Tzion, Ha'Chalutz Ha'Tzair and Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair, and Beitar -- they were very involved in the life of the ghetto because their establishment of the ghetto was also Zionist.</span> <span id="s1088">If you will take Dr. Elkous and his deputy of the Elderstrat, Leib Garfunkel (ph) and the others were former activists or top members or leaders of the Zionist organizations in Kovno before the war.</span> <span id="s1089">So, it happen so also the staff of the Elderstrat in all of officer were sitting people more Zionists than all the others.</span> <span id="s1090">So that it was natural that they could help with many things their organization, the underground organization, with money, with means, with transportation, and what's most important, with covering them.</span> <span id="s1091">I mean, the police.</span> <span id="s1092">The Jewish Ghetto Police.</span> <span id="s1093">I remember that our organization, also we sent some of our members to be organized in the police in order that they can help us, they can tell us what is going and so on and so on.</span> <span id="s1094">Even there was one, two, or four people who belong to the Communist organization who also sent to serve in the police, in the Jewish Police in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1095">Anyway, the partition of work became so, or it happened without our planning so our planning was the Zionist organization were more active in the ghetto because they are close to the Elderstrat, they know many things they can get help on the other side.</span> <span id="s1096">The Communist, the Anti-Facist Fight Organization they have very good connections with the outside, with the partisans, with the Communists outside the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1097">And so it was a very good combinations between the two big parts, contra parts of one big organization with that they should have one roof in a certain place it was called, in a certain time it was called the MTC it means Military Technical Commission.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">Q: When was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">A: Oh, it was in 1943, in this time when the topic of going to the forest was very, very -- had become very hot.</span> <span id="s1100">So, it was natural and it was also coordination between the two big parts.</span> <span id="s1101">It was a coordination until a certain point.</span> <span id="s1102">For instance, who will go if it will be in each group?</span> <span id="s1103">Each group, a certain group is able to take 20 people, who will be the 20?</span> <span id="s1104">So it -- maybe it was a key, it was called a political key or organizational key, 15 from this side and 5 from this side, and if girls, so the most girls were from the Communist and we took it for granted that it cannot be others, this is, and they were begging, I don't know how it was done but we could feel it and even when I have to go, so I could not go with others, I have to wait.</span> <span id="s1105">I remember there was a group which left before me from Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair and Ha' Chalutz Ha'Tzair, they left, I guess, in January 1944.</span> <span id="s1106">I have to wait another two months.</span> <span id="s1107">It was also a question with rifle.</span> <span id="s1108">Who will give me a rifle.</span> <span id="s1109">I cannot go in the street and buy it.</span> <span id="s1110">So, I decide very easily to sell my watch, my hand- watch, I remember even the firm, it was Tiso (ph).</span> <span id="s1111">I saved it for bar mitzvah for my Uncle Moses and I gave it to a certain man.</span> <span id="s1112">He brought me money, I give the money my - - the activist of Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair, I remember the name, his name was Eli Rausuk (ph), and one day he told me, "It's settled.</span> <span id="s1113">When you go, you will go with a rifle."</span> <span id="s1114">Of course I was very happy.</span> <span id="s1115">Other things like boots, high boots, because without high boots you cannot go to the forest.</span> <span id="s1116">It's like arms.</span> <span id="s1117">He went with me this guy, Eli Rausuk, like a big brother or like a father, until we got two good boots fit for my legs, for my feet.</span> <span id="s1118">And afterwards, he went with me to a tailor in order to make for me an overcoat also, half to here, because you cannot go with a long coat in the forest and so on and so on.</span> <span id="s1119">And also equipment and everything.</span> <span id="s1120">He went with me mostly to the workshops in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1121">Also, the management of the workshop was helping the partisan organizations, and the coordination, we understood that it was made in the high level between the management of the workshops the organization -- underground organization and somebody in the Elderstrat or the Judenrat.</span> <span id="s1122">Anyway, when I went to the forest, I was very good equipped.</span> <span id="s1123">Also, with cigarettes and tobacco and with underwear and with a rugsack, a sack to put my things, a raincoat and even with a white shirt, no not shirt, a white -- you know, in order to -- a white manufacturer, I would -- in order to use it when we are going in an area of snow so we could very nice to make all camouflage.</span> <span id="s1124">It was -- they did the best.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">They did the best, and it also give me a very good feeling that somebody is taking care on me because I was alone, without family, without nothing.</span> <span id="s1126">And I have also to mention a party before this in our collective, singing songs and drinking even vodka but of course they told we have to accustom ourselves to the life in the partisans.</span> <span id="s1127">And I remember one or two people come from the forest, from the groups who left before and come to make us -- to give us instructions how to behave.</span> <span id="s1128">With arms and with other things, and also how to use a password, we called it a parole.</span> <span id="s1129">And some was in Russian, not everybody knew the Russian language.</span> <span id="s1130">We knew more or less, but in order not to be lost, and also that a good partisan must to drink vodka, not to be an exception.</span> <span id="s1131">He have to accustom himself with all the life.</span> <span id="s1132">And they gave us a lot of advice.</span> <span id="s1133">How to handle when it happens so, and when it happens so, what to do, and afterwards these two guys took us to the forest and they become our guides.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">Q: Now, I want to hear all about that escape to the forest.</span> <span id="s1135">So, I want you to tell me -- actually I'm thinking of one other question and maybe you can make the answer brief, but I know in the beginning I think this important, I know in the beginning you were operating in very small cells.</span> <span id="s1136">Nobody knew what anybody else was doing.</span> <span id="s1137">There were three, maybe five people.</span> <span id="s1138">All of a sudden you're in a commune.</span> <span id="s1139">At what point in time did all of this change and how?</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">A: After the 26th of October 1943 when we meet a big number of the organizations, not one, met together in the hideout, in the Block C after we could make lights in the evening, so we saw many people I know one body, somebody knew me but we're from different organizations.</span> <span id="s1141">And from then, it was no more secrets.</span> <span id="s1142">We kept other secrets, where we were hiding, arms and so on and some but the belonging to the organization was no more secret.</span> <span id="s1143">Of course we kept many things, when we are going, and other things, and our destination, our direction, even we didn't know exactly, only the last two days we were kept in a certain place, and then we get the last instructions.</span> <span id="s1144">From there we could not go back home.</span> <span id="s1145">It wasn't home it was a kibbutz, no more, and then we were given, very secret things that if you are lost and you are alone what do you have to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">Q: So, how did you get out of the ghetto?</span> <span id="s1147">Try to remember and describe for me your escape from Kovno.</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">A: Oh, I will never forget it in my life, because I-- our coming out was postponed several times and we become -- I would say, nervous or maybe it will not fulfilled because it was like a dream, like a dream, and a good dream.</span> <span id="s1149">So one or two or some hours we have to wait again and to come again.</span> <span id="s1150">I don't know what happened and why, but I trust the organization like it would be God, for a religious man.</span> <span id="s1151">So, it comes the moment when they call, "Okay, now you have to go to the tracks."</span> <span id="s1152">They prepared us, I think, with numbers that not altogether will climb, and so it will not make disorder there.</span> <span id="s1153">So, on the track, I saw two soldiers, German soldiers with uniform, maybe they belong to the police or Wehrmacht.</span> <span id="s1154">After a few minutes I realize these are two from our group, and they make like they would be our escorts.</span> <span id="s1155">So, I had really to admire organization.</span> <span id="s1156">If they are so clever, so sophisticated that they can prepare everything, so I hope it will be everything good.</span> <span id="s1157">And we heard that somebody's asking questions at the gate, police or other and then at certain times electricity was short, closed in order to make that nobody can watch us and so on and somebody was asking, "Where are you going?"</span> <span id="s1158">so another voice answer, "Yes, these men are going to work in the brigade of Baptai (ph)," a certain place where Jewish use to work there, hard work.</span> <span id="s1159">And we moved.</span> <span id="s1160">They all begin to walk and we felt more than happy, but in a certain place not far from the ghetto the truck was stopped.</span> <span id="s1161">What happened?</span> <span id="s1162">We have to be very quiet.</span> <span id="s1163">Not to questions or nothing, and what's important, not to take with us things that can make evidence that we were Jews from the ghetto, other Jews.</span> <span id="s1164">For example, I have to leave the pictures from my family and from me of course, many things and not one word written in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1165">If I would be religious so I could not take with me , no, nothing.</span> <span id="s1166">So I'm coming again when the truck stopped and we hear again voices, here and there, talking Lithuanian, talking Russian.</span> <span id="s1167">After a few moments somebody saw a big sack with -- that was about ten or fifteen rifles.</span> <span id="s1168">I don't remember how it was -- how I get one of them, but I did and by this moment or maybe before, we had a commander and a comissar, it was political commander.</span> <span id="s1169">No, I think the commander was one of the people who should be our guide to the forest, because he came several times there and here and he knows, and should know every stone on the highway.</span> <span id="s1170">So, in certain moment he told us, "Now you are taking off your red stars and putting them in a certain place," or maybe eating them -- I don't remember, and he told, "Now you are partisans."</span> <span id="s1171">We have guns.</span> <span id="s1172">We have maybe hiding in certain places because it also can be against us if somebody is coming to make a search, but maybe not because we have all our rifles and now we can now do something, we can defend ourselves.</span> <span id="s1173">So, we went very far about 40 or 50 miles and you have to stand up and then we have to stand in a line and we were walking by foot.</span> <span id="s1174">To put our white shirt or lining, I don't know how to call it in English, big white things, we put it so they -- we could not be very easy watched because this area was with snow and we went, and we went, and many miles and we had heavy packs with us.</span> <span id="s1175">We also have not private packs but things to take for the forest, for the bases, maybe a radio, maybe other things, maybe medicaments for the small hospital that we had in the forest, maybe other things, maybe it calls for -- I don't remember but it was very heavy to go.</span> <span id="s1176">I remember some of the people collapsed on the way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">Q: How many were there with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">A: Oh, we were a very big group, I think 28, and we have -- Q: Men and women?</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">A: Men and women and we have -- I remember everybody has a gun, two have machine guns, and one has an automatic rifle, that's called a sedete (ph) in the Russian terms.</span> <span id="s1180">Even the girls had guns, yes.</span> <span id="s1181">And also it was heavy to have the gun and the pack.</span> <span id="s1182">So, at night we come to a place in a certain village, and we were told that we have not to go in only one -- everybody in one house not in the middle of the village but in the side.</span> <span id="s1183">Excuse me, it was not -- it was at day.</span> <span id="s1184">At night we have to go, to go and to go and to go.</span> <span id="s1185">At day, we come to a certain house like a farm, let's call it farm.</span> <span id="s1186">So everybody come to this farm we weren't allowed to leave.</span> <span id="s1187">Till the evening, we have collected about twenty people.</span> <span id="s1188">So it was a neighbor come to see his neighbor.</span> <span id="s1189">"You are very nice, you are our neighbor but you cannot leave."</span> <span id="s1190">You know, it is because he cannot go and tell the police, and others.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">Nobody is leaving.</span> <span id="s1192">Afterwards come his wife to look after him.</span> <span id="s1193">What is he doing, my husband.</span> <span id="s1194">Maybe he's drinking or maybe other things, so she come also.</span> <span id="s1195">"You will stay with your husband."</span> <span id="s1196">Sometimes you saw kids, and so on and so on.</span> <span id="s1197">As evening, a lot of people with us, and at this time some of us could relax and to sleep by a certain order.</span> <span id="s1198">Some were staying with the rifle and hand radio that everything can't happen.</span> <span id="s1199">And so we make it like two or three days until we come to the forests.</span> <span id="s1200">Yes, and before we come to the forest we have to cross a very critical point.</span> <span id="s1201">It was a railway.</span> <span id="s1202">The railways were very watched by the Germans because it was a very strategic thing.</span> <span id="s1203">Anyway we have to make operation to send people here and there and to watch the Germans will not come here, and we did it.</span> <span id="s1204">After that we have to cross a highway.</span> <span id="s1205">Also, more or less the same tactic and then we were told now we are in the partisan area.</span> <span id="s1206">Partisan area.</span> <span id="s1207">Also, we have to go with the arms, but you feel yourself to be more free, not be in tension so much more.</span> <span id="s1208">But, for me it was another tension.</span> <span id="s1209">If we are already in the kingdom of the partisans, so it's the tension of be proud of, joy, to be glad, to be happy, you can use many words for this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">Sometimes I have seen signs on trees, heavy trees with swamps around them and sometimes we have to go on a very narrow tree which was lying.</span> <span id="s1211">So, as it moved like in a story, or films that we have seen about the partisans after the October revolution in Russia or other places, and we have seen sometimes on the trees signs red, or white, or together so I was sure that it's for us, somebody put this for us.</span> <span id="s1212">I was so trusting of the organizations, the partisans, not more of the organization of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1213">It was another authority for me.</span> <span id="s1214">So, I was very high there, like I was took drugs.</span> <span id="s1215">One moment we saw a man with a big, full hat, a Papacha (ph) it's called, of Siberia, with an automatic arm and he told us a password, in Russian parole.</span> <span id="s1216">He didn't know, but our guys they knew, before they told him so he come smiling to us, "You're partisans," and he shook hands with everybody.</span> <span id="s1217">But we have to go farther and farther, and we were exhausted, especially the girls and we have also weak people.</span> <span id="s1218">Some people are very strong outside but here it was a hero who can make the way can also be a .</span> <span id="s1219">Until we come to our bases.</span> <span id="s1220">In our bases also we have to pass a guard but this guard was already one that we know from the ghetto, our man.</span> <span id="s1221">Now also, we were kissing everybody and he had to leave us and to told that the group came from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1222">He himself could let us come inside.</span> <span id="s1223">He did it, he went, and the other was watching us, it must be.</span> <span id="s1224">And afterward come the commander of the attachment and invited us all with greetings, "Now you can come in, you can come."</span> <span id="s1225">And that was a big celebration.</span> <span id="s1226">Everybody was asking me what happened with my uncle, with my girlfriend, and so on, the other thing, "Have you tobacco?"</span> <span id="s1227">or maybe it was the first question.</span> <span id="s1228">I was very large and everybody I gave my tobacco so tomorrow I have nothing to smoke for myself.</span> <span id="s1229">But it was a very, very, very happy meeting, until its come to a finish and everybody has another friend to ask look we have other music it's not so nice, it's very hard to be a partisan and that already perished and that were already taken as prisoner of war by Germans and we knew what it means to be in prisoners a German, and partisan, and even a Jew, and that sometimes there are anti-Semitic incidents even between the partisans and so on and so on.</span> <span id="s1230">But we were talking half the night until we asleep.</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">Q: Now, when you met with these other people in the forest, were they all Jews, were they Soviet partisans?</span> <span id="s1232">I'm wondering who these other people were.</span> <span id="s1233">Were they all part of your organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">A: This time, and we are talking about March, 1944, and detachments of to the occupants in Russian it's so it can be translated "Death to the occupants or the conquerors," in English.</span> <span id="s1235">So, it was a mixed unit from two or five or three paratroopers, they were the nucleus of this detachment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">Lithuanian, or Russian, people before Communists and they were parachuted into the forest in order to establish this detachment.</span> <span id="s1237">A big part were former prisoner of wars, Russian, who escaped from their camps, P.O.W. camps.</span> <span id="s1238">And a big part, I think in the beginning the people of the ghetto made about 60, if not more percent, coming more and more and more till a day what from the ghetto nobody could no more join us for internal things that happened in the ghetto, so this turning point afterward we become less and less and less.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">Q: And you said there were incidents of anti-Semitism, even with the partisans?</span> <span id="s1240">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">Q: Did you experience any of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">A: I have, yes.</span> <span id="s1243">First at all, I heard the word ours and yours.</span> <span id="s1244">What does it mean?</span> <span id="s1245">For me everybody was now somebody very close.</span> <span id="s1246">We are fighting together, and there, ours and yours.</span> <span id="s1247">And I've seen that also they are living in the same -- incertain concentration of Jewish partisans and un-Jewish, not formal, but de-facto.</span> <span id="s1248">So, I have another example.</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">One of our guys, he was, he come really with us.</span> <span id="s1250">A nice boy, a tall boy, he was dead because he ate too much.</span> <span id="s1251">He was hungry too much and something happened to his stomach and he passed away so we buried him.</span> <span id="s1252">So, what happened, it comes only the commissar and made a speech, "Ta, ta, ta, ta," and from the fighters they are not only Jewish fighters.</span> <span id="s1253">That's what happened.</span> <span id="s1254">There were other things, but I'm not sure if it was anti-Semitism or not, some partisans, Jewish partisans, were shot by their comrades on the way to a certain missions.</span> <span id="s1255">They came without them and told a story there that was very suspicious.</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">End of Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">Tape #5</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">Q: How long were you in the forest fighting with the partisans?</span> <span id="s1259">A: I was till the first week of July 1944, and then --</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">Q: I'm sorry I want to hear a whole sentence, so say I was in the forest.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">A: I was in the forest, or better, in the Rudniky Forest, as partisan till July 1944, the 9th of July we heard the thunder of the big guns, the artillery, the Katusha of the Red Army, or the Soviet Army, so we knew that -- and we knew also from other sources from radio or so, that the Red Army or the Soviet Army is coming back to this area.</span> <span id="s1262">So, we were told also we will go like to help the big army to help them to liberate Wilno because Wilno was very close to us about 20 miles or so.</span> <span id="s1263">But then happened a certain event that was for us, for me personally, very important.</span> <span id="s1264">The 9th of July early in the morning come to us a girl partisan from the Wilno detachment which were located not far.</span> <span id="s1265">We were all the time, we had, I would say, unlegal relations.</span> <span id="s1266">She was also from Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair.</span> <span id="s1267">She was sent by Abba Kovner (ph).</span> <span id="s1268">Abba Kovner was the commando of the Wilno detachment.</span> <span id="s1269">Her name was Ruska Kolchak (ph), a very known partisan.</span> <span id="s1270">She told -- came half secretly to us and told us, "You have to go now as we are doing, you will come to Wilno, but when you come, in Wilno, please don't leave the place.</span> <span id="s1271">You will be in a new organization with the aim of to go immediately by all means we can to Palestine."</span> <span id="s1272">And we were -- it was very logical for us and it was not big surprise and we left the forest and we come to Wilno and then was the beginning of a new organization.</span> <span id="s1273">Afterwards, this organization gets the name Bricha (ph), it means escaping.</span> <span id="s1274">And I was working for the archives of the internal ministry of Soviet Union, it's called Ainkavede (ph), yes.</span> <span id="s1275">I was very proud that they took me.</span> <span id="s1276">They took me because I knew several languages and I was intelligent.</span> <span id="s1277">So, I attended high school, so they took me, and I was working there.</span> <span id="s1278">One of my jobs was to make use from the material the Germans left, papers.</span> <span id="s1279">And I did it with pleasure because I found them very interesting material, even some reports from the Germans made on our activity of my detachments.</span> <span id="s1280">We also found list of names of Lithuanian soldiers and policemen who took part in killing Jewish people, so I was again very happy that I can do some important thing.</span> <span id="s1281">But at the same time, we were building another unlegal organization to go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1282">And one of this was to prepare false documents to go by train or by buses -- not buses but by tracks or by foot or by any means to go to Chernovtsy, it means in Bucovina in the south, southwest of Ukraine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">From there to smuggle the border to Romania and there we were told maybe that we can find a ship and go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1284">That's close enough.</span> <span id="s1285">From Kovno, or from Wilno to Bucuresti was about 1,000 kilometers, it's 900 miles.</span> <span id="s1286">So, we did it bit by bit man after man.</span> <span id="s1287">I left Wilno, I left my job, I left Wilno, I left my arms, with a girlfriend from the ghetto, with her small sister like we are a family.</span> <span id="s1288">I am the father, she is the mother and the small sister is our daughter.</span> <span id="s1289">It makes less dangerous for us.</span> <span id="s1290">We get also a card, how to go from which place to which place, to whom to apply and what will be our passports.</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">And we did it.</span> <span id="s1292">And for instance, I left Wilno I think the 19th of January 1945.</span> <span id="s1293">It means a half year after I left the forest.</span> <span id="s1294">I didn't want to come back to Kovno because I hate Kovno because every man in the street was a killer of my family or other of my friends.</span> <span id="s1295">Wilno was for me more neutral, for me personally, and the other thing that we were told also not to go far because if somebody needed us and I had the opportunity to go and our train was to leave very fast this country, this lousy country of anti-Semitism and killers and all the bad things that I suffered, not only me but our whole communities, whole generation.</span> <span id="s1296">So, we went to Wilno to Minsk, from Minsk to Baranovichi, I'm talking about Byelorussia.</span> <span id="s1297">From Baranovichi to Koval, from Koval to Volpe.</span> <span id="s1298">In each place we found a man he some give us to eat, sometimes also to sleep.</span> <span id="s1299">Sometimes we slept outside on a roof of a wagon, but we did it and in Lvov it is Galicia or west Ukraine, then we met with some girls partisans we can call them liaison officers, L-I-A-S-O-N, so one of them, I remember was Zelda, she was also, she did such a job also between Wilno ghetto and the forests and we went -- and we were sleeping in the Jewish library of Lvov, on the ground, by there were two -- were several people, more and more and they have to go farther.</span> <span id="s1300">So we heard one day that Chernovtsy one of the groups were caught and put into the prison.</span> <span id="s1301">If so, the way is closed to that and we were talking it's burned.</span> <span id="s1302">If so, we have to go to chose an alternative road.</span> <span id="s1303">I even was sent for a while to other places in the south, to Stansislav, it's also the area of Ukraine, in order to make sure what happened in Chernovtsy because -- anyway I come back to Lvov, Lvov it's Lemburg, so I give a report and we decided to go straight from Lvov to Poland.</span> <span id="s1304">To go to Poland we have to take new documents that we are Poles.</span> <span id="s1305">So we made it, we crossed the border and the next day we were in a city called Pshemysl, or Peremyshl.</span> <span id="s1306">There we also have to wait for several weeks, two weeks or three weeks and we made also a new kibbutz.</span> <span id="s1307">We are living together and tried to go farther, also to make new documents because we didn't talk Polish.</span> <span id="s1308">In Lithuania, the Jewish people, our generation, doesn't understand Polish.</span> <span id="s1309">Even not to talk, and if you are talking, everybody will see that we are foreigners and that was very dangerous because we escaped from the Soviet Union and that only traitors are doing or enemies of the people and so on and so on.</span> <span id="s1310">They will catch us and they will send us to Siberia, if not to shoot us.</span> <span id="s1311">So, we went from Pshemysl to Zeshev (ph).</span> <span id="s1312">In Zeshev we did a very fine thing.</span> <span id="s1313">We went to the commander, or chief office of the county governor, Starosta (ph), Polish, and we told him that we are partisans who were from Greece and have to go to our country back.</span> <span id="s1314">And we were talking between us Lithuanian.</span> <span id="s1315">A little bit of Yiddish and we -- the rabbi of Zeshev, he knew the truth and he was translator.</span> <span id="s1316">Before coming to this man, the governor, we make on our hands numbers like we were prisoners of Auschwitz or other places.</span> <span id="s1317">We do it with very easy ink, the next day we could take it off.</span> <span id="s1318">And we showed, "You see?"</span> <span id="s1319">He told, "Here are the people."</span> <span id="s1320">And we showed, "Here."</span> <span id="s1321">So he gave us immediately, he was a very nice man, "Oh Greece, good."</span> <span id="s1322">It was an incident he would -- he want that we will meet a really group from Greece and so we were very afraid they will recognize that we are not.</span> <span id="s1323">So, we said, "No, we are very tired and we have to go immediately."</span> <span id="s1324">He gave us documents and we went.</span> <span id="s1325">From Zeshev to Transylvania, it means already Romania.</span> <span id="s1326">Cluj, Klausenberg, from Cluj we took express train to Bucuresti because Bucuresti was former Romania and we trust that from Bucuresti we can go to Constanta to the port and then to take a ship to go to Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">But in Bucuresti probably the KGB or other services were following us.</span> <span id="s1328">And we have to move, we have to move and we heard that in Italy is a Jewish brigade from Palestine so that could be a good way we thanks them to come.</span> <span id="s1329">So we did.</span> <span id="s1330">And after being three months in Bucharest, also we were living in kibbutzim, oh, we were very -- not only from Lithuania also from Poland and Czechoslovakia and other places everybody was safe to remember that that is the best way to go to Palestine, but only for us former citizens from Soviet Russia, because Lithuania was a part of Soviet Russia, was so dangerous.</span> <span id="s1331">So we decided we are going to Italy so we went back from Bucuresti to Cluj from Cluj to Budapest, from Budapest to Chambatoy (ph), from there to Saltzburg, that means Austria.</span> <span id="s1332">In Austria we have to cross the border again to the area which belonged to the British Army, means Italy.</span> <span id="s1333">Also we have again to cross the border and we were arrested several times by the Russians, patrols, and they took us here and took us back and everytime we have another story.</span> <span id="s1334">In each pocket we have another document, other names, and we have to remember all the names all the nicknames, everything.</span> <span id="s1335">So, we come to Italy.</span> <span id="s1336">Italy we come to Tarviso (ph), it's on the border between Italy and Austria.</span> <span id="s1337">We came the 15th or 14th of July 1945, and that was a big, big festival.</span> <span id="s1338">What happened, many leaders from the survivors come there then we met Mr. Garfunkel, who was a member of the Elderstrat, and he was so nice received by the soldiers.</span> <span id="s1339">Some of them were from Lithuania who emigrated to Palestine many years ago.</span> <span id="s1340">They knew he was a very prominent man.</span> <span id="s1341">Afterwards was Abba Kovner from Wilno, and maybe also Tzivia (ph) -- no, Tzivia we met on the way.</span> <span id="s1342">Anyway, it was a big, big festival now, and from there we have yes, and Abba Kovner sent me for another emissary back to the Russians in order to show -- to be a guide for three soldiers from the Jewish brigade who want to go back to their homes.</span> <span id="s1343">I don't know if they deserted for a certain time or get permission, but he was sure that if I made the way several times I know.</span> <span id="s1344">I didn't know, but I did it.</span> <span id="s1345">I didn't know the way, but somehow I did it and come back.</span> <span id="s1346">When I come back I told more I will not go.</span> <span id="s1347">I would like to come here to Palestine and finish with all the tasks.</span> <span id="s1348">I am a private man now, so I was put in another kibbutz of young people with the supervision of Jewish soldiers in Mestre (ph), Mestre it very close to Venice, and we spend there a very nice Rosh Hashana, in the ghetto, Venice, in the Nafi (ph) of the English Army, with a chaplain, evrything, very nice.</span> <span id="s1349">The Jewish soldiers become our parents of this kibbutz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">One day I was told that, "You because you are already on the way a long time, you are chosen with another one to go to Palestine."</span> <span id="s1351">It was in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s1352">Everything, you know, secretly and so and so, underground noise, and you're underground.</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">Underground of the Bricha, that's made by Israel -- Palestine guys together with Jewish soldiers from the Brigade, or other soldiers, it was another mafia.</span> <span id="s1354">So, we went all the night by truck, from Venice to Barre.</span> <span id="s1355">It's all Italy, maybe took more than one night, I don't remember.</span> <span id="s1356">But we come -- it was in the south of Italy.</span> <span id="s1357">We were put in another camp, a very secret camp.</span> <span id="s1358">We could not go out because it was secretly and the Italians should not know who we are.</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">Q: How many were there of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">A: Oh, we were then about 250 people.</span> <span id="s1361">Also from other groups because it was like a stream, which is going and when the stream is coming near Palestine, the stream becomes bigger and bigger and bigger.</span> <span id="s1362">So, we met people from other places even they come from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1363">They were the real Auschwitz, not like me with a false number.</span> <span id="s1364">And even from France and from Belgium and from many places.</span> <span id="s1365">I told you it's like a river, it's coming, it's coming, but this place we were isolated -- even not to buy a wine from the peasants.</span> <span id="s1366">They have a good wine for us, it was very important so we did, at night we did it.</span> <span id="s1367">But we lost our patience and one day they took several guys from us, I think there were 180, and took us also by night -- at night to a certain place, a hiding port, a small port in Trento (ph), this is south of, south of Italy, and there was waiting for us a small ship.</span> <span id="s1368">A small ship, a small ship, like half of a normal tennis place.</span> <span id="s1369">We were 180 people and when we come to the ship it is also by certain order.</span> <span id="s1370">It reminds me when I come to the truck in order to go to the forest.</span> <span id="s1371">I wrote it afterwards also in my diary that it's the same sensation I have.</span> <span id="s1372">Anyway we were took on the ship.</span> <span id="s1373">The ship was very small, but in such a room there were about five or six floors of places to sleep, like in a store.</span> <span id="s1374">Every man has so much place and it was -- I can't describe -- it was made like in a field hospital when somebody is carrying you.</span> <span id="s1375">So, it was such --</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">Q: A cot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">A: A cot, yes.</span> <span id="s1378">Many cots, and we were lying there about seven nights, six nights only at night we could go and have fresh air because British airplanes if they're watching us, military airplanes, because in this time the British prohibited to -- were not allowing the Jewish to come by the thousands to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1379">It was their policy.</span> <span id="s1380">And one night we could see the lights, we were told the Carmel Mount and other things, so afterwards it was not true it was Cypress, and we have to make it around Cypress because some ships were running after us, the English marina.</span> <span id="s1381">So, marina in the sea and the Royal Air Force in the skies.</span> <span id="s1382">Everybody is running after us.</span> <span id="s1383">After we already left Europe, but we are in a very, very good mood, also singing.</span> <span id="s1384">There were some pregnant women with us and we have not too much water.</span> <span id="s1385">We are very short on water until we came one night, it was the 23rd of October, 1945 to a place, very small place that ship can stay near.</span> <span id="s1386">It was in the center of the coast of Palestine, Israel between Shefaim (ph) and Kibbutz -- Kibbutz Shefaim, and another place, let's say Kibbutz Shefaim.</span> <span id="s1387">And there we have seen that many very small people are coming like swimming.</span> <span id="s1388">We didn't know who they are.</span> <span id="s1389">Afterwards we realized that they were people of the Hagganah (ph), who come to take us because we will not -- we have to go in the water.</span> <span id="s1390">So, I remember that a very heavy girl took me on her shoulder so I told her, "I can go by my foot."</span> <span id="s1391">No she told, "We have order, nobody will go."</span> <span id="s1392">After that I understood, because we had to make several kilometers by foot until we came to a certain place that they took us on another truck and also us and also what we have, our cargo.</span> <span id="s1393">I had some shmates (ph) with me, that's all.</span> <span id="s1394">Anyway, when they took us also, I could see that some people with Australian big hats are watching with arms on the two sides.</span> <span id="s1395">I was told that if the British police will come, they will shoot on them.</span> <span id="s1396">So I was told, I don't know if they would do it.</span> <span id="s1397">Anyway, I felt myself very good and I remember that we were so thirsty that we took grapefruits from the trees and we eat it together -- all together.</span> <span id="s1398">And the same nights we were brought to a village by the name Givat Chen (ph).</span> <span id="s1399">They took me and another partisan and knocked on the door.</span> <span id="s1400">It was in the midnight.</span> <span id="s1401">The man asked, "Who are you?"</span> <span id="s1402">His answer was very funny, "We brought you a man from the sea."</span> <span id="s1403">So, I am a man from the sea.</span> <span id="s1404">I never was a sailor.</span> <span id="s1405">"A man of the sea," he opened immediately.</span> <span id="s1406">Maybe it was also a password, I don't know, but he understand, he looked at me and cried.</span> <span id="s1407">He talked with me Polish, German, Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1408">I told him I am talking Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1409">"Oh, very good, very good."</span> <span id="s1410">All his family were sleeping and he asked me, "Don't to talk so loud."</span> <span id="s1411">I told him, "But I am happy."</span> <span id="s1412">So, he put me in the washroom to clean myself because I maybe was looking like a rubber something with a beard, not make my hair nothing.</span> <span id="s1413">Half military uniform, I have half civilian, a very bad impression.</span> <span id="s1414">So, he took me in the washroom leave me in the washroom to wash.</span> <span id="s1415">When he come back, he found me drinking the water, here from the water, he looked, "What are you mad?"</span> <span id="s1416">I tell him, "I am still thirsty.</span> <span id="s1417">I have not drink water for several days."</span> <span id="s1418">I told him, "I can give you coffee or tea as much as you want."</span> <span id="s1419">Anyway, I slept and the day after they collected all the people from the farmers from this village, and everybody had to decide where he is going.</span> <span id="s1420">It was a table with a green cover like in an office, and there were sitting people from several organizations.</span> <span id="s1421">Zionists, left Zionists, this Zionists, anyway, and also Beitar, or not Beitar, anyway, I told that I belong to Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair so please send me the kibbutz of Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair, so it happened.</span> <span id="s1422">And afterwards I was living in this kibbutz, Beit Zera (ph) a year, until September 1946 and then I decided to go to Jerusalem to the University.</span> <span id="s1423">But it was a short time, I could not make my studies because it occured the War of Independence and that's another story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">Q: How long was this journey from the time that you were in Wilno and you made the decision until the time you actually came ashore in Palestine, how many months?</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">A: The decision was made in the 9th of July, 1944, but it was only a decision.</span> <span id="s1426">But the really journey began the 19th of January 1945 and finished the 23rd of October 1945, so it means about ten months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">Q: I want to ask you one more question, and it's a little bit of a different way of thinking.</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">You've had many experiences over the last 40 years in Israel and that's for another time, but you rebuilt your life.</span> <span id="s1429">You have a very fascinating life in Israel now.</span> <span id="s1430">Are there influences from your boyhood in Kovno that you think are still a part of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">A: Boyhood, you mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">Q: The time you're growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">A: You mean till the Holocaust or after, because you cannot put --</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">Q: Not after so much, but I mean you came from a strong culture or strong community in Kovno, family, friends, religion, how much did that influence what you became later on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">A: Oh, I think that my childhood and what you call boyhood, is a new word for me, I never heard it, but I like it, it, I think it's a continuity, nothing happened because when I came to Palestine I found many of my family of my uncles, aunts, cousins, classmates who did it before from the organization from Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair, so it was a road.</span> <span id="s1436">A road that everybody will do it before or after, so for me it was so natural, only what happened, the Holocaust and all the things after and maybe also include the Soviet time 1940 and 1941, it was something out the order for me.</span> <span id="s1437">But to come to Palestine what for me it was like two and two are four.</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">Q: I was just wondering if there was anything especially unique in your growing up in Kovno that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">A: Yeah, but Kovno was a very modern community.</span> <span id="s1440">Kovno, Lithuania of Kovno, even more than Wilno was called the Eretz Yisrael of the Diaspora.</span> <span id="s1441">So sometimes we were also -- it was not all the community but we were brought up in a Jewish, Yiddish, or Communist ideology but if we take, I would say about 60 percent of the Lithuanian Jewry they were brought up in the way that I was brought up.</span> <span id="s1442">May I give you an example.</span> <span id="s1443">In 1935 there were elections in all the world for the Zionist Congress.</span> <span id="s1444">It happened every two years so in this small Lithuania with about 155,000 Jewish people inhabitants, they took part in this elections about, I think, more than 45,000 people.</span> <span id="s1445">Maybe some of them did it not seriously, they did automatically, and maybe they were not very strong Zionists, but anyway in this time is a need of the 30's the Zionist, I would not even tell Zionists, the national feeling was very strong.</span> <span id="s1446">The Hebrew culture was dominating.</span> <span id="s1447">So, even religious people were Zionist, so it's not a contradiction.</span> <span id="s1448">So, I cannot see that Israel in the 40's when I came was something new for me.</span> <span id="s1449">I'll give you another example.</span> <span id="s1450">When the bus, no it was a bus, no more trucks, it was a bus from Egged company took us from the place I was at night in the village Givat Chen, to the kibbutz, I was sitting and I remember a woman asked me, "Where are we now?</span> <span id="s1451">What is here?"</span> <span id="s1452">It's a long way it's about four hours.</span> <span id="s1453">So I told her, "You don't know?</span> <span id="s1454">That's the Mount Tabor."</span> <span id="s1455">So, because I knew the geography of Palestine, or Eretz Yisrael, more than of Lithuania.</span> <span id="s1456">And you know like a fish who is in an aquarium and put back to the original water.</span> <span id="s1457">That happened to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">A: You're welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">End of Tape #5 Conclusion of Interview</span></p></body></html>
