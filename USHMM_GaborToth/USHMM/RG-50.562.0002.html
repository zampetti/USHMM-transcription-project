States that time, so they were Kalish, and we were Heisler.</span> <span id="s166">And that’s how we became Heisler.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: Wait a minute, I don’t understand.</span> <span id="s168">Why did you fa -- why did your father have to become a Heisler?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: Because my grandfather and grandmother didn’t get married in court, only by a

gendarmes come over and pick me up.</span> <span id="s523">They walk me -- it was about 15 kilometers to Svalava, which was a military complex, and there they [indecipherable] me up there and said [indecipherable] I was the only Jewish kid, was a lot of the Gentile kids, and the lieutenant asked me questions, why didn’t you go to school, and I didn’t have a chance to answer him, and he gave me a slap on my face, I thought my f -- well, even my head is going to spin off.</span> <span id="s524">And I was about 15 - 16 year -- you know, years old.</span> <span id="s525">And then they put us in a cell, which is about a third of this room, with 20 of us in there.</span> <span id="s526">No beds, no nothing, and we used to take turns to sleep, one at a -- you know, a few of us at a time, we decided.</span> <span id="s527">And I was in that -- and they disinfected our clothes.</span> <span id="s528">And I was there for about two weeks, and I understand my mother went to the priest and tried to ask him to interfere -- intervene, and that’s how I got out after two weeks.</span> <span id="s529">And I came home on Shabbos, you know.</span> <span id="s530">My clothes, from the disinfection was all torn up and everything else, and they were sitting having Shabbos dinner, and that’s how I got home, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: We have to change the tape now.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">End of Tape One</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Beginning Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: Alan, I know you got out of

were let out, just to get the fresh air a little bit.</span> <span id="s541">Otherwise we were locked up there, standing up like a bunch of dummies.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: And you were all about 14 or 15 years old?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: Yeah, only school kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: And was there a bucket here, so fo -- as a toilet?</span> <span id="s545">I mean, what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: Well, actually was -- you know, was a -- we were allowed to go one at a time to the john.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: You were.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: It was a -- yeah, and it was a military barracks, and you were allowed to go.</span> <span id="s549">If you had to go you knocked on the cell and somebody would let you out.</span> <span id="s550">It’s -- it’s something that I don’t remember very much that -- you know, it’s kind of got out of my mind because it was so horrible there, you know?</span> <span id="s551">But -- two weeks to be under that -- under those conditions.</span> <span id="s552">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: Why do you think they listened to your mother, a -- and the priest?</span> <span id="s554">Why did she go to a priest, that’s first.</span> <span id="s555">Do you know why?</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: It was the only a-authority that I would -- th-the Hungarians would listen.</span> <span id="s557">A rabbi wouldn’t -- I mean, we -- first of all, we didn’t have a rabbi.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: That’s right, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: And the shochet had -- was useless really, because he -- aya -- he had no a -- no authority as such, I mean, and even a rabbi, those days anti-Semitism was really starting to get, you know, noticed.</span> <span id="s560">I also remember after the Hungarians came in, this colonel wanted all the Jews -- males 13 and up to come over for a meeting.</span> <span id="s561">And he started to lambaste everybody.</span> <span id="s562">The Jews are the only ones who are non-productive, non -- no -- nothing.</span> <span id="s563">The -- everybody works on Saturday except the

harder than coal because stone is heavier, and you had to shovel, and sho -- shovel into trucks.</span> <span id="s1758">So the work was much harder, so I didn’t last there very long.</span> <span id="s1759">I lasted -- I don’t remember, a few days or a few weeks, or wa -- I think it was like maybe a few weeks.</span> <span id="s1760">And they were -- they took me to this place where they said,

time.</span> <span id="s1768">And then all of a sudden the Americans were approaching.</span> <span id="s1769">So, they didn’t want anybody to see that, so they put us in trucks and took us to Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s1770">Q: Uh-huh, but you were -- was this place that they put you in, in Krawinkle?</span> <span id="s1771">Or do you think it was in --</span></p> <p><span

wound ru -- and my feet were open wounds, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s1802">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1803">A: -- and I was weak, I couldn’t shovel the snow in -- in -- the rocks any more, so they took me away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1804">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1805">Had you lost a lot of weight?</span></p> <p><span id="s1806">A: Oh yeah, I was skin and bones by that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1807">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s1808">So it must have been really hard, because you have been strong --</span></p> <p><span id="s1809">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1810">Q: -- throughout the whole period, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1811">A: That’s right, but this time -- this time I was going down the tubes in a hurry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1812">Q:

people, their stomach is, you know, just about dried up.</span> <span id="s1884">And they ate that, a lot of them got dysentery and died.</span> <span id="s1885">So then all of a sudden they changed everything, and started to bring in some lighter food, and stuff like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1886">Q: Did you eat that s -- pea soup?</span></p> <p><span id="s1887">A: I had a little bit.</span> <span id="s1888">I didn’t have too much because I couldn’t eat, you know.</span> <span id="s1889">But then I started -- and then they started to bring in different food, and I started to

go?”</span> <span id="s1899">I said, “I don’t know.”</span> <span id="s1900">And then we heard there’s a -- a Rabbi Schechter is organizing a group of 17 and under, and take -- going to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1901">So I went to register, and I was accepted.</span> <span id="s1902">And that’s how I wound up in Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1903">Q: Switzerland.</span>

didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1914">Well -- well -- how did that happen, blah, blah, blah.</span> <span id="s1915">So they made them dig trenches and bury the dead.</span> <span id="s1916">Cause

were able yet to do something, yes there was revenge.</span> <span id="s1923">But not too many people were able-bodied to do anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1924">Q: And what did they do, the ones who were able-bodied?</span></p> <p><span id="s1925">A: Oh, they would beat him up and stuff like that, you know?</span> <span id="s1926">And pointing fingers at them to the Americans, that he was a bad boy and stuff like that, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1927">Q: Did you want to beat up some of these people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1928">A: I was in no shape to do anything.</span></p>

<span id="s2092">And that’s how we -- most of us got separated.</span></p> <p><span id="s2093">Q: And what were you doing in Baix?</span></p> <p><span id="s2094">A: Nothing.</span></p> <p><span

Hora.</span> <span id="s2099">That’s -- that’s the main activity, nothing else.</span> <span id="s2100">No school, no -- no teaching, no nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2101">Q: And who was teaching

<p><span id="s2107">Q: And were they trying to get you to go to Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s2108">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2109">Q: And you didn’t want to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s2110">A: Well, at that time, my -- I didn’t know what I wanted, but I knew I wanted to do something besides sit there and doing the Hora, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2111">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2112">A: -- and singing he -- what do you call it, Hebrew songs.</span></p> <p><span id="s2113">Q: And you are 18 or 19 years old at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s2114">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2115">Q: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2116">A: About 19 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s2117">Q: I think we have to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s2118">End of Tape Four</span></p> <p><span id="s2119">Beginning Tape Five</span></p> <p><span id="s2120">Q: On the last tape you talked about going to Geneva.</span> <span id="s2121">What -- do you remember approximately when, was it June, July or August of ’45?</span></p> <p><span id="s2122">A: I -- I -- I would say it was closer to June.</span></p> <p><span id="s2123">Q: Closer to June.</span> <span id="s2124">And -- and what were you going to do in Geneva?</span></p> <p><span id="s2125">A: Well, like I told you before, all we were doing is useless things, you’re singing songs and all that.</span> <span id="s2126">And there was a little synagogue in Baix, and I went down there, and I says, “Is there anything, any school that we could go to and do something?”</span> <span id="s2127">So one guy comes over and he says, “Well, there is an ORT school in Geneva.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2128">Q: ORT.</span></p> <p><span id="s2129">A: ORT school.</span></p> <p><span id="s2130">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2131">A: And there is a gentleman by the name of Syngalowsky, who is world president.</span> <span id="s2132">He said we could go see him.</span> <span id="s2133">Maybe we can do something for you.</span> <span id="s2134">So I said okay, says, “Give me his address where he -- where his office is.”</span> <span id="s2135">So one Sunday morning, another guy and I said, “Well let’s -- let’s jump the train and si -- get down to Geneva and see, know -- you know, what we can do.”</span> <span id="s2136">So, we went down there, we got off the train, and we kept asking -- I had a little -- very little knowledge of French, and find the place, knocked on his door, and he said in English, “What do you want?”</span> <span id="s2137">So I said, “Look,” I said, “I came down here because we need help.”</span> <span id="s2138">He said, “What do you mean, what kind of help?”</span> <span id="s2139">And we were talking in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s2140">And I told him, I says, “We are over there doing nothing, wasting our time.</span> <span id="s2141">We are all survivors, and we would like to go to school.”</span> <span id="s2142">So, you know, we were talking back and forth, he said, “I’ll tell you what.</span> <span id="s2143">Here is the money, buy yourself a ticket, go back on the train, and I’ll see what I can do.”</span> <span id="s2144">Two weeks later, we go into Geneva, about a dozen of us or so.</span> <span id="s2145">And we ge -- and we went, came down to Geneva, and there was a -- a house there, not far from the airport, and I don’t remember the name, but there was other refugees, but these -- these were not survivors, these are people who during the war they ran away and this and that.</span> <span id="s2146">And we were with them, and they were -- some of those went to work, and we went to work also, and we were introduced to a scu -- what do you call it, to the teachers over there, one of them was a Polish Jew, was a -- he was a math professor, he was really good.</span> <span id="s2147">And then the shop f -- foreman, and we -- we went down there and started to learn.</span> <span id="s2148">And a couple weeks later, they separated us from that group, and just the survivors got a place there, it was called Hôme de Pregni, right back of the United Nations building.</span> <span id="s2149">And there they also had a psychologist, and they had a house mother, and we went to school, and started to learn.</span> <span id="s2150">And I -- I requested to get a French tutor for me because I wanted to learn French in a hurry.</span> <span id="s2151">And once I had a knowledge of conversational French, I decided to register -- it was for the fall semester, in the community college.</span></p> <p><span id="s2152">Q: Why did you want to learn French?</span></p> <p><span id="s2153">A: Because that was the language down there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2154">Q: Uh-huh, okay, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2155">A: And I think when you go to school down there, you have to learn how to speak French.</span> <span id="s2156">And -- which I did.</span> <span id="s2157">It was a little hard in the beginning, but I mastered the language pretty quick.</span> <span id="s2158">I would s -- I was really -- a language I’m really fast to learn.</span> <span id="s2159">And I went to school, and I still went -- and the tutor still was, you know, teaching me French, and in ORT I was doing very well.</span> <span id="s2160">And I’ll tell you, they really taught us basics, and precision, how to operate each shop piece of equipment, and that’s what we did.</span> <span id="s2161">You learn how to do it, and after awhile, they separated the top students, and gave them advanced [indecipherable] and I was one of them, was a few of us.</span> <span id="s2162">And after about a year, I was offered to go to Vavey, they are gonna have a college over there, and oh -- teach ORT -- how to teach ORT students.</span></p> <p><span id="s2163">Q: To learn to be an instructor.</span></p> <p><span id="s2164">A: I would be an instru -- or an instructor.</span> <span id="s2165">And I said okay, but then I got worried that there is a transport of 50 people, United States will let them in as long as their relatives are sponsors in the States, they can go.</span> <span id="s2166">And that’s how I got to the States.</span></p> <p><span id="s2167">Q: Let me ask you something.</span> <span id="s2168">What -- what were you learning?</span> <span id="s2169">What -- what was ORT training you to do?</span> <span id="s2170">Would -- did they have different kinds of courses, and you took one kind of course?</span></p> <p><span id="s2171">A: They were carpentry.</span></p> <p><span id="s2172">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2173">A: There was one guy, this guy Morrie Goldfinger, he’s a friend of mine, he couldn’t comprehend math, and physics, so they sent him to a butcher shop, to learn how to be a butcher.</span> <span id="s2174">And he was -- let me tell you, he was very successful as a butcher in the States.</span> <span id="s2175">He really did well for himself.</span> <span id="s2176">Used to go out for dinner, and he would go into the back kitchen, and you want to buy meat, I’ll give you a good break on meat.</span> <span id="s2177">And he built up a good business.</span> <span id="s2178">And some of them learned carpentry.</span> <span id="s2179">You know, whatever you were suited for.</span></p> <p><span id="s2180">Q: And -- and what were you learning?</span></p> <p><span id="s2181">A: Mechanics.</span> <span id="s2182">I wa --</span></p> <p><span id="s2183">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s2184">So you were continuing what you had studied --</span></p> <p><span id="s2185">A: Yes, I was -- I was good at being mechanic -- mechanical.</span></p> <p><span id="s2186">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2187">A: And that’s what I was doing in Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s2188">Q: In -- in August of 1946, a psychologist named David Boder was in Geneva interviewing people.</span> <span id="s2189">Do you have any recollection of being interviewed back then?</span></p> <p><span id="s2190">A: I -- I had a slight, a very, very slight, but don’t remember -- I don’t [indecipherable] what he looked like, but I do remember now that you brought it up that he was interviewing -- somebody was interviewing me.</span> <span id="s2191">And that’s about all.</span></p> <p><span id="s2192">Q: And that’s all.</span> <span id="s2193">Let me just play you a few minutes.</span> <span id="s2194">I’m -- I’m hoping that you can hear this, and I’ll bring it near you.</span> <span id="s2195">We’ll play the first few minutes of the beginning of the tape.</span> <span id="s2196">Now it’s silent -- where he just asks you a few questions.</span> <span id="s2197">First in English [plays audio tape of Boder interview].</span> <span id="s2198">Does this -- do --</span></p> <p><span id="s2199">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2200">Q: -- do you recognize your voice?</span></p> <p><span id="s2201">A: Yes, I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s2202">Q: Do you -- does hearing it bring back any memory of talking with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s2203">A: Some, some.</span></p> <p><span id="s2204">Q: It does?</span></p> <p><span id="s2205">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2206">Q: Is his voice familiar to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2207">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2208">Q: It is?</span></p> <p><span id="s2209">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2210">Q: Can you picture him in your mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s2211">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2212">Q: No.</span> <span id="s2213">So you have -- you can’t see where it was you were sitting --</span></p> <p><span id="s2214">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2215">Q:

you’re one of the few people.</span> <span id="s2223">And I guess I can’t ask you any questions about it --</span></p> <p><span id="s2224">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2225">Q: -- because -- do you have any recollection of who told you talk with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s2226">A: It was Madame Goldman.</span> <span id="s2227">She was in charge of ORT down there, and -- and she was the one who’s -- thought I should talk to him.</span> <span id="s2228">And she was very nice lady.</span></p> <p><span id="s2229">Q: You talked with him, I don’t know, it was about -- little less than 45 minutes, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s2230">A: That long, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s2231">Q: Yeah, 45 minutes to an hour.</span> <span id="s2232">And you -- you couldn’t tell him what you did

id="s2281">Q: Did they meet you at the boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s2282">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2283">Q: Did other friends of yours travel on the same boat, or were you alone?</span></p>

know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2303">Q: Did --</span></p> <p><span id="s2304">A: And when I got off the ship, my relatives expected me to come off in some raggedy clothes, and I was all dressed up in a nice suit and tie, and they said, “Where the hell is he coming from?”</span></p> <p><span id="s2305">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2306">A: So -- but, you know, he -- we were allowed some money in expenses, and wh-what do you call it, we bought nice clothes to come to the States.</span></p> <p><span id="s2307">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2308">And who -- who met you, either two brothers or one brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s2309">A: Two brothers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2310">Q: Two brothers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2311">A: They both -- both met us.</span> <span

never met them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2316">A: No.</span> <span id="s2317">As a matter of fact, one day I -- my cousin, first cousin, I was at hi -- at his daughter’s house, and we sat next to each other, now don’t tell me that they don’t look alike.</span> <span id="s2318">We do look quite alike.</span></p> <p><span id="s2319">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2320">Would -- did they remind you of your father in some way?</span> <span id="s2321">Were they somewhat like him?</span></p> <p><span id="s2322">A: My father was a more outgoing --</span></p> <p><span id="s2323">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2324">A: My father was a lot more outgoing, they were a little more subdued, you know, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2325">Q: So -- but was it good to be able to be with them because they were relat -- because they were your father’s brothers?</span></p> <p><span id="s2326">A: Well, yes, but that wasn’t my favorite place to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s2327">Q: It wasn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s2328">A: No.</span> <span id="s2329">Because, first of all, I was a li -- staying in the living room, and sleeping on the couch.</span> <span id="s2330">That wasn’t the best situation.</span> <span id="s2331">I had no privacy, and most of my friends were in Manhattan.</span> <span id="s2332">So after I don’t know how many weeks, or maybe a month or six weeks, I got a hotel room with a friend of mine in Manhattan, on Hundred Street and Broadway, and we got a room, a beautiful room, and somebody was cleaning it every day, and you know, you use the restaurants down there wherever you turned, and I was working already, so I have some money, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2333">Q: It was okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s2334">A: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2335">Q: And your relatives were living where, Brooklyn?</span></p> <p><span id="s2336">A: No, in Queens.</span></p> <p><span id="s2337">Q: In Queens.</span></p> <p><span id="s2338">A: Jackson Heights.</span></p> <p><span id="s2339">Q: So that must have felt really far away from --</span></p> <p><span id="s2340">A: Yes and no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2341">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2342">A: Yes and no.</span> <span id="s2343">My -- their children, my cousins, we kept in touch.</span></p> <p><span id="s2344">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2345">Were they sorry to see you go?</span> <span id="s2346">Did they --</span></p> <p><span id="s2347">A: Yes, my -- really were kind of disappointed that I left, but you know, wasn’t -- wasn’t -- wasn’t my way of living.</span> <span id="s2348">I was up to knowing there’s a little better things in life than sleeping on the couch without privacy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2349">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2350">And what did your father’s brothers do?</span> <span id="s2351">What was --</span></p> <p><span id="s2352">A: Well, one of them owned a bun -- a -- a -- a Laundromat, or a cleaning store, stuff like that, and they were pretty well off.</span> <span id="s2353">And they’re the ones who sent -- it was 350 dollars for the trip.</span> <span id="s2354">And they are the ones who sponsored the 350 thousand -- 350 dollars.</span> <span id="s2355">The other one was -- he was -- you know, those days you didn’t have washing machines, so you picked up laundry, and bring it to the laundry, and bah, bah, bah.</span> <span id="s2356">So they weren’t too well off, and that’s where I was staying, basically.</span> <span id="s2357">And wasn’t my ideal place, for a real life to live.</span> <span id="s2358">And moving to Manhattan, there was a lot of other friends that I knew, and was more accessible to places, and doing things, and I ju -- I -- I really did enjoy it much better.</span> <span id="s2359">Excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2360">Q: Did you go to night school right away to learn English?</span></p> <p><span id="s2361">A: First thing, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2362">Q: First thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2363">A: First thing I did is register to school, and I went to school.</span> <span id="s2364">And there -- I -- I remember I used to go to work, and -- from eight to 4:30, and I -- it was an old Greek restaurant there, and I used to go there, do my homework.</span> <span id="s2365">And classes would start at seven o’clock, seven to 10, and it was a routine, daily routine.</span></p> <p><span id="s2366">Q: And what were you -- what work were you doing?</span> <span id="s2367">Were you [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2368">A: Well, I started off with a s -- first of all -- first job I had was operating a automatic turret lathe.</span></p> <p><span id="s2369">Q: An automatic --</span></p> <p><span id="s2370">A: Turret lathe.</span> <span id="s2371">It’s a lathe that --</span></p> <p><span id="s2372">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2373">A: -- does repetitive work, you know, you set it up once, and it keeps knocking out hundreds of pieces of whatever you set it up for.</span></p> <p><span id="s2374">Q: And you have to watch it to make sure it’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s2375">A: I have to watch it that everything goes well, so -- but you si -- you si -- stand there like a dummy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2376">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2377">A: So my uncle had a -- knew somebody who had a shop, a machine shop, and he told me to go down there for an interview.</span> <span id="s2378">And the guy who I was working for, only about two or three days, “Oh,” he says, “y-you s -- you can’t leave.”</span> <span id="s2379">He was a Greek and he spoke some German, and he says, “You can’t leave, you’re doing such a good job.”</span> <span id="s2380">I said, “I can’t stand here, you know, s -- stand in that one spot doing nothing.”</span> <span id="s2381">So I went down there for the interview, and I -- he hired me right away, and now I’m -- so I went to work over there, and he paid me 75 cents an hour, and I did -- you know, whatever I had to do, and one day they were trying to do something, to solder a certain part and a -- it was an al -- a lot of them, and nobody knew how to do it.</span> <span id="s2382">So I said, “I’ll show you how to do it.”</span> <span id="s2383">So all of a sudden, “How about you come in on Saturday and do all that?”</span> <span id="s2384">I said okay.</span> <span id="s2385">And then they found out a lot of things I was able to do that they weren’t too good at it.</span> <span id="s2386">So all of a sudden, I’m working overtime, but no raise, still 75 cents an hour.</span> <span id="s2387">So you -- at school, I -- I talked to all these different guys, one guy’s telling me there’s a company that is hiring, the name is National Equipment, and they told me the address.</span> <span id="s2388">“Why don’t you go down there, see if they’ll hire you?”</span> <span id="s2389">So I went down there, and sure enough they hired me, and I was getting a dollar and a quarter an hour.</span> <span id="s2390">Making a big money now.</span></p> <p><span id="s2391">Q: Big money, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s2392">A: I make big bucks now.</span></p> <p><span id="s2393">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2394">A: So I got the job, and over there I -- I did very well over there also, so they put me with this guy to work.</span> <span id="s2395">He was the guy who was traveling out to [indecipherable] not, so -- but whenever he did something, he did it so I shouldn’t see.</span> <span id="s2396">I says, “Mitch,” I says, “you don’t have to hide, I know how to do that, it is -- just don’t worry about it.”</span> <span id="s2397">So him and I went out on the first job, over the weekend, you know, they had some problems [indecipherable] some of the equipment to straighten it out.</span> <span id="s2398">So he says, oh I can’t -- I said I want to stay in this hotel, and he said, “Oh, I can’t stay there, it’s too much money.”</span> <span id="s2399">I go, “That’s too bad.</span> <span id="s2400">I’m going to stay there, and you go wherever the flea b -- flea-bit hotel.”</span> <span id="s2401">So sure enough he went there that night, I told him we gotta meet for dinner over someplace, and he was afraid to order anything half decent.</span> <span id="s2402">And I just handed my bill in, and he handed his, and I got paid, he got paid, nobody said a word, you know?</span> <span id="s2403">But he didn’t last long, he died.</span> <span id="s2404">And all of a sudden I’m the guy who has to go out there on my own.</span> <span id="s2405">Which I did, and I -- and I remember at one time I -- I was in bo -- they send me out to Boston, and the owners over there look at me, he says, “What are they sending children out now?”</span> <span id="s2406">Because I was blonde, blue-eyed blonde, and I looked younger than I was, and I said, “I tell you what,” I said, “You give me carte blanche, and -- I’ll -- I’ll meet your deadline.”</span> <span id="s2407">And he says I -- I -- I says -- excuse me -- “It’s a deal,” he says, “If you do it, I’ll buy you the biggest lobster in Boston.”</span> <span id="s2408">I said, “Okay.”</span> <span id="s2409">Well, Sunday afternoon I call him up, I say, “You better come down here, they’re ready to roll.”</span> <span id="s2410">He comes down there, and he said, “Oh my God.”</span> <span id="s2411">He said, “Come on, I’ll buy you that big lobster.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2412">Q: So you did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2413">A: I did [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2414">Q: Tell me something, this first year that you’re in the United States, do people ask you what happened to you?</span> <span id="s2415">Di --</span></p> <p><span id="s2416">A: Some people, how, isn’t it terrible what they did to you?</span> <span id="s2417">I says, “Please, don’t give me that.</span> <span id="s2418">I -- I went through all that already, so don’t ask me to tell you what happened to me.</span> <span id="s2419">It happened and it’s gone, it’s for -- forget about it.”</span> <span id="s2420">So wha --</span></p> <p><span id="s2421">Q: So you -- you didn’t want to talk about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2422">A: I didn’t want to talk about it, no.</span> <span id="s2423">Even with my family or anybody, I didn’t want to talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2424">Q: Why, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s2425">A: Because I choke up.</span></p> <p><span id="s2426">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s2427">And you still choke up.</span></p> <p><span id="s2428">A: Well, I -- I do high school -- I do schools now.</span></p> <p><span id="s2429">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2430">A: And sometimes I still will choke up, and there wi -- tears roll down.</span></p> <p><span id="s2431">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2432">Do you have dreams about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2433">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2434">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2435">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2436">Q: Do you not watch movies about it?</span> <span id="s2437">You don’t like movies anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s2438">A: I -- I -- I rather don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s2439">Q: You rather don’t.</span> <span id="s2440">Do you read?</span></p> <p><span id="s2441">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2442">Q: Is it about -- about the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s2443">A: Well, I read about certain individuals who, you know, professors who wrote and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2444">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2445">A: [indecipherable] and stuff like that, and he -- he -- how -- how they got through the war, and you know, the -- how this family, I just read a book, I don’t remember the name.</span> <span id="s2446">This family was religious and this one girl there was a rebel, and on and on, and then she met somebody and he was -- what do you call it -- got drafted into Hungarian army, and being he was a Jew, was [indecipherable] so he ran away, he -- and so you know, and then he got -- he never got into concentration camp, but he hid someplace, and -- it was an interesting story.</span></p> <p><span id="s2447">Q: So, when you came to the United States, you certainly noticed that there was a great deal of racism in the United States.</span> <span id="s2448">Did this make you worry about what kind of a country it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s2449">A: I was -- I had blinders on.</span></p> <p><span id="s2450">Q: You like -- really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2451">A: I had blinders on.</span> <span id="s2452">And a couple of times when somebody [indecipherable] the Jews come over, the refugees come over, trying to take over, and I kind of got nasty about it, you know, and -- but that’s a -- I didn’t make an issue out of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2453">Q: And did you see from the -- what happened to African Americans, to black people in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s2454">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2455">Q: Did you wonder what sort of a country this was?</span></p> <p><span id="s2456">A: Well, I worked with some of them, you know, in shop.</span> <span id="s2457">Some of them were frankly, real -- really nice.</span> <span id="s2458">But some of them were really sometimes were more anti-Semitic than anybody else, the blacks.</span> <span id="s2459">A-And after awhile I lost sympathy because of that.</span> <span id="s2460">I said here is a -- here are people who are being persecuted, an-and now they’re hating Jews and, you know, it does not -- it doesn’t make any sense.</span> <span id="s2461">So I lost sympathy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2462">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2463">A: But some of them, you know, a lot of them were nice, they’re -- they’re qualified.</span> <span id="s2464">I had -- I had a guy who worked for me up in Horseheads, and he worked in the machine shop, and then I made him a foreman.</span> <span id="s2465">And after awhile he saw me on the street, and he came over, and he hugged me, he says [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2466">“You’re the first guy who gave me a break, and I was able to get a good job because I had all that background.”</span> <span id="s2467">You know?</span> <span id="s2468">And I said all -- I -- I had a few guys working.</span> <span id="s2469">One of -- one of them was really a -- I -- I never could get mad at him, because he was always funny.</span> <span id="s2470">He was a lousy worker, but he was -- I couldn’t get -- ever get mad at him.</span> <span id="s2471">Whenever I would bawl him out, he would always come with jokes and laughing.</span> <span id="s2472">I says, “Get out of here.”</span>

id="s2507">Q: You didn’t?</span> <span id="s2508">So they knew nothing about your history?</span></p> <p><span id="s2509">A: No.</span> <span id="s2510">They knew that I was a survivor.</span></p> <p><span id="s2511">Q: They did?</span></p> <p><span id="s2512">A: They knew I was a survivor, but thi -- I never talked about what, where, when and how.</span></p> <p><span id="s2513">Q: And they didn’t ask?</span></p> <p><span id="s2514">A: Now they know because I showed them the Spielberg tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s2515">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2516">A: But</span></p> <p><span id="s2517">Q: But before that --</span></p> <p><span id="s2518">A: Before --</span></p> <p><span id="s2519">Q: -- and that was ’96.</span> <span id="s2520">So all these years --</span></p> <p><span id="s2521">A: All these years I -- I couldn’t -- I couldn’t get myself to talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2522">Q: And they probably were shy to say -- to ask you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2523">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2524">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2525">A: Although my wife used to tell them, if your father doesn’t want to talk about it, then just leave him alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s2526">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2527">Did you talk about it with your wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s2528">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2529">Q: Did she talk to them about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2530">A: She would tell them that I was in concentration camp, and I went through hell, but no details.</span></p> <p><span id="s2531">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2532">A: No details.</span></p> <p><span id="s2533">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2534">Okay, let -- we’ll change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s2535">End of Tape Five</span></p>

ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s2539">Q: So it was very late, af -- after that interview with the Shoah Foundation?</span></p> <p><span id="s2540">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2541">Q: Why did you agree to do that interview do you think, after all these years?</span></p> <p><span id="s2542">A: Well I -- I -- I felt the world should know what was going on, because there was a lot of deniers, and I felt it’s time that we talk up, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2543">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2544">A: -- and that’s what decided me to go to schools also, and talk about it in schools.</span></p> <p><span id="s2545">Q: Do you enjoy doing that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2546">A: Yeah, I -- I enjoy the questions the kids throw at you, you know, and so -- thing is, what -- what gets me more than anything else, everybody wants to see my tattoo.</span> <span id="s2547">Now, people are being tattooed left and right, all over their body, what -- what’s -- what is the big novelty about seeing a ta -- a number tattoo?</span></p> <p><span id="s2548">Q: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2549">A: I don’t know either.</span></p> <p><span id="s2550">Q: Except you didn’t choose to get it, it’s a --</span></p> <p><span id="s2551">A: But that’s -- but that -- that’s the biggest question --</span></p> <p><span id="s2552">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2553">A: -- o-of curiosity, to see my tattoo.</span></p> <p><span id="s2554">Q: Huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2555">A: So.</span></p> <p><span id="s2556">Q: And what do they do when they see it?</span> <span id="s2557">Do they just --</span></p> <p><span id="s2558">A: They get oh, oh --</span></p> <p><span id="s2559">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2560">A: So -- does it --</span></p> <p><span

up, did you this, did you that, you know, stuff like that.</span> <span id="s2565">You know, children’s curiosity --</span></p> <p><span id="s2566">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2567">A: -- you know, youngsters can --</span></p> <p><span id="s2568">Q: And you speak mainly to -- to children that -- where, middle school kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s2569">A: Middle school, basically middle school.</span></p> <p><span id="s2570">Q: Not -- not high school kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s2571">A: One hi -- I did one high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s2572">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2573">Do you prefer talking with the younger kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s2574">A: Yeah, I -- I prefer to.</span> <span id="s2575">Their -- their minds are a little more open.</span></p> <p><span id="s2576">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2577">A: They’re more curiosity, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2578">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2579">A: -- more questions that -- ki-kids in high school, they think they know it all by this time, you know, their -- and my daughters weren’t any different.</span> <span id="s2580">They thought we were dummies, and they knew all the answers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2581">Q: I see, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2582">A: You know, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s2583">Q: How long did you live in New York City with your wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s2584">A: Let me see, we moved out 1966.</span></p> <p><span id="s2585">Q: Oh, so you were there a long time?</span></p> <p><span id="s2586">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2587">Q: 16 years.</span> <span id="s2588">And is that when you moved to upper New York State?</span></p> <p><span id="s2589">A: Yeah, because that time, A&amp;P was building that huge facility, and I was sent up there to organize it, and hire skilled mechanics, and carpenters, electricians, started --</span></p> <p><span id="s2590">Q: To start up.</span></p> <p><span id="s2591">A: -- you know, to get the ball rolling.</span></p> <p><span id="s2592">Q: Had you started working for A&amp;P when you were in New York City?</span></p> <p><span id="s2593">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2594">I worked for them -- well, I -- I worked for this -- I told you, for a dollar and a quarter, this outfit?</span></p> <p><span id="s2595">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2596">A: And I worked for them, and they were also not paying very well, the wa -- the times are going on, and you know, yo-you’re looking forward to better yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s2597">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2598">A: And A&amp;P that time, well they were in Brooklyn, and we were in Brooklyn also, the plant.</span> <span id="s2599">We installed a lot of equipment over there, and they couldn’t make it go, they actually got calls all the time, this is no good, this [indecipherable] guys didn’t do right, and so I would go down there and find out what their problem is.</span> <span id="s2600">And little silly things that just -- so one day I said, “You guys are the biggest dummies in the world,” I said.</span> <span id="s2601">“You can’t figure out what’s wrong over here?”</span> <span id="s2602">I says, “Why don’t you get somebody over here who -- who will show you how to do this?”</span> <span id="s2603">He says, “Yeah,” he said, “why don’t you come to work for us?”</span> <span id="s2604">I said, “I will not.”</span> <span id="s2605">So I said, “I don’t want to work for you guys.”</span> <span id="s2606">Well, [indecipherable] they kept calling my wife, they called my mother-in-law, they found out where my mother-in-law lives, and bubba, and everybody, they bugging me, you know, to -- I said, “Okay, I’ll co -- I’ll come to work there.”</span> <span id="s2607">Meantime where I was working, “Oh, we’ll make you a foreman over here,” and you -- “don-don’t leave us because you are good wh-what -- what you are doing, and blah, blah, blah.”</span> <span id="s2608">So I said, “Well you guys aren’t paying enough, so I’ll go over there.”</span> <span id="s2609">And so I went to A&amp;P and I worked over there for about two, or two and a half years.</span> <span id="s2610">And I read in the paper there’s a job really paying well, it was in 19 -- I think it was in ’52.</span> <span id="s2611">And I took that job, and it was designing and setting up printing presses for newspapers and magazines.</span> <span id="s2612">So I went for an interview and I got the job, and I worked there for -- well, I think it was about 11 months.</span> <span id="s2613">In 11 months I made over 9,000 dollars.</span> <span id="s2614">That time was a lot of money, in ’52.</span> <span id="s2615">So -- but they then decided -- the union decided -- and I wasn’t part of it -- to go on strike.</span> <span id="s2616">And the boss tells me, “Al,” he says, “after the strike, we going to have to lay off almost everybody because we lost a lot of business.”</span> <span id="s2617">So then I went out to -- Monday morning I went out for interviews.</span> <span id="s2618">So I saw there was AT &amp; T, Crucible Steel, and Colgate Palmolive had ads.</span> <span id="s2619">So first I went to Colgate, with a line up of about 50 people.</span> <span id="s2620">So I finally got to the line there, and, “Okay,” he says, “come on in the engineering office.”</span> <span id="s2621">I says -- “and I want you to read this, showing how you would go about it.”</span> <span id="s2622">So I said okay.</span> <span id="s2623">So I went over, and then they brought me in the plant, and in the machine shop, and how would you handle this, and -- in the plant how would you handle this [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2624">I said, “Okay, thank you.”</span> <span id="s2625">Then I went to Crucible Steel, and they did a -- test me also, and I says, okay.</span> <span id="s2626">And then I went to AT &amp; T, and AT &amp; T was a lab, and they said they would hire me, but that was about two o’clock in the afternoon, I wasn’t too far from the A&amp;P plant, so I went down there, and I went to personnel, I said, “I want to talk to my -- Olie Turgison,” who was my boss with -- before I left.</span> <span id="s2627">He says -- so the guy down there says, “He doesn’t want to talk to you, you left over here.”</span> <span id="s2628">I said, “Just call him up and tell him I want to talk to him.”</span> <span id="s2629">So he came down here, “Oh come on, I’ll buy you a cup of coffee.”</span> <span id="s2630">And he asked me, “What are you doing?”</span> <span id="s2631">I said, “Well I think I -- I think I got a job at Colgate Palmolive, th-they pay the most, and they are -- and I feel that’s a good company to work for.”</span> <span id="s2632">So he says, “Well, how would you like to come to work for us?”</span> <span id="s2633">I said -- I told him what Colgate is paying, and, “If you guys can meet Colgate’s salary, I’ll come to work for you.”</span> <span id="s2634">The next morning, Tuesday morning I get a call at nine o’clock or so, he said -- he -- he told me he has to talk to the big boss.</span> <span id="s2635">He says, “Where the heck are you,” he said, “you’re supposed to be working over here since eight o’clock in the morning,” he says, “it’s nine o’clock, you should have been here.”</span> <span id="s2636">I says okay.</span> <span id="s2637">So I went down there, and then I got promoted a couple of times with A&amp;P, and that’s when they send me up to Horseheads, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2638">Q: And so you were there for a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2639">A: Yeah, I was there for a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2640">Q: And how did you get to Florida?</span></p> <p><span id="s2641">A: Well my daughter, younger daughter just finished college, and we were buying the New York Times to look for a job for her, and while I was helping her find a job, I come across -- and there is a job over here, maintenance manager to s -- what do you call it, to run a facility in Florida, Tropicana.</span> <span id="s2642">So my wife -- I -- I open up my mouth, I said [indecipherable], I said, “is a job that suits me to a T.” So my wife wants to know where is it.</span> <span id="s2643">I said, “Oh, it’s down in Florida.”</span> <span id="s2644">“Where in Florida?”</span> <span id="s2645">I said, “Bradenton.”</span> <span id="s2646">“Aren’t you going to apply for it?”</span> <span id="s2647">I said no.</span> <span id="s2648">So right away my daughter starts that, “Mom wants to go to Florida, why don’t you apply for it?”</span> <span id="s2649">“I don’t want to.”</span> <span id="s2650">So they worked on me all day long.</span> <span id="s2651">It was on a Sunday.</span> <span id="s2652">Finally in the evening, I said, “If you do a cover letter, I’ll fi -- I’ll make up a resume, and we’ll send it in.”</span> <span id="s2653">And who the heck wants a 50 year old guy to run a facility?</span> <span id="s2654">Well, p.s. -- we dropped it off in the mail on Monday, and Friday morning they called my house, and my wife says y -- I’m at work.</span> <span id="s2655">Can they call me at work?</span> <span id="s2656">And she says, “No.”</span> <span id="s2657">she says, “you give me your phone number, he’ll call you back.”</span> <span id="s2658">So I called them back and we had a long -- well over an hour on the phone and they wanted me come down for an interview.</span> <span id="s2659">And I flew down there on a Friday afternoon, because I told them I’m not going to waste any of my job over here and spend days down there loaf -- you know, goofing off.</span> <span id="s2660">I said, “If you want me, I’ll come down for f -- an interview for Saturday.”</span> <span id="s2661">So they left a car in -- out -- in -- near the ho -- in the hotel where I was staying, with the instruction how to get there, and I got there, was about nine o’clock, and the interview was over about noon time.</span> <span id="s2662">I asked can they get me a real estate guy, and they said yes, and they -- I looked around, and I liked the area, and I told them what it would take to get me, and Tuesday I got a call, how soon can you make it?</span> <span id="s2663">And that’s how I got to Florida.</span></p> <p><span id="s2664">Q: And you stayed there from 1966 until you retired, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s2665">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2666">So that’s how -- it was -- it was a nice -- it was -- I’ll tell you, it was really hard, an-and tough in the beginning, then -- after awhile, because the job that I took, was 11 guys in nine years had that job.</span> <span id="s2667">Nobody could handle it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2668">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2669">A: And when I took the job, they -- I was told that they were taking bets on me how long I’m going to last.</span> <span id="s2670">I sis -- somebody said three months, and they gave -- maximum would be six months, and after all -- I’ll be gone by then.</span> <span id="s2671">But I fooled them all.</span></p> <p><span id="s2672">Q: Why was it so difficult?</span></p> <p><span id="s2673">A: Because was a tough job, it was -- and it was really p -- really poorly organized, and everything else, and the equipment wasn’t maintained properly, so when I got in there I started to redesign the equipment, and build my own equipment, you know, to improve everything else.</span> <span id="s2674">And things started to hum.</span> <span id="s2675">Pro-Productivity --</span></p> <p><span id="s2676">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2677">A: -- was starting to go up.</span> <span id="s2678">And the first few months, my wife used to tell me, “Why don’t you take a cot and sleep over there,” she said, “y-you’re always on call.</span> <span id="s2679">You come home, you don’t even sit down to eat, the phone is ringing.”</span> <span id="s2680">So it took about six months, and -- and then things started to calm down and straighten out and I got a nice raise after six months, and -- Tropicana treated me well.</span> <span id="s2681">I got promoted -- from there I got promoted to manager of project engineering.</span> <span id="s2682">And I was on -- that was job -- best job I ever had because I had no responsibility.</span> <span id="s2683">All I did was critique everybody else’s engineering work.</span> <span id="s2684">I was the manager, and going over all the prints and designs, and -- but all of a sudden, I was on a golf course, I got a call, my boss wants to see me immediately.</span> <span id="s2685">So my wife called the golf course up and got a message to me I’d better get home.</span> <span id="s2686">And I got home, I said, “What’s the matter?”</span> <span id="s2687">She says, “Brent wants to t -- see you right away.</span> <span id="s2688">But he’s home now, so why don’t you go to his house and see what he wants?”</span> <span id="s2689">So I got down there, he says, “How would you like to have a big promotion?”</span> <span id="s2690">I says, “I’ll take anything as long as it’s more money, I’ll take it.”</span> <span id="s2691">So he says, “You’ll be director of manufacturing.</span> <span id="s2692">And that means you’ll have carte blanche, you can hire and fire anybody.</span> <span id="s2693">It’s five departments.”</span> <span id="s2694">It’s -- really I had 600 some odd people under me.</span> <span id="s2695">I had five departments, about 30 supervisors, and that’s what I --</span></p> <p><span id="s2696">Q: That’s fantastic.</span> <span id="s2697">Are you bitter at all about the years that you spent in Europe under the Nazis?</span></p> <p><span id="s2698">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2699">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2700">A: If I be bitter, then I be eating myself alive.</span> <span id="s2701">And I don’t want to do that.</span> <span id="s2702">I had some German guys working for me, and we became friends.</span> <span id="s2703">I was invited -- we were invited to -- my wife and I, to their house, and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s2704">And we -- you just can’t -- you can’t hate th-the rest of your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s2705">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2706">A: If you do then -- then you’re a loser.</span> <span id="s2707">It’s easy to hate, and it’s a -- but you just can’t do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2708">Q: Is there anything else you’d like to say that I haven’t asked you about, or that you’d like to say?</span></p> <p><span id="s2709">A: Yeah, well all -- all I can tell you is in the States I -- we -- I -- I -- I worked hard, I studied hard.</span> <span id="s2710">I had a happy marriage.</span> <span id="s2711">Unfortunately, my wife passed away, and that -- that -- that kind of hit me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2712">Q: You were married for more than 50 years, that’s just --</span></p> <p><span id="s2713">A: No, t -- three months shy of 50.</span></p> <p><span id="s2714">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2715">A: And no -- we were -- we were very happy together, and the kids, and we were always doing things together, going places, and doing all kinds of things, and had a good life.</span></p> <p><span id="s2716">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2717">A: And -- and -- and that -- you know, never had any problems or sickness, and all that stuff, everybody.</span> <span id="s2718">My kids, you know, the ji -- the usual problems with kids, you know, sore throats, earaches, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2719">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2720">A: -- but otherwise, everything was just --</span></p> <p><span id="s2721">Q: But no serious illnesses in the family --</span></p> <p><span id="s2722">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2723">Q: -- so you were very lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s2724">A: So, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2725">Q: So her dying was a shock that was just --</span></p> <p><span id="s2726">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2727">Q: -- she wasn’t sick?</span></p> <p><span id="s2728">A: No, she wasn’t sick, but all of a sudden, she had problems.</span> <span id="s2729">She had -- she had a pain in the -- over here, and we went to the doctor, and found out her lungs -- they took x-rays -- her lungs are filled up with fluid.</span> <span id="s2730">So they decided -- they kept -- emptied out -- pumped out the fluid, and two weeks later the same thing filled up, so they decided, went to a doctors again, they decided to open up and see what’s causing it.</span> <span id="s2731">They found out she has pancreatic cancer.</span></p> <p><span id="s2732">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2733">A: And by -- and this was after Thanksgiving.</span> <span id="s2734">By January 30th, she was gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s2735">Q: So that was a big shock to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2736">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2737">Q: And to the kids, I imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s2738">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2739">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2740">A: And the kids -- the grandkids [indecipherable] and I was really surprised by the kids, because you know, I took all the jewelry that belonged to my wife and stuff, and I put it down, and here, you guys do -- you know, do whatever you want.</span> <span id="s2741">And I -- I expect that maybe there’ll be some arguments or something.</span> <span id="s2742">And I felt, if there is an argument, then I just stop it, and can’t have nothing.</span> <span id="s2743">I want this, oh then I’ll take this, I want this, I’ll take this and on and on, and not even one squabble, or anything.</span> <span id="s2744">And I felt that was really und -- you know, nice that I didn’t have any arguments, because you hear about families --</span></p> <p><span id="s2745">Q: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s2746">A: -- fighting, you know.</span> <span id="s2747">I want this, or you can’t have this because I want this, and so on and on, so -- so that -- that was a good
