time thinking going to the United States.</span> <span id="s62">And maybe we go back little bit because 1939 start war and 1939 I was mobilized to special army unit.</span> <span id="s63">We fortificate, we build the forts reinforcing concrete forts against the Germans in north part of Poland where was on this small river, very dangerous, small deep river, we build our Polish fortification.</span> <span id="s64">And this fortification was going up to 17 September 1939.</span> <span id="s65">And first bomb German drop was not Warsaw, the other place, was our (?)</span> <span id="s66">where we fortificate on our fortification and German army start in fight Poland and our unit go back to east to Russian Soviet border and this was seventeen days like this and meantime the Soviet throw from the plane information all units stop fighting with the Russians and Germans and go.</span> <span id="s67">We are your friends.</span> <span id="s68">In September 17, the Russian-Soviet army invite in Poland no declaration of war and give us the knife in our army from the back.</span> <span id="s69">And that was very upset and we was very scared what happened.</span> <span id="s70">Because two big colossus from German sixteen million and from Russian eighteen million we have absolutely no chance.</span> <span id="s71">And Russians took all our -- 17 September -- couple of days we were fighting with small group, pro-Soviet group, Communist group in this area close to East Polish border and near the Lithuanian border in {Orani} that was less small fighting and Russian Soviet tanks was surround our group and we was forced to surrender.</span> <span id="s72">After Soviet took our unit and arrested, start selection.</span> <span id="s73">Some old officers were sent on one side and later this officer was killed in (?}</span> <span id="s74">.</span> <span id="s75">Some group was selected young people like me and with the future, army officers, I was trained future army officers on other side.</span> <span id="s76">And people who was rank not with the privates were sent home.</span> <span id="s77">And we were arrested and first night I was with my other friends in one room in barn and some fellow who, Soviet, who took the guards, let us go during the night after I give my watch and twenty Polish zloty because was couple hundred people there and this fellow took for us and six guys, we went out.</span> <span id="s78">We divide in six groups and I took with my friend from Warsaw and we go west to Warsaw because this place was very close to Russian border.</span> <span id="s79">And two guys go north and went to Lithuania and later there to Sweden and from Sweden to England and fight against the Germans there.</span> <span id="s80">We were not so lucky because we must cross the Bug River and go to Warsaw and we did this and was very hard, very dangerous because there were so many Communist sympathizers who start threat our military men, we were in uniform.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: Still in uniform?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: Uniform, it was very dangerous.</span> <span id="s83">We tried to go through the night through the woods going west because we were scared about the Communist and between the Polish Communists were very many Jewish Communists.</span> <span id="s84">Was very danger, not only for Polish, for Jewish people was danger.</span> <span id="s85">Communists were working with the Soviets.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: Were there a lot of Communists in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: Not too many was Communists in Poland and still was some and very funny thing, after the war the Communists go to Russia and was killed later there by (?)</span> <span id="s88">because was (?)</span> <span id="s89">saying this are spies [shpyons]for west.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: Why do you suppose these people sided with the Communists?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: I think this was like all over the world, people thinking what is nice in the book, what is nice in ideology probably is nice in practice, and never was.</span> <span id="s92">That happened right now in Russia after 70 years old nobody like to be Communists because Communists was only good for some small group people who are on the top.</span> <span id="s93">This was nothing else like dictatorship.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: What did they teach you in school about Russia and the Communists?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: Excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: When you were going to school in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: In school nobody special talk about the Communists and we know from the press, from the life, from the discussion what is in Russia.</span> <span id="s98">But nobody know live in America what was in Russia.</span> <span id="s99">We know.</span> <span id="s100">I born almost anti-Communist because I feel myself I am Christian, I am a Catholic.</span> <span id="s101">I feel if I have two hands I must do everything what is possible good for me and for other people and I never grabbed the hand and steal somebody or kill somebody for something what I like have.</span> <span id="s102">I was born anti-Communist and I’m glad right now I live so long and the Communist fell down.</span> <span id="s103">That’s very bad ideology and not practical.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: So were you able to get back to Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: After one, two months together with my friend we found Warsaw, family living in Warsaw very bad condition because house was destroyed.</span> <span id="s106">And from there our family start rebuild.</span> <span id="s107">Was all time very -- my father was very, mother too, very hard working people, very ambition, and very good Catholics and try to rebuild our family again and we start again, business, and we go through the occupation time.</span> <span id="s108">I was arrested couple times from 1940 to 1944.</span> <span id="s109">Was couple reason.</span> <span id="s110">Each day in Warsaw was killed hundred people because Poland was fighting against the German, not against the German against the Nazi.</span> <span id="s111">That’s a big difference -- Nazi and German.</span> <span id="s112">And we special our young people was very anxious fight with German.</span> <span id="s113">Once I was arrested after I help some Jewish people.</span> <span id="s114">The girl bring to my father factory some small needle what we need for production.</span> <span id="s115">And we bought from this girl.</span> <span id="s116">We know the girl are from Jewish family and was very nice person.</span> <span id="s117">We bought and after couple days the girls come back and after the girls come back the German criminal Polizei arrest me and start searching our house, my father, mother house, because I live with parents at this time and working for my father in factory and was one of the first arrested.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: What was the charge?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: Charge was what kind connection I have with the Jewish people, why I help and was against some very interesting situation.</span> <span id="s120">My mother speak German and start asking the fellows why you are arrested my son did nothing and the fellows search, the other three guys search our house and find in my drawer couple twenty dollars gold and the chief who take the search give me the paper and prepare something in German what I sign and was I found in house in Rome occupied by (?)</span> <span id="s121">twenty dollars so many pieces.</span> <span id="s122">And I sign.</span> <span id="s123">And the fellow was from criminal Polizei, criminal police.</span> <span id="s124">And after moment the fellow go down from third our floor to street.</span> <span id="s125">My mother started crying and asked release my son.</span> <span id="s126">And the fellow took the gold pieces not show the other guy who searched and released me.</span> <span id="s127">I come back to my house.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: Was it illegal to have those gold pieces?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: Was not illegal and this was really value that we can do something, buy something to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: How did you get the gold pieces?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: Oh that’s no problem because this time in Warsaw mostly the gold was valuable thing and you can buy and sell and something like this, you know, and it was in my family, we was not poor people, you know, and that was one, and I never saw the girl again, she was killed or sent to concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: When did this happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: This was happened 1942 something like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: So when there was a ghetto…</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: Ghetto was already open and second arrest by Gestapo was I was across the border to ghetto many times because we buy some small part of the machinery what we own and before the war all the supply was in the ghetto area and we was forced buy something because we cannot work with this and we receive from Gestapo some paper we can go to ghetto.</span> <span id="s136">And meantime if I go to ghetto I take all time something to eat to people who live there, sandwiches or some bread or something like this and one very bad SS man on the border…</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: Checkpoint.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: Checkpoint start checking me and so I have some sandwiches and sent me right away to Polish commissariat, mean the Polish prison and from there start not so bad because I was only one night there and I suppose to be sent to working camp in Germany and because my father was connected with underground and Polish police before the war was second was friendly with my father too.</span> <span id="s139">My father took some connection and I was free and I never …(There was a loud bang and interruption)</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: You were talking about your second arrest.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: My second arrest and I was in Polish prison one night and one day and after my father talked to somebody famous in Polish police I was released I was supposed to go to Arbeit Amt to German office and I supposed to send to Germany and never happened.</span> <span id="s142">I was together with family from this.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: When did you get arrested the second time?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: That was the second time.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: What date was thar?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: That was about ’42, ’43.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: The first one was November 1942 and the second?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: Was ’43, something like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: This was before the ghetto rebelled against the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: Before, right.</span> <span id="s151">During this moment you mentioned the ghetto uprising, we was very, very upset and we cannot eat.</span> <span id="s152">I remember this moment we was called and the whole ghetto was burning.</span> <span id="s153">And the smell was so terrible and besides this we know we left there many good people.</span> <span id="s154">I was very close with the Jewish people in ghetto because branch what my father was -- knitting, me.</span> <span id="s155">And in knitting line was many Jewish factories and many Jewish hokseller (?)</span> <span id="s156">what we was connected automatically because it was the business and many Jewish people, X number, very fair playing business men.</span> <span id="s157">Some was bad and some was good and we was very upset after we saw the Warsaw burning.</span> <span id="s158">And before the Warsaw burning my father and me, we took three families from ghetto and we found location, not me, my father mostly --was very good person, very good Christian, and took the Christianity for daily not only during Sunday.</span> <span id="s159">In other words took everything what think is right did.</span> <span id="s160">This moment because we received, father and me, we received special privilege going to ghetto buying something what we need for supplying our machinery.</span> <span id="s161">People were crying please, good people couple good family you know was connected to us and before the war Jewish uprising my father found three places where the people can hire.</span> <span id="s162">One of the places was the Swedish Embassy in Warsaw and there was housekeeper, Polish family, and was very devoted Christian.</span> <span id="s163">And this people said to my father if you have no choice and you are like help the Jewish people we can hire the people.</span> <span id="s164">(Female voice in the background said “hide’).</span> <span id="s165">And my father took some very big risk because only one country on Europe during the war German suggest if somebody hire Jewish be killed on spot, what happened thousand, thousand times.</span> <span id="s166">And still my father took the chance and took the family, Malamed family, Benyamin Malamed and Irena Malamed with two young sons took from ghetto with the housewives what we have and transferred to the Warsaw Swedish Embassy.</span> <span id="s167">These people lived there without the big risk.</span> <span id="s168">After moment where German and Jewish agent start one action where German suggest and propose if Jewish family, Jewish men like be transfer to America or to other country and against the German who was captured by Aryans and pay some money, that is possible.</span> <span id="s169">And this idea was created by agent, Jewish fellow, son of the famous Fabricant in Lodz and this fellow organized with the SS Gestapo some place in Warsaw close to our factory {Duga} Hotel Polski and sent all over the information we transfer Jewish people against the German people in the hands of the Aryans and each person must pay some hundred dollars in gold.</span> <span id="s170">And my family, Mr. Malamed believed this and one day said, I am going to Hotel Polski and I be glad to be transferred to America and from America some German be transferred here who was in hands of American army or some other army, prisoner of war.</span> <span id="s171">And this my friends go there to Hotel Polski and from this moment we lose the track.</span> <span id="s172">After couple weeks we know these people went to some concentration camp on the west and later there we learned that that was Bergen-Belsen because Polish underground look which transport come back and probably some search was done by Polish underground army and we know the people go west and later there we know was in Bergen concentration camp.</span> <span id="s173">After the war 1946 I took couple of days off from duty in American army and I went to Bergen-Belsen, look for my friends.</span> <span id="s174">And I was too late.</span> <span id="s175">Two weeks before I arrived there Malamed family went to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: So they survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: They survived and that’s one family.</span> <span id="s178">We received later there from Palestine and later from Israel many cards from this family, very, very good people.</span> <span id="s179">Now second two family what we did and I was help to father because I was one family member to work with father because I was twenty two years old, I was not young like my brother, sixteen, or my sister, twelve or fifteen.</span> <span id="s180">Second family what we try hide was in Hungary Embassy, very famous place on the corner Aleyawiadofskin and Chopina, Ulica Chopina in Warsaw where the old embassy was before the war two.</span> <span id="s181">And again the supervisor of the whole Hungarian Embassy was my father friend and again my father pleas for the favor hire these people.</span> <span id="s182">And this gentleman said fine and we sent the two family, one was Mr. Landau and wife with son.</span> <span id="s183">Mr. Landau was in our branch, both Jewish people was in the same branch, knitting.</span> <span id="s184">Me.</span> <span id="s185">Landau was owner of the stocking factory in Lodz and we was very good connected.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: So he was from Lodz, not from Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: From Lodz and later there was in Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s188">We know him from Lodz and was in Warsaw ghetto and we took these people, not really we because I not was there, my father created different situation asked some Polish policeman who took the people and bring to the place here supposed to be mean to Hungarian Embassy.</span> <span id="s189">I was couple time there visit.</span> <span id="s190">This was not nice place because was in basement, second basement below the ground level because this was building years, years ago belonged to very famous Polish aristocracy.</span> <span id="s191">And this was below, second floor below the ground because was wine cellar and this people was there for x number of months.</span> <span id="s192">I visit there.</span> <span id="s193">The people receive each couple days special food there and this time you must be very careful buy big amount of food because people think you are single why you buy so much, if it was possible to buy.</span> <span id="s194">And this building was not occupied by nobody because was partly destroyed.</span> <span id="s195">And still my father friend was each day there and watched after the building.</span> <span id="s196">The same talking you know, go to the people and bring him something.</span> <span id="s197">And was very famous situation in Warsaw where maybe you know from the other sources, in Warsaw was SS very brutal man Kutschera, General Kutschera and this animal killed people each day by own hand and was escorted each day by twenty, thirty chairmen with guns and gun prepared to shoot if somebody attacked the SS man Kutschera and main office Kutschera was three buildings from the place where our people was hire in the basement and we was thinking and the people was thinking this is the best place, close to the SS.</span> <span id="s198">And every week was all right.</span> <span id="s199">Only one day Polish underground tried to kill Kutschera because he was a very bad man who killed thousand people and sent to death.</span> <span id="s200">On the corner Chopina where the Embassy was and the Polish underground took the action.</span> <span id="s201">Kutschera was killed.</span> <span id="s202">Many other German was killed and that was good for Polish underground.</span> <span id="s203">And was not good for the people who was in the basement because from this moment all blocks was put with the wire around and nobody could go in and out from the building where was hire the Jewish two family.</span> <span id="s204">Was Mr. like I said before and second family was only one person Mr. Epstein.</span> <span id="s205">And was start problem supply the food for the people in the basement.</span> <span id="s206">And we never go there because later there start Warsaw uprising and the people living in the basement lose the contact.</span> <span id="s207">We know from other people later after Warsaw uprising the people survived all Warsaw uprising and go to scourge (?)</span> <span id="s208">because after Warsaw collapsed the Germans took all people out from Warsaw and go to checkpoint in Geraldof or near the border of Warsaw and select.</span> <span id="s209">And because these people was very, very weak and white color the German SS recognize the people was Jewish and Warsaw uprising mean the march from Warsaw was only family Landau, son and mother and father.</span> <span id="s210">The other, Mr. Epstein, was probably like some people think was killed by Landau family.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: By Landau family?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: Because was not enough food and water.</span> <span id="s213">This I don’t know.</span> <span id="s214">I was not there.</span> <span id="s215">People told to me, only I know the corpse, the body of Mr. Epstein still in the basement in Warsaw on Chopina corner and probably nobody know are buried in the basement there.</span> <span id="s216">That’s story I heard after I come back to Poland from American army and I talked to people who survived the Warsaw uprising.</span> <span id="s217">That was three family, nice people who we tried help.</span> <span id="s218">And I think so we did, people ask me why you did this.</span> <span id="s219">First we are Christians and in our religion if we have chance help somebody, we do.</span> <span id="s220">Not me.</span> <span id="s221">I am love all Jewish people like Mr. Kahana or Mr. Weiss from York, I not like him.</span> <span id="s222">And still if the fellow be on edge of the cliff probably I give him help.</span> <span id="s223">That’s I did in 1943, ’44.</span> <span id="s224">That was about helping people in very brutal situation.</span> <span id="s225">My personal what you like know more, personal; experience in a concentration camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: First of all the Warsaw uprising.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: Warsaw uprising probably you have more, you have tomorrow or today you talk to my brother who was longer in the Warsaw uprising.</span> <span id="s228">Because we was divided, our family, two really three groups.</span> <span id="s229">My brother, younger brother, was in middle Warsaw and what was in the group what was fighting with the Germans and still was the special commando.</span> <span id="s230">Myself and my father we was all the time home, army and we support, we hire you know all paper for print or stuff like this and we give money for underground organization.</span> <span id="s231">And after Warsaw uprising start, in our factory, our building, was all ammunition and the sharp rifles, pistol, and something else.</span> <span id="s232">And I never know that our group was so big because I know only two, three people around me because all organization was do designed I know only couple people.</span> <span id="s233">My father know only couple people.</span> <span id="s234">We never know big circle the people.</span> <span id="s235">And after the Warsaw uprising start our magazine was opened.</span> <span id="s236">And was so many people asked for and has title to ammunition and pistol or something.</span> <span id="s237">Was fifty percent without some gun, ammunition,

cost our life, our people.</span> <span id="s240">The best people was dying.</span> <span id="s241">Quarter million people died during Warsaw uprising, the best.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: When did you join the resistance, the underground?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: We was already two years before in ??</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: So 1942 you…</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: ’40, ’40, ’42 I was already.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: And what about your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: My father was all the time and that was the second group we was in near our factory.</span> <span id="s248">And my intention was after I not receive gun, I was training because during the 1939 I was doing couple months with army.</span> <span id="s249">And I was very upset, I have no gun.</span> <span id="s250">What kind of soldier if I have no gun, nothing.</span> <span id="s251">And the special youngest people was so aggressive and was against the Germans took everything what was in our basement location.</span> <span id="s252">That was not belong to this place too.</span> <span id="s253">In our building and not belong to us was to the group Kalinski

<p><span id="s259">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: Why?</span> <span id="s261">Because I was thinking is too much cost our life and we have gained very little.</span> <span id="s262">Why was my thinking this way?</span> <span id="s263">Because young people who never was in the war don’t know nothing how the war looked.</span> <span id="s264">And 1939 I was in Polish army, I know the Russian army, and I know the German army going from the east to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s265">And special during the Hitler time in Warsaw, ’39, ’44 I was thinking this is fighting with the so big colors, people, so big army, we had no chance.</span> <span id="s266">And Russian army asked Polish underground start fighting with German in 1944, and after we start fighting the Russians never helped us and never asked again start fighting with Germans.</span> <span id="s267">That was my think.</span> <span id="s268">And our group I lose couple of friends in the action and we was in the old part of the Warsaw.</span> <span id="s269">And after the part of Warsaw was collapsed we were supposed to go through the Commouse (?)</span> <span id="s270">below the ground to the middle part of the Warsaw should ?</span> <span id="s271">misht(?)</span> <span id="s272">in.</span> <span id="s273">And we never caused this because we was left?</span> <span id="s274">group was going to ?</span> <span id="s275">us and prevent German going from the ghetto, this area, to however place where we was there.</span> <span id="s276">And after last moment the Commouse was destroyed because Germans put the?</span> <span id="s277">in the?</span> <span id="s278">We had no chance to go to (?)</span> <span id="s279">joint with the other part of the Warsaw underground, uprising unit.</span> <span id="s280">And I went to my mother house and we took our clothes what we was fighting and we changed for civilian clothes.</span> <span id="s281">And that was couple hours.</span> <span id="s282">After couple hours I only eat, dress, wash my hands, and took the other clothes and German start screaming and the whole house rouse.</span> <span id="s283">In other words we must go out from the basement and we must go to outside.</span> <span id="s284">And we did this.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: Who are you now, who are together?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: And we meet together, my mother, my two sister, and the same time, my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: Did he take his uniform off, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: My father was not in uniform.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: So he was not fighting?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: Fighting, yes, organized everything there.</span> <span id="s291">Based Fabricant (?)</span> <span id="s292">where is our factory.</span> <span id="s293">That was very active man.</span> <span id="s294">Only was not, was forty couple years old, and was not fight with what, with stone.</span> <span id="s295">You cannot fight with stone.</span> <span id="s296">And was not enough guns, ammunition, etc.</span> <span id="s297">Was maybe 20 % people with guns and the other was doing nothing.</span> <span id="s298">In middle part of the Warsaw was better organized.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: Where your brother was?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: Yes, that was better prepared for this.</span> <span id="s301">And after this moment we go out from the basement where we lived.</span> <span id="s302">We lived close to the ------- in our house was the church.</span> <span id="s303">And we go out from the basement and (?)</span> <span id="s304">and up and search and we went couple miles by foot to the point where we was sent to train and from train to some special big barracks and we was select there to concentration camp.</span> <span id="s305">During the march from our house to the place where we was sent to the railroad was very bad moment because many Ukrainian people work for Germans and was very, very molested situation.</span> <span id="s306">My mother cannot take the ring, gold ring from the finger and the fellow like cut my mother finger.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: She cut it?</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: Like cut.</span> <span id="s309">And the German soldier said what you doing stupid?</span> <span id="s310">And let my mother go because this old lady cannot take this.</span> <span id="s311">And from this moment we go to Krushkuff near the Warsaw.</span> <span id="s312">That was big old railroad factory and we sleep there one night and we supposed to go someplace.</span> <span id="s313">And we were selected, old people on one side, young people on other.</span> <span id="s314">And my mother was sent on side with the old people and my father and my mother said no, I not leave my children, I go together.</span> <span id="s315">And go with us to group where was selected to concentration camp.</span> <span id="s316">That’s my mother went to concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: Where did the other group go?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: The other group go free.</span> <span id="s319">The others go someplace where we don’t know and was old people was free, sixty, seventy years old, fifty or under.</span> <span id="s320">Young people was sent on one side and was selected to concentration camp.</span> <span id="s321">This was first part where German took old Warsaw.</span> <span id="s322">This time the fighting army was (?)</span> <span id="s323">was called by German like bandit, not fighting people for freedom, like bandit.</span> <span id="s324">Later there the International Red Cross and other sources press the German and the fighting army was equal to prisoner of war.</span> <span id="s325">I was not so lucky, I go to concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: Do you remember when your family was arrested?</span> <span id="s327">Before the battle was finished, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: You mean before the Warsaw uprising?</span> <span id="s329">That was I think about the first of September.</span> <span id="s330">Later there we go to the place and again this was not so lucky because we was in Prushkof the whole family with me, the father, two sister, and me was in Prushkof, the old factory.</span> <span id="s331">And we supposed to go to someplace we don’t know yet at this time.</span> <span id="s332">And I talked to one Austrian fellow with Austrian insignia in German army because I speak German.</span> <span id="s333">I asked him listen, what we can do, we must go from here, and my mother is sick.</span> <span id="s334">And the fellow said, maybe I can help you and said, you can go out if you pay some money in gold.</span> <span id="s335">And we have the gold with us because nobody said (?)</span> <span id="s336">.</span> <span id="s337">And I give for each person twenty gold dollars.</span> <span id="s338">And was everything prepared.</span> <span id="s339">We must go through physician and select like sick people.</span> <span id="s340">And one hour after I talk to this fellow some start “boom” there and SS start screaming, shrying and make noise, everybody out.</span> <span id="s341">Why?</span> <span id="s342">Because from Red Cross International, Red Cross from Sweden and Switzerland, people supposed to see how German treat the people after Warsaw uprising.</span> <span id="s343">And we was pressed going up to the doctor, we was lying to the doctor, and we was take out, kick and push and put in the cars, cow cars, how do you call the transport?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: Cattle cars.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: Right and we was pushed there for so many people.</span> <span id="s346">How many can go in?</span> <span id="s347">And the train goes.</span> <span id="s348">And was two weeks.</span> <span id="s349">I not remember exactly -- was long time.</span> <span id="s350">We go from one place to other and nobody like take us.</span> <span id="s351">Because all concentration camps was full.</span> <span id="s352">And after all, we go so long around Germany, we went in concentration camp Flossenburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: Did they feed you when you were on the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A: Very little.</span> <span id="s355">Very little, and we have with us….</span> <span id="s356">really I don’t remember, I know we have something to eat, our stuff because we took from Warsaw something.</span> <span id="s357">Nobody take from us nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: What about water?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: With water was not so good.</span> <span id="s360">With water I was sick after it.</span> <span id="s361">All transport I was very sick to the stomach.</span> <span id="s362">And I was thinking I die, because why I stay in the transport.</span> <span id="s363">I was like usual very stupid family man.</span> <span id="s364">I was thinking family that is something what is not breakable.</span> <span id="s365">Because was two young sister, my mother and my father.</span> <span id="s366">I was thinking I am the most powerful young fellow and I have not other obligation, I must help my family.</span> <span id="s367">Special I was taught by my father and mother.</span> <span id="s368">My father and mother was four years in World War First in working camp in Germany and said to us, because we was family we survived.</span> <span id="s369">And going to Germany with my family I was thinking the same.</span> <span id="s370">I am the youngest fellow, powerful.</span> <span id="s371">I supposed to help and I help because I know my character.</span> <span id="s372">And happened was not working place only was concentration dead camp where we was there and selected, women Theresienstadt and men stay in Flossenburg.</span> <span id="s373">And after the whole transport we go from Warsaw by this car.</span> <span id="s374">If I have not obligation to my family I go hundred times escape because was not so bad.</span> <span id="s375">During night I can jump because was open.</span> <span id="s376">I can do this.</span> <span id="s377">And I cannot jump and go and lift my mother who was fifty years old and my father and two young girls.</span> <span id="s378">And that was the reason I landed in concentration camp.</span> <span id="s379">After we arrived on Flossenburg I was thinking I die.</span> <span id="s380">After we stopped in one place before Flossenburg, Weiden I asked the fellow who was on the train, give me hot water a little bit because I am very sick.</span> <span id="s381">I speak German and the fellow said fine, I give you.</span> <span id="s382">And give me the steam, after one minute there was water from the steam.</span> <span id="s383">And I drink maybe one a little this and that’s what probably helped me.</span> <span id="s384">And from this moment the locomotive was changed and to this transport the locomotive was connected with SS people.</span> <span id="s385">Because SS people only go to concentration camp with the transport.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: So before then these were German army?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: German railroad men.</span> <span id="s388">Railroad men was like army during the war.</span> <span id="s389">And we went there to concentration camp, Flossenburg and there was so nice sign “Arbeit Macht Frei” mean during the work you can be free.</span> <span id="s390">And there was the selection, women on one side, men on the other.</span> <span id="s391">And start the problem like you know all concentration camp has.</span> <span id="s392">Each day something new, each day people were killed.</span> <span id="s393">People was pushed from the stone, steinbruk from hundred twenty feet high.</span> <span id="s394">On the top, you know, somebody push you to the bottom.</span> <span id="s395">People from the first moment was selection who is engineer on one side, who is physician on other side, and these people who was high educated was killed first, not by bullet, by walking up to knee in the water, very bad condition.</span> <span id="s396">And people who work all time hard and has hard life was prepared to this.</span> <span id="s397">The intelligent people was not prepared.</span> <span id="s398">Each day was somebody from our group to die, die.</span> <span id="s399">And was so many diseases and was terrible.</span> <span id="s400">From our transport, I remember somebody took the numbers, over three and a half thousand people come back only one hundred eighty three people back.</span> <span id="s401">Between the bad people was two friendly American boys who supplied to Warsaw through the air ammunition and guns was shot by German and landed close to our house Mirdova and went with us together to concentration camp Flossenburg and if you go to Flossenburg what I visit couple years ago are how many Polish people died there, was mostly died Polish, Russian, very small Jewish and two Americans.</span> <span id="s402">They died in Flossenburg.</span> <span id="s403">Help Polish people.</span> <span id="s404">And till concentration camp terrible, was very bad, and our camp was governed by criminals, not only SS criminals, and German criminals.</span> <span id="s405">We political because from Warsaw operation was political.</span> <span id="s406">We were called political prisoners.</span> <span id="s407">We was with the red triangle and P.</span> <span id="s408">The other German prisoner, the bandits, was with green.</span> <span id="s409">Other color, some Jewish was blacks (?)</span> <span id="s410">star.</span> <span id="s411">And I tell you one thing, in concentration camp I never think people the prisoner was very friendly each other and never, never I saw or (?)</span> <span id="s412">you re Polish or you are Jewish or you are, for example, French.</span> <span id="s413">Was not so, people think was very bad atmosphere.</span> <span id="s414">We never had bad experience, for example, with French, Jewish, Russian, the same.</span> <span id="s415">We was prisoner.</span> <span id="s416">We experienced the same problem and that’s the story in concentration camp.</span> <span id="s417">Many things I can point out to you about the concentration camp because it was a very brutal moment and depressed.</span> <span id="s418">How many times you go do something somebody push you, the SS or kapo.</span> <span id="s419">Kapo mostly was in our concentration camp was German prisoners, sadist.</span> <span id="s420">And some was Jewish too.</span> <span id="s421">And I cannot say the prisoner was something one against the other.</span> <span id="s422">In my camp was like I said before, General Kenaus was killed and all generals, Italian generals who was against Hitler and Mussolini this time, the group called General (??)</span> <span id="s423">people, generals, age 60-70 was treated very, very badly by not only German, by the prisoners, I don’t know why, the people must have died there.</span> <span id="s424">Because was something this time I did not understand.</span> <span id="s425">In my eye one general was not killed and was very, very bad wounded by one criminals and took a chair and punch the chair on the head.</span> <span id="s426">And each day was terrible.</span> <span id="s427">And problem was the Appel.</span> <span id="s428">It was the Appel and somebody was missing because died already and where is the body, for example, because on Appel we must count the body and live people.</span> <span id="s429">That sometimes takes two hours, three hours before every numbers come together.</span> <span id="s430">I hope I can tell you more.</span> <span id="s431">Many friends from my town, from this group, 3,000, died, because there was not enough eat, was not enough medicine.</span> <span id="s432">I was very lucky, I got some in hospital.</span> <span id="s433">And my father, special, helped many Polish people give some medicine, maybe not help too much and still help some.</span> <span id="s434">After war was end some Russian people, in this concentration camp was 5,000 Russian army officers, and this people was stoned one guy (??)</span> <span id="s435">who was very brutal, beat my father once very badly, and this Russian (?)</span> <span id="s436">took the gun because American army give us the gun.</span> <span id="s437">Shoot if you think so somebody is, give it to him.</span> <span id="s438">Shoot him.</span> <span id="s439">Nobody from Polish group shoot nobody.</span> <span id="s440">The Russian a good many, many, many.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: You mention your father was badly beaten.</span> <span id="s442">Why was he beaten?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: Beaten for no reason, no reason at all.</span> <span id="s444">We go with my father to the Appel Place what we have title to do and Lagerfuhrer go against us and for no reason punch my father in nose and start kicking.</span> <span id="s445">I was shocked.</span> <span id="s446">What I can do?</span> <span id="s447">And my father wake up and said excuse and we go together and my father and said, listen these people can kick me or anybody can.</span> <span id="s448">No reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: So how did you survive?</span> <span id="s450">Looking back what are the reasons for your survival?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: My reason for survival I think was the connection with friend who was from beginning help us, Jan Shienitski because this fellow looked after us.</span> <span id="s452">If I have nobody there I am sure I die.</span> <span id="s453">Besides this I was young, 23, 24 years old.</span> <span id="s454">I was good sportsman, my body was built good and I was feed good before the uprising.</span> <span id="s455">We eat, some people has not food, not enough food or not good food and these people die fast.</span> <span id="s456">That was the reason.</span> <span id="s457">And besides this reason was my mother was, I feel, during my sitting in concentration camp, each evening I prayed to the God, if somebody must die, better me because I am alone, not my mother, not my sisters, not my father because my father has obligations to family, my mother obligation to sisters.</span> <span id="s458">All time I pray.</span> <span id="s459">After I come back from camp, my mother said each day I prayed to God the same.</span> <span id="s460">Let take me, I am the oldest woman and save the children.</span> <span id="s461">Probably something helped us.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: Somebody answered your prayers.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: Yeah, that I think.</span> <span id="s464">And one thing more in the concentration camp if I can mention you, I was in the revier (?)</span> <span id="s465">mean the hospital and my bed was very close to on the other side of the other room was (?)</span> <span id="s466">.</span> <span id="s467">People, die people, after somebody died, the clothes was taking out and the dead people was laying on the floor, they took the other before, dentists take their teeth.</span> <span id="s468">And listen, behind the wall maybe couple hundred corpse there and one day was some shooting from the tower, one of the tower near the crematorium where I lived was shooting and the bullets go all over and we was be killed.</span> <span id="s469">Only the corpse of the dead people catch the bullets, not me.</span> <span id="s470">And what happened, next day we check what happened.</span> <span id="s471">Some Russian prisoner go to the Lichencomer mean the morgue, go there and pick up the gold teeth, stealing the gold teeth from the people.</span> <span id="s472">And the fellow who was on the watching tower saw him and put the reflector, the spot there, and start shooting.</span> <span id="s473">And I was very lucky.</span> <span id="s474">I was behind this corpse of the dead people.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: So they were shooting into your barracks because the Russians had stolen the gold and you were saved by the piles of bodies.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: Any other miracles?</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: Not many kinds on the fight.</span> <span id="s479">I not fight in my life too much and during the concentration camp I fight with fellow the same age like me.</span> <span id="s480">This was Russian Communist young officer who all (?)</span> <span id="s481">said don’t worry, Pole, Poland never be free.</span> <span id="s482">Be seventeenth Russian Republic.</span> <span id="s483">And I was very patriotic.</span> <span id="s484">I said you crazy, you stupid, Poland be free again.</span> <span id="s485">And we start fighting.</span> <span id="s486">And each couple day was the same.</span> <span id="s487">And I never fight with other people.</span> <span id="s488">I fight with him.</span> <span id="s489">And now after so many years my fight was right, Poland is free, Russian Communists is dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: Is that a good time to end?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: No, I think so.</span> <span id="s492">We got much more time, I think so now.</span> <span id="s493">I was not prepared for this….</span> <span id="s494">.</span> <span id="s495">select….</span> <span id="s496">.</span></p>
