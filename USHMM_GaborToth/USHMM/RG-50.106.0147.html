Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Margitta Cooper conducted by Gail Schwartz on January 4th, 2002 at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.</span> <span id="s4">This is tape number one, side A.</span> <span id="s5">What is your full name?</span></p> <p><span id="s6">Answer: Including maiden a -- Margitta Granberg Grunberg Cooper.</span></p> <p><span id="s7">Q: And where were you born and when were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s8">A: I was born June the 10th, 1929 in Speyer, Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">Q: Let’s talk a little bit about your family.</span> <span id="s10">Tell me about your parents and their background, how long they had been there.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">A: My father was one of the religious leaders in the town, he was also the cantor cum rabbi.</span> <span id="s12">He was born in Poland.</span> <span id="s13">My mother was a -- a young woman who married -- in her day, who could -- never had a career, of course, she married from her mother’s house, married my father.</span> <span id="s14">He had been married before, he was a young widower, as a matter of fact, when she married him.</span> <span id="s15">She -- how they met I never knew because there was some romantic story that she had gone to visit a friend and he met her and he fell in love with her.</span> <span id="s16">I don’t know, I’m sure that’s about it.</span> <span id="s17">Probably a blind date.</span> <span id="s18">Anyway, they married, they had one child, who died.</span> <span id="s19">My sister died when she was 10 years old, which was a devastating event for my parents.</span> <span id="s20">And, as a matter of fact, if it had not been for the death of my sister, I probably -- my brother and I would not have been born -- we were twins.</span> <span id="s21">So in considering my father and his philosophy, he -- it had to be somewhat ironic for him to have lost a child and then have twins born.</span> <span id="s22">At any rate, that’s how we arrived, and I think we had a n -- very nice life, a very nice home.</span> <span id="s23">Stable.</span> <span id="s24">I mean, I felt no anxiety or fear, at least not until I was about five years old, when it became more difficult to be a Jew in Germany and I think that’s an old story.</span> <span id="s25">And the children, I think, more than the adults, began to react to my brother and I as Jews, even though there were still children who were not Jewish, Christian children who would play with us, because there was a park in front of our home.</span> <span id="s26">I had Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s27">I was a child that had -- my brother and I -- more m-me, because my brother was very well behaved.</span> <span id="s28">I always had the feeling that I had to be very well behaved.</span> <span id="s29">I was a special child because of my father and certain conduct was expected of me, so that was difficult.</span> <span id="s30">It was a very religious home.</span> <span id="s31">My father was a relig -- i-i-in -- in the sense that it was strictly Orthodox.</span> <span id="s32">My mother was, I think -- I don’t know how sh -- exactly what her beliefs were, but certainly she -- she upheld whatever my father wanted to do in a -- in -- in the marriage.</span> <span id="s33">She was a very nervous woman because of my sister’s death.</span> <span id="s34">I think that was a terrible trauma for her.</span> <span id="s35">So when I think of what ultimately happened to my mother, it’s unbearable to think that this woman who had -- ended up her life the way it eventually did.</span> <span id="s36">And that I find probably the most unforgivable thing about this whole situation that happened in Germany.</span> <span id="s37">And let me say now, at the outset, that what happened in Germany, while it was unique in the history of the world, notwithstanding great sieges, great battles and great suffering among other peoples of the world, I have come to the conclusions after many, many years of thinking about it, that whatever happened in Germany could happen anyplace, given certain economic and cultural events, and that it is singularly inappropriate for -- for people to be smug and say well, you know, this is -- these are the people that were able to do it.</span> <span id="s38">I think all peoples are capable of doing it.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: What were your parents’ names?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: My mother’s name was Anna Rosenthal Greenberg.</span> <span id="s41">She was born Irena Bayata, but they called her Anna.</span> <span id="s42">My father was Benjamin Greenberg and they called him Benno Greenberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: And -- and your brother’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: My -- my brother’s name was Heinz and he was my twin and he now lives in Florida and he’s a grandfather.</span> <span id="s45">So I mean, you know, it’s wonderful, when you think about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: And tell me a little bit about your late sister.</span> <span id="s47">What was her name and what did she die of?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: My -- my sister’s name was Margot and she was absolutely exquisite, I have a picture of her.</span> <span id="s49">She was angelic.</span> <span id="s50">Not only because she died, because people become angelic after they’re dead, but from -- everybody said that she was just a sweet and gentle child.</span> <span id="s51">And her death not only devastated my parents, but I think my mother’s brothers, her uncles and my -- my grandmother, and I think that -- she was really beautiful.</span> <span id="s52">I mean, she looked like the Rosenthals.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: Wha-What did she die of?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: Diphtheria.</span> <span id="s55">She was fine.</span> <span id="s56">They had sent her to Switzerland to reco -- recuperate, and I think from what now that -- I was in the medical field a little bit for -- for a long time, she -- I think they must have given her digitalis to strengthen the heart, and I think they o -- overdosed and I think it killed her.</span> <span id="s57">She was only 10 years old.</span> <span id="s58">So I think that’s precisely what happened, although, you know, it was so long ago, I mean, was 1928, so it’s difficult to -- but they did bring back the body from Switzerland -- it had to be a -- a frightful event for my parents.</span> <span id="s59">And -- but as I said, you know, my childhood was pretty normal.</span> <span id="s60">I was -- after the -- do you want to hear this?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: Well, let me ask you a little bit more before we get to the --</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: -- the -- to the -- the 30’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: -- or the mid-30’s.</span> <span id="s66">What kind of neighborhood did you live in, was it a Jewish neighborhood, or a mixed neighborhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s68">It was a Jewish neighborhood.</span> <span id="s69">It was a very nice neighborhood, you know, each house was individual, had land around it.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: You were right in the center of the city?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s72">I would have thought it was more -- it was not a big -- I mean Speyer is -- is -- it was a fairly well known city, it had a very famous cathedral and it had the Speyer [indecipherable] there was something with Luther that was there, too.</span> <span id="s73">I think it was more toward the outskirts.</span> <span id="s74">It was a very residential area and there were lots of Jews living in that area.</span> <span id="s75">There were some Christians too, but they would have been across the park.</span> <span id="s76">And there was a beautiful church not too far from us and then there were a cluster of homes there, too, that I think belonged to Christian families.</span> <span id="s77">But where I lived, our neighbors were Jewish.</span> <span id="s78">The interesting thing was that maybe 20 yards from us, around the corner, was what is known as a -- it was like, not barracks for soldiers, but like a building that housed soldiers.</span> <span id="s79">You know, army soldiers, not SS or Nazi.</span> <span id="s80">And that was very -- that was strange, because i-it -- right in -- in this area they had what is called a -- a -- I don’t remember what it was called in Germany -- in German, but they had soldiers living there, training, being trained there.</span> <span id="s81">So I used to watch them when I was little, and we -- they were very friendly then.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: You had mentioned extended family.</span> <span id="s83">Did you have quite a bit of relatives, cousins, aunts, uncles, grandparents?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: I had a grandmother who lived in Gimbsheim, where my mother was -- where my mother was born.</span> <span id="s85">My mother had two brothers.</span> <span id="s86">One was a bachelor all his life and came to the United States in the late 30’s, 1939.</span> <span id="s87">And she also had a younger brother who was married and I had one cousin.</span> <span id="s88">And then there were various assorted second cousins.</span> <span id="s89">My mother -- my grandmother was widowed when she was like, in her late 20’s, from -- you know.</span> <span id="s90">And -- but she had a brother who came to this country as a young man.</span> <span id="s91">Now, I have family that live in Wichita, Kansas, too.</span> <span id="s92">So, I mean, you know, it’s the old story about emigration and -- and -- and families and intermarriages and -- and -- but we -- we -- it was nice.</span> <span id="s93">I -- I -- it was a nice -- it was -- it was a nice -- it was a nice life for a child and certainly it had to be for my parents, you know, because they had a position in the community and -- and that wa -- that was --</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: You said your father was a cantor, was that his full time work?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: Work, yeah, plus he was educating all the young -- youngsters.</span> <span id="s96">He also educ -- you know, he also had classes.</span> <span id="s97">He also trained all the boys for their Bar Mitzvahs, plus he had Sunday School, that he ran.</span> <span id="s98">So that’s why I’m sa -- once -- th-that’s why I said initially, my problem was that I always had to be on such good behavior, because of him.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: How would you describe yourself?</span> <span id="s100">Were you an independent child?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: I think the word brat would probably come to mind.</span> <span id="s102">Independent.</span> <span id="s103">Well, I -- I think the one thing I -- that I learned and that I love, and I think that made it much easier to cope with me is I loved to read.</span> <span id="s104">And once I discovered books, I think I was easier to cope with.</span> <span id="s105">Before that, I -- I didn’t understand what I did that made it -- made me always get into trouble, but I did, you know.</span> <span id="s106">And my mother would say, Margit, please stand up, Margit, please sit still.</span> <span id="s107">You know, the usual things, you know, that children do.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: Were your parents Zionists?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: My father I am su -- I didn’t understand what Zionism was, but certainly he believed in the state of i -- of i -- not -- at-at -- Palestine, absolutely, because I heard him talk about that.</span> <span id="s110">They were firm believers that Jews had to have a place to go.</span> <span id="s111">And he was very, very much aware of what was happening in Germany, because he told my -- my mother’s brothers both to get out, and they listened to him.</span> <span id="s112">He could not leave, they would not let him.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: We’ll talk about that also in a little while --</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: Yes, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: I just wanted to go more into your own personal life.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: Mm-hm, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: You said you liked to read, any other hobbies that you had?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: Now?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: N-No, when you were a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: Oh.</span> <span id="s121">I read, I played.</span> <span id="s122">But I would think that reading was my great passion, always and still is.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: What about sports?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: I wasn’t very good.</span> <span id="s125">I mean, let me put it to you this way, when they would choose people to play, after everybody else was chosen they’d say, well, we’ll take her, you know?</span> <span id="s126">That was the final choice, nobody really wanted me.</span> <span id="s127">But I -- it didn’t bother me because I-I loved it, even though I was so bad at it.</span> <span id="s128">I mean, I played badly, but I loved doing it and I was always thrilled when they even would include me.</span> <span id="s129">So that was -- sports was not my forte, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: Did you have a special relationship with your twin brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: Y-Y -- no.</span> <span id="s132">Yes and no, we fought a lot.</span> <span id="s133">Oh, I did te -- take violin and all that stuff.</span> <span id="s134">You know that my father was very musical and had a wonderful voice and he played like umpteen instruments, well.</span> <span id="s135">So I learned how to play the violin badly, because I really wanted to play the piano, but my brother got the piano, per usual, he got everything, you know -- know the old ch -- my brother was a -- is and was a very gentle, sweet boy.</span> <span id="s136">I was really the monster.</span> <span id="s137">I mean, h-he -- it wa -- it -- definitely role reversal there somewhere, you know.</span> <span id="s138">But yeah, we got along fairly well.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: What kind of school did you go to?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: Well, in the beginning we went to a public school -- I mean, public -- sort of private public school, like they have in Europe.</span> <span id="s141">It wasn't a school like they have here, it was a small school.</span> <span id="s142">But then eventually, when things were very bad, we had a tutor that came from another town and taught all the Jewish children in -- in -- in -- in -- in Speyer.</span> <span id="s143">He came every -- every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: When you were very young --</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: -- did you feel very German?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: I never thought about it, I was German, that was it.</span> <span id="s148">I was a German and a Jew and the two were not mutually exclusive, you know, there was one or the o -- I wou -- if you’re saying did I feel a great sense of patriotism about Germany?</span> <span id="s149">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s150">I don’t think any child really thinks of it, unless -- I mean, today, after September the 11th, I’m sure there are children who will say, I’m an American and -- and be very conscious, who were unconscious before.</span> <span id="s151">I think it takes a catastrophic event to make a child realize it.</span> <span id="s152">I became very conscious of being a Jew, and not being accepted as a German, after awhile.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s154">Did you have any non-Jewish friends --</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: -- er -- early on?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: Oh yes, I had always Christian friends.</span> <span id="s158">As a matter of fact, I got a letter not too long ago from one of them, and I should -- I se -- I’ll send you -- and she goes to my sister’s grave and she makes sure that it’s still taken care of.</span> <span id="s159">So I mean, she -- yeah, I did, and I loved them.</span> <span id="s160">And they still played with me.</span> <span id="s161">I mean, some of -- some -- I mean, my mother, for example, sent me to a convent to learn how to knit and embroider because she and her -- my grandmother threw up their hands, they couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s162">And they sent me to the nuns, and I learned how to knit and I learned how to embroider.</span> <span id="s163">I had a nun there who would sit there and tell me wonderful stories.</span> <span id="s164">And it was fine.</span> <span id="s165">I was a Jewish child.</span> <span id="s166">I was the child of a -- a -- Dr. Greenberg and nobody ever thought about it.</span> <span id="s167">I also had a laundress who came -- we had a laundress who brought laundry back -- back and forth every week.</span> <span id="s168">I went to her house, I had ham sandwiches, and I -- my father found out, he was a little excited, but I was never very good.</span> <span id="s169">So, I mean I -- those are the kind of things you said how I got in trouble.</span> <span id="s170">I knew I shouldn’t during Passover eat bread, let alone cold cuts.</span> <span id="s171">So I mean, that’s the kind of troubles I was always in.</span> <span id="s172">But it was, as I said, fine.</span> <span id="s173">I mean, I loved it.</span> <span id="s174">I would go with my -- I would go to the nuns and they would teach me.</span> <span id="s175">So there was a lot of interaction between a non-Jewish community and our family.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: And favorite holidays that you remember?</span> <span id="s177">Anything that stays out in your mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: Yes, yes, I remembered -- I always liked the holidays, I did not like Passover, ever.</span> <span id="s179">I hated the Seder, I thought it was endless.</span> <span id="s180">I wanted to eat.</span> <span id="s181">But I liked Rosh Hashanah, I loved Yom Kippur, because I was allowed to eat lunch, and then I loved breaking fast, because they used to make something called Pergelfleisch.</span> <span id="s182">I don’t know if you know what that is.</span> <span id="s183">It’s -- it sounds horrific, it’s called pickled beef, but it is the most wonderful thing in the world, nobody’s ever makes it, nobody knows how to make it in this country.</span> <span id="s184">And I looked forward to that and having bread and I like the -- I like Saturday night dinners, except Swiss cheese.</span> <span id="s185">My father once said to me why -- why do you -- Margit, why do you hate Swiss?</span> <span id="s186">He s -- I said, I only like the holes.</span> <span id="s187">Now those are the kind of things that did not endear me to my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: What language did you speak at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: German.</span> <span id="s190">A little French, but mostly German.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: And why French?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: Because my mother liked it.</span> <span id="s193">But I mean, we’re talking about phrases like n’est-ce pas, or you know, comme il faut, or something like that.</span> <span id="s194">We’re not speaking -- I me -- I mean, I’m not talking about real, real conversational French.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: Well now let’s begin -- when did you first hear of a man named Hitler?</span> <span id="s196">I mean, you were born in 1929, so when did you first hear --</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: I think when I was five -- five, six years old.</span> <span id="s198">It’s when -- when I first saw the uniforms and I saw marching through the streets, and then --</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: What -- what do these uniforms mean to a five year old?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: Th-The reaction of the adults to them.</span> <span id="s201">I -- I think I became more nervous about them because of the reaction of the adults.</span> <span id="s202">The fact that suddenly there was a difference, there was more tension.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: Did your parents explain what this meant?</span> <span id="s204">Earl -- we’re talking about early on.</span> <span id="s205">Did your parents say anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: No, no they didn’t.</span> <span id="s207">All I know is that, for an example I was walking down the street one day when I was about maybe seven.</span> <span id="s208">I think it was -- began really when I was seven, and they were throwing stones at my brother and I, and they were yelling dirty Jew and -- and he -- he was hurt, I mean, they hit him.</span> <span id="s209">And when he -- we came home, that’s when my father and my mother said we couldn’t play any more and we couldn’t go to the school any more.</span> <span id="s210">So I was about seven or eight when it really, really, really began.</span> <span id="s211">And the German soldiers themselves began to change.</span> <span id="s212">Their attitude became -- there was so much hostility now.</span> <span id="s213">There was a different, there was a -- a break, and there was fear.</span> <span id="s214">Kristallnacht was when I was nine years old already.</span> <span id="s215">It had begun way before then.</span> <span id="s216">Not as terrible as it was after Kristallnacht, but there was a change.</span> <span id="s217">There was no longer the comfort level.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: What happened in school?</span> <span id="s219">Was this -- was your school a Jewish school, or both Jewish and non-Jewish students and faculty?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: They were -- it was a non-Jewish school, and they were non-Jewish teachers, and they did begin to express a difference.</span> <span id="s221">I-I think there was begin -- the beginning wa -- who -- whichever one of them was a -- an anti-Semitism, now felt free to express it, whereas before they might not have.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: This is preceding Kristallnacht, we’re talking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: Oh yeah, yeah, I -- it was, but again, it was much worse after Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s224">After Kristallnacht it became flagrant.</span> <span id="s225">And then -- let me say that at the time, you a -- also -- after -- even after Kristallnacht, there were still people who did not, in any way, react to us in a negative way, who became overtly anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s226">The people who were really anti-Semitic were always anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s227">Now the children were the surprise.</span> <span id="s228">The children who became so -- who became, you know, really taunted us and began -- made life so difficult for us.</span> <span id="s229">Those are the ones -- the mu -- most of the u -- most of the Christians ignored it, ignored us.</span> <span id="s230">They might not have been friendly, but they were not overtly -- they were not overtly cruel or anything.</span> <span id="s231">It was the children more than anything else, and some of the teachers.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: When you and your brother were walking down the street, you said in some [indecipherable] can you describe that in more detail what your -- what thoughts were going through your head as a young child, when that was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: When I was walking -- I walked with my brother and they began taunting us both.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: What kind of things were said, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: You dirty Jew, Christ killer.</span> <span id="s236">That was a big one.</span> <span id="s237">All -- get out ,we don’t want you, you don’t belong here, all the usual.</span> <span id="s238">And then they picked up stones and it became physical.</span> <span id="s239">They hit me, and I ran.</span> <span id="s240">I think they may -- I may have fallen and scraped my knee.</span> <span id="s241">They hit my brother and of course, you know, he bled.</span> <span id="s242">And after that we were not allowed to go to school any more, my mother said no, we were not going to go.</span> <span id="s243">And we never went anywhere -- anywhere without having somebody along, or traveling in -- more than two.</span> <span id="s244">It was a terrible thing.</span> <span id="s245">I think it traumatized my brother to the point that even today he doesn’t even talk about it, let alone remember it.</span> <span id="s246">It was a terrible --</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: When -- when did this happen?</span> <span id="s248">Was it before Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: Yeah, it happened before Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s250">Maybe -- I’m trying to think, was it before?</span> <span id="s251">No, I think it happened after.</span> <span id="s252">There were things that were happening before, but after Kristallnacht it all came together.</span> <span id="s253">It became a -- it became now a government directed persecution and I think it became -- and -- and -- and now the rhetoric was geared up so high.</span> <span id="s254">I mean, you know, we -- we -- the -- the -- the -- the -- the vendetta against Jew -- Jews, and the fine -- resolution became now a par -- a -- a -- a -- an aim, a political aim.</span> <span id="s255">And it became -- and I think -- you give people enough propaganda and you tell them and you repeat something enough, even they wa -- they want to believe it.</span> <span id="s256">If they have any dis -- I mean, today in this country, if you have a minority that somebody dislikes, if you give them enough power and justification to react to that minority, they will do it.</span> <span id="s257">And Hitler gave people the right to do it.</span> <span id="s258">He gave those children the right to hurt us.</span> <span id="s259">And he gave those people the right to burn down the synagogues and to arrest people and to murder them, and let the oth -- and let -- and let them -- and let the -- the people stand by passively and allow it to happen, because he made them feel that this was okay, that they -- he was absolutely getting rid of an -- of a world evil.</span> <span id="s260">That he was destroying a hydra-headed monster called a Jew.</span> <span id="s261">So it -- that was permissible.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: What does a flag with a swastika or a German in a uniform mean to a seven year old little girl?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: Oh, a -- it frightened me.</span> <span id="s264">I remember I used to walk very quickly with my head down if I saw them.</span> <span id="s265">They would stand, you know, at kiosks and if I saw one of them, and the sad thing, the sad thing that I did not forgive myself for for a long, long time was that I was so intimidated by them and wanted so much to belong and be part of that -- this -- this -- this life, these children that had -- were so rejecting to me -- you know, were rejecting me.</span> <span id="s266">And I saw them with their little uniforms and I wanted so much that I actually one day walked by a German soldier and the child ahead of me had given the heil Hitler sign, and I raised my hand and said heil Hitler.</span> <span id="s267">Even though I know this m -- I knew by then that this man was our sworn enemy.</span> <span id="s268">I mean, they had arrested my father already, and -- by then.</span> <span id="s269">And I knew.</span> <span id="s270">And I remember he turned around and he said to me, you’re a Jew, which humiliated me even more.</span> <span id="s271">Now, it took me years, I couldn’t think about it.</span> <span id="s272">When I would think about it I would like break out in sweat, I was so humiliated and embarrassed and angry that I -- but I was -- I forgave myself after awhile.</span> <span id="s273">I realized I was a child, I wanted to belong, I wanted to be part, and I wasn’t any more.</span> <span id="s274">I was now ostracized.</span> <span id="s275">All -- we all were.</span> <span id="s276">All our friends were.</span> <span id="s277">We were now persona non grata.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: And again, did you talk this over with your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: Oh yes, we talked --</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: And how did they handle it?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: They themselves didn’t know how -- what to do.</span> <span id="s282">My father only knew one thing, that we had to leave, that it was done, that we had to go.</span> <span id="s283">That -- but he couldn’t, he could not get out.</span> <span id="s284">They -- he was refused the visas, he was considered a political prisoner and he couldn -- but he knew.</span> <span id="s285">I mean, he urged my cousins, he urged my uncles, he urged everybody to go, they all left.</span> <span id="s286">They all went.</span> <span id="s287">They went.</span> <span id="s288">He knew that there was no survival.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: Whe-When did he try to start leaving?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: He left -- immediately after he came back from Dachau, when they had arrested him aft -- at Kristallnacht they arrested him.</span> <span id="s291">He came back six weeks later, he did everything in his power -- I think he had done it before, but not with the kind of urgency that he felt then.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: Prec-Preceding November ’38, was his work at the nu -- at the synagogue affected at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: No, that continued.</span> <span id="s294">And I’ll tell you something else that was interesting.</span> <span id="s295">One of the priests tried to -- wa -- on -- during Kristallnacht woke him up to tell him the synagogue was burning, they ran down and saved the Torah.</span> <span id="s296">I mean, you know ya -- I mean, the -- i-in all -- in the midst of absolute evil -- and I use that word in its true sense, there are people who took an interest.</span> <span id="s297">I remember walking with my mother while my father was in the -- in Dachau and I met one of my nuns.</span> <span id="s298">I had -- was no longer going there, you know, because I think it was difficult for them, they couldn’t -- I mean, anybody who had anything to do with a Jew was at risk.</span> <span id="s299">So I remember she bent down, she kissed me, and I had this overwhelming feeling of sadness, because sh-she ha -- the tear rolled down her cheek.</span> <span id="s300">So I mean she -- they all -- we all knew, I mean everybody knew that we were condemned.</span> <span id="s301">Nobody knew about the concentration camps yet.</span> <span id="s302">My father knew Dachau existed and Buchenwald existed, but nobody understood what the ultimate plan was.</span> <span id="s303">I mean, nobody could -- would have believed it, except that my father knew that the ultimate plan was to kill everybody, and he wanted his family out.</span> <span id="s304">Now, I think my mother -- and this is something I’m not sure about, but I do believe from what I remember as a child, that my mother could have left, and she refused.</span> <span id="s305">She stayed with my father.</span> <span id="s306">So I -- you know, I think she could have gone with her brothers, because they were leaving, and my grandmother could have gone too, and they chose not to go, they chose to stay.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: Could she have taken you too, the two of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: Probably.</span> <span id="s309">But for some reason she wanted -- she didn’t do it.</span> <span id="s310">She didn’t.</span> <span id="s311">She condemned herself, effectively, to death, and probably us too, although I don’t think she really believed they would kill us.</span> <span id="s312">I don’t think any mother believes that her children are going to be killed.</span> <span id="s313">But I think she could have gone.</span> <span id="s314">And that -- for knowing my mother as I know her, it -- as I remember her, it -- it -- she was such a delicate, as I said, nervous woman, for her to have made that decision had to take enormous courage.</span> <span id="s315">I mean, for her to know that she was going to stay in this horrible place where, you know, when everybody else was starting to go, you know, I think it had to take enormous strength.</span> <span id="s316">I don’t know if I could have done it.</span> <span id="s317">I don’t know if I wouldn’t have said, I -- I’m sorry, I -- I’m taking my children, I’m running.</span> <span id="s318">I think it takes a very strange love, belief, confidence in your mate, or not being willing to leave him, you know, to -- to face it by himself.</span> <span id="s319">I -- I -- he -- she did that.</span> <span id="s320">I think that -- that -- that’s one of the remarkable things about her.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Margitta Cooper.</span> <span id="s323">This is tape number one, side B. Let’s now talk about Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s324">What are your memories of that specific time?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: I think it was probably one of the major traumas in my life.</span> <span id="s326">First of all there was the burning of the synagogue, which while I -- I must say, being a little brat, as I said, or a child, for one glorious moment I said, oh thank God, I don’t have to go.</span> <span id="s327">But then I -- then even -- e-even I understood that this was not a good thing.</span> <span id="s328">But then they came to arrest my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: Wer-Were you awake at night?</span> <span id="s330">Whe-When did you first become aware what was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: I heard the banging on the doors, and I heard them -- my father going downstairs and we -- the maid and my mother and I heard -- I knew it was the priest.</span> <span id="s332">And my father ran out of the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: This is in the middle of the night?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s335">And then when he came back at five o’clock that morning, I heard again, a lot of noise, and I ran downstairs and I -- I mean, I don’t think they had gone to sleep, I mean, nobody did.</span> <span id="s336">I mean, my father was still dressed, and he had burned his hand, and I think he had -- was wearing like a bandage on it.</span> <span id="s337">And the SS had come in and they were arresting him.</span> <span id="s338">And my mother -- this is -- and my mother was hysterical, everybody was hysterical and I started to become hysterical because I didn’t understand.</span> <span id="s339">I must say the SS again, this is the contradiction in human beings, when they saw me and my brother, they tried to reassure me.</span> <span id="s340">They said, it’ll be all right, your father will be all right.</span> <span id="s341">And of course they were very polite.</span> <span id="s342">I mean, there was nothing of the sturm and drung kind of thing that you see in the movies.</span> <span id="s343">They were very calm, very icy, very -- you know, waited for him to get hi -- you know, put his coat on and everything, and he was arrested.</span> <span id="s344">Now, once that happened my mother did everything to get him out, once we found out where he was, how -- the police kind of told her where he was, or somebody told her.</span> <span id="s345">My grandmother and my uncle all tried everything.</span> <span id="s346">And I’ll tell you a story that sounds like something out of a movie.</span> <span id="s347">My mother took -- told me to get dressed one afternoon, and I -- were t -- I-I was dressed, and she took me by the hand, and she had her pocketbook, and in her -- and er -- and she was holding a little chamois bag.</span> <span id="s348">And I’ll never forget the -- and I remembered what she wore.</span> <span id="s349">She wore a -- she had a magnificent blue coat with a blue fox collar and she wore that coat with a matching blue dress.</span> <span id="s350">And we went to the police, and we sat outside and waited, and I had no idea and for once I was very quiet.</span> <span id="s351">And then she -- they told her to come in and we sat in front of this man and he wore a black uniform with the SS -- I mean, the swastika on his arm.</span> <span id="s352">And my mother said to -- they were talking and then she opened this little bag and she too -- put all her jewelry on the desk and she said, you may have it all.</span> <span id="s353">She said, I would like you to have it, she says, if you can get me -- if my husband come home.</span> <span id="s354">And I’ll never forget what this man said, he looked at -- my mother was a very pretty woman, and he too-took her -- the jewelry and he put it back in the bag and he handed it to her -- of course it was all gone eventually anyway.</span> <span id="s355">And he says, I cannot take it, he says, but I will -- and I ca -- he says, I will try to do what I can.</span> <span id="s356">So we went home, and about three days later I heard footsteps coming down the street toward our house, I knew it was my father.</span> <span id="s357">I knew it.</span> <span id="s358">I woke up the whole household.</span> <span id="s359">I start screaming, I said, Papa’s home, Papi’s home.</span> <span id="s360">And everybody says no, no, no.</span> <span id="s361">My mother says, what?</span> <span id="s362">I said, he’s coming.</span> <span id="s363">And sure enough, the door rang -- there was a knock on the door, we all flew, and there was my father.</span> <span id="s364">He had taken -- he -- as he left the camp, he had given his jacket, his overcoat, everything he had to the prisoners that were left, that would never come home.</span> <span id="s365">And he had a white -- he wore his white shirt, he was very thin.</span> <span id="s366">My -- my -- my mother, of course, wept.</span> <span id="s367">We put him into -- he went to bed and I remember during the morning -- this was very early in the morning, was maybe 5:30 - six o’clock in the morning -- everything in Germany happens either in the middle of the night or early in the morning.</span> <span id="s368">That seemed to be their best time, you know, like the vampires, you know, do well at night.</span> <span id="s369">Anyway, I remember tiptoeing into his room to make sure that he was there, you know?</span> <span id="s370">And I remember he looked at me, he says, Margit?</span> <span id="s371">And I said yes.</span> <span id="s372">I said, are you all right?</span> <span id="s373">He says yes.</span> <span id="s374">Of course he wasn’t, because he knew.</span> <span id="s375">You see, my father then knew that ultimately it was all downhill from then.</span> <span id="s376">I mean, you know, the school, everything had stopped, the tutors came.</span> <span id="s377">They were -- the families were trying to get out.</span> <span id="s378">Of course, the families that ended up going to Gerthe with us, stayed.</span> <span id="s379">They did not get out.</span> <span id="s380">And I still -- of course, and there were still a lot of people who really believed that this was some kind of nightmare, that something was going to happen.</span> <span id="s381">But then the united -- I mean, England went to war.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: How lo -- how long was your father in Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: Six weeks.</span> <span id="s384">They kept him from Kristallnacht out and he came home in the beginning of January.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: Did he tell you anything about what happened while he was there?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: He said it was very bad.</span> <span id="s387">He says there were a lot of people there.</span> <span id="s388">He said there were a lot of young men there.</span> <span id="s389">And he also said that that time that they were not getting out, that these were people that -- I don’t think they had gas chambers then, but these were really prisoners -- not all Jews.</span> <span id="s390">I don’t think they were all Jews.</span> <span id="s391">But he said the conditions were horrific.</span> <span id="s392">There was hunger.</span> <span id="s393">Of course he was so thin when he came home.</span> <span id="s394">There was already hunger, there was already a lack of food, there was lack of warmth, it was very, very cold.</span> <span id="s395">That’s why he left all his clothing, as much as he could.</span> <span id="s396">The conditions were very bad and obviously he knew, he sensed that they were gearing up for something very big.</span> <span id="s397">And he also found out that Dachau was just one camp.</span> <span id="s398">There was also Buchenwald then.</span> <span id="s399">And he was -- Belsen-Belsen wasn’t there yet.</span> <span id="s400">But he was -- he knew.</span> <span id="s401">He had heard from what -- he -- he told my uncle, who had come to visit him right before he left -- he left for -- for -- for the United States.</span> <span id="s402">That’s why I know that my mother could have probably gone because my uncle came from Berlin to see his sister.</span> <span id="s403">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: But what did you do when your father was away?</span> <span id="s405">What activity, did -- were you still in school or had -- had you been expelled from school?</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: My mother slept with us that night.</span> <span id="s407">I didn’t -- oh, I forgot to tell you that.</span> <span id="s408">The night that my father was arrested, that day my mother was so panicked that she packed us up and took us to cousins in Mannheim.</span> <span id="s409">She thought that -- she -- she -- she just was so frightened and probably went there to figure out what they could do for -- for my father.</span> <span id="s410">We stayed there, I’d say almost a week.</span> <span id="s411">And I remember I cried that night, I got like hysterical, I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s412">I don’t know if it was a performance, that I was being Sarah Bernhardt, or what, but I -- I -- I -- you know, and we stayed for a week and then came home and I think that’s when she -- dis -- di -- I think that’s when already they had begun to try to get to release him.</span> <span id="s413">The tutor came, I still played with my friends, my little Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s414">I didn’t -- I don’t think any Christian child was allowed to play with a Jew any more at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: When had you started with a tutor?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: As soon as we had to leave school, all the children, all the Jewish children got tutors to co -- got one tutor and we were taught in a little room someplace.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: When -- when did you have to leave school, do you remember?</span> <span id="s418">A: Yes, after Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s419">Oh, maybe -- I think after Kristallnacht, yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s420">I think it was then, and I think it was very uncomfortable before then, too.</span> <span id="s421">You know, there was a lot of anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s422">And as I said, the teachers who really didn’t like Jews were free to begin to react to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: W-Were you physically hurt in school at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: No.</span> <span id="s425">No, no.</span> <span id="s426">No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: What -- what kind of things did the teachers say to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: Well, she would -- you know, she -- it -- it wasn’t anything overt.</span> <span id="s429">It was, your people, or -- you know, th-the -- the usual things, you know.</span> <span id="s430">Y-You know, you all think you know everything, or something, you know, there -- wa -- there were little slurs, which they could get away with.</span> <span id="s431">I think after Kristallnacht they could have probably been much more overt.</span> <span id="s432">But by then aw -- there was no child that was going.</span> <span id="s433">I mean, we couldn't walk the streets, we were afraid.</span> <span id="s434">Our parents were afraid.</span> <span id="s435">So it had become an absolutely impossibility for a child to continue in public school.</span> <span id="s436">And it -- it -- it was dangerous.</span> <span id="s437">So my brother and I and my friend Truda Alcon, who now lives in New York and Gunter Katzen, all of us had this crazy man who came, poor soul, he came from Ludwigshaven every morning and went back.</span> <span id="s438">He was a bad teacher, too, very boring.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: Wa-Was there secular subjects and religious, or just --</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: Secular.</span> <span id="s441">My father taught religion, you know, whatever religion I have -- had.</span> <span id="s442">I wa -- I became, of course, an agnostic by the time I could think straight.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: Do you remember names having to be added on, Sarah and Israel to the par -- adult names?</span> <span id="s444">Does that --</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: No, no, I don’t remember that at all, no.</span> <span id="s446">No, they -- you mean i -- i -- to identify us?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: No, I don’t remember that.</span> <span id="s449">I don’t think so, no.</span> <span id="s450">The only thing was that -- things settled actually into a routine.</span> <span id="s451">That is why the arrest in 1940, to go to Gurs was such a profound shock, because life had become a routine, like everything else.</span> <span id="s452">I didn't think -- nobody thought about being re-arrested again.</span> <span id="s453">I mean, my father, I think suspected and maybe my mother, but I as a child thought everything was over.</span> <span id="s454">So when they came that night, I had no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: Preceding Kristallnacht, Hitler had marched into Austria --</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s457">Yeah -- oh, we --</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: -- did you, as a child, know about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: Oh, we all knew.</span> <span id="s460">My fa -- there was a -- my parents were very political and their friends were political, so I knew about the anschluss and I knew about --</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: And again, what does that mean to you as a child, a nine year old?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: I wanted Hitler to die.</span> <span id="s463">I wanted Hitler -- I wanted the Jews -- I had these fantasies about these great Jewish generals riding, in their great armies, to defeat Hitler.</span> <span id="s464">I had visions of -- of God coming -- and I believed in God, of course -- I bel -- I thought that God would reach down his hand, the way he did it in the Bible and -- and -- and smite them, all the Germans, all the Nazis.</span> <span id="s465">That was my fantasy, and that’s what I -- well, I was always a dreamer and I visualized this, you know, these -- this great host suddenly coming and -- and -- and destroying the Germans.</span> <span id="s466">And that was wonderful and that’s why I knew that there was war.</span> <span id="s467">And when England would send her planes over at night, and my father and I would be outside watching the planes coming, while my par -- my mother and my brother and my grandmother were downstairs, my broth -- my father and I would go up to see.</span> <span id="s468">And the planes were coming, they were bombing Germany as early as 1939, most people don’t realize it, 1939 and ’40.</span> <span id="s469">I was thrilled.</span> <span id="s470">I loved it, I was excited that the Englanders were coming.</span> <span id="s471">The English were coming.</span> <span id="s472">Yes, I wanted Germany to be defeated.</span> <span id="s473">I knew that, you know, that I -- the Russians had -- I mean, I was horrified when I heard that the Russians were friends with the Germans because of the pact that Stalin had made.</span> <span id="s474">I mean, those were things that stunned me.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: Had you -- what did you know about the United States by that time, by ’38 - ’39 - ’40?</span> <span id="s476">What did the United States mean to you?</span> <span id="s477">What di -- what was the concept of the United States to a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: The United States of course was not called the United States, it was called America.</span> <span id="s479">America was the land, literally, of milk and honey.</span> <span id="s480">America was the Promised Land.</span> <span id="s481">America was the land that God chose for us to go to, if we were lucky.</span> <span id="s482">It was the place of miracles.</span> <span id="s483">It was utopia.</span> <span id="s484">It was everything that human beings could possibly visualize.</span> <span id="s485">The great hope was America, and that I understood.</span> <span id="s486">What it was, I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s487">I knew it was a country, but I had no idea -- it was something myth -- almost mystic.</span> <span id="s488">It -- I didn’t know, I just knew that I had to get to America, that in order to live, for us to be safe, we had to go to America.</span> <span id="s489">And that’s all I knew and that’s -- I heard that, of course, from adults.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: Did you ever listen to speeches of Hitler on the radio?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: No, well yeah, the raving and the ranting, but I didn’t fully understand, you know.</span> <span id="s492">But when you talk about America, I had read Lord Fauntleroy, who was born in Brooklyn, you see, so I had an idea of how wonderful America was, and I had read some books that -- that you know, I -- I had read a translation of some -- some books that had Americans in them.</span> <span id="s493">So I knew that this was the place, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: So life continu -- your father came back from Dachau, you had private tutoring, and life --</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: Mm-hm, he conducted services.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: He continued conducting services.</span> <span id="s498">Everything was going all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: What -- what happened to the rabbi of the synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: Well, he was not there that much.</span> <span id="s501">My father usually conducted th-the -- the services there.</span> <span id="s502">He a --</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: What was the rabbi’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: I don’t even remember.</span> <span id="s505">I don’t remember, isn’t that sad?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: How much --</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: Lehrer -- was it Lehrer?</span> <span id="s508">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: Ho-How much destruction was there of your synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: Not that -- not that much, we -- it was able to be used.</span> <span id="s511">The only thing that was damaged, I think, was the -- in -- in the -- the sanctuary and I think that was repaired.</span> <span id="s512">I -- as I said, the life, oddly enough, continued after Kristallnacht, in a -- in a bizarre sort of a way.</span> <span id="s513">There was -- I -- I -- there was -- there was none of the -- I mean, we didn’t live in fear and trembling, at least I didn’t.</span> <span id="s514">What my parents or my father felt, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s515">I’m sure they -- they were much -- but I didn’t, I -- you know, children are very resilient.</span> <span id="s516">I accepted things had changed.</span> <span id="s517">I’m not going to public school, I have a tutor.</span> <span id="s518">I don’t go outside to play that much, that’s fine.</span> <span id="s519">I mean, I adapted and it became normal.</span> <span id="s520">What was -- what was abnormal now became normal.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: Did you confide in your brother at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: No.</span> <span id="s523">Mm-mm, we were -- very rarely talked about this.</span> <span id="s524">And then, you know, eventually it wasn’t normal any more.</span> <span id="s525">1940 arrived and the Nazis arrived and they arrested us again in the middle of the night, the Germans are night people.</span> <span id="s526">And they came and said pack up, and that was it, I mean, that was the end.</span> <span id="s527">And we left our house for good.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: Ta-Talk a little bit about that experience, when you -- were -- you were fast asleep?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: I was fast asleep, again there was a banging on the door and the soldiers came in.</span> <span id="s530">Not Nazis, soldiers.</span> <span id="s531">They told us we had two and a half hours to pack everything we need.</span> <span id="s532">My mother forgot my clothes, most of them, so that was very tough for me in Gurs.</span> <span id="s533">I mean, you know, kind of had to wear a very few things.</span> <span id="s534">She na -- she was very upset that she forgot.</span> <span id="s535">But anyway -- but I would have outgrown them anyway.</span> <span id="s536">Anyway, she -- we had two and a half hours.</span> <span id="s537">My father wept.</span> <span id="s538">That’s the only time I can ever remember my father, because my father knew that this was it.</span> <span id="s539">Of course, his horror was that we were going to go to Buchen -- he did not know about Gurs in France.</span> <span id="s540">He thought we were going either to Dachau or Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s541">So we packed that night, they came in trucks and took us.</span> <span id="s542">There were lots of people on the trucks.</span> <span id="s543">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: Wa-Was this the four of you, or more of your extended family?</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: It was my -- the four of us and my grandmother, who died in Gurs.</span> <span id="s546">My mother’s mother.</span> <span id="s547">The five of us went into the trucks where there were already other people and they took us to a train station and then to Frankfurt.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: How old were your parents?</span> <span id="s549">Were they in their what, late 30’s, early 40’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: 40’s, in their 40’s, cause my sister had been 10, so my mother was in her early 30’s, she must have been then in her very early 40’s, yeah.</span> <span id="s551">And so was my father, though my father must have been older, in his -- maybe in his middle 40’s.</span> <span id="s552">Anyway, we went to Frankfurt.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: Tell me about getting on the truck.</span> <span id="s554">What were people saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: Silent.</span> <span id="s556">There was dead silence.</span> <span id="s557">It was very quiet.</span> <span id="s558">I mean, we just sat there and I think some people wanted to know where we were going, and what was happening.</span> <span id="s559">And the thing that my mother was very upset about, cause there was laundry in the laundry, in the -- in the washing machine.</span> <span id="s560">I mean, those are the little things that are absolutely heartbreaking when you think that a woman was riding to eventual death.</span> <span id="s561">And what was she worried about?</span> <span id="s562">That somebody would find out she had laundry left in the washing machine.</span> <span id="s563">That’s what enrages me so.</span> <span id="s564">That’s when I feel total rage, at that -- those little minutiae, you know, those little -- little things.</span> <span id="s565">Anyway, it was quiet.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: Did you take anything special as a child?</span> <span id="s567">A toy or a book or anything that meant something to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: I took my books.</span> <span id="s569">That’s unfortunate because I didn’t have any clothes, but I took books.</span> <span id="s570">I took Tarzan, I took the kinderha -- hagen, th-the -- that -- that -- that the -- that’s a special series of little books that will -- for a -- she -- it was called kinderhagen.</span> <span id="s571">And that means the little nestling, you know, the little bird?</span> <span id="s572">That’s what it is, like a child, you know.</span> <span id="s573">And I took some books.</span> <span id="s574">We -- it was chilly.</span> <span id="s575">We got to Frankfurt, they gave us wonderful sandwiches, and which were -- which were not kosher but my father said I could eat them.</span> <span id="s576">I thought they were great.</span> <span id="s577">I said oh, this is going to be wonderful.</span> <span id="s578">Then we got on the train.</span> <span id="s579">Huge train that stretched for as far as you could see.</span> <span id="s580">And we all got on there, everybody that was -- had been unloaded from the trucks got on this train.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: So the truck went directly to the train station.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: Right, station, right.</span> <span id="s583">The train curved around the entire track, that’s how long it was, and we all got on there, and that m -- at that moment, my grandmother, I think had what is known to -- would have been called a TIA, a transient ischemic attack.</span> <span id="s584">She did not know where she was and she was disoriented and confused and of course terrified.</span> <span id="s585">And -- but she was okay after that.</span> <span id="s586">We got on the train and the train began -- and -- and they were slamming the doors shut and --</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: This is a passenger train, with seats?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: This was not a cattle train.</span> <span id="s589">And they were slamming, and the train began to move and then it stopped, about an hour later and said, anyone who has jewelry, give it up now, a -- or you will be severely punished.</span> <span id="s590">Now, there are people who -- my mother didn’t have any, and if sh -- I mean, she had given her -- ma -- jewelry that belonged to her to my uncle to take to the United States and I got that eventually, but just a few pieces.</span> <span id="s591">Most of it she had already sold.</span> <span id="s592">I think probably to bribe -- bribe -- for bribery to get my father out, which was fine.</span> <span id="s593">Whatever money they -- she had.</span> <span id="s594">And there were people who did hand it over and there are other pe-people I don’t think ever did, and I hope they didn’t.</span> <span id="s595">It didn’t matter, they were going to die anyway.</span> <span id="s596">So anyway, the train then went, continued and continued and -- for hours.</span> <span id="s597">I mean, don’t forget, we were leaving Frankfurt and going to the Pyrenees, which is -- and you know, so it was overnight.</span> <span id="s598">And then we got to this place, and there were more trucks.</span> <span id="s599">And they unloaded the train, this enormous train of people --</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: Were there many children with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s602">Well, the families, yeah, they had a lot of children, which is an interesting story.</span> <span id="s603">When we got to Gurs, I am not -- I’m very vague how we got there.</span> <span id="s604">I think it was also by bus, but we got to this place which was a sea of mud with barracks.</span> <span id="s605">They separated the men and the women.</span> <span id="s606">The women had the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q: O-On the -- on the trip to Gurs --</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: -- you said there were many children.</span> <span id="s610">Were the children calm?</span> <span id="s611">What did -- did the parents say to them?</span> <span id="s612">What did your parents say to you o-on the journey to Gurs?</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: My -- I -- I asked wher-where we were going, and I go -- I have to tell you, my parents were very -- always very truthful.</span> <span id="s614">My father said he did not know and so did my mother.</span> <span id="s615">But my father also said we are together.</span> <span id="s616">And -- and that was -- I think reassuring.</span> <span id="s617">I was not afraid.</span> <span id="s618">Now, I think maybe -- I’m not sure, in retrospect, whether the reason I wasn’t afraid is because even though I always thought through these last four -- three or four years that it had no affect, it did affect me and that I had become very -- not stoic, maybe but dis -- disaffected, or disas -- you know, and no longer associative with a -- you know, a -- a -- a -- lacking affect, in other words.</span> <span id="s619">That maybe in some way I had detached myself, so that I was really looking at it now from -- from -- from a perspective that had nothing to do with me.</span> <span id="s620">I was there.</span> <span id="s621">So maybe that’s really more the truth than anything else.</span> <span id="s622">At any rate, I was not afraid.</span> <span id="s623">I didn’t know, and I wasn’t afraid of death, and I certainly never thought of anybody harming me.</span> <span id="s624">When we got to Gurs and I saw the sea of mud, I knew.</span> <span id="s625">The women, once they were separated from their men, fell apart.</span> <span id="s626">And this little dictator, meaning me, and all the other children -- oh, the German soldiers then said, get the women organized.</span> <span id="s627">To us.</span> <span id="s628">To us children.</span> <span id="s629">So that we were marching up and down these long barracks where these women were huddled, didn’t know what -- I said, get yourselves organized.</span> <span id="s630">I said to my mother, sit there with Omar.</span> <span id="s631">And my mother, who would have probably had a shrieking fit having been told by her 10 year old daughter how to behave, right, did exactly what we told -- and we were so drunk with power, these kids, we were like, you know “Lord of the Flies”?</span> <span id="s632">I mean, we were telling everybody what to do.</span> <span id="s633">There was no place to lie down, there was no place to do anything, I mean, it was barracks.</span> <span id="s634">Long barracks with nothing.</span> <span id="s635">Eventually they gave us these pallets, you know, to lie -- sit on, to lie on, but there was nothing then.</span> <span id="s636">And then they did come with the pallets and they handed them out.</span> <span id="s637">And every family, every mother and her child had like a little -- ha-have you been to -- in barracks?</span> <span id="s638">You know, you can put stuff under the little eaves, you know?</span> <span id="s639">Well, that’s where they put their possessions and that’s where we were, it was very cold, damp, and very muddy.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: You’re talking April 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s642">And a sea of mud.</span> <span id="s643">I mean, that’s the one thing I remember about -- no, this was in October of 19 -- was it --</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: Oh, I’m sorry, October 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s646">This was a sea of mud.</span> <span id="s647">I mean, you could not step anywhere.</span> <span id="s648">And the -- and the -- and of course the mu -- the m -- wives were terrified, the mothers were terrified because they no longer were with their husbands.</span> <span id="s649">And they went out on their own wi -- among these strangers with these soldiers.</span> <span id="s650">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: Did you say goodbye to your father when you were separated?</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: Yeah, we said goodbye, and I knew he was going to be down the road from us.</span> <span id="s653">They did tell us that they, you know, the men were going to be in one section and the women were going to be in another section.</span> <span id="s654">But it -- but can you imagine leaving your home and suddenly being transported for 24 hours or whatever time it took, and i -- and then put into a strange place in a barracks?</span> <span id="s655">I mean, and having absolutely nobody to tell you anything, nobody to explain to you what was happening to you?</span> <span id="s656">I mean, f -- Americans -- I mean, I -- I sometimes think to myself, what would happen if tomorrow morning this happened in this country, people suddenly vanished?</span> <span id="s657">I mean, you no longer saw anybody that had lived in that house for umpteen years and was suddenly gone.</span> <span id="s658">So I mean, th -- it was a terrifying time for -- for -- for -- for these -- for these poor women and for the -- and the children were crying, a lot of the children were crying, they were afraid.</span> <span id="s659">Again, I wasn’t afraid.</span> <span id="s660">I -- I just a -- I -- you know, I just gave orders.</span> <span id="s661">And it worked.</span> <span id="s662">I -- in a strange way I guess the -- the -- the three or four of us who were running around being, you know, the administrators probably did a lot of good because it made some of the mother’s angry enough to say, who are you to tell us anything, and it probably established a sense of normalcy, you know?</span> <span id="s663">And that was the beginning of Gurs.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: And then what did you -- what -- what -- did they give you any food?</span> <span id="s665">Can you describe the living conditions there?</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: The food was horrific.</span> <span id="s667">They had a stove that really didn’t throw much heat.</span> <span id="s668">The food was really like very -- like thin gruel soups.</span> <span id="s669">They had a place that they had built o -- on -- like on -- on -- that you walked up, it was like on stilts, where they had running water and stuff and a toilet, and toilets.</span> <span id="s670">And where you could wash.</span> <span id="s671">The camp had originally been established for Spanish prisoners and had been emptied after the Spanish Civil War.</span> <span id="s672">So actually we were using that, those facilities and of course they were not great facilities.</span> <span id="s673">It was a -- I think there was a lot of ent -- diarrhea, I mean, all the unpleasant side effects of not having a -- a decent food and decent water and decent conditions and certainly very -- no medical care, very little medical care.</span> <span id="s674">There were deaths.</span> <span id="s675">A little child died while out there.</span> <span id="s676">My father was allowed to sort of wander around and sort of, you know, help, because he was, you know, a-as a -- sort of a religious leader, they allowed him certain privileges.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: Could he come over to your section?</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: He came to visit, oh yeah.</span> <span id="s679">And I went -- was able to see him.</span> <span id="s680">I wasn’t allowed to, but I’d sneak over there anyway.</span> <span id="s681">Yeah, he -- the men were allowed to visit.</span> <span id="s682">I mean, not conjugal visits, just to see their families.</span> <span id="s683">Yeah, I think maybe once a week or so, they came.</span> <span id="s684">My father came more frequently.</span> <span id="s685">He also was able to get me -- he was able to get my mother galoshes.</span> <span id="s686">The thing that was always -- you know, like little boots, because of -- and me, too.</span> <span id="s687">The thing I did learn, and I’ve never forgotten is if you need to flee anywhere, you better damn sight have money.</span> <span id="s688">You can’t stop at the ATM machine.</span> <span id="s689">You have to have cash on you, your life is always saved by money.</span> <span id="s690">Money is a most valuable commodity you can have, if you are stuck anywhere where -- you can always buy your way out.</span> <span id="s691">It’s sad to say, but that’s true.</span> <span id="s692">My father had some money with him, and it was a -- he was able to make things a little easier, than maybe families who fled and didn’t have any cash on them at all.</span> <span id="s693">That was the important thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: And that’s how he got you your galoshes.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: Got me my galoshes and maybe got my mother a blanket -- my grandmother and my mother a blanket.</span> <span id="s696">I mean, that’s -- that -- that -- that’s true.</span> <span id="s697">It -- it’s sad that you can’t -- that everything is available if you have the money.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: So the weather got worse, October, November, December.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q: What did you do to keep warm, and what did you do during the day?</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A: Well, in -- we -- we dressed as warm as we could, and I read.</span> <span id="s702">Thank God people always are wonderful, they bring books.</span> <span id="s703">And I -- we sort of circulated all the books and I reread them again.</span> <span id="s704">I mean, you know, there’s always people -- there are always people who have a sense of knowing that books are important.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum ca -- volunteer collection interview with Margitta Cooper.</span> <span id="s707">This is tape number two, side A and you were talking about your life in Gurs.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: The thing about Gurs was that -- the discomfort of -- for the -- more for the -- I think, for -- for -- for th -- for the women than for the children.</span> <span id="s709">Now, there’s certain things that I -- I found -- I -- I wasn’t bored.</span> <span id="s710">I just didn’t -- I -- I just -- my -- I had my girlfriend al -- Truda with me and we still played together and we play -- we were together.</span> <span id="s711">The thing that bothered me is for example, there was a young wo-woman in our -- in our barracks who was handicapped.</span> <span id="s712">She had a very severe defor -- severely deformed hand.</span> <span id="s713">And I’m not sure if -- if it -- if -- if -- what happened, but one d -- you know, she -- she was gone.</span> <span id="s714">I wo -- I came back one day and I -- you know, when you live in a place, even a child as insensitive as I may have been, you know -- you can sense atmospheres.</span> <span id="s715">I mean, there was -- even the im -- the -- even the abnormal atmosphere of being in these barracks became a normality after awhile, so when you walk in and you sense another change, you know something has happened, and I knew something had happened because I saw -- I did not see Becky.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: And how old was she?</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: She may have been 14.</span> <span id="s718">She was older than I was, 14 or 15, pretty child, pretty young girl, but she had a very badly deformed hand, like a thalidomide hand.</span> <span id="s719">And something was -- and I think -- and there was something wrong with the second hand too, but one was really -- and I remember I walked in and I sat down and I turned around and I said -- I looked around and I saw her mother was sitting like with her head bent down and not doing anything, and I said, where’s Becky?</span> <span id="s720">And my mother said shhh.</span> <span id="s721">And I said -- well, that was not the thing to say to me, so -- unfortunately, so I said, where is Becky?</span> <span id="s722">And she says, Margit, I’m going to hit you.</span> <span id="s723">Be still.</span> <span id="s724">Now that -- when that happened, I said, did she go away, and I said -- my mother said yes, she went away.</span> <span id="s725">And I was glad, I was happy, I thought she had gotten away.</span> <span id="s726">It took me -- yet, I knew.</span> <span id="s727">I wanted to believe she had gotten away, but I m -- sensed there was something wrong.</span> <span id="s728">And then there was the little girl, beautiful little girl who became ill, she was about maybe three years old, and she died.</span> <span id="s729">And I remember th -- the mother screaming in this makeshift hospital they had there, they had like a makeshift infirmary, that her body was still warm.</span> <span id="s730">She was screaming at my father, saying, she’s still warm.</span> <span id="s731">And I remember my mother was dissolved in sobs, I mean, she was hyster -- well, first of all, to see this mother lose her child, well it had to bring back that same trauma for her, plus the fact that there was nothing to be done.</span> <span id="s732">And I’m sure, under -- given circumstances, she would have survived.</span> <span id="s733">The thing was, eventually my father found out, or somehow discovered that he could get my brother and I out of Gurs.</span> <span id="s734">And I think that in every energy he had became bend toward that.</span> <span id="s735">And then of course they told him that he could -- his son could go.</span> <span id="s736">My brother, but not me.</span> <span id="s737">So my father told them -- and he told me this -- that he had two children, they were both going to leave, or neither will leave.</span> <span id="s738">He said, I’m not letting my son go and my daughter is to stay here.</span> <span id="s739">In other words he -- what he said to them in effect was, you’re not sending my child, one child to death and not the other.</span> <span id="s740">They bo -- he says, they’re twins.</span> <span id="s741">They belong together, they should go together.</span> <span id="s742">And they let us.</span> <span id="s743">So it was me and my brother.</span> <span id="s744">It was my friend Truda and my friend Gunter Katz, who were among the four children who left Gurs.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: Let’s talk a little bit about again y-your life at Gurs before we get onto the next stage.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: Mm.</span> <span id="s747">Mm-hm, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: What did you do during the day, and -- from October to April?</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: Truda and I would play cards, somebody had a deck of cards.</span> <span id="s750">We would read.</span> <span id="s751">We would talk.</span> <span id="s752">We would be outside in the mud, playing.</span> <span id="s753">I don’t remember what we played.</span> <span id="s754">We played games that children played.</span> <span id="s755">There were no -- I think somebody had a ball, we would play with a ball.</span> <span id="s756">We tried to play things that were normal.</span> <span id="s757">I would go visit my father as much as I could, my brother and I would.</span> <span id="s758">But Truda and I spent a lot of time together and we would be playing games.</span> <span id="s759">I remember we would sit on this bench they had, she and I and play cards together for hours on end.</span> <span id="s760">But of course, any book.</span> <span id="s761">Most of the time, I would read.</span> <span id="s762">Now the children -- it was -- for the children it had to be -- there was no education.</span> <span id="s763">I mean, nobody -- there were no classes, there was not -- no school, except you know, my fa -- my mother would try, but di -- we didn’t go to school.</span> <span id="s764">We just -- it was just drifting every day.</span> <span id="s765">Get up in the morning, get washed, spend a little time with my mother.</span> <span id="s766">Find Truda, who le -- who was in the barracks, in the same barracks, but down, and -- and play together and then go outside if it was at all permissible, you know, and then go visit the -- my father and then come and stay with my parents.</span> <span id="s767">It was -- it was a non-existence.</span> <span id="s768">The only thing that really, really saved me wer -- were the books, was reading.</span> <span id="s769">The other children -- and when I talked to Truda about it she says, what did we do?</span> <span id="s770">I said, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s771">She says, I know we played some cards.</span> <span id="s772">They were -- we’re all in the same boat.</span> <span id="s773">It was a non-existence.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q: Did your mother or father make any distinction about Friday night?</span> <span id="s775">Friday night Shabbat?</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: No.</span> <span id="s777">You mean -- you mean -- oh, ma -- my father did come to conduct a little services on Friday night, yeah, for the women, yes he did, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s778">On Friday night he came.</span> <span id="s779">And -- and -- I mean, there were -- the holidays, I mean, there was -- oh, and I will tell you something else.</span> <span id="s780">I was there for Passover.</span> <span id="s781">If a -- if you live to be a thousand years old you’re never going to guess who sent the Jews matzo in -- in Gurs.</span> <span id="s782">The Japanese sent boxes of matzos.</span> <span id="s783">I swear, it said in the back, Nippon.</span> <span id="s784">Can you believe it?</span> <span id="s785">It was so amazing, I mean, and we did have matzo for Passover, and that’s how I knew it was Passover, my father told us.</span> <span id="s786">And right after that I left.</span> <span id="s787">But -- of course, Hanukah came there was nothing, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Q: Who were the guards?</span> <span id="s789">Were they French guards and did you understand any French?</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: No, they were all Germans and they had their groupies with them, they had these women who I guess were -- must have been prostitutes, but they were very glamorous.</span> <span id="s791">You know, to me they were very glamorous, they were clean, they had polished nails, I mean, you know, and they had them living there.</span> <span id="s792">And they were German soldiers, they were all German.</span> <span id="s793">They were German soldiers, not SS.</span> <span id="s794">I think the SS were sort of -- the commandant may have been SS, but the people guarding -- well, they had a -- they had no problems, they had a -- they had a -- a completely compliant group of prisoners.</span> <span id="s795">I mean, nobody did anything.</span> <span id="s796">I mean, they -- they had nothing to do.</span> <span id="s797">They would stay in those kiosks, you know, along the highway.</span> <span id="s798">Th-There was a highway that ran down and on each side were -- were the barracks.</span> <span id="s799">And there was really nothing for them to do, and we would be walking on -- on -- on the highways once in awhile, but most of the time we did nothing.</span> <span id="s800">It was -- you -- it was impossible to be outside for any length of time because of the mud.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q: Did any of the women bring Sabbath candlesticks with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A: I don’t remember seeing anything like that.</span> <span id="s803">I don’t remember seeing any -- anything that would have reminded them -- reminded us of Shabbas or of the holidays, except, as I said, we did get matzo.</span> <span id="s804">We knew, and I don’t remember t -- th-the menorah or anything being lit.</span> <span id="s805">I think by then, whatever there was, the women themselves had lost hope, or had -- were beginning to give up.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: Did you and your mother and your brother sleep together on a pallet?</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: Yes, and so did my grandmother.</span> <span id="s808">Yeah, they -- we had them together.</span> <span id="s809">And they were sort of lined up, you know, we had --</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: Did you have enough room, or were you crowded in on the pallet?</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: I think it was kind of crowded, but there was a more -- oh, actually, th -- oh, my brother was not with us, my brother was with my father.</span> <span id="s812">The girls --</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: Oh, so when they separated the children --</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A: -- children [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Q: -- they separated the girl children --</span></p> <p><span id="s816">A: Yes, the girls were with -- I mean, the girls were with their mothers and the boys were with their fathers, yeah.</span> <span id="s817">But he -- my brother eventually -- I think there was a problem and my brother did come to us, but not in the beginning.</span> <span id="s818">And I think one of the reasons that happened was because he -- my brother became ill and my father said he should be with his mother.</span> <span id="s819">And, you know -- yet, he missed my mother.</span> <span id="s820">So -- I mean, he was a little boy, and -- and he s -- came -- came with us, and he stayed with us and it was fine, you know.</span> <span id="s821">He -- the thing was that -- that my brother had -- had become very quiet.</span> <span id="s822">He had completely become -- completely -- he was afraid.</span> <span id="s823">When we were at Gurs, I think my brother began to change.</span> <span id="s824">I think it -- it -- it -- I think the final -- the final straw was when we -- when he knew that we were going to be leaving by ourselves, without our parents, that we were going to be going alone.</span> <span id="s825">And I think for the children to know that they were leaving without their parents was very frightening to them.</span> <span id="s826">Because I didn't know.</span> <span id="s827">I mean, the bus -- the truck pulled up and there we were.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: How did your father present this to you initially, that you were going to be leaving?</span> <span id="s829">What -- how did -- do you remember what he said to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: He said very simply, you’re going to America.</span> <span id="s831">And here it was, that wonderful place I was going to go and my brother was going to go, too.</span> <span id="s832">He says, you’re going to go to America.</span> <span id="s833">What I didn’t know was that if I was going to go to America, it’s because they were going to be dead.</span> <span id="s834">And that was the only premise under which I was going to be going to -- I didn’t understand that.</span> <span id="s835">All I knew, I was going to America and I really didn’t give a damn what happened, you know, as long as I was going.</span> <span id="s836">And I just naturally assumed that as soon as I got to America, my parents would be right there -- were coming, you know.</span> <span id="s837">And that’s how he presented it to me and I was -- I said, fine.</span> <span id="s838">I said, I’m going to America.</span> <span id="s839">And I told my brother we’re going to America.</span> <span id="s840">And they came.</span> <span id="s841">Whatever little clothing I had which I -- you know, was no good any more, packed it up, looked at all this mud, which was now a sea of mud again because all -- everything had thawed out and it was, you know, no longer frozen, it was -- had been cold there.</span> <span id="s842">And we got on this truck, all the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: Ho-How many children got with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: I think maybe 20.</span> <span id="s845">And we drove and drove and drove again.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">Q: What did you say to your parents when you were leaving?</span></p> <p><span id="s847">A: I said goodbye to them, and you know, the Germans allowed them to say goodbye to us when we left for the United States, before they took them to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s848">Did you know that?</span> <span id="s849">Did you ever hear that?</span> <span id="s850">After -- I just -- after I went to Marjelier there, when we finally were allowed to go to the United States, they took us past my parents conce -- the concentration camp, near -- near Po.</span> <span id="s851">We went to Po on the way to Spain.</span> <span id="s852">And they stopped the train and allowed the parents to see us one more time.</span> <span id="s853">My parents saw me one more time.</span> <span id="s854">M -- I didn't even recognize my mother, she was so thin, and my father.</span> <span id="s855">And my father gave me a letter which he asked me to destroy, which I should have never destroyed.</span> <span id="s856">It was a wonderful letter to me saying whatever happens, life is for the living, remember we loved you, remember us.</span> <span id="s857">And I -- I -- I destroyed the letter cause he asked to d -- he was afraid that it would be found on me.</span> <span id="s858">And he said, you came from a good family.</span> <span id="s859">You have -- you -- you -- you -- he -- he said, you came from a good family, a family who loved you.</span> <span id="s860">You -- we wanted a -- you were -- you should ha -- you’re very bright, you deserve a wonderful education.</span> <span id="s861">We loved you, both your mother and I.</span> <span id="s862">That this has happened was not meant to be, but I want you to have a life and I don’t want you grieve.</span> <span id="s863">And he says, I don’t want you to hate, because he knew that I would hate, and I did.</span> <span id="s864">I hated with a passion for years.</span> <span id="s865">I mean, I’ve -- I could not forgive it.</span> <span id="s866">It took me long time.</span> <span id="s867">I mean, I would say it took me the better portion of my life to look at anything that was German and not wish it the most horrible things to happen.</span> <span id="s868">When thalidomide happened, to my shame, and I heard there were German babies, I felt not a shred of regret.</span> <span id="s869">When -- when Germany was being rebuilt, I felt nothing but anger and grief that this country should -- but then I began to understand what I said in the outset of this interview, that human beings are capable, all of them, of the most horrific things.</span> <span id="s870">That we have an innate sense of cruelty.</span> <span id="s871">That we have what -- what -- what -- what is referred to as our reptilian system that has never matured, that has never developed, that has never -- that evolution has never taken care of, that re-regresses to this atavistic state of absolute enormous cruelty and rage against another person.</span> <span id="s872">And that’s when I began to forgive the Germans, when I realized that there are people in this country who are perfectly willing and able to destroy others the same way the Germans destroyed us.</span> <span id="s873">So when I left Gurs -- to go back to the original thing -- when I left Gurs and went -- went to Marjelier, there was this enormous castle.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Q: Did you know where you were going?</span> <span id="s875">You get on the truck with these 20 other children, who were the adults with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s876">A: They had two adults with us who had -- somehow, I think -- they were people who came to the concentration camp I should say, to Gurs, who were Jews, who were extremely well dressed.</span> <span id="s877">One of them was our former teacher, not -- not -- not -- it was a former teacher who had taught us at Hebrew school -- I mean, at -- at school, who had been a Jew.</span> <span id="s878">He was a --</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Q: Ins -- in Speyer?</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A: He was extremely well dressed, so was his wife.</span> <span id="s881">I couldn’t understand it, they came to see my mother.</span> <span id="s882">And I afterwards said -- oh, I afterwards said to my mother, oh, they look wonderful.</span> <span id="s883">I mean, they were dressed to the nines.</span> <span id="s884">So my fath -- my mother said something under her breath and I looked at my fa -- gr -- my grandmother, I said, Omar, they look so wonderful.</span> <span id="s885">He said, they sold out to the enemy.</span> <span id="s886">In other words that they betrayed their own people.</span> <span id="s887">They were one of the ones who obviously were able to deal with the Germans in some way, I don’t know how.</span> <span id="s888">I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s889">I’ve never been able to find out or understand how these people looked the way they did.</span> <span id="s890">They were not the only ones.</span> <span id="s891">There were others who came who were also German, who were well dressed, who were obviously on the side of the Germans, or in some kind of collaboration with them, I do not know.</span> <span id="s892">I swear to you Gail, I have never been able to find out.</span> <span id="s893">I tried very hard to find out.</span> <span id="s894">I talked to Gunter about it.</span> <span id="s895">I -- there was --</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Q: These are German Jews, or German non-Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s897">A: German Jews.</span> <span id="s898">Oh no, the non-Jews I could have understood.</span> <span id="s899">But I’ve o -- I’m -- I’m definitely going to find out about it because it -- I hadn’t thought about it for years.</span> <span id="s900">They were elegant.</span> <span id="s901">I mean, they w-wore fashionable clothes and they were very patronizing toward my mother.</span> <span id="s902">They came to see her really out of respect fo-for my father, but they were patronizing.</span> <span id="s903">And they were German.</span> <span id="s904">I mean, they belonged to our synagogue.</span> <span id="s905">So could it be --</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q: So these are Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s907">A: Mm.</span> <span id="s908">So in some way they collabord way -- collaborated with the Germans.</span> <span id="s909">Now my question has always been, in what way?</span> <span id="s910">I mean, what did they get, how did they escape being interned?</span> <span id="s911">How did they escape going to Auschwitz?</span> <span id="s912">How did they survive?</span> <span id="s913">I mean, it was like the French collaborators, you know, who -- who -- who -- like, you know, who sold the -- themselves to the Germans.</span> <span id="s914">And this is what these people had to have -- have done, because they were Jews.</span> <span id="s915">The Christians is another story, you know, but these were Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">Q: But they were coming to save you.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A: No, they --</span></p> <p><span id="s918">Q: To save the children?</span></p> <p><span id="s919">A: No, they -- no, no, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s920">They came to visit us and see sort of -- like they represented the Red Cross kind of thing, but they did -- nothing happened, they just came.</span> <span id="s921">They came to pay their respects and to see what was going on and how could they help, and there was nothing, but ma -- I remember my mother saying, what do you mean, how can you help?</span> <span id="s922">You know, she was angry.</span> <span id="s923">But they left again.</span> <span id="s924">I mean, they were free to come and go as they pleased.</span> <span id="s925">They had come to visit.</span> <span id="s926">From where?</span> <span id="s927">I mean, how do you get to Gurs from Speyer?</span> <span id="s928">And why were they not arrested?</span> <span id="s929">That is -- I have to find -- I mean, I -- I really -- it always bothered me all these years how this could have happened.</span> <span id="s930">But you know, it does happen, so either they betrayed their own people for money, or somehow the Germans were using them in --</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: Do you remember their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A: Yeah, that’s -- no, but Gunter Katz -- one of them was called -- was Lehrer, like te -- like teacher, and his name was Lehrer, but I don’t remember his wife’s name, but Gunter would remember.</span> <span id="s933">He absolutely would remember.</span> <span id="s934">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q: So these people had nothing to do with your being chosen to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s936">A: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s937">I think that came from the -- I think that came from a much -- from an international kind of decision by the United States and other countries.</span> <span id="s938">No, the people that took us to Gurs were probably -- I -- I mean, took us to Marjelier were probably people who were sort of a liaison with all these different programs that had -- they were trying to get some of the children saved, and that we got to Marjelier and I was very bewildered.</span> <span id="s939">And I -- you know, when they said it was a castle, of course, after I -- I read all these books, I expected Cinderella, you know, with a -- well, this was not the place.</span> <span id="s940">I mean, this was a big, big place with a huge entrance.</span> <span id="s941">And very barren, very cold.</span> <span id="s942">Not -- you know, it was set up to take care of children.</span> <span id="s943">I mean, it was not set up to be a salon or anything like that.</span> <span id="s944">And there were lots of children there already.</span> <span id="s945">We were just more.</span> <span id="s946">They had teachers.</span> <span id="s947">They had -- they had ver -- they were very good to us, I mean, they were very nice to us.</span> <span id="s948">They spoke French mostly, and that’s how I learned to s -- really speak French much better.</span> <span id="s949">And they tried -- they tried to be really -- they really tried to educate us.</span> <span id="s950">I think that was one of the big things, they wanted to continue our education and we did go to school.</span> <span id="s951">Now, they gave me a little plot of ground outside for me to plant my own vegetables.</span> <span id="s952">Well, that is the s -- I mean, I can not even grow a weed.</span> <span id="s953">So I was the only one that nothing ever grew for.</span> <span id="s954">They were -- they -- they were -- they were nice to us.</span> <span id="s955">I mean, there was not -- I mean they were not gushing and they were not affectionate at all.</span> <span id="s956">I think they were doing a job, and I think they were also aware of the fact that most of these children were going to be leaving, hopefully, and that new ones would be coming in.</span> <span id="s957">When they finally -- now, there were children who were grieving terribly.</span> <span id="s958">There was a child that came whose mother died in the camp.</span> <span id="s959">She was an only child.</span> <span id="s960">She -- her mother -- she was in my -- she was in -- in -- in Gurs with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">Q: And the mother died in Gurs?</span></p> <p><span id="s962">A: No, the mother died in Auschwitz, but she was the only child of this mother who was either divorced or widowed.</span> <span id="s963">It was the most wrenching thing for that child to leave her mother and for that mother to let her child go.</span> <span id="s964">I -- I mean, I -- I have children and I’m sure you do too.</span> <span id="s965">I keep thinking of handing my child up on a truck, 10 years old, or 11 years old, and in this little c-ca -- girl’s case, six years old, and saying goodbye and letting them go down a road where you don’t know where they’re going.</span> <span id="s966">I mean, my father said America.</span> <span id="s967">I don’t think he knew himself.</span> <span id="s968">The courage it had to take, and not to weep, and not to -- and to control yourself and not let the child see how s -- how anguished you are.</span> <span id="s969">This mother did that.</span> <span id="s970">This child looked like frozen, like a piece of glass when she sat down.</span> <span id="s971">She was beautiful.</span> <span id="s972">Black curls all over her head and she wore this little clean dress that her mother had saved for the occasion and she was sitting there and weeping, I me -- I me -- like a piece of stone with the tears just falling down her cheek.</span> <span id="s973">And terrified, I mean terrified out of her mi-mind.</span> <span id="s974">She’d never been alone, she had never left her mother.</span> <span id="s975">And she -- she was so quiet, you know, she -- her mother had -- must have impressed on her -- she was not in our barracks, that she had to do this, she had to go.</span> <span id="s976">And she had accepted it, but she didn't want to, you know, she kept saying -- and then that night she kept calling for her mother.</span> <span id="s977">I mean, she was a little child.</span> <span id="s978">And th-the teachers would come out and they would talk to her.</span> <span id="s979">As I said, they were not overly affectionate, not doting.</span> <span id="s980">They couldn’t be.</span> <span id="s981">I mean, there were so many children.</span> <span id="s982">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s983">Q: Who were the teachers?</span></p> <p><span id="s984">A: They were French.</span> <span id="s985">I don’t -- I think they were Jewish.</span> <span id="s986">You saw -- saw some of this.</span> <span id="s987">You showed me some of that stu -- they were Jewish.</span> <span id="s988">One was a married couple for sure because they shared the room right where we all slept.</span> <span id="s989">And you know something how -- you know, I keep think -- I-I -- you know, for years I -- I was very smugly saying that these -- that I had absolutely no feelings about this at all, that I was absolutely objective, but when -- when the children were starting to go to America and I wasn’t one of them, there were children that were beginning to leave and they were going to, quote, America.</span> <span id="s990">So one day I’m lying in bed and a spider is walking alongside the bed -- ara -- along my pillow.</span> <span id="s991">And I said to myself, if the spider climbs on my hand and climbs up my arm, I’m going to go to America.</span> <span id="s992">So the spider climbed on my hand and climbed up -- by now I’d probably faint, and climbed up my arm and then stopped and then turned around and climbed down again.</span> <span id="s993">And I swear to you Gail, the next day they came and said, you and your brother are going to America.</span> <span id="s994">Of course, what it meant that I had signed my parents’ death sentence.</span> <span id="s995">I mean, not me, but they had -- were going to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s996">That was the whole point.</span> <span id="s997">These were the families -- the children that left Gurs for America were -- were the children of parents that had been d-designated for Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s998">They had already been named that they would be shipped to Auschwitz, and my parents -- my mother was shipped in the transport of 1942, and this was 1941.</span> <span id="s999">So they were already designated for that.</span> <span id="s1000">My grandmother had already died, and I didn’t know that.</span> <span id="s1001">My grandmother died in -- in ’42 -- I mean, no, she hadn’t died yet.</span> <span id="s1002">She died in February of 1942 and my father -- now this is the thing that I’m not sure about, my father I think died in Gurs.</span> <span id="s1003">I don’t think he died in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1004">They have never been able to determine it.</span> <span id="s1005">On the list it gives his name too, but -- but there are other things that indicate that he died in Gurs, of a massive heart attack, probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Q: O-On what list?</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">A: On the list of transports from Gurs, and I have that here, and -- but I’m going to have to send you copies of all that.</span> <span id="s1008">Which means -- which is a horror to me, when I think that if my grandmother -- I have the death certificate for my grandmother from Germany -- from France, and if my father did die before my mother left for Auschwitz, that meant that my mother went to Auschwitz alone.</span> <span id="s1009">And that I find unendurable.</span> <span id="s1010">I’m hoping that if they went, they went together.</span> <span id="s1011">But i -- I don’t think so, I think my father did go to -- did die there and never got to go -- Auschwitz -- and for him it’s a blessing and for my grandmother certainly it’s a blessing, she was a woman in her 70’s, so -- but for my mother I find it -- and I’m hoping that if -- you know, she did go, that there was somebody with her, that maybe the Alcons were still there, because Truda said her -- of course her parents died in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1012">So maybe all the people from Speyer were still together then, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">Q: Marjelier was a chateau --</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">Q: -- and it was southeast of Tur.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: Yes, yes, and it was a big place that had become a center for -- that somehow had been given over by -- by the French, I assume, to take care of these children until they could be dispersed into different -- to different places.</span> <span id="s1017">Now, this was not occupied France at the time.</span> <span id="s1018">S -- what happened was, as -- as -- I was there only a few months and what happened wa -- is that as we left, other children would come.</span> <span id="s1019">Now, were these children -- how many of these children were from Gurs?</span> <span id="s1020">I think most of them came from Gurs.</span> <span id="s1021">I don’t think they came from ger -- I think -- I -- I’m not sure what other places they could have been coming from.</span> <span id="s1022">I mean, they were not coming from the German concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1023">I don’t know where else they could have been coming fr -- to -- to Marjelier from, because Gurs was really -- there was only Gurs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">Q: Was this mar -- Marjelier sponsored by the OSA, the O-S-A -- O-S-E?</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s1026">I think that’s who did it, yes.</span> <span id="s1027">And I think they -- they were some -- the United States I think did offer to take X number of children.</span> <span id="s1028">I think that’s how they -- you know, I think they -- it was sort of sponsored, an international kind of thing.</span> <span id="s1029">How it came to be, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1030">Certainly when I got there it was already established.</span> <span id="s1031">I mean, we were not the first arrivals, there were children there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">Q: Did you have any contact with your parents when -- once you got to Marjelier?</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">A: No --</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">Q: Between the time you l -- you got there and the time you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">A: No, there was no contact at all.</span> <span id="s1036">As I said, the only time I saw them again was at the end, when we left the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Margitta Cooper.</span> <span id="s1039">This is tape two, side B and I had asked you if you had had any communication with your parents bef -- until the time that you left, and you said no.</span> <span id="s1040">So how was that for you and your brother not to have this communication with your parents?</span> <span id="s1041">You were very young.</span> <span id="s1042">What was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">A: The thing -- you know, as I s -- the thing that was so strange is that I really felt all right about it.</span> <span id="s1044">I -- I -- I think maybe I thought this was just like a temporary thing.</span> <span id="s1045">And the other thing was that I had become -- I -- I think I -- what had happened is that I had become really disaffected.</span> <span id="s1046">I did not realize it, but I think I kind of had become like numb.</span> <span id="s1047">I didn’t think about my parents except in the expectation that I would see them, that this was a temporary situation and that they would eventually be coming.</span> <span id="s1048">I didn't think beyond that.</span> <span id="s1049">I would hear little conversations between the teachers that would make me -- that would frighten me.</span> <span id="s1050">For an example, they were talking about what was happening to some of the children, children that had physical handicaps.</span> <span id="s1051">And -- and that’s, of course, what happened with Becky -- that they were doing things.</span> <span id="s1052">They were very frightened and very uneasy, even about being in Marjelier.</span> <span id="s1053">They were afraid of the Germans coming.</span> <span id="s1054">The Germans had occupied, of course, a part of France, Vichy, France and I would hear little things, that they were always very conscious of being at risk or in danger in some way.</span> <span id="s1055">And that made me nervous.</span> <span id="s1056">And yet I thought, well, I’m -- we here.</span> <span id="s1057">So if I’m here, and Henry and Heinz are here, then my parents can’t be that far behind.</span> <span id="s1058">So it didn’t frighten me.</span> <span id="s1059">I didn't begin to understand that they were not coming until I saw them in Po.</span> <span id="s1060">And then I knew that they were not going to be coming with us to America, that we were going by ourselves.</span> <span id="s1061">But until then, when the train stopped and I saw the parents, I thought well, this is it, you know, we’re -- they’re -- they’re coming back.</span> <span id="s1062">We’re going now.</span> <span id="s1063">We’re going to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">Q: Did you go to school in Marjelier?</span> <span id="s1065">Did they have classes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">Q: What did you learn?</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">A: They had classes in history, we took some math, we -- but it was all in French, so I mean, you know, I -- an-and they taught us how to speak French, of course, and children learn fast.</span> <span id="s1069">And of course there were books, which was wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">Q: Did they give you clothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">A: They gave us clothing, absolutely, we had no clothing.</span> <span id="s1072">They gave us clothing, as I said, they asked us to do -- we did work in the ki -- we kept our own rooms up, I mean the beds -- I mean, there was like a dorm.</span> <span id="s1073">We made our own beds, we -- we cleaned.</span> <span id="s1074">I, like an idiot one day thought it’d be fun to help scrub the floors.</span> <span id="s1075">That taught me never to volunteer again.</span> <span id="s1076">And -- and we worked outside and then la -- on the -- on the -- in the gardens and grew our own vegetables, and it was -- it was -- it was an absolutely work place.</span> <span id="s1077">I mean, you know, the children were not pampered.</span> <span id="s1078">But it -- they -- it saved their lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">Q: And you had enough food?</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">A: Yeah, there was enough food, it was not good.</span> <span id="s1081">Lots and lots of lentils.</span> <span id="s1082">I remember we were loaded with lentils, lots of legumes, n -- very little meat.</span> <span id="s1083">Some milk, some bread.</span> <span id="s1084">Not -- not what you call haute cuisine.</span> <span id="s1085">I mean, it was an -- sufficient for us to survive on.</span> <span id="s1086">There was very little fresh food, I mean, no oranges and things like that.</span> <span id="s1087">Sometimes -- I have always wondered what the neighborhood thought, you know, what the neighbors must have thought of this place and all these children, though I’ll -- although it was pretty isolated, I mean, there were not too many neighboring houses there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">Q: Di-Did you go into the nearby towns at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">A: I don’t think we ever did.</span> <span id="s1090">I don’t think we ever really left.</span> <span id="s1091">There were places for us to roam around and to play in, but we never made visits into a-any neighboring towns, until we left.</span> <span id="s1092">Until finally we had to go and we headed for Marseilles.</span> <span id="s1093">But -- and -- you know, on the train.</span> <span id="s1094">But it was -- it -- it -- it -- the children, again, were very well behaved.</span> <span id="s1095">I think all the children knew there was -- this was not normal.</span> <span id="s1096">You know, that we were going through am -- I mean, when you think of children, ranging from the age, let’s say, of six, seven, to maybe 12 - 13, all strangers to each other, suddenly being thrust into a situation where they never saw their parents, never heard from their parents, having to exist in this way and having absolutely no -- no knowledge of what was to become of them.</span> <span id="s1097">Except for me, I was positive I was going to America.</span> <span id="s1098">My father had said so and I was going.</span> <span id="s1099">But the rest of them didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1100">Everybody wanted to go.</span> <span id="s1101">That was, you know, one of the most triumphant things was was one of the children came to me and said, I’m going to America.</span> <span id="s1102">And that’s when the -- right after that my little spider arrived.</span> <span id="s1103">So, I mean, that was -- it was like getting -- you know, it was like going to look at the bulletin board in college and knowing that you been -- you know, that you’ve gotten the school of your choice.</span> <span id="s1104">This was the dream of every child there, it was to come to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">Q: How many children were there when you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">A: About 80, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">Q: And you mixed with the other children, besides your friend from Speyer?</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s1109">We -- well, my friend from Speyer didn’t come.</span> <span id="s1110">She went later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">A: Yeah, they didn’t come with me.</span> <span id="s1113">Truda an-and Gunter came later, and Truda stayed in France for seven years after that.</span> <span id="s1114">But she never left.</span> <span id="s1115">The thing -- I came with my brother by myself, with other children from gu -- from Gurs, but not Truda.</span> <span id="s1116">No, she said she -- they were very upset when I left because they thought they would never be able to get out, but they did eventually.</span> <span id="s1117">No, these were children from everywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">Q: Did you stay with -- did your brother sleep near you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">A: Yeah, my br -- no, my brother slept with the boys and I slept with the girls.</span> <span id="s1120">And there was like huge dormitories and he was -- you know, and they would come up at night and we were allowed -- they would turn lights out and that was it.</span> <span id="s1121">It was -- it was like -- it was like -- a little bit like being in a camp for the poor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">Q: How was your physical condition, were you a strong child, physically?</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">A: Ye -- yeah, well I became ill on the boat.</span> <span id="s1124">I got rheumatic fever.</span> <span id="s1125">But I was fine then, you know, when I came -- when I -- when I left Marjelier and I was on the transport to Marseilles, they took two children off the train.</span> <span id="s1126">They were friends of ours from Marjelier.</span> <span id="s1127">And it was a sister -- a broth -- a brother and a sister and they had very bad eyesight, they wore very thick glasses.</span> <span id="s1128">And the train stopped, the Germans came and took them off.</span> <span id="s1129">Now, again, I don’t understand that.</span> <span id="s1130">I mean, I’ve never been able to understand why the ger -- the Germans allowed these children to go to the United States, obviously, or the fren -- no, the fr -- no, the French took them off, not the Germans, because we were traveling through unoccupied France at that time, til we got to Marseilles.</span> <span id="s1131">It must have been the French that did that, because the United States would not have allowed them into the country, because they could not see well.</span> <span id="s1132">So when I became very ill, on -- on the train, I had the first attack, I didn’t tell anybody anything cause I knew that they would take me off the train.</span> <span id="s1133">And I was fine when I got to Marseilles.</span> <span id="s1134">And I asked my pediatrician who took care of me here, Dr. Liebolis in -- in Maryland why it would come like this, that I would get this tremendous pain.</span> <span id="s1135">He says -- she says, because that’s what happened.</span> <span id="s1136">She says, it would come, the rum -- rheumatic fever is exactly like that, you have these terrible pains.</span> <span id="s1137">It affects the heart.</span> <span id="s1138">And I was fine when I got to Marseilles.</span> <span id="s1139">When I got on the boat it happened again, and this time was very severe.</span> <span id="s1140">And again I was afraid to say anything.</span> <span id="s1141">But when I got to this country, my brother had a fever, and they don’t allow you in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">Q: Okay, well --</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">A: We’ll go --</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">Q: -- we’ll get to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">A: -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">Q: So, how did you know you were be le -- you would be leaving Marjelier?</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">A: They told -- they came and told -- they called my brother and I into the office of the headmistress and they said we’re going -- you’re going to be leaving next week, you’re going -- and I said, we’re going to America.</span> <span id="s1148">And she says, we are going to America.</span> <span id="s1149">I said, good.</span> <span id="s1150">And I -- I was going to say to them, well when is my mother and father coming, but I somehow didn’t.</span> <span id="s1151">I didn’t.</span> <span id="s1152">So she said to me, you know, we -- gather all your things together, and I did.</span> <span id="s1153">I immediately was ready.</span> <span id="s1154">I mean, I was ready at that moment.</span> <span id="s1155">And they came and they were who -- they were whoever we -- it was a number of children.</span> <span id="s1156">We all lined up.</span> <span id="s1157">They had an -- this car.</span> <span id="s1158">They had cars, not -- not trucks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">Q: It wasn’t everybody in Marjelier at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">A: Oh, no, no, no, no, just a few.</span> <span id="s1161">There were maybe -- how many were -- of us came on the boat?</span> <span id="s1162">I would say maybe 20, that’s about all, came -- again, only the par -- children of those parents that had already been designated.</span> <span id="s1163">And they came -- we -- they took us in cars.</span> <span id="s1164">Now, when we got to -- we went by train to marjel -- to Marseilles.</span> <span id="s1165">What happened that was very interesting is that our leaders, there were two adults that went with us -- and on the train to Marseilles is when Bernard and his sister were taken off, and we never saw --</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">Q: The leaders are Jewish leaders?</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">A: Yes, I think they were Jewish.</span> <span id="s1168">But when -- when we got to Marseilles, something happened and they told us to go very quickly down the steps because there were Germans coming in.</span> <span id="s1169">And whether they thought the Germans would stop us, I don’t know, but I remember absolute panicking.</span> <span id="s1170">I did panic then because she said, go quickly, quietly, down the steps to the trains -- to, you know, wherever we were going, and we -- we all ran very quickly.</span> <span id="s1171">And as I was running, I looked up and I saw the Germans coming and walking up the stairs.</span> <span id="s1172">You know, we were going down one flight, they were coming up another flight and I remember thinking, oh God, ub -- because I saw their uniforms, the yellow uniforms with the swastika and the black pants.</span> <span id="s1173">And that -- I got very frightened cause I thought I would be going to America, and -- you know, and we got --</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Q: Now -- th-this is now October ’41?</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">Q: So you were in Marjelier from April to October?</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">A: -- ‘tober, yes.</span> <span id="s1178">So then we get on the train and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">Q: And you were 12 years old?</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1181">I was not 12 yet.</span> <span id="s1182">I was -- yeah, I was 12, I had turned 12.</span> <span id="s1183">So anyway, we were on the train, and oh --</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">Q: Had you physically matured yet?</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">A: Yes, I was just thinking, they had given me a bra to wear, cause I was starting to show a little bit and I didn’t like that.</span> <span id="s1186">But anyway, I wore the bra and I was getting to be -- well, I was not chubby, but -- I wasn’t chubby, but I was always a little short.</span> <span id="s1187">So anyway, one of the teachers had tilted my head up like this, one of the woman teachers, very nice, I liked her very much, and said, you’re going to be a very pretty woman.</span> <span id="s1188">And I never thought that at all, so I said -- I remember thinking she was cr -- oh, she was right, by the way, I did turn out to be a very pretty woman as I grew up.</span> <span id="s1189">Anyway, not --</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">Q: Had you star -- how did you -- had you started to menstruate yet?</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">A: No, no, no, no, not -- I didn’t do that until I went to the Catholic co-convalescent home in the United States after I had rheumatic fever.</span> <span id="s1192">Catholics and I have a thing, I’m telling you.</span> <span id="s1193">So anyway, I -- we got on the train to Marjelier -- is a -- at mas -- in -- in Marseilles and we headed toward the Spanish border, and that’s -- was the incident with Po and my parents, you know.</span> <span id="s1194">Wi --</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">Q: T-Ta-Talk a little more about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">Q: You did a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">A: Okay, th-the train stopped and they said to us, they said that the parents would be allowed to see their children for five minutes.</span> <span id="s1199">So all -- from Gurs.</span> <span id="s1200">These were all the children from Gurs that were on the train.</span> <span id="s1201">And I looked outside and there was my mother and father and they came on for a minute.</span> <span id="s1202">My mother hu -- my other was almost silent.</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">Q: They came onto the car of the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">A: Yeah, they came into the -- yeah, we were allowed to go -- they were allowed to step into the train, to the compartment.</span> <span id="s1205">And my mother was very quiet.</span> <span id="s1206">I think -- I think she knew.</span> <span id="s1207">I think she knew.</span> <span id="s1208">And she hugged me and she kissed my brother and I and she cried a little.</span> <span id="s1209">And she said, be good.</span> <span id="s1210">She says, be a good girl.</span> <span id="s1211">And I think they must have been shocked by how much I’d grown in those few months.</span> <span id="s1212">And then my father, as I said, gave me the letter, he hugged and kissed me, and I remember -- the thing I remember is when the train was pulling away and I saw them standing there, together, how totally forlorn they were.</span> <span id="s1213">Even as young as I was, I knew that ineffable sadness that every child on the train felt when they looked at their parents.</span> <span id="s1214">Not just me, we all felt it.</span> <span id="s1215">We were absolutely saddened.</span> <span id="s1216">Now a c -- I’m wrong, not all the children’s parents were at Gurs, there were others who came to us afterwards and said, were these your parents?</span> <span id="s1217">So they -- not all the children were from Gurs, some of them were.</span> <span id="s1218">I think most of them, because I remember come -- some one of the girls coming in and say, was that your mother and father and I said yes.</span> <span id="s1219">So it wasn’t her p -- her parents weren’t there.</span> <span id="s1220">But we all knew that pain, you know, that a child feels when they s -- when they suddenly feel that sense of insecurity of not having a parent, a -- any -- it was very frightening to me, and to -- I think to my brother, and the finality of it.</span> <span id="s1221">And when the letter -- when I read the letter to my brother -- my father was saying goodbye, you know, an-an-and I knew that was it.</span> <span id="s1222">I’m so sorry I ever tore it up, but it’s gone.</span> <span id="s1223">Anyway, we left Marseilles, now we head toward wonderful Spain.</span> <span id="s1224">We pull into ma -- this is --</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">Q: What was your brother’s reaction in seeing your parents, on saying goodbye?</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">A: Devastating, he -- devastating.</span> <span id="s1227">He was -- I -- I’m telling you, for my brother the -- these little bits and pieces of life being torn away from him devastated him.</span> <span id="s1228">I think he -- he became ap -- he -- h-he -- he looked at this as something that he was totally removed from.</span> <span id="s1229">He went through all the motions, but he had absolutely no feeling with it.</span> <span id="s1230">He behaved normally, but I think my brother was very badly hurt by all this, all his life.</span> <span id="s1231">So then we got t -- we got on the train and it’s traveling, traveling, we pull into Madrid.</span> <span id="s1232">Now, we had been given Gruyere cheese -- cheese, grapes and bread by s -- the people in -- in Marjelier.</span> <span id="s1233">I have never eaten a piece of Gruyere cheese in over 60 years.</span> <span id="s1234">They were starving in Spain.</span> <span id="s1235">This was after the civil war.</span> <span id="s1236">Mother were nursing their children at the depot.</span> <span id="s1237">Soldiers in rags were walking up and down, there was nothing, we gave them all our food.</span> <span id="s1238">All the children did, we handed it through the windows, never realizing that we were going to Lisbon and we would have to have nothing to -- well, we did, we all gave our food away.</span> <span id="s1239">I think partly because we really were sick of the Gruyere, too.</span> <span id="s1240">And the train continued to Lisbon, and we arrived in Lisbon in this beautiful city, have you ever been there?</span> <span id="s1241">You -- it’s still there, I s -- have a friend who went.</span> <span id="s1242">You have this vista of the sea, the medit -- it’s just magnificent, and this beautiful hotel, where they -- these raggedy children arrived.</span> <span id="s1243">I’m sure that hotel concierge probably passed out when he saw us, all these raggedly -- bunch of kids who hadn’t been bathed in days, you know, arriving.</span> <span id="s1244">They gave us bread and butter, the best bread and butter I’ve ever eaten, and I’m telling you, they would bring out trays of it, it would be gone in two seconds.</span> <span id="s1245">They kept bringing out more and more trays of bread and fruit and everything and the minute it was -- we just ate like wolves, I mean -- oh, the other thing was, we -- we did stay in Marseille for about three days and they brought us food there, too.</span> <span id="s1246">That’s where we got the Gruyere cheese and stuff.</span> <span id="s1247">They brought in this wonderful food, I don’t know if it was kosher or not.</span> <span id="s1248">But -- I mean, that was the first time we had really eaten really food -- food since we left Germany.</span> <span id="s1249">I mean, we didn’t -- you know, that we had meat and we had potatoes and we had vegetables, and you know, s -- things.</span> <span id="s1250">And the same thing in Lisbon.</span> <span id="s1251">They brought us all this bread an-and cheeses and fruit and -- and -- and -- and -- and -- and meals that we could actually eat.</span> <span id="s1252">That night they showed movies.</span> <span id="s1253">I had never seen these movies.</span> <span id="s1254">American movies.</span> <span id="s1255">They were in English, I couldn’t understand, but I said, this is America.</span> <span id="s1256">Well, of course, you know, Shirley Temple, I mean, need I say anything else?</span> <span id="s1257">So that was wonderful, those were a wonderful three days because we were washed, our hair was washed, we had clean clothes to put on.</span> <span id="s1258">But, when I got on the boat, I had nothing.</span> <span id="s1259">I had no underwear, nothing.</span> <span id="s1260">So I wore -- I used to wash out my underwear at night and -- and -- and wear it the next day and it was very cold.</span> <span id="s1261">And of course, I was already sick, which didn’t help, you know?</span> <span id="s1262">But on the boat -- we were supposed to sail on this boat and the boat, we missed it in Marseille.</span> <span id="s1263">There was a delay and when we got to Lisbon, this boat had sailed.</span> <span id="s1264">That boat was sunk by a German sub, and we t -- I would have never made it here.</span> <span id="s1265">You would not be listening to this absolutely scintillating story.</span> <span id="s1266">I -- my -- we took the Safir Pinto instead.</span> <span id="s1267">And we left and I was very, very seasick until we got to Casablanca.</span> <span id="s1268">And once we got to Casablanca -- oh, and when I was standing there, you know, I was after -- and you know, being a reader and being very melodramatic, I watched the -- the -- the shores of Europe recede, and I’m thinking to myself, you must remember this moment all your life, that you are now leaving.</span> <span id="s1269">You have to remember this, this is an important moment.</span> <span id="s1270">It’s just like when I saw my parents, I said to myself, you have to remember this, you have to remember them just as they looked.</span> <span id="s1271">You know, I wanted to do that, and I did.</span> <span id="s1272">I’ve never forgotten it.</span> <span id="s1273">Anyway, we got to -- we get to Casablanca and we stayed there for -- oh, I did not see Ingrid or Bogey, I just saw a very dirty island, or dirty city.</span> <span id="s1274">And then we sailed.</span> <span id="s1275">It took us 10 days to come to the United States.</span> <span id="s1276">More than 10 days, like 13 days, with one pair of underpants.</span> <span id="s1277">Very strange food, very elegant first class.</span> <span id="s1278">They had women -- they had a lot of emigrants on that boat, ver -- again, a very motley crew of people in first class.</span> <span id="s1279">Women who were very heavily made up and wore very elegant clothes, and men.</span> <span id="s1280">They pretty much tried to ex -- ignore us because we’re this ragtag bunch of kids, you know, we -- I think we were sort of an object of pity and -- and also embarrassment and guilt, you know?</span> <span id="s1281">That they were having this wonderful time with music playing and dancing and everything and here we were with these big eyes reminding them what was really going on in Europe, and they didn’t want to be reminded.</span> <span id="s1282">I don’t think -- I don’t know how many were Jews or not Jews, but nobody wants -- wanted to be reminded.</span> <span id="s1283">And they were sort of nice.</span> <span id="s1284">But I had my first love affair on the boat because the son of the captain was on the boat, and he liked me.</span> <span id="s1285">And he’d sneak little things for me.</span> <span id="s1286">That’s when I first began to understand the importance of being a female, and what it -- it -- you can derive out of that.</span> <span id="s1287">I got great oranges, all peeled and beautiful.</span> <span id="s1288">I got wonderful sweets and ice cream.</span> <span id="s1289">I mean, he got me lots of goodies.</span> <span id="s1290">And I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">Q: H-How old was he?</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">A: About 13.</span> <span id="s1293">I was 12.</span> <span id="s1294">And he really liked me.</span> <span id="s1295">He would talk to me.</span> <span id="s1296">We didn’t understand one word, I mean he spoke Portuguese and I spoke whatever.</span> <span id="s1297">But we understood each other.</span> <span id="s1298">And I would be sitting there and he’d come up and the steward would be trailing behind him and he’d open up this thing and there would be wonderful goodies, and I was -- became very powerful then.</span> <span id="s1299">Then we got to the United States -- oh, they posed us -- oh, go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">Q: How many children were on the boat with you in your group?</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">A: I’d say about 40.</span> <span id="s1302">About 40, I think, yeah, not that many.</span> <span id="s1303">Yeah, about 40 because we -- when we landed you know, they posed me -- the newspaper, American newspapers posed me.</span> <span id="s1304">It must be still there in -- it’s in the archives of the New York Times for that day.</span> <span id="s1305">They posed my brother and I on the rail of the ship behind the Statue of Liberty.</span> <span id="s1306">The American reporters came to interview us because they heard that the children had come from Europe.</span> <span id="s1307">And that’s how my Uncle Heinz found out, he opened up the New York Times and there on the front page was his niece.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">Q: Now what day, this is October?</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">A: October -- it was October the seventh, I think.</span> <span id="s1310">Anyway, there was his niece sitting there with her -- my brother.</span> <span id="s1311">He -- he cried.</span> <span id="s1312">My uncle, again, also cried.</span> <span id="s1313">Anyway, they took --</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">Q: O-On the ship, did you have any classes, or it was just free time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">A: Oh no, nothing like that.</span> <span id="s1316">No --</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">Q: No English classes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">A: -- no, no, no, but when the -- when the e -- nothing.</span> <span id="s1319">We did nothing but roam the ship, play and do whatever and sit and read.</span> <span id="s1320">Course again, I found books, which was wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">Q: Did you have your cha -- your ho -- your own books with you?</span> <span id="s1322">Had you been able to take them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">A: No, no, no, I brought nothing with me.</span> <span id="s1324">As -- I got on that ship without anything.</span> <span id="s1325">We had little satchel maybe of something, but when I left Lisbon, I really had nothing.</span> <span id="s1326">I mean, I think I had one change of clothing and I really didn’t have any under things at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">Q: When did you have to give up your personal books that you had brought with you from --</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">A: I left them in Gurs for the children, for everybody else that was left.</span> <span id="s1329">I never took them with me.</span> <span id="s1330">No, I would never have done that.</span> <span id="s1331">That’s one thing we learned to do is that we had to -- whatever we could leave for somebody else to use, it became instinctive and we all did that.</span> <span id="s1332">It’s like when we gave all the food to the -- to the Spaniards, I mean, it was just instinctive to do that, we had learned to do that.</span> <span id="s1333">Anyway, when we got on the United States, when the immigration people came on board and the doctors, they took my brother’s temperature and ma -- he had a li-little temperature, so we had to go to this place in -- in -- in Queens or Brooklyn that was like a rehabilitation [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">Q: Wa -- wa -- tell me, before that, what was it like for you to see the Statue of Liberty?</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">A: I hadn’t -- didn’t have a clue.</span> <span id="s1336">I just thou -- looked at this big thing.</span> <span id="s1337">I mean, I didn't know what it was supposed to be.</span> <span id="s1338">Everybody -- I mean, I heard them saying Statue of Liberty, Statue of Liberty and I knew liberté means liberty.</span> <span id="s1339">And I didn’t know what these reporters were all doing around us and then he -- one of them hoisted me up on the rail and he hoisted up my brother and they all yelling and they all talking, and this -- the interpreter is trying to say things and they were taking these pictures.</span> <span id="s1340">He says -- and I do remember this, I understood, how do you like America?</span> <span id="s1341">Are you an -- an-and I didn’t understand and I kept saying yes, yes, you know, oui, oui.</span> <span id="s1342">I didn’t have a clue.</span> <span id="s1343">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">Q: What was it like when you first got off the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">A: It was [indecipherable] that boat -- huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">Q: Oh -- oh -- oh -- and then when you got off the boat and got onto the land?</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">A: When I got off the boat and on the land, the thing that absolutely -- absolutely stunned me is as we walked -- driving through the streets is the outside of the food stores.</span> <span id="s1348">The fruit piled up.</span> <span id="s1349">I could not imagine that human beings had that much to eat.</span> <span id="s1350">I mean, the -- the abundance of everything, and the way people were walking around and the yelling and the screaming and the waving and -- and you know, we were driving through a Jewish section, you know, it was probably like the East Side.</span> <span id="s1351">I mean, the exuberance of this country, after all the quiet and -- and -- and -- and the desolation and the grieving and the mourning that I’ve been subjected to for the last four or five years, you know, that unconsciously I had absorbed.</span> <span id="s1352">And now suddenly seeing all this life and this -- the -- the abundance is what -- what did it for me.</span> <span id="s1353">I mean, I -- I saw oranges this big and people didn’t pay -- I saw a woman eating an ice cream cone.</span> <span id="s1354">I hadn’t seen an ice cream, I didn’t even know what it looked like any more.</span> <span id="s1355">And the thing I fell in love with was chewing gum.</span> <span id="s1356">The driver of the car says, would you like chewing gum?</span> <span id="s1357">I couldn’t understand what chewing gum was, but he handed me this thing and he showed me and I chewed it and I loved it.</span> <span id="s1358">And I -- it -- I -- and it was just wonder -- I mean, everything was exhilarating to me.</span> <span id="s1359">I didn’t -- again, I didn’t realize, you know, that this was the prologue to my life here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">Q: So it was you and your brother in the car, and who else?</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">A: Oh, and all the other children.</span> <span id="s1362">It was like a van, like a station wagon, you know.</span> <span id="s1363">We were like in a big bus kind of thing, and they were taking us to this place where -- where there was like a little hospital, and it was really an orphanage, but a very high class orph -- very nice.</span> <span id="s1364">And they kept us there until we could go with foster parents, til my foster parents could take me in Baltimore.</span> <span id="s1365">You know, I came -- went to foster parents, my brother and I.</span> <span id="s1366">You didn’t know that?</span> <span id="s1367">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1368">So anyway, I -- th-that’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">Q: So you stayed in this -- this orphanage for how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">A: Oh, about two or three days.</span> <span id="s1371">And then the m -- the -- the -- Mrs. --</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">Q: What was the name of the orphanage, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">A: Mrs. Beser came from Baltimore, who came with the associated Jewish charities.</span> <span id="s1374">She was their liaison with all this and she came and got my brother and I.</span> <span id="s1375">Her son was the nav -- navigator who dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Jacob Beser.</span> <span id="s1376">Yeah, and he never recovered from that, which I can well understand.</span> <span id="s1377">Anyway, she came and she got us and on the trip to Baltimore -- I had no idea -- oh, in the meantime, my Uncle Heinz came and my Uncle Adolf, they couldn’t take us for some reason or other what had to do cause they weren’t citizens themselves.</span> <span id="s1378">And my father’s family came and wanted us and I decided not to, which was the biggest mistake I ever made in my life.</span> <span id="s1379">I did not want to go with these people, I didn’t know who they were, I -- I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">Q: They ga -- they all came to the orphanage?</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">A: Yes, and -- which was sad because I should have gone with them.</span> <span id="s1382">They were my father’s -- but my uncles didn’t want me to go with them because they didn’t think they were high class enough.</span> <span id="s1383">They were real German snobs and my poor father was Polish, so they never re -- they forgave him because he was so smart, but they could not forgive these people.</span> <span id="s1384">Anyway, it was a big mistake.</span> <span id="s1385">Anyway, went to Baltimore, got another attack of my little rheumatic fever, which I didn't understand, and this time it -- it got better but it didn’t stay better.</span> <span id="s1386">I ended up going to Sinai Hospital in Baltimore.</span> <span id="s1387">And I met my foster parents.</span> <span id="s1388">They were probably good people, but I think were doing it for the wrong reasons, they were doing it for financial reasons, with some compassion.</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Margitta Cooper.</span> <span id="s1391">This is tape number three, side A.</span> <span id="s1392">You have arrived in the United States and Mrs. Beser came and took y -- and then you were told you were going to Baltimore?</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1394">And -- and I -- well, I became ill on the train again, you know, that -- that last -- I think it was like the last attack, that was like the third one.</span> <span id="s1395">And again I kind of tried not to give into it because I was still very frightened, but it really kind of overwhelmed me and eventually I ended up going to Sinai Hospital.</span> <span id="s1396">I s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">Q: Thi-Thi-This is the train from New York to Baltimore?</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">A: And then I -- I-I went to meet --</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">Q: In -- in October 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">Q: So you are 12 years old?</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1403">And what happened was I was ill.</span> <span id="s1404">I met my -- I did -- I met my new foster parents that night, and as I said, part -- they had various reasons for doing it.</span> <span id="s1405">I don’t think they were the right reasons and I don’t think they were the right people for us.</span> <span id="s1406">My brother eventually went to another foster home, and so did I.</span> <span id="s1407">But they were not, in any way, abusive.</span> <span id="s1408">My foster father, unfortunately developed an affection for me which wasn’t quite what it should have been.</span> <span id="s1409">It wasn’t paternal, let’s put it that way.</span> <span id="s1410">So it was -- it was not a great experience for me, but it wasn’t horrible either, I mean, nothing terrible happened to me, except that I did go to the hospital, I couldn’t speak English, I -- they were very concerned that they didn’t -- couldn’t -- didn’t know exactly what was happening to me.</span> <span id="s1411">I had a wonderful pediatrician who was taking care of me.</span> <span id="s1412">Her name was Lucille Liebolis, and she’s very well known.</span> <span id="s1413">And -- and I was at Sinai Hospital in Baltimore and a lot of young doctors came in and tried to speak to me and I couldn’t really understand them.</span> <span id="s1414">And finally a -- a rabbi came in from Ohav Shalom and he was doctor -- oh God, he was a rabbi before, Rabbi Shaw, I can’t even remember his name, but he had come in and said he had met my father in -- in -- in Germany, and he spoke to me in what was passable German, and so he finally explained to me what was happening to me and why I was there, and what they were trying to do to me, because I wasn’t sure what -- what they were doing.</span> <span id="s1415">Anyway, I stayed there for six weeks.</span> <span id="s1416">After I came out of there --</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">Q: Did your foster parents continually visit you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">A: Once in awhile they did come, yes.</span> <span id="s1419">Absolutely they came.</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">Q: What about your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">A: My brother did too.</span> <span id="s1422">But -- but what happened in between is that the United States went to war.</span> <span id="s1423">And I remember all the brouhaha that was going around.</span> <span id="s1424">I had become friendly with the little girl next -- in the cubicle next to me who had had polio.</span> <span id="s1425">And that was really horrible what they were doing to her because they were using the kes -- Sister Kenny’s system with the hot towels.</span> <span id="s1426">Anyway, she and I became friends and my favorite occupation with her was singing, “You Are My Sunshine.”</span> <span id="s1427">We sang it day and night, we drove everybody insane.</span> <span id="s1428">But I heard all this going on and somebody explained to me and I was speaking a little English, that the United States was at war.</span> <span id="s1429">And somebody came in and said to me in Yiddish, the United States, it is kreig, is at war, and he said -- I mean, I said, e -- yes?</span> <span id="s1430">He said, we are at war with Japan and Germany.</span> <span id="s1431">And I couldn’t understand that, I thought everybody was at war.</span> <span id="s1432">I didn’t realize the United States were not at war, I thought the whole world was at -- that wasn’t -- that was no big deal.</span> <span id="s1433">Anyway, that’s what happened when I was in the hospital.</span> <span id="s1434">I came out, I went to a convalescent center, Saint something in Catonsville in maryl -- in Baltimore, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">Q: Did you know Yiddish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">A: No, but the words, the many words that are similar in a di -- you know, they are close.</span> <span id="s1437">I couldn’t speak -- I only sp -- only spoke German, but there are people who speak Yiddish who can make themselves understood very easily.</span> <span id="s1438">Anyway, I went to this Catholic convalescent home and I stayed there for another six weeks, altogether.</span> <span id="s1439">Then they told me at that time, Dr. Liebolis told me I would never have children, that I had a very bad heart.</span> <span id="s1440">I went to the William S. Baer School for crippled children with horrifically handicapped children, but very nice.</span> <span id="s1441">I -- it was a very nice experience for me.</span> <span id="s1442">They were very nice to me.</span> <span id="s1443">And I -- then after that I went to Western High School.</span> <span id="s1444">I sat for a scholarship to Barnard, but I met my husband --</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">Q: Well, now wait a minute, you -- you -- so you went to live with your foster parents after you got out of this --</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">Q: -- special school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">A: Yeah, yes -- oh yeah, I went back to them, but th --</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">Q: What were the names of your foster parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">A: Snowhite, if -- if you can believe it.</span> <span id="s1451">Jules and Ceil Snowhite.</span> <span id="s1452">I know.</span> <span id="s1453">Yeah, I couldn’t believe it either once I understood what the word meant.</span> <span id="s1454">Anyway, I did go back to them and then I was transferred out from there to another foster family called Maniken, where I met my husband, because he had been their foster child, too.</span> <span id="s1455">My husband --</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">Q: Wa -- wa -- why -- why did you leave snow -- the Snowhites?</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">A: Because Mrs. Beser, I think they all decided that it was not a good situation.</span> <span id="s1458">She had another child.</span> <span id="s1459">They were a very young couple, and they had another baby and they really had no room for me.</span> <span id="s1460">I mean, once the baby came they needed the rooms.</span> <span id="s1461">My brother had already gone by then to another foster family, the Kolectors, and I went to the Manikens, and -- and my husband had come from Germany in 1938.</span> <span id="s1462">There were two brothers, Walter Grunberg -- my maiden name and my married name became the same.</span> <span id="s1463">And I know, it’s a -- yo-you’ve got the weirdest interview here e -- in history.</span> <span id="s1464">And his brother Manfred had come.</span> <span id="s1465">His brother Manfred had enlisted in the American army and was killed as a navigator, he was shot down over Germany.</span> <span id="s1466">If that is not irony I cannot tell you what else would be.</span> <span id="s1467">Anyway, Walter was there.</span> <span id="s1468">She had taken the boys in -- she took five German boys, German refugees, Jewish children, in.</span> <span id="s1469">My -- the two Grunberg brothers plus the three Mann brothers.</span> <span id="s1470">There were three brothers there.</span> <span id="s1471">So there were five altogether.</span> <span id="s1472">Well, they were all gone by the time I got there, they were all either in the service -- the only one that was left was Walter and I hated him and he hated me and we never got along, until one day when I was about 17, he says, you doing anything?</span> <span id="s1473">I said no.</span> <span id="s1474">He says, I’ll take you to the movies, I said okay.</span> <span id="s1475">So he went -- he took me to a movie with his friend Frank.</span> <span id="s1476">My date consisted of me trailing behind -- behind them, while they were talking to each other.</span> <span id="s1477">They never looked at me, never talked to me.</span> <span id="s1478">I remember the movie, was called “The Jolson Story” with Al -- and I came -- then when -- what ha -- I don’t know what happened -- oh, I know, we -- he says, you want something to eat?</span> <span id="s1479">I said yes.</span> <span id="s1480">So we went to Nate’s [indecipherable], which was a very famous deli in Baltimore, and Frank says, I’ve got to go.</span> <span id="s1481">So, he left and Walter and I s -- began to speak to each other for the first time like human beings, instead of snarling at each other all the time.</span> <span id="s1482">And I really liked him.</span> <span id="s1483">And he really liked me.</span> <span id="s1484">He had been engaged before, didn’t work out, and he was very handsome.</span> <span id="s1485">He is my children’s father.</span> <span id="s1486">And we started going out.</span> <span id="s1487">Mrs. Maniken was outraged.</span> <span id="s1488">Not for any sexual reasons.</span> <span id="s1489">Not because she thought I was not going to be a -- you know, that there was going to be anything pornographic going on under her roof, or anything obscene or that I was doing anything bad, no.</span> <span id="s1490">Walter was very generous financially.</span> <span id="s1491">He bought her lots of gifts, he had no obligations, he was working.</span> <span id="s1492">So she wasn’t too happy about that.</span> <span id="s1493">But he asked me to marry him, and I said yes, for all the wrong reasons.</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">Q: How old were you then?</span> <span id="s1495">A: I was going to be 18.</span> <span id="s1496">I didn’t deci -- I was not the -- which meant I was not going to go to college, I was going to be married.</span> <span id="s1497">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">Q: And he was how old?</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">A: Walter was 24.</span> <span id="s1500">He was born in 1925, so he -- he was four years older than I was, so he was -- no, if I was -- he was about -- he was born in 1923, I’m sorry, ’23, I was born in ’29, he was six years older than I was, so he was about 24 then, almost 24.</span> <span id="s1501">I wanted to be my own person.</span> <span id="s1502">I wanted to be free.</span> <span id="s1503">I didn’t -- I didn’t want to live under anybody’s roof any more.</span> <span id="s1504">I wanted to -- I -- you know.</span> <span id="s1505">So I married Walter.</span> <span id="s1506">I cared about him, he was a very nice -- he was a very decent man, and he always loved me til the day he died.</span> <span id="s1507">I had my son about two years later, which was wonderful.</span> <span id="s1508">Then I had my daughter four years after that, and then I wanted a divorce, for no imaginable reason under the sun except I wa -- had met a psychiatrist.</span> <span id="s1509">He promised me the earth and the moon and I thought, I don’t want to struggle any more, I want everything easy.</span> <span id="s1510">I was very immature.</span> <span id="s1511">That’s where children who are -- have to grow up so quickly, in one aspect of their lives and have no chance to mature in the normal things -- I did not have the chance to be a child, ha -- be a teenager.</span> <span id="s1512">I never had the time to do any of those things.</span> <span id="s1513">I was catapulted from one event to another.</span> <span id="s1514">And adjusting to new people, adjusting to more new people, adjusting to a school, learning a language.</span> <span id="s1515">There is no excuse.</span> <span id="s1516">I’m not making any excuses for myself because that’s not the reason I’m saying it.</span> <span id="s1517">I’m simply saying that behavior that is aberrant among people -- from people that have gone through a lot of trauma has -- there are explanations.</span> <span id="s1518">You don’t have to forgive it and you don’t even have to put up with it, but you have to know that it’s going to happen.</span> <span id="s1519">And it did happen with me.</span> <span id="s1520">I was simply not prepared to be a mother.</span> <span id="s1521">I was -- I love my children, I adore them.</span> <span id="s1522">And my children, for some reason, think that I walk on water.</span> <span id="s1523">And I always tell them I don’t understand that because I was really tempted to drown both of you at birth, you know?</span> <span id="s1524">But the thing is that I have done that with my children simply because I love them and respect them.</span> <span id="s1525">But I was not a great mother, I was not a doting mother.</span> <span id="s1526">I was totally self-absorbed, always.</span> <span id="s1527">It took me years to understand that there was a world outside of me, my feelings, my anger, my rage, what had happened to me.</span> <span id="s1528">Not poor me kind of thing, I never felt that.</span> <span id="s1529">I never felt, oh, poor me.</span> <span id="s1530">I always realized how lucky I was.</span> <span id="s1531">But -- but the self-absorption was unconscious.</span> <span id="s1532">I didn’t realize it.</span> <span id="s1533">And so my marriage failed because of that.</span> <span id="s1534">I then --</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">Q: Ca-Can we back up a little bit?</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">Q: When the war was over in 1945, you were 16 about --</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">Q: -- I guess.</span> <span id="s1540">What was -- what did that mean to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">A: I wanted to find my parents and that’s the first thing I did, I went to the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s1542">And they came back and said my parents had died, both.</span> <span id="s1543">They gave me the news that my parents were both dead, but they gave me the wrong dates.</span> <span id="s1544">They told me my parents -- and for years I carried that burden -- they told me that my parents had died in May of 1945, maybe 20 days before the war was over, which I fi -- again, found intolerable.</span> <span id="s1545">If I had known they had died in the beginning of 19 -- in th -- in 1942, when there was no end to the war in sight, it wouldn’t have been so horrific, but for me to realize that, you know, they could have lived another 20 -- well, i -- that was a mistake, they had made the mistake.</span> <span id="s1546">It was one of those things that happened.</span> <span id="s1547">But they told me that both my parents were dead.</span> <span id="s1548">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">Q: What -- be-besides the timing of it, what were your reactions?</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">A: Well, my reaction was -- it only fed into my rage and anger.</span> <span id="s1551">I mean, it only fed by what was now, by now a full grown hate for -- for what happened to my parents, the fact that -- that this was done to them, and a -- a -- that people -- I mean, I was angry at the United States.</span> <span id="s1552">I found Jews in the United States are forg -- unforgiving -- I -- I wa -- I was unforgiving toward them.</span> <span id="s1553">I felt that they were the smuggest, most complacent -- I attacked them viciously, I mean, with venom.</span> <span id="s1554">I’d say, don’t you ever talk to me about your friend Mr. Roosevelt.</span> <span id="s1555">I said, don’t you ever talk to me and commiserate to me about what happened in Europe while you were all sitting here doing absolutely nothing while your people were dying in concentration -- where were your marches to Washington?</span> <span id="s1556">I mean, I railed and ranted for years.</span> <span id="s1557">And I really made -- I mean, I have a lot of friends, and that they took this crap from me -- I mean, I’m talking about people like Elaine.</span> <span id="s1558">I mean, they’ve been my friends for over 50 years.</span> <span id="s1559">They took it, and they absorbed m -- my anger and their guilt.</span> <span id="s1560">Because they didn’t have anything -- it was their parents, they were young themselves, but I -- you know, I used to go on and on on my little soap box.</span> <span id="s1561">Now I realize, it’s going on he -- I’m sitting here, what am I doing for Israel?</span> <span id="s1562">I’m sending them a few checks?</span> <span id="s1563">Am I raving and ranting and railing and running to Washington saying do something?</span> <span id="s1564">No.</span> <span id="s1565">For my people?</span> <span id="s1566">No, I’m just as complacent as these people were.</span> <span id="s1567">The wheel is round.</span> <span id="s1568">My husband always said that and he is right.</span> <span id="s1569">I personally would like to see Mr. Arafat writhe in agony, but it ain’t gonna happen.</span> <span id="s1570">So, I mean, it -- it -- life goes on.</span> <span id="s1571">Anyway, I got married, I had my children, left my husband, remarried again, disaster.</span> <span id="s1572">Met my third husband who was the gem.</span> <span id="s1573">He was wonderful, as Walter had been.</span> <span id="s1574">And then I went to wor -- when I was married, after my relationship with my psychiatrist broke up and oh -- and I realized it wasn’t going to work, I went to work for the school of medicine, Johns Hopkins, which was one of the highlights of my life.</span> <span id="s1575">I went to work for A. McGee Harvey, who was -- who was chairman of the department of medicine, physician and chief of Johns Hopkins Hospital and the editor of the Journal Medicine.</span> <span id="s1576">And the McGee -- A. McGee Harvey building is named after him at Johns Hopkins Hospital.</span> <span id="s1577">And I went for an interview, and I walk into this room, and this little man is sitting there behind this absolutely cluttered desk in this rather -- rather unimpressive office.</span> <span id="s1578">And I shook hands with him, I had wore kid gloves.</span> <span id="s1579">I shook hands with him and sat down.</span> <span id="s1580">I had failed the test that the employment agency had given me.</span> <span id="s1581">There was a big red X right across th-the exam that she had sent out.</span> <span id="s1582">And I saw it lying there and I figure why is he seeing me?</span> <span id="s1583">So he -- we were chatting and he asked me about everything and I said -- to everything he asked me I said no, cause I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1584">So then I went home.</span> <span id="s1585">I get this call from this man, this personnel director of the Hopkins and he says, Mrs. Grunberg?</span> <span id="s1586">I said yes.</span> <span id="s1587">He says, welcome to Johns Hopkins.</span> <span id="s1588">I said, you mean he -- they hired me?</span> <span id="s1589">He said yes.</span> <span id="s1590">I said, who is that little man?</span> <span id="s1591">I said, who is this Dr. Harvey?</span> <span id="s1592">Well, there was dead silence like my asking do you know who president -- who the president is.</span> <span id="s1593">He says, that is Dr. A. McGee Harvey, very, very coldly.</span> <span id="s1594">He says, he is physician and chief of this hospital and chairman of the department of medicine, and professor of medicine.</span> <span id="s1595">He is the -- the professor or medicine.</span> <span id="s1596">I said oh.</span> <span id="s1597">I said, I’m so glad you didn’t tell me that beforehand because I would have fainted right there on the spot.</span> <span id="s1598">Years later -- oh, when I walked in there was another man sitting in a corner, his name was Kenneth Zeiler.</span> <span id="s1599">Ken Zeiler is one of the geniuses of all time, he was chief of endocrinology.</span> <span id="s1600">Years later I said to Ken, why did ha -- Mark hire me?</span> <span id="s1601">He says, you walked in, you shook hands, you sat down, you looked like a lady and you spoke English.</span> <span id="s1602">I said, not well.</span> <span id="s1603">He said but you -- he says, believe me, you did.</span> <span id="s1604">It was -- you know, and then the other thing that was funny about Ken, I saw him maybe 10 years ago, I said, Ken, I said, you know you were always one of my most favorite people.</span> <span id="s1605">He was also a full professor.</span> <span id="s1606">He says, did you know I was in love with you?</span> <span id="s1607">I said, what?</span> <span id="s1608">He says, I loved you for years.</span> <span id="s1609">I said, Ken, you are married.</span> <span id="s1610">He says, I know.</span> <span id="s1611">I says, there was never -- he says, you never knew, he says, you never realized, he says, but I always loved you.</span> <span id="s1612">I said, you are joining that long list.</span> <span id="s1613">Anyway, that was wonderful, he trained me to be a redactor, you know, and -- and -- with manus -- for manuscripts.</span> <span id="s1614">He put me on the internship committee, on the residency committee, I was in charge of the Lilienthal library.</span> <span id="s1615">I mean, he really trained me and gave me wonderful, wonderful time.</span> <span id="s1616">And then my husband said to me, it’s time for you not -- I’d like you to stop working.</span> <span id="s1617">He said, you don’t need to financially -- but the mean -- in the meantime my mother’s brother died, my Uncle Heinz, and left me money, which was very nice of him.</span> <span id="s1618">And he left it to my brother and my cousin and I, and he was very well-to-do, he was rich man.</span> <span id="s1619">And he -- we split it three ways.</span> <span id="s1620">And -- and my husband was comfortable, so I didn’t -- but I -- I said, okay.</span> <span id="s1621">We joined the cumtr -- country club.</span> <span id="s1622">I became like an adult camp -- you know, we’re going shopping today, we’re playing bridge today, we’re doing mahjong today.</span> <span id="s1623">The skirts are too long, the skirts are too short, they’re wearing boots, they’re not wearing boots.</span> <span id="s1624">Finally got to the point I was going to lose my mind.</span> <span id="s1625">I said to my husband, I have to go do something.</span> <span id="s1626">So I called Ira Morris, a friend of mine, a doctor at Hopkin -- from Hopkins, who had formed a medical group down in east Baltimore, which is a very poor area.</span> <span id="s1627">And he was doing the -- not an HMO, but similar to that, but poor, for the poor.</span> <span id="s1628">And that’s where I met Ellen.</span> <span id="s1629">Wonderful day, 1976.</span> <span id="s1630">She was the -- there was A-Annabelle Scher, Richard Scher -- do you know Annabelle and Richard Scher?</span> <span id="s1631">He does news, he was the anchor and Annabelle was there, Ellen was there, and I went to work for Ira.</span> <span id="s1632">Ira is her dear friend and my dear friend and he’s the one she talks to now all the time about this.</span> <span id="s1633">I called up Ira, I said, Ira, I need to do something.</span> <span id="s1634">He says, what do you want to do, darling?</span> <span id="s1635">He called me the countess.</span> <span id="s1636">He says, Countess, what do you want to do?</span> <span id="s1637">I said, I want to work a couple days a week.</span> <span id="s1638">So he said okay.</span> <span id="s1639">So we went -- I went to work in east Baltimore, which was run by the state and fu -- really funded by the state, for really the -- the -- the -- you know, really people who on Medicaid, you know.</span> <span id="s1640">And Ellen was sort of there the psychologist cum whatever.</span> <span id="s1641">And -- and that’s how I met her and sh -- it was wonderful.</span> <span id="s1642">I mean, it was a wonderful job, I loved it.</span> <span id="s1643">I worked there for like two, three days a week.</span> <span id="s1644">And of course I kind of became the -- like, you know, I became the administrator, I became the hot honcho.</span> <span id="s1645">And that fell apart.</span> <span id="s1646">Ira and the state and Senator Douglas from the state of Maryland parted company.</span> <span id="s1647">Not -- not -- not the -- not -- the state senator.</span> <span id="s1648">And he formed the east -- the central [indecipherable] medical group and I went with him, uh-huh, and stayed there for about another 10 - 12 years.</span> <span id="s1649">Ellen did not come with that, Ellen then, when the whole thing fell apart, it was a very ugly scene, with a lot of newspapers and I was interviewed again, do -- you know, the whole thing.</span> <span id="s1650">Anyway, I went to work for him and then my husband died.</span> <span id="s1651">That was tr-tremendous trauma for me.</span> <span id="s1652">He died in 1980, and that was very hard.</span> <span id="s1653">I f -- think that when you lose a mate, and I’m not pontificating, I don’t think anybody whose never -- whose -- until you’ve been there, it is probably the singlest greatest loss that you can experience.</span> <span id="s1654">Even -- I think even in situations where the marriage hasn’t been that steadfast.</span> <span id="s1655">And people, you know, always say that, but they don’t understand why a person who’s lived with somebody for 30 years and has never had a nice word to say about him all of a sudden is wailing and -- and weeping all over place.</span> <span id="s1656">Well, I’ll tell you why they do.</span> <span id="s1657">I understand.</span> <span id="s1658">It’s because that person is no longer there, it has become an attachment.</span> <span id="s1659">It’s like somebody severing a part of you.</span> <span id="s1660">And that is why suddenly this person becomes saint -- saintly.</span> <span id="s1661">Well, I happen to have liked my husband, so it was really, really hard.</span> <span id="s1662">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1663">Q: Do you think it was harder because you had lost your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">A: Oh, I think so, I think it’s -- a loss for me has always been difficult.</span> <span id="s1665">And it -- I’m basically -- the thing I discovered about myself, which is the final result of all that has happened to me, is that underneath all the bravado, and underneath all this -- this -- this -- that my friends and my children to this day believe that I am the strongest person they know.</span> <span id="s1666">I mean, they admire that -- that underneath all that I am the most fearful, insecure, quivering mass of jelly you have ever seen.</span> <span id="s1667">And they don’t understand that.</span> <span id="s1668">I am terrified of everything.</span> <span id="s1669">And that came much later.</span> <span id="s1670">That did not come when I was young.</span> <span id="s1671">When I was young I had that audacity.</span> <span id="s1672">I decided to leave a husband with two children.</span> <span id="s1673">I had the guts to do all that.</span> <span id="s1674">The -- th-the -- the -- the thing came as I began to understand and as I began to take my life apart and look at it.</span> <span id="s1675">If I had kept it set in concrete the way it was, without ever chiseling away at that -- that -- that -- that -- that thing that I encased everything into.</span> <span id="s1676">If I hadn’t broken that thing apart to look at it, what was in there, if I kept it encapsulated, I wouldn’t be so fearful.</span> <span id="s1677">But I think in doing that I unleashed, literally, the fear that -- and -- and -- and -- and -- and the terror that I experienced as a child, that I was -- that I just buried, and -- and closed up and -- and -- and -- until it became hardened.</span> <span id="s1678">And that’s what -- that’s what I did.</span> <span id="s1679">I don’t -- I’m not sorry I did it because in a way it set me free in other areas.</span> <span id="s1680">I don’t -- I’m not so consumed by anger any more and I don’t tend to be as judgmental as I used to be.</span> <span id="s1681">You know, I -- I used to be very critical of people.</span> <span id="s1682">When they talked about the war I looked at them with the utmost superiority and say, well you don’t even know what it is, you know?</span> <span id="s1683">But now I don’t -- but now I do know.</span> <span id="s1684">I think they -- I do know what that is that they felt during the war.</span> <span id="s1685">It may not have been of the -- the -- the -- the epic proportions that we did, who were there, over there, but certainly they suffered, too.</span> <span id="s1686">Children whose fathers went overseas, and you know, who were left here, alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">Q: When your children were young, and the age that you were then things started to get difficult and your father was taken away and then you were -- did this bring -- did thi -- di-did this trigger memories for you when your children were the age you were in Gurs, or -- you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1688">A: Oh yeah, I think so.</span> <span id="s1689">I think there were times when I would watch my children, and I would think about it.</span> <span id="s1690">I would -- I remember when -- when -- when Bonnie, I think was like -- when I took Bonnie to school the first time, more so than Mark, because Mark went to school happily.</span> <span id="s1691">I mean, he would -- he -- he ran away from me to get into class.</span> <span id="s1692">But Bonnie -- when Bonnie -- I took Bonnie to school and I saw her walk away for the -- for one moment I felt the anguish that my mother must have felt, that I thought about it, I said, my God, she’s only going away for four hours.</span> <span id="s1693">I feel this pain of separation.</span> <span id="s1694">How could my mother have done it?</span> <span id="s1695">And then when I thought about my -- th-then wh-when they did things, like when -- I remember Mark when he was little, ran away once.</span> <span id="s1696">He wandered off with a child.</span> <span id="s1697">In those days we were not afraid of the kind of things that we’re afraid of now, I just was nervous and I was pregnant with Bonnie and when he came home, the first thing that came out of his mouth was, did I miss the Good Humor man, Mommy?</span> <span id="s1698">But again I felt that anguish, that fear, you know, that something had happened to the -- that -- wa -- are my children safe?</span> <span id="s1699">Every -- I remember the scare with -- with Kennedy and the -- and the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1700">Q: The Cuban -- the Cuban Missile Crisis?</span></p> <p><span id="s1701">A: -- Missile Crisis.</span> <span id="s1702">I was at Hopkins.</span> <span id="s1703">My children were in school.</span> <span id="s1704">I remember thinking i -- what are -- how am I gonna find my children?</span> <span id="s1705">Where are my children going to be?</span> <span id="s1706">If there’s a -- an attack, how will I ever get home.</span> <span id="s1707">And I tr -- I was trying to give instructions to my children what they should do.</span> <span id="s1708">Don’t leave.</span> <span id="s1709">I will get to you.</span> <span id="s1710">Daddy and I will find you.</span> <span id="s1711">But the thing was again, I thought all the time, my chil -- I can tell my children I’ll try to get to them, because I have the ability.</span> <span id="s1712">My mother could not leave that camp to come and get me, no matter what happened to me.</span> <span id="s1713">If they told her your child is very sick in Marjelier, my mother could not walk out the door and say, well, I’m going to my daughter, she needs me.</span> <span id="s1714">I cou -- had the freedom to go to my children, and I always told my kids that.</span> <span id="s1715">I always told them that y -- what -- when you see anything done by state -- by a state, if you see a lynching, or if you hear a cross being burned on a lawn, that’s one thing.</span> <span id="s1716">That’s a terrible and ugly thing, but if you ever hear -- if you ever see this government pass a law, by state, by state, that affects you, you get out.</span> <span id="s1717">You do not wait, you run to the nearest exit.</span> <span id="s1718">And they said -- they didn’t understand.</span> <span id="s1719">I said, it is when a government -- when a head of state makes a statement against a group of people, it gives all the rest permission to act against that group.</span> <span id="s1720">So if you ever hear a state -- head of state make a statement, or if y -- Congress ever passes a law that’s inimical to a group, you leave.</span> <span id="s1721">You go wherever they will take you.</span> <span id="s1722">You get out.</span> <span id="s1723">Yeah, as my children grew up, I was very conscious of that.</span> <span id="s1724">I always told them how grateful they should be, and how much this country, good or bad has given them, and that it saved my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">Q: What are your thoughts about ger -- Germany today, do you feel very German?</span> <span id="s1726">Do you still feel German?</span></p> <p><span id="s1727">A: Not at all.</span> <span id="s1728">I feel absolutely American.</span> <span id="s1729">My loyalties are totally to this country.</span> <span id="s1730">I never think about myself as a German, ever, ever.</span> <span id="s1731">It’s interesting -- not because I deliberately did this, it was just a gradual progress.</span> <span id="s1732">It was -- I never thought of myself any more as German, I always thought of myself as Jewish.</span> <span id="s1733">And by Jewish I have tried to explain to my children, who are not religious, but are a -- very Jewish, I always tell them that Jew -- being a Jew is not a religion.</span> <span id="s1734">It is only partly that.</span> <span id="s1735">Being Jewish is -- is a state of mind.</span> <span id="s1736">It is an -- a -- a -- a very -- it is a part of you, it’s an attachment of you.</span> <span id="s1737">It’s something you cannot erase, it is just a fact.</span> <span id="s1738">I said, you are a Jew.</span> <span id="s1739">It is genetic.</span> <span id="s1740">It’s almost like a genetic code, it is there.</span> <span id="s1741">It is the 5,000 years of history.</span> <span id="s1742">And -- and I think myself as a -- an American and as a Jew.</span> <span id="s1743">Probably first as a Jew, and then as an American.</span></p> <p><span id="s1744">End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1745">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Margitta Cooper.</span> <span id="s1746">This is tape three, side B, and you were talking about your feelings of being a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1747">A: I think that’s one thing the Germans did for me is that they made me very conscious of Judaism and being a Jew.</span> <span id="s1748">I think the fact that they hated -- hated Jews so much, and were -- I mean, the whole idea that they were -- that they wanted only one thing, which was to kill all of us, to eradicate us completely, I think reinforced, in me at least, and I think in most Holocaust survivors, especially those who really survived the Holocaust in these -- in the camps, that they -- that -- that part of them re -- th -- I think the -- th-the -- the main thrust now is that they are Jewish.</span> <span id="s1749">That doesn’t mean that they necessarily practice it, but their awareness of it, o-of being a Jew.</span> <span id="s1750">You s -- you asked me how I felt about Germany now, retrospectively?</span> <span id="s1751">I feel that Germany, tomorrow morning under Hitler, another Hitler could do the same thing.</span> <span id="s1752">That has never changed in my -- my opinion has never changed that.</span> <span id="s1753">The -- as I said before, I don’t think they’re unique in that.</span> <span id="s1754">I think they have a parclivity -- proclivity to do that, maybe a little faster, because once you’ve committed murder, the second time it makes it easier.</span> <span id="s1755">I think their denials don’t in any way impress me.</span> <span id="s1756">I think they’re fully capable of relighting the ovens and doing it all over again.</span> <span id="s1757">I’m not being bitter, I’m simply saying what I believe.</span> <span id="s1758">Hopefully their governments will never permit that, because I think ultimately it is not the people who direct those activities, it is the government that does it.</span> <span id="s1759">And people, a -- the people respond to that, to the government’s edicts.</span> <span id="s1760">Germany had behaved in an exemplary fashion in the last 20 years.</span> <span id="s1761">Their government has been democratic.</span> <span id="s1762">The fr -- much more so than the French do -- as far as I’m concerned, the French were as rotten, in their own way, as the Germans were.</span> <span id="s1763">I think ger -- France’s conduct toward Jews during the second war is atrocious.</span> <span id="s1764">The fact that they had a camp like -- camp like Gurs right in the middle of their country without protest, is outrageous.</span> <span id="s1765">The fact that they transported people by the hundreds of thousands across their country to these horror is -- is -- is an indictment against them.</span> <span id="s1766">They’ve never accepted their guilt.</span> <span id="s1767">Only lately I think I’m supposed to be getting 25,000 francs from them for transporting my parents to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1768">So I mean, the whole European -- the -- all of Europe -- the ur -- Austrians, for example, we -- you know, we talk about the Austrians and the anschluss.</span> <span id="s1769">The Austrians were no better than the Germans.</span> <span id="s1770">I mean, all of Europe was corrupted by Hitler, but basically underneath it all, it could never have happened, Hitler could have never achieved what he did if underneath it all wasn’t this enormous wave of anti-Semitism that was allowed to spread and to be acted on.</span> <span id="s1771">That is the calamity of the -- of -- of the second World War and the Jews; it is the fact that the Austrians, the Germans, the French, all the rest were allowed -- not only allowed but encouraged, to act on festering anti-Semitism that had been there for a very, very long time.</span> <span id="s1772">It didn’t happen in 1933, it was there.</span> <span id="s1773">It was simply allowed to come to the surface full force and to be acted on in any way anybody saw fit.</span> <span id="s1774">There’s a lot of anti-Semitism in this country.</span> <span id="s1775">It is suppressed, it is never allowed to be acted on.</span> <span id="s1776">If it was suddenly allowed to be fr -- to -- to free flow, without any reins or checks, I don’t know what would happen here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1777">Q: What do you think are the roots of that anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s1778">A: Well, Christianity, of course.</span> <span id="s1779">I think when you have -- when you ha -- are the child of a father, and I’m talking about now Judaism versus Christianity, and the father does not accept the child, in this case meaning Christ, that is an enormous slap in the face.</span> <span id="s1780">Christians simply cannot understand why Jews do not accept Christ as a godhead.</span> <span id="s1781">That’s the number one cause.</span> <span id="s1782">And for hundreds of years there was this myth promulgated that they -- that we killed, we the Jews killed this child, that’s number one, this chi -- this godhead.</span> <span id="s1783">Number two, the Jews have always been in professions that have been very much -- not necessarily in the professions, they have been the shopkeepers, where money has always been exchanged.</span> <span id="s1784">They have been -- they were the ones who were sent out by the Poles and the Russians to collect taxes.</span> <span id="s1785">They became the hated people who collected taxes.</span> <span id="s1786">They had to collect them because their Christian bosses told them to go out.</span> <span id="s1787">I think they -- and the fact that Jews have had one philosophy, that is to educate, to educate and to educate.</span> <span id="s1788">And they have also done something else that we do, most societies don’t do and we don’t do any more either, which is sad, is that they took the best and the brightest and they married their best and their brightest off to their best and brightest girls, and they gave them the education and those who were a little slower and not quite as bright were put in the corner and say okay, be a good boy because your brother is the smart one, he’s got to learn.</span> <span id="s1789">We did that, so we had -- we had genetically, probably, through hundreds of years had developed a group of people who were very bright, aggressive, and because of our -- because of our -- the nature of our -- of our status in other countries, we’ve become aggressive.</span> <span id="s1790">We have -- we -- we -- we -- we feel that we have to act in order to achieve.</span> <span id="s1791">We have to push and shove in order to get anywhere, even when we don’t have to.</span> <span id="s1792">And I think there is a lot of resentment about that.</span> <span id="s1793">It’s the same resentment that Americans begin to feel about Asians, because they’re thrusting themselves into the forefront of education, of everything, and it’s beg -- an-and it’s -- and now the rest of Americans are beginning to resent them.</span> <span id="s1794">You always resent that.</span> <span id="s1795">Anti-Semitism is a very, very old and sad story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1796">Q: Have -- have you been back to Germany at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1797">A: No, I don’t want to go.</span> <span id="s1798">Ai -- well, that’s not true, I’m starting to think.</span> <span id="s1799">Ellen went to Speyer and she -- she went to see for me, and she sent me back lots of things that look familiar.</span> <span id="s1800">So I’m thinking maybe this year -- m-maybe not this year, but certainly by -- maybe by the end of the year, I’d like to go with my son, he said he would go.</span> <span id="s1801">Just to see where I lived, the house is still intact, everything is intact, the synagogue is intact.</span></p> <p><span id="s1802">Q: How many synagogues were there in Speyer, just the one?</span></p> <p><span id="s1803">A: One, yeah.</span> <span id="s1804">Well, there may have been little ones, but that was the big one, that was the main one.</span> <span id="s1805">And would I go back?</span> <span id="s1806">I think yes.</span> <span id="s1807">My friend Lenore went back to Berlin, they actually paid for her to come, and -- she says otherwise she wouldn’t have gone.</span> <span id="s1808">She says, I would have gone someplace else, but not there.</span> <span id="s1809">But look, life is -- life is -- is -- is -- is a survival.</span> <span id="s1810">When I live -- when I talk to people -- when I’ve the -- the people that I’ve met that have survived the Holocaust are different from the ones who are -- who had -- who didn’t have to deal with it.</span> <span id="s1811">We are different.</span> <span id="s1812">There are distinct differences.</span> <span id="s1813">I don’t think -- I mean, I don’t think my friends or even my children know.</span> <span id="s1814">They think I’m just like everybody else.</span> <span id="s1815">But underneath it all, I think when you start scratching the surface there are this -- there are this -- there are things that make us, that set us apart.</span> <span id="s1816">I never want that, you know, I think I’ve s -- I think I strove very hard not to be a different -- I wanted to be a normal teenager.</span> <span id="s1817">I wanted to be a normal wife and mother.</span> <span id="s1818">I made very sure I dressed the same, I acted the same, I -- I was very much the young American wife, you know.</span> <span id="s1819">I think it’s obvi -- very, very important to me that I should not be any different.</span> <span id="s1820">I didn’t want my children to feel that they had a mother who was, you know, a survivor.</span> <span id="s1821">I mean the -- I-I never talked about it.</span> <span id="s1822">I think -- and I always felt uncomfortable with the way people look at survivors.</span> <span id="s1823">I mean, even I look at them -- I mean, it’s like I’m not one of them.</span> <span id="s1824">Oh, I’m so sorry to hear that, where were you?</span> <span id="s1825">Oh, in Gurs?</span> <span id="s1826">Must have been terrible, tell me all about it, you know?</span> <span id="s1827">I mean, that’s what I’m saying, I never wanted to be like them.</span> <span id="s1828">I never wanted -- I mean, I couldn’t -- I -- if I’d had the number, I would have never shown anybody the number.</span> <span id="s1829">It took me years to understand that it wasn’t my fault, I was not to blame for this.</span> <span id="s1830">I didn't have to assume the guilt for this.</span> <span id="s1831">I felt guilty, so I didn’t want anybody to know, or to remind me.</span> <span id="s1832">I -- in some way being different may -- I felt guilty because I was different.</span> <span id="s1833">I felt guilty because it had happened to me and that -- I don’t know how to explain.</span> <span id="s1834">It’s like a child that gets beaten by a parent and they assume the guilt for the parent like they had done something wro -- well, I felt that maybe something had -- we had done something.</span> <span id="s1835">This is what I said about anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s1836">What did we do that we deserved this?</span> <span id="s1837">We didn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s1838">My parents did nothing.</span> <span id="s1839">Gunter’s parents did nothing.</span> <span id="s1840">I mean, my friends -- they -- we -- there was nothing that any Jew did that deserved them to end up as bones in a gas chamber.</span> <span id="s1841">Nothing that they could have done deserved this.</span> <span id="s1842">And I think that the smugness of even some American Jews when they say, well, you should have fought, you know, f-fight, fight what?</span> <span id="s1843">It came like a bolt out of the blue.</span> <span id="s1844">These were people living normal lives.</span> <span id="s1845">My father did not keep an Uzi under his bed.</span> <span id="s1846">And he was a non-violent man and he could never have de -- done anything.</span> <span id="s1847">Yes, now, 50 years after the fact, you have an Israeli army, and you do have men livin -- men and women in this country who would not tolerate that being done to them.</span> <span id="s1848">But that even -- but in my community, where I live now, they wouldn’t be prepared to fight an a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- the onslaught of a Nazi’s raid.</span> <span id="s1849">So, I mean, you know, it -- it’s -- but I always felt that I didn't want to be -- I always -- when I meet somebody who’s gone through the -- through the whole scenario, which I did not, went to Auschi-schwitz, survived Auschwitz, the fact that they used to be able to talk about it so willingly embarrassed me.</span> <span id="s1850">That was my own s -- reluctance to deal with it, to be different.</span> <span id="s1851">And I don’t know if any of the people that you interviewed have ever told you that they did not -- they didn’t want to be -- they wanted to be like everybody else.</span> <span id="s1852">They wanted to be normal.</span> <span id="s1853">Especially with their very young.</span> <span id="s1854">A child doesn’t want to be -- I mean, my friend Phyllis Coen, who I’m been friends with for over sixt -- for 60 years because I met her when I was 12, in elementary school, sh-sh -- she said she remembers me very well.</span> <span id="s1855">I don’t.</span> <span id="s1856">I don’t remember her because I think I blocked out that thing.</span> <span id="s1857">I didn’t want to be the little girl who sat in class, that everybody was talking about, who was -- had come over from Germany, and her parents didn’t come with her and I think her parents are in a concentration camp, and I think she was in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1858">I didn't want that.</span> <span id="s1859">I wanted to be like them.</span> <span id="s1860">I envied them.</span> <span id="s1861">I envied them being -- going -- I remember I used to -- I always had friends.</span> <span id="s1862">I remember being envious of going to my girlfriend’s house after school and having -- we used to have cookies or milk, or I had a friend who loved tomato soup.</span> <span id="s1863">She would open up cans of tomato soup for me, surely, and I would sit there and have tomato soup.</span> <span id="s1864">And her mother would come in and she’d bend down, she’d kiss her.</span> <span id="s1865">And she always patted me on the head, she always liked me.</span> <span id="s1866">And say, girls, what else do you want?</span> <span id="s1867">But I envied her the normalcy.</span> <span id="s1868">I never had that and I wanted my children to have that.</span> <span id="s1869">You know, I want -- I used to play hopscotch with my children when I -- because I want -- didn’t -- I wanted them to not feel that alienation, and I always wanted to be the same, like a -- of course, I couldn’t be.</span> <span id="s1870">I didn’t have the parents, you know, to make hi -- tomato soup.</span> <span id="s1871">But -- and -- and again, it took me years to understand, that as sad as that was -- and it was sad, it was sad for a little girl not to have a mother and father.</span> <span id="s1872">It was sad for me to have my first period and not know what it was, to see the -- you know, to see it and not understand what was happening to me.</span> <span id="s1873">I thought -- I was ashamed that I had done something wrong, because -- you know.</span> <span id="s1874">Finally somebody explained it.</span> <span id="s1875">But, on the other hand, years later when I used to listen to the stories of what went on in their lives, that looked so glorious to me from the outside, all the neurotic parents and the things that were going on behind closed doors which weren’t so wonderful, I didn’t know that at the time.</span> <span id="s1876">I might not have been so longing for it if I had known that with that -- with everything there comes a price.</span> <span id="s1877">And you know, that being a -- a child, you know, that my -- some of my friends had very tough lives of their own, with their parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s1878">Q: Di-Did you come to any of these newer insights through counseling, or just on your own?</span></p> <p><span id="s1879">A: No, on my own.</span> <span id="s1880">I -- it -- you know, th-through examine -- I guess examining myself a little more and being a little more honest, I think we lied to ourselves so much, unconsciously.</span> <span id="s1881">I mean, I -- I -- I -- you know, when people used to say to me -- I used to say to them, when people would push me a little bit and say to me, Margitta, n -- a -- you know, you just have a trace of an accent, that’s the only way anybody would every know you weren't born in this country, I was so proud of myself, because I had achieved that look, you know, that American look that, you know, that -- that together, put together look and that nobody ever suspected anything.</span> <span id="s1882">And that’s one of the reasons I never wanted to talk about it, because once I did talk about it, or mention anything like that, then I became different, and I didn't want to be different.</span> <span id="s1883">You know, I wanted to spring full grown from a nervous head, you know, as -- as this American young adult.</span> <span id="s1884">Then, as time went on, when I began to realize my anxiety about my children, when I began to underst -- when -- as I said, when I start hacking away that piece of steel inside of me that I had closed in and started to -- opening up and beginning to realize what I had done, I had taken 15 years of my li -- whol -- my first 15 years of life and just shoved it in a corner and pretended it didn’t exist.</span> <span id="s1885">Well, dammit, it did exist, and it was hava -- re -- in some ways going to wreak havoc on me somewhere down the road.</span> <span id="s1886">We p -- I mean, the -- the survivors who won’t deal with it ha -- I-I -- I’m sure -- I-I mean, we’re old now, but through the years I’m sure a lot of them paid a very heavy price, because you cannot ignore what has happened to you.</span> <span id="s1887">I cannot ignore my terror when those men came at that -- to my door at five o’clock in the morning and told my parents to pack up my clothes.</span> <span id="s1888">I cannot -- I can’t alter that, the terror, and the -- what I felt when I saw my father weeping.</span> <span id="s1889">Weeping, sitting there with a shoe in his hand, trying to put his shoe on and weeping because he knew at that moment that his life and my mother’s life and probably my grandmother’s and his children’s lives were over, done with, they were going to die.</span> <span id="s1890">He knew it, because he had fought so hard to get us out and he wouldn’t have done that if he had thought we would live.</span> <span id="s1891">I can never forget my grandmother’s face.</span> <span id="s1892">She had these magnificent big blue eyes, she was a beautiful woman.</span> <span id="s1893">Like, she looked -- she didn't look like my mother, but they were both beautiful, really beautiful.</span> <span id="s1894">Unusually pretty women.</span> <span id="s1895">The way she looked when she looked around, she said, wh-where’s the bed?</span> <span id="s1896">And my mother’s tears when she realized that her mother -- she thought her mother had had a stroke.</span> <span id="s1897">I mean, -- and on this horrible train.</span> <span id="s1898">And the men banging, the soldiers banging on the window, saying give us your jewelry or you’re going to die.</span> <span id="s1899">I mean, those things were real, and my sticking them somewhere there wasn’t going to -- wasn’t going to help me or my children.</span> <span id="s1900">I finally sat my children down and said these are the facts of life, this is what you need to know, this is what really happened.</span> <span id="s1901">I want you to understand it.</span> <span id="s1902">I’m not saying -- telling you this cause I want -- expect you to feel sorry for your mother, because your mother is one of the lucky ones and I’ve had a good life.</span> <span id="s1903">But I want you to understand what happened to your grandparents.</span> <span id="s1904">And I did, I told them everything.</span> <span id="s1905">And then when I got all this crap together for -- for the -- France, I -- I did, I got hysterical.</span> <span id="s1906">I was at Bonnie’s house in Florida and she was Xeroxing and she was looking at something and I looked at it and it was a transport list.</span> <span id="s1907">And I did, I just lost it.</span> <span id="s1908">I lost it at Vad Yashe -- Yad Vashem --</span></p> <p><span id="s1909">Q: Yad Vashem.</span></p> <p><span id="s1910">A: Yeah, in -- in Israel.</span> <span id="s1911">But, for the most part it’s okay.</span> <span id="s1912">I’m fine with it now.</span> <span id="s1913">But I had to deal with it and I think that the Holocaust -- I -- I admire those people who survived.</span> <span id="s1914">I admired what they achieved.</span> <span id="s1915">I look at a man -- ooh -- I look at a man like Wiesel, who is, I think the classic exponent of what human beings can survive and make of themselves.</span> <span id="s1916">And I listened to some of the -- and I’ve listened to others, and I think to myself, they’re so much braver than I was, because they faced it, and they dealt with it.</span> <span id="s1917">I didn’t.</span> <span id="s1918">I just pretended it never happened.</span> <span id="s1919">I made up a fantasy about the whole thing.</span> <span id="s1920">You know, okay I went to Gurs, it wasn’t really bad.</span> <span id="s1921">I had to leave my parents, but it was all right.</span> <span id="s1922">You know, I went si -- to Marjelier, that was okay, too.</span> <span id="s1923">We were in Marseilles, we were afraid of being arrested.</span> <span id="s1924">I had rheumatic fever, fine.</span> <span id="s1925">I’ll survive that, too.</span> <span id="s1926">I mean, those are things -- I went to a hospital, couldn't speak a word of English, they were doing things to me I didn’t understand.</span> <span id="s1927">I mean, those things are things you need to deal with.</span> <span id="s1928">You can’t just blithely say them and think they’re going to go away, they’re not.</span> <span id="s1929">They have -- they affect you.</span> <span id="s1930">And I think that’s what happened to me, I finally through the years learned to deal with it.</span> <span id="s1931">Pretty well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1932">Q: Are there any sights today, or sounds, or smells that trigger memories?</span> <span id="s1933">You -- you -- you gave one of when you took your child to nurser -- to kindergarten and you had to say goodbye and you thought of your mother.</span> <span id="s1934">Are there any other things that you see in the world around you, or hear, that also triggers memories?</span></p> <p><span id="s1935">A: Lots of things.</span> <span id="s1936">Well, as I said, when I smell Gruyere cheese, it always reminds me of that trip.</span> <span id="s1937">Dishwater.</span> <span id="s1938">Dirty dishwater reminds me of Gurs because the soup smelled strange, and I’d smelled a little bit like th -- like cabbage-y.</span> <span id="s1939">I think when I see pictures of -- of -- there was a film with -- which I never an -- I never watch anything that has to do with the concentration camps ever, and I have not seen “Schindler’s List,” I do not -- I have not been to the Holocaust Museum, I haven’t -- the only place I ever went to was Yad Vashem and that was very hard for me.</span> <span id="s1940">But I think it’s time for me to get over that a little bit.</span> <span id="s1941">There’s certain thing, it -- like, I saw a movie with Vanessa Redgrave where she was playing the violin.</span> <span id="s1942">Well, we had -- we had a young woman who had like a flute with her in Gurs, and she would play occasionally.</span> <span id="s1943">So when I hear those plaintive sounds, it reminds me.</span> <span id="s1944">You n -- you never forget.</span> <span id="s1945">Whenever I see pictures of France, you know -- I don’t know where it was, I think couple years ago they were talking about the Pyrenees, and I -- I was right there.</span> <span id="s1946">I mean, I saw it all ag -- all over again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1947">Q: Have you been back to that part of France?</span></p> <p><span id="s1948">A: I’ve never been back to France.</span> <span id="s1949">But I mean, those are things that -- that remind me.</span> <span id="s1950">When I see pictures um -- the second World war, when I see, for example, some old movies that are mi -- that reminds me when I came over here and -- and gila -- “Casablanca” for example, I st -- you know -- I mean there are a lot -- Lisbon, when somebody talks about Lisbon, I’m back, you know, when -- with the bread and baskets.</span> <span id="s1951">Yes, I think there are always memories.</span> <span id="s1952">There are always certain smells that suddenly you are transported back.</span> <span id="s1953">I cannot look at a Bing cherry, that -- without thinking of when Hilda, who was -- used to take care of us, my brother and I, during the summer, and she used to get the Bing cherries with the -- the thing and make earrings for me.</span> <span id="s1954">And I-I remember that all the time.</span> <span id="s1955">I -- when I see old movies that have th -- I mean, “Tarzan,” I loved that book, I read that in concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1956">“An Old Fashioned Girl” by Louisa May Alcott, I read that.</span> <span id="s1957">Those are things I’ll always remember, you know, that I don’t know, it -- it -- it -- it’s -- it’s unexpected, I mean, you don’t look for it, it’s -- just happens and -- and it’s there.</span> <span id="s1958">I mean, you don’t look for those memories, they just happened.</span> <span id="s1959">And I think scent is a very pow -- provocative kind of memory.</span> <span id="s1960">The thing I -- my mother’s birthday and my father’s, I always, you know, think about them.</span> <span id="s1961">I sometimes can’t believe -- I still can’t believe that -- that -- one of the -- I’m sure that you’ve heard this so many times, that I ha -- one of the things that I have never been able to grasp -- I understand it intellectually, but emotionally, how an -- bo -- how c-could I ever be that angry, or that full of hate that I could take women and put them on a cattle car and let those people walk into an oven to die?</span> <span id="s1962">Into a chamber to die?</span> <span id="s1963">Could -- how could that have happened?</span> <span id="s1964">I mean, that’s -- those are moot questions, they’ve been asked a million times.</span> <span id="s1965">How did it happen and why’d it happen.</span> <span id="s1966">But I sometimes think to myself, I was there, I saw these people.</span> <span id="s1967">I understand that after awhile they lose their humanity.</span> <span id="s1968">You do -- no longer look at them as human beings.</span> <span id="s1969">They’ve lost it.</span> <span id="s1970">I mean, they’ve become gray and dirty and with matter hair and they are no longer these attractive people that maybe you saw the first time.</span> <span id="s1971">After awhile they bec -- they shuffle, they don’t walk any more, they have become vacant looking, they have no expression in their eyes.</span> <span id="s1972">But even so, can you do that?</span> <span id="s1973">Can you tell somebody -- send somebody to their death?</span> <span id="s1974">Those are the questions I’ve had about all this applica -- for th-these last 50 years.</span> <span id="s1975">How can we -- how could that have happened?</span> <span id="s1976">How could it have happened to somebody like my mother, who was such an immaculate woman, to end her life that way?</span> <span id="s1977">You know?</span> <span id="s1978">Who was brought up carefully by her own mother, and cherished?</span> <span id="s1979">And yet, ended -- and had to die in that way, for what reason?</span> <span id="s1980">An-And I -- I -- as I said, I became an agnostic when I was 14, but not because of that.</span> <span id="s1981">I must tell you, I never decided there was no God because -- and I still have not decided that because nobody can prove one way or the other.</span> <span id="s1982">The only reason -- it’s not because of my own rage, that had nothing to do with it.</span> <span id="s1983">It just seemed scientifically and logically impossible to me.</span> <span id="s1984">I mean, it’s like, what did I hear, y-yesterday, somebody saying I can’t really believe that people around there flapping with their win -- wings, there are just too many of them.</span> <span id="s1985">But, I mean, I became agnostic because I -- I c -- I couldn’t accept the reality of a -- a -- an organized religion that, you know, of a God.</span> <span id="s1986">I mean, I just -- not because how could he have done -- had that happen.</span> <span id="s1987">That is the -- that is the cry of -- of -- of grief and mourning, how could you let that happen to us, we are your chosen people.</span> <span id="s1988">I always felt that we would have been a lot better off if He’d chosen the Chinese, but you know, but the thing is, that isn’t why I decided.</span> <span id="s1989">And of course, underneath it all I’m just as much of a coward as anybody else and I’m hoping I’m wrong.</span></p> <p><span id="s1990">Q: What about raising your children religiously?</span> <span id="s1991">Did they have any religious education?</span></p> <p><span id="s1992">A: Yes, my children are th -- bar -- bat -- mar -- bon -- they were Bas Mitzvahed and Bar Mitzvahed.</span> <span id="s1993">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1994">Q: Di-Di-Did your brother have a Bar Mitzvah when he was 13?</span></p> <p><span id="s1995">A: Yes, he had a Bar Mitzvah, a very nice one.</span> <span id="s1996">And my nieces, his two daughters were raised and was -- both were Bar Mitzvah and my nieces children were Bar Mitzvah and Bas Mitzvah, yeah, I -- th-the tradition has continued.</span> <span id="s1997">Not in the sense that my father would have.</span></p> <p><span id="s1998">Q: But -- but your children had --</span></p> <p><span id="s1999">A: Oh --</span></p> <p><span id="s2000">Q: -- Hebrew school training?</span></p> <p><span id="s2001">A: Oh, absolutely, and again, they chose -- if they ch -- they choose not to be religious, but they’re very, very conscious, as I said earlier, of being Jewish and the obligation that being a Jew means.</span> <span id="s2002">I mean, I told them, I said, it is not the religion.</span> <span id="s2003">I said, I don’t care if you do not go to shul, or to Temple, I said, but I care very, very much if you ever lose your identity as a Jew.</span> <span id="s2004">That is your first identity, a second identity is that you are an American Jew.</span> <span id="s2005">And I think that’s a big difference.</span> <span id="s2006">You know, I am a Jew.</span> <span id="s2007">I may not be religious, but I am a Jew all the way, and nobody -- I mean, that would be the first thing I would ever tell anybody, I am a Jew, and I’m an American.</span> <span id="s2008">So I think there is, as I said, I think being Jewish is being like a statehood, you know, it’s -- it’s -- it’s -- it’s a very special thing to me.</span> <span id="s2009">And I think that I got from my father, because my father was a very bright man and also a philosopher.</span> <span id="s2010">I mean, he had a philosophy.</span> <span id="s2011">He believed that -- he believed that -- that religion brings with it other things.</span> <span id="s2012">Pride in who you are, in your traditions, in the -- in your -- in the knowledge, in what the -- the contributions that your -- your people have made.</span> <span id="s2013">I mean, if you really think about it, the Jews have contributed one-third of all the Nobel prizes winners in the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s2014">End of Tape Three, Side B Beginning Tape Four, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s2015">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Margitta Cooper.</span> <span id="s2016">This is tape number four, side A, and you were talking about your father, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2017">A: Well, my father was an avid -- my father was an avid reader, like I am.</span> <span id="s2018">That’s one thing he and I shared.</span> <span id="s2019">And the thing was that he also had enormous interest in people, and he was very well liked.</span> <span id="s2020">There was a -- there was a man, I don’t know y -- are you interested in classical music?</span> <span id="s2021">Okay, there was a man that used to be on every Saturday night, cannot think of his name, I have his letter home, who used to c -- do a program on classical music, what was his name?</span> <span id="s2022">Cliff?</span> <span id="s2023">Anyway, he was from Speyer and he was on PBS every Saturday for an hour or two hours and I wrote him a letter once and he wrote me a letter back and he says, your father trained me for my Bar Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s2024">I mean, this is a very famous man, he came from New York, I think he’s dead now.</span> <span id="s2025">Anyway, he says, your father was very nice, he said, but your mother was a lot prettier and I had a crush on her.</span> <span id="s2026">But my father -- the only thing he -- my father ever did for me -- to me that I didn’t like is he made me play the violin instead of the piano.</span> <span id="s2027">But he always used to say to me, what you have in your mind is gold, because nobody can take it from you.</span> <span id="s2028">He said, and for every word you learn, he says, you will get smarter, more intelligent.</span> <span id="s2029">And I said, what do you mean?</span> <span id="s2030">He said well, he says, if you learn a new word today, he said, that means you know that word and you will become more intelligent.</span> <span id="s2031">He says, it’ll help you.</span> <span id="s2032">And it took me years to understand that.</span> <span id="s2033">Then of course, then I read John Milton, and John Milton had said the same thing, vocabulary is a power.</span> <span id="s2034">So I -- I -- that -- you know, he was just -- I miss not have known -- I miss not having known him as an adult, because as a child you hold -- talk to your parent in a different way than I would have, let’s say if he had -- if I had gotten to know him as an adult and he and I could have shared adult thoughts.</span> <span id="s2035">And that I never had the chance to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s2036">Q: What was your brother’s Bar Mitzvah like in 1942?</span></p> <p><span id="s2037">A: Well, my uncle came -- my uncles -- my whole family -- I mean, the family came from Germany -- I mean, from New York, God.</span> <span id="s2038">And his foster parents gave it to him -- well, at that time we were still with Snowhites, so sh -- they gave it.</span> <span id="s2039">And of course, it was really nice.</span> <span id="s2040">We -- he was -- a Bar Mitzvah at an -- an Orthodox synagogue.</span> <span id="s2041">There was a party for him.</span> <span id="s2042">He was shorter than I was at that time, then he grew to be six feet tall.</span> <span id="s2043">And he was very excited, he did very well.</span> <span id="s2044">And the thing I remember, he wore this navy blue suit, you know, how little boys dress for -- and he was reading the Haftorah and he really did very well, and I think -- and I remember my f -- my -- m-my uncle looked at me -- and I’m sure he wa -- I mean, we were all thinking about my father, I mean, that he’s -- could not be there, I mean, he would have trained his own son, you know, for the Bar Mitzvah himself -- that he couldn’t be there.</span> <span id="s2045">But I have to tell you, my Uncle Heinz came to my son’s Bar Mitzvah, too.</span> <span id="s2046">And when my son stood up to go -- you know, to -- to -- and I -- they called his father and I up to the Bima.</span> <span id="s2047">And I remember, of course, I remember what I wore.</span> <span id="s2048">I wore a suit about the color of Jacqueline Kennedy’s, which she wore to Texas, that color pink, and I wore a big hat.</span> <span id="s2049">I really looked great that day.</span> <span id="s2050">And I looked very young.</span> <span id="s2051">I mean, you know, everybody thought I looked like I was 20.</span> <span id="s2052">And we -- I stood up there with him, and when I looked down the tears were rolling down my uncle’s face.</span> <span id="s2053">And I said to him afterwards, I said, Uncle Heinz, I said, why were you crying?</span> <span id="s2054">He says, I thought of how you -- your father would have loved the way your son looked, you have a beautiful son, and how you looked.</span> <span id="s2055">I said, I know.</span> <span id="s2056">Well, I remember my Tante Betty, she was a cousin of my mother’s, we were walking down the aisle when I was getting married to -- to Walter.</span> <span id="s2057">I wore pale blue slipper satin, it was a beautiful gown, and my Uncle Heinz paid for all that too.</span> <span id="s2058">He was, as I said, rich.</span> <span id="s2059">Anyway, I didn’t know how rich he was then.</span> <span id="s2060">I wish I had.</span> <span id="s2061">Anyway -- anyway, I’m walking down the aisle and of course everybody -- I don’t have to tell you, I’m walking down the aisle with my uncle, and of course everybody in -- it was down at the Luxemburger Temple in -- in New York, and everybody knew, oh poor Margaret, poor little orphan, poor little thing, you know, and I knew it and I held my head up very high.</span> <span id="s2062">And my Aunt Margaret had given everybody orders to control themselves, you know.</span> <span id="s2063">Except my Tante Betty.</span> <span id="s2064">As I am walking down the aisle I hear this shriek.</span> <span id="s2065">[indecipherable] I thought to myself, stupid woman.</span> <span id="s2066">And -- you know, she was always very melodramatic.</span> <span id="s2067">I lost two crowns and I feel very self-conscious -- at -- and I didn’t lose them, thank God, I mean the two -- four crowns, actually, the whole thing came out yesterday.</span> <span id="s2068">Four thousand dollars if I’d lost them.</span> <span id="s2069">Anyway, yeah, she as shrieking at the wedding, and my -- Walter turned around to me afterwards -- and I remember thinking my knees were shaking so much, I was so nervous, you know, and I remember Walter didn’t want to laugh, because he heard it, this Margitt.</span> <span id="s2070">Anyway, so I -- aft -- so I -- that part, you know, I’m -- it’s sad that my father never had a chance to see his grandchildren or even his son, or my mother.</span> <span id="s2071">Now, when I was little, I went upstairs once to the attic.</span> <span id="s2072">We had a huge house, it was three stories.</span> <span id="s2073">There, Gail, believe it or not, was a chest, a hope chest that was yay high, maybe two and a half feet high and maybe 70 inches across.</span> <span id="s2074">In that hope chest were sheets, beautiful, lace embroidered sheets with my initial on it and a space for where my husband’s would go.</span> <span id="s2075">Towels.</span> <span id="s2076">Everything ever was so gorgeous I couldn’t wait to get married.</span> <span id="s2077">I never wanted to be married, but I thought this it beautif -- and now I -- you know, I used to think -- that was another thing that used to piss me, excuse me.</span> <span id="s2078">Who got my sheets?</span> <span id="s2079">Who was using M.G. with a little space for the husband?</span> <span id="s2080">All these things.</span> <span id="s2081">My mother’s sterling silver.</span> <span id="s2082">All her bu -- beautiful things gone.</span> <span id="s2083">You know, these were material things, I mean, they don’t make up for a life.</span> <span id="s2084">But when you -- but it -- she had to think about that.</span> <span id="s2085">I mean, I -- I would be thinking -- h-how -- what did she think about in the concentration camp?</span> <span id="s2086">What did she think when she went -- got to Auschwitz?</span> <span id="s2087">What were i -- ow -- I mean, if there is an afterlife.</span> <span id="s2088">Those are the questions I have.</span> <span id="s2089">What did they feel like?</span> <span id="s2090">What did they think once my brother and I were gone?</span> <span id="s2091">What did they think when they saw us on that train going to -- you know, these little children, all these little children hanging out of the train, you know, and looking bewildered.</span> <span id="s2092">And so many of them were -- you know.</span> <span id="s2093">How did that mother feel who let her little seven year old go -- six or seven year old child go, you know, and she was alone.</span> <span id="s2094">She was alone, she had no husband.</span> <span id="s2095">But I would -- I -- I thought about that.</span> <span id="s2096">I think about it, what if my father’s -- if he was dying -- if he had died of a heart attack and didn’t know, that’s one thing.</span> <span id="s2097">But suppose he wa -- had been dying -- suppose he died -- suppose these people died, they knew they were dying, the men, or the women, and they were leaving their mate behind to face something dreadful alone.</span> <span id="s2098">At least if they had each other, there was some support.</span> <span id="s2099">You were not alone in your fear, but if you had -- if you were a husband and you were dying and you were leaving your wife alone to face whatever there was coming -- and I think by now they knew about Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2100">They had to know, they had to know that the camp was being emptied out.</span> <span id="s2101">Where were all these people going?</span> <span id="s2102">They were not going home.</span> <span id="s2103">So they knew they were going someplace terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s2104">Q: Do you and your brother talk about what you went through now?</span> <span id="s2105">Or did you as you were young adults and more mature adults?</span> <span id="s2106">Did you talk about it and do you still talk about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2107">A: My brother -- I approached my brother several times and my brother’s word to me always was, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s2108">There are a few things that he remembers.</span> <span id="s2109">He remembers Marseilles.</span> <span id="s2110">I think he does not remember Marjelier.</span> <span id="s2111">He remembers very little of Gurs, but he remembers.</span> <span id="s2112">But he remembers very little -- if I remem -- mention people to him, he doesn’t remember them.</span> <span id="s2113">I knew he did not remember Gunter Katz at all.</span> <span id="s2114">He didn’t remember Truda.</span> <span id="s2115">He --</span></p> <p><span id="s2116">Q: Do-Does he talk about your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s2117">A: Very little.</span> <span id="s2118">He remembers very little.</span> <span id="s2119">He said my mother -- he -- the thing he said to my sister-in-law about my mother is that he says she was bossy.</span> <span id="s2120">Which was true.</span> <span id="s2121">My mother was firm.</span> <span id="s2122">I mean, she had -- it was her way or no way.</span> <span id="s2123">But he was a very fragile child.</span> <span id="s2124">I mean, even before that, I think he was a very sensitive little boy, and I think he probably suffered in -- more than I did.</span> <span id="s2125">Certainly he had more -- it had more of -- of -- a -- me -- well, he’s not intro -- inpu -- he -- it would not be -- he’s not introspective.</span> <span id="s2126">He does not look into things.</span> <span id="s2127">I think he -- he keeps them covered up.</span> <span id="s2128">I think he -- it was -- it had -- the whole thing was very painful for him and I think he does not want to talk about it at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s2129">Q: When you talk to him, do you talk in German, or in English?</span></p> <p><span id="s2130">A: Only English.</span> <span id="s2131">He doesn’t remember one word of German.</span> <span id="s2132">Not a word.</span> <span id="s2133">Nothing.</span> <span id="s2134">That’s what I meant when I said he just wiped the slate clean, but I mean clean.</span> <span id="s2135">He -- I said to him something once about Gurs and he says, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s2136">And I said something about coming over here in the Safir Pinto, he says, I remember being really seasick.</span> <span id="s2137">I said, you were terribly sea -- he was very seasick.</span> <span id="s2138">But that’s it.</span> <span id="s2139">He remembers being with his foster parents very well.</span> <span id="s2140">From that moment on, he remembers everything.</span> <span id="s2141">I mean, he remembers everything when he came to this country.</span> <span id="s2142">Once he was here, his memory is perfect.</span> <span id="s2143">It was just those time before that, he just doesn’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s2144">Q: Did you fee -- keep up any connection with your first foster parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s2145">A: They’re all dead, long -- oh, you mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s2146">Q: Well, I meant before they died.</span></p> <p><span id="s2147">A: No.</span> <span id="s2148">No, no, no, I think they went back to Philadelphia, which is where I think they wanted to be.</span> <span id="s2149">Oh -- oh -- oh no, they got divorced.</span> <span id="s2150">The Snowhites?</span> <span id="s2151">Q: No, the first -- the first po --</span></p> <p><span id="s2152">A: The Snowhites.</span></p> <p><span id="s2153">Q: Those were your first po --</span></p> <p><span id="s2154">A: Those -- the Manikens were my second.</span> <span id="s2155">The Snowhites got divorced, which -- and she remarried.</span> <span id="s2156">She was really a nice -- she would have been a much nicer lady if she hadn’t been so harassed with two little -- I mean, with one four year old, then two more children coming in what is really now -- was not that big a house.</span> <span id="s2157">And the respon -- and frankly, I wasn't very -- I’m sure I wasn’t very cooperative either, because I wasn’t feel -- and I didn’t like her.</span> <span id="s2158">And I was very puzzled by the whole thing.</span> <span id="s2159">It was not what I expected, you know.</span> <span id="s2160">I think I had -- I’d seen Shirley Temple in “Poor Little Rich Girl.”</span> <span id="s2161">I expected to move into this little mansion, you know, and have a nice little butler named Arthur Treacher taking care of me.</span> <span id="s2162">I never expected to, you know.</span> <span id="s2163">So -- oh, I had illusions of grandeur too, and I was very immature in that sense, too.</span> <span id="s2164">I mean, I wasn't -- I was 12, but I don’t think that I was really a true 12.</span> <span id="s2165">I -- like a -- I was still young, like a child in many ways.</span></p> <p><span id="s2166">Q: But you se -- you had alluded to the first -- your first foster father, but there was no physical abuse or anything.</span> <span id="s2167">Or was there?</span></p> <p><span id="s2168">A: No, sexual abuse.</span></p> <p><span id="s2169">Q: Sexual abuse.</span></p> <p><span id="s2170">A: Yeah, there was.</span> <span id="s2171">There really was, and that’s something my children did not know.</span> <span id="s2172">I think I told Bonnie once a long, long time ago that sometimes things hap -- but I mean, it was limited, let’s put it that way.</span> <span id="s2173">I mean, you know, but he certainly tried.</span> <span id="s2174">And except I was so frightened, I didn’t know, you know?</span> <span id="s2175">And when I told Walter when we were married, he was going to go find him and kill him.</span> <span id="s2176">And you know, I said, that’s not an answer.</span> <span id="s2177">He says, how could he, you were 12 years old.</span> <span id="s2178">I was, I was 12 years old, but I was, you know, starting to develop and -- and it wa -- it -- it happened when I came back from the convalescent home, so I was already almost 13.</span> <span id="s2179">Because I went to the convalescent home in 1942, and si -- and I was going to be 13 in June.</span> <span id="s2180">So, it happened around that time, and it didn’t happen, you know, very often.</span> <span id="s2181">But I just knew he fondled me and I didn’t understand that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2182">Q: Did -- did you report it to anybody?</span></p> <p><span id="s2183">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2184">Q: Did you say anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s2185">A: I never told Mrs. Beser, whom I saw once a month.</span> <span id="s2186">I never told a soul.</span> <span id="s2187">And I did not tell a soul for years and I’m telling you for the first time, except maybe my daughter.</span> <span id="s2188">I just never talked about it.</span> <span id="s2189">It -- now, you know, now of course it’s wonderful cause girls can talk, but in those days, who would have believed me?</span> <span id="s2190">This was a very respectable man.</span> <span id="s2191">They would have thought I was making it up.</span> <span id="s2192">Nobody would have believed me and for years I wouldn’t say anything, I wouldn’t have said anything.</span> <span id="s2193">Because of -- the chances are that somebody would have thought it was -- I was lying and I was -- I was afraid.</span> <span id="s2194">And as I said, he never really harmed me.</span> <span id="s2195">L -- it -- when I told Walter, he believed me.</span> <span id="s2196">I mean, Walter knew that I would never, never lie about something and I -- just there was no reason for me to.</span> <span id="s2197">Look, I had a t -- I had a doctor once, and -- who became very famous, his name was Edgar Berman.</span> <span id="s2198">He wa -- became a famous surgeon, he took my tonsils out when I was 16 years old, and he was doing something with my -- on my boob, I thought it was part of the exam.</span> <span id="s2199">It wasn’t until I was married that I understood that this is not part of an exam.</span> <span id="s2200">But he was doing it, talking to me the whole time, never paid any attention, you know?</span> <span id="s2201">And so I mean, wi -- girls, you know, I -- we don’t -- that -- that didn’t upset me at all because I thought it was -- I had been examined so much in my life and I had so much blood taken and so many EKGs taken and so much stuff, that I just thought it was something new for the tonsillectomy, that it was part of that.</span> <span id="s2202">And it took me, when I was married, about three fo -- I never told Walter about that one.</span> <span id="s2203">I told him enough abou -- but I, you know, I think most young women have an unfortunate experience somewhere along in their lives before they are married, that somebody tries something.</span> <span id="s2204">So it is nothing unusual, nothing exceptional happened to me.</span> <span id="s2205">It was not a rape, it was nothing brutal like that.</span> <span id="s2206">It was just a guy who was, I think maybe not -- I wouldn’t call -- certainly would not have called him a pedophile.</span> <span id="s2207">I just think he was -- I was a young woman growing into maturity and that wa -- and I was in his house, probably, you know, running around in -- in a slip without thinking.</span> <span id="s2208">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2209">Again, we tend to blame ourselves, there’s no excuse for his behavior.</span> <span id="s2210">But that’s what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s2211">Q: Do you get reparations?</span></p> <p><span id="s2212">A: No.</span> <span id="s2213">I never knew I could.</span> <span id="s2214">No, because first of all, I didn’t have loss of -- I didn’t have loss of work.</span> <span id="s2215">The Germans -- the French are now paying for the loss of my par -- mother going to Auschwitz, they’re willing to do that.</span> <span id="s2216">As I said, they’re giving 80,000 francs, which I haven’t gotten yet.</span> <span id="s2217">My brother did, but I haven’t yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s2218">Q: What -- what about your father, the loss of your father, they don’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s2219">A: No.</span> <span id="s2220">No, no, no, no, why would they do that?</span> <span id="s2221">They pay for nothing.</span> <span id="s2222">There are no reparations from Germany.</span> <span id="s2223">Germany only did it for property, and I got something for my house years and years ago.</span> <span id="s2224">Probably I mishandled that -- my brother and I did.</span> <span id="s2225">But, you know, the thing is, they -- they did pay reparations, are you ready for this, to Israel -- to these -- to Israel, is they sent Mercedes-Benz, mer -- that -- I could never understand that, why did they do that?</span> <span id="s2226">As -- as an atonement for what they did?</span></p> <p><span id="s2227">Q: Do you feel totally assimilated now?</span></p> <p><span id="s2228">A: In this country?</span> <span id="s2229">Absolutely.</span> <span id="s2230">Absolutely.</span> <span id="s2231">I mean, I have absolutely nothing left that -- of -- to -- of Europe at all.</span> <span id="s2232">I mean, as I said before, I’ve all -- I’ve -- I’ve considered myself an American from the get-go.</span> <span id="s2233">The thing I feel bad about are the fact that my children have never had a family, that they’ve never had grandparents, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2234">Q: Wh-When they were younger and you hadn’t told them the whole story, what did you say to them when -- about not having grandparents?</span> <span id="s2235">How did you present it to them, before you told them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2236">A: I told them that their grandparents were dead on Daddy’s and Mommy’s side.</span> <span id="s2237">Both of them died in ur -- both died in Europe.</span> <span id="s2238">And then as they got older I told them that both their p -- all four of their grandparents died in concentration camps -- Walter’s did, too.</span> <span id="s2239">So, I said, this is what happened, and then they began to understand.</span> <span id="s2240">I mean, you know, they un -- my children are unusual in the sense they had four grandparents die in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s2241">Walter’s parents died too, and so did mine.</span></p> <p><span id="s2242">Q: Have you been back to Europe at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s2243">A: I’ve never gone back to Europe.</span> <span id="s2244">When I stood dramatically with arms stretched out like Rose in the Titanic saying, I’m leaving, remember this moment, I meant it.</span> <span id="s2245">I was not going to come back.</span> <span id="s2246">But I’m ready now.</span> <span id="s2247">Again, you know, it ta -- it took me -- I’m a little slow.</span> <span id="s2248">But I told the children that I’d be willing to go back to Germany and see, and go back to France, you know, and see something.</span> <span id="s2249">And I’d like them to see th -- first of all, from a thetic point of view, it’s the -- it’s a beautiful country and there’s no reason for them not to see it, you know.</span> <span id="s2250">And thank God they don’t have those memories.</span> <span id="s2251">They’re gonna look at it -- they may look at it with some sorrow for me, but certainly from their point of view, it -- it -- wa -- wa -- there’s no -- there’s noth -- no anguish there for them, you know?</span> <span id="s2252">I mean, they don’t know th -- they never knew their grandparents, so it’s fine.</span> <span id="s2253">I want them to see it.</span> <span id="s2254">It’s -- yeah, go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s2255">Q: What -- this is some time ago, but what were your thoughts during the Eichmann trial?</span></p> <p><span id="s2256">A: That they couldn’t hang him high enough.</span> <span id="s2257">I mean, my feelings for mist -- well, the thing that impressed me about Eichmann is number one, the way they got him.</span> <span id="s2258">And my fervent regret that they never got Mengele.</span> <span id="s2259">But I also felt that he represents to me what I said again earlier, that Germany, under the right kind of Führer could absolutely revert right back to 1932 without any question, because Eichmann was totally, totally unremorseful.</span> <span id="s2260">He was -- did not regret one thing that he did.</span> <span id="s2261">The only thing he regretted is that he was caught.</span> <span id="s2262">He had -- he -- he felt absolutely justified in what he did, which is the -- the horror of the whole thing, is -- is what I s -- wa -- you know, how can you do this to another human being, I asked?</span> <span id="s2263">Well, Eichmann thought that was absolutely justified.</span> <span id="s2264">That is what’s so terrifying.</span> <span id="s2265">Not that these people did things that were aga -- went against the grain.</span> <span id="s2266">These people did things that they felt were for the greater good of -- for all.</span> <span id="s2267">This was for the greater good of Germany.</span> <span id="s2268">They were doing by the -- the -- the -- the -- the ends justified the means -- or the means justified the ends, whatever.</span> <span id="s2269">The point was that they felt what they had done was the thing to do.</span> <span id="s2270">And that’s what’s frightening.</span> <span id="s2271">When people do things that go against them, somewhere they begin to break down.</span> <span id="s2272">Somewhere their conscience begins to catch up with them, but not if you really believe you’re doing the right thing.</span> <span id="s2273">Then you just go on.</span> <span id="s2274">And Eichmann sat in that chair in frozen, like glacial calm, because he was right and they -- his -- th-the people, his accusers, were wrong.</span> <span id="s2275">He was convinced of that.</span> <span id="s2276">And he went to his death believing it.</span> <span id="s2277">So I am convinced that if tomorrow morning a new regime -- I mean, look what the Germans have continued doing to the Turks.</span> <span id="s2278">I mean, whatever their doing to their -- to foreigners, it is there.</span> <span id="s2279">That absolute belief that somewhere along the way, they have achieved some kind of superiority.</span> <span id="s2280">And that everybody else is really just a notch beneath them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2281">Q: Will you -- do you buy German products?</span></p> <p><span id="s2282">A: No.</span> <span id="s2283">No, and my daughter bought a Porsche.</span> <span id="s2284">It was a very dramatic day.</span> <span id="s2285">She said, I saw this little car.</span> <span id="s2286">And I said oh, is that darling, is that adorable.</span> <span id="s2287">It was in Massachusetts.</span> <span id="s2288">She’s a very successful woman.</span> <span id="s2289">So she says hop in, I’ll give you a ride.</span> <span id="s2290">So we drive gila -- Gloucester, which is a lovely fishing town in mas -- loved it.</span> <span id="s2291">And it was a very teeming, raining day and I’m -- I -- I mean, every time we went by this, water would wash over the whole car, it was -- and I jump out and she says, you like it, Mother?</span> <span id="s2292">I said, it -- I’m telling you Bonnie, it’s adorable.</span> <span id="s2293">I said, what kind is it?</span> <span id="s2294">She said, oh, she says, it’s like a little sports coupe.</span> <span id="s2295">And of course, you know your child, right?</span> <span id="s2296">I said, Bonnie, what little sports coupe?</span> <span id="s2297">She said, Mother, she said, now don’t get excited.</span> <span id="s2298">I said, I’m not excited.</span> <span id="s2299">She says, you’re gonna be.</span> <span id="s2300">I said no I’m not, I said, tell me.</span> <span id="s2301">She says, it’s a Porsche.</span> <span id="s2302">I said, a Porsche?</span> <span id="s2303">You bought a -- I said, I guess next you’ll be buying Braun.</span> <span id="s2304">She says, Braun, a coffeemaker?</span> <span id="s2305">I said, oh, you already got one.</span> <span id="s2306">It was a nice car.</span> <span id="s2307">She sold it.</span> <span id="s2308">No, I won’t buy it.</span> <span id="s2309">I -- y-you know, which is really st -- you know, i-it -- a -- i-it -- o-outside of -- inside of me goes this constant battle.</span> <span id="s2310">Am I being really rationable, and -- and -- and normal, and -- not -- or stupid?</span> <span id="s2311">I mean, what am I -- what -- what am I achieving?</span> <span id="s2312">Braun does not miss me.</span> <span id="s2313">The Porsche company will produce cars, BMW is booming and the Volkswagen is back in full swing.</span> <span id="s2314">So what -- what does my boycotting have to do with anything?</span> <span id="s2315">Is it just a matter of principle, or is it just -- am I being absolutely wrong in doing this?</span> <span id="s2316">Those are the questions.</span> <span id="s2317">I know people that -- that did not survive anything, who are American born, who will not buy a German product, because -- out of respect for those who went before.</span> <span id="s2318">And they won’t do it.</span> <span id="s2319">And yet, I know that there are s -- Holocaust survivors, who are wearing the German watches, buying the German cameras, driving the German cars.</span> <span id="s2320">They don’t think it’s anything wro -- so, it’s fine, whatever you want to do, you know.</span> <span id="s2321">I have never bou -- I’ve never had the need to buy it, but I am going to buy the Braun toothpa -- brush, because you know, being what is known as common sense wise, it’s a very good toothbrush.</span></p> <p><span id="s2322">Q: On that note, is there anything else you wa --</span></p> <p><span id="s2323">A: No, I think [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s2324">Q: -- you want to add to what you said today, any other thoughts?</span></p> <p><span id="s2325">A: Well, the only other -- I don’t have another thought besides Braun.</span> <span id="s2326">The thing I think that I would like -- if anyone ever listens to this ramble, the only thing I would like them to n -- remember is that vigilance -- and I’m sure they’re going to hear this on every tape that is in -- in this museum, that vigilance is something that Jews and all people need.</span> <span id="s2327">That human beings need to take care of each other, respect each other.</span> <span id="s2328">I’m not asking them to love each other, because that’s really hard to do, but at least have respect and trust.</span> <span id="s2329">If we have a sense of trust of each other, even if -- when there’s betrayal, and there is bound to be betrayal between peoples, but if there is sufficient trust left, we can survive.</span> <span id="s2330">We can’t survive without it.</span> <span id="s2331">And I think this is the most difficult lessons for man to learn and he hasn’t learned it yet, we haven’t learned it.</span> <span id="s2332">We have not learned it in this year of 2002, we are -- you know, the -- let me end up on a note ma -- of a man much wiser than I will ever be.</span> <span id="s2333">Thucydides wrote a book called “The Peloponnesian Wars.”</span> <span id="s2334">And the book was written, I would say, 1500 to 2000 B.C..</span> <span id="s2335">And he opens the book -- and I’m paraphrasing because I’m not as clever as Thucydides.</span> <span id="s2336">He said, we are once again engaged in a great war, because we have not learned from the past.</span> <span id="s2337">This man wrote this 4,000 years ago.</span> <span id="s2338">And we begin the year 2002, once again engaged in great wars all over this globe.</span> <span id="s2339">We haven’t learned anything.</span> <span id="s2340">And I think if my experience and those who came before me and those who will come after me, will teach anyone, it’s that we need to learn to trust each other and to know something about justice and decency toward each other.</span> <span id="s2341">That’s all I can say.</span></p> <p><span id="s2342">Q: Well that’s a lovely note to end on.</span> <span id="s2343">Thank you very much for doing the interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s2344">A: Thank you.</span> <span id="s2345">Now, I’d like a --</span></p> <p><span id="s2346">Q: This is a -- this
