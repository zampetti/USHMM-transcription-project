id="s327">WH: Just have money...and at that time you didn’t have any money.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">LH: No.</span> <span id="s329">Not.</span> <span id="s330">I accumulated a little.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">WH: ...and I was told this morning that Wasserman employed some people who were refugees.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">LH: That’s right.</span> <span id="s333">No- not all refugees...they knew me and when found out that they can depend on my word, what I say, this I’ll good for it, and I convinced her, that he will not fall on their shoulders, this (inaudible) will take care of them, they agreed to sign for me.</span> <span id="s334">The store will be responsible for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">WH: So Wassserman signed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">LH: So they signed it for me because she (Mrs. Wasserman) knew that I would not-.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">WH: You wouldn’t do it otherwise.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">LH: No.</span> <span id="s339">If he wouldn’t be convinced, and he was (inaudible) but she (Mrs. Wasserman) knew me by then, very well.</span> <span id="s340">And she convinced him to sign it.</span> <span id="s341">And they signed for him, and we brought them to the States, to Oklahoma City, and they stayed with us for a month.</span> <span id="s342">They had a little money saved up...and then they bought a home...and Wasserman gave (the wife) a job...</span></p> <p><span id="s343">WH: What were the people like to you, the American Jews.</span> <span id="s344">Did they look upon you as, like, ‘greener’?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">LH: Like we would have horns coming out of our head.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">WH: Like what happened.</span> <span id="s347">Do you remember what was some of your experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s348">LH: Yes, I do remember.</span> <span id="s349">They used to come into the apartment.</span> <span id="s350">They always says, ‘Oh, how nice and clean, and oye, it smells so good!’</span> <span id="s351">I was cooking something.</span> <span id="s352">They thought, I can’t cook, I can’t do nothing.</span> <span id="s353">Who am I, a ‘greener!’</span> <span id="s354">And when they admired from my (inaudible), when I start speaking English, which I did not too long after because the lady upstairs helped me a lot.</span> <span id="s355">And I was speaking to people who came for the alteration, and so, I learned.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">WH: You didn’t go to night school?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">LH: Nothing.</span> <span id="s358">Didn’t have the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">WH: Didn’t have it (night school)?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">LH: Oh yeh, there was a night school.</span> <span id="s361">I could have gone.</span> <span id="s362">But I didn’t have the time.</span> <span id="s363">You see, I worked during the day.</span> <span id="s364">And then I had to cook supper and then I had to wash and clean and do all the other things.</span> <span id="s365">And so, when-</span></p> <p><span id="s366">WH: What happened, they came in, they said the apartment is so nice?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">LH: Is so clean!</span> <span id="s368">Is so nice!</span> <span id="s369">And small so good!</span> <span id="s370">I cook something.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">WH: They said you spoke English?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">LH: Well, very little at that time.</span> <span id="s373">It was in 1950, ’51.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">WH: What did they think of the refugees?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">LH: Well their opinion was, that we don’t know much.</span> <span id="s376">A bunch of dummies, I guess.</span> <span id="s377">But they learn soon enough to know this was not a bunch- we just people, we don’t know English, but we know to get along in life.</span> <span id="s378">Matter of fact, in later years, there were a lot of people with a lot of admiration for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">WH: In what way did they show it?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">LH: Well we was invited just any place.</span> <span id="s381">Where there were any activities.</span> <span id="s382">We used to go and we used to pay our dues, and we was members of the synagogue from the very beginning.</span> <span id="s383">And of the Hadassah, and of the Sisterhood and all that.</span> <span id="s384">I belonged to all those organizations.</span> <span id="s385">And he did too.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">WH: When you said before that ‘we suffered a lot,’ what was some of the problems that you had?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">LH: Well the biggest when we first came here, we suffered an awful lot because he couldn’t do that kind of work that was given to him.</span> <span id="s388">But he was very determined, and very stubborn, and he was not going to give it up.</span> <span id="s389">When he came home from work, he barely walked in that door.</span> <span id="s390">Dirty.</span> <span id="s391">Smelly.</span> <span id="s392">The first thing he could do is just crawl into the bathroom.</span> <span id="s393">Before he said ‘hello’ just falling into the bath tub.</span> <span id="s394">He soaked, and cleaned and scrubbed.</span> <span id="s395">He was a very clean person.</span> <span id="s396">He was, bless his memory, very clean.</span> <span id="s397">And good looking.</span> <span id="s398">Abby’s good looking, (her second husband) but he was a pretty –I have pictures.</span> <span id="s399">Good looking man...(her voice drops).</span></p> <p><span id="s400">WH: So you’re saying the biggest suffering was the work.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">LH: His work.</span> <span id="s402">He couldn’t take it.</span> <span id="s403">He was very dirty and it was really degrading to him.</span> <span id="s404">Let’s put it this way</span></p> <p><span id="s405">WH: And hard work.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">LH: Very hard work.</span> <span id="s407">He got used to it later and it didn’t come so hard to him, cause you know you get used to tzores.</span> <span id="s408">And he got used to it eventually.</span> <span id="s409">But he was not well.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">WH: Did the Jewish Community Agency here help you at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">LH: No.</span> <span id="s412">I told you they gave me ten dollars.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">WH: But HIAS gave you one month’s rent and then-.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">LH: That was it!</span> <span id="s415">And I didn’t need any more because you see he went to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">WH: Sometimes they had psychological services, counseling, and-.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">LH: No.</span> <span id="s418">That was, no such animal in Oklahoma.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">WH: Helping like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">LH: No.</span> <span id="s421">No.</span> <span id="s422">No.</span> <span id="s423">Oklahoma didn’t have it.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">WH: Were you sorry you came here at any point?</span> <span id="s425">Did you wish you had stayed in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">LH: Well, (sighs) I don’t- I couldn’t, they wouldn’t let us at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">WH: But it’s a free country.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">LH: Yeh, but you see-No, not at that time.</span> <span id="s429">I didn’t know if there’s a free country or not a free country when I first came here.</span> <span id="s430">What did I know.</span> <span id="s431">What DID I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">WH: This is true.</span> <span id="s433">A lot of people said that when they came to Pennsylvania, they thought you needed a visa to go to New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">LH: We didn’t know anything!</span> <span id="s435">We came, they send us to Oklahoma.</span> <span id="s436">We stayed in Oklahoma, and we got there an apartment and he start working.</span> <span id="s437">The first six months wh- the first thing is we came in June.</span> <span id="s438">The hottest month of the year.</span> <span id="s439">No air- conditioning.</span> <span id="s440">Hot as hell...and he’s not used to the hard work.</span> <span id="s441">And, so, when the summer months went by, in the meantime he got a little bit adjusted to the situation, I start making some money and he learned that welding business, and he got a promotion, so he was making pretty good already, so when it came to the holiday season, the first season we didn’t pay a due.</span> <span id="s442">The next year we paid our dues at the synagogue.</span> <span id="s443">And from then on.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">WH: About how many of the survivors came here?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">LH: To Oklahoma?</span> <span id="s446">I think about twenty or twenty something.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">WH: What happened to all of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">LH: Left.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">WH: Left right away?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">LH: Some right away, some a year later.</span> <span id="s451">Some a year and a half later.</span> <span id="s452">But eventually, they all left.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">WH: Where did they go?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">LH: Different cities.</span> <span id="s455">I don’t even know now any-.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">WH: Was Oklahoma disappointed, the Jews here that they left?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">LH: Yes.</span> <span id="s458">Yes.</span> <span id="s459">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">WH: Did they say anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s461">LH: Well yes they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">WH: They criticized you.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">LH: Yes.</span> <span id="s464">It wasn’t worth spending money on them.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">WH: And why do you think you stayed and they left?</span></p> <p><span id="s466">LH: Because he was sick.</span> <span id="s467">And I didn’t want to shlep.</span> <span id="s468">I just was glad to be a situated.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">WH: But if he was healthy, you might have gone?</span></p> <p><span id="s470">LH: Oh, probably.</span> <span id="s471">Probably.</span> <span id="s472">Yeh.</span> <span id="s473">But you see, under those conditions, once we got here, and he got a job, and I start working, we made a living, we made a good living.</span> <span id="s474">We saved a little.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">WH: And you feel grateful to the people here that they sponsored you?</span></p> <p><span id="s476">LH: Yes.</span> <span id="s477">Yes.</span> <span id="s478">In a way, yes.</span> <span id="s479">Because we stayed here, and we made some money, and we kept saving, and we bought a home, and I did sewing.</span> <span id="s480">I took in a boarder and she paid me forty dollars a week.</span> <span id="s481">That was good money.</span> <span id="s482">For a woman board in nursing.</span> <span id="s483">You see, I worked in the hospital during the war.</span> <span id="s484">In a hospital in Poland.</span> <span id="s485">So I- I’m not a nurse, and I’m not anything close, but I had a little idea of how to take care of an older person.</span> <span id="s486">So, I took care of her and walked with her a little bit.</span> <span id="s487">She was sort of crippled.</span> <span id="s488">And he worked, and I did that, and in the meantime, when she went to bed, I did some sewing too.</span> <span id="s489">So I made some money.</span> <span id="s490">We saved up some and bought a duplex.</span> <span id="s491">So we sold the home, we moved into the duplex and then we bought four apartments.</span> <span id="s492">And that we accumulated down payment.</span> <span id="s493">You know, once you make a down payment, that will pay itself.</span> <span id="s494">And that’s how we accumulated some apartments.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">WH: So you wound up owning some apartments?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">LH: Wound up owning apartments.</span> <span id="s497">Yeh.</span> <span id="s498">Quite a few.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">WH: How were you able to own (inaudible)-.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">LH: Well I own sixty units in one project we bought.</span> <span id="s501">We bought 36 and we built 24, so we’ll end up with 60 units.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">WH: Was there a reason why you went to put the money there, into the real estate?</span> <span id="s503">Did you have a feeling that-?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">LH: Well, it was the easiest way for me.</span> <span id="s505">I didn’t know anything else.</span> <span id="s506">And my English wasn’t still good.</span> <span id="s507">Well, we start off having a little grocery...and he was still working.</span> <span id="s508">He was working.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">WH: Who ran the grocery then?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">LH: Me!</span></p> <p><span id="s511">WH: You were doing tailoring, alterations?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">LH: In the evening, you know, in the grocery.</span> <span id="s513">In the grocery, behind the door.</span> <span id="s514">I did a little of everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">WH: Work hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">LH: I worked as much as 18 and sometimes more hours a day.</span> <span id="s517">If I got six hours of sleep, that was a GOOD rest.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">WH: Today, your main language you speak is Yiddidsh?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">LH: Between us, we speak Yiddish.</span> <span id="s520">Speak Yiddish, speak Polish.</span> <span id="s521">Not between us because she doesn’t speak Polish, speaks Russian.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">WH: Who was the most helpful, who were the people who made the biggest impression?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">LH: The Wassermans were really a big help to us for the simple reason, they helped us to bring his brother which it was the only relative we both have.</span> <span id="s524">We didn’t have any, and this was all I had.</span> <span id="s525">And I knew that before the war.</span> <span id="s526">You see, I was engaged to be married before the war.</span> <span id="s527">With Mandel.</span> <span id="s528">And we got married in 1940, when the war broke out.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">WH: In those years, I don’t know if there were any survivors left, but were there any group pf people, like survivors that got together?</span></p> <p><span id="s530">LH: Well we had for a little while, here, in Oklahoma those few families who came, and gradually they left.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">WH: Do you still have contact with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s532">LH: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">WH: Did they leave because they said there was no Yiddishkeit here?</span></p> <p><span id="s534">LH: No.</span> <span id="s535">No.</span> <span id="s536">No.</span> <span id="s537">No.</span> <span id="s538">No.</span> <span id="s539">They couldn’t find satisfactory jobs, they wasn’t happy with the community.</span> <span id="s540">With the way people treated them.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">WH: What didn’t they like, if you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">LH: As far as I know, they couldn’t find a good paying job.</span> <span id="s543">They wouldn’t go work in the steel factory like my husband did.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">WH: They didn’t want to work that hard?</span></p> <p><span id="s545">LH: No.</span> <span id="s546">They didn’t.</span> <span id="s547">And, uh, they wasn’t happy about it, and they had a way out and they took it.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">WH: Did you talk about the Holocaust in the early years?</span></p> <p><span id="s549">LH: Yes.</span> <span id="s550">Yes.</span> <span id="s551">More than I should.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">WH: In the beginning?</span></p> <p><span id="s553">LH: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">WH: To whom?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">LH: between us, and whoever would listen.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">WH: And what was the reaction?</span></p> <p><span id="s557">LH: Some listened.</span> <span id="s558">Very intensely.</span> <span id="s559">And some didn’t care.</span> <span id="s560">But we always talked among us.</span> <span id="s561">You know, the survivors come together, this was just one subject on the table most of the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">WH: And today, too, right?</span> <span id="s563">If you come together with survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">LH: Well, not as much.</span> <span id="s565">Not as much.</span> <span id="s566">Like, when I was in Florida we have a lot of friends there from the survivors.</span> <span id="s567">And you talk, not as much about- oh, once in a while you just, to come in and once you get started you don’t know how to stop yourself.</span> <span id="s568">But other than that, we’ll try not to.</span> <span id="s569">We try to talk more, what’s going on, what’s current.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">WH: Did you ever have nightmares about what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s571">LH: I haven’t quit having them.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">WH: You still have them?</span></p> <p><span id="s573">LH: Oh!</span> <span id="s574">To this day.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">WH: How often?</span></p> <p><span id="s576">LH: Uhm.</span> <span id="s577">As often as you can tell.</span> <span id="s578">Sometimes every night.</span> <span id="s579">Sometimes not every night.</span> <span id="s580">But I dream a lot.</span> <span id="s581">He will tell you how many times he wakes me up, he yells, scream.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">WH: Did you ever talk to anybody about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">LH: Psychiatrist?</span> <span id="s584">NO!</span> <span id="s585">I don’t really care to.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">WH: You don’t believe in-.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">LH: I don’t.</span> <span id="s588">Very honest with you.</span> <span id="s589">My daughter is- and I don’t believe in all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">WH: Did she ever tell you to talk to anyone because it’s her profession?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">LH: UHH!</span> <span id="s592">She knew- she would let me talk to her if I would.</span> <span id="s593">But she had an earful of that.</span> <span id="s594">She grew up with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">WH: Did you talk to her a lot about the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">LH: Yeh, she heard it.</span> <span id="s597">You see Ruth speaks very well Yiddish.</span> <span id="s598">We spoke Yiddish.</span> <span id="s599">She didn’t for a while.</span> <span id="s600">Because when we first came here, she sort of blocked it out.</span> <span id="s601">But she spoke German.</span> <span id="s602">She didn’t speak much Yiddish.</span> <span id="s603">And when we came here, she went out to play, and those children when they were talking among them, she didn’t understand them.</span> <span id="s604">What does a three year old know.</span> <span id="s605">They picked up a handful of dirt and threw it in her face.</span> <span id="s606">She came in crying and those tears washed down the, the, the sand from her face- and there was lady who spoke German, she’s born and raised in Germany, she was one of my clients.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">WH: Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s608">LH: Yeh!</span> <span id="s609">And, she came in and she said to, to me, ‘whooter dis a dumbkoff!’</span> <span id="s610">...(they feshstace der garnished!</span> <span id="s611">-Yiddish_ They don’t understand it!</span> <span id="s612">Not that she doesn’t understand it.</span> <span id="s613">THEY don’t understand it.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">WH: Well, did your daughter ever feel in any way special, that she was the child of survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">LH: No!</span> <span id="s616">She felt reject.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">WH: Rejected by whom?</span> <span id="s618">By the other people because she wasn’t born here and she didn’t have much of an accent, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s619">LH: No.</span> <span id="s620">She doesn’t have any accent.</span> <span id="s621">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">WH: But, because they knew that she was a survivor, you feel they looked down on her?</span></p> <p><span id="s623">LH: Yes.</span> <span id="s624">The Jewish people, in the Jewish community, would you believe that?</span></p> <p><span id="s625">WH: How do you know that?</span></p> <p><span id="s626">LH: I know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">WH: In what way did you see it?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">LH: The way they treated her.</span> <span id="s629">She came home many times crying.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">WH: Crying?</span> <span id="s631">Why?</span> <span id="s632">What did they say to her?</span> <span id="s633">Did they call her names?</span></p> <p><span id="s634">LH: (sighs) Well,, (short sigh) not so much names, not so much names.</span> <span id="s635">It’s ah, the treatment- the cold shoulder.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">WH: You mean they didn’t invite her to their home, or something like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s637">LH: (inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s638">WH: When you said you had nightmares, do you have it more now than you did twenty years ago?</span></p> <p><span id="s639">LH: Not more.</span> <span id="s640">Just a, a, a broader variety.</span> <span id="s641">But I always have from this.</span> <span id="s642">All, all through the years.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">WH: You know you’re not alone.</span> <span id="s644">You know that most survivors do.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">LH: Oh, of course.</span> <span id="s646">Of course.</span> <span id="s647">But some people don’t- I’m just a dreamer, it appears to be, because at night I don’t sleep a night through like most people.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">WH: You wake up in the middle of the night?</span></p> <p><span id="s649">LH: Oh, many times.</span> <span id="s650">Sometimes I’ll wake and come in here and sit in the chair just to get away from the dreams.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">WH: But when you lived in Poland before the war, this didn’t happen, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s652">LH: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">WH: You slept through the night.</span> <span id="s654">- You suffered a tremendous amount during the war.</span> <span id="s655">You were in a number of camps- You were in Auschwitz- what were you doing there?</span> <span id="s656">In what part of the camp were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s657">LH: Well we went to work, we passed the crematoriums, there was the railroad coming through.</span> <span id="s658">On one side was the crematorium.</span> <span id="s659">And when we passed to work in the morning, we cut those long, thin (she tries to recall the name of the plant that they had to cut).</span> <span id="s660">She says in Polish, ‘kinyas?’)</span> <span id="s661">...</span></p> <p><span id="s662">WH: This was work you did in the field?</span></p> <p><span id="s663">LH: Ya, ya.</span> <span id="s664">And we saw the transport what where they came from Hungary, from, they are there from Poland, probably, no, from Poland and there was nothing left then.</span> <span id="s665">Had to be from Hungary, and Belgium and those kind of places.</span> <span id="s666">You saw little shoes, and toys scattered across the railroad.</span> <span id="s667">Used to brought in the people straight from the, ah, from the train.</span> <span id="s668">The cattle trains...</span></p> <p><span id="s669">WH: It was called the ‘umphshlackpatz (German?)’</span> <span id="s670">where they met, where they gathered them.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">LH: Ya.</span> <span id="s672">Killed them.</span> <span id="s673">They killed them.</span> <span id="s674">They gassed them.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">WH: How come they gassed them rather than-.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">LH: You could smell the flesh burning.</span> <span id="s677">I worked on the crematoriums later when they start bur- when they stop burning them.</span> <span id="s678">We took them apart.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">WH: Took what apart?</span></p> <p><span id="s680">LH: They crematoriums.</span> <span id="s681">As many as they could, ehrrr-.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">WH: To erase the evidence, you mean.</span> <span id="s683">How come when they came-.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">LH: Because I was the last one- we were the last party to leave.</span> <span id="s685">The last party to leave Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">WH: A lot of the people who went to Auschwitz didn’t make it, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s687">LH: Oh!</span> <span id="s688">My brother!</span> <span id="s689">I had one of my brothers.</span> <span id="s690">One of my twin brothers was in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s691">He got there earlier than I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">WH: If you had to explain why you were able to make it through, what would you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s693">LH: They just didn’t get to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">WH: You were lucky?</span></p> <p><span id="s695">LH: Ya.</span> <span id="s696">Just as simple.</span> <span id="s697">They didn’t- they didn’t get to kill them all!</span></p> <p><span id="s698">WH: You were there for how long?</span> <span id="s699">A year?</span></p> <p><span id="s700">LH: More than a year?</span></p> <p><span id="s701">WH: And yet, some people didn’t last a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">LH: Oh, no!</span> <span id="s703">Some people just didn’t even go to the barracks.</span> <span id="s704">They, they, just killed them where they stay.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">WH: Did you see a difference between the people who came from Hungary and the ones who came from Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s706">LH: Not from the survivors, I didn’t.</span> <span id="s707">The ones who didn’t survive, I didn’t get to see because they go straight in the-and we was in a big, big room.</span> <span id="s708">Mengele came in that room.</span> <span id="s709">We were naked.</span> <span id="s710">Stark naked.</span> <span id="s711">.</span> <span id="s712">And he just parade around.</span> <span id="s713">Back and forth (inaudible word) and he passed my side, you know, and you know, you are naked.</span> <span id="s714">You’re not used to it.</span> <span id="s715">And I sort of tried to hide myself a little bit or something.</span> <span id="s716">He took that whip and- switch!</span> <span id="s717">All through my back I had a ‘sweep’ from his whip.</span> <span id="s718">You know, I tried just to cover up myself because my hands, or something.</span> <span id="s719">And I guess I was as always outstanding to the Germans because I had a flaming red head of hair.</span> <span id="s720">Anyway,-.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">WH: In some way you would say that you were lucky, but-.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">LH: In some way I was lucky, because I had several incidence which I begged, even in the small ghetto... and the Germans came in they said they picked out the, uhh, higher educated people, like the doctors and all those people and took them supposedly, they was gonna give them a chance to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s723">But they couldn’t take anything with them but just like they are.</span> <span id="s724">And, the truck was full, and I pushed myself on the truck, and a German pulled me down.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">WH: And that truck didn’t go to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s726">LH: No.</span> <span id="s727">They- in two hours later they took them out in a little wooded area and killed them all.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">WH: Was that because they felt the highly educated people wouldn’t be able to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s729">LH: Well, they felt like they would be dangerous to them all- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s730">Really and truly, I-.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">End of Tape #1, Side A Tape #1, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Interviewer Notes: Ended the interview with Mrs. Henson after about 45 minutes so I could go back to the hotel, and I just want to comment editorially, that after the tape was turned off, Mrs. Henson told me, ‘You see, my daughter, the great psychologist that she is, but her children don’t live with her anymore cause she’s very smart, she got divorced.</span> <span id="s733">She got divorced.</span> <span id="s734">She got divorced and now she’s married to a Christian.</span> <span id="s735">And, in five, six years, I never accepted him.</span> <span id="s736">Five, six years, he’s never been in this house.</span> <span id="s737">They live in San Jose, but her first husband’s a religious fellow, I know him well, and he is a person that I respect, and that I love him, and he has the grandchildren, of course, and he lives in Chicago and he’s doing well.’</span> <span id="s738">Later on in the car, her second husband volunteered the following information: The second husband is a person who came from Russia in 1958 to Israel, then came here.</span> <span id="s739">He said that, ‘listen, everybody likes to talk about the success stories of the Holocaust survivors, and their children and everything, but it’s not always so successful.</span> <span id="s740">It may not be for a book to say this, but the fact is that sometimes- look,’ he says, ‘my daughter, she’s like a daughter to me, but,’ he says, ‘she had a breakdown.</span> <span id="s741">She had a nervous breakdown after she was married to the first husband, seven.</span> <span id="s742">Eight years.</span> <span id="s743">And they were married for ten years, rather, and then she married this Christian fellow.</span> <span id="s744">He goes to church, and who knows where she goes, and she doesn’t do anything now.</span> <span id="s745">Maybe she does a little part-time counseling, and everything.</span> <span id="s746">But why did she have this breakdown?</span> <span id="s747">She had this nervous breakdown.</span> <span id="s748">Why?</span> <span id="s749">Because her husband also- not her husband, but her father, who’s my wife’s first husband, HE had a breakdown.</span> <span id="s750">Why?</span> <span id="s751">Because of the war.</span> <span id="s752">Cause after the war, he was never the same.</span> <span id="s753">That’s what she said.</span> <span id="s754">So he also had a breakdown, so I think that this comes from her.</span> <span id="s755">This is also part of the Holocaust story.</span> <span id="s756">That these things happen to people.</span> <span id="s757">And that the children sometimes have problems.</span> <span id="s758">I’m not sure, but this could be the answer.</span> <span id="s759">She- we gave her money, and bought her house twice.</span> <span id="s760">The mother’s not at fault.</span> <span id="s761">It’s the daughter that’s at fault.</span> <span id="s762">That this happened.</span> <span id="s763">But, that’s the way it is.</span> <span id="s764">And, you should know that.’</span> <span id="s765">(Later on in the evening I will go back to Mrs. Henson and continue the interview)</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Continuation of Interview:</span></p> <p><span id="s767">WH: You didn’t feel anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s768">LH: No.</span> <span id="s769">Not really.</span> <span id="s770">(She asks her husband, ‘Did you ever?’</span> <span id="s771">and he says.</span> <span id="s772">‘No’).</span></p> <p><span id="s773">WH: When you think back on your life here, after everything else, what do you feel most proud about?</span></p> <p><span id="s774">LH: My independence and hard work (She looks for an article).</span></p> <p><span id="s775">WH: What you’re most proud of is that you achieved independence here, right, being your own boss.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">LH: Being self-sufficient.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">WH: Anything else?</span></p> <p><span id="s778">LH: Nothing, really, especially.</span> <span id="s779">I’m proud of my daughter, my grandchildren.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">WH: This counts too.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">LH: It does.</span> <span id="s782">To me, this is my biggest accomplishment, is those grandchildren.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">WH: Is there anything that you regret, since you came here, that if you could have done it another way, you would have dome it another way.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">LH: (heavy sigh) Ya, there are things, but I’m not gonna get into it.</span> <span id="s785">There are things, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">WH: Are you sorry that you came to Oklahoma City?</span></p> <p><span id="s787">LH: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s788">I’m sorry that I missed a lot of friendship from people I grew up with.</span> <span id="s789">Which I grew apart.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">WH: Do you think that coming here-.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">LH: It had certain advantages.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">WH: Did it force you to become an American more- more quickly?</span></p> <p><span id="s793">LH: In a way, in a way, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">WH: More than if you had stayed in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s795">LH: Yes, yes, probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">WH: I mean, if you had stayed in New York, then your friends would have been mostly other survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s797">LH: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">WH: And here, you didn’t have that opportunity.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">LH: No, I just had all kinds of fr- you know, from every walk of life I would say, because when we first start out with the apartment and I was sort of good with people, willing to listen, and so we made a lot of friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">WH: Have you been healthy, in good health your whole life?</span></p> <p><span id="s801">LH: Yes, up to the last few years.</span> <span id="s802">The last few years give us both a little trouble.</span> <span id="s803">But, up to then, I was in pretty good health.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">WH: Have you lived in this house all-?</span></p> <p><span id="s805">LH: No, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s806">We lived in the apartment.</span> <span id="s807">We lived in this house eleven years...we lived in the apartments- I had sixty units before Abby (her second husband?)</span> <span id="s808">came to the States and then we bought sixty more after he came.</span> <span id="s809">So-.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">WH: But he’s also in the oil business.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">LH: Ya, but then he wasn’t.</span> <span id="s812">This was before he got into the oil business.</span> <span id="s813">We bought the sixty when we already had the means.</span> <span id="s814">In one year...he bought one (oil) company before the apartments.</span> <span id="s815">And, then we had the chance to buy those sixty units, I knew the man who, he was in his late 80’s, and we bought it with very little money.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">WH: Do you feel that lucky people make their own luck?</span></p> <p><span id="s817">LH: Not completely.</span> <span id="s818">(inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s819">WH: I mean, you couldn’t have survived through the war without sometimes using your head, taking advantage of the-.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">LH: You had to.</span> <span id="s821">You sometimes- I did some blunders, like walking up to a German officer, begging him to send me, because they said this transport goes where my husband goes-.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">WH: (Where did you go?</span> <span id="s823">Inaudible) Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">LH: Statachovitza (?)</span> <span id="s825">...</span></p> <p><span id="s826">WH: You explained to me, but-.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">LH: No, I explained to you something else.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">WH: About the truck.</span> <span id="s829">That you got pushed off the truck.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">LH: Yes.</span> <span id="s831">That was a different story.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">WH: This was another mistake.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">LH: Ya.</span> <span id="s834">But this was when I was in Statachovitza.</span> <span id="s835">After this truck came there, when they send us to Statachovitza (?)</span> <span id="s836">and they send my husband to a different city.</span> <span id="s837">And I was in Statachovitza (?)</span> <span id="s838">and there was a same thing, a ‘select’ what we call.</span> <span id="s839">They picked out some people, and ah, I was told, through somebody that those people are going to the same fac-an ammunition factory, where I knew my husband is.</span> <span id="s840">And there was a Jewish man, a large fuhrer around there and I ask him to be friends there and he said, ‘don’t you make you dead!’</span> <span id="s841">and he got mad at me.</span> <span id="s842">‘Who am I?</span> <span id="s843">I don’t I don’t, I don’t listen very good.’</span> <span id="s844">And when they, when they, the German officer came on the grounds, and picked out the people, I walked up to him, and said it German, (needs translation) from German to English).</span> <span id="s845">(She apparently wanted to go on the transport and she was refused).</span></p> <p><span id="s846">WH: And you were lucky!</span></p> <p><span id="s847">LH: An hour later they brought their clothes!!</span> <span id="s848">(needs translation).</span></p> <p><span id="s849">WH: And when did you do something where you did have to use your head?</span></p> <p><span id="s850">LH: Shoving from one line to the other.</span> <span id="s851">And that was- I couldn’t know where they gonna send somebody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">WH: Did you feel that in many cases, only people who were tough were able to survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s853">LH: To a certain extent only.</span> <span id="s854">Because I was in a, in, in a Statachovitza(?)</span> <span id="s855">and my first husband, bless his memory, was already in, in another place, he was working there, it was a shoe factory.</span> <span id="s856">(inaudible) Poles, but the German took care of it.</span> <span id="s857">And there was rumors that they gonna turn away the people from Statachovitza(?)</span> <span id="s858">to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s859">THEN, we get in the war.</span> <span id="s860">In work that I send word to my husband, this-that’s what they gonna do.</span> <span id="s861">So what he says, he made arrangement for me to get out and come to the factory, tied up my hairs and all that.</span> <span id="s862">Where he worked, for me to get back into the ghetto, you couldn’t get in, you had no way.</span> <span id="s863">So they dressed me up as a man, and there was a hundred people working at that place, and they would count every day when they went to work, and when they got back in.</span> <span id="s864">And they dressed me up as a man, the co-workers, one man, who, his clothes fit on me, that was prepared, and brought me into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s865">And I- they came in in four of their line.</span> <span id="s866">And I was in the third fourth to get in.</span> <span id="s867">When he counted, he had one too many.</span> <span id="s868">You can imagine what a (‘gurrugcha’?)</span> <span id="s869">started out at the gate.</span> <span id="s870">‘You didn’t count good!</span> <span id="s871">You kept count!’</span> <span id="s872">The Jewish policeman, and some German officer.</span> <span id="s873">It was (the end of gurrugcha?)</span> <span id="s874">but I already disappeared.</span> <span id="s875">I was gone...(inaudible)...but they did, take the rest of the people from Kummuloffski and send them away.</span> <span id="s876">We don’t know to this day where they send them.</span> <span id="s877">And wouldn’t I get back to this town.</span> <span id="s878">I would have gone with the others.</span> <span id="s879">You see.</span> <span id="s880">It wasn’t just one time.</span> <span id="s881">So I really can’t tell you, if it’s luck (needs translation)- there wasn’t any particular.</span> <span id="s882">Because I know some knowledgeable people.</span> <span id="s883">My father was a VERY smart man.</span> <span id="s884">(needs translation).</span> <span id="s885">And he wasn’t smart because he could have gone together with a lot of people deep into Russia.</span> <span id="s886">We were packed to go and he wouldn’t let us go.</span> <span id="s887">And he wouldn’t go, because he used to say, ‘when you leave the house (needs translation bsheshona schnorer?)’</span> <span id="s888">Because we couldn’t take anything with us.</span> <span id="s889">Nothing of any value...</span></p> <p><span id="s890">WH: How did you find the strength to go on when you came here?</span></p> <p><span id="s891">LH: Hope!</span> <span id="s892">Hope.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">WH: But after everything you had been through, how could you have hope?</span></p> <p><span id="s894">LH: How could you have hope.</span> <span id="s895">If you don’t have hope, you haven’t got anything left.</span> <span id="s896">If you lose hope, you haven’t got anything left.</span> <span id="s897">If you lose hope...(inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s898">WH: You had seen how bad people can be.</span> <span id="s899">How could you have trust and comfort in some people after everything?</span></p> <p><span id="s900">LH: I had trust in myself.</span> <span id="s901">I knew if they gonna let me live, I’ll survive.</span> <span id="s902">If they not gonna kill me-.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">WH: But when you came to America, didn’t you have to?</span></p> <p><span id="s904">LH: Oh, it was very tough at the beginning.</span> <span id="s905">But, I knew, I could see, if we keep- I had a man I worked for at one time.</span> <span id="s906">.</span> <span id="s907">he said, ‘Lola, stay in the back and keep pitching’...he had an expression like that...now HE was an anti-Semite.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">WH: How do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s909">LH: Because I overheard expressions.</span> <span id="s910">He was an anti-Semite.</span> <span id="s911">(Bill Hill) the tailor.</span> <span id="s912">I don’t think he’s alive anymore.</span> <span id="s913">But, he, he, he told me then, ‘You’re gonna make something out of yourself!’</span></p> <p><span id="s914">WH: Why did he say that?</span></p> <p><span id="s915">LH: Because he thought I was ambitious enough.</span> <span id="s916">And capable.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">WH: Well, maybe that is why you survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">LH: Could be a reason.</span> <span id="s919">But I survived in, in-.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">WH: We’re not saying that luck didn’t play a role-.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">LH: No, but some of it- like my brother came to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s922">He was there several months.</span> <span id="s923">He walked to work.</span> <span id="s924">He must have had uncomfortable shoes or his feet was from perspiration, and he rubbed his heel, bad enough where they got infected, and they took him to the hospital- in Auschwitz you went to the hospital, you never came out.</span> <span id="s925">I found that out when I came to Auschwitz, I saw his friends we went to school with.</span> <span id="s926">And I talk to them, and they turned away from me.</span> <span id="s927">They wouldn’t talk to me.</span> <span id="s928">Then I knew something is wrong.</span> <span id="s929">So, I got mad at one of the- I could get a hold of him, and I say ‘You open your mouth and tell me what happened to him!’</span> <span id="s930">He turned his head and he told me.</span> <span id="s931">In, I-that’s why I said, with those shoes, is because I washed somebody’s shoes, in Statachovitza(?)</span> <span id="s932">in a camp.</span> <span id="s933">Men’s shoes.</span> <span id="s934">So they would make me a pair comfortable shoes so I can go to work- in comfortable shoes.</span> <span id="s935">It stuck in my head, that my brother, who lost his life.</span> <span id="s936">Maybe he would be alive today when I was in Auschwitz, in Statachovitza(?)</span> <span id="s937">...but I had to go to work, and I knew that if I don’t have comfortable shoes, where I can walk, then I won’t survive.</span> <span id="s938">So, the first thing I looked for is to have some good shoes.</span> <span id="s939">And that helped me, in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s940">When I came to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s941">You see, they took everything away from you.</span> <span id="s942">But they didn’t take your shoes...</span></p> <p><span id="s943">WH: Somebody wrote a book in which he said that, ‘You may think that it’s those people who grab things for themselves, who survived.’</span> <span id="s944">But he said it’s the ‘opposite’.</span> <span id="s945">He said, ‘those people who helped other people, they had people who helped them when they needed it’.</span> <span id="s946">What is your opinion?</span></p> <p><span id="s947">LH: It’s true.</span> <span id="s948">It’s true...a girl...I had helped in a small ghetto- when I came to Auschwitz...she was in the kitchen...once in a while she hid a potato in the peelings and she gave it to me.</span> <span id="s949">That potato helped me to survive...</span></p> <p><span id="s950">WH: You met kappos- Jewish kappos in the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s951">LH: Yes...</span></p> <p><span id="s952">WH: I wonder myself sometimes on how those people, they came to America, how they spent the next 40 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">LH: Well, if they were bad, people discovered them and they got out
