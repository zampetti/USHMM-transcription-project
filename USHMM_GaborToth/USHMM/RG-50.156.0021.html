from Warsaw, and my father happened to be on a business trip with my mother when I was born.</span> <span id="s14">The Jewish name was Moshe Ben Litman Gurman and my mother was Miriam Habergritz.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: And your grandparents?</span> <span id="s16">Their names and where were they born?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: I never knew them.</span> <span id="s18">The grandmother’s name was Kulik.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: So you changed your name then.</span> <span id="s20">And your great-grandparents?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: Never knew them.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: Did you know where they were born?</span> <span id="s23">Have any idea?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: I think they all came from Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: What kind of work did your parents do?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: My father was a merchant and a manufacturer.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: And your mother worked in the home?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: She was helping out my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: What kind of manufacturing work did he do?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: Military embellishments.</span> <span id="s31">Embroidery supplies.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: That would go on uniforms?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: What languages were spoken in your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: Yiddish and Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: Would you say your family was secular or religious in practice or orientation?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: Secular.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: So they weren’t Zionists, or Hasidics would you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: Zionists, yes.</span> <span id="s40">Hasidic, no.</span> <span id="s41">and I would probably have to qualify the Zionist, too, in that they were passive Zionists.</span> <span id="s42">We never contemplated moving to Palestine, but our sympathies were with the -- as they were with the majority of Jews -- were strongly Zionist.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: Did you receive any formal Jewish education?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s45">I was raised in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s46">I went to a private Jewish school within which, though the education was secular and the language was Polish, Hebrew was taught and Jewish religion was taught.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: Did you have relatives that lived in your community or outside your community?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: Well, most of them were in Warsaw or in nearby suburbs and small towns.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: From the mid-1930s to 1941, what events were you aware of, either local or national, political events, social events…</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: When the war broke out in 1939, I was 15.</span> <span id="s51">Locally I was aware that we lived in a country with strong anti-Semitic overtones.</span> <span id="s52">Internationally, I was aware of Hitler having come to power in 1933, and I grew up and went to high school in the shadow of Hitler first occupying the Rhineland and then occupying Austria and dismembering Czechoslovakia and then eventually marching into Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: How did you receive news of these events?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: There was free press in Poland.</span> <span id="s55">Newspapers and radio.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: Were these events that were going on discussed among people in the Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: How did that occur?</span> <span id="s59">Was it formally, or did they have meetings?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: I was too young.</span> <span id="s61">I have firsthand knowledge of the informal discussions.</span> <span id="s62">As far as meetings, it will be hearsay, what I think happened.</span> <span id="s63">We were not active in any Jewish organizations as such.</span> <span id="s64">We did belong to Temple, we attended the Warsaw synagogue.</span> <span id="s65">The Jews had a very active cultural life in Poland, and Warsaw was one-third Jewish.</span> <span id="s66">Warsaw, the capitol of Poland, which had 1,200,000 population, had 400,000 Jewish population.</span> <span id="s67">There were a great number of Jewish organizations, cultural activities, and there were Jewish political parties -- Zionists and Revisionists and the Bund.</span> <span id="s68">I am certain there was a great deal of awareness --Germany being next door neighbor -- of what was going on, and there was some communal activity.</span> <span id="s69">When the Germans expelled Polish Jews who lived in Germany, there was a massive assistance program to help them out, both monetarily and also in a personal involvement manner, in that people took people into their homes.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: Did you family take people in?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: No, we didn’t take anyone into our home, but my father contributed substantially to Jewish causes, both to the Jewish so-called Gemeinde, which was the Kehilla.</span> <span id="s72">It was an unenforceable type of tax, in a way, something equivalent to United Jewish Fund here, but every Jew contributed to it.</span> <span id="s73">There was sort of a very strong compulsion, I might say, to do it, because the Jews, over the centuries, lived in a form of a state within a state.</span> <span id="s74">The actual power to enforce these contributions no longer existed in twentieth century Poland, but because of historical background, it continued.</span> <span id="s75">The organization was much strong and it was quasi-voluntary, but it was really like a tax.</span> <span id="s76">A Jew who did not contribute and pay his assessment to the Kehilla would be ostracized in some way.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: Regarding that period then from the mid-1930s to ’41, you mentioned that your family was in the military insignia business, so maybe you want to talk about what, if any contacts your family had with gentiles or with the military.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: We had a lot of contact with gentiles.</span> <span id="s79">Not military as such, though my father did have some contracts for the Polish military -- some government contracts.</span> <span id="s80">The contacts with the military would be on a customer basis in that an officer would come in to buy some of these, emblems, or a cavalry man -- Poland had horse cavalry -- they would come buy spurs.</span> <span id="s81">The same thing was true of policemen.</span> <span id="s82">But that wasn’t the main class of customers.</span> <span id="s83">Most of the customers were really other fabricators who would buy some of the supplies from us and then they worked on them and made the finished products.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: Outside of the business, were there any other contacts with gentiles?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: Social contacts?</span> <span id="s86">Limited.</span> <span id="s87">We really lived pretty much a segregated life.</span> <span id="s88">Most of our friends were Jewish, not Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: You mentioned that you were aware of anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s90">Maybe you’d want to discuss how that affected you, what went on regarding anti-Semitism in your country at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: For a couple of years I attended a Polish elementary school in a suburb of Warsaw.</span> <span id="s92">And it was a bitter awakening for me.</span> <span id="s93">The kids didn’t call me by my first name, Henry, they called me “Jew.”</span> <span id="s94">It was the Polish equivalent of “Jew-boy.”</span> <span id="s95">I was the only one in the class, and I was constantly being pointed out as the “Jew-boy.”</span> <span id="s96">I’m talking about third or fourth grade.</span> <span id="s97">Scholastically I was above average, and it was a sore spot with them, and they would tell me so.</span> <span id="s98">“Oh, the Jew-boy got a B or a B+ or an A-.”</span> <span id="s99">And when they saw my report card and they spotted a “C” they were really like applauding, cheering, “The Jew-boy got a low grade.”</span> <span id="s100">And I was constantly singled out for that.</span> <span id="s101">I would come home and tell my parents: “Why do they tell me, ‘You’re a Jew!</span> <span id="s102">You’re a Jew!’</span> <span id="s103">I know I am a Jew.</span> <span id="s104">Why do they keep on telling me that?”</span> <span id="s105">In my naivete I didn’t understand why, until I learned the facts of life a little later on.</span> <span id="s106">As a result I guess my parents did transfer me to a private Jewish school -- fully accredited.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: About when was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: ’34, ’35.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: About how many were enrolled in this private Jewish…</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: It was a big school.</span> <span id="s111">There was a big private elementary school.</span> <span id="s112">In Poland, the equivalent of our elementary, junior high and high school was only in two schools.</span> <span id="s113">There was an elementary school from grade one to grade seven, and then there was a high school which was really more of a combination of our high school plus junior college.</span> <span id="s114">It was a six year school which was called gymnasium.</span> <span id="s115">So there were those two types of schools and in Warsaw, there were quite a few of them -- Jewish elementary schools and Jewish gymnasium.</span> <span id="s116">And the size of the school?</span> <span id="s117">Several hundred.</span> <span id="s118">Our classes were about 30, 35 persons.</span> <span id="s119">It was not co-educational.</span> <span id="s120">Both elementary school and high school that I attended were men’s schools.</span> <span id="s121">And there were also girls’ schools.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: How did you receive news of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: On the radio.</span> <span id="s124">Warsaw was bombed on the morning of the war at 5 a.m. September 1, 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: Where were you at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: Home.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: What was the reaction of the Jewish community there in Warsaw?</span> <span id="s128">Were there meetings held?</span> <span id="s129">Did the neighbors say anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: It was a feeling of great emotional upset and fear.</span> <span id="s131">We knew that Hitler persecuted Jews.</span> <span id="s132">We knew from press accounts and radio accounts what was happening to Jews in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s133">We knew of Kristallnacht in Germany.</span> <span id="s134">And we knew of the persecution, immediate persecutions, in Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: How did you receive word of these?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: The press reported them.</span> <span id="s137">The press in Poland, I don’t know to what extent to call it free, but it was private press.</span> <span id="s138">And there were all kinds of newspapers with different political lines, different viewpoints.</span> <span id="s139">There was Polish Jewish press, and we were reading Jewish Polish newspapers.</span> <span id="s140">My father was also reading some Yiddish newspapers.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: That were published in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: Yeah, they were all Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q; Did life change economically and socially after the outbreak of war for you and your family?</span> <span id="s144">Did it get better or worse?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: It got bad immediately, because Warsaw was bombed every day.</span> <span id="s146">And immediately we heard news accounts of the Germans making tremendous strides, moving into Poland .</span> <span id="s147">We were in Warsaw only six days.</span> <span id="s148">We left either on the sixth or on the seventh day of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: What was the discussion among your family that led up to your leaving?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: We thought that the safest thing would be to go east, away from the front, because the front was approaching Warsaw.</span> <span id="s151">But we did not expect Poland to collapse as soon as it did, militarily.</span> <span id="s152">The Jewish community lived with memories of the type of war that was fought in 1914 through 1918, of a static war.</span> <span id="s153">In World War I, it took the Germans a whole year to come from what was then the German border into Warsaw, to occupy Warsaw.</span> <span id="s154">And we thought, even if the Germans are militarily successful, it would take them at least a year to come, to reach Warsaw.</span> <span id="s155">Nobody thought that it was going to be a blitzkrieg --that within a week the Germans would march into Warsaw, and within ten days Poland would collapse, except for Warsaw that fought, resisted for four weeks.</span> <span id="s156">So we thought: yes.</span> <span id="s157">The war is coming too close for comfort, and we better go for a few months and settle somewhere east of town, closer to the Russian border where the Germans are unlikely to come.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: So when you say “we,’ who are you talking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A; “We” is my immediate family.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: How many were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: There were only three of us, my father, my mother, myself.</span> <span id="s162">I had a married sister.</span> <span id="s163">They happened to have gone to the United States to visit the World Fair.</span> <span id="s164">And there was my sister-in-law…</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: Let’s talk about the married sister that went to the World Fair.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: They went to New York to see the World’s Fair.</span> <span id="s167">They were on their way back, and the war broke out.</span> <span id="s168">The ship was turned back to England.</span> <span id="s169">They never made it home.</span> <span id="s170">From England they came to the United States.</span> <span id="s171">They survived the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s172">They are alive today in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: And then you were going to talk about another relative.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: I have a sister-in-law.</span> <span id="s175">I had an older brother who died.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: How did he die?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: He died of natural causes, either T.B. or pneumonia, I’m not sure which.</span> <span id="s178">The 30’s were the pre-antibiotics era, and pneumonia was a very risky illness.</span> <span id="s179">There were many casualties.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: And the sister-in-law?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: She also left, but she left separately with some other friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: Do you know what became of her?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: Yes, she’s in Canada today.</span> <span id="s184">She survived the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s185">She was also in Russia, as we were.</span> <span id="s186">We ran into her in Russia, in the Soviet Union.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: And how about your grandparents?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: They were dead.</span> <span id="s189">I was a late child.</span> <span id="s190">When I was born, one of my grandmothers was alive, and she died when I was eight.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: What was the town you went to when you left Warsaw, do you remember that?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s193">We just traveled east toward the Russian border.</span> <span id="s194">First we traveled on the main highway towards Pinsk.</span> <span id="s195">Then we went slightly south.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: How’d you travel?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: By car.</span> <span id="s198">We had a car.</span> <span id="s199">It wasn’t our car.</span> <span id="s200">My father’s partner had a car.</span> <span id="s201">And only because we had a military contract, we got an allotment of gasoline.</span> <span id="s202">This is what enabled us to leave Warsaw; because otherwise one couldn’t get gasoline after the war broke out.</span> <span id="s203">We got an allotment of gas -- something like 20 gallons, 20 liters.</span> <span id="s204">And it got us three-quarters down the way to Pinsk.</span> <span id="s205">Pinsk was about 300 kilometers east of Warsaw, and about 100 kilometers from the Russian border.</span> <span id="s206">Somewhere before we got to Pinsk, we ran out of gas.</span> <span id="s207">We bought a horse and a cart, and we traveled southeast to avoid the main highway toward Pinsk which was being bombed by German planes.</span> <span id="s208">And this is where we learned -- by radio --that the Russians moved into Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: But you were on the cart, so you must have stopped somewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: Oh, we were staying overnight at various peasants’ homes.</span> <span id="s211">We didn’t travel through the night.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: They were hospitable?</span> <span id="s213">How did that work?</span> <span id="s214">Did you have to pay them for lodging?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: Yes, we paid for lodging.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: So, you traveled how many days?</span> <span id="s217">Did you finally stop at one place?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: Once we stayed in a small town one night.</span> <span id="s219">We stayed in some small village about two or three nights.</span> <span id="s220">We stayed with a Jewish family in a small Polish village for three nights.</span> <span id="s221">Then we stayed in another peasant’s home for about another week.</span> <span id="s222">There we learned that the Russians were in eastern Poland, though we hadn’t seen them in that village, because they just moved into the main towns.</span> <span id="s223">We went into Pinsk.</span> <span id="s224">That’s where we first saw the Russian troops.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: Pinsk was in Russia?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: Pinsk was in Poland until World War II.</span> <span id="s227">Now it is part of what the Russians call Western Byelorussia, part of the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s228">It’s eastern Poland, incorporated into the Soviet Union, 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: So how long were you in Pinsk, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: About three months, until December.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: I went to high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: And what did your Parents do?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: Nothing.</span> <span id="s235">We were waiting.</span> <span id="s236">We didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s237">We knew that the Germans were in Poland.</span> <span id="s238">From Pinsk we went to Lvov.</span> <span id="s239">Many just refer to it as Lemberg, its German name.</span> <span id="s240">It’s the principal city of Galicia.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: Which is a province or a state?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: Galicia is an Austrian term used in the Austria- Hungary Empire until World War I. Today it’s not a term that is used.</span> <span id="s243">Geographically, politically, it’s western Ukraine now.</span> <span id="s244">It’s the largest city in the western Ukraine.</span> <span id="s245">It was the third largest city in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: And why did you go there?</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: We wanted to live in a larger city than Pinsk and find our bearings.</span> <span id="s248">We didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s249">We were far from home.</span> <span id="s250">There was a substantial Jewish community in Lvov.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: How long were you there and what did you do there?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: We were in Lvov from approximately December or January of 1940 to June of 1940.</span> <span id="s253">We were so naïve.</span> <span id="s254">Jews unfortunately indulge in wishful thinking and denials of trouble.</span> <span id="s255">Believe it or not, we registered to return to Poland -- to Warsaw -- under German occupation.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: What do you mean you were registered?</span> <span id="s257">Who were you registered with?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: We registered with Russian authorities, because we are refugees.</span> <span id="s259">We were homeless.</span> <span id="s260">We were in eastern Poland, which was incorporated into the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s261">Our home was Warsaw -- the German occupation.</span> <span id="s262">And they asked, “Do you want to become a Soviet citizen, or do you want to go home?”</span> <span id="s263">And my father and mother said they want to go home.</span> <span id="s264">“We don’t want to become Polish, Soviet citizens.”</span> <span id="s265">I don’t remember now whether it was even offered to us.</span> <span id="s266">The local inhabitants -- people who lived there --were offered, and most of them -- I guess all of them -- accepted soviet citizenship.</span> <span id="s267">We did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: What happened to those Jewish people that accepted Soviet citizenship?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: Nothing happened to them.</span> <span id="s270">They lived as they did before.</span> <span id="s271">Many of them were deported, but they were deported -- not as Jews -- in the same way that the Russians deported other people.</span> <span id="s272">They deported a lot of people, what they considered undesirables or unreliable elements.</span> <span id="s273">They would transplant people forcibly from one place to another place to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: So what happened there?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: We were registered with the Russian authorities.</span> <span id="s276">There was also a German consular office of some sort that accepted registrations, and we were registered with that office.</span> <span id="s277">“Ubersiedlung Lemburg,” which means “Repatriation_ -- to go back.</span> <span id="s278">My parents -- my mother especially -- indulged in self denial of all the problems.</span> <span id="s279">We would discuss it at home and say, “Gosh, the Germans are going to persecute us and make it very tough on us.”</span> <span id="s280">And she said, “Ah, we survived with World War I.</span> <span id="s281">They weren’t so bad.</span> <span id="s282">All these stories are exaggerated.”</span> <span id="s283">Of course it was before the Final Solution.</span> <span id="s284">Nobody knew what was coming, not at that time.</span> <span id="s285">Not in 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: So did you go back to Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: No, because the Russians, inadvertently, saved us from the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s288">I say “inadvertently,” because on June 28, 1940 an officer and a soldier came to our apartment with an official document, asked us our names, and told us we have ten minutes to pack and get going.</span> <span id="s289">And they took us to a railroad siding from which we were deported in cattle cars deep into Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: Did you have any idea where you were going when they came?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: What time of day was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: About 8 in the morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: Did you have any idea that this was going to be happening?</span> <span id="s295">Or was this a total surprise?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: It wasn’t a total surprise, because ours was not the first wave of deportations.</span> <span id="s297">Sometime in March people started disappearing.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: When you said “people?”</span> <span id="s299">what kind of people?</span> <span id="s300">Were they Jewish people?</span> <span id="s301">Or were they all kinds of people?</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: All kinds of people.</span> <span id="s303">Former policemen in the Polish state would be deported.</span> <span id="s304">Community leaders or prominent people, people who were prominent in some way in the Polish state, would be deported.</span> <span id="s305">So we knew that the Russians are in the practice of deporting people, without judicial proceedings.</span> <span id="s306">But we did not expect it.</span> <span id="s307">It came as a surprise.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: But you knew that they were in the practice of deporting people.</span> <span id="s309">So did they tell you where you were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: What was the trip like?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: It was physically and emotionally a very difficult trip, because we were in a state of shock.</span> <span id="s313">Just try to think.</span> <span id="s314">It’s unimaginable in the United States, in the political system that we live under, but just try to picture that tomorrow morning, you are home, and at 8 o’clock, two armed people walk into your house and tell you, you have ten minutes to pack.</span> <span id="s315">“Pack your belongings, you and your wife and your children, and come with us!”</span> <span id="s316">And that’s it.</span> <span id="s317">Can you imagine how you would feel?</span> <span id="s318">Well, we felt something like that.</span> <span id="s319">The first reaction really is shock.</span> <span id="s320">My mother started crying.</span> <span id="s321">She got a little hysterical, and we sort of supported each other.</span> <span id="s322">You’ve got to go, you’ve got to go.</span> <span id="s323">You don’t argue with a gun.</span> <span id="s324">Not with a gun that represents official authority of the state.</span> <span id="s325">These were not hold-up people, they were uniformed officers of the state with a list of names, and they had our names on the list.</span> <span id="s326">They read off my father’s name, my mother’s name and my name.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: Were these Polish officers?</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: No, Russians.</span> <span id="s329">There were no Polish officers any more.</span> <span id="s330">We were in the part of Poland that was incorporated into the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s331">They did not have any Polish police, unlike the Germans.</span> <span id="s332">They formed their own, very few of them from the local population, mostly transferees from the Soviet Union.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: So how long were you on the train then?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: About two weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: And then where did you wind up?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: The trip took us east of the Ural mountains, through southern Russia, traveling northeast, east of Sverdlovsk.</span> <span id="s337">After Sverdlovsk, the train turned back, and we surmised that we are destined to go to one camp, and while we were on the way, there was a change of orders.</span> <span id="s338">The other camp was overfilled, or something.</span> <span id="s339">They sent us due west, and we went west towards the city of Gorky.</span> <span id="s340">The main railroad line runs from Moscow to Sverdlovsk -- it’s really the trans-Siberian railroad line --and we ended up somewhere mid-way on that line between Moscow and the city of Sverdlovsk, about 150 kilometers north -- on a railroad spur --in a labor camp, which was approximately 30 kilometers from the nearest town.</span> <span id="s341">The name of the town was Yoshkar-Ola.</span> <span id="s342">It had a population of approximately 30,000 people, and it was the regional political administrative center of the so-called Maryskaja A.S.S.R., the Maryyskaja Autonomous Region.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: What do they mean by Autonomous Region?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: The Soviet Union consists of sixteen Soviet Republics.</span> <span id="s345">Some of the republics have, within them, certain nationalities that are unique.</span> <span id="s346">They have their own language, yet they are not big enough or not cohesive enough to form a separate republic.</span> <span id="s347">So they would form autonomous regions.</span> <span id="s348">The closest I can think of is now-a-days in India.</span> <span id="s349">There are various autonomous regions within different states, because there is a multitude of small ethnic groups.</span> <span id="s350">The Soviet Union has about 50 of those small national ethnic groups.</span> <span id="s351">There are probably one million of those people -- Maris -- that inhabit that part of the Russian Republic.</span> <span id="s352">Like Birobidjan.</span> <span id="s353">Birobidjan was a Jewish autonomous region.</span> <span id="s354">That was the Soviet answer to Israel -- to Zionist aspirations -- forming a Jewish autonomous region in eastern Siberia.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: Getting back to this deportation camp.</span> <span id="s356">What was the name of it, and what was it like?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: The name of it was Oshla.</span> <span id="s358">It was a group of approximately 300 barracks.</span> <span id="s359">They just dumped us there, off the railroad siding, and assigned us to go into those barracks.</span> <span id="s360">They were pretty bad, but when I say “bad,” it’s a relative term.</span> <span id="s361">They are bad in comparison to our present living day standards, and to our living standards before the war in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s362">I am sure that our Board of Health in any city of the United States would find them unfit for human habitation.</span> <span id="s363">But it was nothing like a German concentration camp.</span> <span id="s364">They were wooden barracks with metal stoves in them that we had to feed wood constantly.</span> <span id="s365">The minute you stopped feeding logs, it would get cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: How many people in the barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: We happened to be lucky.</span> <span id="s368">We got one room by ourselves.</span> <span id="s369">Our barrack had two large rooms and one small one.</span> <span id="s370">We were assigned to the small one.</span> <span id="s371">In the two sections of the barrack in which we were, there must have been about 15 people --five in one other room, and ten single people who were not with families in the other area.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: What kind of people were in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: We were all the same.</span> <span id="s374">That particular wave of deportation consisted all of single people and families from western Poland -- from the part of Poland that was occupied by the Germans.</span> <span id="s375">They were both Polish and they were Jewish, so it was not based on religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: You mean there were gentiles and Jewish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: I know we’ve discussed this before, but I’m trying to get a better handle on it, why people were deported from western Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: David, it was never explained to us.</span> <span id="s380">I can make at best an educated guess.</span> <span id="s381">We heard the term -- an acronym, the first letters of three words: “socially dangerous element.”</span> <span id="s382">We were deemed to be a socially dangerous element, and they would call us by the Russian equivalent of those letters, S-D-E.</span> <span id="s383">Socially Dangerous Element.</span> <span id="s384">We learned about it when we were already in the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s385">One of the N.K.V.D. agents, when he got a little high under the influence of alcohol, spilled out that term, and this is what we were.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: How many people were in the camp, would you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: About 350.</span> <span id="s388">I was in a satellite camp where there were only 50 of us.</span> <span id="s389">The main part of that camp was about five miles up the road, and there, there were 300.</span> <span id="s390">The majority of them were Jewish.</span> <span id="s391">Why?</span> <span id="s392">Because it is mostly the Jews who ran away, who didn’t want to fall into German hands, 80 or 90 would have been Jews.</span> <span id="s393">Most Poles did not leave.</span> <span id="s394">It’s the Jews that left, because they had an inkling that things aren’t going to be good under German occupation.</span> <span id="s395">So this is why, in our camp, the breakdown was typical, in that approximately 80 per cent were Jewish, 20 per cent were Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: What was daily life like in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: Very low standard of living.</span> <span id="s398">Bad food, hard work.</span> <span id="s399">We all became lumberjacks.</span> <span id="s400">They had us work in the forest felling trees, cutting them into logs.</span> <span id="s401">And the food -- all you could get is dark Russian bread of very poor quality.</span> <span id="s402">The main staple was bread, potatoes, some milk, what we could buy privately from peasants who would bring goods for sale.</span> <span id="s403">There was only one government store, which usually was out of pretty much everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: Was your schooling interrupted then/</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s406">I finished the last grade of high school but I never got my diploma.</span> <span id="s407">I was scheduled to receive my diploma on June 30th -- my high school diploma -- and we were deported on June 28th.</span> <span id="s408">I graduated college in the United States, but I’m not a high school graduate.</span> <span id="s409">(Laughs)</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: Was there any kind of Jewish life in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s412">We observed not Saturdays, but we did observe High Holy Days.</span> <span id="s413">We knew when they were coming.</span> <span id="s414">I don’t know how, because there were no Jewish calendars, but somehow the Jews knew.</span> <span id="s415">They figured out when was Rosh Hashanah, when was Yom Kippur and when was Passover.</span> <span id="s416">And we did have services.</span> <span id="s417">We did have a minyan.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: Was there a community area where they had services?</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: No.</span> <span id="s420">we knew that the Soviet Union frowned on any communal activity, and certainly prayers, so these were held in private rooms.</span> <span id="s421">I’m trying to remember now how we got out of work, and I just don’t remember, because it’s close to 40 years ago -- but I know that we did hold services.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: So everyone was expected to work, the men, the women and the children?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: Men and women were expected to work.</span> <span id="s424">Children not, I don’t think, under sixteen.</span> <span id="s425">I know that I started working.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: Who administered the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: A commandant -- NKVD commandant.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: What’s the NKVD?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: NKVD stood for Nazkarmaraderie Commissariat N (Russia.)</span> <span id="s430">Literal translation into English would be: National Committee of Internal Affairs.</span> <span id="s431">It’s an organization for which there is no equivalent in the United States.</span> <span id="s432">It’s a national internal police.</span> <span id="s433">The MVD of which we hear now is a successor to the NKVD.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: And did you or your family or any of the people you knew have any contact with the people who ran the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: We had limited contact with them.</span> <span id="s436">There were three of them.</span> <span id="s437">There was a commandant and two assistants who administered the camp of 350 people.</span> <span id="s438">It was an open camp.</span> <span id="s439">It was not a prison.</span> <span id="s440">But it was a prison for all practical purposes, in the sense that we did not have internal passports.</span> <span id="s441">And when they take away an internal passport from you in the Soviet Union, you cannot move, because anywhere you go, you’re subject to arrest if you cannot produce your internal passport.</span> <span id="s442">People are required in the Soviet Union to have their internal passport on their person at all times.</span> <span id="s443">You go into a hotel overnight when you travel, you surrender your internal passport .</span> <span id="s444">And if you don’t have one, you cannot stay, but two, the next step is almost automatic, in that the hotel clerk will call the local office of militia and say, “Hey, I have a guy here without an internal passport.’</span> <span id="s445">And you’ll be picked up shortly and you better have a good explanation why you don’t have it.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: During this time that you were in the camp, were you receiving any news about what was going on in the rest of the world, and if so, how?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: We knew what was going on in the rest of the world only through the Soviet press.</span> <span id="s448">There was a local newspaper which was very uninformative in that 90 percent of the newspaper space was devoted to achievements of local collective farms and of various enterprises, and then there was a small, small part of the paper, on the last page, about international events.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: Did you and your family speak, read Russian?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: I learned Russian.</span> <span id="s451">My parents knew it, because they lived in Russia before World War I.</span> <span id="s452">So my father spoke good Russian, my mother not so good, but she also picked it up.</span> <span id="s453">And I learned it.</span> <span id="s454">We were reading the Russian press, but we were only reading what they wanted us to know.</span> <span id="s455">I don’t remember now whether we had a radio or not.</span> <span id="s456">I don’t think we had a radio, but there was a radio -- not in the barracks – but in the settlement near where we were.</span> <span id="s457">It was not even a village, it was another settlement where there were Russian workers living, and they had radios.</span> <span id="s458">In every town and village in the Soviet Union, there is some sort of a public square where there is a loudspeaker, and the radio blares all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: Could you go there?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: Oh, we were allowed to go to that particular place, yes, because that was within walking distance, two miles or so.</span> <span id="s461">There you could go without a pass, because they knew that we are the Polacks from this camp two miles up the road.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: What did you learn through the Russian newspapers about what was going on in Germany, in Poland, with the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: We didn’t know about that.</span> <span id="s464">There was a period where Hitler and Stalin were allies.</span> <span id="s465">We knew when Hitler marched into Yugoslavia and then into Greece.</span> <span id="s466">And until May of 1941, the press reports were very pro-German.</span> <span id="s467">It was only when things had started getting hot.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: By “hot” you mean when they started to come into Russia?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: The friendship with Germany cooled when Germans marched into Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s470">The Yugoslavs revolted against their pro-German king -- expelled him -- and put on the throne his son, who concluded, as one of his first official acts, a pact of friendship with the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s471">And immediately, two days later, Germany attacked both Yugoslavia and Greece.</span> <span id="s472">When they did that, in April or May of 1941, the Russian German friendship cooled.</span> <span id="s473">It was leading up to the invasion of Russia, although the Russians still didn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s474">Maybe they knew it, but they didn’t want to believe it.</span> <span id="s475">There are historical reports that even after the war broke out, when the Germans did march into Russia on June 22, 1941, that there were no clear orders to resist -- or at least to limit counter-attacks to repel the invader, but not to cross into the German-held territory.</span> <span id="s476">Which was really academic, because the Germans made such progress.</span> <span id="s477">They were marching 100 miles a day or so in the initial stages of the war, and within two, three weeks, they occupied, probably, an area of 500 miles deep into the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s478">There was very little organized resistance in the first weeks of the war, and they took millions of prisoners of war and tremendous territories.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: Were people in your camp worried about this?</span> <span id="s480">What was going to happen with the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: Well the first reaction was favorable.</span> <span id="s482">We were all happy that the Russians are no longer allies of the Germans.</span> <span id="s483">Their attitude towards us changed.</span> <span id="s484">They freed us from those camps, because now we became allies.</span> <span id="s485">We were, in some way, enemy aliens until that time, but we were ex-Polish citizens, with whom the Germany fought a war, and from whom they took one-half of Poland, and incorporated it into their own land.</span> <span id="s486">So when the former allies had a falling out, the enemy of Germany became their ally.</span> <span id="s487">The whole attitude, political orientation, of the Soviet Union, changed.</span> <span id="s488">Overnight the British became good guys and the Americans became good guys, and the French became good guys, and the Germans became bad guys.</span> <span id="s489">And we, as ex-Polish citizens with a Polish government-in-exile in London, became semi- good guys, not quite good guys yet, but better guys than we were before.</span> <span id="s490">So the initial feeling among inhabitants of the camp was one of exaltation.</span> <span id="s491">And we were also hoping that the Russians would defeat the Germans, and that we would somehow, through some miracle, be able to go home.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: So they freed you from the camp when they went to war?</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: They freed us from the camp about a month later.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: So where’d you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: We went to that town, Yoshkar-Ola, about 30 kilometers from where we were, Some people went further southeast.</span> <span id="s496">The area where we lived was like Minnesota -- the climate was somewhat similar -- so the first impulse of all the Jews (laughter) in that part of Russia was, “Let’s go south.</span> <span id="s497">Let’s go where the climate is warm.”</span> <span id="s498">And many of them actually went to central Asia -- to the Tashkent area, to Kazakhstan, to the Soviet Central Asian Republics.</span> <span id="s499">We chose to stay, and we stayed there for a couple of years.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: What did you do there for two years?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: My father got a job and I got some sort of a job.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: Doing what kind of work?</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: I was working in a company, a commercial cooperative that manufactured some strange things, metal sheets, sheet metal work, metal fabricating, and parts for skis.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: Skis?</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: Just parts for skis.</span> <span id="s506">On a ski stick, on the bottom, the ski sticks have round pieces like a circle with leather straps, or imitation leather straps.</span> <span id="s507">We were making those circles.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: Well if I may interject an editorial comment, certainly with this war going on, the Russians weren’t gearing up for the tourist industry.</span> <span id="s509">This must have been skis for the military.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: So you were there two years and you were working there.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: I was there for two years, from ’41 through ’43.</span> <span id="s513">In ’43 I volunteered.</span> <span id="s514">I joined the Polish Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: The Polish Army!</span> <span id="s516">Tell me about the Polish Army, because in ’43 Poland was under control of the Nazis wasn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: Yes, but they deported so many people that there were enough of us to form a Polish army.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: In the Soviet Union.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: They organized two Polish armies.</span> <span id="s520">First they formed a Polish army, the one which Manachem Begin joined.</span> <span id="s521">That Polish Army moved out of the Soviet Union into Palestine at the time.</span> <span id="s522">In 1941, the Soviet Union had signed a pact of friendship with the Polish government-in-exile in London.</span> <span id="s523">As part of that friendship agreement, the Polish government organized several divisions of Polish troops from among deportees -- Polish deportees -- in the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s524">Subsequently, the Polish government-in-exile and the Soviet government had a falling-out over the so-called massacre of Polish soldiers in the Katyn forest, and those Polish divisions, which were being trained for fighting the Germans on the German-Russian front, instead were evacuated into Iran, and from Iran to Iraq and to Palestine.</span> <span id="s525">Then the Russians still had so many Polish deportees left under their control that they formed a second Polish army, under the command of the so-called Lublin Committee, the forerunner of the Polish Communist government.</span> <span id="s526">So you had one Polish army organized by the Polish government-in-exile in London, then you had a second Polish army organized under the auspices of the Polish Communists who resided in Moscow and who formed, eventually the Polish Communist government.</span> <span id="s527">And I joined that army.</span> <span id="s528">I was too young for the first one, but I joined the second one, the Lublin.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: How long were you in that army?</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: Two-and-a-half years.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: And where’d you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: I was in combat part of the time in eastern Ukraine.</span> <span id="s533">When the war moved forward, they sent me to an officer’s school, and I was an officer in the city of Chelm, the famous city where supposedly the Jews were very ‘dumb.”</span> <span id="s534">But it’s only a fable.</span> <span id="s535">Actually the inhabitants of Chelm were very shrewd.</span> <span id="s536">Then they sent us into combat, and we went through central Poland into Silesia.</span> <span id="s537">My outfit moved south of my home town of Warsaw.</span> <span id="s538">We went through southern Poland into eastern Germany.</span> <span id="s539">And in eastern Germany, we were close to the Allied lined, and they pulled us back.</span> <span id="s540">They didn’t trust us.</span> <span id="s541">They didn’t want us to join the American forces at the Elbe river.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: So where’d you go from there?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: We ended up in the city of either Zorah or Zagan -- one of the two.</span> <span id="s544">I don’t remember which one.</span> <span id="s545">I think we were in Zagan.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: Would this be in eastern Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: East Germany which is now a part of Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: Meanwhile, what happened with your father and mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: My parents stayed behind after I joined the Polish army, and they got permission to leave when the war was over.</span> <span id="s550">I ran into them by coincidence in the city of Lodz, which is the second largest city in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: So then what happened?</span> <span id="s552">You were in East Germany with the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: I was discharged from the Polish army upon promising to attend the University of Warsaw, because they needed technocrats.</span> <span id="s554">They needed technicians, educated people to run the industry, and they were recruiting prospective managers.</span> <span id="s555">And one of the sources that they went to was the officer corps in the army.</span> <span id="s556">Otherwise I would have had to serve five years as an officer.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: So you went to the University of Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: I didn’t go.</span> <span id="s559">I signed a commitment to attend.</span> <span id="s560">On the strength of that commitment, I was discharged from the service.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: Did you intend to go to the University?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: No, we were thinking of leaving.</span> <span id="s563">The plan was to cross into the Allied zone of Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: So did you, in fact, do that?</span> <span id="s565">Cross over?</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: Yes, yes, we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: How was that arranged?</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: I hope I won’t get anybody in trouble.</span> <span id="s569">From a friendly Soviet officer, I got a Soviet uniform, and I got some travel papers, which were falsified, to go to East Berlin.</span> <span id="s570">I traveled to East Berlin by train in Russian uniform.</span> <span id="s571">There was a Jewish home on Reichstrasse, in East Berlin.</span> <span id="s572">I went there.</span> <span id="s573">I dumped my uniform and I burned my papers.</span> <span id="s574">And I registered under a different name as a local refugee, as a German Jew from West Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: But you were in East Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: I registered my home as having been in West Germany, with the thought of getting permission to cross into West Germany.</span> <span id="s577">My parents also came to the same home in East Berlin, we all registered under the same family name, and we gave as our home, a city in West Germany.</span> <span id="s578">I can’t think of the name of that city right now.</span> <span id="s579">It was November of 1945.</span> <span id="s580">And it worked!</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: At this point, had you had any idea what had been going on during the war?</span> <span id="s582">What had gone on during the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: Oh, by that time we knew.</span> <span id="s584">Of course we knew.</span> <span id="s585">When I was in the Polish army we knew that there was an uprising in Warsaw, that the Warsaw ghetto was destroyed.</span> <span id="s586">I’ve seen Warsaw.</span> <span id="s587">I went through the area where used to be my home, after the war, and I saw the rubble!</span> <span id="s588">I saw the ruins of the ghetto in approximately June, July of 1946.</span> <span id="s589">I saw the remnants of the Warsaw synagogue, which just recently, I read, reopened.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: So you got to West Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: I got to East Berlin.</span> <span id="s592">It was before the Berlin Wall was built.</span> <span id="s593">You could go to West Berlin by subway.</span> <span id="s594">One of the Jewish organizations, of which there were several in Berlin at the time, organized repatriation of Germans and Jews into West Germany.</span> <span id="s595">And I joined one of those convoys from East Germany to West Germany.</span> <span id="s596">We traveled through eastern zone of Germany, the American sector of West Berlin, through East German territory to the town closest to the British zone, the city of Nordhausen.</span> <span id="s597">It was an overnight trip.</span> <span id="s598">Nordhausen was approximately five miles from the Soviet-British border, dividing the British zone of Germany from the Russian zone of Germany.</span> <span id="s599">And we crossed the border by foot -- the next day -- and immediately went from the British zone to the American zone, to a D.P. camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: And how long were you in the D.P. camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: We were in the D.P. camp eight months.</span> <span id="s602">Because my sister and brother-in-law were in New York, they were able to bring us over with one of the first waves of immigrants.</span> <span id="s603">We landed in New York harbor on August 30, 1946.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: You went all the way from the Soviet Union through Germany, then West Germany to the British zone, and then to the United States.</span> <span id="s605">Was it a carefully laid out plan, or did things just happen by luck or circumstances?</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: It was luck and circumstances.</span> <span id="s607">There was no master plan.</span> <span id="s608">I still don’t know why, of the 400,000 Jews in Warsaw, I survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: Do you have any idea what became of the other people that were in the Soviet camp?</span> <span id="s610">Did most of the Jewish people join the Polish army?</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: The able-bodied, many of then did.</span> <span id="s612">Many of then were eventually repatriated to Poland.</span> <span id="s613">And I would say that the majority of them stayed in Poland.</span> <span id="s614">When Poland turned anti-Semitic, about 1967, they started expelling the Jews again, or they took the jobs away from them after the Six Day War.</span> <span id="s615">Until then -- I’m guessing now -- I think many of them stayed in Poland.</span> <span id="s616">Many did the same thing that we did.</span> <span id="s617">They moved to West Germany, to camps, and some of them went to Israel, and some went to the United States.</span> <span id="s618">I probably would have gone to Israel if it weren’t for my parents’ age, and then we had the sister in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: Do you think that the Holocaust altered your feelings about non-Jews, in Europe or anywhere?</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s621">I have a general feeling of distrust towards non-Jews.</span> <span id="s622">And the distrust is based on my belief that non-Jews are very prone towards anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s623">It is easy to become an anti-Semite.</span> <span id="s624">And I somewhat will qualify it, in that it is necessary to draw a distinction between anti-Semitism and insensitivity, or lack of sensitivity.</span> <span id="s625">It is not the same thing, but frequently the results are the same.</span> <span id="s626">I think lack of sensitivity leads to a climate that may result in anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s627">The Holocaust did not start as a Holocaust.</span> <span id="s628">It started with insensitivity of the German population at large toward scapegoatism.</span> <span id="s629">Hitler started by using the Jews as a scapegoat for both the economic ills of Germany in the ‘30s and for defeat of the German armies in World War I.</span> <span id="s630">The famous “stab in the back” theory was, “We didn’t lose in battle, the Jews and the Communists stabbed us in the back.”</span> <span id="s631">And while the average German did not really believe it, he was indifferent.</span> <span id="s632">And it is the lack of sensitivity -- or indifference -- that permits the kind of conditions to develop that leads to a Holocaust.</span> <span id="s633">It doesn’t happen frequently, but it did happen in Turkey in World War I, something I wasn’t aware of till maybe the past two, three years that I learned that the Turks did the same thing to the Armenians.</span> <span id="s634">Not quite the same, but it was the closest thing to genocide on a national basis, on an ethnic basis.</span> <span id="s635">I may be digressing, but there is a feeling in me that the non-Jews are prone, through lack of sensitivity or through indifference, to allow conditions to develop which, yes, may lead to another Holocaust.</span> <span id="s636">Not necessarily the Jews.</span> <span id="s637">It could be somebody else.</span> <span id="s638">It may be politically expedient in some part of the world to pick on a weak minority to persecute, to reap political advantage by diverting the attention or ill-feelings of other population groups, by trying to blame a minority for their troubles, because this is what’s happened in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: Do you have any mementos, like photos, books, etcetera, from that period that you’d be willing to share with us?</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: Oh, I have some.</span> <span id="s641">My Polish army I.D. I have a few identity documents that we registered with the Berlin office of the Jewish Home.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: Do you think at some point you might be interested in contributing these to the JCRC-ADL Oral History Project?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: Eventually.</span> <span id="s644">I’d like to hold on to them for a few more years.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: I understand that.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: It has some sort of sentimental value, and when I am close to my departure from this world, I’d be willing to donate them.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: Have you seen any films or read any books about the Holocaust, and do you think they depict it accurately?</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: Yes, I read Nora Levin’s monumental work.</span> <span id="s649">I think the title is The Holocaust.</span> <span id="s650">And I do attend the communal affair, the annual services in commemoration of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s651">I have a high degree of awareness of what’s happened.</span> <span id="s652">I watch every show on television that depicts the Nazi era.</span> <span id="s653">I did make a presentation in a local high school, because both of my daughters graduated from high schools in St. Paul.</span> <span id="s654">We live in the eastern suburb of Woodbury.</span> <span id="s655">My oldest daughter graduated from Park High in Cottage Grove, my younger one graduated from Woodbury High School.</span> <span id="s656">Their adult education committee was interested.</span> <span id="s657">And on a couple of other occasions, I was asked to come back to Woodbury High School, and I invited Felicia Weingarten, who made a presentation, and the other time there is an insurance agent who works for one of the insurance companies, I can’t think of his name, but he is from Berlin, he is a Holocaust survivor.</span> <span id="s658">You may know him, but I can’t think of his name right now.</span> <span id="s659">He went with me once to make a presentation.</span> <span id="s660">(Ed.</span> <span id="s661">note: He is talking about Henry Oertelt.)</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q: This completes the interview with Henry Harvey by David Zarkin on May 11, 1983, in Mr. Harvey’s office in St. Paul.</span> <span id="s663">Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">PAGE</span></p> <p><span id="s665">PAGE 13</span></p> <p><span id="s666">PAGE</span></p> <p><span id="s667">PAGE 13</span></p></body></html>
