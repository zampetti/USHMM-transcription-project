house with you?)</span> <span id="s17">We lived with my parents alone.</span> <span id="s18">First we lived in the house.</span> <span id="s19">We occupied one room in the apartment there that had some more rooms, which were occupied by other families.</span> <span id="s20">When I was about seven, we moved to the apartment that we rented from the government.</span> <span id="s21">(How many rooms?)</span> <span id="s22">Two rooms and a kitchen.</span> <span id="s23">(Just you, your mother and your father?</span> <span id="s24">For the Soviet Union this was pretty good to have that privacy?)</span> <span id="s25">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">(Your grandparents also lived in Kharkov.</span> <span id="s27">You had two sets of grandparents.</span> <span id="s28">Did they have any influence on you?</span> <span id="s29">Did they help take care of you while your parents were at work?</span> <span id="s30">Your father, Leo Friedgan, was a civil engineer and your mother, Lilian Vishnetsky, was a production engineer in shop technology for a machine shop.</span> <span id="s31">Who took care of you?)</span> <span id="s32">The first year of school my grandma, Bella, was with me during the day after school.</span> <span id="s33">(Bella Vishnetsky, who was your father's mother.</span> <span id="s34">She had been an elementary school teacher?)</span> <span id="s35">She was retired by that time.</span> <span id="s36">(Did she teach you anything about the history of the family?)</span> <span id="s37">Almost nothing.</span> <span id="s38">(Do you think there was a reason for that?)</span> <span id="s39">Maybe there was.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">(Did anyone on your mother's side of the family teach you anything about family history?)</span> <span id="s41">No.</span> <span id="s42">(Anna said a little earlier that you knew that your mother's mother in World War II, during the evacuation, was a laborer and supported the family that way.</span> <span id="s43">Do you know where they were evacuated to?)</span> <span id="s44">Yes.</span> <span id="s45">They were evacuated to Tashkent.</span> <span id="s46">We still have some relatives there in Tashkent who stayed there.</span> <span id="s47">(Who are they?)</span> <span id="s48">Sisters of my grandma, and their children.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">(Would you say that there was any Jewish tradition in your family as you were being raised?</span> <span id="s50">Do you remember any Yiddish being spoken or holiday celebrations?)</span> <span id="s51">My grandpa from the side of my father, he went to synagogue, but I didn't hear anything religious from him.</span> <span id="s52">(He was able to go to the synagogue that you can remember?)</span> <span id="s53">No, I was told by my father that his father went to synagogue.</span> <span id="s54">(So your father may have had some Jewish education?)</span> <span id="s55">I believe so, but I didn't have any.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">(Did you know you were Jewish as you were growing up?)</span> <span id="s57">Yes.</span> <span id="s58">I was reminded a couple of times.</span> <span id="s59">(Tell me about that.</span> <span id="s60">At school?</span> <span id="s61">On the playground?)</span> <span id="s62">More on the playground, because at school I was one of the first students; it was difficult to remind me of that at school, but it was sometimes on the street.</span> <span id="s63">(What did they do call you a name?)</span> <span id="s64">Yes, called me names and pushed me around.</span> <span id="s65">(One at a time or more than one?)</span> <span id="s66">It depended.</span> <span id="s67">Sometimes.</span> <span id="s68">(Were you afraid?)</span> <span id="s69">It wasn't that often.</span> <span id="s70">(But while it was happening it must have been frightening?)</span> <span id="s71">It's not the best thing to have happen to you.</span> <span id="s72">(But you're smiling now, so whatever it was, you overcame it.</span> <span id="s73">Did you tell your parents about it?)</span> <span id="s74">No.</span> <span id="s75">(Why is that?)</span> <span id="s76">I believe that was the code of behavior never tell your problems to your parents.</span> <span id="s77">(Is that a Russian thing?)</span> <span id="s78">Yeah.</span> <span id="s79">I don't know how it is here, but over there, children have more separate life from their parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">(Did you have any jobs to do at home?)</span> <span id="s81">Yeah, I had some.</span> <span id="s82">Like help with the garbage, and to clean the house, things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">(Who were your friends?)</span> <span id="s84">During the school time I had a couple of friends.</span> <span id="s85">(Were they Russian children, Jewish children?)</span> <span id="s86">I had one Jewish friend and one Russian friend, like the best ones, during school.</span> <span id="s87">(To this Russian boy it didn't matter that you were Jewish?)</span> <span id="s88">Yeah.</span> <span id="s89">It didn't mean anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">(Do you feel that your family participated in any kind of Jewish community life?</span> <span id="s91">Was there any sense of Jewishness that connected outside of this family?)</span> <span id="s92">That I know of, my parents helped other families with clothes and things like that.</span> <span id="s93">(You mean poor Jewish families?)</span> <span id="s94">Who would these have been refuseniks?)</span> <span id="s95">No, just poor families.</span> <span id="s96">(So there was some sense of Jewish community?</span> <span id="s97">You knew they were Jewish.</span> <span id="s98">Why were they poor?)</span> <span id="s99">Their level of living was just lower than ours, so my parents helped the way they can.</span> <span id="s100">(So did you have a more comfortable life?)</span> <span id="s101">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">(What holidays do you remember celebrating?)</span> <span id="s103">Most of all birthdays, Victory Day - May 9.</span> <span id="s104">That was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">(Did your family seem different from nonJewish families when you were growing up?)</span> <span id="s106">The difference was I believe in the cultural level.</span> <span id="s107">It was higher than that of our neighbors.</span> <span id="s108">(For example?)</span> <span id="s109">Like they read books.</span> <span id="s110">They understand the situation in the country.</span> <span id="s111">(Did they let you hear the discussions about the situation in the country?)</span> <span id="s112">Only when I was more or less grown up.</span> <span id="s113">(So they were careful to guard their discussion from you?)</span> <span id="s114">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">(Do you remember any kind of Jewish wedding or circumcision or burial?</span> <span id="s116">Anything Jewish?)</span> <span id="s117">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">(How did being Jewish affect your thinking?)</span> <span id="s119">I believe it's more like a level of conscience, cultural level.</span> <span id="s120">(Of consciousness of being on a different cultural level?)</span> <span id="s121">Yes.</span> <span id="s122">(Would you say your parents, when they read the newspaper, could read between the lines?</span> <span id="s123">Could tell when something was being withheld?)</span> <span id="s124">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">(Did you have vacations together as a family?</span> <span id="s126">Could you travel?)</span> <span id="s127">Yes, we had vacations together.</span> <span id="s128">We went to the Black Sea, most of all.</span> <span id="s129">(To a resort?)</span> <span id="s130">Yes, to the resort.</span> <span id="s131">(What was the name of it?)</span> <span id="s132">Yalta.</span> <span id="s133">Most of all it was the small place near Yalta, because we had a place to live there.</span> <span id="s134">(A dacha?)</span> <span id="s135">No, just the company that my grandpa worked for, as I understand it, had a couple of houses there so they can rent them.</span> <span id="s136">(Which grandpa?)</span> <span id="s137">Anatoly.</span> <span id="s138">(He was the grandfather who was the head of a company that installed telephone cables.)</span> <span id="s139">Yes.</span> <span id="s140">(Those must be nice memories that you have?)</span> <span id="s141">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">(What kind of school did you go to?</span> <span id="s143">What kind of education were you getting in grade school?)</span> <span id="s144">It was the average school, average urban school, because the level of rural schools is much lower.</span> <span id="s145">I would say average urban school.</span> <span id="s146">(Did you know at an early age what you wanted to do?)</span> <span id="s147">No.</span> <span id="s148">(When did you know what you wanted to do?</span> <span id="s149">Did you get to study what you wanted to in school?)</span> <span id="s150">In school we had only one program, so there was nothing to choose from.</span> <span id="s151">I was good with mathematics, physics, in science.</span> <span id="s152">I didn't like that much literature.</span> <span id="s153">I'm a more technical person.</span> <span id="s154">(So you thought you'd do something with mathematics?)</span> <span id="s155">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">(When you wanted to go to institute, were you able to go to the one you wished to go to?)</span> <span id="s157">I talked with my father and we decided not to jump high because of the lessons of the previous generation.</span> <span id="s158">So I went to a technical institute and didn't go to a university.</span> <span id="s159">Actually I wanted to go to Moscow University but we decided not to.</span> <span id="s160">(So you went to the Kharkov Automobile Institute?)</span> <span id="s161">Yes.</span> <span id="s162">(You got your Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering?)</span> <span id="s163">Yes.</span> <span id="s164">(Was this a good education?)</span> <span id="s165">More or less.</span> <span id="s166">(And the reason you chose this and not Moscow University was because you thought you could not get in?)</span> <span id="s167">Yes.</span> <span id="s168">(And why did you think you would not get in?)</span> <span id="s169">Because when my father was at the same age and wanted to go to the university (and he was an honor student at school as I was), they didn't take his papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">(When your father would have wanted to go to university it would have been in the Fifties?)</span> <span id="s171">1952.</span> <span id="s172">(Why do you say that with that expression on your face?)</span> <span id="s173">At that moment the pressure on the Jews was the highest.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">(This was after the Doctors' Plot, the accusations Stalin made against the Kremlin doctors.</span> <span id="s175">So when you went to the Automotive Institute, did you feel any different from the students there?</span> <span id="s176">Were there a lot of other Jewish students?)</span> <span id="s177">Yeah, we had a group of Jewish students.</span> <span id="s178">(What percentage would you say were Jewish?)</span> <span id="s179">Around five percent.</span> <span id="s180">(What was the population of Kharkov at that time?</span> <span id="s181">Was the Jewish population about five percent?)</span> <span id="s182">I don't know for sure.</span> <span id="s183">And I say five percent, and that was in our specialty, because all institutes tried to keep the quota, but the percent was higher in our profession.</span> <span id="s184">(In your specialization?)</span> <span id="s185">Yes.</span> <span id="s186">(You had a higher percentage of Jews than the population?)</span> <span id="s187">Yes, and higher than average in the institute.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">(Did you join the Komsomol?)</span> <span id="s189">Yeah.</span> <span id="s190">(How old?)</span> <span id="s191">When I was at school, seventh grade.</span> <span id="s192">(Would you have been able to join the Communist party if you had wanted to?)</span> <span id="s193">I doubt it.</span> <span id="s194">I never tried, but I doubt it.</span> <span id="s195">(When you finished at the Kharkov Automobile Institute, what year was it?)</span> <span id="s196">It was 1981.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">(Did you go to work then?)</span> <span id="s198">Yes, I went to work.</span> <span id="s199">Actually I wanted to work at the same institute because at that moment I had been working for two years in a research position.</span> <span id="s200">We had some results at that moment so that my chief told me that the research that I did was a quarter of the Ph.D.</span> <span id="s201">But the head of the institute decided the other way round.</span> <span id="s202">They decided not to take me, but to take another student.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">(Then what happened?)</span> <span id="s204">I started to work at the Hoist and Crane Conveyer Company.</span> <span id="s205">(How long did you work there?)</span> <span id="s206">Until I emigrated from Russia.</span> <span id="s207">(I have here that you did get your Ph.D.?)</span> <span id="s208">Yes, it was in evening school.</span> <span id="s209">(While you were working you went to evening school the AllUkrainian Polytechnical Institute in Kharkov?)</span> <span id="s210">Yes.</span> <span id="s211">(From 1983 to 1987?)</span> <span id="s212">Yes.</span> <span id="s213">(Were you able to use the research you did?)</span> <span id="s214">No, it was in another area.</span> <span id="s215">(What area did you do your dissertation in?)</span> <span id="s216">It was about cranes.</span> <span id="s217">Stress analysis of metal structures of cranes.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">(How did you meet Anna?)</span> <span id="s219">We met at the resort, when I was a freshman at the institute.</span> <span id="s220">One of the friends that I was with studied at school with her, so he introduced us.</span> <span id="s221">(Did he want to introduce the two of you?</span> <span id="s222">Was that a plan?)</span> <span id="s223">No.</span> <span id="s224">(How long did you know each other before you decided to get married?)</span> <span id="s225">A little more than a half a year.</span> <span id="s226">(What year were you married?)</span> <span id="s227">It's twelve years now.</span> <span id="s228">(So 1979?)</span> <span id="s229">Yes.</span> <span id="s230">(Did your parents know each other?)</span> <span id="s231">They had heard of each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">(Do you remember what your wedding was like?)</span> <span id="s233">Yeah.</span> <span id="s234">(Was it done in a state wedding palace?)</span> <span id="s235">They have special rooms for that.</span> <span id="s236">(Did you have a party?)</span> <span id="s237">Yes.</span> <span id="s238">We had a party at home, and then we went to Moscow for the honeymoon.</span> <span id="s239">(Was that your first trip to Moscow?)</span> <span id="s240">Before that I was in Moscow when I was very young.</span> <span id="s241">I was there for a day.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">(So you were students together...)
