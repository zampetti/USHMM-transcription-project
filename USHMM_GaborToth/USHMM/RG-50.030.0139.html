LOWENBERG</span></p> <p><span id="s10">January 28, 1993</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: Bill, tell me your name and your place of birth and your date of birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: My name is William J. Lowenberg, Bill Lowenberg.</span> <span id="s13">I was born on August the 14th 1926 in a small town in Westphalia by the name of Ochtrup.</span> <span id="s14">It's not far from the Dutch border.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: Can you tell me just a little bit about your family, how many sisters or brothers that you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s17">My parents were born in the same vicinity within a few miles from where I was born and so were my grandparents on both sides.</span> <span id="s18">And several generations, I don't know three or four or five, maybe longer.</span> <span id="s19">I had one sister who was three years younger than I am.</span> <span id="s20">And my father's parents lived in the same house with us on the second, two story house.</span> <span id="s21">And my father had two sisters and a brother.</span> <span id="s22">One sister died in the early '30s of natural causes.</span> <span id="s23">And his brother, my father's brother, and my father, they all were in the First World War as German soldiers.</span> <span id="s24">They were German citizens.</span> <span id="s25">And my father's brother died shortly after the First World War, he was gassed in France, during when they used gas in France, so he died of complications.</span> <span id="s26">And he died in 1920 or '21.</span> <span id="s27">I don't know exactly when those years, right after the war.</span> <span id="s28">And my mother was born in a town next to us, about eight kilometers to the west.</span> <span id="s29">And she had three brothers and a sister.</span> <span id="s30">They were some early children - born in... who died in infancy.</span> <span id="s31">And my grandfather on my mother's side, he died two years before I was born.</span> <span id="s32">My grandmother lived in that town next to Ochtrup - where I was born with her two sons.</span> <span id="s33">And one son lived and was married in another city, not very far from there.</span> <span id="s34">And we left Germany in the end of '36 about.</span> <span id="s35">We went over the border to Holland --</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: Let's not go there yet.</span> <span id="s37">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: Let's get back a little bit.</span> <span id="s39">You were very young when the Nazis took over in 1933?</span> <span id="s40">A: Yah, I was six years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: Yes, do you remember any particular change in your life in terms of friends and school?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: Indeed.</span> <span id="s43">I lived on a street, I remember vividly there, were four boys who were all the same age and all in the same grade.</span> <span id="s44">At the time I lived near a boy's school and a girl's school.</span> <span id="s45">It was a Catholic community.</span> <span id="s46">Shortly after '32, about '33 or '34, they were not allowed to play with me any longer.</span> <span id="s47">I remember that.</span> <span id="s48">I also was in, I think about the second or third grade, I was not allowed to sit in the class with the rest of the students, I had to sit in the back.</span> <span id="s49">The teacher I had, the one I remember the best, he was very nice to me.</span> <span id="s50">But the principal was a Nazi, because he insisted that I was sitting, that I would sit in the back.</span> <span id="s51">I only had about one or two report cards and then I was told I would not get any more report cards.</span> <span id="s52">I remember that.</span> <span id="s53">And the other incident I remember quite well is, um, we had, we lived in a small town where there are only ten Jewish families.</span> <span id="s54">There was no professional teacher, and my mother used to teach me Hebrew, I'm talking about Hebrew.</span> <span id="s55">And so as much as my mother could taught me the primers and the prayers and the alphabets, etcetera.</span> <span id="s56">It was necessary that we went to the next town over, which was a provincial town, where they had a professional teacher and a school, and most of the Jewish children in that province area in the county came to this town on various days of the week.</span> <span id="s57">I remember we used to go there one day a week, and first myself and then my sister and cousins of ours.</span> <span id="s58">Another girl and my sister, and three of us used to go by train once a week, I think it was on Tuesday, it was the early part of the week.</span> <span id="s59">And we had to go by train which was probably about an hour and then you had to walk for a bit to go to that school which was next to the synagogue in that town.</span> <span id="s60">The town's name was Burgsteinfurt.</span> <span id="s61">And I remember one incident in particular because there are always bullies on the street.</span> <span id="s62">For some reason they knew that we were Jews.</span> <span id="s63">And one day I was attacked by a boy maybe in his early teens, 15, 14 or 15.</span> <span id="s64">And he threw a knife at me and cut my legs.</span> <span id="s65">I remember coming to school where they had bring in a nurse and they bandaid me.</span> <span id="s66">And then shortly thereafter I couldn't we couldn't go to that school anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: Were you alone when that happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: No, my sister and our friends, my sister's friend, our cousins were with me then.</span> <span id="s69">And I remember that and that's about all I remember as far as anti-Semitic attack on me physically.</span> <span id="s70">I was beaten up later on in the middle '30s in school by boys in the class.</span> <span id="s71">And then I couldn't go.</span> <span id="s72">I went once in the years -- they took me in the early days to the city swimming pool and then I was told that I could march with the class to the pool, but I couldn't be in the pool because I was a Jew.</span> <span id="s73">I happened to be the only Jew in the whole class, the whole school of 800 children.</span> <span id="s74">But I remember distinctly that it bothered me a great deal that I could not be part of my friends to go into the pool once every few weeks or once a week when the class went to the swimming outing, in the summer of course, it was an outside pool.</span> <span id="s75">But I wasn't allowed to go in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: And when they said you couldn't have a report card anymore, did that mean you didn't do any work?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: Yes, I worked.</span> <span id="s78">I was a good student.</span> <span id="s79">I remember that.</span> <span id="s80">But the principal had decided that as a Jew I was not entitled to a report card.</span> <span id="s81">So I sat in the back of the class until '36 when my parents saw that it was impossible for us to live there.</span> <span id="s82">And we had relatives in Holland and we left then.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: Do you remember discussions in your family about leaving, was it a surprise to you when you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: I don't remember the discussions.</span> <span id="s85">I remember thinking about it in depth that my father and mother thought that Holland would be safe for us because during the First World War Holland was kept neutral just like Switzerland was kept neutral even in the Second World War.</span> <span id="s86">Because the Germans needed Holland in the First War, that's where the Kaiser ended up.</span> <span id="s87">And I think my father believed that the same thing would happen again because they needed an outlet where they could escape to maybe.</span> <span id="s88">That wasn't the case because on May the 10th 1940 of course the Germans invaded Holland, and they were there early in the morning.</span> <span id="s89">We were right on the border there.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: How did you find out that you were going to Holland, who told you?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: I don't remember.</span> <span id="s92">I don't remember that.</span> <span id="s93">I know that we went late at night by car.</span> <span id="s94">We went over the border.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: And who went?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: My father, my mother, my sister, myself, and I think my grandfather.</span> <span id="s97">I'm not too sure.</span> <span id="s98">My grandmother had died, my father's mother had died in 1936.</span> <span id="s99">I remember because I was on vacation and I had to come back.</span> <span id="s100">I was with relatives in another city.</span> <span id="s101">And I don't remember if my grandfather came immediately with us or shortly thereafter.</span> <span id="s102">I think he didn't come until Kristallnacht, which is another story here.</span> <span id="s103">And he lived with us.</span> <span id="s104">My aunt, my father's sister, went to Belgium to live with her first cousins, my father's first cousins in Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: Did you take a lot of things with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: No.</span> <span id="s107">Bare essentials.</span> <span id="s108">I don't remember if we even took furniture.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: How about a toy?</span> <span id="s110">You were six or seven years old.</span> <span id="s111">No, you were ten.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: I was ten years old.</span> <span id="s113">I don't remember toys.</span> <span id="s114">Toys weren't as prevalent then as today.</span> <span id="s115">Q: Where did you go when you went to Holland?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: We went to a small town in the eastern part of Holland called Borculo.</span> <span id="s117">It had about 40 Jewish families, 40, 42 Jewish families, a very religious town, conservative.</span> <span id="s118">And it was a wonderful life for me there.</span> <span id="s119">It was the first time in my life that I was accepted among my peers.</span> <span id="s120">It was probably the best part of my life that I have ever had was from 1936, end of '36, until '40 because uh I wasn't a Jew any longer, meaning I was just one of the boys, one of the kids which I never knew before.</span> <span id="s121">And there were children my age, Jewish and non-Jewish.</span> <span id="s122">It so happened that one boy was my age and became my best friend.</span> <span id="s123">He was killed during the war with the entire family.</span> <span id="s124">But we had a wonderful life there.</span> <span id="s125">It was very difficult for my father and mother because they came with nothing.</span> <span id="s126">They had left everything behind.</span> <span id="s127">We had a house in Germany.</span> <span id="s128">We are not people of means.</span> <span id="s129">My father had a hard life and he worked hard and there wasn't an abundance of money.</span> <span id="s130">To the contrary it was a struggle.</span> <span id="s131">And not on my mother's side, they were affluent.</span> <span id="s132">But we never felt poor of course, we had a good life in the family especially.</span> <span id="s133">But in Holland it was hard for him to begin because we had to start from point zero and it worked out quite well.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: What did he do in Germany and what did he have to do in Holland?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: In Germany my father was in business with his father, in the cattle business.</span> <span id="s136">Most of the Jews in that area were in cattle.</span> <span id="s137">Most the majority were in the cattle business.</span> <span id="s138">My father learned the textile business when he was a young man.</span> <span id="s139">And when he came to Holland it wasn't possible to go in the cattle business, that would take lots of sums of money to pay and trade, so he went back in textile, which he knew.</span> <span id="s140">And first he worked very hard with a bicycle and suitcases and went from one farmer to the next for about three years.</span> <span id="s141">And my mother did the sewing.</span> <span id="s142">He sold dresses and aprons and whatever, and he came home with the measurements and my mother worked at night and during the days.</span> <span id="s143">She also had a vegetable garden and no help.</span> <span id="s144">But it was a good life.</span> <span id="s145">And then my father was able to buy a small store on the main street on this town.</span> <span id="s146">Somebody retired or died, something, a Jewish family, and the son I remember sold it to my father.</span> <span id="s147">I don't know the arrangements.</span> <span id="s148">And we lived behind the store which was a much better life for my father, he didn't have to go by bicycle every day.</span> <span id="s149">And then it developed that my father run the store.</span> <span id="s150">He went one day a week sometimes 2 days a week, to travel.</span> <span id="s151">And my mother did take a very active part in the business and did the sewing and helping in the store.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: Did you work there too?</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: I had to work after school hours.</span> <span id="s154">I had to deliver merchandise to the people that bought.</span> <span id="s155">I was the delivery boy.</span> <span id="s156">It was nice.</span> <span id="s157">And then my grandfather came.</span> <span id="s158">He was living with us then.</span> <span id="s159">And then in 1938, Kristallnacht, my grandmother came to live with us, my mother's mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: What was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: Her name was Erica Soloman.</span> <span id="s162">My mother's maiden name was Soloman.</span> <span id="s163">She survived the war.</span> <span id="s164">She went to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s165">I'm sure you'll ask me about that later, but she survived the war.</span> <span id="s166">And my uncles, her two sons, my two uncles were arrested in Germany by the local police in a small town, a very small town there.</span> <span id="s167">They were the only Jewish family there.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">They were born there.</span> <span id="s169">And they were in jail, but during the night a few neighbors took them out of jail and held up the policeman who was their friend actually, and they took 'em by bicycles over the border, and took 'em over the border to get 'em from not being taken to one of the concentration camps, wherever they were taking them in those days, probably Dachau or Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s170">And they were immediately put under house arrest in Holland by the Dutch government.</span> <span id="s171">And they lived with another cousin of ours.</span> <span id="s172">My mother uh, my grandmother rather, I think and her two sisters married in Holland and had their children.</span> <span id="s173">And then the Dutch put 'em in a camp in southern Holland, and then from there they were building Westerbork which later became the transit camp.</span> <span id="s174">They were in Westerbork from about '38, '39 on.</span> <span id="s175">They stayed there during the war and they were liberated by the British or the Canadians, I forget now.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: Bill, between '36 when you arrived in Holland and 1940 do you feel that this was -- when you started to say this was the best time of your life up until then, it was a much more normal life for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: Well, Holland is a very good country.</span> <span id="s178">It was a very good country even more so then than now.</span> <span id="s179">Things have changed in Holland too.</span> <span id="s180">But the Dutch were just wonderful to us.</span> <span id="s181">And I felt it very strongly because I came from a very severe system of antisemitism and total separation from my surrounding area, my surrounding community where I was born and where I grew up as a small boy.</span> <span id="s182">When I came to Holland I was accepted like an equal.</span> <span id="s183">I always remember that.</span> <span id="s184">The children in my class, the neighbors, that's like it should have been anyhow.</span> <span id="s185">But... So it was most revealing for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: Then what happened in 1940 when the Germans came in, did it change radically?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: No, it didn't change radically.</span> <span id="s188">It took about a year in general.</span> <span id="s189">Yah, there were, laws were made of course and we had to turn in our bicycles and there was a curfew at night for the Jews from 7:00 o'clock on.</span> <span id="s190">So not immediately, but very soon.</span> <span id="s191">Then of course we also couldn't go to school any longer, to public schools after about maybe eight, nine months to a year.</span> <span id="s192">So we went by bus to the next town over which was a large community and they had built a Jewish school.</span> <span id="s193">They took one of the schools that the city I think gave them and they made it into a Jewish day school.</span> <span id="s194">And we went by bus every morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: Were you frightened?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: Oh, sure.</span> <span id="s197">Because on the buses we had to wear a star.</span> <span id="s198">And when the Germans came on the buses, were public transportation systems, the rails were not running any longer.</span> <span id="s199">law.</span> <span id="s200">They had a bus system between all the different towns.</span> <span id="s201">And when Germans came in we had to get up and go in the back of the bus.</span> <span id="s202">And if there were too many Germans they threw the Jewish kids out of the bus, anyone with a star, they threw us out and we had to wait for the next bus.</span> <span id="s203">That happened once every other week maybe, sometimes more often.</span> <span id="s204">And then when we walked -- for instance when we got to the town where we went to school I remember it was quite a way, it was maybe 45 minutes to an hour walk, there were no buses.</span> <span id="s205">And our classmates used to come by who lived there and picked us up on their bikes, and they picked us up and took us to the school.</span> <span id="s206">And then they had to turn in their bicycles, it was the end of that transportation system.</span> <span id="s207">But it was good for me because we could continue our education, and they were good teachers, and that was the end of my education at that point.</span> <span id="s208">I had by then maybe six, seven years of elementary education from the first grade to the sixth or seventh grade, I don't remember the details.</span> <span id="s209">It's a little different in Holland than it is here.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Then at one point Jews could not be in the buses at all any longer.</span> <span id="s211">So my father thought, and because he was told that we couldn't sit at home either that we had to keep busy, and my father called some acquaintances of his and I worked on a farm.</span> <span id="s212">I had to go every morning at 6:00, go to a farm.</span> <span id="s213">I worked there in the fields as a child.</span> <span id="s214">My father had the store still, but they were told that if you don't work you will be arrested earlier.</span> <span id="s215">So my father arranged that I went to work on a farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: Anything you do on farms from milking cows to harvesting the wheat and feeding the animals.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: Were there other children like you?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: No, not on this farm.</span> <span id="s220">This was -- other children had to do it on other farms, yes.</span> <span id="s221">This age group.</span> <span id="s222">And even old people.</span> <span id="s223">This was mainly because information filters down and they said if you work they don't arrest you.</span> <span id="s224">They did anyhow.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: Did this apply to your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: No.</span> <span id="s227">My sister, no.</span> <span id="s228">She was a little too young.</span> <span id="s229">Q: Do you remember how you got your star?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: No.</span> <span id="s231">An edict came down and you had to buy them.</span> <span id="s232">I remember that you had to buy them.</span> <span id="s233">I remember that my father had to sell them because he had a textile store.</span> <span id="s234">They had a J-O-O-</span></p> <p><span id="s235">D. Jood.</span> <span id="s236">That's a Dutch name for "Jew" But you could not pin them on.</span> <span id="s237">I remember them saying that you could not pin them on with a safety pin, you had to physically sew it on to your outer garment.</span> <span id="s238">That was very very important, I remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: Did your mother make these?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s241">they were printed by the Germans or by edict of the Germans.</span> <span id="s242">No, no, you had to buy them from some whatever institution.</span> <span id="s243">And you had to sew them on of course, you had to do yourself.</span> <span id="s244">My mother did it.</span> <span id="s245">Most likely my mother.</span> <span id="s246">Excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: Were you angry that you had to wear these?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: Oh, I don't know.</span> <span id="s249">I'm sure there was an anger.</span> <span id="s250">It was an embarrassment, it was degrading.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">But there were so many things happening, one was heaped on top of the other.</span> <span id="s252">It was a systematic, well thought out, and very orchestrated move to degrade, to belittle, to destroy the minds of the people to make them powerless.</span> <span id="s253">It's not that -- it would have been simpler if they pick us up and take us to the camps, but there was a whole prelude of acts from turning in your radios to turning in your cars and your bicycles.</span> <span id="s254">We didn't have a car, we had bicycles.</span> <span id="s255">Of turning in anything valuable, even turning in furniture.</span> <span id="s256">But one could not have a radio I remember distinctly.</span> <span id="s257">And I know the bicycles because I remember I had a bicycle for a short time during that farm episode and then I know I had to turn the bicycle in, so I had to walk every morning to that farm which was about an hour's walk.</span> <span id="s258">And you did it.</span> <span id="s259">I mean very disciplined for various reasons.</span> <span id="s260">But, yah, it wasn't an anger that I remember a deep anger at this point in my life, I don't remember that.</span> <span id="s261">But I do remember "why"?</span> <span id="s262">It just was to take away, step by step, your whole humanity.</span> <span id="s263">There was a system of dehumanizing everything we knew of from sitting in the back of the bus, wearing the star, a neighbor is not allowed to talk to you and wouldn't for fear of being put in the camps or being ostracized.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Even in Germany as a child the children could not play with me.</span> <span id="s265">And I remember one episode, I was standing in front of my house and I wanted to play so badly with the boys I used to play with, and they just said, "you can't."</span> <span id="s266">And I used to cry a lot, I remember that.</span> <span id="s267">While I'm talking things come back to me.</span> <span id="s268">I used to cry.</span> <span id="s269">I felt it even harder on my mother and my father.</span> <span id="s270">See, a child has so much capacity and a lot of things a child doesn't understand, and in retrospect and I've thought about it in recent years a lot, is the anguish my parents must have gone through to see number one, their own life destroyed.</span> <span id="s271">They had fought for the same country that was doing it to them.</span> <span id="s272">My father was very popular, and my mother, in the local community, the bowling clubs and the veterans organizations.</span> <span id="s273">And then when their children their own life and their children, to me it must have been a horrible, horrible part of life for my mother to see what happened to her children.</span> <span id="s274">I mean there was no future.</span> <span id="s275">And where do you go if it goes downhill orchestrated by a government, not only by individuals.</span> <span id="s276">But they didn't give up easy, I must tell you.</span> <span id="s277">There's a thing I remember quite vividly.</span> <span id="s278">My father was very nationalistic.</span> <span id="s279">He loved what he did because he was a veteran, he was wounded, he had medals from the First World War.</span> <span id="s280">And on Veterans Day, what we call here Veterans Day, they had parades in those days just like we have here.</span> <span id="s281">And the veterans had their rifles and they put their rifles over their shoulder and they march down the main street, and I remember that my mother was laughing.</span> <span id="s282">And my father he still left to go to that parade and march in the parade, but he couldn't have a rifle, and he was a Jew.</span> <span id="s283">So he took a cane and he wasn't the only one, others did too, and they took a cane and turned the can upside down and put a flower on the top of the cane and they marched with their Christian friends, previous friends, they marched in the same parade and you could pick the Jews out because they carried a cane as a substitute for a rifle.</span> <span id="s284">In those days we didn't think much about it because that's the way it was.</span> <span id="s285">You made the best of everything.</span> <span id="s286">But when I think about it today it does make me angry obviously.</span> <span id="s287">So there were many instances like that, but us....</span></p> <p><span id="s288">01:27:30</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: What happened between you and your friends, did they all stop talking to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: All of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: All of them.</span> <span id="s293">There was no one who dared.</span> <span id="s294">It would reflect even in the school.</span> <span id="s295">It was an orchestrated way of ostracizing the Jews.</span> <span id="s296">And they didn't monkey around by saying well maybe I should or shouldn't.</span> <span id="s297">They just didn't talk.</span> <span id="s298">Actually, that's why my parents left.</span> <span id="s299">We left early because we thought we could save ourselves.</span> <span id="s300">Now, my grandmother had arranged to take the whole family out of Germany to go to Chile.</span> <span id="s301">And she bought visas for us, for herself and her two sons.</span> <span id="s302">Her daughter was married with two small children, my aunt, my mother's sister.</span> <span id="s303">And shortly before this was all going to happen, when we would leave, we found out that they were phonies.</span> <span id="s304">Someone had taken a great deal of money from my grandmother.</span> <span id="s305">She was a matronly person.</span> <span id="s306">She was very very bright.</span> <span id="s307">She had been a widow since she was in her early 50s.</span> <span id="s308">And these were phony, false, false visas.</span> <span id="s309">So there was an attempt made to get out obviously.</span> <span id="s310">But then we also lived in small towns.</span> <span id="s311">There was no communication like we have today.</span> <span id="s312">And just to give you an example how small, my grandmother's phone number was number 2.</span> <span id="s313">Number 1 was the city hall.</span> <span id="s314">She had the second phone in the town.</span> <span id="s315">So you can imagine the system of communication in those days.</span> <span id="s316">No one knew what was going on except what filtered down through the government's edicts and attacks.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: You said you wanted to talk about Kristallnacht and bringing your grandmother to Holland?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: Well, they came over the border that night and we knew it pretty fast because my grandmother came over the border for some reason.</span> <span id="s319">I don't even remember how she got there, I really don't.</span> <span id="s320">I remember my uncles come across, but we never saw them because they couldn't stay with us.</span> <span id="s321">We were not Dutch citizens, we were there on permits as aliens.</span> <span id="s322">And they let us stay there because my father did have a permit to move there in '36.</span> <span id="s323">-- but we never became, the Dutch didn't make you citizens.</span> <span id="s324">They didn't make any of the German Jews citizens.</span> <span id="s325">So I was made stateless when Germany declared the Jew status in the Nuremberg Laws.</span> <span id="s326">I don't remember what year that was, but I assume it was before we left Germany.</span> <span id="s327">I think it was in '35 maybe.</span> <span id="s328">So we lived as normal citizens.</span> <span id="s329">We didn't have to report or anything like that.</span> <span id="s330">Maybe they kept an eye on us, I don't know.</span> <span id="s331">But my uncles who came over during Kristallnacht could not stay with us because we didn't have the permission from the Dutch government to harbor even relatives, my mother's brothers.</span> <span id="s332">So they stayed with cousins who were Dutch citizens.</span> <span id="s333">They could not walk the streets.</span> <span id="s334">They were under house arrest and then they put them in a camp.</span> <span id="s335">So my uncles in essence were in camps locked up from 1938 to '45.</span> <span id="s336">They never saw outside life for those years.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: Did your father lose his store before you went to Westerbork?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: At first no, no.</span> <span id="s339">The store was open, the store was open until we were arrested to go to Westerbork.</span> <span id="s340">But he had a very difficult time getting merchandise because a lot of us was on coupons already and the quarters were very little specifically because when the quarters were established he had very little business, so they were based on previous businesses.</span> <span id="s341">But no, I remember that the store had some merchandise on the shelf when we walked out to the local school, the auditorium of the school where they assembled all the Jews that night.</span> <span id="s342">And we were picked up by the Dutch police.</span> <span id="s343">They were not Germans.</span> <span id="s344">The Dutch police picked up us because they were told to pick up the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: Were you hungry, did you have adequate food?</span> <span id="s346">A: In those days?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: After '40?</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: Yah.</span> <span id="s349">Food was not a big problem.</span> <span id="s350">We lived in a small town, farm towns, it wasn't that serious in those days.</span> <span id="s351">It became serious later I am told for all the Dutch people.</span> <span id="s352">But we didn't have that much of a problem with food until we were arrested.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: And you had Jewish friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A: I had both Jewish and non Jewish friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s356">But when you stopped being able to talk or be with your Christian friends?</span> <span id="s357">A: Well, in Holland this wasn't so.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: It wasn't so?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: No.</span> <span id="s360">It was only in Germany.</span> <span id="s361">In Holland, no the Dutch people didn't follow that.</span> <span id="s362">Q: Did you talk about what was going on after the Germans came with your friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: Yes, indeed.</span> <span id="s364">And everybody felt sorry for you, but there was nothing you could do.</span> <span id="s365">They were hard on the Dutch people too and the Christians.</span> <span id="s366">As long as they behaved and didn't do anything political they left them alone.</span> <span id="s367">There was rationing.</span> <span id="s368">There was no gasoline, etcetera.</span> <span id="s369">You couldn't buy bicycles or tires for the bicycles.</span> <span id="s370">But in the cities it was very severe, especially later part of the Occupation.</span> <span id="s371">But no, it wasn't that bad.</span> <span id="s372">We never had a shortage of food.</span> <span id="s373">We may not have had everything, but there was no shortage of food for us until we went to Westerbork.</span> <span id="s374">Just shortage of freedom.</span> <span id="s375">Excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: What about your sister.</span> <span id="s377">Were you close as she got a little bit older during those years in Holland?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: Yah, we became very close in the last years when we got older.</span> <span id="s379">She was two years younger.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">She had reddish hair and her name was Erika.</span> <span id="s381">She died in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: Can you talk about her a little bit?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: I don't know, I don't know.</span> <span id="s384">We had a very normal family life.</span> <span id="s385">And she had lots of friends like we all had.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: Did you play together?</span> <span id="s387">A: Yah.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: What did you play?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: Oh, I don't know.</span> <span id="s390">I don't remember.</span> <span id="s391">What do children do?</span> <span id="s392">We did what everybody else did.</span> <span id="s393">Q: So you didn't mind having a little girl sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s395">First of all you don't have the choice, and second of all she was my sister.</span> <span id="s396">And she was very bright.</span> <span id="s397">She was a good student, I remember.</span> <span id="s398">She went to a girls school and there were two schools, boys and girls.</span> <span id="s399">They were separated.</span> <span id="s400">And she had lots of friends, I remember that.</span> <span id="s401">And I was 14 when I saw her last, 15.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: Did you know anyone who went into hiding or did you think about going into hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: Oh, I knew quite a few people in hiding.</span> <span id="s404">I mean not a lot, but several families went into hiding.</span> <span id="s405">See, we were relatively newcomers in the town because we had only gotten there.</span> <span id="s406">You know, we weren't born there, my father wasn't born there, etcetera.</span> <span id="s407">So we knew... my father knew people, I knew that, but he wasn't -- I don't know, there weren't these connections like if you were born and raised with the same people.</span> <span id="s408">And then I think the other issue was finances.</span> <span id="s409">I mean the people were hiding people.</span> <span id="s410">Most people had to, most people, if not all, but most people had to pay, there had to be some resources.</span> <span id="s411">My father didn't have resources, but that doesn't mean that some people may have been hidden and saved who didn't have resources, it may be so, but I know the ones that went into hiding had some resources which we didn't have.</span> <span id="s412">And then the other issue was that it was well known that if you were caught, the Jew, you would be shot on sight or something very different, terrible would happen.</span> <span id="s413">Furthermore, the Christians who were hiding the Jews were treated as Jews if they were caught.</span> <span id="s414">They were taken to the camps or shot too.</span> <span id="s415">It was a heroic, heroic gesture, anyone who hid Jews.</span> <span id="s416">There was some abuses, but I don't think that's major at all.</span> <span id="s417">But the ones who hid Jews are very heroic people.</span> <span id="s418">And I knew some after the war, but we didn't have the connection in my opinion.</span> <span id="s419">And frankly no one expected that this was a matter of either life or death.</span> <span id="s420">All we knew is we were going to camps for the duration of the war period.</span> <span id="s421">And we believed it.</span> <span id="s422">Everybody believed it.</span> <span id="s423">Well, some maybe didn't, but as far as we know we believed that this was just this period of time to be in camps.</span> <span id="s424">Where?</span> <span id="s425">We didn't know.</span> <span id="s426">Later on when we got to Westerbork we knew we were going to eastern Europe.</span> <span id="s427">We know some of them were going to eastern Europe, but letters came from eastern Europe, some of them.</span> <span id="s428">We knew that Mauthausen was where the first Jews picked up in our community, were taken to Mauthausen and then we were told they died there from hard labor.</span> <span id="s429">Our rabbi, they picked off the leadership first and the younger people.</span> <span id="s430">But that hiding business, it's hard to explain because we lived in an atmosphere of terrible, terrible fear, so for all I know maybe my father tried and it didn't work.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: When were you -- not when, but tell the circumstances of your arrest with your family?</span> <span id="s432">A: Well, you were notified.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: How?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: By the local police.</span> <span id="s435">And you were given a list of what you could take.</span> <span id="s436">Q: A piece of paper came?</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: A piece of paper came.</span> <span id="s438">I don't know how it got there, but we got a piece of paper from the police I think that said you can only take this, this, and this, one suit or two suits, and two sets of underwear, and a toothbrush, and a pair of shoes, and etcetera.</span> <span id="s439">So orchestrated and without -- and the Dutch are very organized, very respectful citizens and we followed, we all followed.</span> <span id="s440">And we were told two days or three days before that we would have to be ready such and such an evening or afternoon, and we were taken.</span> <span id="s441">The local police came by, there were only one or two policemen in the whole town, and they came by and took us to the school auditorium.</span> <span id="s442">We stayed there for, I don't know how many hours, I don't remember the detail, but I know we went in this auditorium where I used to play as a child, as a student rather.</span> <span id="s443">And then we were taken by bus to the closest railroad station.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: Could you go back a little bit.</span> <span id="s445">How did you get from your house to the school?</span> <span id="s446">A: I think we walked over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: With all the Jews of the --</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: Yes, they all came there.</span> <span id="s449">And before the evening was over they were all there, whoever were arrested, several hundred.</span> <span id="s450">There were 42 Jewish families in this down.</span> <span id="s451">Some of them had already done in hiding, and a few were picked up earlier, and some got out.</span> <span id="s452">Some of the more affluent ones, families, got out before 1940.</span> <span id="s453">They went to England.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: Did you have food with you, did you take food?</span> <span id="s455">A: You took -- yes, we took food with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: And how long were you in the auditorium?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: Just for maybe five, six, seven hours, maybe not even that long, I don't remember.</span> <span id="s458">We went direct from there to Westerbork by train to the next town where the next railroad station was, and there they put us on a train with a police escort of course.</span> <span id="s459">And we had these big knapsacks, you know, what do you call them, the thing you put on your back, packs, and that's all you could carry.</span> <span id="s460">You couldn't carry a suitcase with you, it was just all in this one big backpack, it's called.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: What did it look like when you arrived there?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: In Westerbork, well you got off the train and they marched you to a barrack, an there was a processing center and registration, etcetera.</span> <span id="s463">But you kept whatever you had with you, it wasn't taken away from you.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: What was the registration like?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: I don't remember that.</span> <span id="s466">I don't remember that at all.</span> <span id="s467">But we worked there, we spent quite a while in Westerbork.</span> <span id="s468">I worked there in the metal shops.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: Doing what?</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: Anything to do with metal shops, repairing things, because I had gone to technical school in 1938 or '39, I went to a technical school.</span> <span id="s471">It's like where you learn a trade.</span> <span id="s472">So I went back into the metal shops.</span> <span id="s473">And my sister became a runner for the offices there in the camp.</span> <span id="s474">And my father worked in -- it was a farm, the camp had a farm.</span> <span id="s475">That farm was there.</span> <span id="s476">They had cows, where my uncles since they were cattle dealers, book care of the cows so that the commandant would have milk and fresh eggs, fresh chickens, and that's what they did.</span> <span id="s477">They had that farm there for the benefit of the guards and the commandant.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: Did your mother also work?</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: My mother had to go to a place where they were doing some sewing in the hospital.</span> <span id="s480">There was a hospital in the camp in Westerbork, and she worked there sewing.</span> <span id="s481">And my father worked most of the time in the kitchen, camp kitchen, because everyone had to go and pick up their food.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: You said your sister was a runner?</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: She was -- well, a messenger.</span> <span id="s484">They used messengers to take papers or whatever.</span> <span id="s485">Yes, that's what she did.</span> <span id="s486">I remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: What was the physical situation in the barrack, were you with your family or were you all in</span></p> <p><span id="s488">different barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: No, we all went together.</span> <span id="s490">Always we were together.</span> <span id="s491">But they also had a barracks for young people.</span> <span id="s492">It was civilized in comparison with what I saw later.</span> <span id="s493">And then they also had cubicles, one room, two rooms, where families could live if you were staying there like we were staying there.</span> <span id="s494">But most people came in there and stayed maybe one or two days and then every Tuesday the trains went from Westerbork to Auschwitz or Sobibor.</span> <span id="s495">But there was a caddiemy father and mother were assigned to a caddie because he worked in the kitchen so we were, what they may call at that point, permanent residents, or whatever the name, it was a different name, but at least we didn't worry in the early days of going with them on the transport.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: Did you have a card of some kind?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: Yes, I think so.</span> <span id="s498">There may have been a card, yes.</span> <span id="s499">But then we worked and you picked up your food and at least we had dinner together every night.</span> <span id="s500">Then I went separate.</span> <span id="s501">When I became -- I was under protection of my parents age-wise until I was 15, I remember.</span> <span id="s502">But when my 15th birthday was past, when I was at the end of my 15th year I was on my own, so-called.</span> <span id="s503">And then I was shipped to Auschwitz alone without my parents and my sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: When you were there, you were there for almost a full year?</span> <span id="s505">A: About eight, nine months.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: Eight, nine months.</span> <span id="s507">Did you think you were going to be deported?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: Oh, we all knew that it was eventually to happen.</span> <span id="s509">But I'm thinking by then of escape.</span> <span id="s510">You could escape from there because the military or the guards were not as severe there as we saw later.</span> <span id="s511">And I worked for a while in cutting peat, you know, peat, we cut peat and dry it.</span> <span id="s512">I worked with some teams there.</span> <span id="s513">We cut peat in the area.</span> <span id="s514">There, where Westerbork is, is known for peat moss, peat for the stoves for heating.</span> <span id="s515">So I worked there and we are out in the field.</span> <span id="s516">If one wanted to escape and you know what you were doing, you had to be disciplined I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: Do you remember thinking about it, or thinking "No, I can't do it."</span> <span id="s518">?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: No, not then.</span> <span id="s520">Because first of all I wouldn't escape without my parents.</span> <span id="s521">I mean we had this family and had to stay together.</span> <span id="s522">And when I left there my parents wanted to go with me and I said no.</span> <span id="s523">I felt very mature when I was that age as a child.</span> <span id="s524">I remember that.</span> <span id="s525">I decided that I could handle it.</span> <span id="s526">I was hoping that if I would go they could stay.</span> <span id="s527">But then a week or two</span></p> <p><span id="s528">1Correction: cadre.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">weeks later, very shortly after that, when I was in Birchenov, they came there too.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: Let's just stay with Westerbork fora little bit.</span> <span id="s531">Was there a school there, was there some kind of school?</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s533">Actually there was a whole community of life.</span> <span id="s534">What I mean by that is, yes children would go to school.</span> <span id="s535">I think my sister did go to school.</span> <span id="s536">I was already past that because I worked in the metal shops and in the fields.</span> <span id="s537">But they had, for instance they had a wonderful orchestra.</span> <span id="s538">Then they had opera and theater.</span> <span id="s539">Because there was a whole element of German Jews who had come from Berlin mostly, from the stages, intellectual community, the artists who developed in Westerbork an infrastructure of some very beautiful entertainment.</span> <span id="s540">For me it was beautiful because I came from a small town and I had never been to opera before in my life obviously.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: Do you --</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: No, but they played the typical Strauss and Mozart pieces and all of the pieces which today we take for granted.</span> <span id="s543">But they had a lot of musicians and the majority, I won't say majority, but a lot of the leadership of that element were German Jews.</span> <span id="s544">Because they also were staying there, they were the -- of the camp.</span> <span id="s545">And it was done for the Germans.</span> <span id="s546">They wanted it.</span> <span id="s547">It was also done because it saved their lives and so they would stay longer.</span> <span id="s548">And then of course the people who were in the camp could go in the evenings after the Germans had gotten their share of it.</span> <span id="s549">The ones who had no freedom in the camps, there was a camp within the camp, were Jews who were caught who were hidden.</span> <span id="s550">And when they caught them they came into the camp and they were within a camp in the camp of Sobibor.</span> <span id="s551">They had no freedom at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">They could only stay in the barracks waiting for the next transport to leave for Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s553">The irony was that they thought they were punished more.</span> <span id="s554">We all got in the same train.</span> <span id="s555">But there was again this orchestration of fear, and of total planning.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: Did you read?</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: Yes, in Westerbork you could read.</span> <span id="s558">There was -- somewhere I remember reading.</span> <span id="s559">I used to read a lot when I was a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: Were you alone or were you--</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: No, I had friends.</span> <span id="s562">I had friends, but I like to read.</span> <span id="s563">I remember when we were in Borquelo, we used to go every Friday afternoon to the public library and picked up half a dozen books, my friend and I, and we read.</span> <span id="s564">Sometimes even books I shouldn't have been reading in those days at that age.</span> <span id="s565">But we read a lot and we had good guidance because they had good librarians.</span> <span id="s566">So we traded books before we had to take them back the following week, so we did do a lot of reading.</span> <span id="s567">In the camp there were some books because the camp was started before the Germans got there.</span> <span id="s568">The camp was started in 1939 about.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: Was it clean?</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: Yes, it was clean.</span> <span id="s571">Hygiene was good.</span> <span id="s572">There wasn't any problem with hygiene that I remember.</span> <span id="s573">It was clean.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: Do you remember differences in the population, richer people, poor people?</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: Not really, not really, no.</span> <span id="s576">The difference was the ones who were caught in hiding, they were treated very badly.</span> <span id="s577">They didn't get as much food as we did for instance either.</span> <span id="s578">There was a punishment there to make us understand that there was a wrong thing they had done.</span> <span id="s579">And also probably --I think to send messages.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: Was your grandmother with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: In Westerbork, yes.</span> <span id="s582">She was with us in Westerbork.</span> <span id="s583">And she went to Theresienstadt after I had left.</span> <span id="s584">My grandfather was also with us, and he left I think, if I remember correctly, shortly before I did on the transport by himself.</span> <span id="s585">He went to Sobibor I found out in recent years looking at lists.</span> <span id="s586">Excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: When did you find out that you had to go to Auschwitz, how did you find out?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: I did not find out at all.</span> <span id="s589">I only find out I have to go on the train, and I never heard the name Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s590">I found out when the train stopped and we got out of the boxcars in Birkenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: Okay, we have just a few minutes left on the tape, so why don't we break now so they can change the tape, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: Let's talk about your arrest and going to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s595">You went alone?</span> <span id="s596">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: Can you talk about that day?</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: I don't remember the day, but I know I had to say goodbye to my parents and my sister, my uncles.</span> <span id="s599">Went in a boxcar.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: Can you describe that goodbye a little bit?</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: I don't remember.</span> <span id="s602">I don't remember.</span> <span id="s603">I know I remember we said if we survive we all go back to Botula.</span> <span id="s604">I mean that's one thing we always had agreed on.</span> <span id="s605">But obviously it was emotional.</span> <span id="s606">But I must say as a 15 year old, 16 year old it's one thing, but I think more and more about what it had to do to my mother and my father.</span> <span id="s607">It had to be absolutely the worst.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: Did you think about that then?</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: I don't think so.</span> <span id="s610">I don't think so because it was adventuresome to some extent.</span> <span id="s611">Maybe that's not a proper word, but the fear, you were under this terrible fear and now it was already several years for me, a lifetime at that point, that we lived under this.</span> <span id="s612">So I don't remember what my feelings were.</span> <span id="s613">I have no idea.</span> <span id="s614">But I think about it since I am a father and a grandfather, that it had to tear my parents apart, their hearts.</span> <span id="s615">It had to be unreal.</span> <span id="s616">I don't think what can describe that.</span> <span id="s617">That makes me sad.</span> <span id="s618">But in the boxcar it so happened that the girl I used to know, not dating, but friend, a good friend I went to school with, he was in the same boxcar.</span> <span id="s619">She was also by herself.</span> <span id="s620">And we sat together all the way from Westerbork to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s621">And that's about all I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: This may seem a strange question, but did you date when you were in Westerbork?</span> <span id="s623">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: Did you in some way have girlfriends?</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: Yes, indeed.</span> <span id="s626">The camp was -- you lived a life there, whatever that means.</span> <span id="s627">I don't know if there was a movie there, I don't remember that, but it was -- I know we were talking about the entertainment they had there.</span> <span id="s628">They had a large auditorium, I remember that.</span> <span id="s629">And evenings there were intellectual, there were lectures there.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: Did you take a date, did you take a girlfriend?</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: Yes, I did date.</span> <span id="s632">We didn't have many places to assemble or to be alone with a person, but it was just the idea of having a friend.</span> <span id="s633">Yes, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: Did that seem even more -- well, you wouldn't know by comparison, but urgent in a way to do that because life was so difficult?</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: It was urgent to the extent that you clung to each other because there was obviously a terrible loneliness in each person, and a terrible fear.</span> <span id="s636">But I do remember that the friendships in the camp in dating, that you just mentioned as dating, friendships were very very deep and very sincere.</span> <span id="s637">I didn't have anybody that I said I'm going to marry you, it wasn't even important in life to even think that, but as friendships either from before we were there or we met there and found friendships there, new friends, and you saw that among others.</span> <span id="s638">And then there were movements, there was a whole movement in the camp of Halutsim...Zionist movement who met regular.</span> <span id="s639">Who had only one dream, they all would go together to Israel and they stay together.</span> <span id="s640">They all left together too, they all went to Auschwitz or the other camps.</span> <span id="s641">So there was this Zionist movement, there was a cultural life for us to the extent, self-created, self- created.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: Were you in any particular kind of --</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: And the Zionist group, Halutsim, we called ourselves the Halutsim which is still used, but it was a youth group, yes.</span> <span id="s644">I was younger than some of those kids, but I felt very privileged to be among the bigger kids you see.</span> <span id="s645">And the girls, we call in America dating, but that dating was a little different, but the friendships and the discussions and holding hands.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: Did you have you first kiss in Westerbork?</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: I wouldn't say it was the first one, but pretty close.</span> <span id="s648">No, yes, no, I don't know how to answer that because I don't remember the details of it.</span> <span id="s649">I do remember certain things which are not important, in general it's not a matter of seriousness, it's just teenagers, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: When you say you clung to each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: Well, we were frightened.</span> <span id="s652">There was only so much our parents could do for you.</span> <span id="s653">They had their own problems, they had their own fears and heartbreak.</span> <span id="s654">So when you were with your own age group, especially girls, and I remember a few of them, we were frightened to death, and it was important that you had that emotional friendship.</span> <span id="s655">I'm not talking about sex per se, we were too young for that, but there was certainly at the age in those days when you were 15 and 16 it was a friendship where you could hold hands and embrace each other.</span> <span id="s656">How do we know about kissing?</span> <span id="s657">Well, you kissed your parents and your sister, but not that emotion 2Possibly referring to the He-Haluts (Hebrew: "The Pioneer"),a Zionist youth group.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">that we would think of today under the modern so-called post-war society thing in this country.</span> <span id="s659">No, it was just this deep friendship and affections.</span> <span id="s660">And I think they were important.</span> <span id="s661">Of course the last time I held a girl's hand was in the boxcar for a long time because --</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q: That's this friend?</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: This friend, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: What was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: I don't remember her name.</span> <span id="s666">I know we went to the Jewish school together, I told you about, and I don't remember her name.</span> <span id="s667">I remember her face.</span> <span id="s668">But I remember the person because we were in the same boxcar.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: And you sat and you held hands?</span> <span id="s670">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: And did that help?</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: Yes, I would think so.</span> <span id="s673">I'm sure it did because it's got to help a little.</span> <span id="s674">And of course we were separated when we got out of the boxcar.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: Tell me about the trip?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: I don't remember anything about that.</span> <span id="s677">I know they opened it once for air.</span> <span id="s678">We didn't get food.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Apparently we took food I think.</span> <span id="s680">I don't remember how long it took, but I remember that someone said we are going past Berlin or the bombing building.</span> <span id="s681">And we heard bombs drop.</span> <span id="s682">That's about all I remember.</span> <span id="s683">I remember very little.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q: Do you remember noise, smells in the boxcar?</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A: Well, obviously the human, there were no toilets so whatever happened I'm sure.</span> <span id="s686">But no one died on that trip.</span> <span id="s687">Subsequent of course I have other stories to tell you.</span> <span id="s688">But on that trip no one died that I knew of in our boxcar at least.</span> <span id="s689">Maybe in others older people.</span> <span id="s690">And there's very little that I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q: There were other people your own age on that boxcar or were there a variety of people?</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: A variety, older people, younger people, babies, you name it, all of us.</span> <span id="s693">The ones who were in that camp within the camp in Westerbork, they had separate boxcars again for reasons that only the Germans will know.</span> <span id="s694">Just to have more fear than fear, create more fear than fear.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">They weren't with us.</span> <span id="s696">We never saw them.</span> <span id="s697">And them some of them, one particular family, this boy was my closest friend from the day I came to Holland until they went in hiding, he was in that group.</span> <span id="s698">They were found, they were in hiding.</span> <span id="s699">No one survived in that entire family of many people, 30, 40, 50 people.</span> <span id="s700">That entire family was hidden somewhere.</span> <span id="s701">No one survived, no one.</span> <span id="s702">So I remember he was in Westerbork.</span> <span id="s703">I saw him through the barbed wire.</span> <span id="s704">We couldn't talk to each other, just wave to each other.</span> <span id="s705">I couldn't even send him food.</span> <span id="s706">That I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: Do you remember the opening of the boxcar at Auschwitz, do you remember what kind of a day it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">02:11:40</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s710">I know it was in the late spring of '43, somewhere.</span> <span id="s711">I don't remember exactly when.</span> <span id="s712">And I remember the enormous screaming, screaming from the outside of get out, get out.</span> <span id="s713">And instructions where to put your luggage, so-called.</span> <span id="s714">We had to leave it right outside the boxcar in a big heap.</span> <span id="s715">That's all.</span> <span id="s716">You were not allowed to take anything.</span> <span id="s717">And then I remember, what I remember vividly, we were marked, the men on one side, women on the other side, and I remember standing in front of --and I know that my mother had put double shirts on me, double sweater, everything was double to make sure and I looked quite heavy and was well fed.</span> <span id="s718">And I know men were putting this stick out to me and he said "Wie alt?"</span> <span id="s719">, how old.</span> <span id="s720">And for reasons I have never been able to say, I said "achtzehn," 18.</span> <span id="s721">Now, why, I think only God helped me at that moment because one thing I always wanted to be older.</span> <span id="s722">I always wanted to be with older people, more mature people.</span> <span id="s723">So I said 18, achtzehn, and he used the stick and told me to go this aisle.</span> <span id="s724">I forget which side, I think to the left.</span> <span id="s725">And then I saw other people going to the right, and I was very almost annoyed with myself that I had lied, because if I had told the truth maybe, I thought I was almost punished because I saw the others going on the trucks and I know we had to march because I figured if they go on trucks and we have to march so I thought gee, why did I not tell the truth, I would have been able to go on trucks.</span> <span id="s726">God knows how far we have to march.</span> <span id="s727">But obviously as you all know the ones on the trucks went directly to the crematorium.</span> <span id="s728">And we went from there, we marched to, just a very short march, I'm sure, to the camp where we then were undressed --</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: Well, wait one second.</span> <span id="s730">When you were in that selection process was there a lot of noise, was there a lot of confusion, were people screaming?</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: No, I don't remember screaming.</span> <span id="s732">The only screaming I remember was from the guards and the prisoners who had to get us out of the boxcars, because it was a matter of you didn't walk, you ran.</span> <span id="s733">You had to be fast, fast, fast, schnell, schnell, schnell, heraus, heraus, heraus, schnell, schnell, schnell.</span> <span id="s734">We didn't know why.</span> <span id="s735">Today I know why, there were boxcars waiting to be unloaded.</span> <span id="s736">But it was always whatever you do, schnell, schnell, and heraus, heraus, heraus.</span> <span id="s737">That I remember.</span> <span id="s738">And we didn't have a chance, I didn't at least, have any chance to talk to those prisoners who were assigned to that command to do that work.</span> <span id="s739">And of course language was another problem.</span> <span id="s740">We were from Holland, the majority spoke Dutch, and we would speak German.</span> <span id="s741">No one spoke Yiddish.</span> <span id="s742">In Holland Yiddish was not known.</span> <span id="s743">I never knew Yiddish until I got into camp.</span> <span id="s744">So, yes, it was a rush act, schnell, schnell, schnell.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: When did you find out that this was Mengele?</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s747">Shortly after that.</span> <span id="s748">Malach-Ha-Mawies, the angel of death.</span> <span id="s749">I remember when they talked about the Malach-Ha-Mawies when we got to talk to some other prisoners.</span> <span id="s750">And I met a family friend there, which probably was my best -- that was probably my most important moment to survive.</span> <span id="s751">There were a couple of others, but when we left the Umschlagplatz where we got out of the boxcars we were taking into a barracks.</span> <span id="s752">I remember we were stark naked.</span> <span id="s753">Men only.</span> <span id="s754">And they were tattooing us.</span> <span id="s755">I remember that.</span> <span id="s756">And a boy, a man, a cousin came up to me and he recognized me.</span> <span id="s757">And he was on the first transport which had left Holland to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s758">There were only one or two alive on that transport, and these were young people.</span> <span id="s759">The first group out of Holland were young people.</span> <span id="s760">The biggest part was an orphanage of German Jewish boys and girls, but I think there was only boys that I knew, I remember.</span> <span id="s761">And they took all those boys, they went in the Jewish orphanage in Holland and they emptied that orphanage.</span> <span id="s762">They were not orphans, they were orphans in Holland, they were children that the parents had sent to Holland through some arrangement.</span> <span id="s763">And he was from Dortmund.</span> <span id="s764">His name was Hans Gelpter.</span> <span id="s765">He's still alive, thank God.</span> <span id="s766">He's a doctor, and he's now in Africa.</span> <span id="s767">And he knew me, and we knew, we had a lot of mutual friends, and he knew my family and I knew his family, only by name.</span> <span id="s768">But he knew more about my parents, there was an apparent friendship there or something or acquaintance.</span> <span id="s769">He knew my uncles.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">He had also been at Westerbork.</span> <span id="s771">And said a few things to me, what to do and what not to do, I remember that.</span> <span id="s772">But I felt that I saw someone I knew which had a calming effect.</span> <span id="s773">And he also told me that this the first -- the reason he came there, he had the freedom of the camp because he was one of the early ones.</span> <span id="s774">The end of '41 I think they took him, or very early .42.</span> <span id="s775">But for six months there had never been a transport kept alive of Jews.</span> <span id="s776">This was the first one, he told me.</span> <span id="s777">That's why he was so anxious to see who was there since he was amazed that they kept this one alive too.</span> <span id="s778">He saw all the previous ones, and they were weekly, every Tuesday they left Holland and crossed the border.</span> <span id="s779">So we talked and he said I'll come and visit you, I know where you're going to be.</span> <span id="s780">Because he worked and he was very handy, he could fix typewriters or sewing machine, he could do anything, and he still can.</span> <span id="s781">He's also a magician.</span> <span id="s782">That saved his life.</span> <span id="s783">And he was very good to me by telling me what to do and what not to do.</span> <span id="s784">And we would go to Warsaw together and also to Dachau.</span> <span id="s785">So he was my big brother, so-called.</span> <span id="s786">He was protective.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: Did he see you before you were tattooed?</span> <span id="s788">A: About that hour at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: What was that like, standing there with all those -</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: I have no idea.</span> <span id="s791">I mean the fear was so enormous that they grabbed your arm and just boom, boom, boom, boom, boom and you had a number on.</span> <span id="s792">And I don't remember, I don't remember if it hurt or if it didn't hurt.</span> <span id="s793">I have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q: Were you shaved?</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: Yes, shaved.</span> <span id="s796">We were bewildered, you know.</span> <span id="s797">I mean it's hard to describe.</span> <span id="s798">And from there we went to the barracks and we went through the sauna.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: Do you want to explain the sauna?</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A: Well, it's just a shower, and they use some chemicals for delousing, they called it, and they put it on the arms and between your legs.</span> <span id="s801">And we all looked alike at that point, we were all bald, and we got clothes.</span> <span id="s802">We were given clothing, a striped uniform with a pair of galoshes, what we called wooden shoes with canvas on top, and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: Were you given a hat?</span> <span id="s804">A: And a hat, indeed.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q: All men were given a cap?</span></p> <p><span id="s806">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s807">That seemed to be very important for whatever reason.</span> <span id="s808">Whatever, it was used for another item of "Mützen auf or Mützen ab"and you went through the gate with the music.</span> <span id="s809">I remember, the next thing I remember we got into the barracks and the way the sleeping arrangements, you know, the bunks where they pack you in, and the toilet facilities in the barracks which was just a big barrel.</span> <span id="s810">And the food distribution where they got -- you know, you got a bowl and they gave you some soup.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q: An individual bowl?</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: No, I remember in Birkenau you had to share it with two people to one and three people to one.</span> <span id="s813">Whoever could get the biggest gulp out, he got the most before he --</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q: We forgot, what is your number, can you just show your number?</span> <span id="s815">Your number is what?</span> <span id="s816">A: 145382.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: Big number.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A: I ran into somebody in France just recently on the trip we took with Army and for some reason we were talking and this man had a number very close, as close as I've ever seen, he 3German: literally, "Hats off, hats on."</span> <span id="s819">Accompanied by gesture of removing and replacing a hat.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">got there the same day from Drancy, and we were about maybe a hundred numbers apart.</span> <span id="s821">I never seen one that close.</span> <span id="s822">I've had a tough time.</span> <span id="s823">It was so heavy, the transports were coming in so fast, so many in that particular period that some of my friends have just ID cards, some card system there in Birkenau, they don't even have one on me.</span> <span id="s824">I've sent one to the Germans, it was a German place somewhere I was told, in Bavaria I think and they're still researching it.</span> <span id="s825">But they told me that there was a period of a month or two that they couldn't keep up with the administration of it.</span> <span id="s826">And they told me that yes these numbers were there, we know that, but we are at a loss, we couldn't keep up with registering the Jew numbers.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Q: Let's talk about you going in to the barrack for the first time?</span></p> <p><span id="s828">A: Wooden slab, sand floors I remember.</span> <span id="s829">The rows and rows and rows of bunks.</span> <span id="s830">And there were beatings already right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: Who beat you?</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A: The Germans, the guards, and the kapos.</span> <span id="s833">02:23:16</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Q: Could you describe?</span></p> <p><span id="s835">A: Well, the Kapos were German fellow prisoners, Christians not Jews, who were in the German prisons for anything from car theft to bank thefts to homosexuals of course, a lot of them.</span> <span id="s836">A lot of those German Kapos were homosexuals.</span> <span id="s837">And so were the barracks elderly.</span> <span id="s838">And I remember very distinctly that the barracks elderly he went and asked everybody where they were from and who could speak German.</span> <span id="s839">I was one of the very few who spoke German.</span> <span id="s840">And then he asked me where are your folks, and I told him, and he was from the same area that I was from in Germany.</span> <span id="s841">He knew the town very well.</span> <span id="s842">And since I spoke German he used to ask me every so often explain that.</span> <span id="s843">Not all Dutch spoke German in those days.</span> <span id="s844">Now, they speak more languages because of communication, etcetera and open borders.</span> <span id="s845">So he every so often used to give me a piece of bread also.</span> <span id="s846">He was a German federal prisoner.</span> <span id="s847">He was in the German Gefängnisbut he was a kapo.</span> <span id="s848">He never hit me, that one, the barracks elderly.</span> <span id="s849">The others it was different and the work teams, and so he used to take pity on me.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Because he slept separately.</span> <span id="s851">There was a section where this orderly slept with a wall around it.</span> <span id="s852">And he used to give me every so often a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s853">And then of course I saw my friend as often as we could sneak or when there was freedom a little bit.</span> <span id="s854">He could walk around the camp a little bit more than anybody else because he was there for a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">And one time he worked also in the Schreibstube, where they do all this--</span></p> <p><span id="s856">4Blockältester.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">5German: prison.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Q: Explain that.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">A: It's what they call in the Army the office part of the camp.</span> <span id="s860">He worked there for a while because he typed.</span> <span id="s861">My friend Hans was a very talented person, and still is.</span> <span id="s862">And then we went out -- working on the railroad, on the street gangs, on the street, digging in the street and repairing the street, working on the streets working near the crematorium.</span> <span id="s863">I remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q: Was that near your barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s865">A: You had to go through the gate marching, and you have to take your hats off and you have to look, you know, to the band and they counted, and it was right outside the camp where we worked on the work gangs.</span> <span id="s866">I did not go to Buna.I stayed right in Birkenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">Q: Did he help you get this job?</span></p> <p><span id="s868">A: No, no, it was just every hundred, you know.</span> <span id="s869">They count a hundred.</span> <span id="s870">And then of course the worst part was this punishment on Sundays.</span> <span id="s871">Sundays, you know, they had to check everybody that could work on Monday again, but they kept us standing outside for hours and hours and hours, six hours, eight hours.</span> <span id="s872">People dropped like flies.</span> <span id="s873">And you just didn't stand, you had to do it in a squat position with your hands out.</span> <span id="s874">Everything was done to degrade you more and punish you more.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">And after a while I was run over by a lorry and I wasn't in too good a shape, but I was managing.</span> <span id="s876">And I was hiding after that with my legs cut.</span> <span id="s877">And I was beaten a few times on my back.</span> <span id="s878">I still have some scars there.</span> <span id="s879">But my friend came to me and he says I'm going to get out of here, you go with me, there is a transport leaving.</span> <span id="s880">I don't know how long I was in Birchenov exactly, it wasn't maybe three months at the most, and it could be even shorter.</span> <span id="s881">We were in a daze, we didn't know if it was night or day.</span> <span id="s882">There was just this fear, this schnell, schnell, schnell, and no food, and the hunger and the beatings and the screamings at night.</span> <span id="s883">He says I am going on this transport unknown.</span> <span id="s884">They're putting together 300 names and you're going on it with me.</span> <span id="s885">I said whatever you say.</span> <span id="s886">What did I know, I was a kid and I trusted him because he was older and he was already seasoned, so-called.</span> <span id="s887">And he says I volunteered you, we are going on this transport now.</span> <span id="s888">He says the worst that can happen we'll get killed this week rather than next month.</span> <span id="s889">With some kind of luck we'll get out of here.</span> <span id="s890">We'll never survive here.</span> <span id="s891">There is no chance that anybody gets out of here.</span> <span id="s892">That we all knew.</span> <span id="s893">We were told that no one gets out of Auschwitz and Birkenau.</span> <span id="s894">That we know.</span> <span id="s895">It's just a matter of time how long.</span> <span id="s896">And we knew that the commanders who worked in the gas chambers were every 90 days approximately, some of them even every 30 days were killed.</span> <span id="s897">So they killed those teams that worked in the gas chambers and the crematorium.</span> <span id="s898">But they were given good food and then they didn't realize they were going to be killed in those 90 days.</span> <span id="s899">And when you got sick it was automatic 6Auschwitz III, or Buna, was a factory for the slave loabor production of synthetics under the aegis of the German corporation IG Farben.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Barracks 13, for any reason.</span> <span id="s901">And they check you ever Sunday.</span> <span id="s902">Q: What was Barracks 13?</span></p> <p><span id="s903">A: That was the last station before you went to the crematorium.</span> <span id="s904">That's where they assembled them.</span> <span id="s905">So we went into boxcars again --</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q: Wait a minute, let's not leave Auschwitz so fast.</span> <span id="s907">A: I was in a hurry to leave it.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q: I know.</span> <span id="s909">Let's go back a little bit.</span> <span id="s910">Do you remember roll call?</span> <span id="s911">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">Q: Was that different from what happened on Sunday?</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A: No.</span> <span id="s914">But Sunday lasted longer.</span> <span id="s915">During the roll call you got some tea, you know.</span> <span id="s916">Q: Do you remember how long you stood on roll call?</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A: Oh, it varied.</span> <span id="s918">Some of them were very very long.</span> <span id="s919">Some of them were very long.</span> <span id="s920">But on Sundays it was worse, and they then made you sit in a squatting position, halfway down.</span> <span id="s921">And there were a lot of beatings to scare you more.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Q: Did you try to avoid being beaten?</span></p> <p><span id="s923">A: Listen, there was no chance that you avoid that.</span> <span id="s924">I mean if they picked on you they picked on you for whatever reason.</span> <span id="s925">And they found enough reasons.</span> <span id="s926">There were always reasons.</span> <span id="s927">I was just lucky, I didn't get beaten as much as some others.</span> <span id="s928">Maybe I was shorter.</span> <span id="s929">Who knows?</span></p> <p><span id="s930">Q: When did you find out about the gas chambers?</span></p> <p><span id="s931">A: Right away.</span> <span id="s932">We knew it within a day or two, maybe even sooner.</span> <span id="s933">Not until we got there.</span> <span id="s934">The smell, the smell.</span> <span id="s935">I mean they were going, seven of them at that time and they were all around the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Q: What did it smell like?</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: Burned hair, burned flesh.</span> <span id="s938">It was -- it didn't feel normal, just the sun, the wind, you never saw birds, you never saw green.</span> <span id="s939">I mean if there would be a green leaf ten people would jump for it.</span> <span id="s940">I mean because everyone was terribly hungry.</span> <span id="s941">And so it was the smell, the stench was just awful.</span> <span id="s942">Plus the fact there was no hygiene as far as bathrooms.</span> <span id="s943">There was no such thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">There were latrines, but there was -- Q: Can you describe?</span></p> <p><span id="s945">A: In the barracks all they had was a very large wooden barrel.</span> <span id="s946">And during the night I remember, during the night to used to, whoever was in charge of the night shift, I don't know if they call them guards, but they were assigned there to stay up during the night to empty that.</span> <span id="s947">They used to wake you up with a stick, hit you over the legs or whatever and you had to jump out of your bunk and carry this thing down the street.</span> <span id="s948">I don't know far, but you can imagine a big -- it's like a big wine barrel, bigger than a 60 gallon barrel, even bigger, and you had to carry that, three people, four people, sometimes two people.</span> <span id="s949">And they had to watch, if you spilled it you got beaten up.</span> <span id="s950">If you didn't spill it you got beaten up.</span> <span id="s951">And it was so bad because some people just couldn't handle it mentally or physically, they were too weak.</span> <span id="s952">And I remember once, the first or second night in there, there were two brothers that were Dutch, they couldn't speak German.</span> <span id="s953">I remember this distinctly.</span> <span id="s954">And they beat one brother to a pulp, he couldn't carry it, so they just beat him to a pulp.</span> <span id="s955">And his other bother was watching.</span> <span id="s956">So it was one after the other, it wasn't a matter of a single issue, it was hourly.</span> <span id="s957">It never stopped, it never never stopped.</span> <span id="s958">Did it get better?</span> <span id="s959">No.</span> <span id="s960">Did it get worse?</span> <span id="s961">Yes.</span> <span id="s962">And that's why when I said we were convinced we would never get out of here.</span> <span id="s963">But then there is something about the human being that you always have hope.</span> <span id="s964">Because the ones who didn't have hope they disintegrated real fast.</span> <span id="s965">And for some reason I didn't.</span> <span id="s966">I always had hope.</span> <span id="s967">But a lot of people just --</span></p> <p><span id="s968">Q: Where do you think you got that from, where did it come from?</span> <span id="s969">A: I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">Q: Were you religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s971">A: Well, yes, I was very religious.</span> <span id="s972">We were very conservative.</span> <span id="s973">We went to Temple, to synagogue.</span> <span id="s974">We had kosher food at home.</span> <span id="s975">We fasted whenever the Jewish holidays dictated that.</span> <span id="s976">And we prayed after dinner.</span> <span id="s977">And we prayed at night when we went to bed.</span> <span id="s978">My father did not light the fire, my grandfather did.</span> <span id="s979">Not my father anymore, I learned it at bar mitzvah time.</span> <span id="s980">But most of the time I had to, for a while.</span> <span id="s981">But that doesn't mean whether or not my grandfather read the Torah on Shabbas.</span> <span id="s982">And my grandfather's brother was the , did the kosher slaughtering.</span> <span id="s983">It was a small community, this is back to Germany.</span> <span id="s984">So my father was the alternate with his cousin, president or vice president of the congregation.</span> <span id="s985">It was a small little building they had.</span> <span id="s986">So we had a very religious life.</span> <span id="s987">And in Holland even much more so.</span> <span id="s988">The town we lived in was very religious.</span> <span id="s989">We went to -- every night, Temple.</span> <span id="s990">We went most morning and on any holiday mentioned in our religion, it was an event.</span> <span id="s991">Plus we studied Gomorrah and Rashi.</span> <span id="s992">I used to be able to read that.</span> <span id="s993">And we studied Mishna.</span> <span id="s994">So I've done all that from when I was about ten until I was arrested, those years.</span> <span id="s995">And it was very serious and most pleasant.</span> <span id="s996">And every day we had Hebrew school after the public school, every day, including Sundays.</span> <span id="s997">So it was a wonderful life -- we have everything.</span> <span id="s998">And they had social events all the time, literary evenings, and that's usually when they brought in speakers.</span> <span id="s999">And my father was always kind of the master of ceremonies.</span> <span id="s1000">He was a really entertaining, and he played music.</span> <span id="s1001">So there was a whole wonderful life for us especially in Holland.</span> <span id="s1002">But going back to Auschwitz, it wasn't an event that is even where you can call it human.</span> <span id="s1003">It was at the other end of anything you can imagine.</span> <span id="s1004">The beatings, the devastation of the people, you could see it, and the loss of everything.</span> <span id="s1005">And then I worked in the work gangs and we saw them going into the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s1006">A lot of them didn't know.</span> <span id="s1007">The majority didn't know when they came right up the railroads in boxcars.</span> <span id="s1008">They didn't know.</span> <span id="s1009">We knew.</span> <span id="s1010">We didn't tell them, what's the use.</span> <span id="s1011">And the work gangs, we were right there.</span> <span id="s1012">The gathering, we were supposed to be gathering the -- on the crematorium.</span> <span id="s1013">But you did what you had to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">Q: Did anyone who was marching, were they close enough to ask you what was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">A: No, not that close.</span> <span id="s1016">And if you did talk to them they beat the hell out of you.</span> <span id="s1017">I mean it wasn't a matter of -- as an example when a guard threw a cigarette away, if you picked that cigarette up and you were caught you were dead.</span> <span id="s1018">You didn't go near the towers because, you know, they used to throw cigarettes out of the tower.</span> <span id="s1019">The newcomers didn't realize, they went for the cigarette butt and they never made it back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">Q: What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">A: They killed them, they shot them because they said well you're escaping, escaping.</span> <span id="s1022">These things you learn.</span> <span id="s1023">That's when I said friend taught me a lot of things real fast.</span> <span id="s1024">I had the fastest college education in about a day or a day and a half.</span> <span id="s1025">Those things are pure luck.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: Did you pray?</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">A: A lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: When you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: I remembered the Shabbas.</span> <span id="s1030">Yes.</span> <span id="s1031">And I still do.</span> <span id="s1032">And I take deep pride I think that I don't know any Jew who went through this, I don't know one, not that they are religious, but I don't know any Jew that I know personally who went through that who converted.</span> <span id="s1033">And that gives me deep pride.</span> <span id="s1034">Now, do we have a reason to convert or just drop the whole thing?</span> <span id="s1035">Yes we do, yes we do.</span> <span id="s1036">We saw there was no God in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1037">But then there was a God, for me there was one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">Q: In Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">A: Really.</span> <span id="s1040">I got out.</span> <span id="s1041">I got out.</span> <span id="s1042">My parents didn't.</span> <span id="s1043">My sister didn't.</span> <span id="s1044">But I still believe in God.</span> <span id="s1045">I couldn't function otherwise.</span> <span id="s1046">And I don't want to be even thinking that.</span> <span id="s1047">I do not to be a very religious Jew, not particularly.</span> <span id="s1048">I got to Temple and I keep the holidays and I fast and I don't eat pork.</span> <span id="s1049">But that is maybe because it's maybe a different world today.</span> <span id="s1050">If I were living in a certain area where this was more handy for me or I could find less excuses, I would like to live that way, I would like to spend more time studying the Torah and , I just don't have that.</span> <span id="s1051">I don't live in that -- which is only a cop-out on my part.</span> <span id="s1052">I understand it fully.</span> <span id="s1053">But I'm still dreaming that some day I'll have the time to do that.</span> <span id="s1054">So I have deep pride that my kind of Jews who were int eh camps with me stayed Jews.</span> <span id="s1055">And there must be exceptions I'm sure.</span> <span id="s1056">There may be.</span> <span id="s1057">But this is an important thing that I can think of.</span> <span id="s1058">The same thing I believe, the deepest pride I have, I have -- and we were liberated -- the towns around the camp.</span> <span id="s1059">And I will tell you and I have double checked there with my colleagues, there wasn't a German killed by a Jew who was a prisoner.</span> <span id="s1060">We took their food and we took their clothing because we needed it.</span> <span id="s1061">We didn't beat him up and we didn't kill him.</span> <span id="s1062">And I think that that gives me probably more pride as a Jew than anything that I can think of.</span> <span id="s1063">That we had seen the killings and we shouldn't have been killers.</span> <span id="s1064">There wasn't a German killed by a survivor, the Jewish survivors, because we didn't want to live like they lived with what they had done.</span> <span id="s1065">And we didn't stoop down to the levels that we had seen humanity, but we wanted to get out of there the faster the better.</span> <span id="s1066">That I will tell people as often as they ask me.</span> <span id="s1067">There was no German killed by Jews after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">Q: What did you think of other prisoners when you were there and yourself, what was happening to you and how did you view each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">A: There wasn't an intimate relationship.</span> <span id="s1070">First of all we didn't know each other.</span> <span id="s1071">We were all thrown together.</span> <span id="s1072">I didn't know -- I don't think I knew anybody.</span> <span id="s1073">Maybe one or two, maybe.</span> <span id="s1074">But that doesn't mean we were in the same bunk together.</span> <span id="s1075">And if you weren't in the same bunk together you had no time to do anything else.</span> <span id="s1076">So there was very little social intercommunicating, discussion, because during the day you couldn't because you were watched all the time, there was no talking, and at night it was too difficult.</span> <span id="s1077">Furthermore, it was a matter of survival too.</span> <span id="s1078">You were constantly watching over your shoulder.</span> <span id="s1079">To the extent that you did receive overnight, if you got a piece of bread in the evening you'd eat it as fast as you could.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">A: Because if you kept it out they stole it.</span> <span id="s1082">Somebody -- people were not human.</span> <span id="s1083">I'm not saying that they were thieves, they're not thieves.</span> <span id="s1084">You ate it so there was no possibility you could lose it.</span> <span id="s1085">And were that hungry anyhow.</span> <span id="s1086">But I don't remember in those days, and maybe later on when we get into the other camps we can talk about that, but it was a little different atmosphere in some other camp I'm thinking of for the moment.</span> <span id="s1087">There was some discussion, but as far as Birkenau was concerned it was all we saw was killings and dead people and beatings.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">Q: And at night?</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">02:43:39</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">A: At night they were running into the electric wires.</span> <span id="s1091">They had the a special commander with cars who would go along the wires to pick up the people who run into wires.</span> <span id="s1092">If they had the courage to do it, they'd just get it over with.</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">Q: Did you ever think about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">A: Not to go into the wires, no.</span> <span id="s1095">Once I tempted a guard to shoot me, but it was later.</span> <span id="s1096">Q: In Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">A: No, not in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1098">Later, I wanted to get it over with.</span> <span id="s1099">But he didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Q: You talked about getting a bowl.</span> <span id="s1101">Was that an individual bowl or was this a bowl that was shared?</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">A: No, it was shared.</span> <span id="s1103">I remember you had to share it.</span> <span id="s1104">Two people, three people, four people.</span> <span id="s1105">Q: How many of you were in the bunk together?</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">A: I don't remember.</span> <span id="s1107">But you couldn't lay on your back.</span> <span id="s1108">That much I remember.</span> <span id="s1109">You had to be on one side or the other side.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">Q: Did you talk at night?</span> <span id="s1111">A: I don't remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">Q: Could you sleep?</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">A: Yes, I'm sure we slept.</span> <span id="s1114">I'm sure we slept.</span> <span id="s1115">Because, you know, you worked during the day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">I'm sure we slept.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">Q: Do you remember noise in the barrack, smells?</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">A: Oh, the smells, I don't remember the smells.</span> <span id="s1119">I know there were smells.</span> <span id="s1120">There had to be.</span> <span id="s1121">I told you about the toilet facilities.</span> <span id="s1122">Yes, noise, screaming, people would -- I know it was bad.</span> <span id="s1123">I don't know the details.</span> <span id="s1124">I feel that, and it took me 40 years to even talk about it, I also feel that I really don't want to wake up totally to remember everything.</span> <span id="s1125">This is the first time, as you well know, that I am doing this.</span> <span id="s1126">And I lived in San Francisco all these years until I got involved in this Holocaust movement in the '70s, and I don't think anybody knew I was in the camps.</span> <span id="s1127">I don't wear short-sleeved shirts.</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">Q: You don't have short-sleeved shirts?</span> <span id="s1129">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">A: Because I never.</span> <span id="s1132">And I'm not the only one.</span> <span id="s1133">I've heard this by survivors, it's either sympathy, and you don't want that sympathy.</span> <span id="s1134">You don't want to advertise it.</span> <span id="s1135">And I also believe another thing, Joan, that there were a lot of survivors who was ashamed that they were alive after the war.</span> <span id="s1136">For whatever reason they survived and the rest didn't.</span> <span id="s1137">And I think it also had to do with another thing, when we came back from the war there was no one who was interested.</span> <span id="s1138">We had no one to talk to.</span> <span id="s1139">We had no one to talk to.</span> <span id="s1140">Now, it's a little different.</span> <span id="s1141">But there was no oral history project, there wasn't even a social worker.</span> <span id="s1142">There wasn't even a friend.</span> <span id="s1143">There were no friends left.</span> <span id="s1144">There were no parents.</span> <span id="s1145">And everybody had problems after the Jews came back from either hiding or from the camps, and everyone was trying to put their life together.</span> <span id="s1146">And the survivors, nobody was interested in us.</span> <span id="s1147">We made it ourselves.</span> <span id="s1148">We had no one.</span> <span id="s1149">I had no one to talk to, and I know my friends didn't either.</span> <span id="s1150">And we didn't talk to each other because we already talked to each other.</span> <span id="s1151">We saw it with our own eyes how much more.</span> <span id="s1152">My friend who I told you about, my friend I saw again in Birkenau, he visits me every few years.</span> <span id="s1153">He's been here about a dozen times.</span> <span id="s1154">He lives in Bodachia (ph) now, in Bodachia now, .</span> <span id="s1155">We never talk about this.</span> <span id="s1156">When I bring it up sometimes just to -- he says next issue.</span> <span id="s1157">We never talk about it.</span> <span id="s1158">So we had no one to talk to.</span> <span id="s1159">So why advertise it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">Q: When you were in Auschwitz his name was?</span> <span id="s1161">A: Hans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">Q: Hans.</span> <span id="s1163">He warned you about things in Auschwitz didn't he?</span> <span id="s1164">A: Well, in general.</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">Q: What was going on, what kind of work he was doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">A: Well, I know what he was, he worked and he was at that time when I met him he was in charge of about maybe a hundred people repairing sewing machines and typewriters, something like this.</span> <span id="s1167">Because he was a mechanic who knew how to teach those people.</span> <span id="s1168">It was for the administration there.</span> <span id="s1169">And then he also was a magician, so he had to do magic for those people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">Q: He performed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">A: For the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">Q: A lot?</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">A: Not at the time I got there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Q: Did you ever see him perform?</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">A: Not there, no.</span> <span id="s1176">Here in our country, oh yes, when he put magic -- together.</span> <span id="s1177">He's now well known.</span> <span id="s1178">He became well known after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">Q: Did you know other boys your own age in Auschwitz, 16?</span> <span id="s1180">You were about 15, 16 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">A: Yes, well there were some of them the same age.</span> <span id="s1182">Most of course were older.</span> <span id="s1183">I don't remember.</span> <span id="s1184">I don't remember anybody except Hans, my friend.</span> <span id="s1185">And the others were all strangers to me.</span> <span id="s1186">I was thrown in with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">Q: You were near the gypsy camp?</span> <span id="s1188">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">Q: Do you remember seeing the gypsies?</span> <span id="s1190">02:49:00</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">A: Yes, we saw through the barbed wire, yes.</span> <span id="s1192">Well, at camp I remember a lot of people in there, very heavily populated.</span> <span id="s1193">And they had their own clothes and they were men, women and children.</span> <span id="s1194">And I remember at night they used to play the violin.</span> <span id="s1195">I remember that distinctly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">This wonderful deep staccatto and the music the gypsies played.</span> <span id="s1197">I know someone in our area who is a gypsy and I ask him to do it and they can't do it like that, not the way we heard it, the way I remember it.</span> <span id="s1198">The shadows as you know, the gypsies, the Hungarian gypsies especially.</span> <span id="s1199">So I remember that music, I remember that music.</span> <span id="s1200">And I also remember they beat them up a lot.</span> <span id="s1201">They used to beat the gypsies a lot -- screaming, we heard the screaming.</span> <span id="s1202">But that was all over the camp.</span> <span id="s1203">That's about all I remember.</span> <span id="s1204">I wasn't yet long there, you see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">Q: Were you surprised that there were families together?</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">A: To us there was no surprises.</span> <span id="s1207">I mean it was all happening, things that we had no relationship to, neither did we understand it.</span> <span id="s1208">I mean we just accepted hour by hour, day by day.</span> <span id="s1209">I mean things were moving so fast, but there was hunger and the living conditions and the beatings and the killings.</span> <span id="s1210">I used to see there the camp commander, I think was (ph), I think it was, used to drive through the camps of Birkenau on a motorcycle with a pistol and whoever was in front of him he shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">Q: Did you see that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">Q: Is that the first time you saw somebody killed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">A: I don't know when I saw the first person killed.</span> <span id="s1215">I don't remember.</span> <span id="s1216">But I remember him doing that.</span> <span id="s1217">On a motorcycle, running through the camp, and if he saw somebody in his way he shot them.</span> <span id="s1218">And we saw in front of the gas chambers when we worked there, you saw them throw the babies in the air, smash the babies against the walls when they were standing in line.</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">Q: You saw that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">Q: Did you think about nothing, were you frightened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">A: Well, it all was part of everything.</span> <span id="s1223">I don't remember my emotions, because if you stopped working they beat you, so you kept on working and shuffling with a shovel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">Q: Did you dream at night?</span> <span id="s1225">A: Then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">A: I don't remember.</span> <span id="s1228">I don't know if I dream now.</span> <span id="s1229">But I remember, I don't know, I still, and maybe it's not the proper way to express it, but I have this deep down feeling that I was in a coma, in a hypnosis for the entire duration of my camp life.</span> <span id="s1230">I mean maybe it's because you were so young.</span> <span id="s1231">And probably that's what it is because very few older people, very older people couldn't handle it.</span> <span id="s1232">I was a child and maybe that's what gave me the benefit.</span> <span id="s1233">Now, today I think different than I know I thought then.</span> <span id="s1234">And only in very recent years, especially of the work I'm doing now even though it's voluntary, and some days I feel maybe I shouldn't have gotten involved in it, but then I also feel very strong, almost overwhelmingly that we have to tell this story.</span> <span id="s1235">There was another drive I think I had and always had, everybody, to be able -- and I wanted it so badly, there was nothing more, than anything else that I wanted to get out and tell the story, and I think that drove me more than anything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">Q: You thought about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1238">And I believed I was going to do that.</span> <span id="s1239">I always believed that I was going to tell the story.</span> <span id="s1240">Because it drove me so much that how well they know -- I remember I used to hear the scream "Sohor, Sohor," remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">Q: Who would scream?</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">Q: Whoever the Jews were when they were beating them, "Sohor, tell, remember, remember what they did to us."</span> <span id="s1243">I learned sohor very early in life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">Q: This hope that you had and the sense that you would get out and tell the story, do you think that was essential to you're being able to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">A: Well, it didn't help me of creating the situation because I think the situation was created strictly by accident and maybe with the help of God, but it certainly helped me to keep my senses to the extent and to have not all these horrible things penetrate my mind, because I'm certainly not a criminal.</span> <span id="s1246">And what I have seen I should be a criminal.</span> <span id="s1247">It happened to a good friend of mine, a friend I had in camp, a young boy my age who came out, and we can talk about it later, and became a criminal, a son of a rabbi, a Polish boy.</span> <span id="s1248">He became a criminal in Amsterdam after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">Q: Let's stop now.</span> <span id="s1250">The tape is going to run out.</span> <span id="s1251">A: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">Q: Let's stop.</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">A: That's another story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">Q: -- later we can go back to your friend who became a criminal.</span> <span id="s1256">A: That's after the war.</span> <span id="s1257">It wasn't really a nice story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">Q: Had you seen women in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">A: We saw them at a distance, very distant.</span> <span id="s1260">No, we didn't see them close.</span> <span id="s1261">When they march by sometimes, but not very close by.</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">Q: Did you notice when you saw them marching that they were in a different condition than the men?</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s1264">But we knew they were women because they had dresses rather than jackets or pants like we had.</span> <span id="s1265">But then they were bald.</span> <span id="s1266">As you well know they were also shaven.</span> <span id="s1267">But we knew they were there, we saw them.</span> <span id="s1268">You couldn't talk to them.</span> <span id="s1269">You couldn't talk to anybody from any other camp, any other compounds, so-called, what you may call compounds.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">Q: Did you ever see women guards?</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s1272">With the women, yes, women kapos.</span> <span id="s1273">And we know they treat the women very badly, very very badly, and we knew that .</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">Q: Worse than the men?</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">A: Well, we heard a lot of screaming.</span> <span id="s1276">The screamings we knew.</span> <span id="s1277">We heard the screamings.</span> <span id="s1278">That we knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">Q: Did you stay on this road work the whole time --</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">A: I remember, yes.</span> <span id="s1281">He worked on the work gangs.</span> <span id="s1282">All I remember there were work gangs in the camp, outside the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">Q: Did you lose a lot of weight?</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1285">I never became a Muselmann.</span> <span id="s1286">Do you know what a Muselmann was?</span> <span id="s1287">Q: No.</span> <span id="s1288">Explain it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">A: A Muselmann were really the ones which it would be unfortunate to see today on television when you see Somalia.</span> <span id="s1290">That's how a lot of not all, most of our people looked.</span> <span id="s1291">But if you get to that stage, since there was no help, that's how they ended up.</span> <span id="s1292">And they called them newswoman.</span> <span id="s1293">I can't watch that on television I swear.</span> <span id="s1294">I've seen a lot as you well know.</span> <span id="s1295">When I see that Somalia thing, I'm ashamed to say that I cannot watch it, I have to turn my head away.</span> <span id="s1296">It bothers me no end.</span> <span id="s1297">And that's how a lot of our prisoners, all throughout the other camps too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">Q: Did you ever see yourself in a mirror at Auschwitz?</span> <span id="s1299">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">Q: In a glass?</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">A: No.</span> <span id="s1302">In Warsaw that's different.</span> <span id="s1303">And you'll find out why in Warsaw, because the buildings there they got into, but not in Birkenau, uh-uh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">Q: Is there anything else you would like to say about Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">A: No.</span> <span id="s1306">A lot of things are in my heart and my soul and my mind, but I don't know anything in particular I can think of at this moment except that it was so overwhelming.</span> <span id="s1307">People say well why didn't you do something, why didn't you escape, why wasn't -- the question isn't even justifiable because in Auschwitz the fear, the electric wires, the beatings, the hunger, the starvation, the degradation, you know, the way you were treated, you never had time to think.</span> <span id="s1308">And then again I have to admit I'm in such a hypnosis still about that today, that now when I do remember things like chlorine, I can't stand the smell of chlorine.</span> <span id="s1309">When I have chlorine in the water sometimes, especially here you Washingtonians, I can't stand your water because it has a chlorine smell and it reminds me of Auschwitz and Birkenau, and all the camps for that matter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">Q: Why does it remind you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">A: Because they used to spread chlorine around for disinfectant and that smell was always overwhelming.</span> <span id="s1312">And the burning of hair, I can't bear to smell that, for me.</span> <span id="s1313">Or flesh because it reminds you of the crematoria.</span> <span id="s1314">But you asked me have you been back to Auschwitz, I will not go back.</span> <span id="s1315">I will never go back to any camp, and I can't.</span> <span id="s1316">I don't want to wake up.</span> <span id="s1317">I think that's what it is.</span> <span id="s1318">I'm afraid to wake up, really wake up.</span> <span id="s1319">And since I'm having a very good normal life, and I think I can function quite well, I believe, maybe not everybody agrees with me, but I agree with me on that issue, I don't want that potential interference.</span> <span id="s1320">So I want it to stay the way it is.</span> <span id="s1321">That's why I've never done an oral history until now.</span> <span id="s1322">And look how many years, 48 years, right.</span> <span id="s1323">Yes, let's leave Auschwitz, and maybe something else will come to my mind.</span> <span id="s1324">But it's very deeply buried, it's very deeply buried, and let's leave it that way for the time being at least.</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">Q: So let's talk about your friend coming to see you about going on this trip unknown.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">A: Yes, it's called transport unknown, something like that.</span> <span id="s1327">And we went on that, 300 men from Birkenau.</span> <span id="s1328">I believe they were all from Birkenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">Q: And he's the one who helped you get on this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">A: He helped me indeed.</span> <span id="s1331">Without him I wouldn't be around there.</span> <span id="s1332">And how he did it I have no idea.</span> <span id="s1333">And it could very well be that part of the barracks I was in, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1334">I remember he said you must go on this.</span> <span id="s1335">Because I asked him -- no, I didn't ask him, he told me.</span> <span id="s1336">I said what should I do, and he said you go because I'm going on it and he took me.</span> <span id="s1337">And then we went back to the boxcars one day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">Q: Took the same kind of a trip?</span> <span id="s1339">03:09:46</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">A: No.</span> <span id="s1341">I remember they gave us a piece of bread when we got into the boxcar.</span> <span id="s1342">That I remember.</span> <span id="s1343">I don't know why I remember that, but I remember that.</span> <span id="s1344">Maybe I was very hungry.</span> <span id="s1345">And then we went in a boxcar.</span> <span id="s1346">I don't know how long this trip was.</span> <span id="s1347">It couldn't have been very long.</span> <span id="s1348">If it was a day or two or one day, I don't know how long it was.</span> <span id="s1349">I know that we ended up in a very large railroad yard in the city, and then of course we found out it was Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1350">And this was in the summer of '43 I believe.</span> <span id="s1351">I don't know the dates because we didn't know dates.</span> <span id="s1352">The only reason we knew it was Sunday in Auschwitz was because it was selection day.</span> <span id="s1353">That's the only reason we knew that.</span> <span id="s1354">And then we were marched from the railroad yards in Warsaw to this bombed city, this bombed section of the city.</span> <span id="s1355">And there were fires still going, and there were many dead bodies laying in the streets and a lot of debris.</span> <span id="s1356">And I remember there were no barracks, that there were sections of barracks laying there.</span> <span id="s1357">They marched us into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1358">We found out later this was the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1359">And we marked in, and I think the first couple of days we slept outside somewhere until they built this barracks, a wooden barracks.</span> <span id="s1360">Better ones than we had in Auschwitz I must say that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">Q: And who built these, did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">A: Yes, the prisoners had to do most of the work, but it was German supervision.</span> <span id="s1363">There were foreman there who were not prisoners.</span> <span id="s1364">But the prisoners did all of the labor.</span> <span id="s1365">Us guys.</span> <span id="s1366">And then when we started working, and the reason we were there, we were sent there to dynamite the ghetto, to destroy all the evidence, to dynamite all the buildings, to preserve as much raw material as we could find from transformers to cable, electric wiring, copper wiring, wood.</span> <span id="s1367">And a lot of prisoners polished bricks because those buildings, and I happen to be, for a reason that I don't know why, but I was on the demolition team and we had to plant dynamite, dynamite they called it, underneath the walls.</span> <span id="s1368">And then the Germans handled the plunger, the wires.</span> <span id="s1369">We had to set the wires.</span> <span id="s1370">And I remember a few occasions they, for joy rides, they'd push the plunger before the prisoners got out and got away from the walls.</span> <span id="s1371">I got hit over my legs a few times.</span> <span id="s1372">We didn't run fast enough because we had nothing, we didn't have decent shoes, and couldn't walk that fast because we were not that well fed.</span> <span id="s1373">And that's what I did for quite a while.</span> <span id="s1374">And then for a while I did, and another groups of maybe 30 guys, we had to find transformers in buildings, electrical transformers, and we had to put them on trucks.</span> <span id="s1375">And that also was part of the war machine.</span> <span id="s1376">And then I worked for quite a while in the railroad yards where the equipment was transferred to and from the eastern front, the Russian front.</span> <span id="s1377">So that was about what we did.</span> <span id="s1378">And one day I remember -- oh, and my friend Hans was my helper and sometimes I got upset with him, he once said I got a good job, he said I have five people going to some work detail on the other side of the waxer to a German army camp, army whatever, maybe we can get some food there because five guys maybe they feed you.</span> <span id="s1379">So he put me, and I remember, and I was reminded of it recently when two boys, two boys from Croatia, from Zagreb, they were very nice boys, you know, my age, and two others, and I forgot the others, I think one was a boy from Berlin, and we went there on a truck to this army post, German army post.</span> <span id="s1380">They were all SS troops, most of them.</span> <span id="s1381">And we dug fortifications.</span> <span id="s1382">We have to dig trenches.</span> <span id="s1383">And they beat us up terribly that day, just beat us up terribly.</span> <span id="s1384">And two of the boys were killed that day.</span> <span id="s1385">One of the brothers and one other man.</span> <span id="s1386">So out of the five only two walked out.</span> <span id="s1387">So that night when I found my friend I tell him don't do me any more favors.</span> <span id="s1388">And so that was Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1389">And then I worked in Laundry for a while.</span> <span id="s1390">And my friend he had a job of assigning detail sometimes so he was always helping me, he was always helping me.</span> <span id="s1391">And Warsaw was different because we lived in this ghetto.</span> <span id="s1392">A camp, about two camps they was building.</span> <span id="s1393">And they give us one camp and then we built a new camp.</span> <span id="s1394">We all got to do that.</span> <span id="s1395">So out in the big ghetto there and the first camp, and then during the winter, in the spring, in January there was another camp, and 300 were amplified by several thousand, a lot of Hungarian Jews.</span> <span id="s1396">And at the tail end we got out of Warsaw, there were 3,600 prisoners there.</span> <span id="s1397">And a lot of them died even during this period while we were there.</span> <span id="s1398">But 3,600 and they were mostly Hungarian Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">Q: All men?</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">A: All men.</span> <span id="s1401">No, we never saw women.</span> <span id="s1402">The only time we saw women was when we were in trucks going to some work details on the streets.</span> <span id="s1403">In addition to that they also did a lot of shooting of Polish political prisoners in the ghetto in our camp and we had to burn the corpses.</span> <span id="s1404">There were a lot of corpses when we got there first.</span> <span id="s1405">We found basements full of corpses.</span> <span id="s1406">That's a prison they had there and lots of bodies we found.</span> <span id="s1407">We burned them.</span> <span id="s1408">There was stacks we had to build.</span> <span id="s1409">And one day we spend a few days in the Pawiak, I don't know about ten of us who got sent there for a detail, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">Q: Do you want to explain Pawiak?</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">A: Pawiak was a fellow prison in the City of Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1412">I don't know if it's still there.</span> <span id="s1413">But we were sent there for some work detail.</span> <span id="s1414">I remember spending there a couple of days.</span> <span id="s1415">I remember, the only thing I remember this heavy heavy stone buildings.</span> <span id="s1416">And the fed us soup.</span> <span id="s1417">That shows you what you remember, some odd things.</span> <span id="s1418">And it tasted like pure soap water.</span> <span id="s1419">So I asked them why is there so much soap in there, and the reason, this person explained, whoever it was, said apparently the soap, and I'm not talking about the Jewish people, I'm talking about the prisoners in this Pawiak, the reason they gave them this soap, they threw a bar of soap in every soup kettle because it would decrease their sexual desires.</span> <span id="s1420">Soap or whatever chemical, that's what they explained to us.</span> <span id="s1421">Because it tasted like soap, which was even delicious, better than what we had in the camp.</span> <span id="s1422">But I remember they used that.</span> <span id="s1423">We didn't have that problem, the Jewish prisoners, believe me.</span> <span id="s1424">So Warsaw, we didn't have the hunger because we found a lot of food in the buildings, staples.</span> <span id="s1425">There were still staples to be found, barley, things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">Q: And you were allowed to keep these?</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">A: If you could find it and could hide it.</span> <span id="s1428">If they caught you you were in trouble.</span> <span id="s1429">But we also had other avenues, and while we were in the ghetto the Poles came in and bought the bricks, the polished brick, and we used to find clothes and save them bundled up and sold them the clothes for a piece of bread or a couple of onions or some garlic and even sometimes vodka.</span> <span id="s1430">And they brought things with them and they thought it was our's, those Poles who came in, they had this cart with a horse in front of it, so they brought in food, not because they liked us, only because it was a business deal.</span> <span id="s1431">I didn't speak Polish, but we had Poles who could speak the language.</span> <span id="s1432">And then there were what we found also was in the early days when we were in Warsaw, Jews were in the bunkers, who once had done the uprising, and they were still in bunkers and they came out when the dynamiting started.</span> <span id="s1433">And when the Germans of course saw them they shot them on site.</span> <span id="s1434">But I remember also one day there was a boy and a girl came out.</span> <span id="s1435">The Poles had been supplying them with food.</span> <span id="s1436">And they run out of money and out of gold and I saw a Pole kill this girl.</span> <span id="s1437">He killed her because he didn't want to have her alive so in case she would implicate him.</span> <span id="s1438">They weren't very nice.</span> <span id="s1439">And they were very bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">And so they didn't help us out of any human point of view, they helped us because it served them.</span> <span id="s1441">And I remember we worked in the railroad yards and they had Germany material like uniforms and shoes, etcetera.</span> <span id="s1442">And we sold and traded, not so much traded, with the Polish railroad people, traded with them for food.</span> <span id="s1443">So the hunger was not as bad in Warsaw as it had been in Birkenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s1444">Q: What was the barracks situation like, you said it was better?</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">A: Well, it was more modern.</span> <span id="s1446">I'll use those words.</span> <span id="s1447">But they were a little better and there also was heat, there was a stove there.</span> <span id="s1448">A typical Polish stove out of stone I think they were made.</span> <span id="s1449">I remember there was heat in there.</span> <span id="s1450">Not always that we had something to burn, but there was enough wood laying around because of the demolition we did on those buildings, so it didn't cost anything to the Germans.</span> <span id="s1451">But there is one point I want to make that just came to my mind.</span> <span id="s1452">I happen to believe very strongly, and maybe that's in conclusion later on, that this entire issue of the Jews, Auschwitz, etcetera, the destruction of the six million of our people was a very large money-making event for the Germans.</span> <span id="s1453">That served and financed the biggest part of the war industry.</span> <span id="s1454">Because a few realize how much we were told what to bring.</span> <span id="s1455">You realized that every person who went through Birkenau that I know of, and other camps I'm sure the same, and all the gas and all the crematoriums in the different camps, they looked in your mouth and if you had gold fillings -- had rings, my mother had a wedding ring and my father had a wedding band, so did everyone else who were married couples, there was enormous hordes of gold.</span> <span id="s1456">And I remember one day in Warsaw I found in a house, someone had found, and we had four diamonds, four diamond stones.</span> <span id="s1457">Was worth about, maybe 5-6 carats of diamond.</span> <span id="s1458">I didn't know anything about that, but somebody said it's a very good amount.</span> <span id="s1459">I sold it for a little piece of bread to a Hungarian because he only got there three days before.</span> <span id="s1460">He thought he made a big purchase.</span> <span id="s1461">Well, I had the bread and I lived and he had no bread that day or for two days, so he didn't get anything for two days.</span> <span id="s1462">So there was so much, I mean dollar bills, gold laying on the streets, silver.</span> <span id="s1463">But the wealth of just the clothing alone, you'll see the lists that we have at our museum, and the valuable things just pulled out of that ghetto, and that's done in many places, that financed the Germans.</span> <span id="s1464">It was a money making event for the Germans.</span> <span id="s1465">It was a money making event.</span> <span id="s1466">Aside from they hated the Jews and wanted them all killed, but they made money on the deal.</span> <span id="s1467">The clothing, the hair was sold all over the world, recycled in some form.</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">Q: When I mentioned whether you had seen yourself in Auschwitz you said no, but you didn't explain?</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">A: We, we were working in all these buildings, while we were working there were some mirrors there and you saw.</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">Q: Were you surprised at what you saw?</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">A: No.</span> <span id="s1472">You didn't have much time for that.</span> <span id="s1473">It didn't make any difference.</span> <span id="s1474">It didn't make any difference.</span> <span id="s1475">What did a mirror mean to us, what did a piece of gold mean to us.</span> <span id="s1476">Gold had nothing to do with it.</span> <span id="s1477">There was no one to sell it to or give it too.</span> <span id="s1478">It was almost laying on the streets.</span> <span id="s1479">It had no value, what could you do with it?</span> <span id="s1480">If you couldn't get food with it, it doesn't mean a damn.</span> <span id="s1481">So that taught me, and I've said it often to younger people, that wealth is only good if you buy a very fancy painting, it's only good if you can enjoy it and look at this painting.</span> <span id="s1482">But what happens if you need to sell it and there is no one to buy it, then whatever you paid for this write it off real fast.</span> <span id="s1483">It has no value if you can't sell it, if there's no buyer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">And that's what happened when I had those four pieces of diamonds in my hand.</span> <span id="s1485">I had one buyer and he didn't survive because he gave me his bread.</span> <span id="s1486">He was dumb enough to do it, but I was at that point seasoned, and I don't want to say smart, certainly seasoned that I knew I couldn't do anything with the diamonds except I needed a greenhorn to sell it to because I was hungry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">Q: Were the relationships among you as prisoners there, 3,600 you said, not that you had relations with 3,600 people, was it different than Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">A: No comparison.</span> <span id="s1489">Much much easier.</span> <span id="s1490">It was easier.</span> <span id="s1491">But we were under the treat of being killed by selection.</span> <span id="s1492">We died because there was typhoid in Warsaw by the way, and I had typhoid, but a very mild case, and I wasn't in the Krankenbau, in the hospital so-called.</span> <span id="s1493">But I got out not very much before when the Russians broke through and got out.</span> <span id="s1494">But I was in there for a while, not long.</span> <span id="s1495">And many died because there was typhoid in there.</span> <span id="s1496">That's why they kept shin the camp.</span> <span id="s1497">There were 3,600 left at that point.</span> <span id="s1498">And I think at one time there was probably close to 5,000 there.</span> <span id="s1499">The camps replenished.</span> <span id="s1500">That number is -- but I know it was more than 3,600.</span> <span id="s1501">And he was told to kill them all.</span> <span id="s1502">And I'm told, and this is all hearsay, that the Polish underground who was watching the camp very much so because they used to take, the Polish Resistance --brought them in the ghetto and shut them in there with us -- on one wall there and we had to turn them then.</span> <span id="s1503">The Polish underground allegedly told the Germans that if you kill all these people you'll never get out yourself, I'm told, because it was not difficult for them to do.</span> <span id="s1504">And we heard the rumblings of the big guns that was here already because the Russians were breaking through.</span> <span id="s1505">So one morning they had 300 in the beds still, who couldn't get out of the bed.</span> <span id="s1506">They shot them.</span> <span id="s1507">300, correct.</span> <span id="s1508">And 300 were kept there.</span> <span id="s1509">And the reason I know is because a fellow I was friendly with because he was my age, was a Berlin Jew, and he was selected to be and he had to stay there, that 300.</span> <span id="s1510">And those 300 were kept there to destroy all evidence, and they were killed.</span> <span id="s1511">That we were told later on.</span> <span id="s1512">I don't know how I know, but I know.</span> <span id="s1513">And because they were killed while we were marching out already, they just burned the barracks or dynamited.</span> <span id="s1514">It was done very very fast.</span> <span id="s1515">And 3,000 marched out, and we marched and we marched and I remember two things very distinctly.</span> <span id="s1516">Number one, that you tried not to be in the back because we heard the machine guns going constantly and we were told that anybody who drops out is going to be killed.</span> <span id="s1517">And they left their corpses right on the road.</span> <span id="s1518">So they had maybe four or five machine guns in the back of some army truck and they shot those people.</span> <span id="s1519">All men, there were no women there.</span> <span id="s1520">They were all men.</span> <span id="s1521">And we marched and here is the thing I remember as much as anything else, we came, it was in the summer, it was very hot, no water, and for some reason it rained once and we were going like this with our soup pan and we tried to catch the raindrops.</span> <span id="s1522">We were very very thirsty, almost to the point of sanity.</span> <span id="s1523">People were going insane, people were drinking their urine.</span> <span id="s1524">And all of a sudden we came over on a bridge, and over the bridge we saw a river.</span> <span id="s1525">And they took us over the bridge and there was a huge field there, an open field and we went in that field apparently to stay overnight, but to wait for something.</span> <span id="s1526">And we pushed, the masses pushed so hard, and I happened to be in the earlier part of this grouping of 3,000.</span> <span id="s1527">Of course it was not 3,000 anymore, but I was in the first, maybe the second hundred or third hundred, very up front.</span> <span id="s1528">We got into this river, you could wade into the river and we drank and we drank and we drank.</span> <span id="s1529">But the masses in back of us were so anxious to get to that water they kept on pushing and they pushed us too far in the river so we couldn't walk, and they wouldn't stop.</span> <span id="s1530">And the Germans didn't know what to do, so they thought that we would go in the river and get to the other side and escape.</span> <span id="s1531">So they start shooting from the bridge and from the other side.</span> <span id="s1532">They used machine guns.</span> <span id="s1533">They shot.</span> <span id="s1534">And I remember, because I wake up often, that river turned as red as blood.</span> <span id="s1535">And the Jews wouldn't stop.</span> <span id="s1536">Our people would not stop.</span> <span id="s1537">They kept on pushing from the back.</span> <span id="s1538">And they couldn't stop the Jew and these people.</span> <span id="s1539">On the German side, they kept killing with bullets and they brought the dogs in.</span> <span id="s1540">And the people in charge made those soldiers, those German SS go in the water with the dogs and when the dogs got into the water the Jews stopped.</span> <span id="s1541">They wouldn't stop for the bullets.</span> <span id="s1542">That I remember.</span> <span id="s1543">And then they stopped pushing.</span> <span id="s1544">I was out by then.</span> <span id="s1545">Because, you know, I got out because they pushed and it came up to here in the water so I got out.</span> <span id="s1546">None of us could swim.</span> <span id="s1547">I don't know how many could swim.</span> <span id="s1548">I know I couldn't swim.</span> <span id="s1549">I told you I couldn't go to the swim because I was a Jew.</span> <span id="s1550">They never taught me how to swim.</span> <span id="s1551">So the soil was just bodies and blood, and I could only think about why they called it the Red Sea.</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">There's no connection there, but it was red as pure blood.</span> <span id="s1553">And they killed a lot.</span> <span id="s1554">They killed, in my estimation, at least 1,000 people there, maybe more.</span> <span id="s1555">No one knows.</span> <span id="s1556">But there were very few who got into the trains.</span> <span id="s1557">And I don't remember if we walked much more, but in the end we got in boxcars.</span> <span id="s1558">I know the town, that much I remember, Zychlin.</span> <span id="s1559">That much I remember.</span> <span id="s1560">Because you could see the names on there, and I remember Zychlin, so I knew that we had marched due west from Warsaw and then we start trip in boxcars again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">Q: And why did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">A: We back in boxcars for quite a while, I remember.</span> <span id="s1563">And there was no water and no food.</span> <span id="s1564">I remember that.</span> <span id="s1565">But I know we used the dead bodies to sit for seats or benches alongside.</span> <span id="s1566">And I remember that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">Q: Who did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">A: And then --</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">Q: So that was the worst experience in those boxcars?</span></p> <p><span id="s1570">A: That was, yes.</span> <span id="s1571">That was the last time I was in a boxcar.</span> <span id="s1572">And I remember when they opened the doors it was Dachau, and very few got out of the trains.</span> <span id="s1573">I believe only maybe 200, 300, 400 at the most.</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">[Technical conversation]</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">Q: I hate to ask you to do this, but can you re-describe the boxcar trip from Zychlin to Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">A: After we went through that river, I don't know how much time there was, not much time until we were back in boxcars in Zychlin.</span> <span id="s1577">I know that's where we started this trip.</span> <span id="s1578">We were in the boxcars and for how long I don't remember.</span> <span id="s1579">I know a lot of people died en route because we had no food and no water after we had gotten out of the water that day in the river.</span> <span id="s1580">But no food.</span> <span id="s1581">And we ended up in Dachau.</span> <span id="s1582">That much I know.</span> <span id="s1583">We were in Dachau.</span> <span id="s1584">And I think we were only in Dachau for maybe a day or two or less and we went to Allach, which is a side camp to Dachau.</span> <span id="s1585">We ended up there.</span> <span id="s1586">No, pardon me.</span> <span id="s1587">We went to Dachau, I'm too early, to Dachau, and I don't know where we were in Dachau, but I know that about 200 to 300 only got out of the boxcars.</span> <span id="s1588">We sat on the corpses.</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">Q: You said that this was the worst boxcar experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">A: Well, because there was these people, first of all they were in very bad shape when we got started on this death march, then that river episode.</span> <span id="s1591">We had drank too much water without food and there was dysentery, what do you all it, dysentery, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">Q: Dysentery.</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">A: Dysentery.</span> <span id="s1594">So everything there was just horrible.</span> <span id="s1595">And they died.</span> <span id="s1596">Some were delirious.</span> <span id="s1597">And when we got out we were in Dachau.</span> <span id="s1598">And we didn't stay there too long.</span> <span id="s1599">And in Dachau, I don't know how, but I think we went in boxcars again, but I'm not too sure.</span> <span id="s1600">It could have been trucks.</span> <span id="s1601">I think it was trucks.</span> <span id="s1602">I remember that.</span> <span id="s1603">We were taken out of Dachau again and we were taken to Landsberg area, Kaufering area, and there were a lot of small camps.</span> <span id="s1604">We were in a camp and there were other people there already and we were thrown in with them.</span> <span id="s1605">I don't know how many.</span> <span id="s1606">I think there were maybe 1,000, 1,500 people in this camp.</span> <span id="s1607">They were barracks.</span> <span id="s1608">They were put on top of --they dug a hole and put a V, two roofs, I can't think of the name right now, but you had to step down.</span> <span id="s1609">You sat down there on the ground.</span> <span id="s1610">And we were in there for quite a while, from '44 until -- we worked in various things.</span> <span id="s1611">The biggest work they did was digging underground munitions factories.</span> <span id="s1612">What the Germans did, they built those V2, it's V2 things they were building out there, but we were building the buildings for that.</span> <span id="s1613">And they used us prisoners, thousands of prisoners, to build a mountain, a mountain of dirt and sand and gravel, and when the mountain was high enough, maybe 40, 50 foot high, they carried over the wooden pallets and wheelbarrows and then they poured cement on top of it and then they washed it out.</span> <span id="s1614">So they built a building reversing the trench, see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">Q: Did you do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">03:44:15</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1618">I worked there to carry dirt up these planks, you walked up and you dumped it and you got more.</span> <span id="s1619">So you had this hugh mountain.</span> <span id="s1620">And then they put lots of cement around it.</span> <span id="s1621">I don't know, I didn't know much about construction, at least not what I know today.</span> <span id="s1622">And that was used for the V2 rocket engines up there on the buildings.</span> <span id="s1623">We lost of lot of people there because there was typhoid again.</span> <span id="s1624">The food was very mediocre of very bad.</span> <span id="s1625">There were lots of beatings but not as much as we had seen in previous camps.</span> <span id="s1626">Everything was bad.</span> <span id="s1627">And the attrition was very very high.</span> <span id="s1628">But there bodies weren't burned.</span> <span id="s1629">They were taken to a site in mass graves, hugh mass graves.</span> <span id="s1630">I don't think they have ever been found.</span> <span id="s1631">I wouldn't be able to find them.</span> <span id="s1632">They were huge mass graves.</span> <span id="s1633">It's not very far from the Landsberg prisons where Hitler had been.</span> <span id="s1634">It's very close by there.</span> <span id="s1635">But huge mass graves.</span> <span id="s1636">And it was so bad that we had a lot of suicides there.</span> <span id="s1637">People were going into the electric wires.</span> <span id="s1638">And I remember that's the only time I ever saw cannibalism.</span> <span id="s1639">There was so little food in '45 there in January and February and March that we saw that they were cannibalizing the bodies and people were eating it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">Q: Were you tempted?</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">A: No.</span> <span id="s1642">No, I never was tempted.</span> <span id="s1643">I wasn't that bad off.</span> <span id="s1644">I was bad off, but not that bad off yet.</span> <span id="s1645">But I have seen it.</span> <span id="s1646">You saw it.</span> <span id="s1647">And the Germans caught those people and they killed them.</span> <span id="s1648">So either they were dead or they went into electric wires.</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">Q: So this was surrounded just like the other camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1651">Except it was smaller than the other camps we had been in.</span> <span id="s1652">There must have been maybe a dozen of them out there in the area.</span> <span id="s1653">There were a lot of them.</span> <span id="s1654">It was Mühldorf and Kaufering and Landsberg, and the names just --</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">Q: Were the procedures the same with roll call?</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">A: Roll call, the same thing.</span> <span id="s1657">The same thing and work, work, work, and no food and there was typhoid around and it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">Q: And what did they do for uniforms, did you have the same uniforms?</span> <span id="s1659">A: Always the same.</span> <span id="s1660">All the same uniforms, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1661">Q: You didn't change?</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">A: Well, I don't know how we got -- we may have given them when they were torn and you got others, but we always had those stripers.</span> <span id="s1663">And I remember it got very cold in '44 and '45 because it's in Bavaria.</span> <span id="s1664">And that took a lot of lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">Q: Were you able to get additional clothes somehow?</span> <span id="s1666">Did you steal clothes from the people who died?</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1668">If you could, but you had to show them -- there were inspections too, so if you were caught, if you were caught anywhere with more than what you were supposed to have you'd wish you hadn't done it.</span> <span id="s1669">They killed you or beat you.</span> <span id="s1670">Then there were many days when the people did escape or tried, and they caught them all.</span> <span id="s1671">I've never seen anybody that I know of who got out.</span> <span id="s1672">And when they caught them, they had latches and they had this bench you had to bend over like a table, and lots of hangings, lots of hangings.</span> <span id="s1673">As you may notice I haven't gotten into any of the gory things about brothers had to hang brothers if they knew it, and lots of beatings right in front of the prisoners when there was roll call.</span> <span id="s1674">Daily almost.</span> <span id="s1675">Findings ways to keep your mind -- a lot of beatings, a lot of hangings.</span> <span id="s1676">Not so much shootings.</span></p> <p><span id="s1677">Shooting was only when they started running.</span> <span id="s1678">And they tempted you constantly by throwing a cigarette butt out and if you were dumb enough to run after that you were dead.</span> <span id="s1679">But lots of hangings.</span> <span id="s1680">And then they brought in next to us a camp with women, with 30, 40 women.</span> <span id="s1681">And they used them to do their kitchen work and I think administration.</span> <span id="s1682">And they have used these women.</span></p> <p><span id="s1683">Q: What do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1684">A: They used them as prostitutes.</span> <span id="s1685">They are mostly -- they were Czech, some Hungarians and some -- Jewish girls, all young.</span> <span id="s1686">They killed them at the tail end.</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">Q: How did you find out about them?</span> <span id="s1688">A: We saw it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">Q: You saw it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">A: They were right parallel to our camp.</span> <span id="s1691">Q: So you could see them being raped?</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">A: No, we did not, but we knew it.</span> <span id="s1693">At night we used to sometimes be able to talk over the wire a little bit.</span> <span id="s1694">It was very dangerous to do it.</span> <span id="s1695">But one of our buddies was an electrician, was the camp electrician, he was from Berlin, and he used to arrange there was a short sometimes so we could toss some food to the girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s1696">Q: And so the women would tell?</span></p> <p><span id="s1697">A: Then they would tell the stories.</span> <span id="s1698">And in the kitchen, you know, they did work in the kitchen so we had contact with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1699">Q: So this must have been very shocking.</span></p> <p><span id="s1700">A: Yes, well, there's nothing shocking that we saw.</span> <span id="s1701">Then I worked -- from there I worked on the railroad yards in the town.</span> <span id="s1702">I think it was Kaufering, I'm almost sure on the railroad yards there, to do the loading and unloading.</span> <span id="s1703">And there was one guard he said to me, he found out I spoke German, and he gave me, he says I want you to listen to this, he says, if it gets very difficult to go and take off and go to this address.</span> <span id="s1704">Which on the surface sounds very benevolent and I should have maybe done that, but I didn't trust him.</span> <span id="s1705">So I said "Danke schön."</span> <span id="s1706">I thanked him.</span> <span id="s1707">I didn't take that chance.</span> <span id="s1708">We were so mentally programmed that we couldn't trust them.</span> <span id="s1709">I couldn't true.</span> <span id="s1710">And this may have been a sincere person, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1711">I saw him every day at the railroad cars where I worked and he said that to me.</span> <span id="s1712">Because he asked, he said does anybody here speak German, so I put my hand up.</span> <span id="s1713">And after maybe a couple of weeks he saw the same face and I saw the same face and he said that to me.</span> <span id="s1714">I didn't trust him, I didn't do it.</span> <span id="s1715">I wish I had done it a few weeks later when we were on another death march.</span></p> <p><span id="s1716">Q: To where?</span></p> <p><span id="s1717">A: From that camp back to Dachau.</span> <span id="s1718">It was in the last week of April.</span> <span id="s1719">We marked and we marched and we marched and a lot of boys got killed.</span> <span id="s1720">And then one night they had us on some farm I think it was, and the Germans, part of their troops had already deserted, the Germans, and they were scared for us, but we didn't know that, but in retrospect I can figure this.</span> <span id="s1721">They said to us, look you all behave now, everything is fine, we are instructed to take you to near the Swiss border.</span> <span id="s1722">We had no idea where we were.</span> <span id="s1723">We are near the Swiss border and we are taking you by orders of the International Red Cross over the Swiss border tomorrow morning.</span> <span id="s1724">And I remember that night when they told us that, we all started crying of joy.</span> <span id="s1725">We were free.</span> <span id="s1726">They told us you are free.</span> <span id="s1727">I remember distinctly, very distinctly, you are free but don't run away because you'll be better off if you stay with us because you are going to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1728">To us this was of course the beginning of a new life.</span> <span id="s1729">And we stood there and cried.</span> <span id="s1730">I remember that.</span> <span id="s1731">And especially one friend who was from Brussels.</span> <span id="s1732">By that time I had made some friends.</span> <span id="s1733">We had been together for a long time.</span> <span id="s1734">We stood there and cried and cried.</span> <span id="s1735">And then morning came and we started marching believing we were going to the Swiss border and before we knew it we were in Dachau.</span> <span id="s1736">The gate closed and it was Allach really which was a side camp of Dachau.</span> <span id="s1737">So we were back behind the wires.</span> <span id="s1738">And then within a few days we saw the Americans come in, on the 30th of April that morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s1739">Then they came over the little hill and we had to tell them we could walk, I could walk.</span> <span id="s1740">We could tell them and others could took.</span> <span id="s1741">There were a lot of non Jewish prisoners there, political prisoners, Dutch, French, Belgium, Poles, mostly Western Europeans.</span> <span id="s1742">And they had to tell the Americans not to touch the wires, they were under high tension.</span> <span id="s1743">But the night, the last night in that camp, the night of the 29th and the 30th there was a bombardment in that camp.</span> <span id="s1744">The Germans had for some reasons -- batteries around that camp, that I remember seeing, and the turned those batteries into the camp that night.</span> <span id="s1745">They killed a lot of kids, a lot of people, mostly Jews.</span> <span id="s1746">They turned to the Jewish part of the camp.</span> <span id="s1747">The Jews were separate from the Christians.</span> <span id="s1748">And they put their guns, aircraft guns go on an angle towards the sky and they put right through, straight out, horizontal into the camp and killed a lot of our people the last night.</span> <span id="s1749">And then the next morning the Americans came and they had to get the engineers to take the wires and the electricity off the wires, and we were liberated.</span> <span id="s1750">And the picture you see that we use at the museum, that liberation picture, I'm in that picture.</span> <span id="s1751">I think I know who it is.</span> <span id="s1752">I think I know who it is, that person that I see there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1753">Q: We are running out of tape, I'm afraid.</span> <span id="s1754">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1755">Q: So what I would like to do is have them -- can you stop the tape for a moment so that we can get this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1756">A: Let me take the watch off.</span> <span id="s1757">They too, my bar mitzvah watch.</span> <span id="s1758">Q: Would you like to stand up?</span></p> <p><span id="s1759">A: That's as close in as I can get.</span> <span id="s1760">Q: Yes, that's good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1761">A: Can you read it?</span> <span id="s1762">What are you reading?</span> <span id="s1763">Q: 145342.</span></p> <p><span id="s1764">A: 382.</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">Q: 382.</span> <span id="s1766">We had numbers in Dachau too, but they weren't tattooed on.</span> <span id="s1767">They had numbers in every camp.</span> <span id="s1768">This is only Birkenau.</span> <span id="s1769">Can I take my arm down?</span></p> <p><span id="s1770">Q: Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1771">A: All right.</span> <span id="s1772">I made it very easy for myself, I didn't go into any emotion.</span> <span id="s1773">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1774">A: Why?</span> <span id="s1775">Because it's hard to explain it.</span> <span id="s1776">I don't remember how I felt.</span> <span id="s1777">I know one thing, I felt very lonesome and very angry and like crying.</span> <span id="s1778">I always remember that when I saw my parents go to the gas chamber I couldn't cry, I was so hardened already.</span> <span id="s1779">See, but then I'm very grateful because I'm not that hateful.</span> <span id="s1780">I just put it out of my mind.</span> <span id="s1781">When I think about it, I pick up a book.</span> <span id="s1782">I don't want to think about it.</span> <span id="s1783">I read.</span> <span id="s1784">I've done that ever since '45.</span> <span id="s1785">If it starts to come into my mind, I pick up a book real fast.</span> <span id="s1786">That's the only way I can survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1787">Q: Well, thank you for being here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1788">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1789">I think we got everything.</span> <span id="s1790">The liberation we got in here.</span> <span id="s1791">Q: We didn't go afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s1792">A: Yes, the liberation.</span> <span id="s1793">Then I went back to Holland, you know that, which is unimportant.</span> <span id="s1794">Q: Okay.</span></p></body></html>
