Tell me about your...your family.</span> <span id="s32">Um, did you have brothers and sisters?</span> <span id="s33">What did you do during the day?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s35">I was the fourth of six children.</span> <span id="s36">And because of the fact that the violin, I was exposed that early... Of course, these Gypsies returned me to my family after they found out whom I belonged to.</span> <span id="s37">And...uh...we were...I was actually three.</span> <span id="s38">It's very strange--probably unbelievable--but in three...at three years old I was when I started to learn the Hebrew alphabet.</span> <span id="s39">When I was five, I could read it very well.</span> <span id="s40">And the everyday's life was actually studying and...uh...lot of...lot of praying at the time, as usual.</span> <span id="s41">And, of course, one other thing.</span> <span id="s42">Uh...The area where we lived in Transylvania, the city called I.G. Duca--I.G. Duca, that was given after a assassinated Romanian president.And...uh...they were not very friendly to Jews.</span> <span id="s43">And at the time it was not that severe as it came later on.</span> <span id="s44">So, we were restricted.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">However, we went to school.</span> <span id="s46">And ...uh...every one of my brothers and sisters--we were two sisters and four brothers.</span> <span id="s47">And...uh...we were allowed to...to go to school and learn like everybody else.</span> <span id="s48">However, we would be hearing here and there that we are a Jew, or occasionally that we were "Christ-killers.”</span> <span id="s49">And that restricted us.</span> <span id="s50">Of course, certain places 1 The original name of the town was Székely-Keresztúr (Hung), or Criturul-Secuiesc (Rom).</span> <span id="s51">The name was changed sometime in the 1930s, in honor of the slain Romanian leader Ion G. Duca.</span> <span id="s52">(Information from telephone conversation with Shony Alex Braun, 25 Jul 1991).</span></p> <p><span id="s53">we could not join.</span> <span id="s54">Like we children would have loved to be a part of this club or that club where other children were, but we were not allowed to.</span> <span id="s55">And this... this is how our everyday lifes went.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: When did you start to learn the violin?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: Uh, about a year later.</span> <span id="s58">As...as I mentioned, I was four when I got exposed by the Gypsies.</span> <span id="s59">And these were very nice people, by the way.</span> <span id="s60">Uh, a year later, my parents found a small violin.</span> <span id="s61">Due to the fact that there wasn't a day going by that I would not be begging my parents, "I want this!</span> <span id="s62">I want this!"</span> <span id="s63">I couldn't even say "hegedü"--that's Hungarian name for the violin.</span> <span id="s64">So finally, they gave in.</span> <span id="s65">And exactly that, to be exact July 14, which was my birthday, they...uh, at age five, they finally presented me with a violin.</span> <span id="s66">And I was not allowed to hold, actually, to...uh play with that; only and strictly with a teacher.</span> <span id="s67">Because my father, I'm sure that he knew, and so did my mother, that if I had just gotten on and I would have played and maybe got frustrated trying alone to get a tune here and there what I heard from the Gypsies, from bird imitations and God knows what else.</span> <span id="s68">So I would have been just dropping it.</span> <span id="s69">But no, it was with a teacher from the beginning on.</span> <span id="s70">And would you believe that not once I had to be told to practice.</span> <span id="s71">In fact, just the opposite happened.</span> <span id="s72">My mother, for instance, would tell my father, "Just tell him to go out and play outside, and go on the sun.</span> <span id="s73">Look how pale he is!</span> <span id="s74">He's...he's practicing too much.</span> <span id="s75">And he's not going with some of the other children out.”</span> <span id="s76">You know.</span> <span id="s77">And so this is really strange, because most children has to be told...have to be told, "Practice!"</span> <span id="s78">But not me.</span> <span id="s79">I loved it from the start.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: Tell us where that took you, as...as a young child.</span> <span id="s81">What did you end up doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: When...uh... I really honestly have to tell you this.</span> <span id="s83">This is only to share with you.</span> <span id="s84">I'm not trying to impress anyone.</span> <span id="s85">But...uh...I progressed rapidly.</span> <span id="s86">Was due to the fact probably that I loved it so much; and also, of course, that I was born with a good musical ear.</span> <span id="s87">And...uh...by the time I was 11, I enrolled to a nearby conservatory, nearby our city, maybe...uh ...60 kilometers--which was probably less than 30 miles away.And I was one of the very few student that was admitted.</span> <span id="s88">Now at that time really to be admitted in that school and to that specific teacher, you really had to be...uh...very tops.</span> <span id="s89">Because Jews were only admitted a certain percentage; and then you had to be playing or knowing or...or being twice or three times as good as your other friends who were not Jewish, you know?</span> <span id="s90">And...uh...it happened that I got a scholarship with this man.</span> <span id="s91">And with age...up to age 13, where I graduated the conservatory.</span> <span id="s92">And then I got another scholarship at that point... If I may mention--at that point, we were already instead of being Romania... Of course, in 1940 when I was 10 years old, just to back up a little, then a..</span> <span id="s93">.</span> <span id="s94">a major change occurred when unfortunately Hitler invaded or came into Hungary and...uh...actually came to Transylvania, and then forced the Romanian to give a part of Transylvania back to Hungary.</span> <span id="s95">The Hungarians claimed they 2 This was in Tîrgu-MureÕ (also: Târgu-MureÕ).</span> <span id="s96">The same city is also known by the Hungarian name of Maros-Vásárhely.</span> <span id="s97">(Information from telephone conversation with Shony Alex Braun, 25 Jul 1991).</span></p> <p><span id="s98">were always theirs; and the Romanian, of course, argued that it was not so.</span> <span id="s99">And so now we, instead of being Romanian, we became Hungarian citizens.</span> <span id="s100">But then the problem was more more severe for the Jews.</span> <span id="s101">Slowly, we were thrown out of schools.</span> <span id="s102">I was an exceptional...uh...person as far as the Hungarians concerned, with...with their law; because while I was in that--it was not a city, a small town--I would be playing for the...uh... police, giving a concert as a youngster.</span> <span id="s103">Or for the fireman's ball; they would feature me before anything, with a solo or so.</span> <span id="s104">So because I did so many charitable things in that city... Like the poor people--at Christmas time, they would be asking an Orthodox Jew... But still, it was no difference, you know, as far as... When you can do something good, then you do it.</span> <span id="s105">And, uh...so we...I was actually allowed because of that, it really came...uh, to my...to my rescue as far as not being thrown out of the school immediately.</span> <span id="s106">So there were very few percentage of the Jews...uh, Jewish children that they were allowed to...be made exception.</span> <span id="s107">And I was one of them they made an exception to the rule.</span> <span id="s108">So I was allowed to continue, up 'til one dreadful morning in May 1944.</span> <span id="s109">That's where the Hungarian gendarme--small town police-- was banging on the door in our home...at our home, and said, "We give you one hour to gather some belongings.</span> <span id="s110">For instance, pots and pans and the clothes on your back and some blankets.</span> <span id="s111">One hour.”</span> <span id="s112">And they herded us into an apartment complex in the back yard of.</span> <span id="s113">And they was incredible.</span> <span id="s114">You...you wondering what's going on.</span> <span id="s115">And for us children, we couldn't...we couldn't comprehend.</span> <span id="s116">Why...why they doing that?</span> <span id="s117">In fact, before this came to pass, uh...I like to mention that laws came.</span> <span id="s118">For instance, Jews were not allowed to go out without yellow star.</span> <span id="s119">And that brought even more antisemitism by the...some adults and the mostly, of course, younger children or teenagers.</span> <span id="s120">They would be spitting at us.</span> <span id="s121">They would be throwing stones at us.</span> <span id="s122">Sometimes I would be cornered by going from one place to the other in...or I would be on the street and beaten up.</span> <span id="s123">And sometimes...uh, they would be torn ...uh, the...the... What do you call it?</span> <span id="s124">The coat off my back; and just left there, you know, practically almost with nothing on me.</span> <span id="s125">To which...to shame me, because I was a Jew.</span> <span id="s126">And we would be called "Christ-killers.”</span> <span id="s127">It was...it was impossible to comprehend that the same person who "yesterday" was playing with me--gentiles--today he would be beating me up and calling me "Christ-killer.”</span> <span id="s128">So that day...</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: What... Tell me a little more about those years.</span> <span id="s130">You were very young.</span> <span id="s131">Uh, what...what...what else was your family doing during these years of occupation?</span> <span id="s132">What was life like in the ghetto for them?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: We...we actually...uh...started, as I have mentioned, in 1940 until 1944.</span> <span id="s134">Uh, periodically, it was very, very difficult.</span> <span id="s135">For instance, my father--who was an Orthodox Jew--naturally wouldn't ever be open, or the store, on Saturday.</span> <span id="s136">They forced us to open.</span> <span id="s137">That was only to...uh...to make you do something which is against your conviction, against your religious beliefs.</span> <span id="s138">And they were--the gendarme, the so-called police who I mentioned--would be there, make sure that he opened every Saturday.</span> <span id="s139">So that...and he would be sitting there in the store.</span> <span id="s140">And we...we would be...uh...restricted from many things.</span> <span id="s141">Jews were not allowed, of course, later on, to be on the street from a certain time on.</span> <span id="s142">If you caught on the street from...let's say from 6:00 on, you would be imprison and beaten up by the police.</span> <span id="s143">Not only...of course, it was very dangerous to...to walk on the...on the street at that hour; because not only that the police would be getting at you, but the people that they lived there.</span> <span id="s144">I must tell you honestly, not every one of them were anti-Semites.</span> <span id="s145">For instance, there was a..</span> <span id="s146">.</span> <span id="s147">must, for the sake of truth, must mention it.</span> <span id="s148">Was very strange though.</span> <span id="s149">Was...uh, a friend of my father, a German who was bank director.</span> <span id="s150">And he would be giving my father helpful hints.</span> <span id="s151">Uh, for instance, like he foresee what's going to happen.</span> <span id="s152">He foresee it.</span> <span id="s153">Because he had informations, because he was a German.</span> <span id="s154">But instead of keeping quiet, he would come to my father and would say, for instance, "Listen, you having minor children.</span> <span id="s155">Why don't you falsify their birth certificate?</span> <span id="s156">Make them older.</span> <span id="s157">Just in case if something happens, then...uh...they are old enough to work.</span> <span id="s158">Rather than something will happen to them.”</span> <span id="s159">And my father knew quite a bit in advance, but he would never tell us or not even to my mother.</span> <span id="s160">So we would not make them...not scare them, you know, or us.</span> <span id="s161">My parents were fantastic, I tell you.</span> <span id="s162">My father was just a genius in many, many different... Even in medicine, which is actually what he studied to begin with.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">But then war, speaking of the other war, came; and he had to do something different.</span> <span id="s164">So he became a jeweler.</span> <span id="s165">It's a wonderful thing to be.</span> <span id="s166">So this was...uh, actually the life during the occupation, as far as the Hungarians came.</span> <span id="s167">Now from...at that time, if I may continue, from that time on, when we were herded into that apartment complex and were about 200 or more Jews gathered from all kind of a directions--not only from thats...uh, town, but from neighboring towns.</span> <span id="s168">We were there.</span> <span id="s169">We were outside.</span> <span id="s170">We had our absolutely no...nothing to lay on.</span> <span id="s171">For instance, we...we were in the back yard and on the grass, and it was still wet.</span> <span id="s172">And sometimes it complicated things when...when was raining.</span> <span id="s173">We were absolutely out in the open.</span> <span id="s174">Kept there, and soaking wet, with very little to eat.</span> <span id="s175">What we brought, gathered in that one hour which I mentioned when the police banged on our door.</span> <span id="s176">Everything we were stripped of.</span> <span id="s177">The only thing, as I mentioned, we were allowed to be taken the clothes which we had on, a blanket and some pots and pans.</span> <span id="s178">Now from that place about three or four days later, when enough Jews were gathered, we were put on horse-drawn carts and we were taken into a brick factory nearby.</span> <span id="s179">And they were thousands of Jews gathered, their families; and the...the condition was incredible.</span> <span id="s180">For instance, now they...they had...the first time in my life I have seen SS guards and officers in that town.</span> <span id="s181">In fact, the sad thing about it is that's was the town where I went and studied in conservatory, when it was so wonderful that I would be allowed to be one of those Jews and having a scholarship.</span> <span id="s182">Now the very same town, I am imprisoned and encaptured--captured, I mean--in that brick factory.</span> <span id="s183">This also when it rained there was nothing, absolutely nothing, to cover us.</span> <span id="s184">Not...not very long after--we were there about a week, I would say maybe roughly speaking--and some other terrible thing happened.</span> <span id="s185">My two older brothers were drafted by the Hungarian Army as what they called "forced laborer.”</span> <span id="s186">And it came the news that they were sent in the front.</span> <span id="s187">You know, this is what they did.</span> <span id="s188">The...the SS did the same thing, as well as the Hungarians.</span> <span id="s189">They sent the Jewish forced laborer... they, they wore armband and the star, but they went ahead of the...of the soldiers, of the Hungarian or German soldiers, and so that if they were mined ahead of them.</span> <span id="s190">So wherever the territory was mined, they would be stepping on it, would be blown up-- (cough) excuse me--and not the...not the Army.</span> <span id="s191">And word came.</span> <span id="s192">And you imagine now this.</span> <span id="s193">I was a 13 year old, not quite 14, at that time.</span> <span id="s194">And somehow I intercepted that letter which came to the ghetto that my two brothers--the older brothers, Adolph and Emil--were both perished.</span> <span id="s195">They were both blown to pieces by one of these mines...one of these mines, that were under...you know, undermined.</span> <span id="s196">And I kept that terrible secret 'til liberation because I would never tell my father nor my mother.</span> <span id="s197">Nor would I tell my sister, was still there.</span> <span id="s198">Uh, my older sister was...uh...with us at the time.</span> <span id="s199">Was only the two...when the family was taken from home, my old...two older brothers were already forced laborer...taken as forced laborer.</span> <span id="s200">And that terrible knowledge that I couldn't share with anyone.</span> <span id="s201">And I begged the person who brought the letter, actually, the notification, not to say a word to anyone.</span> <span id="s202">And I don't know how did he...he got...uh...uh, that knowledge.</span> <span id="s203">I don't know.</span> <span id="s204">It came...uh...through the mail, it came from the Red Cross, or whatever it was the case.</span> <span id="s205">Because somebody else from his family was blown up; and so were the Braun brothers, my two brothers.</span> <span id="s206">And I would not tell.</span> <span id="s207">But to keep that awful things within me, it was terrible.</span> <span id="s208">So being in that...in that ghetto, we had very little to eat.</span> <span id="s209">Very, very little.</span> <span id="s210">And something happened.</span> <span id="s211">The SS would be building outside in the open, within that the frame of the brick factory, latrinas.</span> <span id="s212">And would...I as, well...you know, when.</span> <span id="s213">.</span> <span id="s214">when you privacy when you...when you have to...uh, when...when nature calls you.</span> <span id="s215">And...uh, I would have never ever even dreamed to do anything in presence of...of somebody who's not only is a stranger, not even friends.</span> <span id="s216">In fact, even our parents, let's say, we would be not exposing ourselves openly.</span> <span id="s217">That's somehow strange, but that's the way it was.</span> <span id="s218">It...it took 5, 10...maybe 5 to 10 days being in that.</span> <span id="s219">It's very, very unbelievable; but it's true.</span> <span id="s220">I couldn't possibly ...uh, do what...what nature calls.</span> <span id="s221">And that...that caused a terrible problem, because we were in the open.</span> <span id="s222">And I noticed when women and men, they...right in the open.</span> <span id="s223">And then the SS would come and take pictures of us; and they would be laughing and...and enjoying that terrible shame that we had, to do our duties in the open and during the day.</span> <span id="s224">At least, if it was nights or darkness...you know?</span> <span id="s225">But it...it just terrible.</span> <span id="s226">Now, one day they gathered us again and took us out to the train station, and they said we have to go.</span> <span id="s227">I noticed the train with cattle cars.</span> <span id="s228">Now, there were also no facilities where one can go to the bathroom, if that's the way you want to call it, you know.</span> <span id="s229">And what...strange thing happened that we...some of us, refused to board the train.</span> <span id="s230">And the SS said, "We're going to kill you if you're not going to board the train.”</span> <span id="s231">So some people threw themselves down to the ground.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">And the SS went and at random took some children and some women, some older people; and they lined up and just shot them at random.</span> <span id="s233">Just shot them dead.</span> <span id="s234">That, of course, scared the rest of us.</span> <span id="s235">So what we did, in order... For them, life was absolutely nothing.</span> <span id="s236">Like you stepping on an ant, even less.</span> <span id="s237">But--(coughing) excuse me--they want to...want to show to the rest of us terror.</span> <span id="s238">Always that SS terror, you know; with that fear and terror that we would be mindlessly following what they ordered us to do.</span> <span id="s239">And we...we boarded the train.</span> <span id="s240">And I can tell you, the worst thing yet to come, in that specific cattle car was no sanitation facilities.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Was no air, no water; and a very, very rare occasion the train would be stopping and then they would allow some people to get off the train.</span> <span id="s242">Some.</span> <span id="s243">And mostly... uh, older people, maybe sometimes they allowed them.</span> <span id="s244">What happened, if they didn't come back soon enough, they would just shoot them like dogs.</span> <span id="s245">And now, at the next stop when it was, then people were afraid to get off.</span> <span id="s246">They would say, "Whoever wants to get out, you can get off.”</span> <span id="s247">Yah, but when you get off, you knew that you gonna be shot if you're not gonna be back.</span> <span id="s248">"Los!</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Los!"</span> <span id="s250">You were not fast enough, they just shoot you and left you right there.</span> <span id="s251">When we arrived a few days later... Now in the cattle cars, there were a lot of older people and children.</span> <span id="s252">They couldn't stand the heat.</span> <span id="s253">They couldn't stand the...the terrible scent, or... Or what do you call it?</span> <span id="s254">That's the terrible smell.</span> <span id="s255">And we have to do our duties right in there.</span> <span id="s256">So, many of them died right in the car as we went.</span> <span id="s257">We...we didn't know then, but we were going destination Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s258">When we arrived to Auschwitz, we were not allowed out of the car...off the train yet.</span> <span id="s259">They were holding us for quite some time.</span> <span id="s260">Hours and hours, and during the night and during the day.</span> <span id="s261">When finally the...the car door...the car door opened, we were ordered out.</span> <span id="s262">As soon as we stepped out, head prisoners--called kapos--SS guards, rushed toward us.</span> <span id="s263">Started kicking, hitting, punching and using the whips anyone they could reach.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">They ordered us to get in line.</span> <span id="s265">While we...we were doing that, because we were not fast enough, the kicking and the punching continued, and the whipping.</span> <span id="s266">When we lined up, I noticed that an SS officer approached us.</span> <span id="s267">It was the infamous Dr. Josef Mengele.</span> <span id="s268">And ...uh, that was the man who decide our fate.</span> <span id="s269">Instant death in a gas chamber, or lingering life of torture and slavery.</span> <span id="s270">And what was interesting, I noticed--specifically for me was noticeable-- because actually he was holding a slender stick in his hand and which was a conductor's baton.</span> <span id="s271">And we were ordered to file by him; and as we would be passing him or filing by him, he would be motion to the left or to the right.</span> <span id="s272">My mother and my younger sister were motioned to the left.</span> <span id="s273">My older sister... By the way, my younger sister was 9 years old.</span> <span id="s274">She was made...she had a certificate falsified, trumped up to be 12.</span> <span id="s275">But Mengele just looked at her and my mother, and just motioned them on one side.</span> <span id="s276">Now, my older sister--who was 18-- she was motioned to the other side.</span> <span id="s277">My father and my older brother--older than I--they were also motioned to the side where my sister--whose name was Violet, "Ibolya" in Hungarian-- they were motioned to that side.</span> <span id="s278">When my turn came, to...to my...to my great surprise, Mengele motioned me to stop, gestured me to stop.</span> <span id="s279">And says--sweetly, like a father--says, "How old are...how old are you, little boy?"</span> <span id="s280">And I said, "I am 16!"</span> <span id="s281">And he looked at me suspiciously, and then he motioned me to the same side where my father and older brother and older sister was.</span> <span id="s282">Now the reason, and that was where that--remember I mentioned earlier that...that...uh, bank director, the German who coached my father.</span> <span id="s283">And, in fact, I said, "I am 16, and I can prove it too.”</span> <span id="s284">And I had it in my...in my jacket there; but...but he just looked at me like with a very strange smile.</span> <span id="s285">Probably what it said, he knew I was...I was no 16, because I didn't look even...even 13, or almost 14, by the way.</span> <span id="s286">You know, but he probably said to himself--this is only my guessing--that, "You regret the fact that you lied to me.</span> <span id="s287">I let you live, but you regret it.”</span> <span id="s288">You know?</span> <span id="s289">However, I was safe for the time being.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: Stop here.</span> <span id="s291">We need to change tapes, please.</span> <span id="s292">Very quickly.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">3 He is referring here to his brother Zoltan, who was actually 11 months his junior, but who appeared older.</span> <span id="s294">During the war, Zoltan's age was also faked on written records so that he became "older" than Shony.</span> <span id="s295">(Information from telephone conversation with Shony Braun, 25 Jul 1991).</span></p> <p><span id="s296">TAPE #2</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s298">Let's go on.</span> <span id="s299">Mengele... Just repeat it after me.</span> <span id="s300">Mengele had motioned you to the right, and then what?</span> <span id="s301">Where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: When uh Mengele motioned to me to the right, of course, I went immediately into the group where my father and my older brother were.</span> <span id="s303">Because then they would be separating men and women.</span> <span id="s304">And we were taken to a building where we were stripped from everything now, even what we had on our back.</span> <span id="s305">Every... everything we had to leave.</span> <span id="s306">And we were shaven, and everywhere where you can imagine.</span> <span id="s307">And then later on, we were issued these prisoners'...uh...uniform, and assigned to a barrack.</span> <span id="s308">A few days later, while we were... Every single day we would be counted.</span> <span id="s309">Counted, so God forbid if somebody would not escape, you know.</span> <span id="s310">And, of course, we had very little to eat.</span> <span id="s311">We had some kind of a very questionable jelly kind of a thick substance in a bowl; and each...only one sip we were allowed to take.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">And that bowl would be passed over the line of five; and each...each group, you know, in each line for five.</span> <span id="s313">And then behind the five.</span> <span id="s314">So you had to pass it over to the other person.</span> <span id="s315">One swallow of it.</span> <span id="s316">If not, you were...you were beaten.</span> <span id="s317">And they would be head prisoners-- called kapos--who would be watching you, as well as the SS guards.</span> <span id="s318">Now, you know, you couldn't possibly sip yourself full of anything, because one sip; and if you were lucky, then it might got back to you to have another sip.</span> <span id="s319">So we were assigned to a barrack.</span> <span id="s320">One night, as I was standing in line to be counted, a kapo came.</span> <span id="s321">The head prisoners--and let's refer from now on as...as kapo.</span> <span id="s322">Came to our line where I was standing, and picked prisoners at random for what they called it "Sonderkommando"--a special commando.</span> <span id="s323">And that meant now separation; because we somehow managed to stay, my father and my brother and myself, stay in one barrack together.</span> <span id="s324">At least we were together.</span> <span id="s325">And...uh, now that meant separation.</span> <span id="s326">And my job--our job, for the Sonderkommando--was to go around the camp and pick up dead or nearly dead bodies, put them on a cart and cart them or push them up to the crematoria where another group of people, Sonderkommandos, would take over and they would shove them in...to the oven.</span> <span id="s327">Some of these people were far from being dead.</span> <span id="s328">They were just helpless, very ill or dehydrated of... or...or from hunger.</span> <span id="s329">They just didn't have any more... uh, power even to stand.</span> <span id="s330">So they fell.</span> <span id="s331">Now, they were left there; and now we were sent to pick them up, as I mentioned, put them on a cart and push them in a crematorium.</span> <span id="s332">On one occasion, I went to the kapo and I said, "This man is not dead!"</span> <span id="s333">I get a..</span> <span id="s334">.</span> <span id="s335">such a terrible slap in a face that I made a somersault.</span> <span id="s336">I was a little boy, anyway.</span> <span id="s337">And he says, "You were not supposed to think or say anything!</span> <span id="s338">Your job is to pick them up and put them on a cart and shove them up to the crematorium, just as you were told.”</span> <span id="s339">Now from that time on, there was nothing I could do.</span> <span id="s340">Just pick them up, as he said, with four or six of us, in fact, many cases...occasions.</span> <span id="s341">Believe it or not, I have a picture.</span> <span id="s342">I couldn't find it, momentarily.</span> <span id="s343">I..</span> <span id="s344">.</span> <span id="s345">I would have...if I find it, I give it to you; because I know that the Holocaust Museum would love it.</span> <span id="s346">But it was...it's not the one that I worked.</span> <span id="s347">However, an eyewitness who went... I just venture away from the subject.</span> <span id="s348">You may find it interesting.</span> <span id="s349">An eyewitness went after the war, or he was one of the liberator.</span> <span id="s350">He found...he took pictures of one of these carts.</span> <span id="s351">And he...it was in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s352">And he took it; and when...when I met him not long ago--only four, five years ago, I think it was.</span> <span id="s353">Either in Annapolis, or Austin, Texas.</span> <span id="s354">One or the other.</span> <span id="s355">Where I performed.</span> <span id="s356">He presented it to me, when I told him the story that I was... unfortunately, this what I had to do.</span> <span id="s357">So back to the story.</span> <span id="s358">I..</span> <span id="s359">.</span> <span id="s360">I would be working about six days in that Sonderkommando.</span> <span id="s361">You cannot imagine.</span> <span id="s362">I tell you, the most awful things.</span> <span id="s363">Some of these people, they were left for days.</span> <span id="s364">Not only the smell, there were flies on it.</span> <span id="s365">And they...they...the flesh was starting to rotten.</span> <span id="s366">It's heat, you know.</span> <span id="s367">And...uh...we're talking about end of May, and...uh...beginning of June [1944].</span> <span id="s368">And they...they were put some...some other Sonderkommando went and would spray some kind of a material on it, so as to disinfect them.</span> <span id="s369">But that was (laughing) ...you know, made it look even worse.</span> <span id="s370">So as I mentioned, about six or seven days I was working.</span> <span id="s371">Now in that Sonderkommando was a man who would be about the same years old as my father was--about 41, 42.</span> <span id="s372">And he had a son who was maybe about a year or two older than I. And word came to this Kommando--that...that was the father, who also got torn away from his son.</span> <span id="s373">And word came that the barrack which my father and brother were, next day going to be transferred to France.</span> <span id="s374">And he--the wise and ingenious plan.</span> <span id="s375">He says, "In the evening, when we prisoners are rushed, really beaten to group, 'Get into line!</span> <span id="s376">Fast!</span> <span id="s377">Fast!</span> <span id="s378">Antreten, und so weiter!</span> <span id="s379">[Ger: "Line up, and so on"]' And so on.</span> <span id="s380">When we're running, my son...I going... Somehow, I'm going to let him...my son is going to run in that barrack.</span> <span id="s381">And you should run and stay in line with...with your father's barrack.”</span> <span id="s382">And nobody's the wiser, because we were only numbers.</span> <span id="s383">We had no names.</span> <span id="s384">We're numbers.</span> <span id="s385">He said, "Surely, you wanted to be with your father and brother.</span> <span id="s386">And I want my son.”</span> <span id="s387">And I said, "Oh, yes!</span> <span id="s388">Oh, what a wonderful thing.”</span> <span id="s389">And it worked.</span> <span id="s390">It worked.</span> <span id="s391">I got to be together again with my family...which was left from my family.</span> <span id="s392">And he got his son.</span> <span id="s393">Now, at this point, I must say that when...when my mother and...uh, little sister... Back in...in...still in Auschwitz, when they...when the selections were over, and Mengele sent them to the right or to the left; remember they did sent them to the left, my mother and small sister.</span> <span id="s394">When the selection was complete...or were complete, they were taken direct to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s395">And they can...I'm sorry that I'm...I'm going back, but I..</span> <span id="s396">.</span> <span id="s397">for the sake of...of the truth... They were given by...by the SS, a towel and a piece of soap.</span> <span id="s398">And it was in a..</span> <span id="s399">in a building written "Bade"--means "Bath.”</span> <span id="s400">And they were told that they going to go in to take showers.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Camouflaged the fact... See, that the SS didn't want uprising, they didn't want wailings and crying, and what have you.</span> <span id="s402">They were said, "No, no.</span> <span id="s403">Nothing's going to happen to you.</span> <span id="s404">Just go in and take showers.”</span> <span id="s405">Once they entered into that large room and the door was locked, they would let gas in there.</span> <span id="s406">Now, what the terrible thing was in... One of the...one of the lucky thing, in a way, for me...the terrible thing was they would be dead.</span> <span id="s407">Of course, they would be stark naked.</span> <span id="s408">They would be sending us to go and pick up the dead bodies who they just gassed, and...and cart them up to the crematoria.</span> <span id="s409">My...as I said, lucky for me, was that I was not the one at the time who belonged to the Sonderkommando.</span> <span id="s410">Because, I assure you, I would have killed myself right then and there.</span> <span id="s411">I could not see my mother being...and my sister being in that condition and...and killed, and then I would go on living.</span> <span id="s412">I couldn't survive it.</span> <span id="s413">Now, back when the Sonderkommando--other words, they were reunited.</span> <span id="s414">And my father and my brother, as I mentioned it, and I, were reunited.</span> <span id="s415">We were reunited and off to France.</span> <span id="s416">While we were going, one of the prisoner... I..</span> <span id="s417">.</span> <span id="s418">I told him, I said, "You know it's a terrible what's happened.”</span> <span id="s419">I was telling, of course, in my very low key while we were going.</span> <span id="s420">I was saying, "It's terrible.”</span> <span id="s421">I says, "I picked up dead bodies, and they...they...some of them were not dead at all.</span> <span id="s422">And if they would be attended, they would be healthy.</span> <span id="s423">They could have been made better, you know, cured them.”</span> <span id="s424">The illness was only give more food and water.</span> <span id="s425">At any rate, he says, "Well, how long did you work in that Sonderkommando?"</span> <span id="s426">I said, "There were seven days that I worked.”</span> <span id="s427">He says, "That was your last day, my dear.”</span> <span id="s428">Says, "Next day, you and all the other Sonderkommando...uh...people would be burned, and new ones would be selected.”</span> <span id="s429">They did not keep them but six or seven days.</span> <span id="s430">By...by a chance of...of... How else can I say but miracle?</span> <span id="s431">That if it would not be the fact from that father wanted his son... He didn't know either.</span> <span id="s432">But what was...the point was, as I was told later on, that the SS feared just by chance if someone would escape, by chance, and could tell the world the atrocities that they were doing.</span> <span id="s433">'Cause these people were burned alive.</span> <span id="s434">I mean, they were not at all dead.</span> <span id="s435">Most of them.</span> <span id="s436">Now in France, something happened that I am going to cherish, even it was dangerous and almost got shot to death.</span> <span id="s437">But I'll share this with you.</span> <span id="s438">I got to...uh...when we arrived, I was put...I was put in a ammunition factory.And first...first three days, I was cutting parts.</span> <span id="s439">Certain parts to certain weapons.</span> <span id="s440">And then I was put to.</span> <span id="s441">.</span> <span id="s442">put...I was put next to a machine, or to a machine, where I was filling up capsules with gunpowder.</span> <span id="s443">And that was for a secret weapon.</span> <span id="s444">Now we did not know that, and I found out only after liberation.</span> <span id="s445">But nevertheless, the Germans invented certain type of weapon.</span> <span id="s446">I don't know if it was not the V-2 rocket.</span> <span id="s447">When they shot an airplane, there was no escape.</span> <span id="s448">It was something...it may have a sensor kind of a..</span> <span id="s449">.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: Don't worry about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s452">So that the...this drove the rocket to the plane, it would tear it to pieces.</span> <span id="s453">So one...I was working and putting, as I said, gunpower.</span> <span id="s454">Fill the capsule with gunpowder, and ...and it was done by a machine.</span> <span id="s455">Now, I was guiding them.</span> <span id="s456">One day a prisoner who spoke Hungarian and Yiddish like myself; but he was a Frenchman.</span> <span id="s457">I didn't know then.</span> <span id="s458">Perfect Hungarian.</span> <span id="s459">And he says, "Uh, tell me.</span> <span id="s460">What would you do?</span> <span id="s461">Would you give up your life just to get rid of this maniac, Hitler?</span> <span id="s462">To defeat him, to get the war over...war over quicker?"</span> <span id="s463">I said, "Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Anything!</span> <span id="s465">Why?"</span> <span id="s466">He says, "Now, I want you to do this.</span> <span id="s467">See those?"</span> <span id="s468">They were electricians.</span> <span id="s469">They were French men.</span> <span id="s470">Civilians.</span> <span id="s471">They were working in that factory, munition factory.</span> <span id="s472">He says, "We're going to supply you with plain, ordinary sand.</span> <span id="s473">Now what I want you to do: you mix sand with the gunpowder before you put it in.</span> <span id="s474">Just put it in and mix it.”</span> <span id="s475">Oh, it was nothing to it.</span> <span id="s476">They brought me some food.</span> <span id="s477">And there was...and there was a bottom to that.</span> <span id="s478">And I ate farina.</span> <span id="s479">I'll never forget it, because it was my favorite.</span> <span id="s480">Oh, sure!</span> <span id="s481">And I was doing it.</span> <span id="s482">One day, it's another group came.</span> <span id="s483">And one of the...among the newcomer prisoners, there was a Nazi.</span> <span id="s484">A spy, who detected the whole sabotage movement and identified the 4 Mr. Braun does not remember the name of this camp.</span> <span id="s485">However, he believes it was near Luxembourg.</span> <span id="s486">He remembers seeing a sign which said "Villerupt."</span> <span id="s487">(Information from telephone conversation with Shony Alex Braun, 25 Jul 1991).</span> <span id="s488">Based on this information, it would appear that he was sent to Longwy-Thil, a subcamp of Natzweiler located in the northern Meurthe-et-Moselle section of Lorraine, right on the Luxembourg border (and close to the town of Villerupt).</span> <span id="s489">According to Arolsen, Longwy-Thil was opened on June 19, 1944 and closed in early September 1944--at which time, all of the prisoners were evacuated either to Kochendorf (in a transport sent September 1, 1944) or to Buchenwald/Dernau (in a transport sent September 4, 1944).</span></p> <p><span id="s490">leader.</span> <span id="s491">And he happened to be a French captain from the underground, smuggled among us.</span> <span id="s492">He was hanged.</span> <span id="s493">Everyone of us who worked...now I, now everybody were a saboteur.</span> <span id="s494">We were about 60 in that factory, prisoners that working.</span> <span id="s495">Everyone did something different.</span> <span id="s496">But I was the one who was putting sand, mixed with the thing, so that the second stage would not go off.</span> <span id="s497">And we were...were not allowed to avert our eyes from this man.</span> <span id="s498">We had to wait 'til he died, and watch him.</span> <span id="s499">Then 60 of us were lined up in a horizontal way, straight; and that SS guard came and looked.</span> <span id="s500">And went...he says, "You!</span> <span id="s501">Step out of the line.”</span> <span id="s502">And went, "You.”</span> <span id="s503">Do you know that half of them were selected at random?</span> <span id="s504">Now he passed me twice, and he stilled needed one.</span> <span id="s505">God honest truth!</span> <span id="s506">He still needed one prisoner.</span> <span id="s507">He wanted still one.</span> <span id="s508">He passed me again.</span> <span id="s509">I..</span> <span id="s510">.</span> <span id="s511">I was passed by three times for the very same day selecting 30.</span> <span id="s512">Half of them were right away shot, right at random.</span> <span id="s513">The others--meaning me--were sent back to the barrack, beaten severely; and I had a sign in my back this way, like a rainbow, said, "Saboteur.”</span> <span id="s514">So that any time, as I would be walking by, one of the kapo or one of the SS, they just kicked me.</span> <span id="s515">And what does God do?</span> <span id="s516">Not long after they...we had to give up.</span> <span id="s517">So we gave up our...our uniform.</span> <span id="s518">FInally, we...somehow, we got washed or...or--believe it or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">This is incredible, 'cause nothing was washed there.</span> <span id="s520">We were eaten up by lice and everything else.</span> <span id="s521">But this happened to be.</span> <span id="s522">And what does God do?</span> <span id="s523">I did not get the "Saboteur" back; so I was just a plain, ordinary prisoner.</span> <span id="s524">That was another miracle that I was not picked; because the idea was really, "Let me now suffer for a while.”</span> <span id="s525">And for...for many of us that they were selected, 30 of them--believe it or not, whoever listens to this--it's...it's incredible.</span> <span id="s526">For 29 of them, were given back the "Saboteur" thing.</span> <span id="s527">I was not having any.</span> <span id="s528">I was just having a plain, ordinary uniform.</span> <span id="s529">How it happened, I don't know.</span> <span id="s530">This is another miracle.</span> <span id="s531">Not speaking of the miracle really, I call.</span> <span id="s532">If you call...if somebody calls it "coincident," okay.</span> <span id="s533">But I do believe in miracles.</span> <span id="s534">So.</span> <span id="s535">Now not long after that, we were...the Allies were near.</span> <span id="s536">So the Germans--or the SS, I should say really-- liquidated us.</span> <span id="s537">They transferred us back...back to Germany.</span> <span id="s538">And while during the way we're going, you know, the Allies... the planes could be seen near.</span> <span id="s539">And occasionally these SS guards would be stopping and shooting at them, and they shot back.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">So many times, unfortunately, we prisoners got also the bullets flying from the airplanes.</span> <span id="s541">I have to mention something which happened--uh, talking about France and I saboteur...sabotaged.</span> <span id="s542">Happened in Cleveland, Ohio, in the early part of 50s.</span> <span id="s543">Uh, I came from school.</span> <span id="s544">I was going to Western Reserve University.</span> <span id="s545">And somebody gave me a check; because I had...I had no money, and I bought a car and I had to pay out certain things.</span> <span id="s546">So a friend...uh, gave me a check.</span> <span id="s547">And I thought, well, a check would be cashed at any bank.</span> <span id="s548">So I just walked in, and it had difficulty.</span> <span id="s549">I had language difficulty; and certainly I had no money in any car, in any...no account of a bank, not theirs or any other.</span> <span id="s550">So it was about noontime.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">And the teller was kind enough to escort me into bank...bank president's office, so that he spoke several languages.</span> <span id="s552">And maybe one of the languages that he spoke would be matching which...which I speak, you know, which I spoke.</span> <span id="s553">So at any rate...uh, now I speak five.</span> <span id="s554">At the time, it was four.</span> <span id="s555">This English was not the first.</span> <span id="s556">At any rate, I went to the bank director, and he was very courteous.</span> <span id="s557">And he says, "Well," he says, "are you French?"</span> <span id="s558">And I said, "No.”</span> <span id="s559">Because I ask him...I said, "Can we speak...Do you speak German?</span> <span id="s560">Do you speak French?"</span> <span id="s561">And he says, "German.”</span> <span id="s562">He says, "Well, are you French?"</span> <span id="s563">And I said, "No, but I was in France.”</span> <span id="s564">And I was relating the story what I actually did.</span> <span id="s565">And when I got to the point that I put sand instead of gun powder, he sprang from his...his chair where he was seated at the desk and ran to me and grabbed my hand and says, "God bless you!</span> <span id="s566">God Bless you!"</span> <span id="s567">I said, "Well, thank you.”</span> <span id="s568">He says, "Now, well, let me explain.</span> <span id="s569">My son and his...and mine crew, they were fighter pilots.”</span> <span id="s570">You know, they were bombing an area around France, around the place where the...where that munition factory was.</span> <span id="s571">And they were shot with one of these rockets which got caught...the rocket got caught in the wing or in the tail of the plane.</span> <span id="s572">They carried it back with them to the base.</span> <span id="s573">And, very carefully, they took this bomb...the rocket apart, see why it did not explode.</span> <span id="s574">They found sand in...in that capsule, which did not allow for the second stage impact.</span> <span id="s575">You know, the blowing up.</span> <span id="s576">Did not allow to blow up.</span> <span id="s577">Now, that was in about '51 or '52.</span> <span id="s578">Now, not long ago, in Houston, Texas, another fighter pilot was-- actually, I..</span> <span id="s579">.</span> <span id="s580">I found out about this fighter pilot was shot with one of this kind of a shell, and his did not explode.</span> <span id="s581">Now, I'm only praying to God, and I hope that there were many of these.</span> <span id="s582">Because if I would have been dead or they would have killed me, but knowing this now, I say, "It would have been worth it!"</span> <span id="s583">Just to save that many lives of.</span> <span id="s584">.</span> <span id="s585">of Allies, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Soldiers that they were trying to liberate the world from such a terrible thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: Let's go back.</span> <span id="s588">You are in France.</span> <span id="s589">Tell us what happened next.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: When...after the selection in France and being shot...executed because of the sabotage.</span> <span id="s591">And some miracle...miraculous way I was saved.</span> <span id="s592">Then not long after, as I mentioned, we were again transferred to another place--to Germany.</span> <span id="s593">And in Germany, I was assigned to work in a salt mine.</span> <span id="s594">My brother and my father, they were still alive.</span> <span id="s595">So all three of us managed still to be together.</span> <span id="s596">And we were working; and one...at Yom Kippur, in the salt mine.</span> <span id="s597">All of a sudden, the mine became dark; and we said, "This is a sign from heaven!"</span> <span id="s598">Because we were terribly tired.</span> <span id="s599">Now at this point we were less and less.</span> <span id="s600">We got less and less food, and we were...while our... Our condition was so deteriorated that some peopled started to get shingles.</span> <span id="s601">And they...they would be just working in this second, and the next second they would just keel over.</span> <span id="s602">And if you did that, they would not bother with you.</span> <span id="s603">I mean, there was no hospital.</span> <span id="s604">There was no room where you could rest.</span> <span id="s605">They would take you and be done with you; either to the gas chamber or they shot you to death.</span> <span id="s606">Or throw you into the ditch, and you die there.</span> <span id="s607">In the salt mine--as I said, Yom Kippur--immediately as the area became dark, we dropped everything and we sat down.</span> <span id="s608">Now, our...our work was, in the salt mine, to... They detonated big salt stones; and then we came with the... Would you believe that?</span> <span id="s609">A 14 year-old, at this point.</span> <span id="s610">We came and had those heavy hammers, and we were trying to break the salt stones--huge salt stones.</span> <span id="s611">Pieces as ...as large probably as...as...as this room, or larger.</span> <span id="s612">And they were actually...the Germans were building an underground street.</span> <span id="s613">A whole town underground.</span> <span id="s614">They were going to uh... uh...save the factories--(clearing throat) excuse me-- munition factories, because the Allies bombed them too much.</span> <span id="s615">So they...they wanted to save them; and we were the one who was going...who were going to build.</span> <span id="s616">And we did, in fact.</span> <span id="s617">There were so many fantastic places under the ground.</span> <span id="s618">I..</span> <span id="s619">.</span> <span id="s620">I couldn't possibly tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Maybe...maybe 200 feet under.</span> <span id="s622">And...but, as...as we were dropping on the ground ourselves ...uh...in 10 minutes later, light came back.</span> <span id="s623">Electricity was restored.</span> <span id="s624">What happened was actually one of prisoners who ask himself to be allowed to go to the latrina...you know, you call it.</span> <span id="s625">He couldn't stand it any longer.</span> <span id="s626">He had a..</span> <span id="s627">.</span> <span id="s628">a fork or a spoon fashioned into--you know, you were doing that--into a knife.</span> <span id="s629">And he cut the electric wire, and everything in that specific area became dark.</span> <span id="s630">Within seconds--I mean, not seconds.</span> <span id="s631">We were minutes.</span> <span id="s632">Uh, it took 10 minutes total to restore order, to restore the light.</span> <span id="s633">But the kapo noticed, and knew who was the one who went by that.</span> <span id="s634">He was caught.</span> <span id="s635">Then he was beaten severely.</span> <span id="s636">Again, we had to witness his hanging.</span> <span id="s637">And then again the same thing.</span> <span id="s638">People that they were there were picked at random.</span> <span id="s639">Again, I was bypassed.</span> <span id="s640">But we got a severe beating.</span> <span id="s641">And what happened actually, when we...when we dropped--I forgot to tell you--we were starting to chant the Kol Nidre.</span> <span id="s642">Somebody started; and there was about 40, 50 of us over there in that area.</span> <span id="s643">And the others got... Even...even if you didn't know the words, you know, you started started chanting it; because it was...it was Kol Nidre, it was Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s644">And when the light came back, the the SS came in and were severely beating us.</span> <span id="s645">"There's... there's no chanting!</span></p> <p><span id="s646">There's no...uh...holiday!</span> <span id="s647">There's arbeit!</span> <span id="s648">There's work!"</span> <span id="s649">And as I said, we then had to watch him hang.</span> <span id="s650">When...when we were...while we were still in salt mines, which was in Kochendorf.This is a small town.</span> <span id="s651">February...February 1945, my father turned 42.</span> <span id="s652">And at home we used to exchange gifts.</span> <span id="s653">We would be buying something for our parents, you know, even each other.</span> <span id="s654">No matter how small; but the idea we buying presents.</span> <span id="s655">And...but we had absolutely nothing to give.</span> <span id="s656">The SS stripped us of everything.</span> <span id="s657">Then I came up with the idea; and I went to my brother--whose name was Zoltan.</span> <span id="s658">And I said, "Why don't we give him our ration of bread for the day?"</span> <span id="s659">Now, our ration of bread was just a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s660">So Zoltan liked that, and he says, "Yes!"</span> <span id="s661">So in the evening, we approached our father and held out our hands with a piece of bread in it.</span> <span id="s662">And he would not hear about it.</span> <span id="s663">He says, "No!</span> <span id="s664">That is nourishment for you.</span> <span id="s665">That means life.</span> <span id="s666">I wouldn't think about it!"</span> <span id="s667">But we kept on insisting.</span> <span id="s668">So, and finally our...our insistence--with tears in his eyes, he said, "Thank God, that allowed me to live long enough to witness that graciousness, that love from my sons.”</span> <span id="s669">Next morning when would... [TAPE SPEED PROBLEM: END OF TAPE] 5 Subcamp of Natzweiler.</span> <span id="s670">Located near Württemberg.</span> <span id="s671">Opened September 3, 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">TAPE #3</span></p> <p><span id="s673">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: The next morning...</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: Next morning at 5:00 AM, as we always we did before going to the salt mine, we were counted.</span> <span id="s676">One prisoner was missing.</span> <span id="s677">After several recounts, prisoner...one prisoner was still missing.</span> <span id="s678">So the kapos went to the barrack to see...or to look for him.</span> <span id="s679">And they found the missing man sleeping in the corner.</span> <span id="s680">My father!</span> <span id="s681">They dragged him from...from his collar, from...from his collar to the SS guard.</span> <span id="s682">That's February: cold, snowing, ice on the ground.</span> <span id="s683">And the SS guard turned to the assembly, to us.</span> <span id="s684">And he said, "As I understand, the Jewish dog has here two sons.</span> <span id="s685">I want them to step out and come near him.</span> <span id="s686">Witness his punishment.”</span> <span id="s687">So we had to step out.</span> <span id="s688">So we step out, and we were standing near him.</span> <span id="s689">Then he turned to the rest of them.</span> <span id="s690">He says, "This dirty Jewish dog kept Germany from victory 10 minutes, because that's how long it took to find him!"</span> <span id="s691">Then he gave a swift kick to my father, which signaled the kapos to start the punishment.</span> <span id="s692">They rushed toward him, and was kicking and beating him from all direction.</span> <span id="s693">Whipping him.</span> <span id="s694">We fell on our knees.</span> <span id="s695">And we turned to the SS and said, "Please, stop!</span> <span id="s696">Beat us!</span> <span id="s697">Please don't do it!"</span> <span id="s698">The...the beating was even more severe.</span> <span id="s699">Then slowly, I started chanting the...the 22nd Psalm.</span> <span id="s700">I think it's the 22nd.</span> <span id="s701">"Eli, Eli, lama azavtanu?"</span> <span id="s702">--"Oh, God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken us?"</span> <span id="s703">They were beating him until he collapsed, my father.</span> <span id="s704">And was silent; except for his lips were moving, try to say something.</span> <span id="s705">And I noticed...came closer, and I noticed that he was reciting the declaration of faith of the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s706">Sh'ma.</span> <span id="s707">The Sh'ma: "Sh'ma Israel, Adonai elohenu, Adonai echad"--"Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is One.”</span> <span id="s708">And he was very silent.</span> <span id="s709">I must tell you that, first time in my life, the faith in God was destroyed.</span> <span id="s710">Completely broken.</span> <span id="s711">Like so many times, I heard after, people say: "How could God allow something like that happen to innocent people?"</span> <span id="s712">This is the same question I put then.</span> <span id="s713">How could God allow?</span> <span id="s714">I had no answer.</span> <span id="s715">Then, at night, in my dream, my father appear.</span> <span id="s716">And this is what he said.</span> <span id="s717">"Yitzhak.”</span> <span id="s718">He called me my Hebrew name.</span> <span id="s719">He says, "Don't ever lose your faith in God.</span> <span id="s720">God is real.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">You'll see.</span> <span id="s722">You'll survive.”</span> <span id="s723">Now, he spoke Hungarian in my dream; but what was so strange, he didn't say plural.</span> <span id="s724">He said, "you,"-- meaning "you and your brother"--but he said "you" the singular.</span> <span id="s725">And when we...when I woke up... Now, previous day when we seen that, Zoltan-- who was my brother--who was a very strong individual... He was one of those kind of a workout constantly, with muscles some...uh...incredible...uh...size.</span> <span id="s726">And he said...and he said to me, he says, "I am going to kill that SS!</span> <span id="s727">'Cause I don't want to live any longer.</span> <span id="s728">I cannot stand it any longer.</span> <span id="s729">I am going to commit suicide; but I am going to take that SS guard who gave the order for our father to be killed by being beaten to death!"</span> <span id="s730">And I said, "Zoltan, you wouldn't even come one step close, not even five inches close, to him before you would be shot.</span> <span id="s731">Don't do it!"</span> <span id="s732">No, he...he was determined to do it.</span> <span id="s733">And when the dream I told him, I said, "Father said, 'Don't lose all your faith in God.'"</span> <span id="s734">Which, of course, that restored my faith immediately.</span> <span id="s735">"But he said also we going to survive.”</span> <span id="s736">Then he completely abandoned the idea of killing; because he would have done that.</span> <span id="s737">I mean, you couldn't be...you wouldn't be able to kill that man, but he would be killed right away.</span> <span id="s738">And so one day the SS again gathered us together.</span> <span id="s739">Now, we're still in Kochendorf.</span> <span id="s740">They gathered us.</span> <span id="s741">Now, they're going to evacuate us for...another time.</span> <span id="s742">This time, destination Dachau.</span> <span id="s743">When in Dachau... Again they pulled the very same thing, like going from France to Kochendorf, back to Germany.Except this time, was much more severe.</span> <span id="s744">They stopped the train.</span> <span id="s745">And got out and started again, seeing the pilots coming so close... We could see actually the pilot.</span> <span id="s746">They started shooting.</span> <span id="s747">They took refuge or cover under the...under the uh train, you know.</span> <span id="s748">And these ...these pilots shot back.</span> <span id="s749">So, again, quite a few of the prisoners were shot.</span> <span id="s750">Now, in my... When we were in cattle cars, the bullets were flying left and right.</span> <span id="s751">And somebody... See, we were so sandwiched together that if you sit...if you sat down, you couldn't get up.</span> <span id="s752">If you were standing, you could not sit down.</span> <span id="s753">Because if you wanted to sit, the prisoners would be like dogs; fighting among each other, too.</span> <span id="s754">Completely we were brought down to the level of animals.</span> <span id="s755">And I happened to be seated at that point.</span> <span id="s756">The bullets were flying; and one of the prisoners who was very near me was shot and he fell.</span> <span id="s757">And he fell right on my head.</span> <span id="s758">And he died on my foot.</span> <span id="s759">And I couldn't...I tried to push him off.</span> <span id="s760">I couldn't push him off.</span> <span id="s761">There were no room to ...to make.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">And it was the most awful thing.</span> <span id="s763">It was another two or three days.</span> <span id="s764">Can you imagine?</span> <span id="s765">This man is on my foot.</span> <span id="s766">People, believe it!</span> <span id="s767">That's incredible!</span> <span id="s768">That's almost as impossible.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Impossible!</span> <span id="s770">It's somehow possible.</span> <span id="s771">It was on my foot then; and I couldn't... couldn't... My...my foot, both of them were numb--went to sleep, as you say.</span> <span id="s772">You know.</span> <span id="s773">Numb.</span> <span id="s774">And I tried desperately to move.</span> <span id="s775">Can you manage how like sandwich...over a sandwich, like sardines.</span> <span id="s776">You couldn't move...you couldn't move your...your leg one way or the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Incredible!</span> <span id="s778">Incredible!</span> <span id="s779">So, finally, we arrived to Dachau.</span> <span id="s780">After a day or so, I knew if something not going to happen soon, I'm not going to survive.</span> <span id="s781">At this point, I was so weak that I could hardly stand.</span> <span id="s782">And you have to stand, no matter what happen.</span> <span id="s783">When an SS guard came, in his presence you have to...you have to stand.</span> <span id="s784">One day, as we were standing in line, Zoltan--my brother--just fell.</span> <span id="s785">I said, "Oh, my God!</span> <span id="s786">Zoltan, get up!"</span> <span id="s787">I said, "What's wrong with you?"</span> <span id="s788">He said, "I don't feel good.</span> <span id="s789">I don't feel good.”</span> <span id="s790">And so he was taken away.</span> <span id="s791">I was told that he's gonna be taken into a place in the Revier [Ger: Hospital].</span> <span id="s792">They put him in to--I found out...what I'm gonna tell you right now, I found out only after liberation and only a month or two later, when...when I got to myself, even.</span> <span id="s793">Because I was a long time in coma.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">But we found out why.</span> <span id="s795">But he...he was taken away; and never seen him.</span> <span id="s796">And I was told that when an SS guard walked into that place, they would allow him maybe a few hours.</span> <span id="s797">And then, since he was strong enough--I mean, looked strong enough--to work, they would give him a few hours to recuperate.</span> <span id="s798">See what happens?</span> <span id="s799">When an SS walked in, everybody had to stand up.</span> <span id="s800">No matter how...how sick or what.</span> <span id="s801">Now, when he couldn't stand up, this SS stepped on his neck and choked him to death with his boots.</span> <span id="s802">Pressing his boots with his neck, and choked him to death.</span> <span id="s803">I only found after...after liberation, now as I mentioned.</span> <span id="s804">But as I..</span> <span id="s805">.</span> <span id="s806">as I said, in Dachau now, about a few days later I knew if something desperate...if something drastic not going to happen, I would not...I'm gonna wind up giving up.</span> <span id="s807">Because I..</span> <span id="s808">.</span> <span id="s809">I couldn't...I couldn't stand on my feet.</span> <span id="s810">What happens?</span> <span id="s811">One day an SS walks in, late night, wakes up the whole thing.</span> <span id="s812">You know?</span> <span id="s813">We were on just a piece of...of wood we were ...uh...uh...sleeping on.</span> <span id="s814">And he says, "Who can play the violin...” He's holding a violin and bow in his hand.</span> <span id="s815">"Who can play the violin, come in the front room.”</span> <span id="s816">This is where the Kapos 6 According to Arolsen, this evacuation took place on April 9, 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">were, and this is where the barrack doctor was.</span> <span id="s818">A Frenchman, by the way.</span> <span id="s819">And he says, "If you played..."--the guard--"that I'm going to like it, we gonna give you plenty of food and water.”</span> <span id="s820">Because that was terrible.</span> <span id="s821">We didn't have water.</span> <span id="s822">I and two others were volunteering.</span> <span id="s823">So we walked at the front...front room of the barrack, smaller room.</span> <span id="s824">And the violin was handed to the older man, who was in his 40s.</span> <span id="s825">He tuned the violin.</span> <span id="s826">The first few notes were shaky, but then he started to play Bach "Chacon,"--one of the sonata from Bach.</span> <span id="s827">It's so gorgeous, I never heard anything like that.</span> <span id="s828">Never heard it!</span> <span id="s829">But the SS was pulling his nose, like [it] stinks.</span> <span id="s830">Now one of the kapos...there were two kapos plus the barrack doctor were allowed to have that comfortable room--if you want to call it, you know, that front room.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">And one of the Kapo took the violin away from his hand.</span> <span id="s832">The other Kapo picked up a thick iron pipe, went behind this violinist; and he hit him so severely from behind that he cracked his skull open.</span> <span id="s833">And the...the blood and brain were splashing all over...all over the floor.</span> <span id="s834">And "God, my God!</span> <span id="s835">," I said to myself, "They don't want...they don't want no playing!</span> <span id="s836">This is another kind of a entertainment for the sake of the SS!"</span> <span id="s837">Which so many times the Kapos did that, and they did themselves.</span> <span id="s838">And I was petrified.</span> <span id="s839">Now I wanted to sneak back in the barrack.</span> <span id="s840">And one of the kapo picked me up from the collar and dragged me back.</span> <span id="s841">And while that was going on, they gave the violin to the second one.</span> <span id="s842">Now, he was about...I would say, about a 25 year-old young man, who was so shaken that he...he put the violin on--and you could see he was trembling--and not...not a note.</span> <span id="s843">He.</span> <span id="s844">.</span> <span id="s845">he...he didn't play a note.</span> <span id="s846">It was nothing he could play.</span> <span id="s847">And the SS says to him, "How do you dare come out when you cannot play the violin?!"</span> <span id="s848">And they started kicking him.</span> <span id="s849">They kicked...kicked his ribs in, because I..</span> <span id="s850">.</span> <span id="s851">I noticed that he couldn't breath.</span> <span id="s852">He was like... So he died right there.</span> <span id="s853">They...they pulled him off.</span> <span id="s854">Now while that was going on, now the Kapo picked up the violin and puts it in my hand and says, "Spiel!"</span> <span id="s855">--"Play!"</span> <span id="s856">"You came out," he says in German, "to play the violin.</span> <span id="s857">Play!"</span> <span id="s858">I was standing--here, something happened that not up today I could explain.</span> <span id="s859">Not up today.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">Now, if all the things that happened up to me...that I escaped two or three executions, you know.</span> <span id="s861">And switching with the son of the Sonderkommando places.</span> <span id="s862">And then I was not burned, but I was able to go to France, and...and so on.</span> <span id="s863">That ...if you want to call that...if somebody want to call this coincidence; [but] what happened to me here, this I like to...somebody to explain to me.</span> <span id="s864">Any other way but a miracle.</span> <span id="s865">So the violin, as I was mentioning, was given to my hand.</span> <span id="s866">I'm standing there... Now, when I got out of the barrack, I figured when my turn comes to play, I'm gonna play which I feel comfortable.</span> <span id="s867">I'm gonna play either a Sonatina by DvoÍák, which I performed; in fact, later I performed in Radio Munich.</span> <span id="s868">But which... Or I'm gonna play...uh...a Kreisler composition.</span> <span id="s869">But when...when I saw what I saw, and the violin in my hand, my mind went completely blank.</span> <span id="s870">Nothing came to me.</span> <span id="s871">And I said to myself, "God, how is this Sonatina starts?</span> <span id="s872">How is... the Kreisler piece starts?</span> <span id="s873">My God, how...how does anything starts?!"</span> <span id="s874">I couldn't think of anything!</span> <span id="s875">And now I noticed, from the corner of my eyes, that the murderer kapo picked up the iron pipe again and was walking toward me.</span> <span id="s876">And I knew I'm gonna be killed.</span> <span id="s877">I knew it.</span> <span id="s878">So my right hand and my left hand all of a sudden started moving in perfect harmony.</span> <span id="s879">And the Strauss "Blue Danube" was heard coming out of my violin.</span> <span id="s880">Now, how I never thought of the "Blue Danube.”</span> <span id="s881">Never.</span> <span id="s882">I heard it.</span> <span id="s883">In fact, I..</span> <span id="s884">.</span> <span id="s885">I'm even hate to admit to you, I never even played it really.</span> <span id="s886">I heard it many times from the Gypsies, and [from] my brother--who was a fantastic accordionist in his high school group.</span> <span id="s887">But playing, I was not even allowed to play anything else but classical.</span> <span id="s888">And the kapo looked at...eagerly to...to the SS: "When shall I whack him?</span> <span id="s889">When shall I hit him?"</span> <span id="s890">Instead, the SS guard was humming the melody, and was beating the rhythm with his fingers--like 1, 2, 3...1, 2, 3.</span> <span id="s891">And he...he just smiled and, "Let him live.”</span> <span id="s892">Now that specific night there was that French doctor, the barrack doctor.</span> <span id="s893">He also went around another barracks, attending.</span> <span id="s894">I don't know why they needed a doctor when we couldn't get nothing.</span> <span id="s895">However, he was there.</span> <span id="s896">And I reminded him of his son, who was about the same age as I and who was not passed by Mengele; because Mengele thought that he was too young to live--meaning, his son.</span> <span id="s897">And from that time on, he made sure that I would have more to eat.</span> <span id="s898">He did not... he got permission from the SS to keep me in the barrack and do the chores; like washing the floors, or even helping, you know, sometimes going and picking up those little cans which were cucumber peels.</span> <span id="s899">This was our ration, you know?</span> <span id="s900">And some kind of a black looking...uh...dirty water, which they called it "coffee.”</span> <span id="s901">But nevertheless, that allowed me to stay inside rather than go out in this...in that watery weather.</span> <span id="s902">Which was very... How can I tell you?</span> <span id="s903">Muddy.</span> <span id="s904">You know, in that time of the month, specifically.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Which, as I mentioned, was in Dachau; and ...and...uh...it was April, early part, and this is where the raining kind of a thing comes.</span> <span id="s906">And that allowed me to come to myself.</span> <span id="s907">I got an extra cucumber maybe, you know.</span> <span id="s908">And the SS would...would be giving to these people the...even the bread.</span> <span id="s909">For instance, the Kapos would help themselves before they would divide it.</span> <span id="s910">Now, this SS... We have time?</span> <span id="s911">This SS would then take me to the SS barracks, and I would be playing.</span> <span id="s912">From that time on, I could play anything.</span> <span id="s913">It was fine.</span> <span id="s914">But you know what they did?</span> <span id="s915">When I finished... By the way, that Kapo who was the murderer, he--at this point, when he saw that the SS loved what I was doing, the Strauss waltz... There was a guitar hanging on the wall, which was his; and he took the guitar off the wall and started accompanying me.</span> <span id="s916">Now the SS had...had an idea.</span> <span id="s917">He took him and I--this murderer Kapo and myself--go over to the SS barracks and play for his comrades.</span> <span id="s918">So we did that.</span> <span id="s919">When... when they said, "Hast du genug gespielt?"</span> <span id="s920">--Said, "Enough?</span> <span id="s921">Did you play enough?"</span> <span id="s922">"Well, if you don't want me to play more, then yes.”</span> <span id="s923">Then he says, "Go stand to the wall.”</span> <span id="s924">There was a brick wall.</span> <span id="s925">And what they were doing, they were shooting... They were drinking beer, and they were shooting at...at me; a head above me, side of me.</span> <span id="s926">You can imagine!</span> <span id="s927">I was like...</span></p> <p><span id="s928">How can I tell you?</span> <span id="s929">If they... Wishing: "Please end it.</span> <span id="s930">Please, end it.”</span> <span id="s931">And no matter how low, how animalistic, but you have that...still want to live.</span> <span id="s932">I mean, if you do death, this then end it once.</span> <span id="s933">They would never accept that some of the chips which came off the wall would graze me, would cut me here and there.</span> <span id="s934">But never hit me.</span> <span id="s935">Not one time.</span> <span id="s936">The Kapo!</span> <span id="s937">That murderer Kapo, he was asked...he says, "Now your turn.”</span> <span id="s938">By the way, the shooting happened many times after that.</span> <span id="s939">Day in, day out.</span> <span id="s940">Always ended up with giving me a nice slice of salami and...and also a bread, and a bucket full of water.</span> <span id="s941">But believe it or not, I..</span> <span id="s942">.</span> <span id="s943">I was so uh overtaken by that that I couldn't eat anything.</span> <span id="s944">And besides that, when I went back to the barrack, the rest of the...uh...prisoners... They allowed me to go take it into the barrack.</span> <span id="s945">The rest of the prisoners were like...like hungry dogs.</span> <span id="s946">Attack me.</span> <span id="s947">And they would tear the bread out of my hand.</span> <span id="s948">So one day, he was told by one, he says, one SS was--in fact, the one who found the violin--he was celebrating his birthday, and again got both of us out late.</span> <span id="s949">He wants to...he wants to celebrate.</span> <span id="s950">So we should go and play.</span> <span id="s951">We went to play.</span> <span id="s952">This SS--who, as I said, witnessed the beating and he was giving the okay--but his birthday it was.</span> <span id="s953">So when I was told to stand in...on the wall, because they going to play now with shooting, he said, "No.”</span> <span id="s954">Now the kapo--the head prisoner--he want him to stand there.</span> <span id="s955">So he...he says he is going to do the shooting alone because that's his birthday.</span> <span id="s956">So he had his beer, he sipped it, he drank, and he aimed.</span> <span id="s957">That's what they did before with me, too.</span> <span id="s958">He aimed to my head; and the last second they would shoot and...go up.</span> <span id="s959">So they saw me seeing that they're... right...going to be shooting me right in here (points to forehead).</span> <span id="s960">But in the last second--I don't how they did it--but the last second, as he did the bullet went over.</span> <span id="s961">He again... Now this time, as I mentioned, this Kapo--the murderer with the iron pipe, who is now the guitarist--he aimed it at his head, and he pulled the trigger without moving it and he hit him right in his...in his eyes.</span> <span id="s962">Between his eyes.</span> <span id="s963">The Kapo fell like a sack.</span> <span id="s964">Was dead instantly.</span> <span id="s965">All he says to...the SS says, "Oh, I missed!"</span> <span id="s966">Then he...he clicked ...clicked his...his heels, and he says, "Prosit!"</span> <span id="s967">-- means, "To your health!"</span> <span id="s968">--toward the Kapo.</span> <span id="s969">Now then the other SS, they started to...to... uh...argue among them who is going to do the shooting for me.</span> <span id="s970">Other words, now it's my turn to stand there.</span> <span id="s971">And while they could not agree and they started to be violent, another SS told me to get the H-E-L-L out of here.</span> <span id="s972">Because he was afraid they're gonna shoot up each other.</span> <span id="s973">But there again, I am sure if I..</span> <span id="s974">.</span> <span id="s975">if I would have been standing there back over there, he would have done the same thing to me.</span> <span id="s976">He would have done the same.</span> <span id="s977">But what happens: now, here I just escaped death again.</span> <span id="s978">But... To go on?</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Q: Actually, let's hold it a minute.</span> <span id="s980">This is a good time to break.</span> <span id="s981">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION</span></p> <p><span id="s982">TAPE #4</span></p> <p><span id="s983">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s985">We're back on camera.</span> <span id="s986">You have now gone back to the barrack.</span> <span id="s987">Tell us what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">A: So as I mentioned, that these...they were afraid and they're going to be a riot, and they're going to shoot each other.</span> <span id="s989">Because they were arguing, these SS, who should do the shooting when I be put against the wall.</span> <span id="s990">I was...my turn was to... Before it was only me who was standing there, but this time also, as I mentioned, that Kapo.</span> <span id="s991">Yah?</span> <span id="s992">And he was shot to death.</span> <span id="s993">So I was escorted by another SS back to the barrack.</span> <span id="s994">Not long after that happened, one day the SS came and he said, "Jews, Germans,"--because there were German prisoners--"Poles.</span> <span id="s995">Get out of the barrack.”</span> <span id="s996">And we were told that the...the Allies were very near.</span> <span id="s997">We could really daily see some of them flying over.</span> <span id="s998">It was in Dachau, now.</span> <span id="s999">Over Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">And...uh...we could really see the pilots.</span> <span id="s1001">And we were so overwhelmed, I cannot tell you.</span> <span id="s1002">And he said they're going to evacuate the camp, Dachau; and they're going to take it probably to Tyrol.</span> <span id="s1003">But they wanted us to get out; and we would be marched, and some people would be put on top of the truck into the forest.</span> <span id="s1004">And in a cleared forest, cleared place, you know; where we could stay...be there examined by the barrack doctor.</span> <span id="s1005">That mean the doctor himself--that French doctor, you know--he would be coming.</span> <span id="s1006">And so we were up...I was put in a truck and driven into that spot.</span> <span id="s1007">Now, some people started already as we went, says, "They not...they're not going to evacuate us.</span> <span id="s1008">They're taking us out of the camp, and they're going to kill us!"</span> <span id="s1009">They started to panic.</span> <span id="s1010">And many of us said, "No, no, no.</span> <span id="s1011">They wouldn't do that.</span> <span id="s1012">They could have done it there.”</span> <span id="s1013">Some people said, "No, they couldn't done it there.”</span> <span id="s1014">Because there was...I don't know, there was a thousand, 80,000, God knows how many thousand of...of prisoners were in Dachau.</span> <span id="s1015">And (clearing throat) so there would be a riot.</span> <span id="s1016">If I know that they're going to kill me, I'm going to spring against them.</span> <span id="s1017">What else can I lose?</span> <span id="s1018">I'm dead, but at least person that we hated... We certainly didn't like the SS, and...uh... what they were doing to us.</span> <span id="s1019">So they said, "Doctor came, and he's going to determine.”</span> <span id="s1020">However, there were machine guns hidden from our view, ready to fire.</span> <span id="s1021">And here again, they ordered prisoners to stay in line.</span> <span id="s1022">And this time was not like five, and then five behind.</span> <span id="s1023">But again like the horizontal way, you know.</span> <span id="s1024">So that next and then next...side by side, rather than the way I explained to you.</span> <span id="s1025">And this doctor, he knew.</span> <span id="s1026">He knew.</span> <span id="s1027">And he says, "Shh.</span> <span id="s1028">Alex!"</span> <span id="s1029">He called me Alex. "Alex, [Alles hundert, march!</span> <span id="s1030">(ph)].</span> <span id="s1031">Please, run!"</span> <span id="s1032">And I understood immediately what he's trying to tell me.</span> <span id="s1033">And I ran right into the forest.</span> <span id="s1034">I was chanting also the Sh'ma while I was running.</span> <span id="s1035">"Sh'ma Israel, Adonai elohenu, Adonai echad."</span> <span id="s1036">--"Hear, O Israel, the Lord is God, the Lord is One.”</span> <span id="s1037">And I felt terrible, hot something enter my chest.</span> <span id="s1038">I didn't even...I didn't hear any...any shots.</span> <span id="s1039">I..</span> <span id="s1040">.</span> <span id="s1041">I felt something entering my chest, that I had difficulty breathing.</span> <span id="s1042">And I just fell.</span> <span id="s1043">Now, the doctor, who was nearby--because he was also helping to form the line.</span> <span id="s1044">He was told to help form these.</span> <span id="s1045">Put these prisoners in barracks and barracks and barracks, you know.</span> <span id="s1046">One barrack at a time, and then another barrack would be... At any rate, he saw me fall; and he ran toward me and picked up...he...he... I was trying to get up; but he gently pushed me.</span> <span id="s1047">And so was an SS guard with drawn out revolver.</span> <span id="s1048">And he was very angry.</span> <span id="s1049">How did I dare run?</span> <span id="s1050">That means I'm tried to escape.</span> <span id="s1051">That's already punishable by death to begin with.</span> <span id="s1052">Now, it's his job to kill everybody there.</span> <span id="s1053">So he came; but the doctor was first.</span> <span id="s1054">As I tried to get up, he gently pushed me and took my pulse.</span> <span id="s1055">And he turned...he was already knee...half, you know, kneeled on the...on the ground.</span> <span id="s1056">And looked up to the SS who was aiming to my head.</span> <span id="s1057">He says, "No shoot.</span> <span id="s1058">Drei minute, kaput!"</span> <span id="s1059">--meaning, "In three minutes, he'll be dead.”</span> <span id="s1060">The SS saying to him... Now he was putting his revolver away; and he says, "Let's this dog suffer the three minutes!</span> <span id="s1061">He's not worth the cost of another bullet.”</span> <span id="s1062">Because the officer, they had to pay...they have to pay for the bullets, the ammunition.</span> <span id="s1063">They have to buy, apparently--so this is what my understanding was there.</span> <span id="s1064">So I wasn't worth it.</span> <span id="s1065">Now he went back, and...and signaled for the rest of it, for the rest of the people to be killed.</span> <span id="s1066">When this killing was over, and they were... The French prisoners, presently, they were excepted.</span> <span id="s1067">Now, later on they would be killed anyway; but presently, they were excepted.</span> <span id="s1068">They came along, and they were the one who picked up the bodies and throw them on the truck.</span> <span id="s1069">Now the same truck who brought me from the camp, now it would be taking me back either to be thrown in the ditch or burned...cremated.</span> <span id="s1070">So the French doctor told them that when they take me back to the camp, take me into the French barrack.</span> <span id="s1071">There was a French barrack where only French people were.</span> <span id="s1072">He changed the insignia of a Jew to the Frenchman.</span> <span id="s1073">Now, I was going to show; but I'm not going to now.</span> <span id="s1074">But, however, in my violin case I always carry--I will tell you why I carry--a tweezer and a knife, a pocket knife.</span> <span id="s1075">But he fished out the bullet.</span> <span id="s1076">The doctor came into the French barrack.</span> <span id="s1077">He fished out the bullet with a tweezers and pocket knife, without giving me any anesthetic.</span> <span id="s1078">And next day, the day after, wonderful Americans liberated Dachau.This is how I am here to tell you about my story.</span> <span id="s1079">Because if it would not be for that... You see, even a day longer... By the way-- which is very little known to people--but no matter what would have happened, Dachau would have been blown up.</span> <span id="s1080">Because it was mined.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">Q: Let's...let's stay with your story.</span> <span id="s1082">OK?</span> <span id="s1083">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">Q: Tell us what happened when you became conscious.</span> <span id="s1085">When did you become conscious?</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1087">First... After, of course, I got conscious, I found out that the doctors... I was taken by the Americans into a nearby hospital in Gauting, near Munich.</span> <span id="s1088">And the doctors said no way that I can survive.</span> <span id="s1089">No way!</span> <span id="s1090">I..</span> <span id="s1091">.</span> <span id="s1092">I would be dying, and I'll be dead.</span> <span id="s1093">Because first that bullet which was removed without...without anything, you know, was already infection set...set in.</span> <span id="s1094">Which already I had blood poisoning from that.</span> <span id="s1095">Maybe there is another term to that, but this is what... I also had already--which was not known to me--I had tuberculosis.</span> <span id="s1096">And I also had...uh... What you call it?</span> <span id="s1097">Stomach...uh... Well, I..</span> <span id="s1098">.</span> <span id="s1099">I..</span> <span id="s1100">.</span> <span id="s1101">it escapes me.</span> <span id="s1102">Not diphtheria.</span> <span id="s1103">But there are other words... Plus, was all...all the...I had run down.</span> <span id="s1104">I was run down.</span> <span id="s1105">So there's no way that I..</span> <span id="s1106">.</span> <span id="s1107">I would survive.</span> <span id="s1108">In fact, where occasionally I would come to myself... And that's where I'm going to mention Sári; because it happened...it happened that I was put in the very same hospital that she also was brought in.</span> <span id="s1109">But she was brought in with tuberculosis, 7 Dachau was liberated on April 29, 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">and...and, of course, run down from uh malnutrition and hard labor.</span> <span id="s1111">And she also had been beaten...beaten.</span> <span id="s1112">Everything beatings, you know.</span> <span id="s1113">Was beaten several times.</span> <span id="s1114">But she was telling the story she heard it even before, that there was a young boy--namely me--who is dying, and my only wish was for the doctors to bring me a violin.</span> <span id="s1115">Occasionally, I would come to myself.</span> <span id="s1116">First, I was absolutely in a coma for a long time.</span> <span id="s1117">And when I would come ...occasionally, I'd say, "Where is my violin?"</span> <span id="s1118">So one day...so one day, strange as it sounds, when I came to my...myself, there I seen a violin.</span> <span id="s1119">And the doctor says, "Here.</span> <span id="s1120">There's a violin!"</span> <span id="s1121">And I was overwhelmed.</span> <span id="s1122">Now, supposedly that was a great help.</span> <span id="s1123">But I am sure God was the one who really helped me.</span> <span id="s1124">At any rate, I would be sometimes sitting up, you know, with pillows and so on, so forth.</span> <span id="s1125">And I would be playing; and the windows would be open.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">And it could be heard outdoors in the hospital.</span> <span id="s1127">And the patients--they were all Holocaust survivors--that they could walk, they would come and listen.</span> <span id="s1128">And I would be playing.</span> <span id="s1129">And that's what happened, that Sári asked somebody, "Who's playing?"</span> <span id="s1130">She...she thought it was beautiful, but I can't imagine.</span> <span id="s1131">"Who's playing?"</span> <span id="s1132">"That...that's the boy who's dying, and that was his wish.”</span> <span id="s1133">Sári would one day--that I did not know, because I was not in myself, you know, with the relapsing back to coma.</span> <span id="s1134">Or comatose, or whichever it is more correct to say.</span> <span id="s1135">She would come in, and she was only 12 years old.</span> <span id="s1136">And she would come and sit next to my bed, and would be crying.</span> <span id="s1137">But she knew that I was dying, so at least I had nobody.</span> <span id="s1138">You know?</span> <span id="s1139">And she had a sister and a brother.</span> <span id="s1140">Thank God, they still have it.</span> <span id="s1141">They would occasionally come to visit her; but the boy who is dying and playing the violin--to her liking, at least--uh, has nobody.</span> <span id="s1142">And she would be there and asking God to help me.</span> <span id="s1143">That's...that's really something!</span> <span id="s1144">But God wanted differently.</span> <span id="s1145">But as soon as I recup...I was better, I still lived in a hospital.</span> <span id="s1146">But I would enroll in school.</span> <span id="s1147">First in Munich; and from there would be uh having a scholarship by the Ford company--or the Rockefeller Foundation, forgive me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">Would uh...I..</span> <span id="s1149">.</span> <span id="s1150">I won that scholarship among...I don't know how many, three hundred auditioners.</span> <span id="s1151">Uh, so then I would be going to Salzburg; and this is where I'm graduated, and have a masters degree from that school in music.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">Q: How long did you stay in Europe uh before you came to the United States?</span> <span id="s1153">A: (Clearing throat) Well, we...we stood [NB: stayed] there 1950.</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">Q: Let's back up a little bit.</span> <span id="s1155">You won the competition in Salzburg.</span> <span id="s1156">Sári, I gather, grew up.</span> <span id="s1157">Did you stay together?</span> <span id="s1158">What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1160">When...uh...first, of course, there...uh...the award which I got from the Rockefeller Foundation, the scholarship; and I went to Munich.</span> <span id="s1161">And first I enrolled, or at least I continued, to finish uh my high school; which...which I did.</span> <span id="s1162">And then I enrolled in pre-med.</span> <span id="s1163">And that's very interesting.</span> <span id="s1164">That same time, also, in the conservatory--in the same building.</span> <span id="s1165">I was in Munich.</span> <span id="s1166">The same building you could have...it was a conservatory, and you could go to pre-med.</span> <span id="s1167">And one day I got...and I was living in the hospital.</span> <span id="s1168">A doctor, who would be about the age of my father if he would have lived, was my roommate.</span> <span id="s1169">They brought in a..</span> <span id="s1170">.</span> <span id="s1171">a roommate.</span> <span id="s1172">And so, he's a doctor.</span> <span id="s1173">To myself I said, "How wonderful!</span> <span id="s1174">He's going to help me with my studies.”</span> <span id="s1175">Yes, but I was meanwhile practicing.</span> <span id="s1176">And he said, "Why on earth would you want to be a doctor when you accomplish...you look...you sound like an accomplished violinist?"</span> <span id="s1177">And turned out that he was actually an amateur conductor.</span> <span id="s1178">He was a very fine conductor, by the way, but amateur if you don't make money.</span> <span id="s1179">In...in Transylvania.</span> <span id="s1180">He was a Transylvanian.</span> <span id="s1181">That was what's so wonderful about it.</span> <span id="s1182">He spoke the language which I spoke.</span> <span id="s1183">And this is why I was so overwhelmed that he's going to help me--my studies, medical studies.</span> <span id="s1184">But no, he took me off of it.</span> <span id="s1185">And he says, "No,"; he says, "It's gonna take you a long time until you finish.</span> <span id="s1186">Then you go in a different country, they're going to make you take it all over again.”</span> <span id="s1187">He says, "When you going to go into a different country, even if you don't finish school, all they're going to tell you, 'Pick up your violin and play.'</span> <span id="s1188">They're not going to ask you, 'Now which school did you finish?</span> <span id="s1189">Which school you have your diploma?'</span> <span id="s1190">They're gonna...they gonna want to hear you.”</span> <span id="s1191">Which was right, in a way.</span> <span id="s1192">And sure enough, but I had a chance to finish.</span> <span id="s1193">Anyway, and meanwhile I went.</span> <span id="s1194">.</span> <span id="s1195">one time I went into...when I was better--I'm talking what happened in that four or five years which we stood [NB: stayed] in Germany, which I was studying.</span> <span id="s1196">So immediately as I got strong enough, still in the hospital, I went to where the women were.</span> <span id="s1197">And I was looking to see maybe my sister, my older sister, would be among them.</span> <span id="s1198">Because I knew then that my mother and my little sister, what happened.</span> <span id="s1199">But I didn't know what happened to the other.</span> <span id="s1200">And I met Shári, but I was just only seeing her for a second.</span> <span id="s1201">But when...when we sort of grew up, we just talking.</span> <span id="s1202">And one day that talk became a little more friendlier.</span> <span id="s1203">And in all honesty --and I'm gonna say that for the world, you know, to the world--that it was not the way as people accustomed today.</span> <span id="s1204">I have no judgement, whichever...whoever does what.</span> <span id="s1205">This is their business.</span> <span id="s1206">But however, that--call it "old fashion"--way was not that you "went together" maybe--I don't know how strongly I can say--before you get married.</span> <span id="s1207">You know what I mean.</span> <span id="s1208">And so, at any rate, she was...before she became...just before she became 17, we got married.</span> <span id="s1209">And soon after, we came to the United States.</span> <span id="s1210">But at that time, I was studying and so was she.</span> <span id="s1211">And...uh...I had a chance to finish uh the Academy of Music in Salzburg; which I am very, very lucky to tell you.</span> <span id="s1212">And then coming to the United States started some other problems.</span> <span id="s1213">And it was very, very difficult.</span> <span id="s1214">At first, you could not get a..</span> <span id="s1215">.</span> <span id="s1216">I could not land a job.</span> <span id="s1217">In fact, I was offered a job in a school; because I have the credentials to teach.</span> <span id="s1218">However, by the time I got here to the United States, it took so long... I was not well yet.</span> <span id="s1219">And uh was difficulty because even though that I recovered from tuberculosis, but America at that time they were very reluctant to let, even though that I was "cured.”</span> <span id="s1220">Which I am, thank God.</span> <span id="s1221">But still I had to go through tests, and another test, and wait, and ; and this kind of a thing.</span> <span id="s1222">So that job was gone.</span> <span id="s1223">And I did certain things that...when I was going to school.</span> <span id="s1224">I became a filing clerk in an office.</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">Then, still in part-time, I became the uh manager of the...uh... Oh, it's sort of a..</span> <span id="s1226">.</span> <span id="s1227">How do you call that?</span> <span id="s1228">Uh, a factory, which they manufactured dresses.</span> <span id="s1229">I had absolutely no idea about that; but I was working in the very same...same uh office for the same people.</span> <span id="s1230">And I was doing so well that when... Well, from one day to the other the owner of that factory, [his] brother-in-law left him.</span> <span id="s1231">They thought that I would be doing well.</span> <span id="s1232">And, my God, would you believe I did?</span> <span id="s1233">Just on part-time!</span> <span id="s1234">(Laughing) So finally after I got a job in the Cleveland symphony--or a position, I should say.</span> <span id="s1235">Uh, then I had difficulty leaving that man; because...uh... I will tell you honestly.</span> <span id="s1236">It was [Lempol (ph)] Fashions.</span> <span id="s1237">It was a wonderful uh dress manufacture.</span> <span id="s1238">They're not in existence, so I can mention that.</span> <span id="s1239">I don't mean to...I don't mean to give any plug, you know.</span> <span id="s1240">But it isn't that.</span> <span id="s1241">They were nice people; and...uh...so he...he was offering me any kind of a thing...so even in part- time.</span> <span id="s1242">Because my only day... Of course, we married; and a boy came to us, first child, and the second one.</span> <span id="s1243">We have two children, by the way.</span> <span id="s1244">And...uh, may I mention, Robert.</span> <span id="s1245">Now he's a physician.</span> <span id="s1246">We're very proud of him.</span> <span id="s1247">And so are we very proud of our daughter, Dinah, who also... She finished school.</span> <span id="s1248">She has a degree in psychology.</span> <span id="s1249">However, she's a business lady now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">Q: You have been playing the violin.</span> <span id="s1251">Just tell us a little bit about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">A: In Europe um I was... After, of course, liberation and I was still in school.</span> <span id="s1253">But I was having offers; and I played with various symphony orchestras.</span> <span id="s1254">And also Radio Munich.</span> <span id="s1255">And in various cities, almost in every one of them.</span> <span id="s1256">Then I gave command performances, and I'm gonna mention a few.</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">Q: Not.</span> <span id="s1258">.</span> <span id="s1259">not...not the whole thing, no.</span> <span id="s1260">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">Q: No.</span> <span id="s1262">Because it's not that kind of a professional listing.</span> <span id="s1263">Just tell us, when you came to the United States...</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">Q: ...did you...?</span> <span id="s1266">Uh, you got a position with the Cleveland Symphony.</span> <span id="s1267">How long were with you them, and where did you go from there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">A: I was only with three years with the Symphony.</span> <span id="s1269">And uh a very strange thing--not even that long, probably.</span> <span id="s1270">Three...after three seasons, a very strange thing uh made me quit.</span> <span id="s1271">One is that...you remember I mentioned earlier that I was lost in a forest, and I was exposed to the violin by the Gypsies.</span> <span id="s1272">And I really loved Gypsy music from that time on.</span> <span id="s1273">Always!</span> <span id="s1274">And secretly, I would be going back to the forest and listening to the Gypsies.</span> <span id="s1275">I would sometimes disappear from home; but at the time I was already older, you know, than four years old, of course.</span> <span id="s1276">But 11 or 12.</span> <span id="s1277">And I would be asking these Gypsies to teach me some of the songs that they played that was so fantastic.</span> <span id="s1278">And they did.</span> <span id="s1279">So I learned a lot of different kind of music.</span> <span id="s1280">Even if I was not allowed to play.</span> <span id="s1281">But as I said, secretly I would be doing that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">And...uh...so...in Cleveland, as I said, certain strange circumstance got me... uh, made me to leave the symphony orchestra.</span> <span id="s1283">First, it was really very badly paid at those time.</span> <span id="s1284">And secondly, the conductor, uh Maestro [George] Szell, was very rough, so to speak.</span> <span id="s1285">I shouldn't say that uh openly, because there are millions of people may know him.</span> <span id="s1286">However, he was probably one of the greatest in the world.</span> <span id="s1287">And...uh...I also had a job--an offer, that is--uh, to play this kind of music and teach.</span> <span id="s1288">Teach, actually.</span> <span id="s1289">So I left, and I got lots of pupils.</span> <span id="s1290">But that was very straining on me.</span> <span id="s1291">So finally, I got a job in a restaurant; which was, of course, much more profitable.</span> <span id="s1292">And I met a lot of people and I learned lot about the way of people living in the United States.</span> <span id="s1293">Which I really loved to be here.</span> <span id="s1294">And uh this also made me grew up in a different way.</span> <span id="s1295">Because I was very, very sensitive when I came.</span> <span id="s1296">And probably I would be still sitting in an orchestra.</span> <span id="s1297">However, I'm not sorry at all.</span> <span id="s1298">Because mentioning once, since you are from Washington, uh if I would be in that orchestra--like Cleveland Symphony--being just a violinist in the orchestra... Even the first violin section, but still I would never be invited to the White House--as I was a few years ago, during the Reagan era, you know.</span> <span id="s1299">And that was a big thing.</span> <span id="s1300">Or...or go to Italy and give a concert; or to go to Jerusalem and give a concert.</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">It...it's...these kind of a thing would have not occurred, because I would be still maybe a screw in a big machine, a little teeny screw.</span> <span id="s1302">Uh, so I'm not sorry at all that I left that part.</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">Q: And you have made a new life here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">A: Oh, Yah.</span> <span id="s1305">Well, as I said, now I am... For instance, which I'm very proud to mention, I wrote several--I'm a composer also--several pieces.</span> <span id="s1306">And one of them which is my...probably the greatest thing that I ever written in my life entitled the "Symphony of the Holocaust.”</span> <span id="s1307">Which I was fortunate to perform it with two major symphony orchestras, large symphony orchestras.</span> <span id="s1308">And uh so I just keep on writing and playing as long as God wants me to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">Q: Good.</span> <span id="s1310">And on that note, I think now we will end this section.</span> <span id="s1311">Thank you.</span> <span id="s1312">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">TAPE #5: PERFORMANCE The violin he plays is a Galliano (circa 1740), from the workshop of Amati (teacher of Stradivarius).</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">"Blue Danube" (Johann Strauss)--He plays this piece as he played it in Dachau, up to the point where the SS officer stopped him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">"Symphony of the Holocaust" (Shony Alex Braun)--Excerpts "Song of the Holocaust"</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">"The Prayer"</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">"The Liberation" "Song of Commemoration" (there are several takes of this piece) "Song of Joy of Life and Freedom" "The Lark" (unclear on tape who wrote the version he plays here--whether this is his, or the work of a famous Romanian composer whom he mentions has inspired him)</span></p></body></html>
