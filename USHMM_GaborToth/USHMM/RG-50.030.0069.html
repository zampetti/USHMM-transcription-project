middle of our vacation we left, and we had to go back and we couldn't...uh...get a train.</span> <span id="s50">We had to walk for a long time.</span> <span id="s51">I remember walking to...uh...and riding in a..</span> <span id="s52">.</span> <span id="s53">on...on a cart for awhile and it was very difficult to come back to Chelm, but we finally made it and...uh...that's what I remember from before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: What happened?</span> <span id="s55">What are your recollections when the Germans came to Chelm at the outbreak of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: Well, first thing...uh...what happened is that we lived in a..</span> <span id="s57">.</span> <span id="s58">in a..</span> <span id="s59">.</span> <span id="s60">in Chelm on...uh...and my grandfather owned a very big building, one of the biggest there, and it was LaBelska 23 was the street number there.</span> <span id="s61">It...It was with a big courtyard in the middle and the building went around...uh...I think two blocks or more.</span> <span id="s62">At least...uh...the front was the main street.</span> <span id="s63">LaBelska was the main street and the back was where later on was the ghetto of the building.</span> <span id="s64">So we...I remember had to move to the back of the...uh...building where the ghetto was because they Jews was not allowed to live on LaBelska street.</span> <span id="s65">Even it was our building, we could not live there anymore.</span> <span id="s66">And I remember the first thing my father...uh...was trying...the rumor at that time was that they're going to kill or take away the men only, so my father with a group of men organized to run away to Russia and they...I remember sitting on the...in the window watching him going with my mother...uh...kissing him and he went up on a wagon with horses and they been gone...they gone away.</span> <span id="s67">That's the last picture I remember and the last time I ever saw my father.</span> <span id="s68">He went to...uh...Russia.</span> <span id="s69">I mean he didn't get there.</span> <span id="s70">On the way he heard that they're going...that they're killing Jews, also children and women, and he was trying to come back and get my...uh...my mother and me and the...he was killed when he stopped in...in...Lugof...I don't... in a place...uh...uh...where my uncle...one of my...one of my ...uh...mother's brother lived.</span> <span id="s71">And...uh...he was killed there, with my uncle at that time and my uncle's name was Shear Frucht.</span> <span id="s72">He was killed at the same time.</span> <span id="s73">That's what I heard from my mother.</span> <span id="s74">And...uh...we lived in...in that...uh... house in the back of house which is...was turned to a ghetto.</span> <span id="s75">And we lived in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s76">Uh...The only one I remember is my Aunt...uh...Etty and...uh...she lived with us, with her husband and three children.</span> <span id="s77">And...uh...my mother and I was there.</span> <span id="s78">Uh...Now Everybody by that time was killed and the...my...uh...during the war, there was, of course, no...not much money because my Aunt Etty...uh... husband worked for the...they made him work for the German and they didn't pay.</span> <span id="s79">They only took him away and he used to come...I don't know in the evening or sometimes back and...uh...so my mother was trying to...uh...sell things and one of the things she was selling was flour like a little...uh...she sold.</span> <span id="s80">She had I remember two...uh...big sacks...big...uh...buckets with flour was selling one of the items and maybe other things, but I don't remember and...uh...to survive.</span> <span id="s81">And the during...German one time...uh...came over to the house.</span> <span id="s82">Somebody must have told him.</span> <span id="s83">I don't know how they found out, and they took her away...uh...to the... There was in Chelm a Jewish...Jewish...uh...police, and they put her in a Jewish police...uh...in a jail kind of.</span> <span id="s84">They were supposed to send her away to a concentration camp at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">And...uh...we knew a policeman by the name of Chesick who knew our family.</span> <span id="s86">He knew my grandfather very well and my...uh...he was an older man, and he...he was a policeman.</span> <span id="s87">He was...uh...and he was helping her.</span> <span id="s88">Once in a while he came to visit my mother and so he came and he got my mother out because he was Polish policeman.</span> <span id="s89">He had more authorities over the Jewish policeman and he took him....he took her out from the jail at that time.</span> <span id="s90">Later on, she was working for the German and they made...they used to go in the morning and work in the fields.</span> <span id="s91">I am not...I remember they dig something.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">They made the...I don't know what they digged, but it was in the fields for awhile.</span> <span id="s93">And...uh...there was aktion where they...what they called aktion in Polish where the German decided every day or that they could kill all the Jews who can...they...they find in the house who don't work.</span> <span id="s94">So they been going around and killing from house to house and looking for the one they didn't have certain papers or they didn't work or they been...or children or sick people and they...uh...came to our house.</span> <span id="s95">At that time my mother was at work.</span> <span id="s96">And my aunt was watching the children.</span> <span id="s97">Uh...She was like a babysitter and she was...had papers that her husband is working and she is sick and...uh...the...there was about...quite a lot.</span> <span id="s98">.</span> <span id="s99">about few children...I must have been the biggest one and another boy was the biggest one.</span> <span id="s100">I was 6 years old at that time, maybe 5...a little bit before 6.</span> <span id="s101">And...uh... they came to our house and they found my aunt and they...all the little children there and me and that little boy and they...uh...this...uh...uh...they took my aunt and they shot her.</span> <span id="s102">And they killed her.</span> <span id="s103">She fell down the steps.</span> <span id="s104">We lived on the second floor and she kind of rolled down the stairs all the way on the back and they pushed her over to the...on the bottom.</span> <span id="s105">And...uh...they was going to shoot me and my...uh...and that little boy, I don't remember his name...but he was about my age.</span> <span id="s106">He was the neighbor's boy who lived in the neighborhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">And...uh...we... uh...started...there was about 10 Germans around there and the officer was standing downstairs...downstairs and watching us and he told us...they told us to come down, walk down the stairs and hurry up.</span> <span id="s108">Hurry up.</span> <span id="s109">They...uh...started screaming at us.</span> <span id="s110">And...uh...somehow that boy got very hysterical and he started laughing very loud and I don't know why.</span> <span id="s111">And I was crying very hard.</span> <span id="s112">And that must have been a funny picture for those Germans.</span> <span id="s113">They all started laughing because I was crying and he was laughing and we been going down those stairs with...and the...when we got downstairs the policeman...the officer there, a German officer...well, I heard him say...I understood at that time a little...few words in German already...and...uh...he said, "Well, we killed enough Jews for the day.</span> <span id="s114">Let them go.”</span> <span id="s115">So they shove...sent us upstairs and they left.</span> <span id="s116">And the...that's how we survived...I survived that day.</span> <span id="s117">That was one of the times.</span> <span id="s118">They came...after that there was a few other times that they...uh...they came and the...but I..</span> <span id="s119">.</span> <span id="s120">uh...learned to hide.</span> <span id="s121">Under the stairs there was a little...uh.</span> <span id="s122">.</span> <span id="s123">uh... place where they...it was called a lock...uh...a closet where I got into the closet and locked myself with some other people who were hiding there.</span> <span id="s124">And I was little at that time, and the...actually those people didn't want me even there.</span> <span id="s125">They wanted to get...because they been afraid I'll cry or make noises, but my mother said I shouldn't get out, so I didn't and I stayed there.</span> <span id="s126">And after awhile...while my mother was afraid to leave me there, so she sneaked me out from the...uh.</span> <span id="s127">.</span> <span id="s128">ghetto...uh...at night.</span> <span id="s129">Early in the morning, She paid...uh...Jewish policeman to get me out and he...he got me out and she...I was hiding with her in the...in the fields where she worked and between the...I remember it was very hot during the day.</span> <span id="s130">Then it get cold at night.</span> <span id="s131">Later on, I remember she worked in a factory.</span> <span id="s132">They must have transferred her.</span> <span id="s133">And they...they let us hide.</span> <span id="s134">I don't know how she arranged it.</span> <span id="s135">Only me.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">And...and there was a few other kids from other employers who worked there hiding in the attic of the factory up...uh...on the...and we used to look downstairs through the attic and see the officer...the Nazi walking down the stairs and looking, checking who is the...the workers and the Jews...looking for the Jews.</span> <span id="s137">And I was hiding upstairs.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Uh...There was never enough food so we just...most of the food I remember we ate is bread and water and I don't remember if we had anything else.</span> <span id="s139">Uh...My mother...uh...always was hiding.</span> <span id="s140">Then they...I remember...was trying to hide me.</span> <span id="s141">At that time only my...uh.</span> <span id="s142">.</span> <span id="s143">cousins been left.</span> <span id="s144">My cousin...my mother's...my mother's sister...the one who was killed had three children been left, and my mother was trying to take care on them also.</span> <span id="s145">Uh...Then...uh...I remember my...that Polish policeman came one evening and he said that they're going to close the ghetto.</span> <span id="s146">They're going to send all the Jews away and to the concentration camp and they're going to...uh...or kill them or they're closing the ghetto.</span> <span id="s147">And he wanted my mother to come to...he said she can come to his house and he will hide her.</span> <span id="s148">And...uh...my mother would not come by herself because ...uh...she said she wanted to take me and also the other...uh...my cousin...my cousins who were in there.</span> <span id="s149">And he would not agree.</span> <span id="s150">The only he agree finally is to take me.</span> <span id="s151">So she didn't have a choice.</span> <span id="s152">At night she sneaked me out.</span> <span id="s153">And...uh...I don't know what arrangements she made with the others.</span> <span id="s154">My cousins were older than I am.</span> <span id="s155">Two of them been twins and they must have been 15 or 16 at that time, and they had a little sister was about maybe a year younger or a few months younger than I am.</span> <span id="s156">So she made some kind of arrangements with somebody else to watch over them and they...uh...stayed and we sneaked out.</span> <span id="s157">She took, I remember, some blankets and clothes she had and we carried it to his house at night.</span> <span id="s158">And we sneaked into his house and just a few...maybe a week or so we stayed in the house, and I remember it one morning...uh...my cousins came over to the house and they knocked on the door and they wanted to come in...all those three girls and he wouldn't let them in.</span> <span id="s159">And we been sitting in back and crying but he wouldn't let them in because it was too dangerous for him also to keep any Jews.</span> <span id="s160">If they would've caught him, they would've killed him and all his family.</span> <span id="s161">The reason why he decided, I understand, to keep us is because...uh...he was sick and he had cancer and he knew he is going to die soon and he wanted to do something good before he died.</span> <span id="s162">He said he did so many bad things already and he...he was religious Catholic, Polish.</span> <span id="s163">And he knew my family and he must have liked my mother and he...uh...decided to save us though his family, his wife and his children didn't...was...was against it.</span> <span id="s164">They been afraid that they be caught and killed, but he made them so he didn't...uh...so he made his children...he sent to his brother in the...another...in a village next to there.</span> <span id="s165">And the only one stayed was his wife and his older daughter in the house.</span> <span id="s166">And the...after...uh...awhile we...he was hiding us first in a potato...uh...bunker where they kept potatoes for the winter in the...uh...uh...next to the house and it was very uncomfortable.</span> <span id="s167">It was dark there, and it was cold.</span> <span id="s168">And I don't remember how long we stayed there.</span> <span id="s169">We must have stayed there about 2.</span> <span id="s170">.2 or 3 months because it was very cold.</span> <span id="s171">And the winter start...started coming and...uh...so he decided to transfer us to...he had a shack...a house next to him where he kept...uh...chickens.</span> <span id="s172">He had a little...like a chicken...uh.</span> <span id="s173">.</span> <span id="s174">house and also he had wood there for the winter.</span> <span id="s175">It was a shack.</span> <span id="s176">It was no isolation.</span> <span id="s177">Just wood put up from wood when those holes between the woods where I could...went away I used to look through the holes see what's going outside.</span> <span id="s178">The...I was in that shack hiding for almost 2 years.</span> <span id="s179">Never went outside.</span> <span id="s180">Uh...In the winter it was very cold.</span> <span id="s181">In the summer it was hot.</span> <span id="s182">And...uh...he used to bring us...uh...usually...uh...a loaf of bread for both of us every day and a bottle of water.</span> <span id="s183">Once in a blue moon for a special occasion he would bring a little soup and...uh...sometimes if...if he had to go away on business where they send him to another town for a day or some other he would...his wife or his daughter will never give us anything so we starved for a day or two until he came back.</span> <span id="s184">And my mother and I been in that...uh...uh... shack for... At night sometimes, my mother used to sneak out to clean out the pot and...uh...I never went out.</span> <span id="s185">Uh...She wouldn't let me out, and I was afraid too.</span> <span id="s186">She was...uh...we didn't have anything to do.</span> <span id="s187">I didn't have anything to play.</span> <span id="s188">I was at that time 6 years old, and I didn't know...I used to play with the chickens and play with the straws on the.</span> <span id="s189">There was a lot of straw on the floor and he...he put up the...uh...a kind of mattress or something where we slept in a corner with blankets and that was where we stayed and I used to play with the wood and I used to look out through those little holes in the...through the...uh...shack and see some people...uh...walking.</span> <span id="s190">Uh...Also, where he lived was at the edge of the town and there was a German section there where the Germans lived not too far and there was farms in back there.</span> <span id="s191">So...uh...because he was a policeman and he lived closed to the German section, the police...the Germans never came to his house to look for...uh...for any Jews.</span> <span id="s192">So that way we uh...there was...we survived it.</span> <span id="s193">Nobody came to check on us.</span> <span id="s194">Uh...It was...uh...I remember the winters we were very cold and a few times my legs almost froze, and I slept with all my clothes and everything.</span> <span id="s195">I don't remember how we washed or anything because I..</span> <span id="s196">.</span> <span id="s197">he used to bring one bottle of water and I don't remember if he gave us any more.</span> <span id="s198">Maybe sometime a bucket.</span> <span id="s199">I don't... Uh...I remember it was very boring sitting there day after day doing not much for a child.</span> <span id="s200">It was like a prison for me.</span> <span id="s201">Uh...uh...Lucky for us he died two weeks after the war.</span> <span id="s202">If he would've died a few days before the war, I am sure his family would have send us away to the Germans...throw us out from there because they been so afraid and they...they just didn't want anything to do with us.</span> <span id="s203">His wife at the last few weeks left.</span> <span id="s204">She was so...uh...afraid and when he died, we got out from there the first time the Russian came and there was a few Russian men came I remember.</span> <span id="s205">It was the first person I saw that I can talk this...talk to us.</span> <span id="s206">And my mother took care on him when he died and he died two weeks after it and...uh...we didn't...I don't think we knew what to do with ourselves because we didn't know anybody so I remember first time I walked out in the street and I didn't...I was walking and looking at people and I..</span> <span id="s207">.</span> <span id="s208">Everybody right away knew that I'm Jewish because I was walking so funny and looking so strange on everybody.</span> <span id="s209">I wasn't...uh...cause I didn't see people close to me and it was a new experience and I..</span> <span id="s210">.</span> <span id="s211">I didn't know how to behave.</span> <span id="s212">And...uh...after awhile I was afraid to walk til I went with my mother on the street.</span> <span id="s213">And...uh...my mother found some other Jews who came after the war and they...I remember a Jewish...uh...family... uh...shoemaker she knew.</span> <span id="s214">And she got a room somewhere, and we moved out...moved into a room where we lived there for a few months.</span> <span id="s215">And then she had...she went to...uh...I don't know how she...to court or something.</span> <span id="s216">She had to prove that this is her father's house and she got the...later had an apartment there.</span> <span id="s217">One room I remember in that house on LaBelska Street.</span> <span id="s218">And the...we went into that...uh...the... we moved into the house....uh...and we lived there a few...about a month I remember and my mother got sick.</span> <span id="s219">And...uh...we been all starving.</span> <span id="s220">After the war I looked like a stick.</span> <span id="s221">I was so skinny.</span> <span id="s222">And my mother was...we been all weak and I..</span> <span id="s223">.</span> <span id="s224">we barely could...I mean I..</span> <span id="s225">.</span> <span id="s226">walk.</span> <span id="s227">It was difficult because I was so skinny and I remember my mother must have been very skinny and she died a year afterwards.</span> <span id="s228">And I think it mostly malnutrition.</span> <span id="s229">Also she got a blood clout in her leg and she just wasn't able to survive.</span> <span id="s230">And I was the only one left.</span> <span id="s231">And there was a few Jews came and somehow...uh...I stayed with this family.</span> <span id="s232">The...the shoemaker...he kept me for a few months til there was...uh...some Jews who came looking for children survivors after the war.</span> <span id="s233">Then they...uh...got me...uh...uh...they arranged for me to be transferred to...to German to a children's home in a place called Goinstat near Mannheim.</span> <span id="s234">And...uh...I went there.</span> <span id="s235">They send me there with...somebody took me there.</span> <span id="s236">And it was like a children who they found after the war who survived.</span> <span id="s237">It was like an orphanage.</span> <span id="s238">And it was a very nice place actually.</span> <span id="s239">It was like a palace.</span> <span id="s240">I remember it was beautiful.</span> <span id="s241">It was so...such a big difference.</span> <span id="s242">And we...I stayed there I..</span> <span id="s243">.</span> <span id="s244">I think about 2 years.</span> <span id="s245">My mother left me the address of my uncle in Israel and my uncle in the United States and I wrote to my uncles a little bit.</span> <span id="s246">I went for a few months to...uh...in Poland after the war to school.</span> <span id="s247">They send me to a Polish school and...uh...I learned a little bit to write in Polish....uh...for a year...while I was there.</span> <span id="s248">I think I was there a year after that.</span> <span id="s249">And...uh...I was in Poland and learned...and I wrote to my uncle, and they started immediately arranged for me to come to Israel.</span> <span id="s250">Also my uncle from the United States was trying to get me to the United States, but...uh.</span> <span id="s251">.</span> <span id="s252">,to Israel the papers came first and I went to Israel.</span> <span id="s253">In Germany I was for 2 years and I learned Hebrew a little bit and some Polish, and I don't know...it mostly...</span></p> <p><span id="s254">And when the papers came to Israel I was so skinny and so weak that they send me to a special...I think it was like a hospital or a resort area or something where they tried to feed us and give us good...uh...so I gain a few pounds and I think I..</span> <span
