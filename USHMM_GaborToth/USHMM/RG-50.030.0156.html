id="s13">Q: Would you state your name and birth date please?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: My name Klaus Meier, and I was born on March 29 in 1932.</span> <span id="s15">I was born in Switzerland, near the city of Zurich, where my parents lived in a kind of a community, socialist, agnostic, semi-religious, because they felt that the only way people can live together in peace and harmony is by each one giving what he can and receiving only what he needs for life.</span> <span id="s16">My father will tell his own story.</span> <span id="s17">My mother has passed away already, but he was seeking for a long time to find this justice between people.</span> <span id="s18">As I said, I was born in a little farm there which they had rented.</span> <span id="s19">And while they were living in community there, they got to...into contact with another community which started in Germany 1920.</span> <span id="s20">I want to give a brief history of this community because it's important.</span> <span id="s21">Everett Arnold, a son of a missionary in Africa, sent there by the Arnold family from North America had also had this great longing in his heart to find what the way of Jesus is, the way of justice, peace and love, which the prophets and the Tennah speak all about all the time.</span> <span id="s22">And after much searching and seeking, (clearing throat) passing through the first World War, he felt that what is told in Acts 2 and 4, that they were one heart and one soul should be lived and practiced to meet this need for justice and love and peace.</span> <span id="s23">He started in Germany 1920, and he was always on the look, this man Everett Arnold and his wife, on the look out for other people who had similar longings.</span> <span id="s24">So he got into contact with my parents on the little community in Switzerland near Zurich.</span> <span id="s25">My father (clearing throat) was ...uh...he rejected...he took part in the military in Switzerland, but rejected it.</span> <span id="s26">He couldn't see killing people as being just and so he lost his...all his possibility for higher paid work.</span> <span id="s27">And on this farm they were milking cows, working in a cooperative and so on.</span> <span id="s28">The community in Germany called Bruderhof heard about his stand of non- violence, his refusal of military service, his going to prison for this in Switzerland, and Everett visited my father in prison and later on had contact always tried to encourage him not to give up community.</span> <span id="s29">The problem was that in a socialist agnostic community like my parents were in...as my father says, there's always as many ideas as there are idealists, and unless you find unity in community it will break apart.</span> <span id="s30">The tensions are too great.</span> <span id="s31">So in this Swiss community, they didn't find unity.</span> <span id="s32">The question of education, how to spend the money, how to work, what to...what part to take politically, all these questions divided the members.</span> <span id="s33">Whereas in the Bruderhof, the community in Germany, there was a unity which was possible.</span> <span id="s34">You could feel it, but it was Christian and my father couldn't stand Christianity as preached by the big world churches, the Catholics and the Protestants.</span> <span id="s35">Well, when I was 10 months old, my parents...this community in Switzerland didn't dissolve exactly, but one couple after the other went.</span> <span id="s36">.</span> <span id="s37">uh...because they were disappointed with the life of that community and joined the Bruderhof in Germany.</span> <span id="s38">And my parents joined that community in 1933, in February, a month after Hitler came to power.</span> <span id="s39">Right from the beginning...now this is what my parents tell me.</span> <span id="s40">Right from the beginning, Everett Arnold said to the whole community, to the members, "Hitler has come to power.</span> <span id="s41">Now we have to decide will we reject that nationalistic spirit?</span> <span id="s42">Are we willing to give our lives for what we believe or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">And on this question, some left.</span> <span id="s44">My parents stayed.</span> <span id="s45">On...I..</span> <span id="s46">.</span> <span id="s47">I had three other brothers born to my family in Germany.</span> <span id="s48">Andreas Meier, my second brother; Hansjurk Meier, and Daniel Meier.</span> <span id="s49">I do not remember any kind of persecution in Germany itself, but I remember fear.</span> <span id="s50">Just fear.</span> <span id="s51">And when I talked to my parents later about this whole question, they told me that already in 1933, there was six policeman who searched the community.</span> <span id="s52">Later on, in 1933, there was a referendum in Germany about whether....Hitler wanted to know if the German people support his policies.</span> <span id="s53">The members of the Bruderhof put little slips on the...on the voting papers, on the referendum papers, saying, "We respect the government, but we have a leader who is Jesus and we will not...we will serve only him.”</span> <span id="s54">When the...5 days after this referendum which was in November I believe...uh...there was a big group of Nazi of Gestapo...Nazi soldiers and policemen came and raided the community.</span> <span id="s55">They took away books with red covers, proving that we were communists.</span> <span id="s56">They took away minutes of our meetings and...uh...so this went on.</span> <span id="s57">My father then was sent to take important documents to Switzerland out of the reach of the Nazis.</span> <span id="s58">My father was then sent with another Swiss man to the Gestapo headquarters in Berlin to find out what they had in mind with us.</span> <span id="s59">Everett Arnold always felt we have to go to top men to find out, and not to the second, third or fourth echelon in the power structure.</span> <span id="s60">In Berlin, my father went to the headquarters and they got in there which was also a fearful thing I think, and the man there told them that he had enough reason to dissolve the Bruderhof right because in one of our meetings, Everett had said that the Nazi state shows the character of all states, but it showed it clearest of being from the beast of the , which according to CHristian beliefs in the book of Revelation is the opposite of God's love.</span> <span id="s61">The beast of the is the opposite of God...of God.</span> <span id="s62">So this Nazi man said, "Just for having said that, we must dissolve you because you are against everything which the Nazi government represents.”</span> <span id="s63">Then...so I heard this from my father, and then I know that in 1934, the Nazis sent a school inspector into our private school which they had asked the children to sing the national anthem which they couldn't.</span> <span id="s64">We had not taught that.</span> <span id="s65">And they said, "We will close your school or send German teachers.”</span> <span id="s66">This we could not tolerate, so we took our children to Germany.</span> <span id="s67">My father was instrumental in this.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">In Switzerland, our school children were rejected.</span> <span id="s69">They did not get permission to enter Switzerland.</span> <span id="s70">The Swiss government said, "Be obedient to your government.</span> <span id="s71">Why take your children out?"</span> <span id="s72">So they did not understand us.</span> <span id="s73">And for this...</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: You recall...what part do you recall as how it affected you?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: I was then...uh...2, 3 years old.</span> <span id="s76">I was not in this school children who left who were in Bruderhof.</span> <span id="s77">I stayed on the Bruderhof with my parents being Swiss and in some way protected from the...from the Nazis, from the German officials.</span> <span id="s78">But I remember then for myself as the death of my fourth...third brother, Daniel Meier.</span> <span id="s79">He was born in on March 29, 1937.</span> <span id="s80">And I remember my father taking me to my mother in the Fulda hospital to see this little baby.</span> <span id="s81">And the 14 days after he was born, came the raid which... where the Gestapo...uh...confiscated and destroyed the community as such.</span> <span id="s82">They occu...they came in the early morning.</span> <span id="s83">I remember that.</span> <span id="s84">They surrounded the whole community and they told everybody to get into the dining room.</span> <span id="s85">Leave the rooms, the kitchen, the laundry.</span> <span id="s86">Just leave everything and be in the dining room.</span> <span id="s87">I don't remember getting and ask questions or so but I remember the picture and the fear which...which I had.</span> <span id="s88">And the governments...the...the Nazis said, "Leave right away.”</span> <span id="s89">But there was my mother 14 year old baby...and the weather was bad.</span> <span id="s90">There was some sick people.</span> <span id="s91">So we asked them to let us go when the weather is a bit better and we...so they let us stay there l day longer.</span> <span id="s92">And then I remember how with a bundle on the shoulder, we all got...they took us into buses and they took us to a train...I believe in Fulda.</span> <span id="s93">I'm not ...I'm not quite clear to which city.</span> <span id="s94">I think it was Fulda.</span> <span id="s95">And on the train, then they took us to the Dutch boundary and pushed us over the border.</span> <span id="s96">I've often wondered why my father went to the...to prison in Fulda for various reasons, the Nazis can't close the community as because they figured we were enemies of the state.</span> <span id="s97">But when they found out there were two Hutterian brothers and I have to explain this, present from North America, they changed the accusation into criminal bankruptcy to have a legal handle to get rid of us.</span> <span id="s98">Now I remember these two brothers.</span> <span id="s99">And they are descendants of ...uh...people that in the 60th Century in Austria, Switzerland, Moravia, which is today Czechoslovakia, began a life in community like we live it today.</span> <span id="s100">And they were persecuted by the Catholics to death.</span> <span id="s101">By the Catholics, the Protestants, the churches and the governments.</span> <span id="s102">They found refuge in Moravia because hundred years before this, , there was a spiritual awaking and there was more tolerance in Czechoslovakia than in the rest of the Austrian empires.</span> <span id="s103">And we Hutterians were persecuted.</span> <span id="s104">I think more than two thousand were burned, killed, decapitated or drowned, whatever they did, and they fled from Moravia into Hungary, then later on to Russia.</span> <span id="s105">They lost the community life on two occasions, and it started again.</span> <span id="s106">On hundred years ago, in 1874, they migrated to the United States because the Russian who had promised them exemption of military service, wanted to force them to do military service.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">But they refused and migrated.</span> <span id="s108">Now, two of these...excuse me, I have to go back now.</span> <span id="s109">Everett Arnold and the Bruderhof in Germany, when they heard in 1928 about that there were...that none of the Hutterian brothers had done military service in the world war; that they had been persecuted economically and with hate and in the United States for not being anti-German in the first world war, many of them were taken prisoners and two of them were taken to Alcatraz and later on to Fort Levinsworth, and they died from exposure because of the treatment they got from the American military.</span> <span id="s110">After they had died, there were...they put the uniforms on and sent the bodies home.</span> <span id="s111">They refused to put the uniform on while they lived.</span> <span id="s112">This we heard in Germany, published in the Mennonite newspaper.</span> <span id="s113">And Everett and the Bruderhof felt here is a group that unanimously stick to their principles, even unto death.</span> <span id="s114">This is something we have to know.</span> <span id="s115">So Everett himself went in 1930 to the Hutterian communities in South Dakota, North Dakota, and I believe some over in Canada; visited them all and united with them, 1930.</span> <span id="s116">He came back in at the end of 30, I think, or at beginning of 31.</span> <span id="s117">Hitler came to power in 33.</span> <span id="s118">And in 1937, two of these American and Canadian brothers were visiting the community in Germany just the time when the Nazis...uh...confiscated the whole lot.</span> <span id="s119">When...the Gestapo searched everything, they met up with these two and they pulled out their American passports and said, "Sorry, we don't allow this.</span> <span id="s120">You cannot search us.</span> <span id="s121">We are American citizens.”</span> <span id="s122">And there the Gestapo got afraid about propaganda in...in America and changed the accusation from, as I said, enemy of the state to criminal bankruptcy which my father can tell how that worked.</span> <span id="s123">So we left then Germany in 1937 and I..</span> <span id="s124">.</span> <span id="s125">I thought a lot about why...why is it that all of us escaped without a single one dying in the concentration camp or in prison?</span> <span id="s126">And I don't really know the answer except that I believe God protected us.</span> <span id="s127">But I know from our side we did not compromise at any point with the Nazis.</span> <span id="s128">We did not raise an arm in salute.</span> <span id="s129">We did not go along with his politics.</span> <span id="s130">We didn't try to...uh... sort of inch our way in and be friends.</span> <span id="s131">We all...not I. I was a child.</span> <span id="s132">But the brothers and sisters and always said clearly where they stood.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: How...how did it affect you at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: As I said, I was 5 years old.</span> <span id="s135">I was just afraid.</span> <span id="s136">That's all I know, and from...from Germany.</span> <span id="s137">At certain times, I was afraid.</span> <span id="s138">And other times, I was a child growing up in this community very much cared and loved for.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: Do you have any memories of what was going on in the community to your community that caused this fear in you?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: Uh...I..</span> <span id="s141">.</span> <span id="s142">I'm told that also before 37, there were different raids going on.</span> <span id="s143">And my father was away often for the community in Switzerland finding refuge for the children.</span> <span id="s144">Later on in 35, when the general conscription started, he was off trying to help people.</span> <span id="s145">His absence I feel I must have felt that as a child.</span> <span id="s146">This is...this is what I can say.</span> <span id="s147">But apart from...from this fear I'm talking about, I had a very protected childhood.</span> <span id="s148">It was in...within the community, it was protected.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: How did the community protect you?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: I..</span> <span id="s151">.</span> <span id="s152">bY the...I think it was by the...by the love and the confidence that God would led this...see this thing through.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: How did your community live at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: Our community lived on a farm.</span> <span id="s155">I'm not quite sure how many acres.</span> <span id="s156">They were farming.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">They were learning to farm because in the beginning 1920, they were all city people, professors and intellectuals, but they were determined to ...to agriculture, and the farming was difficult.</span> <span id="s158">The land was hard and they had a lot of work needed to establish a farm.</span> <span id="s159">We lived in community houses like the kibbutz do today.</span> <span id="s160">We had our own school and preschool and kindergarten.</span> <span id="s161">Children were educated in their age groups by members of the community.</span> <span id="s162">So the influence from the outside was very low or nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: Was the community self sufficient?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: It was self sufficient up to a point.</span> <span id="s165">We took...the community took in any kind of wayfarer...overnight gave him food and lodging.</span> <span id="s166">Asking them to work, which they did mostly rejected.</span> <span id="s167">We had many visitors, and economically we were doing bad.</span> <span id="s168">Not because...so much because of inexperience, but right from 1933 on, the Nazi government tried to strangle us economically.</span> <span id="s169">How this exactly worked, I'm not sure, but I heard that at one point they...they forbid...they didn't give us the license to sell our products.</span> <span id="s170">We farmed.</span> <span id="s171">We had wood tannery, and we printed books.</span> <span id="s172">And the sale of books and tannery was part of the cash income, where as the farm was the food.</span> <span id="s173">We...we never sold food.</span> <span id="s174">We always just grew food for our own use.</span> <span id="s175">And when the...when police...uh...prohibited us from selling then this took away cash and that made it difficult.</span> <span id="s176">There was a time in Germany when we had friends outside Germany who gave us money, which was stuck in Germany.</span> <span id="s177">I forget what the term is.</span> <span id="s178">They didn't allow foreign...foreign currency to get out of Germany, so friends gave us that money and the banks in Germany would not give us the money.</span> <span id="s179">So they made our life more and more diffuclt.</span> <span id="s180">We took in children from broken homes and needy situations, which the German government of the Weimer republic had paid for.</span> <span id="s181">They gave a certain amount of money.</span> <span id="s182">Well, this was stopped.</span> <span id="s183">And so here we were with the children and not getting an help either.</span> <span id="s184">So this is what made the economic situation very difficult and more and more so.</span> <span id="s185">They forbid guests of staying overnight which we didn't listen to.</span> <span id="s186">We didn't accept that.</span> <span id="s187">And...uh... (clearing throat) so now I think I got to the point that we came to Holland, and my personal story.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: How old were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: I was then 5 years.</span> <span id="s190">And I remember one of the Hutterian brothers carrying my little brother of 2 weeks....of 2 weeks of age in his arms, and my mother...we all had a bundle on our back and left.</span> <span id="s191">I'm very thankful that we could leave.</span> <span id="s192">Many, many others could not leave or did not leave in time.</span> <span id="s193">In Holland, the group called the Mennonites took us in very warmly.</span> <span id="s194">The Mennonites are a group that also started in the 16th Century and belonged to the so-called anti-baptist movement, and they started in Switzerland if I remember correctly, but fled to Holland whereas the Hutterians went to Moravia and Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: How many of you did they take in in Holland?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: I think we were about 50 people.</span> <span id="s197">Let me say something.</span> <span id="s198">In 1933, we were about 120, but when the children had to be... had to leave Germany, we started a new community in Lichenstein.</span> <span id="s199">And members of the German community had to move over to Lichenstein to support this group of children.</span> <span id="s200">So that was also a weakening of the economic situation, to hold...to maintain two communities is much more difficult than one.</span> <span id="s201">So when the Nazis confiscated the place, I think we were about 50 people...children and grownups.</span> <span id="s202">Some when to the Lichenstein community called Bruderhof, and the others went to England where we had already started a community because of the tense political situation in Germany.</span> <span id="s203">The young men who received military service in Germany escaped illegally across the boundary and went to Lichenstein.</span> <span id="s204">And in Lichenstein the government was very friendly to us, and gave us refuge.</span> <span id="s205">And when Hitler started to put his fingers out for these resisters in Lichenstein, they let us know about it, and they said, "Get out of here fast.</span> <span id="s206">Hitler is asking about...not Hitler personally, but the German government.”</span> <span id="s207">So when this happened we needed to find a place somewhere else to go to.</span> <span id="s208">And this place we found in German...in England.</span> <span id="s209">So as we left Germany in 1937, there was already a community in England.</span> <span id="s210">We tried to get into England, but couldn't because they wanted an affidavit of support, the British government.</span> <span id="s211">So the Mennonites took us in for 2 months, and they...we slept in their church buildings, in their homes.</span> <span id="s212">They gave us toys.</span> <span id="s213">They made collection amongst themselves for toys, for blankets, for food.</span> <span id="s214">Everything they...they simply supported us for 2 months.</span> <span id="s215">I remember very well we never had any roller scooters if...if that's what you call two wheels on a board and a handle.</span> <span id="s216">In Germany, we...we didn't have enough money for such things, but in Holland, there were nice, black topped paths and roads and we got these roller scooters with rubber tires.</span> <span id="s217">Not wooden, but rubber, and we scouted around.</span> <span id="s218">That was wonderful.</span> <span id="s219">Now (clearing throat) I'm told that I wrote a letter from Holland to my father who was in prison with the Nazis in Fulda, and in that letter I did...I didn't write, I dictated this to my mother saying, "If the government...German government doesn't let my father free, I'm going to come with the whole...and knock the prison down.”</span> <span id="s220">My father received this letter in prison and everybody laughed about it.</span> <span id="s221">And then I remember when we traveled to England, we crossed the channel on a boat.</span> <span id="s222">And we were a group of 30 or 40 people...children, mostly children and...uh...some of our brothers and sisters from England came over to help us.</span> <span id="s223">And one of them was called Adolph Brown.</span> <span id="s224">He was a very hugh man, 6 feet or more, and quite a..</span> <span id="s225">.</span> <span id="s226">quite heavyset, and he took...he took care of me and my brother because my father wasn't there.</span> <span id="s227">And I remember crossing the Channel on a boat.</span> <span id="s228">Then we came to England.</span> <span id="s229">And in England, we had started this community called the Bruderhof, near .</span> <span id="s230">I'm not quite sure geographically where it's situated.</span> <span id="s231">And this community was also a agricultural community, and we started farming right away.</span> <span id="s232">We built houses and in England then all, the whole community gathered.</span> <span id="s233">From Lichenstein, Germany 150 people about altogether.</span> <span id="s234">There was an increasing war fever because Hitler was doing his thing, and everybody was getting ready.</span> <span id="s235">And so it was a time of decision.</span> <span id="s236">And many English people felt that violence is not the answer to human problems, and so in the 4 years we spent in England from 37 to 40...or 36 to 40, the size of the community doubled with English.</span> <span id="s237">.</span> <span id="s238">uh...men and women, married and single, old and young, who felt that a life in community without wages, working together, serving each other instead of expecting service, was the answer to our human needs.</span> <span id="s239">And so the community doubled in this size.</span> <span id="s240">We had this one community, .</span> <span id="s241">We had another farm close by, 5 miles, called Telling farm, and Bruderhof, the third one.</span> <span id="s242">And I remember this time quite well.</span> <span id="s243">I was 5 to 9...9 years of age.</span> <span id="s244">And maybe what could help most for the...for my story now is that there was a time when in England when all the windows had to be black outed.</span> <span id="s245">I believe that was when the war started.</span> <span id="s246">And so we did this.</span> <span id="s247">We had built three houses in willow trees along the brooks.</span> <span id="s248">All these tree houses were taken down because the English people were afraid we would be signaling the German airplanes.</span> <span id="s249">Being Germans.</span> <span id="s250">They forgot we had escaped.</span> <span id="s251">They just saw us as Germans.</span> <span id="s252">The...I wasn't German.</span> <span id="s253">I'm Swiss.</span> <span id="s254">But they.</span> <span id="s255">.</span> <span id="s256">they made us take all these treehouses down.</span> <span id="s257">They took...put concrete pillows in the meadows so we wouldn't let the German airplanes land and they even...uh...made ditches so that nothing could... They were very scared of us.</span> <span id="s258">And I..</span> <span id="s259">.</span> <span id="s260">I'm very sorry for that because I..</span> <span id="s261">.</span> <span id="s262">I don't understand it.</span> <span id="s263">They were so scared of us that this fear turned into hatehood, and on one occasion, at least, the surrounding...some of the surrounding population came half drunk, enraged, to burn the community down.</span> <span id="s264">The atmosphere in England was very warlike atmosphere.</span> <span id="s265">You either were for the English and against the Germans or you were an enemy.</span> <span id="s266">This kind of thing.</span> <span id="s267">The community supported itself partly also by having a merry-go-ground, a vegetable ground, bread, butter, eggs.</span> <span id="s268">This was finished from one day to the other nearly, because they feared...rumors were going around that we were putting poison in the milk to kill English children.</span> <span id="s269">So this atmosphere also I felt as a child living in England.</span> <span id="s270">We had many air raid practices, living in the 3rd floors of the manor house getting into the bottom.</span> <span id="s271">I remember packages of dried banana and some chocolate and nuts in case we were stuck down there.</span> <span id="s272">And I remember also that...uh...a German bomb dropped very close or on our property while we were in England.</span> <span id="s273">This all made an atmosphere of fear, which I also felt.</span> <span id="s274">But within the community I..</span> <span id="s275">.</span> <span id="s276">I felt safe.</span> <span id="s277">It...it wasn't a personal feeling.</span> <span id="s278">It was a general...a feeling of...of...uh.</span> <span id="s279">.</span> <span id="s280">of war.</span> <span id="s281">Now, I also remember that while we were in England, we were approached by a Zionist group and asked if we could train some Jewish people in the , preparation for kibbutz life.</span> <span id="s282">And I think 40 or 50 came and spent some time with us, learning to work in agriculture.</span> <span id="s283">And when I went to Israel now in 1985, I came to kibbutz Hasara, with my father and some others, and we met some of these who have been in our community 40 years ago, which was very interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: Do you know where these people came from?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: Where they came from?</span> <span id="s286">No.</span> <span id="s287">But I think...no, I don't.</span> <span id="s288">And from Europe, from Germany, Austria, probably I think.</span> <span id="s289">Then the community also took in Jewish orphan children from Austria, from Vienna.</span> <span id="s290">We had friends who asked if we could help and we...I'm not sure of the number.</span> <span id="s291">I hear about maybe 12 children.</span> <span id="s292">And one of them, Lotta Berger, who came Vienna who had lost her parents....they were killed...came to us and she is still with us today.</span> <span id="s293">She married.</span> <span id="s294">She became a member and she married under the family, a very good friend of mine.</span> <span id="s295">And (clearing throat) so we lived there in England.</span> <span id="s296">And then in 1940, and in 1939, because of the antagonism of the surrounding people...the government was friendly to us, but the people were very afraid of anything German.</span> <span id="s297">So the government hinted to us it might be better to leave the country because if the tension grew, they would have to intern us for our own sake.</span> <span id="s298">Another thing which happened to us in England was because of this war fever which could be compared to what happened in North America with the Japanese and the West Coast after Pearl Harbor, this kind of psychosis or whatever it is, made it that the...the police said, "No Bruderhof member could pass the radius of 5 miles outside the community.”</span> <span id="s299">And when somebody did that they, this was illegal.</span> <span id="s300">They got us...we could get permission to leave further than 5 miles, but we had to get permission every time.</span> <span id="s301">This was another thing I remember.</span> <span id="s302">I remember the German airplanes flying overhead.</span> <span id="s303">You could hear by the noise of the motors that they were German airplanes.</span> <span id="s304">I don't...I cannot explain it.</span> <span id="s305">I was told this.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">And they...they bombed Coventry, of course and Birmingham and many cities.</span> <span id="s307">In our community, we always represented that we have to love the enemy.</span> <span id="s308">Not only the fellow man, but also the enemy because only love can break the vicious cycle of violence.</span> <span id="s309">I kill you.</span> <span id="s310">You kill me.</span> <span id="s311">This kind of thing can only be broken and this is what I understand is God's will for us actually, that we should love people and leave the revenge to God as is spoken about many times by the prophets especially.</span> <span id="s312">So then when the government hinted that it's better for us to leave, my father was sent to North America in 1940 to find out if we could come to North America or Canada, because we are brothers over here.</span> <span id="s313">And in Canada they wouldn't let us in.</span> <span id="s314">They had enough trouble with those COs, conscientious objectors living in Canada.</span> <span id="s315">Our brothers in South Dakota offered us a whole farm, ready with housing, machinery and everything.</span> <span id="s316">So my father went to the...came to New York, came to Washington, lived in the student union down here in Washington for 3 months and from there traveled with another brother to Canada, South Dakota, trying to find the help that we could immigrate to the United States.</span> <span id="s317">The government was very much in favor.</span> <span id="s318">My father breakfasted with Eleanor Roosevelt.</span> <span id="s319">She was in favor of us coming, but she said her husband needs to make the decision.</span> <span id="s320">There was different Senators who tried to help us, but there was a election campaign of President Roosevelt, and we were advised it's not good to come at this point.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Wait til January or February after the inauguration.</span> <span id="s322">As I think about this, the question comes why?</span> <span id="s323">Well, we all have clothing like I have it now.</span> <span id="s324">Black clothing, beards, which in those days were very rare.</span> <span id="s325">We don't salute the flag.</span> <span id="s326">I don't salute the flag.</span> <span id="s327">I have respect for the government, but I can't pledge allegiance for instance.</span> <span id="s328">It goes against my conscience.</span> <span id="s329">And so all these things made the government aware that it might not be a good moment to come in.</span> <span id="s330">And then my father went to the Mexican government to see if he could go there.</span> <span id="s331">It didn't work out.</span> <span id="s332">And then the Mennonites again helped us to find a place in Paraguay, South America, which is in the heart of South America.</span> <span id="s333">We didn't know where this place was.</span> <span id="s334">We looked it up on the map.</span> <span id="s335">Now, my father was in America.</span> <span id="s336">I was still in England in the community.</span> <span id="s337">And when we heard we could travel to South America, Paraguay, we started reading books about the place because we'd never even heard of it.</span> <span id="s338">And we read about snakes and jungles and monkeys and...uh...diseases, all kind of things.</span> <span id="s339">And then the British government made possible for us to sell everything, get the value of it, and they made it possible for us to take everything we needed out of the country.</span> <span id="s340">And I and my family with...together with, I think, 70 of the community, we were on the first group.</span> <span id="s341">We left England in 1940 I think.</span> <span id="s342">39 or 40, I'm not quite sure.</span> <span id="s343">We went...traveled in buses to Burn, to Liverpool, spent the night there in a hotel which I remember from...went to the third floor.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">There was big beds and everything, but there was always the danger of bombers, of course, in the night so we had to be ready to...to run down the stairs and into the shelters.</span> <span id="s345">Nothing happened that night, and I remember getting on to this ship called , which the British government used to bring meat in from Argentina specially.</span> <span id="s346">And they had one class, which was first class, and then it was a freight ship actually.</span> <span id="s347">So 80 of us got on this ship and then everything was black out.</span> <span id="s348">And I remember the ship sailing or steaming or whatever you call it...criss-crossed their way sub...uh...submarine attacks.</span> <span id="s349">This was at the height of the submarine war when the Germans more or less controlled the ocean around England.</span> <span id="s350">So it...that was also dangerous, and we were aware of this.</span> <span id="s351">I was 9 years, and I remember how on this ship then, I once had...I had a flashlight and I took it out in the gun ware and shone it, and everybody came and really hushed me up because that was a dangerous thing to do.</span> <span id="s352">I wasn't aware of what I was doing, but there was great fear of anything like that.</span> <span id="s353">We had a very nice time on the ship.</span> <span id="s354">I enjoyed it very much.</span> <span id="s355">They gave us very good food in the first class, and there was a big library and films and everything.</span> <span id="s356">I was aware of the situation but not to the depth of it.</span> <span id="s357">As a child...I was a 9 year old, I enjoyed it also very much.</span> <span id="s358">We crossed the Equator and came to Rio de Janeiro, the first city we saw in full lights at night.</span> <span id="s359">It was a wonderful sight.</span> <span id="s360">Then we went to Buenos Aires, transferred from the oceanliner to a river boat, and there I saw my father again.</span> <span id="s361">He had gone through Brazil and Paraguay and looked at different possibilities and met us in Argentina, but you couldn't come on the ship because we were only...they'd only...uh...pass us through...cross Argentina.</span> <span id="s362">We...we couldn't...this was under police escort and we were put on a bus with all the luggage and police escorted us from the oceanliner to the river boat, so that nobody could run away and get into Argentina.</span> <span id="s363">So we traveled up this river, Paraguay Parana, 4, 5 days at least.</span> <span id="s364">Third class.</span> <span id="s365">It got hotter and hotter and hotter and hotter.</span> <span id="s366">We ended up in Ascunion, Paraguay, I think at Christmas time, which is south of the equator; therefore, it's the hottest time of the year.</span> <span id="s367">And then we transferred to another boat and went up the Paraguay River another 4 or 5 days til we came to , which is very close to northern...to Brazil in the northern part of Paraguay.</span> <span id="s368">There we got...uh...unto to a train without bump...without cushion bumpers without...it was a freight train.</span> <span id="s369">We couldn't drink water.</span> <span id="s370">It all had to be coffee.</span> <span id="s371">So I was trying...I was remember the part of Paraguay Ascunion.</span> <span id="s372">The...the food on the living conditions on this boat was very bad.</span> <span id="s373">We were on the bottom of the boat.</span> <span id="s374">I think there were three or four tiers of beds, or bunks, and I remember now, there are no lights on this river.</span> <span id="s375">The Captain has to steer the boat by the seat of his pants, as one says.</span> <span id="s376">The river rises and falls and the sand banks come and go.</span> <span id="s377">It's wild.</span> <span id="s378">And the boat gets...the boats gets stuck sometimes on sand banks and ...uh...so we were the only one that traveled in the bottom of the boat.</span> <span id="s379">The next groups and there were maybe 10 more, they traveled first class or second class for safety's sake.</span> <span id="s380">So we got up to this Chaco station...uh... , and there we took the train 144 to kilometer 144.</span> <span id="s381">Now you can imagine.</span> <span id="s382">There were young babies, mothers, expecting mothers, fathers, everything...old people, young people, on this train traveling 144 kilometers into the bush.</span> <span id="s383">Another name for the Chaco is Green Hell.</span> <span id="s384">And I can't confirm it is...it is Hell.</span> <span id="s385">Many sand storms; hardly any water; very hot, and very inhos...inhospitable; poisonous snakes.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">You name it.</span> <span id="s387">Tarantulas, diseases.</span> <span id="s388">All this is there.</span> <span id="s389">And kilometer 144 we had to wait.</span> <span id="s390">We were heading toward Mennonite colonies, and if you remember I said that in Holland, Mennonites had helped us.</span> <span id="s391">When our immigration to the United States was not possible, again, Mennonites helped us find this place in Paraguay and they alerted their members there to...we are coming and so kilometer 144, we waited.</span> <span id="s392">It got dust.</span> <span id="s393">Some horses wagons were supposed to arrive to fetch us.</span> <span id="s394">They didn't come.</span> <span id="s395">They didn't come.</span> <span id="s396">But in the end they came.</span> <span id="s397">I think there must have been 20 wagons.</span> <span id="s398">Horse wagons from 2 horses to a wagon with wooden wheels, metal rimmed.</span> <span id="s399">We put our baggage on and everybody got on and we started off.</span> <span id="s400">It was so dusty you choked and could hardly see anything.</span> <span id="s401">We drove...we went through the night and stopped for a couple of hours.</span> <span id="s402">Around midnight, scared of snakes, but no...nobody got bit.</span> <span id="s403">And the next day, we arrived at this colony in the Gran Chaco of Paraguay called Sanheim, where Mennonites who had fled from Russia and who had come from Canada I think to avoid public education by the government.</span> <span id="s404">They wanted their own schools.</span> <span id="s405">They'd come to this place in the Chaco in 19...in the 20s, so by 1940, they were quite well established.</span> <span id="s406">But they told us about many difficult hardships which they experienced there.</span> <span id="s407">Now, when we got there, they had prepared a banquet for us in their church.</span> <span id="s408">Long tables, white table cloths, coffee with milk and sugar, home baked bread with butter, and home made cheese, and I can still taste it to this day if I think of it.</span> <span id="s409">It was so good.</span> <span id="s410">The families slept in the school houses which the Mennonites had.</span> <span id="s411">It was holidays and...uh...I remember we stayed about 2 months.</span> <span id="s412">And while we were staying there, the...the...my father and others looked around for a suitable place where the community could settle, where we could start building houses and live a community life again.</span> <span id="s413">And they traveled around.</span> <span id="s414">This I hear.</span> <span id="s415">I..</span> <span id="s416">.</span> <span id="s417">I didn't do it myself.</span> <span id="s418">They traveled around.</span> <span id="s419">It was very difficult to find any place, because wherever you go, you needed water.</span> <span id="s420">And the water in that Chaco part is all brackish water, very hard, but bitter and to find a sweet water well was a rare thing.</span> <span id="s421">The other thing that concerned us as we lived there for 2 months, we heard that the whole Chaco is a military area under the...under the government of the military institution, which we also didn't like too much.</span> <span id="s422">Now, I remember as a child...oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s423">When we were there, my...let me think.</span> <span id="s424">I have three brothers...four brothers live in Germany, and in England a sister was born in my family, Verena, and then another sister, Hannabeth, and the third sister was born in the Chaco right there in the Mennonites...there with the Mennonites.</span> <span id="s425">They had a hospital there.</span> <span id="s426">Our communities had brought 3 doctors who had joined the community in England, and they came out with us and this doctor was there, and helped my mother in...in the time of delivering.</span> <span id="s427">Other children were born there.</span> <span id="s428">So I would like to say that in this whole process of fleeing for conscious sake, there were quite a few things to consider.</span> <span id="s429">Pregnant mothers, little babies.</span> <span id="s430">These things.</span> <span id="s431">I remember meeting Indians in the Chaco.</span> <span id="s432">They were so-called wild Indians with loin cloth and...uh...the feathers they had in their hair, but they were all very friendly.</span> <span id="s433">And as I was told, these Indians also had a type of community life.</span> <span id="s434">They...if somebody got something, they brought it to the oldest woman in the tribe, and she would then distribute to each one as you needed.</span> <span id="s435">They cared for each other and helped each other.</span> <span id="s436">And for this reason, we felt quite close to them.</span> <span id="s437">My father tells me that he met some of the...of the leaders of the , of the Indian tribe, and they gave us some land.</span> <span id="s438">And my father asked him, "How much do we pay?"</span> <span id="s439">And the Indian said, "One dollar.”</span> <span id="s440">And then the brothers asked shall we sign a document, the Indian said, "No.</span> <span id="s441">Shake hands on this.</span> <span id="s442">That's enough.</span> <span id="s443">We feel...we feel something from you which doesn't require any legal documents.”</span> <span id="s444">In the end, we decided not to stay in the Chaco.</span> <span id="s445">It was too difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">The agriculture was too bad.</span> <span id="s447">It was too hot, and then this military question played also into it.</span> <span id="s448">So then the brothers went to what is called East...east Paraguay, Paraguay, and there along side some other Mennonite colonies, we found a big...not an estate, a big...uh...cattle ranch.</span> <span id="s449">I think four thousand acres or something like that, maybe more.</span> <span id="s450">And the man wanted to sell us and we bought part of this.</span> <span id="s451">And we called it...it was called Priwara, which means Spring.</span> <span id="s452">So when this became clear, we all got on a truck and they drove us out on the truck to the train station.</span> <span id="s453">We got back to kilometer 144, drove to Kasaro, got on a boat, and went down 2 days I think...2 days and a night, to a place called Protorosario, which means Rosario Port, and there again Mennonites fetched us with their horse wagons.</span> <span id="s454">We drove 60 kilometers inland to this new place which we had acquired.</span> <span id="s455">There were no buildings on this place.</span> <span id="s456">It was nothing.</span> <span id="s457">It was just wild woods...uh...plains, swamp, and while the members of the...the men of the community start to build houses, we children stayed with the Mennonites in their schools, in their homes...I think again for at least l or 2 months.</span> <span id="s458">And then finally we could all move up to the Primiwara, and start our community life again.</span> <span id="s459">As I think about the whole thing, from the sake of conscious, my parents started from scrap just about every 10 years.</span> <span id="s460">In Switzerland were scrapped and they went to Germany, they started from with nothing, with the Bruderhof, and the left that, went to England.</span> <span id="s461">So and that is a difficult thing, to start with nothing, everything l0 years is quite something.</span> <span id="s462">Now in Primawara, we started building houses.</span> <span id="s463">Uh...In that country, there is a lot of timber, so we had to get timber.</span> <span id="s464">You cut the trees yourself.</span> <span id="s465">You can't buy it.</span> <span id="s466">You cut the trees in the forest.</span> <span id="s467">You bring them out what they call , which is a contraption consisting of two enormous wheels 6 feet high, big wheels with an axle, pulled by 12 oxens and the log maybe 30, 50 60 feet long is balanced under this axle and the oxen pull it out of the wood and then you cut it up by hand.</span> <span id="s468">You can imagine this was all a lot of work for everybody.</span> <span id="s469">We built four big halls, a roof, no walls, no interior walls, and with just curtains separating the different families and there we stayed until we could build better housing.</span> <span id="s470">We started right away with agriculture, which is basically all we knew.</span> <span id="s471">We start with tannery, wooden tannery.</span> <span id="s472">In Paraguay, there's some wonderful woods, exotic woods, which make beautiful vases, sugar bowls, candle holders, things like that which people buy.</span> <span id="s473">So we went into tannery and agriculture.</span> <span id="s474">We started our own school there, and I remember that there were 3 woods.</span> <span id="s475">It's hot in Paraguay.</span> <span id="s476">It's sub-tropical country, and...uh...summer it goes up to l00, very humid.</span> <span id="s477">Every day a thunderstorm, and winter it goes down to 32 degrees, 33 fahrenheit.</span> <span id="s478">There was a little bit of ice, no snow, but cold because we were not used...having hot weather all the time...to this cold weather.</span> <span id="s479">So in this place called Priawara, there were three wood islands.</span> <span id="s480">The first one...the first one we cleared and built a dining room, communal kitchen and a store house.</span> <span id="s481">And the second little wood which was maybe 100, maybe 200 yards away, was the preschool and the kindergarten (clearing throat) and in the third one we cleared...and I remember with machetes we cleared the cactus on the brush, and then we...there we built some school houses, school rooms, where all the children were educated.</span> <span id="s482">We had our own teachers which we always wanted.</span> <span id="s483">We...we feel that in this community life, we want to have certain values.</span> <span id="s484">Values of love, peace, justice, and we...(clearing throat) we know that the teachers have to have the same values as the parents for a school to be...uh....wholeheartedly going in one direction.</span> <span id="s485">So this we had our own school with our own teachers.</span> <span id="s486">It was difficult, but other people died so simply by being able to live, it was a great...a great thing already.</span> <span id="s487">In Paraguay we stayed til 1960.</span> <span id="s488">I lived there for 20 years.</span> <span id="s489">I also lived part of my life in Uruguay, and also a country in South America, Montediveo.</span> <span id="s490">(Clearing throat) While we were in Paraguay, there were some revolutions.</span> <span id="s491">There're always revolutions somewhere going on.</span> <span id="s492">And we were on the...on the battle line...uh...different parties winning and losing.</span> <span id="s493">They always asked us to help them supply wagons with horses to carry the ammunition and the soldiers.</span> <span id="s494">We always refused this.</span> <span id="s495">If a soldier's hungry, we give him food.</span> <span id="s496">If he's hurt, we'll help him, but we will not take part in furthering military objectives in any way.</span> <span id="s497">And this was dangerous.</span> <span id="s498">My father, again, was...he had to meet these officers and they threatened to kill him more than once by not...by refusing to help.</span> <span id="s499">But I feel that by holding on to values which one has, it's the best thing we can do.</span> <span id="s500">If one starts compromising, it gets...one gets on slippery ground very fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: What was the government's reaction...</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: The Paraguayan government was...is a Catholic government complete.</span> <span id="s503">The whole country is Catholic.</span> <span id="s504">They took us in because they needed people on the...on the land working agriculture.</span> <span id="s505">Paraguay is a country which lost...I don't know exact the figures, but they had a big war with Bolivia, Argentina and Brazil, and they lost enormous amount of people there, especially men and boys.</span> <span id="s506">So they needed people to come to the country.</span> <span id="s507">Not business people in the cities, but on the country.</span> <span id="s508">And therefore the Paraguayan government gave us religious freedom.</span> <span id="s509">We were not Catholics.</span> <span id="s510">They gave us complete authority in our villages.</span> <span id="s511">No policeman had any business there.</span> <span id="s512">They gave us freedom of school...of teaching children how we wanted, and they freed us from military service...uh...for generations.</span> <span id="s513">And this...this was...this made us very happy that this was possible.</span> <span id="s514">So the government was very friendly in that way.</span> <span id="s515">And we worked hard.</span> <span id="s516">We started an industry of...uh...wood saw...sawing logs, and this tannery and printing from...We worked together with a speaker, an organization from the United States, which helps third world countries improve cattle...uh...corn, soybeans.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Different things like that.</span> <span id="s518">They came to us, and we had some very good agronomists amongst members, and so they had a station on our land where they experimented to improve peanuts, corn, soybeans, and so on.</span> <span id="s519">So we worked with them, and that also helped us, of course.</span> <span id="s520">In the beginning, the cow...we needed milk for the children.</span> <span id="s521">The cows were all wild cows.</span> <span id="s522">They gave half a cup of milk if you were lucky.</span> <span id="s523">So we needed to improve the dairy, and this took year but it got improved eventually.</span> <span id="s524">For us children, it was actually a nice time.</span> <span id="s525">We never suffered hunger.</span> <span id="s526">We...we didn't get to eat meat, but we had bread.</span> <span id="s527">We had beans.</span> <span id="s528">This is fine.</span> <span id="s529">One doesn't need to live in big luxury to feed comfortable.</span> <span id="s530">We had the school there.</span> <span id="s531">We were cared for.</span> <span id="s532">There was a lot of sickness at first.</span> <span id="s533">Eye diseases....uh...tropical sores, hookworm, malaria.</span> <span id="s534">All these things happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">But...uh...standing together and helping each other and supporting each other made it possible to get over this time.</span> <span id="s536">Now, the...the school was all in...in English I think.</span> <span id="s537">I'm not quite sure.</span> <span id="s538">In Germany, we spoke only German.</span> <span id="s539">In England we switched over from German and English.</span> <span id="s540">In Paraguay, it was German and English and then English I think and Spanish, so I grow up in three languages.</span> <span id="s541">That's why...that's why my spelling to this day is a little wobbly as Pooh Bear would say.</span> <span id="s542">So we had this school there, and we had 9 years of school to the 9th grade, and then I was asked with another boy...another boy from the community, to go to public school, to go to high school but you had to need, you need Spanish for this.</span> <span id="s543">So he and I went to Ascuncion, the capitol, where some other people were studying to be teachers.</span> <span id="s544">Uh...Mainly teachers actually we needed.</span> <span id="s545">We went there to what's called the Kindergrotto, 5th grade, which is the...the last year of the primary school.</span> <span id="s546">In Paraguay, they...I think they use a French system.</span> <span id="s547">Six years primary education, six years high school, and then six or seven years university.</span> <span id="s548">That's how the system works.</span> <span id="s549">So we were quite old,...uh...but we had to do this last year's primary education, kindergrotto.</span> <span id="s550">We didn't know any Spanish hardly, and we had...we had a heck of a time.</span> <span id="s551">(Laughing) Even in the State-run schools, they hardly had any...any...uh...notebooks.</span> <span id="s552">No textbooks, so the teacher dictated.</span> <span id="s553">I remember writing everything down as fast I could.</span> <span id="s554">They speak very fast, and then I went home.</span> <span id="s555">He...my friend and I and asked help of an older man from the community who was studying to be a teacher.</span> <span id="s556">He tried to decipher what we had written down so we could learn it later.</span> <span id="s557">And I stayed in this community in the...the Bruderhof house as we call it for quite a number of years trying to get this education.</span> <span id="s558">This Bruderhof served a number of functions.</span> <span id="s559">In Paraguay you can't just.</span> <span id="s560">.</span> <span id="s561">uh...order something and UPS brings it.</span> <span id="s562">It doesn't work like that.</span> <span id="s563">It doesn't work like that, so all the buying and selling went on in the capitol and then you had to organize transport from the capitol to the colony.</span> <span id="s564">And especially in the beginning years, we had to buy sugar, the soap, the wheat.</span> <span id="s565">Everything had to be bought in the capitol and then transported to the colony.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s567">They're changing tapes.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: So this house which we had in.</span> <span id="s571">.</span> <span id="s572">uh...in Ascunion, the capitol, was a building which we rented and later bought.</span> <span id="s573">And this study was the young people studying, mainly to be teachers or going to secondary school, high school and maybe could be compared to high school.</span> <span id="s574">We also had some people there.</span> <span id="s575">We had a..</span> <span id="s576">.</span> <span id="s577">store, where we sold tanned goods from the...from the community in the country.</span> <span id="s578">And we sold quite of these tanned things out of wood.</span> <span id="s579">Mainly tourists, Americans who came through brought these.</span> <span id="s580">We also made there orange juice, concentrated orange juice and sold it there.</span> <span id="s581">And this capitol also, all the business was transacted.</span> <span id="s582">As I said, sugar, flour, soap, matches, all the things we didn't make ourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Cloth.</span> <span id="s584">All the things we didn't make ourselves had to be bought somehow and then transported up to this colony which we had.</span> <span id="s585">To get from Ascunion to the colony took about 2 days...a day, a night and a day.</span> <span id="s586">One night traveling with a little river boat, maybe...yeah.</span> <span id="s587">.</span> <span id="s588">to and then a day's travel with a horse wagon from the port to the colony...to the community.</span> <span id="s589">While being in.</span> <span id="s590">.</span> <span id="s591">in Ascunion, I remember a time of revolution which happened every now and then and there was wild shooting.</span> <span id="s592">They have...uh...metal telephone on power poles, sheet metal and you could...they were like sieves sometimes at the end of these revolutions.</span> <span id="s593">You know the bullets going right through them.</span> <span id="s594">This all made me...made one remember the times of Germany, England, so this kind of thing went on.</span> <span id="s595">We...I stayed in Ascunion, together with the other people for the whole school year, because things started in January and ended maybe in October and then for the summer holidays I went back to my family in the community in the country.</span> <span id="s596">Another important thing that...that happened to us was since we had three doctors on the pharmacists and the helper on the pharmacy who came with us to Primaware, this community in Paraguay, when the...when the surrounding neighbors found out that we had three doctors, they came flocking because there was not a doctor in a hundred miles circumference.</span> <span id="s597">They had no where to go with their disease and there's plenty of tropical diseases there.</span> <span id="s598">Leprosy, , hookworms.</span> <span id="s599">I tell you it was terrible.</span> <span id="s600">So these people all came for help.</span> <span id="s601">We...we did what we could, but also lacked help.</span> <span id="s602">So very early in the game, then we sent people to North America, brothers and sisters to go to visit big pharmacological places here in the States and beg for medical equipment, medication, money, whatever to start to help these people down there.</span> <span id="s603">And bit by bit we built a hospital.</span> <span id="s604">I think at the highest point it had maybe 30 or 40 beds.</span> <span id="s605">The doctors did all kinds of operations.</span> <span id="s606">Uh...People came when the children were born, hookworm treatment...uh...Saturday night brawls.</span> <span id="s607">All this kind of thing came to the hospital, and we did what we could.</span> <span id="s608">We asked payment insofar as the people could...could pay, but I don't think we ever insisted.</span> <span id="s609">We didn't go to court to demand payment.</span> <span id="s610">That we never did.</span> <span id="s611">Some people paid with eggs or a pig or a cow, but we have to realize that in Paraguay the people living in the country are very poor.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">They don't have any money.</span> <span id="s613">They have very few things.</span> <span id="s614">And so we just helped basically.</span> <span id="s615">We just helped.</span> <span id="s616">But food...sending people to the United States...the people coming here found other people interested in a different way of life where the rat race is cut out.</span> <span id="s617">You know running after money, spending it, having to spend it.</span> <span id="s618">Day and night keeping going ...and this kind of frenzy some people didn't want anymore.</span> <span id="s619">And they were looking for a different way of life altogether.</span> <span id="s620">So when we sent people up there, they met some who were interested and they came to visit us in Paraguay which is very important because we were very isolated in the country, and we never wanted to live for ourselves, for our own edification, for our own salvation.</span> <span id="s621">That is not our purpose.</span> <span id="s622">Our purpose is to show everybody that people can live in peace and justice and harmony together.</span> <span id="s623">That this is possible right now.</span> <span id="s624">And we are...I am not better than anybody else.</span> <span id="s625">I've got the same inclinations, temptations in my heart, but the question is where do I call it...where do I say stop?</span> <span id="s626">And living in community, having this goal of love to each other...a true love which admonishes which helps.</span> <span id="s627">This kind of love is what actually every human being longs for.</span> <span id="s628">And so we did never wanted to live for ourselves.</span> <span id="s629">We wanted...we hoped that we can be a witness to other people that the life and brotherhood is possible.</span> <span id="s630">To Catholics, to Protestants, to Jews, to Moslems, to Agnostics, to Atheists, it doesn't matter.</span> <span id="s631">To bums to rich men.</span> <span id="s632">And so when these people came from North America, they asked many questions.</span> <span id="s633">Why you do this?</span> <span id="s634">Why you this?</span> <span id="s635">And this is good for us.</span> <span id="s636">We need to see what we're doing also through other people eyes and...and see if we are still true to what we want to do.</span> <span id="s637">And so this was good.</span> <span id="s638">In 1954, I think, well we had people then in the States traveling all the time, meeting with interested people.</span> <span id="s639">There was an intentional community movement in the United States in the 50s, and so we visited these people and some wanted to join and some said, "You're too far away in Paraguay.</span> <span id="s640">Why don't you start a community up here?"</span> <span id="s641">So in 1954, we started a community in New York State near...between Kingston and Poughkeepsie.</span> <span id="s642">There's a little town called Roseton, near Newport, and there we bought some land and some houses and started Hutterian Bruderhof where people could come and see if they were ready to join or if they wanted it all, and so this was very good.</span> <span id="s643">(Clearing throat) Now back to Paraguay.</span> <span id="s644">I went to school and then I went to University.</span> <span id="s645">I was training to become a doctor, a medical physician.</span> <span id="s646">And as I said, there were different revolutions going on so when I was in first, second year in medicine, there was a big upheaval in the university and South American altogether and also in Paraguay.</span> <span id="s647">The students are active social movement.</span> <span id="s648">They...the young people protest injustice, the political oppression.</span> <span id="s649">And so the students were always in a..</span> <span id="s650">.</span> <span id="s651">in a revolt, you know, in a stir, in a commotion, asking for justice.</span> <span id="s652">But one day the police came and closed the university down because the government didn't like this social upheaval.</span> <span id="s653">They called it communists.</span> <span id="s654">And...uh...so the closed the university down and the Brother decided that I should go to Montediveo in Uruguay to continue with the studies.</span> <span id="s655">And so I went down there and finished up later on.</span> <span id="s656">And it was in Uruguay, the little community called there called Eldorado, about 10 miles out of Montediveo, where the...where we started another little community.</span> <span id="s657">It started just with a few people working in a dairy farm and then we felt it's better not to be employed, but really start a community so we did that.</span> <span id="s658">We bought, I think, maybe 20, 30 acres with some housing on it.</span> <span id="s659">We sent families down there.</span> <span id="s660">Because we wanted to be near.</span> <span id="s661">.</span> <span id="s662">near a place where people...where we could talk to people and meet people.</span> <span id="s663">We didn't want to live for ourselves.</span> <span id="s664">And also in Ascunion, we didn't find enough places for the young people to be educated in different things, and so this community in Elarado, near Montediveo, Uruguay was supposed to be another center for young people to go to and train.</span> <span id="s665">Maybe I should say at this point that in our community we, the children born into the community are not members.</span> <span id="s666">There's no automatic birthright membership.</span> <span id="s667">The young people they are born there.</span> <span id="s668">They grow up and we try to give them as good education as we can which varies.</span> <span id="s669">In Paraguay it was very limited.</span> <span id="s670">Here in the States, we're very grateful for the education into high school which is free of charge.</span> <span id="s671">But this wasn't so in Paraguay, so...so these children as they grow up, they...they get educated.</span> <span id="s672">They get to know what this community life is all about, but then we're very interested to let them experience how other people live so they can come to a decision seeing both sides of the picture, so to say, and come to a personal decision.</span> <span id="s673">If you want to join in the Bruderhof, it cannot be for.</span> <span id="s674">.</span> <span id="s675">for the parents' sake.</span> <span id="s676">It cannot be for brothers and sisters.</span> <span id="s677">It can't be for a good life which we now have.</span> <span id="s678">We have a good life now.</span> <span id="s679">It can't be for any kind of...uh...comfort.</span> <span id="s680">It can only be for the sake to show the people can live together.</span> <span id="s681">And we found that if we do what Jesus said, it happens.</span> <span id="s682">Now, I want to go back to the time in Germany.</span> <span id="s683">When my father and I and a group of others visited Israel in 1985, we knew that the question of the Holocaust wold come up and there our Jewish friends asked, "What do you think of the Holocaust?"</span> <span id="s684">And my father answered after a moment of silence...I was there.</span> <span id="s685">I heard it.</span> <span id="s686">He said, "The Holocaust is a judgment on the Christians.</span> <span id="s687">Because (clearing throat) all the Germans who did the killing were nominal Christians.</span> <span id="s688">Catholics and Protestants.</span> <span id="s689">And I know that Jesus did not say kill your enemy.</span> <span id="s690">He didn't even say kill the handicapped.</span> <span id="s691">He didn't say kill the imbecile, the mentally handicapped.</span> <span id="s692">He said love your fellowman which is told in the Tennah by God himself.</span> <span id="s693">So this...this love is what we need, and so therefore we said in Israel and kibbutz Hasara in 85, "It is a judgment on the Christians because they did not do what they said they were.”</span> <span id="s694">(Clearing throat) And then my father went on to say, "But if we Christians and you Jews don't take a lesson, don't learn from this Holocaust experience, the Holocaust will come that takes all of us.”</span> <span id="s695">And I think the present day world situation is just about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: Have you been back to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s698">I went back in 88 once.</span> <span id="s699">We had gone again to Israel, invited by the kibbutz movement to visit them.</span> <span id="s700">We stayed there 3 weeks and then back to Germany.</span> <span id="s701">And I remember going to the train station there and I had all these memories coming back from 1937.</span> <span id="s702">(Crying) So I remember that.</span> <span id="s703">We have a little...I hope it doesn't matter if I skip around a bit.</span> <span id="s704">So this was the answer my father gave about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s705">Now for the last few...since l year we have started a community in Germany again in Bernba, near Frankfort, in the .</span> <span id="s706">And we went to this...we went to this village and we bought a property which used to belong to the Catholic CHurch.</span> <span id="s707">It was a children's home.</span> <span id="s708">It was very well suited to community life.</span> <span id="s709">It had plans for three or four more big buildings, community-type buildings.</span> <span id="s710">And so we bought this property and then a resistance developed from the inhabitants of this small village of Bernba, 400 people maybe, which was so...uh...strong against us coming and against us extending that a Lutheran...Angelical minister in Bernba said publicly in a church, "Have we forgotten what happened 50 years ago?</span> <span id="s711">That we are so antagonistic and hateful to people who are not fit into our system?"</span> <span id="s712">She was referring to 1937...uh...to the whole Nazi time where foreigners, Jews...uh...second class citizens were simply hated and exterminated.</span> <span id="s713">She...she said, "Is...are we there again?</span> <span id="s714">Have we not learned?"</span> <span id="s715">There was a real confrontation there and we.</span> <span id="s716">.</span> <span id="s717">we don't know what to do.</span> <span id="s718">We invite the neighbors to come and see and talk.</span> <span id="s719">We sing together, but there is a real little circle there that wants to get us out of Bernba.</span> <span id="s720">This caused an uproar in the newspapers.</span> <span id="s721">Television companies came and made, you know, televisions and...uh...programs which were broadcast all over Germany.</span> <span id="s722">So we think again this attack on us in the end served something good.</span> <span id="s723">People hear about the brotherly way of</span></p> <p><span id="s724">life.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: Is the community still in existence?</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s727">In Germany, we are still holding on.</span> <span id="s728">We don't know how to go, but we're still holding on.</span> <span id="s729">We have no permission to build.</span> <span id="s730">We have no...we can't do a thing because the village authority hasn't given permission yet.</span> <span id="s731">But we hope it will mellow.</span> <span id="s732">We heard that the place we bought in Bernba was a real Nazi center for Nazi, you know, so maybe their spirit is still there.</span> <span id="s733">Personally, I don't think that the Nazi spirit or this hate spirit can be eliminated by killing the people who represent it.</span> <span id="s734">I heard that Cohan was killed...murdered yesterday or two days ago.</span> <span id="s735">And he was...he was very right wing and...and hateful to other people, but I don't think killing him kills the spirit he was serving.</span> <span id="s736">And this is...this is what we think all the time.</span> <span id="s737">And it...on the Bruderhof, I remember that the brotherhood which we called the Committed Members, they wrote letters to Hitler, to Goring, to the Gestapo, to the Nazi officials in Kassel, stating our situation very clearly.</span> <span id="s738">We respect the government.</span> <span id="s739">We are not intending to overcome it with violence, but we can have nothing to do with certain values they uphold.</span> <span id="s740">So we want to love the enemy, but without killing him, without hurting him.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">This is...this is what we aim for.</span> <span id="s742">But this is a struggle for every person.</span> <span id="s743">I..</span> <span id="s744">.</span> <span id="s745">I can be committed to a goal, but it still is harder for me to work towards, because I'm just a humanbeing.</span> <span id="s746">So here I digressed a little.</span> <span id="s747">(Clearing throat) Now, let me think a moment.</span> <span id="s748">So we started a community in the...in North America and we...(clearing throat) in 1960, then we decided to close down all the Paraguayan communities and all come up to the States.</span> <span id="s749">We went through a difficult time in our communities which I maybe can explain best by saying our Hutterian forefathers from the 16th Century compare a community to a lantern, a glass lantern with a candle in the middle like they used to have.</span> <span id="s750">And the community is a lantern, but the important thing in the lantern is the light in the lantern.</span> <span id="s751">The lantern serves only to let the light shine out.</span> <span id="s752">And this light for us is Jesus as love, justice and unity.</span> <span id="s753">That is the light.</span> <span id="s754">And we lost this light.</span> <span id="s755">And...uh.</span> <span id="s756">.</span> <span id="s757">(clearing throat) so the things that destroy community life---self-will, selfishness, egotism, huddling, back biting--all these things that destroy community life came in.</span> <span id="s758">And in 1960, we went through a time where we (clearing throat) everyone was faced with the question what do I want with my life?</span> <span id="s759">Do I want to serve love or do I want to serve myself?</span> <span id="s760">And on this then (clearing throat) a large number left us.</span> <span id="s761">And the rest we came together in North America here, and then we started the community in Connecticut in Norfolk, Connecticut and that's the northwestern corner.</span> <span id="s762">And we were...we bought an old place...it is a castle.</span> <span id="s763">We don't like castles, but this was a place where a hundred people could find lodging right away.</span> <span id="s764">And so we bought this place and 50 acres and in a feel for different groups, we moved up from Paraguay to North America.</span> <span id="s765">Because we needed to...together to find the way to work for the values we had set.</span> <span id="s766">And as humanbeings, we have goals but we always liable to...to move either to the left or to the right and lose the way, but we are determined to find it.</span> <span id="s767">And so that's why we came together in North America again.</span> <span id="s768">While in Uruguay, I met my future wife, Elana.</span> <span id="s769">She was there studying music.</span> <span id="s770">She's part...she's a daughter of the family of the community.</span> <span id="s771">She came down to study music, and we got engaged down there.</span> <span id="s772">And we were engaged for 3 years, because it was in this...this whole time that we closed one community after the other and moved up to the States so there was no time for a marriage.</span> <span id="s773">But when she came up in January 1962...I came up in November 1961...(clearing throat) we decided to marry.</span> <span id="s774">And when I say we, I mean my wife and I and the whole community because all such actions are take...the decisions are made together.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">And so we married in June... 24th of June 1962.</span> <span id="s776">(Clearing Throat) We had a..</span> <span id="s777">.</span> <span id="s778">it was a wonderful occasion.</span> <span id="s779">Then we had two children in Connecticut and then we were asked to move to our community in Pennsylvania which had also started.</span> <span id="s780">Maybe I should say here that (clearing throat) when we decide free willing...when I decide free willingly to become a member of this community, I declare my readiness to serve wherever it's needed.</span> <span id="s781">So I can work in the shop making toys for children.</span> <span id="s782">I could clean bathrooms.</span> <span id="s783">I could work in the dining room.</span> <span id="s784">Where...wherever I'm needed.</span> <span id="s785">I don't want to fulfill my gifts specially.</span> <span id="s786">I'm here to serve.</span> <span id="s787">And so in this sense my family moved to the Pennsylvania community, and I worked there in the shop.</span> <span id="s788">I worked in the school.</span> <span id="s789">And then in 1972, we moved again to the Connecticut community 1973 to be with my father, my mother, and the parents of my wife.</span> <span id="s790">They were getting older.</span> <span id="s791">My father-in-law, and so we...we came together to support them as children in this time.</span> <span id="s792">So now, what else?</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: I guess if that's the end of it, that's the end of this tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">A: I think that's the end of the story.</span> <span id="s795">I would like to say that we are very eager to meet people from all kinds of backgrounds, to talk, to exchange and...and to see if maybe they also free willingly would like to join with us to give this witness of brotherhood.</span> <span id="s796">That is the purpose.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A: Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Conclusion of Interview</span></p></body></html>
