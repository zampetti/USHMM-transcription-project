Okay, one thing that I wanted to ask you about Mr. Willner, is that in the first interview that the Holocaust Museum did with you, there -- we didn’t discuss your -- your childhood at all, before Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s13">And I wondered if you would say something about your -- your father, and your mother, and your -- your school experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Answer: Okay, I said before, I was born in Munchinglapba, which is in the Rhineland, near Cologne, between Cologne and Dusseldorf.</span> <span id="s15">And I am a fairly good rec -- recol -- recollection.</span> <span id="s16">My mother already is born in that city, and my father was born about 20 miles from there.</span> <span id="s17">And my father got to know my mother because of World War One.</span> <span id="s18">He was in the German army, in the front line, and just like today when we have a war, on -- World War Two, families send packages to their sons, who are soldiers, or -- or communities do that to the sons of the community who are fighting wars.</span> <span id="s19">And so in my father’s case, he received, while he was in Russia, so-called care packages, and -- from the Winter family.</span> <span id="s20">We had a Willners, and the Winter family had two daughters and one son.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: The Winter family is your mother’s family?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: My mother’s family.</span> <span id="s23">And so when the war was over, my father went to this home, and -- to thank her for the two years of cookies, or baked stuff they sent him to Russia.</span> <span id="s24">And then they both -- the girl that sent these to him, my aunt, and my mother were not married, but -- and he -- my father, of course, is not, and he was looking around to see if he could find a wife, or something.</span> <span id="s25">And he did not get interested in the girl that send him the cookies, baked the cookies, but in her sister, younger sister, which became -- who became my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: What was your mother’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: My mother’s name was Augusta Willner -- or Winter, as -- here.</span> <span id="s28">And they got married in 1924, and two years later I arrived.</span> <span id="s29">The period in Germany, in that time, was bad, just like in the United States.</span> <span id="s30">We had the collapse of the stock market, [indecipherable] by World War One, and there were many people without jobs, and many upheavals.</span> <span id="s31">Communists and others.</span> <span id="s32">And so I -- I assumed that they knew each other since the end of the war, since that’s when he went there first, but they got married 1924.</span> <span id="s33">And so six years later, and I arrived another two years later, I was the only child of -- and I also think I know is shu -- that’s reason my parents had only one child, because the situation -- the economic situation in Germany was very bad, complete collapse.</span> <span id="s34">And my father did have a job, and so we -- apparently, they had no problems, but they decided just to have one child.</span> <span id="s35">And then Hitler came on the scene, and then su-sure enough, a lot of Jews didn’t have a -- had less children, and in my father’s case, he lived, like I said, 20 miles from where I was born, and his father lived in that same house in the country, til 1941, and he was -- then they took him out of his house, they took the house away from him, and sold it, the Nazi party, and they gave it to a Nazi, was -- and -- and so in -- in that house were all the belongings of the Willner family, which were demolished on the Crystal night.</span> <span id="s36">And I have to tell a story about my father, because it was different in many cases, in this case, it was -- it turned out pretty good.</span> <span id="s37">When my -- when Crystal night happened, they burned the synagogues, and they demolished Jewish homes, stores, and wrote Jew on buildings belonging to Jews.</span> <span id="s38">My fa-father went -- left the -- he knew there was something going on against the Jews, and he went to look after his father, lived by himself, almost 80 years old, and -- but pretty fit, but he want to see then he’s okay, so he l -- went there, and when he came to the house -- like I tell you, is a small community in the country, maybe about 500 people living there.</span> <span id="s39">And he had a tha -- I think the house must have been built just before World War One.</span> <span id="s40">[indecipherable] and he walked in, and he knew that something going on inside.</span> <span id="s41">As he walked in, he saw Na-Nazis in -- in uniform, the Brown shirts, smashing everything in the place.</span> <span id="s42">My grandfather standing by and, watching, not saying anything.</span> <span id="s43">So my father walked in, he knew that he -- he shouldn’t have come, maybe, except for his father.</span> <span id="s44">And the chief of police of the little town of Klaifaht was there.</span> <span id="s45">The chief of police was not a Nazi, he was in uniform, police uniform.</span> <span id="s46">And my father walked in, he says, “Siegfried,” which was his name, “what are you doing here?”</span> <span id="s47">The connection between him and the chief of police was that when they were little children, or boys, they sat together on a -- on a school bench for several years.</span> <span id="s48">And they knew each other very -- very well.</span> <span id="s49">So he couldn’t, in front of other people, Germans, say, “Disappear, get out of here -- here.”</span> <span id="s50">He said, “Well, I don’t know why you came here.”</span> <span id="s51">He said, “Well [indecipherable] look after my father.”</span> <span id="s52">“Well,” he said, “[indecipherable] I’m looking after your father, nothing happens to him.</span> <span id="s53">But see, I cannot stop these guys, too, what they’re doing.”</span> <span id="s54">They came from another city.</span> <span id="s55">They always sent in German, they didn’t use the same people from the same city, always from the next city, or so.</span> <span id="s56">And he -- “I cannot prevent any smashing of materials, but I will see to it that fath -- your father isn’t hurt.</span> <span id="s57">And by the way,” he said, “you know your brother is in prison here.”</span> <span id="s58">“I know.”</span> <span id="s59">This was the son, the younger brother, who was li-living in the house with ma -- my grandfather, but had moved out [indecipherable] he got married.</span> <span id="s60">He was married to a Christian woman, whose brothers were Nazis, and asked her to divorce him under the Nuremberg laws.</span> <span id="s61">And she refused.</span> <span id="s62">She said that in the good days she was with him, he’s -- in the bad days were -- make a long story short, they went to -- with the help of a Catholic organization to Holland, which was, at that time, this was in -- this was in 1938 -- 30 -- ’39, beginning of ’39.</span> <span id="s63">They went to a place in Holland, like a camp, but a Catholic organization was taking care of them, too.</span> <span id="s64">Moved them maybe to Brazil, or someplace in South America.</span> <span id="s65">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: Will you tell me where you were during Kristallnacht, and what happened to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: I was at home, and nothing happened to me.</span> <span id="s68">I -- nobody came to our house.</span> <span id="s69">I went to my school, I had to leave German school, because Jewish children could not be in the classroom with the German children.</span> <span id="s70">And so I went to then, the new school, Jewish school, one they installed in the back room of a synagogue, which was a Conservative synagogue.</span> <span id="s71">And then I wanted to go to school, and see what happens, and somebody said, “Your s -- your school is burning.”</span> <span id="s72">Well, it was synagogue that was burnt, but the school was in the synagogue.</span> <span id="s73">I wanted to take a look.</span> <span id="s74">Nobody bother me, some um -- most people, I mean, didn’t know I was Jewish, you know.</span> <span id="s75">And the incident there was interesting.</span> <span id="s76">The Nazis put the thing -- this is a -- a [indecipherable] fire.</span> <span id="s77">And the -- the fire department showed up to put out the fire.</span> <span id="s78">And the -- not what the Nazis wanted, they wanted us to burn down, but they endangered, in many cases, the houses next to them, which were not Jewish houses.</span> <span id="s79">But -- and people protested, and so the fire department standing by, in our case, had the water ready, and -- in case the flames would go out to the side, to the other houses.</span> <span id="s80">And the police came, or was already there, in [indecipherable] and they said, “We want you to stop the burning, you endanger other people’s lives.”</span> <span id="s81">And they said no, they going to burn down to the ground.</span> <span id="s82">So a policeman trying to stop them, but they -- they couldn’t, and the one policeman then went to a fire hose, which wa -- were -- were -- that were not in use, because they -- they want to burn down, not put the fire -- and they only had them down for protection on the other homes.</span> <span id="s83">So policeman took the hose, and started directing towards the synagogue.</span> <span id="s84">And one of the Nazis, the Brown shirt came by, and with a dagger, cut the hose, so there wouldn’t be no water coming out, they quit.</span> <span id="s85">So that was my knowledge of the hol -- Crystal night.</span> <span id="s86">I didn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: Did you see that happening from where you were?</span> <span id="s88">A: I heard the discussion.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: I -- later on they told me what -- people that I knew, what happened, they were ta -- all talking about there were conflict with the police and the Brown shirt.</span> <span id="s91">Yes, I -- I did -- I didn’t see the actual cutting, but I saw the argument between the SA and the police.</span> <span id="s92">And the police was pretty decent, our town.</span> <span id="s93">I have other example on that.</span> <span id="s94">And so they told me to go home, which I did.</span> <span id="s95">And I passed several Jewish homes, and they were all the windows smashed in, the furniture on the sidewalk, nothing ta -- I didn’t see anybody get hurt or anything, but some people did get hurt, but in general, in our town, nobody got hurt.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: Were you -- were you home with your mother that night?</span> <span id="s97">Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: And my father, like I said, he -- he left early in the morning to look after his father.</span> <span id="s99">So we didn’t know any -- was -- this was all about, and we could -- we could guess what this all about, but we didn’t expect that.</span> <span id="s100">My father told us to stay home, just stay where we are.</span> <span id="s101">My grandparents were, on my mother’s side, were also in the same town, about half a mile away.</span> <span id="s102">Nothing happened to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: Was your family religious at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: Not my parents.</span> <span id="s105">My grandparents were.</span> <span id="s106">Not Orthodox, they were -- they had kosher at home, but they didn’t go to synagogue every [indecipherable] Saturday morning or Friday night.</span> <span id="s107">And my grandfather looked like a real Germanic type.</span> <span id="s108">He was blonde, had -- the hair he had left, had a big moustache, and he looked like a German peasant, maybe.</span> <span id="s109">And so he had a lot of friends who were not Jewish, and we had no -- no -- none in particular [indecipherable] my family.</span> <span id="s110">There were other families who got beaten up, many of them.</span> <span id="s111">Some of them because they [indecipherable] alone and they was enable, took advantage of it, beat up a Jew, or smash his window.</span> <span id="s112">And in our place, the -- like I said, the police was pretty good.</span> <span id="s113">My uncle, my mother’s brother, Neil, had been arrested Crystal night, and sent to Dachau concentration camp.</span> <span id="s114">He was also a decorated war veteran, he had the Iron Cross.</span> <span id="s115">He had -- he brought home from the war, his saber, which he was allowed to, because of his rank, and he had the Iron Cross.</span> <span id="s116">So before i -- Cr-Crystal night, two policemen came to the -- to my grandparents home where he lived, he was not married, and they said, “We have orders to pick up your saber, and your medals.”</span> <span id="s117">He questioned that.</span> <span id="s118">He said, “We are police, we are not Nazi party members.</span> <span id="s119">We have an order we have to carry out.”</span> <span id="s120">Ma -- they were excusing the action.</span> <span id="s121">They didn’t even want to do it, but they -- policemen had to do it.</span> <span id="s122">So my uncle said, “Okay.”</span> <span id="s123">He had a medal, he took the medals, threw them on the floor, and, “You can also have the saber.”</span> <span id="s124">And he threw the saber and broke the -- the blade.</span> <span id="s125">And he threw that on the floor to them.</span> <span id="s126">And they were very apologetic about it, and, “We’re just carrying out orders.</span> <span id="s127">We are sorry.</span> <span id="s128">It’s not our doing, but is our order.”</span> <span id="s129">And they took -- and they took my great-grandfather, whom I also knew.</span> <span id="s130">He got to be 96.</span> <span id="s131">He was also in the house, and he used to be a public school teacher, and he had received for his work what they call the Hohnsellon medal.</span> <span id="s132">Hohnsellon was the German Kaiser, of the Hohnsellon family.</span> <span id="s133">And he gave awards, and medals out to people who are deserving, who did something for the state, or for the country.</span> <span id="s134">And he had that framed on the wall, the medal and certificate.</span> <span id="s135">And they said, “By the way, we have to take that, too.”</span> <span id="s136">My uncle [indecipherable] military, but every Jew -- Jews don’t have the right to have medals any more.</span> <span id="s137">So, he took -- they took that, too.</span> <span id="s138">But they did no harm.</span> <span id="s139">So, to continue the story for my father.</span> <span id="s140">The police just took him back to the police building, and the jail was attached to it, it was just a couple of cells.</span> <span id="s141">And the police chief said to my father, “Want to see your brother?”</span> <span id="s142">And they opened the door, and there are five Jews in there, men, his brother included.</span> <span id="s143">And they had a -- they were playing cards.</span> <span id="s144">They had food in there, and they were -- you know what, they were being nice to bi -- and he said -- he was [indecipherable], “Say good-bye to your brother, because frankly I don’t know when you’re going to see him again,” this police chief said.</span> <span id="s145">Well, they didn’t think about Dachau, but that’s where he went, Dachau.</span> <span id="s146">And if my father would have been [indecipherable] he would have gone, too.</span> <span id="s147">But, he -- the chief said, “I don’t have an arrest warrant for you here.</span> <span id="s148">They probably have a [indecipherable] your hometown.</span> <span id="s149">So I have to make a call.”</span> <span id="s150">And he called the chief in Mitchiglumba, and he said, “I have a,” -- I think he said old friend of mine, apparently [indecipherable] and he didn’t say, I have a Jew here by the name of Willner, and he an old friend of mine.</span> <span id="s151">“I don’t have an arrest warrant wi -- but he lives in your city.</span> <span id="s152">Would you check, please?”</span> <span id="s153">He said, “Yes, he’s on the list to be arrested.”</span> <span id="s154">So the guy that was my father’s friend, he, “Okay, I’ll send him back to you.”</span> <span id="s155">Hung up the phone, and of course my father listened to all of this.</span> <span id="s156">And the chief said, “I’ll tell you what Siegfried.</span> <span id="s157">The next bus is at 11 o’clock, you will be on it, back to your home, and then you will report to the police, which is what we agree [indecipherable] here.”</span> <span id="s158">And he did like this -- your problem.</span> <span id="s159">So the other policeman knew, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: He winked, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: He winked at my father.</span> <span id="s162">And to make a long story short, the next bus, 11 o’clock, my father thought he was being sent back out with a police escort to -- the chief said, “Get on the bus.</span> <span id="s163">Report to the chief when you get there.”</span> <span id="s164">No police escort, or -- and my father, of course, didn’t report to the police.</span> <span id="s165">He -- he went home first and said, “I’m not going to stay here, they going to start looking for me,” and he [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: I’m going to interrupt you because I don’t want to repeat all the stories that you’ve already told in the video interview.</span> <span id="s167">So, I wanted to just move on to the time of your liberation.</span> <span id="s168">And -- and you described in your videotaped interview about that, about how that came about, and how you had been with your friends Mike Swab, and how you had been following the -- the sounds of the -- of the artillery fire, and -- and eventually became kind of caught up in a battle, and went over to the American side.</span> <span id="s169">Can you describe in some detail how -- how once you got over, and were -- and were joined with the American army, what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: Okay, we es -- we escaped, of course, from a transport of Langenstein concentration camp, to -- we were going east.</span> <span id="s171">That I knew.</span> <span id="s172">I knew a couple [indecipherable] from a map I had seen.</span> <span id="s173">I didn’t have any maps.</span> <span id="s174">And Langenstein concentration camp was one that was going to be a temporary camp for the building of tunnels, to produce the wheat to underground, because the factories were all bombed out by the ally.</span> <span id="s175">And Michael Swab, that’s one of my best friends, and I describe Michael, how I met him in a camp.</span> <span id="s176">His father was killed, and his brother-in-law.</span> <span id="s177">They were frozen to death.</span> <span id="s178">They came back from work and they had been told they did not perform properly, they were sabotaging German wer -- wer -- for these 150 germ -- 150 Dutch Jews, who had arrived at this small camp, which was about 600 people, to repair railr -- railroads, and then -- so Mike’s fa-father and brother came back from work one day, and they were accused not having worked properly, and they s -- wanted to make example of them.</span> <span id="s179">They stood these people up in the middle of the winter, which is pretty bad in Poland, not like here, and they took a fire hose, and hosed them down with cold water.</span> <span id="s180">Ordered them to stand, they couldn’t rub themselves dry and warm, it was ice cold water.</span> <span id="s181">And to make a long story [indecipherable] by next morning they were -- most of them, they were dead.</span> <span id="s182">Mike’s father and brother-in-law, Morron.</span> <span id="s183">That’s where we came -- there were f -- I spoke Dutch, that was the other thing.</span> <span id="s184">I think I explained before why I -- how I came to speak Dutch, I picked up a Dutch -- [indecipherable] Dutch was very inposit.</span> <span id="s185">So, when we emptied the camp, they had a new method, I thought.</span> <span id="s186">In the previous Death March, that we had from Bleshammer to Roshosen, we marched everybody together, 4,000 some people that marched out.</span> <span id="s187">But there were other people came in from other camps, smaller camps, so the -- Swallhallingpoint, which was our camp.</span> <span id="s188">And so, there were actually more than 4,000, I didn’t know that til after the war.</span> <span id="s189">All through my friend, Mizza Kraning.</span> <span id="s190">And they decided, when we walked out of Langenstein, to walk out in groups of 500, which was for better control, in case some people may escape.</span> <span id="s191">And there are 4,000 people coming, and -- which was good for us, too.</span> <span id="s192">Not every group had a police dog, German Shepherd, or had a lot of guards.</span> <span id="s193">Some of the guards were ol-older guys, older SS men, and they knew the war was finished, they lost.</span> <span id="s194">And so -- but, we didn’t walk -- want to walk out, Mike and I, and we hid for awhile, and then we saw the Germans put up machine guns.</span> <span id="s195">I figured they’re going to execute everybody in front of the camp.</span> <span id="s196">Well, they made a last appeal over the PA system, they said, “This is the last call, everybody get out of the back who is left, who is hiding.</span> <span id="s197">If you don’t be marched out, you will -- you know what’s going to happen.”</span> <span id="s198">So Michael and I decided we got up -- not disappear, but in the final stand, sh-shoot out on the spot.</span> <span id="s199">We stayed there through some cases.</span> <span id="s200">We went to -- or came out of hiding, and there was a double wall in one of the barracks, and we were loit the last group walking out, and we lucky we did, because I have pictures from the v-video from the National Archives, that was taken on the camp, we were in the middle, where the barracks were, the -- how do you call his?</span> <span id="s201">The appelleplatz in German, which was the -- just like soldiers have to be on the --</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: For -- for roll call?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: Yeah, for roll call.</span> <span id="s204">The last roll call, they said otherwise they -- they get shot.</span> <span id="s205">So Michael and I decided we’re going, that well escape from outside of [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s206">All that has been ah -- always our friend.</span> <span id="s207">So we wen -- walked out with the la -- a last group of 500, or so.</span> <span id="s208">And we decided that we must escape.</span> <span id="s209">Oh yeah, we joined in the group, four other young fellows who were mostly Dutch, there was one other guy there, who we had confidence in, we knew each other.</span> <span id="s210">Mike knew them better than I did.</span> <span id="s211">And they accepted me, and we -- we had decided that we will, during the night, escape into three different direction, two each.</span> <span id="s212">We did two each, because that’s always better than being alone, for one thing, give you more encouragement.</span> <span id="s213">And then also, when we escaped, six, two in each direction, one back, and one forward, or one to the side, or whatever, that when they start firing, it is much harder for them to get all of them, if they all bunched together, running away.</span> <span id="s214">And that we would have a chance to come out alive, that somebody’s is get -- going to get shot, and somebody may be lucky.</span> <span id="s215">And the -- Mike Swab and I were the lucky ones.</span> <span id="s216">We -- there were shots fired at us, but maybe by one or two guys in the group.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: What happened to the other four?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: I don’t know, frankly.</span> <span id="s219">They went in another direction.</span> <span id="s220">I assume, I cannot say, that they were killed.</span> <span id="s221">They fired enough shots.</span> <span id="s222">And one thing I didn’t mention, we escape, we had the -- the -- the situation had to be proper -- prop -- had to be in such a way that they couldn’t follow us where -- where we were, didn’t have the -- the personnel to do this.</span> <span id="s223">We had just crossed a small bridge, and we knew that police dogs pick up the smell of an escaping prisoner, or somebody else, particularly us, we smelt to high heaven.</span> <span id="s224">We were full of lice, we -- w-we’re walking skeleton.</span> <span id="s225">By then I’m wa -- when I was weighed -- weighted by American, 75 pounds when I was 18 years old.</span> <span id="s226">But we were healthy -- and Mike’s about the same.</span> <span id="s227">So okay, we decided we do this when -- I think the word is pospicious.</span> <span id="s228">When the time is proper to leave.</span> <span id="s229">And the big thing that helped us was it was a pretty dark night.</span> <span id="s230">They could not put on lights, the SS, to see who is running, or ma -- because there were airplanes are overhead, Americans.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: -- we had talked about this many times befo -- before our escape.</span> <span id="s233">We thought it would be good to escape the dog or dogs, if we swam through a river, because they couldn’t pick up the smell in the water.</span> <span id="s234">And -- or, in case there was no water, they would go after the prisoner, then bite them, go for their throat.</span> <span id="s235">And then by their barking, attract the guards, help them finish the job.</span> <span id="s236">So, when we crossed the bridge, for awhile, our luck was on our side.</span> <span id="s237">We knew where the river was, we could just cross the bridge, but -- and there were planes overhead, so we knew they couldn’t put any searchlights on.</span> <span id="s238">And we were told -- we were marching ranks of four, two to one side, and two to the other side sumweech.</span> <span id="s239">And the SS were -- they went a little bit further out, and we got -- then they’re going to hit just as much as we would if they stayed there.</span> <span id="s240">And so here we were across the bridge, and we said, “Now.”</span> <span id="s241">We all took off, and Mike and I, we l -- took off for the river, because we didn’t know they were planning before, who was going to be on the river side, who was going to be other way.</span> <span id="s242">Michael and I [indecipherable] and running the other way, but running the river way.</span> <span id="s243">And we also didn’t know who could swim.</span> <span id="s244">Well, we talked about it, and some guys were too weak to swim.</span> <span id="s245">And Mike and I could swim, which was no problem.</span> <span id="s246">And the river was a tiny little thing, but enough to get the dog off our back.</span> <span id="s247">And not dogs, and -- one dog.</span> <span id="s248">So we got into the water, which was of course, ice cold, and the dog got Mike in the leg, but we -- we want to strangle the dog.</span> <span id="s249">We decided the dog is not as -- he’s ferocious, but makes a lot of noise, and their dogs -- we have here the police department, who will also attack somebody, but not for the throat, like these dogs were trained for us.</span> <span id="s250">And well, to make a long story short, it wasn’t [indecipherable] the guy called off -- the guy in charge of -- I guess a group of 500, there were two whistle blows, and I think that meant recall, I don’t know, I think it meant recall, because the dog immediately left us, and also ran back.</span> <span id="s251">We thought we were going to kill the dog and -- and -- because I know from doing this after the Holocaust, a dog that attacks you, even German Shepherd, and you get to the throat, and you get -- cut him off his air, he cannot -- he may be able to bite you, but he’ll tear into you everywhere, and that’s what we had thought we would have to do, but he was recall, and we went through the water on the other side.</span> <span id="s252">And then made a U-turn, sort of through the back [indecipherable] you fear somebody’s going to come across the bridge, and we don’t want to be here.</span> <span id="s253">And could hear at night better.</span> <span id="s254">Also if maybe they made a U-turn, too, and we meet head to head.</span> <span id="s255">So where to prevent all that?</span> <span id="s256">Well, we draw a split second decision, and well, we went and we saw a couple of f-farms -- farmhouses.</span> <span id="s257">I said, “We got to get into one of those farmhouses, not wake up the inhabitants, and” --</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: Hold on one second.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: -- so we hid in a potato cellar of the house, which was which was -- faces to the outside, and we s -- ate raw potatoes, and we left the house again because didn’t -- we didn’t want to be discovered by the farmer.</span> <span id="s260">So we only travel at -- at night, in the daytime we hid in bushes, to watch the sound of the artillery, we hear sounds of the arti -- it was coming from, we figure out, the front line.</span> <span id="s261">And it was towards the west.</span> <span id="s262">There, I [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s263">So, but we got a little bit confused, we didn’t know, we didn’t care where we were, as long as we stayed away from these -- so we hit one more time, and near t -- near a village, outside, and we heard tanks rumbling.</span> <span id="s264">We were -- it must be the Americans.</span> <span id="s265">We didn’t see one German tank in there.</span> <span id="s266">We saw soldiers far away.</span> <span id="s267">And we said we have to do everything to get as fast as we can towards them.</span> <span id="s268">So when we -- one morning, in the early morning, there were German old guys, and young guys, what they call the li -- not li [indecipherable] volksdune, which were the guys that they got back in the service, too old to be a soldier the front, or too young.</span> <span id="s269">And they were lay -- laying -- lying in holes, real -- two guys per hole, or under vilv.</span> <span id="s270">We were afraid the American tanks were coming through, like as if they were not the regular soldiers, but they were called up again to serve.</span> <span id="s271">Well, how do we get past these guys, dincorner?</span> <span id="s272">Like I said, it was very dark in there.</span> <span id="s273">And we listened first, and we figure out there’s one hole there, and one hole further, but enough in the middle to crawl through.</span> <span id="s274">They can fire at us, but it looks as don’t come out [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s275">Didn’t know the enemy’s right across the field.</span> <span id="s276">And they wouldn’t fire a bazooka or a det at the German weapon against tanks, which we call a bazooka.</span> <span id="s277">And -- so I said -- we s -- we decide to crawl [indecipherable], and the -- all of a sudden it got light -- oh no, be-before you -- you got through, this German called on us, and we gave the password, and he called loud enough so you could -- everybody could hear, there was -- it was quiet for awhile.</span> <span id="s278">There was nobody firing, it was a wait.</span> <span id="s279">And -- and he i -- asked for the password, and of course, didn’t have the pas -- I said, “Hell mund.”</span> <span id="s280">Shut up, I said.</span> <span id="s281">This -- the German army patrol, they call it the patrol.</span> <span id="s282">My German was good, you know, and I had heard command given before.</span> <span id="s283">Michael [indecipherable] me [inaudible] he spoke [indecipherable] German, but not that good.</span> <span id="s284">So I made up something, I said, “Shut up,” to the German reconnaissance patrol.</span> <span id="s285">And he said, “But the password.”</span> <span id="s286">I -- I -- this was all calling, ontaw, I didn’t even see the guy, I knew he was in [inaudible] and I said, “We are from the -- I said some,” -- I -- I -- I mentioned Germany.</span> <span id="s287">I don’t remember what I said, I made up a unit, and then -- so I apparently didn’t get the password, but we’re here for the same thing, we want to find out who is front of us.</span> <span id="s288">And we kept crawling, we just didn’t bother, and he didn’t say anything.</span> <span id="s289">So, all of a sudden, it was like these guys were behind us, and we saw tanks, maybe five time as far as the tree on the other side of the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: Okay, so the tree is probably about 30 feet away?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: So maybe 80 feet?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: So before that moved up in the night, and sit still.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: Because they were going to move early in the morning, and -- which they did, when it was light, and they had been ordered to move up, relieve another unit, and there was 16 or 17 tanks.</span> <span id="s296">One company, a thir -- a third armored division.</span> <span id="s297">32nd armored regiment.</span> <span id="s298">And when we saw the first American tank switch on the mo -- the engine, they started to move, Mike and I came out with our hands up.</span> <span id="s299">We were the only people around that they could see.</span> <span id="s300">And the moment we did that, they all stopped, and waited for the command of the commanding officer, what they should do.</span> <span id="s301">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s302">Well, a couple of guys jumped off the tanks, and we showed the number on our arm, and they looked at us, we’re full of lice, skeleton, he said, “Okay.”</span> <span id="s303">He jump on the tank.</span> <span id="s304">He as -- he said, “We’re going to take you along.</span> <span id="s305">[indecipherable] this village fine.”</span> <span id="s306">Okay.</span> <span id="s307">“Where are the guys with the panzerfow, or the bazooka?”</span> <span id="s308">We said, “There are two holes hide behind that, because we sneaked right through the middle.”</span> <span id="s309">So a German -- a American who spoke German more or less fluently, a sergeant came up, and he had a public address system, was [indecipherable] thing.</span> <span id="s310">He said -- he said, “We know where you are, that you’ve been ordered to defend the village, but we just found out from two,” -- he didn’t say [indecipherable] we came, “who have just come through there, who knows where your positions are.</span> <span id="s311">We give you five minutes.</span> <span id="s312">Come out with a white flag, or we going to blast your village to pieces.”</span> <span id="s313">And they gave them five minutes, and the tanks started forward, and the Germans came out with their hands up, a couple dozen all along the village.</span> <span id="s314">And that was about all.</span> <span id="s315">They took them prisoner, but I don’t think th -- at least we didn’t keep them.</span> <span id="s316">They were turned over to some other Americans, who came by, who were supposed to take them to a pr -- a [indecipherable] or something.</span> <span id="s317">I guess -- they’re all old guys, and young kids, six -- 15 - 16.</span> <span id="s318">And then so, we identified us, and then we come -- the commander came, first lieutenant, and Lieutenant Hovlent is still alive today, a very nice, religious man, who gave permission then to -- that we stay with them, that we didn’t know where to go, and maybe show them where some other prisoners would be hidden, or liberated.</span> <span id="s319">That’s why they sent the radio out, and also they were giving wh -- well, I told them that the camp is probably about so many miles from here, within a radius, if they should dispatch a column in their camp.</span> <span id="s320">And it had now -- another unit already got there and found the camp.</span> <span id="s321">Okay, so they went to the next village, and it was night -- evening, [indecipherable] to stay here, I -- that’s where we going to stay.</span> <span id="s322">We thought they were going [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s323">“You stay with us, you will sleep like us, you throw some Germans out of their homes, and they can go and find some friends, sleep with them.</span> <span id="s324">But we want a good, nice, warm place.</span> <span id="s325">And you can go with us.”</span> <span id="s326">And Lieutenant Hovlent, and his executive officer, who unfortunately, died recently -- because he knew more about -- I coming to another story later on, than Lieutenant Hovlent.</span> <span id="s327">He -- he set up to a kitchen [indecipherable], about 150 soldiers, in a company with 70 tank, and, “You stay with the kitchen.</span> <span id="s328">When they sleep, you want to eat.”</span> <span id="s329">Had to come to the kitchen to eat, but the kitchen [indecipherable] there.</span> <span id="s330">So [indecipherable], and he made announcement that these three young boys, [indecipherable] the kitchen, they can go in any time they -- they want to, and eat.</span> <span id="s331">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: Did you speak any English?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s334">Mike also, though not -- not very well, but like I said, one sergeant spoke German, and there was a Jewish soldier, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: Do you remember what you talked about with some of these young American soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: That we came from a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s337">They didn’t know about the camp, but they [indecipherable] when they heard from other guys, and I guess in their u -- papers, the journal they kept, yeah, the military journal the commanding officer keeps, what they did today, what they did yesterday, how much ammunition they have left, how many guys went sick, and [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s338">So we were -- spoke enough English to [inaudible], and Lieutenant Hovlent never spoke very much, he still doesn’t.</span> <span id="s339">He was a very religious guy.</span> <span id="s340">Toward the fraternization phase, when the war was over, six months later, that peace was signed.</span> <span id="s341">A lot of American, there was a -- not the law, but a rule, not to fraternize with the German, and it was more or less an -- an order, not to go out with German girls, because [indecipherable] available.</span> <span id="s342">And they wanted food, which the soldiers gave them, and they got sex in return.</span> <span id="s343">But some of them -- many of the soldiers did, but Lieutenant Hovlent never talked to a German, never touched a girl.</span> <span id="s344">And there was one more guy with them, Hansen, who was of German descent, parents spoke German at home.</span> <span id="s345">He knew fluent German.</span> <span id="s346">He was in the kitchen with us.</span> <span id="s347">He slept with us.</span> <span id="s348">And I said one day to him, “Nick, you told me you have German descent, your parents spoke German at home, do you speak German?”</span> <span id="s349">He ne -- he said, “Yes, fluently.”</span> <span id="s350">“And then why don’t you speak with some of them?</span> <span id="s351">Why do you make it difficult?”</span> <span id="s352">He said, “After what I -- you boys told me, I’m not proud to be of German descent, and I decided I’m not going to speak any German.”</span> <span id="s353">And he kept his word, he never spoke [indecipherable] he lives in New Jersey, Nick Hansen, and like I said Lieutenant Hovlent was a very religious guy.</span> <span id="s354">He lives in Minnesota today.</span> <span id="s355">He has other children.</span> <span id="s356">His wife, unfortunately, has Parkinson’s, too, so we have another thing in common.</span> <span id="s357">But I lost Lieutenant Hovlent’s contact one time when he moved, and for years I didn’t talk to him, or call him couple times a year.</span> <span id="s358">But my wife went on the computer one day, and through research, she found him.</span> <span id="s359">And this was a couple of years ago.</span> <span id="s360">And I call him up again, and since that time we’re calling each other once a month.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: Were you given any work to do with the kitchen crew?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: No.</span> <span id="s363">Our work consisted of just watching them prepare the food and eat.</span> <span id="s364">And I picked up 50 pounds in three months, which was actually a danger, because a lot of prisoners died from overeating, and also, I forgot to mention, one of the requirements to stay with them was that we go to the battalion surgeon, to the doctor [indecipherable] and get ourse -- self examined, see that we don’t carry any infectious diseases, the protection of [indecipherable] soldier.</span> <span id="s365">And well, we got examined by a doctor, and he decided we don’t have any infectious diseases.</span> <span id="s366">We are full -- we are full of lice, we have to get rid of them immediately, so nobody else -- and about food he didn’t say, he said they got to be -- be fattened a little bit.</span> <span id="s367">He -- he -- th-they -- they weighed us, and that’s why I knew five -- 75 pounds.</span> <span id="s368">And they knew that we were just skeletons, but healthy.</span> <span id="s369">So, we stayed with the kitchen crew, and then they got orders to move onto another village, another va -- and the same thing happened again, they soja -- oh yeah, I forgot.</span> <span id="s370">The first thing they did after they came from the doctor is two soldiers [indecipherable] escort a -- to a rel -- to a German house.</span> <span id="s371">The woman’s husband was fighting somewhere in Russia, and she was there with one child.</span> <span id="s372">And he said, “Well, we putting these two boys in your house, and -- where’s your husband?”</span> <span id="s373">She said, “In Russia.</span> <span id="s374">Maybe he’s dead,” she said.</span> <span id="s375">“Well,” he said, “how big was your husband, how tall?”</span> <span id="s376">“Small, like I am.”</span> <span id="s377">“Well,” he said, “these two men here are small, too.</span> <span id="s378">Show them the clothes that you had for your husband.”</span> <span id="s379">Went into closet, and take -- pick out some clothes, and he -- they said, “You going to stay temporarily in this house, til you’ve been deloused, you got some clothing and pick out what you want.</span> <span id="s380">And then when you finish bathing, we want to come for scout, we going to go leave you now here, and we come back with a medical team.”</span> <span id="s381">[indecipherable] And the woman cried, and cried.</span> <span id="s382">We weren’t -- we weren’t going to do any harm to her, but she thought them were [indecipherable] come take her house away, and -- which -- so she had a big pot -- pot -- a big vat, where she cooked the food for the cows, and for the other animals, and she was taking care of all the thing.</span> <span id="s383">The thing was, almost same size like the company -- [indecipherable] company has for cooking their food for the Soviets, in big, round thing.</span> <span id="s384">A tub.</span> <span id="s385">And so she had one of those things in the -- where the cows are, in the --</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: In the barn?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: Where the -- barn.</span> <span id="s388">And she asked, “Is this big enough?”</span> <span id="s389">I said, “That’s good, we can both get in there.”</span> <span id="s390">[indecipherable] big enough, [indecipherable] was clean, you know, but there were now smell of some food or something.</span> <span id="s391">The [indecipherable] smell was making us sick, not the -- not the [indecipherable] smelling food sometime, because we had been -- we had -- the food that we had eaten for -- for a long time was just bread, mainly, and some ba -- bayjay -- what’s the -- what cows eat they cooked in there, and they gave them, and so on.</span> <span id="s392">Th-they this big, and not bir -- [indecipherable] is the German name.</span> <span id="s393">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s394">Let me think.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: Beets, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: Beets, beets.</span> <span id="s399">They’re special beets for animals, okay, but people can eat them, too, when you’re hungry, you can cook them, the beet.</span> <span id="s400">And we used to occasionally steal them from the fields we were working nearby.</span> <span id="s401">And so -- and the woman said we going to stay there, and we hadn’t eaten dinner yet, she’ll cook for us, too.</span> <span id="s402">I didn’t know, and really [indecipherable] back too.</span> <span id="s403">But that’s what they wanted us, to stay overnight there, to get rid of all that [indecipherable] clothing that was full of lice.</span> <span id="s404">When I say full, my clothing must have been crawling with a couple of hundred lice, and [indecipherable], and we were picking up [indecipherable] but -- by having so many -- well, needless to say, we got rid of all our clothes, we went in the tub, she made hot water.</span> <span id="s405">[indecipherable] by that time these guys came with DDT, or something, and all [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s406">And he said, “We gotta shave your hair once more.”</span> <span id="s407">Our hair was short, but had grown back already, little bit.</span> <span id="s408">We don’t want there to be any eggs, or anything like that.</span> <span id="s409">We said okay.</span> <span id="s410">And so we stayed all night.</span> <span id="s411">Next day we moved out, with the [indecipherable] -- and oh, when we got back to the kitchen, they said, “Lieutenant Hovlent was here, he left some clothes for you.”</span> <span id="s412">There was a pile on the floor.</span> <span id="s413">Uniforms, American uniforms.</span> <span id="s414">You going to stay with us, right?</span> <span id="s415">Yes.</span> <span id="s416">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s417">He put some clean belted uniforms on, and no rank on it, because we didn’t have any rank, we were not in the army.</span> <span id="s418">And just a uniform underwear, [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s419">So we looked like them, to make a long story short, we stayed six months with them.</span> <span id="s420">The war was over, but was, you know, we got [indecipherable] sign the armistice, so we never --</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: You stayed -- you stayed with them how long after the war was actually over?</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: Six months.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: Six months.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s425">[indecipherable] the big story which about DP camps, that’s where most people went.</span> <span id="s426">But before I come to that, we stayed with them for so long, and we gained weight, we were healthy again, spoke better English, and then they talked to us, they said, “Well, what are you going to do, we’re going to return to the United States, pretty soon, and we had you here, and you had -- you enjoyed us, we enjoyed you.”</span> <span id="s427">And well, I said, “I will go back to Brussels, where I have a sister of my mother living, was married to a Catholic.</span> <span id="s428">She was the one that sent the cookies to my father, and she’s probably still there,” because in the beginning they didn’t touch mixed marriages in foreign countries.</span> <span id="s429">They were coming there late August, decided when they have time to do it, but there was a war going on, that came first.</span> <span id="s430">And so none of the mixed marriages they didn’t bother with right away.</span> <span id="s431">So, I said, “I’m going back to Brussels because all of my c -- my family agreed that’s where we going to meet, at my aunts.”</span> <span id="s432">And Mike said, “Well, I know my father’s dead, and my brother-in-law.</span> <span id="s433">I don’t know anything about my mother and my sister.</span> <span id="s434">I’m going back to Amsterdam.”</span> <span id="s435">So Lieutenant Hovlent said, “Well, suppose you don’t find anybody there, what are you going to do then?”</span> <span id="s436">[indecipherable] yeah, he said, “You were happy here, a lot of things are still mixed up.</span> <span id="s437">[indecipherable], after the war you can stay with us as long as you wish, til we return to the United States.</span> <span id="s438">But we may stay here for a couple of years, we don’t know.”</span> <span id="s439">So we said fine.</span> <span id="s440">So they made out phony papers, military orders, with my real name on them, and for Mike Swab.</span> <span id="s441">No -- no rank on there, not private or anything, and say Eddie Willner is traveling to Brussels, Belgium by train, by orders of colonel so and so.</span> <span id="s442">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: What was your -- I’m sorry, go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: And I went to Brussels --</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: Okay, before you talk about being in -- in Brussels, what was your impression of the United States, by that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: Oh, we didn’t know much about the United States, they -- except the military.</span> <span id="s447">They were great, they were enthused, they -- everybody tries to help out every, but these are the people that [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s448">There’s another, unfortunately he is dead, too, I mean I found out an address, my wife did research at the computer, Brady Laird was a mess sergeant, he was a nice guy, and then I found his -- he sent me a letter, he said he never married, and the next time I wrote a letter to him, it came back.</span> <span id="s449">He had died.</span> <span id="s450">And so -- Brady [indecipherable], and -- and the -- the other guys we made friends with were a couple of guys, for various reasons.</span> <span id="s451">And one big Texan, he was huge, I have picture, he was the largest man in the company, and when he stood with the arms stretch out, Mike and I were standing under his arms.</span> <span id="s452">I have an picture of that.</span> <span id="s453">He didn’t fit into a tank, he was so big.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: You still have pictures of these times?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s456">And I -- we caught a couple of Nazis then, that -- the German population turned in some guys who are back, and our -- had to undress them, and [indecipherable] the uniform and put in some prisoner’s uniform, and turn over to German police.</span> <span id="s457">And I even put on the German uniform, which I think fitted me, and got a photo of my hands up, and boots on the -- [indecipherable] fun with the company.</span> <span id="s458">We didn’t have any -- any duties, or any work, although we participate a little bit in the kitchen [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: Do you remember what your hopes and -- and dreams were at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: My -- well, my hopes were to find my mother, and father, and -- who knew I was there, and find other member of the family, and to -- I had no plans, except go to Brussels, and maybe walk back to Germany, my hometown, and find my grandfather, [indecipherable] who had been sent to Theresienstadt, and who I don’t bel -- I just found out recently that he died in 1944.</span> <span id="s461">How could an old man, whose 80 years old, last that long in [indecipherable]?</span> <span id="s462">I don’t understand.</span> <span id="s463">I intend to check into it, he -- he was German [indecipherable] but he was a tough old cookie, but still being that way, he -- how an old man survived that long, and die from hunger, like some other.</span> <span id="s464">In Theresienstadt, there was no gas chamber, they managed -- they shot some people, in the mass of people.</span> <span id="s465">There were no max -- mass executions there because Hitler used as a showcase for the Red Cross, and for international.</span> <span id="s466">And my wife and I went to Theresienstadt, and that’s how we went to the room where my gr-grandfather lived.</span> <span id="s467">But I didn’t know at that time that he lived three years, and he had been thrown in a mass grave there, that -- with [indecipherable] but not gas chamber.</span> <span id="s468">When somebody died they didn’t do away with the body, you saw that.</span> <span id="s469">Bu with the --</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: The tape’s going to end, I’m sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: This is tape number two, side A, of an interview with Eddie Willner.</span> <span id="s473">You were just about to talk about going to Belgium right after the war, and ad -- looking for your family.</span> <span id="s474">And what happened when you -- how did you get there?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: By -- I got there by train, and with travel orders from the American army, which was illegal, but nobody questioned, I went.</span> <span id="s476">And Mike Swab went to Amsterdam, he didn’t find anybody from his family, so he went back to the Third Armored Division, and there was -- and [indecipherable] where I don’t find anybody.</span> <span id="s477">I come back and [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: Ex --</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: Mike [indecipherable] got adopted by a soldier from the company, and got that way to the United States.</span> <span id="s480">And I came back to Belgium, I put in my papers, I found a sponsor, and I had to wait for my affidavit to come in -- my paper.</span> <span id="s481">And I was finally -- I finally left the United States, in December, ’47.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: Did it surprise you that the American soldiers were so kind to you, and so concerned about you?</span> <span id="s483">Did you question why they were?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: Yes, in a way I did, but I remember it made me so comfortable.</span> <span id="s485">The only -- frankly, I’m sorry to say, the only guy that made me uncomfortable was a Jewish guy in the unit, because not what he did towards us or anything, it was the way he behaved.</span> <span id="s486">We came out of an anti-Semitic world, or group, and we -- myself -- we behaved, before we became prisoners, while we were prisoners, in a way that normal -- but em -- let me say I didn’t fin -- I hate to say this, cause it sounds like prejudice, but it isn’t.</span> <span id="s487">Jews from eastern Europe are different Jews from western Europe, because they grew up in ghettos, the eastern European, the -- the western u -- was integrated, like my family was.</span> <span id="s488">I didn’t know that I was Jewish until [indecipherable] I didn’t know I was Jewish, I went to synagogue, but it never concerned me, never gave me a problem.</span> <span id="s489">And then came the Jews from the ghettos, and with the pious, and other things, and I was in the impression, the way the Nazis made us look bad, the Jews, they said all Jews are merchants, or they get the money out of pocket of a -- questioned the ma --[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s490">I found out that some of the guys who came from Poland, because of their surroundings, were different people.</span> <span id="s491">And I look at them differently, just like the Germans -- the non-Jewish people looked at Germans who -- or who are Jewish, and [indecipherable] they said they like us.</span> <span id="s492">Whereas in Poland, because living conditions in Poland said these are not [indecipherable] Jews, or whatever, they’re different.</span> <span id="s493">But in -- in the American army, the one Jew that I met in the company was not a nice guy, to start with, and nothing to do with being Jewish, but he did some of the things that Jews were oft accused of.</span> <span id="s494">He tried to make money, and the way he did it, he gambled with soldiers, he took the money out of their pocket.</span> <span id="s495">I’m not saying that non-Jews don’t do that, but I was a little bit more aware of things -- not to be criticized because I -- whatever I do is -- as a money business, or whatever.</span> <span id="s496">I was not in a position to anyway, but -- but there were things this guy did, and had w -- he won quite a bit of money, had already done this on the way over, on the ship, had made thousands of dollars.</span> <span id="s497">And so I -- the others were [indecipherable] and they saw this, too.</span> <span id="s498">And they saw that we didn’t associate very much with him, unless he associated with us, he was a -- and he was from New York.</span> <span id="s499">He was what you might call a ghetto type.</span> <span id="s500">Now, New York the ghetto, too.</span> <span id="s501">So New York Jews, I -- I -- I when people ask me where you from, some people think I’m from New York, cause I pick up a little accent from the three months I was there.</span> <span id="s502">And -- and so I wa -- I wasn’t very proud of him, he did a lot of things that didn’t make me proud to be a Jew, or something I could -- you could say.</span> <span id="s503">I was ashamed for him.</span> <span id="s504">And so your answer to your question that the American were nice, yes, they -- they were nice, I found this guy Hansen, didn’t speak German because he -- he felt very badly about, from a moral viewpoint that this happened by his former people that he came from.</span> <span id="s505">And he didn’t like that.</span> <span id="s506">Like Lieutenant Hovlent was -- I found out after the war, was very religious, that’s why he behaved that way, and the guys also, I -- I compare notes with many people, but soldiers behave different in war -- in the war [indecipherable] conditions.</span> <span id="s507">Like the villages we were in, guys thought about taking the women, maybe the husband wasn’t there, and didn’t make any difference to them, and [indecipherable] it didn’t happen our unit, not that anybody got caught, but -- but the guy that I don’t -- didn’t like, he would have been capable of doing such a thing.</span> <span id="s508">He tried it one time, and I -- we told him, Mike and I, sta -- stop.</span> <span id="s509">He came to the [indecipherable], I told you about that farm woman, that made the hot water for us.</span> <span id="s510">He wanted to go to bed with her, and he put his weapon on the table like -- like a threat.</span> <span id="s511">I -- and, “Louie, don’t do that.</span> <span id="s512">I don’t want to be a part of this.</span> <span id="s513">I had my problems with the Germans.</span> <span id="s514">I -- I do-don’t do this because I love the Nazis, or that, but this is a human being, don’t do this.</span> <span id="s515">There’s no -- this woman is not a -- walk around in uniform with the Nazis, tha -- she is just plain farm woman, and her husband’s at the front because he was ordered that way.</span> <span id="s516">And you don’t do this, be -- how would you come a soldier into your home?”</span> <span id="s517">And he ever -- absolutely had been drinking too.</span> <span id="s518">And we told him that he better go home to his home.</span> <span id="s519">And he kept on, and we took away his rifle, because we thought he might -- not do anything to us, but [indecipherable] well, and we just [indecipherable] that he was the only one that we knew -- there may have been another guy was Jewish, but -- but we had good experiences too, after, and -- with Jews, and non-Jews.</span> <span id="s520">But he gave me a bitter taste in the mouth, and I -- he got married, and later had kids, I called him, and [indecipherable] but I never went to visit him, I just talked to him on the phone, you know.</span> <span id="s521">And the guys was nice to us, why, I -- well, basically because what we had endured.</span> <span id="s522">And there were many, and they’d seen pictures in the paper, and read about it.</span> <span id="s523">So they probably felt a little sorry for us, but we didn’t feel sorry for ourselves, so there was no problem.</span> <span id="s524">We weren’t -- we were treated okay, like men, and -- and there were talks about them, we’ll find a way -- they want to go to the United States, which Michael did.</span> <span id="s525">So [indecipherable] many nice people there, aga -- or say that you thought the Americans were nice.</span> <span id="s526">And we found out that a lot of them were of different background, like Louie was one, then we found Irish Catholic, and we found all kinds of religions.</span> <span id="s527">And maybe because some guys were religious, or believers, that’s why they were nice.</span> <span id="s528">And people were not so nice.</span> <span id="s529">Cannot say that they were not religious, but they -- th-they -- people like [indecipherable] that I said about Jews now, I [indecipherable] for the other Poles too, who were not Jews, we had many experiences with them, too.</span> <span id="s530">Some of them were worse than the Germans, some of them were in guards, or were [indecipherable] from the area, were sometime with Germany, and sometimes not.</span> <span id="s531">And when we had Poles as supervisors for our work, they beat us like the SS did.</span> <span id="s532">So, I cannot make statement, all American are nice, or all are bad, or Jews, or whatever.</span> <span id="s533">And -- or Italians are a certain way.</span> <span id="s534">Yeah, I think that it’s -- it -- it’s [indecipherable], and we found out very early that we didn’t -- like Nick Hansen was German [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s535">I disagreed with him, I said, “Talk to these people, not all of them are bad.</span> <span id="s536">If all of them had been bad, I wouldn’t be here today.</span> <span id="s537">There were some good ones.”</span> <span id="s538">But I -- my experience has been talking to people -- Americans, maybe Jewish people savay, that those who were not in the camps, hate the Germans more than the wa -- than the ones who were in the camp.</span> <span id="s539">That’s an unusual thing.</span> <span id="s540">Because they say all Germans are bad, some of them are -- all -- all the Nazis are, they make -- don’t differentiate be -- no Nazis.</span> <span id="s541">And so I saw Poles who -- that were very bad, and who are -- had German SS, and some of the Poles, and know, you find bad and good everywhere, but being good, and being able to do good, also had something to do with material things.</span> <span id="s542">United States is a rich country.</span> <span id="s543">We had soldier chocolate there, had everything to eat.</span> <span id="s544">And it’s easy to be a good guy sometimes, when you have a lot of things, if that’s what needed, bread, or something to eat, be hungry.</span> <span id="s545">And then somebody -- the -- the person I feel is sometimes really good, a real great person, when they don’t have much, and then give away something.</span> <span id="s546">And right now, I did pretty well in life, professionally.</span> <span id="s547">I worked hard, and I -- I’m glad I’m not dependent on German government because I came out sick for the rest of my life, and get a small pension.</span> <span id="s548">The business that’s going on now in getting back for the Jews, the -- some of the things that they owned, paintings, or getting pension, because they -- bec -- like Social Security, they say if you worked as slave labor, but -- but the companies that that used your slave labor should pay you compensation.</span> <span id="s549">I filed for it, I didn’t want to.</span> <span id="s550">My wife did for me, I sign it, because I -- I certainly earned it, and I yi -- I -- I know -- I know I wor -- worked for what German companies, but I said they should have given it -- most people are dead already -- right after the war, and they’re -- they’re waiting so long til they’re -- no -- not many left any more.</span> <span id="s551">So when the money comes, I’ll take it, but I am not going to use it for myself, I’m going to give it away.</span> <span id="s552">To my wife, who has been good to me, can do whatever she wants, and some percentage to a good cause, not necessarily a Jewish good cause.</span> <span id="s553">In my donations, I include the others as well as Jews.</span> <span id="s554">And I don’t need their money, and I -- I tell you, I’m torn from the experience that really upset me.</span> <span id="s555">I got myself examined by Germany, to file for [indecipherable] you know what the [indecipherable] is?</span> <span id="s556">Making [indecipherable], and normally you do that if you have a -- something happen to you, and you get -- you need medi -- medical help for your life, and the Germans pay for it, some extent.</span> <span id="s557">Well, number one, I went in the army, for various reasons, to give something back to this country, as a civil service employee, in the army now, in the army, also as a volunteer.</span> <span id="s558">And like I said, I got exa-examined, and they said to me, some people, “Yeah, but you -- you act like a -- like the strong guy, you’re a military officer.”</span> <span id="s559">He -- some -- some people said, “You don’t look sick to me.”</span> <span id="s560">And I said, “I’m not, I,” -- but -- but when you go in the -- the Germans, you got to tell them you -- you suffer.</span> <span id="s561">I didn’t.</span> <span id="s562">That’s ridiculous.</span> <span id="s563">I’m not suffering, I’m happy, I don’t need them, and -- but I did get myself examined, and they didn’t pass the law, whether you have something or not, you get the minimum, if you have been one year in a camp, or more.</span> <span id="s564">So -- but then they came up with something else, not -- couple of years ago, which is like Social Security, say they worked, but they didn’t pay in, but we owe it to them.</span> <span id="s565">We didn’t pay them, si -- they came out with German Social Security, and they sent me a letter, and they said, “Yes, you entitled that, but you must pay in the basic sum, so we can start in to -- to make it so many quarters, you don’t have enough.”</span> <span id="s566">Or whatever, I -- I [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s567">So I did that, and I figure I earned that.</span> <span id="s568">And they said, “In your -- with your background, you got yourself education after the war, which we consider college education, [indecipherable] military [indecipherable], and you -- so -- so you entitled to it.</span> <span id="s569">Who are you -- did you work for?”</span> <span id="s570">And I did say it, and send the papers in.</span> <span id="s571">And then they said, “You got to get this exam done by a doctor in Washing, who is a confidential” -- not -- what do you call it, not confidential, who do it confidentially for the German embassy.</span> <span id="s572">I went to see the doctor, was a German [indecipherable] in Washing, who had been taken prisoner in Africa, by Rommel, Africa corps.</span> <span id="s573">No, he was in Africa, but he was taken prisoner by the British.</span> <span id="s574">I start undressing for him to examine me, he said, “We’re the same age.”</span> <span id="s575">And, “You were in a concentration camp?”</span> <span id="s576">“Yeah.”</span> <span id="s577">“Oh yeah,” he say, “you have a number.”</span> <span id="s578">And then I took all my clothes off, he said, “You look better than I do, physically.”</span> <span id="s579">Whatever that meant, and [indecipherable] would see that he was going to give me negative, say this guy’s in perfect shape, he [indecipherable] a mark on him.</span> <span id="s580">Well, I have a mark here.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: You have a scar on the back of your head.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: How did you get that scar?</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: Well, that was from a big shot in the camps, and they took some guys for example, they fired, and they going to liquidate us, an example.</span> <span id="s587">And I came out I think I have it on the tape.</span> <span id="s588">We were left for dead, and the -- well they told me to use that, but the only thing I -- I was disqualified from the U.S. Army after one parachute jump.</span> <span id="s589">They told me that I should not jump, I am not going to be a jump bump -- this is a good thing to do if you -- if you [indecipherable] to jump, y-yo -- to show you got courage, to jump out an air-airplane.</span> <span id="s590">So the young officers all did it, I want to do it, too.</span> <span id="s591">And by the way, my children, [indecipherable] five out of six are par-parachutists.</span> <span id="s592">So, they had to do what the old man couldn’t do.</span> <span id="s593">But anyway, then, so this Social Security from Germany, the guy, he -- I thought he is going to send me a confidential report.</span> <span id="s594">He send it to the embassy.</span> <span id="s595">I didn’t see what he wrote, but he wrote nothing good for me that was in my favor, and nevertheless -- well, he probably was a Nazi, or anti-Semite.</span> <span id="s596">I don’t know what he -- I had that feeling all along, that he thought I was getting something for nothing, and -- and I didn’t, you know, I was entitled to it.</span> <span id="s597">So anyway, when he came out, they made a ruling.</span> <span id="s598">After checking what could I have been, if I had, under normal circumstance, not in a concentration camp, not having to go in the army to make a living, and to -- what could I have been today?</span> <span id="s599">They gave a wide -- well, they gave me a high category, officer in the army alone, that the same thing, had went to college, or you become a -- a teacher, you have to have a certain intelligence, and they told me they going to give me a high rating in Social Security, but in that case, if I want a higher -- rating higher income, I have to pay them anyswhere between 20 and 40,000 dollar, whatever I choose of categories.</span> <span id="s600">It is not well known, but the reason was -- and if I do not choose the high income, the lowest one is you pay in 2,000 dollars, and you get [indecipherable] income when you’re 65.</span> <span id="s601">Well, we had some friends in German embassy, and some other people [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s602">And there is Leo, [indecipherable] language when they have the German, and this guy was the German finantha a -- finance attaché at the embassy here.</span> <span id="s603">And -- and he said what -- any -- I said, if I had 20,000 dollar, 40,000 dollar, I -- I’d rather invest it in here, in this country.</span> <span id="s604">I don’t know what’s going to be Germany to-tomorrow, but I’m not going to give them any money.</span> <span id="s605">I don’t have that money to spare, and I -- it just didn’t feel good about it.</span> <span id="s606">But the mistake I made [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s607">So I -- I gave them 2,000 dollars.</span> <span id="s608">They advised me I should get my foot into the door, I’m entitled to it [indecipherable] like those thing, but to -- to give to the la -- and then they give me small sum.</span> <span id="s609">Well, they came out with a small sum which was so insulting that I immediate -- I -- I didn’t get upset very often about things I -- they’re sending me every month a check, they have been for three, four years now, for 46 dollars.</span> <span id="s610">I think that’s an insult for somebody who spent three years in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s611">And that becau -- now, if I would have given them 40,000 dollars, I’m probably -- I don’t know how much, I’d probably get a thousand dollar a month income.</span> <span id="s612">I didn’t do that.</span> <span id="s613">Well, I -- I would have liked to have that kind of money coming in, but I -- I -- I don’t, and I do very well without them.</span> <span id="s614">But the small check is an insult, I think, for anybody, not because I [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s615">I -- I -- I -- every time I see that they have money come in -- so --</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: Did you feel any hatred or -- towards the Germans right after the war, or desire for revenge at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: No.</span> <span id="s618">When it comes to revenge, my friend Mike Swab tried some revenge, and I stopped him, because revenge is good for people who maybe you know did something bad to your family, or to -- killed people now -- SS, particularly.</span> <span id="s619">I feel -- felt that -- I guess if you know something about somebody, and the SS officer came to one of the towns that we occupied when I was with the tank company, and Mike went up there, I didn’t know about it, had taken this gun along, we all were given a -- we both were given a caliber 45 pistol in case there was some problem.</span> <span id="s620">But we were not to wear it, because we weren’t [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s621">We didn’t even have any documents [indecipherable], but they were nice, and they said just in case, never know what happens.</span> <span id="s622">There may be a -- what they call the werewolf, they may start again.</span> <span id="s623">A terrorism attack against the Americans, even if the war is finished, whatever.</span> <span id="s624">It didn’t happen in Germany, but they hated, like Mike, and -- I -- I can’t even say he had hated, he [indecipherable] make it even with some people, this guy was an SS officer, whom some Nazis -- some -- no, not nat -- some of the people in -- in whose house we lived thewa, had said, “Well, these guys were in a concentration camp, he -- he got to be known around town that two of the guys with the Americans were in concentration.</span> <span id="s625">Well some people feel really bad, and want to make -- do -- do us a favor by coming to us and saying, “In that house, that’s not even occupied is a big Nazi, or an SS officer.”</span> <span id="s626">So somebody had told Mike there’s an SS officer came back, and then I [indecipherable] myself and Mike, we both would red if we saw an SS, particularly an officer.</span> <span id="s627">And most of the SS were bad.</span> <span id="s628">There was such a thing as the waffer SS, you probably know, that’s [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s629">But they were bad.</span> <span id="s630">So he had gone to this house, and I thought he was going to kill this guy.</span> <span id="s631">He pistol whipped him, he hit him.</span> <span id="s632">When I hear screaming, I went in, and Michael said to me, “This is an SS.</span> <span id="s633">I want to kill the son of a bitch.”</span> <span id="s634">Well, I said, “No, Mike.</span> <span id="s635">I don’t have any sympathy for this guy, but you going to be in jail again.</span> <span id="s636">You came out on one, you’re going into another jail because it’s against the law in Germany, and you don’t know if this guy -- what he did.</span> <span id="s637">If you happen to know, maybe I can underst-stand, and other people will understand, too.</span> <span id="s638">If you knew him yourself, in a camp, or something, I think.</span> <span id="s639">But not this guy.”</span> <span id="s640">Also was crippled, by the way, and I figured he’s been punished.</span> <span id="s641">But we got out of there, [indecipherable], and I said, “Michael, don’t ever do this again.</span> <span id="s642">I’ll be your friend for life, but my,” -- talking about Mike [indecipherable] about him.</span> <span id="s643">My license plate on my car is Michael’s number on -- that was his arm.</span> <span id="s644">So I don’t ever forget Michael.</span> <span id="s645">When he lived in New York, and he died of cancer, he was married twice, the first wife died of cancer, too.</span> <span id="s646">He had a lot of bad luck.</span> <span id="s647">And when he knew he was dying, in Holland, I went to see him.</span> <span id="s648">And in Holland, you can die at home, [indecipherable] and you can also be given a pill to h-hasten it, you know?</span> <span id="s649">I don’t know what he did, but he knew he was dying, and my oldest son, and my oldest daughter came [indecipherable] to them, they decided.</span> <span id="s650">And like I said, a couple of years ago I put a lifesaver card, they ask me [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s651">I wasn’t going to sell my whole story at that, I just [indecipherable] my best friend had this number, and then he died.</span> <span id="s652">And you’re going to make one special for you.</span> <span id="s653">So I didn’t tell him the story, so they said the governor allows only this and that.</span> <span id="s654">I said, “Look, I go as far as [indecipherable] necessary.”</span> <span id="s655">I think I want to do that a lot of people put on their right now what they -- they’re a veteran, or won a -- a m -- a medal.</span> <span id="s656">But this guy was in concentration camp with me, and we both made it, and that’s why I want this special number.</span> <span id="s657">And I have that now permanently on my car.</span> <span id="s658">Some people said, “Well you don’t want to be reminded every day for the camp.”</span> <span id="s659">I’m not.</span> <span id="s660">I used to, but I do think of Mike, at least once a day.</span> <span id="s661">And I told his second wife [indecipherable] no consequence because he doesn’t have that feeling for things like that.</span> <span id="s662">He’s buried in Holland, as a Master Sargent in the U.S. Air Force.</span> <span id="s663">He went into U.S. Air Force, and he’s the one [indecipherable] so Michael -- we left this SS, and he didn’t do it any more.</span> <span id="s664">So Mike tir -- hated.</span> <span id="s665">I decided that hatred is bad.</span> <span id="s666">If you hate somebody who did something bad to you.</span> <span id="s667">It nags on you, it -- it -- it eats you up, hatred, and you become a bad person yourself.</span> <span id="s668">It’s no good.</span> <span id="s669">I’ve seen many people who will hate the German [indecipherable] German, and they say Nazis.</span> <span id="s670">I can understand that somewhat, or you find in Germany [indecipherable] today.</span> <span id="s671">I found some.</span> <span id="s672">I found some here, but -- in the army, but not bad for me to get excited about it.</span> <span id="s673">I think that’s natural for some people to hate one or another fo -- or for one reason or another.</span> <span id="s674">The people way Jews hate them because they originally taught that for awhile.</span> <span id="s675">The present Pope has tried to correct it, but in -- in United States, it doesn’t bother me if somebody’s anti-Semite.</span> <span id="s676">I can tell them to go to hell.</span> <span id="s677">I can tell them in Germany too, to go to hell today, and nothing happen.</span> <span id="s678">People in Germany have different feelings.</span> <span id="s679">If he then -- End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: -- was an enlisted man after I came into the United States, went into the army, and I wanted to become officer, but I couldn’t because one, mostly for educational reason.</span> <span id="s681">I stopped my formal education in Germany when I was in seventh grade, and then I went to school in [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s682">So what --</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q: Okay, where --</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: We just said something about --</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: Okay, we’re back after a break, and -- and -- and we’re going to just continue with that thought that we stopped with.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: I want to tell you, the reason it doesn’t bother me here, because I know that no action will be taken, prejudicial action.</span> <span id="s687">That somebody makes a bad comment, it’s a free country, free speech, and to me, that’s a greater thing here, living in this democracy, that it’s not you’ll have good food to eat, or be [indecipherable] one time, and that I -- this -- this [indecipherable] that as far as food is concerned, and many other thing, but the bigger thing with me is free speech; that I can say anything I want.</span> <span id="s688">That I say in the office, I’m working for the government, the president’s a jerk, I don’t have to worry about the police coming, picking me up at home because I said something against the president, I’m a government employee.</span> <span id="s689">This democracy, too.</span> <span id="s690">For people who never -- who were exposed to that, and we were always afraid of saying thing, [indecipherable] opinion about something, it means a lot.</span> <span id="s691">For somebody never had, like North Americans, it’s -- it -- it doesn’t -- it’s not very important, because every day we have an example, we say things that under a dictatorship you couldn’t say, and you have to worry about it.</span> <span id="s692">So I feel free that even if something bad had said, nothing’s going to come of it, they’re not going to smash somebody’s windows because of that.</span> <span id="s693">It’s just an expression here, and it’s like somebody said something about Blacks, nigger.</span> <span id="s694">My next door neighbor was very prejudiced when I moved in.</span> <span id="s695">He’s my best friend in the street right now, a-always has been -- not all -- not in the beginning, but I noticed their opinion about Blacks, and they talked about niggers.</span> <span id="s696">And our swimming pool here was segregated.</span> <span id="s697">I didn’t know that, but when I want apply for membership, I found out that my next door neighbor’s also the president of the swim club.</span> <span id="s698">And I went over to him, because you needed two people to sponsor you.</span> <span id="s699">That’s how Blacks never got into the pool, because some people were already in the pool, were not [indecipherable] some Black person to get in.</span> <span id="s700">Went to see my neighbor, and I said, “Look, I know you don’t take any Blacks into the swimming pool.</span> <span id="s701">I want to join the pool, but you probably not going to sponsor me.</span> <span id="s702">And I don’t feel the -- about Blacks the way you do.</span> <span id="s703">It’s just blind prejudice, I don’t think you -- I think you a good person, but you grew up that way, to -- not to like Negroes.</span> <span id="s704">And you get together people who think the same thing.”</span> <span id="s705">And when the hou-house were being built here, the superintendent said -- he had some Black workers here, and when he talked about Black workers, “Watch when they walk on the new grass.</span> <span id="s706">Don’t let them walk on it.”</span> <span id="s707">And I said, “Why?”</span> <span id="s708">“Where a Black walks on grass, no grass will ever grow again.”</span> <span id="s709">“Are you kidding?”</span> <span id="s710">I said, “You don’t mean that.</span> <span id="s711">A joke or something?”</span> <span id="s712">“No,” he said wa -- and that’s the superintendent [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s713">The next door neighbor didn’t say anything about that, so I know how he thinks.</span> <span id="s714">So when I came to him the application, I said, “You probably not going to sponsor me, because you know how I feel about Blacks.”</span> <span id="s715">“Oh here, let me think about it.”</span> <span id="s716">Boy, and I give him time to think about it.</span> <span id="s717">You know, I didn’t want to start to be the troublemaker in the neighborhood.</span> <span id="s718">So I went to my wife, and I said, “I don’t think I want to join the pool here.”</span> <span id="s719">Which would be a good thing for the children.</span> <span id="s720">And then I decided, well, I’m also depriving the children, my wife had to -- we had only one car, I have the car, and she -- it’s good for the health to go in the summer to the pool.</span> <span id="s721">I think I -- I -- I’m going to talk to him.</span> <span id="s722">I went to him, and he said, “I’ll sign you on, and I -- I get you another member to sign.”</span> <span id="s723">I said, “Good.</span> <span id="s724">But I also want you to know I’m not joining your pool to be a troublemaker.</span> <span id="s725">I don’t agree with your policies, and they going to be changed one day, and you know which side I’m going to vote for, to let the Blacks in.”</span> <span id="s726">And I felt that was necessary to say [indecipherable] know what kind of neighbor I am, and maybe he -- he won’t have any part of me, but we became good friends, and he does anything for me I want him to do.</span> <span id="s727">He knows I’m Jewish, and they’re Southern Baptists.</span> <span id="s728">And Southern Baptists were automatically against Blacks in those days.</span> <span id="s729">I went out with a girl one time in Richmond, when I went to school [indecipherable] and she was Southern Baptist, she took me on Sunday morning to a church, and I said, “I’m -- this -- I don’t see any Blacks in here.”</span> <span id="s730">“Oh,” she said, “they’re not welcome.”</span> <span id="s731">I say, “In a church?</span> <span id="s732">Well, let’s go then,” I said.</span> <span id="s733">“I don’t want to be in a church -- I’m not very religious, but I don’t want to be in a church that doesn’t let everybody in.</span> <span id="s734">That’s no church for me.”</span> <span id="s735">So, come back to my neighbor, they don’t call Blacks by nasty name.</span> <span id="s736">They are very dilerant.</span> <span id="s737">Their son, Ned Fortune, also called them niggers, and when he was very small, he changed.</span> <span id="s738">When he talked to my children, my children told him they don’t like they u -- to use that word.</span> <span id="s739">And I really can see where he had a change of mind.</span> <span id="s740">He grew up that way, and his wife grew up that way.</span> <span id="s741">So, that’s why I think, in a democracy, where you can say every -- anything you want.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: What do you think made him change his mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s743">A: I just started thinking about it.</span> <span id="s744">I don’t remember at the time, but I would say that he basically thinks I was right, and he did find out about me, what I went through through the war, and he -- he was an en-engineer with the telephone company.</span> <span id="s745">And he -- he -- he grew up saying this -- calling people that name, and that was just a daily thing where he came from, and his wife.</span> <span id="s746">And he had second thought about that, and -- and to -- and to add something to that story, his son, who is getting married next week, and we the only people in the street who are invited to his wedding.</span> <span id="s747">That shows you how good friends we are, we are.</span> <span id="s748">Their son went to William and Mary.</span> <span id="s749">I think he went.</span> <span id="s750">And he -- his roommate was a Black guy.</span> <span id="s751">And he changed his mind by living with a Black guy from Africa, not American Black.</span> <span id="s752">And he doesn’t -- he didn’t use the word any mo -- [indecipherable], but he still went to college, if he would have known beforehand that his roommate was a different color, he prob -- may [indecipherable], but he didn’t.</span> <span id="s753">He had a good experience with this Black guy, and he is changed.</span> <span id="s754">And he getting married now.</span> <span id="s755">So, Freedom of Speech, the greater thing, as far as I’m concerned, in my life in the United States.</span> <span id="s756">I have to g -- if I want to complain about something, I can go and complain.</span> <span id="s757">My children haven’t been handled properly by people, by authority, by -- I have good example there, and people did not think -- I didn’t -- never think -- I never thought, for instance, being Jewish I carry a chip on my shoulder, or it’s something that I have to be ashamed of.</span> <span id="s758">I’m not even saying I’m proud of it either, but I’m proud to be a Jew -- I’m not proud to be anything else either, but I can be proud of something I’ve accomplished.</span> <span id="s759">But, well, maybe my ancestors accomplished something, that’s why people call them a proud Jew.</span> <span id="s760">But I -- the people who are anti-Semitic here in the United States, can be fought against openly.</span> <span id="s761">In other countries, they call themselves democracy, but are not a real democracy.</span> <span id="s762">And we have things that leave something to be desired, to -- maybe not the Jewish [indecipherable] something else, or the Black, particularly, have -- they’re still being prejudiced.</span> <span id="s763">I always said, well, as a Jew I can go [indecipherable] have the right color.</span> <span id="s764">But if you’re Black on top of it, you don’t accept in the first place, just because of your color.</span> <span id="s765">But in America, there are many people -- and America has changed, even during the ti-time I’ve been here, for the better.</span> <span id="s766">It’s not perfect, it never claimed to be perfect in question of race, or -- or many other thing, but we can change things here, as long as we stay a democracy, and have the [indecipherable] the -- that we have, the -- the -- if you discuss this wi -- Germany, for instance, there still is this not anti-Semitism, not Hitlerism, or anything, but what basically in German’s eye, my wife will -- like we could have -- like a -- [indecipherable] sometimes too arrogant, and with this arrogance there comes this prejudice, or they say this guy is this or that.</span> <span id="s767">The -- some people have certain traits, Jews have certain traits, some of them not too good, and some are good traits.</span> <span id="s768">I always point out on TV when somebody is Jewish.</span> <span id="s769">And my wife asked me one time, “Why do you think that he is Jewish?”</span> <span id="s770">Not because of her [indecipherable] had to impress her, but I think the children should -- they -- that’s one part of the learning process, that you can be proud of some people -- when it’s a criminal that’s being shown on TV that is Jewish, or -- certainly not.</span> <span id="s771">But I want to point out that people who invented the -- a good example, in 19 -- soon after we got married, I was ordered by the army for 10 days to Brussels, from Germany, to go attend the World Fair, and to visit the Soviet pavilion there, and look at some things.</span> <span id="s772">And I don’t [indecipherable] and I went the second time with the American joint media, we came from Washington, I came from Heidelburg, and because he didn’t speak German, they said, “Take him under your wings, he’s one of our people,” or -- you know, key people, “and show him around.”</span> <span id="s773">[indecipherable] too new to it, you already have some experience with speaking the language.</span> <span id="s774">So this guy turns out to be a Christian American who was a -- who are the people who -- they are very simple religion, they all speak up.</span> <span id="s775">I can’t remember the name now, but is their religion.</span> <span id="s776">Not -- they have a very simple church.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: Quaker?</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: Quaker, yeah, Quaker.</span> <span id="s779">Very nice man, but he was anti-German.</span> <span id="s780">He told me on a boat about [indecipherable] my wife was my fiancée then, how I could marry a German.</span> <span id="s781">And nothing.</span> <span id="s782">I was German, too.</span> <span id="s783">I was Jewish as my religion, but so she was not a Nazi or something like that.</span> <span id="s784">And to me it’s -- I don’t think it makes any difference.</span> <span id="s785">But we walked in the German pavilion from the Russian pavilion, and in the entrance hall had life-size picture of a German no-Nobel Prize winners.</span> <span id="s786">And a -- more than a third or so were Jews, German Jews.</span> <span id="s787">And this man, who was a Quaker, high ranking in -- in the Palmer defense, said to me, “Look at this.”</span> <span id="s788">And I said, “I noticed, I know.”</span> <span id="s789">“I don’t get it,” he said.</span> <span id="s790">We sat down the table eat lunch, the cafeteria, and there was a lack of space, and the waiter came over, and said, “Excuse me, you have a table for -- you’re only two.</span> <span id="s791">I have two students here, would like to sit down, they’re tired.</span> <span id="s792">Would you mind I seat them at your table?”</span> <span id="s793">“No, go ahead.”</span> <span id="s794">They sat down the table, they happened to be German students, and this guy saw red, the guy that was with me.</span> <span id="s795">And he said, “Did you see,” -- he addressed the German student, “did you see the Nobel Prize winners that are on -- how can you have the nerve, Jews that you persecuted, take credit for them in your entrance hall?”</span> <span id="s796">And I was shocked, and th -- I knew that -- but I didn’t know he was going to talk like that, and one of the German students said, “Well sir, that was -- these people were before Hitler, and after Hitler, and Hitler did that, about the Jews.</span> <span id="s797">And we are proud of them today again.</span> <span id="s798">I’m glad we are proud of them again, that they were Germans of the Jewish religion, who won the Nobel Prize.”</span> <span id="s799">But I never could convince this American that I married a German, and several times happened to me here, in particularly Jewish people.</span> <span id="s800">My own family [indecipherable], and the only family I had left [indecipherable] was in New York, a distant relatives.</span> <span id="s801">I stayed with them for three months before I went to the army.</span> <span id="s802">I slept in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s803">They had come in themselves to the United States right after the war, and they -- when they were in Bolivia.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Q: How were they related to you, and what were their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: They -- the -- this was my father’s sister, Paula Friedlander, and my uncle Herbert Friedlander.</span> <span id="s806">They daughter is still living in Florida, only five -- five years older than I am.</span> <span id="s807">And where were we ma --</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: So you were living with them the first few months that you came?</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: You wa -- I want to say [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: Did it relate to the -- to the anti-German?</span> <span id="s811">Something about --</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s813">My cousin lives in Florida, send a letter to me in Germany, I said I was going to get married, how could I marry a German?</span> <span id="s814">These were German Jews from Berlin, and she couldn’t understand.</span> <span id="s815">A matter of fact, came to a point where she was insulting.</span> <span id="s816">It wasn’t about not being Jewish, but about being German.</span> <span id="s817">If your not Jewish they had no problem with that, they were non-religious.</span> <span id="s818">So then I said to her, “First of all, you are German, too, of the Jewish religion, or you were.”</span> <span id="s819">And then you have to know the person, know the family.</span> <span id="s820">In her case, I checked it out, they were not Nazi family.</span> <span id="s821">I could not, I don’t think, for her parent’s sake, that I could not marry Nazi family, who maybe were anti-Semitic before I changed their mind.</span> <span id="s822">Even though their daughter may not be responsible for this [indecipherable] it would be hard thing to do.</span> <span id="s823">You very much in love with somebody, you can do a lot of thing.</span> <span id="s824">I -- I could have married in the family Nazi, bu -- but in -- I’m getting off the subject -- in my office in Heidelberg was a soldier, a rabbi’s son, who married a German whose family were big Nazis, and who told him never to come to their home [indecipherable] Nazis after the war.</span> <span id="s825">And in my case, with my cousin Flora, I then told her, “Look, if you will not accept my wife, you don’t have to -- you don’t have to come to my house.</span> <span id="s826">I don’t come to yours either, and I don’t want anything to do with you any more.</span> <span id="s827">You reject her and you don’t even know her.</span> <span id="s828">You judge a person not by the family -- I mean sometimes you can, but not -- in this case absolutely not.</span> <span id="s829">So if you remain with this opinion or position, let this be the last letter between us, because I’m going to live with her, not with you.</span> <span id="s830">So it’s important to me.”</span> <span id="s831">So my aunt, her mother, wrote back to me.</span> <span id="s832">“I know how you feel about the family, we haven’t got many left.</span> <span id="s833">Don’t do this, cutting her off, not writing her any more, seeing her any more, some,” -- but I said, “I agree with you, very few people left.</span> <span id="s834">I am not making decision, she is making decision.</span> <span id="s835">So I don’t have to -- if she is against my wife, she is against me, and I don’t like people who make judgments without knowing the facts, without knowing the person.”</span> <span id="s836">To make a long story short, I married her, and because of my job I was changed -- I’m coming back to that again with some other thing [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s837">I beca -- security, with a top secret project I was working on, they say he cannot be married -- the American army said, “He cannot be married to a foreigner.”</span> <span id="s838">As a matter of fact, even worse, not to somebody from the East Block country, East Germany, and -- because I’m working on -- on a secret project.</span> <span id="s839">So, the army said, “We’re not going to give you permission to get married.”</span> <span id="s840">But they changed their mind later on, he got cleared, and I -- I married her.</span> <span id="s841">I -- I threatened the army that I’m going to resign my commi -- “You cannot stop me from marrying her.</span> <span id="s842">You -- you -- because I’m going to resign my commission and leave the army.</span> <span id="s843">I have served enough time, I can get out any time I want to.”</span> <span id="s844">And they said, “Don’t do that, don’t make that quick judgment.”</span> <span id="s845">“Well,” I said, “you stop me from getting married.</span> <span id="s846">If you come with me and say that she’s an east German spy, that’s why [indecipherable], and I have top secret knowledge, I can see, but you checked her out, that everything’s okay.”</span> <span id="s847">So to make a long story short, because of this assignment that was pending -- I didn’t know about that, they send me and her to United States, and she became citizen, three weeks.</span> <span id="s848">They cleared her, and my boss said, she’s as clean as [indecipherable] family -- about Communism, not about Nazism, but I checked that out too, in the meantime, on a -- in a personal way.</span> <span id="s849">That was a k --</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: How did you check it out?</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: I had friends who had access to paper, secret papers in the army.</span> <span id="s852">I was intelligence officer, and there were other intelligence officers.</span> <span id="s853">So my boss, the colonel, came to me and said, “We agree, and I tell you something, that they won’t tell you, but you work for me, that in everything I checked on your wife -- your future wife, came out as white as a sheet.</span> <span id="s854">Absolutely [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s855">Nothing suspicious.</span> <span id="s856">So -- but the new job that we have you -- we have planned for you, your wife has to be a citizen if she is -- cannot be a German wa -- particularly from East Germany.</span> <span id="s857">So, the general wants to come and s-see you.</span> <span id="s858">He -- he wants you to come and see him.”</span> <span id="s859">A-And so I went to see the general, and he said, “Well Willner, we have you scheduled for a nice, plushy job.</span> <span id="s860">You going to work as our liaison officer at the German Central Intelligence Agency, okay?</span> <span id="s861">But a requirement there is that your wife be an American citizen.”</span> <span id="s862">If the guy is married that the job is given to.</span> <span id="s863">“Well,” I said, “sir, you know the problems we had first, and so you are -- he -- you find out what -- you find out what I can do for you to get your wife to be a citizen, yeah.”</span> <span id="s864">He -- he already knew, but he just wanted me to go through a procedure, to see what’s involved.</span> <span id="s865">Well, in the middle of the week, had all the information I needed, I went back to the general, and he made the statement -- made the statement, sent me to the Chief of Staff of the army in Germany, in Europe, and another general, and they s -- made -- gave off -- they gave statements that in the interest of U.S. security, my wife is to become a citizen as soon as possible.</span> <span id="s866">They didn’t say that I was scheduled for a new job, that’s why -- they just said that -- they send us on a military plane back here, and my wife became a citizen in three weeks.</span> <span id="s867">She studied on the plane all the question they might ask her.</span> <span id="s868">So, she became a cit -- series -- I had to wait three -- three and a half years, and I was in the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: We have a couple minutes of --</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: So, we came back to Heidelberg, and her job -- she -- I met her in the American headquarters, where she worked when she wasn’t studying.</span> <span id="s871">She was studying languages at the University of Heidelberg, and when she didn’t have any money left, she went to work with the Americans, in an office.</span> <span id="s872">When she had enough money, she went back to the university.</span> <span id="s873">Well, since she was already working in -- on -- without having a clear [indecipherable] needed up there, she worked on some non-classified stuff, but she had a German salary.</span> <span id="s874">When we came back from the United States, she was an American citizen, and her boss was an American, of course, civilian.</span> <span id="s875">He said, “You posi -- your job has changed.</span> <span id="s876">I couldn’t keep you, because you not germ -- German any more.</span> <span id="s877">This position was for a German.”</span> <span id="s878">She said, “Okay.</span> <span id="s879">What job have you got for me?”</span> <span id="s880">He said, “Same job, we will switch you.</span> <span id="s881">You going am -- federal civil service.”</span> <span id="s882">And he got his [indecipherable] out of it.</span> <span id="s883">So it’s -- overnight, she was making three times as much money, but unfortunately, my job was seen to a different location, and she had to quit that job, go with me.</span> <span id="s884">And that’s what she needed a citizenship for.</span> <span id="s885">They knew all -- they knew all that in advance, that might change and that -- and that -- and if we had children there was still something else.</span> <span id="s886">But -- so, we came back to Heidelberg, and we -- we live in government housing, and I got changed to another city in Germany, and became the liaison officer to the German CIA, for the army, and there -- I’m going to speak about some other interesting things.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q: Okay, let’s switch the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s889">Q: This is tape number three, side A, of an interview with Eddie Willner.</span> <span id="s890">Oh yeah, you can start with --</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A: No, I going to start here.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A: Okay, I’m sorry we -- I’m -- should have had part of my story before, and not now, and -- to be in the proper order of sequence.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Q: It doesn’t matter.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">A: It doesn’t matter?</span> <span id="s896">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Q: No, cause we put --</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: Okay, we go back to Brussels, where I went after the war and stayed --</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: And at that time, I was all by myself, and I went to Jewish organizations for help, and I was very lucky.</span> <span id="s901">I was considered an orphan, but here was a 19 year old orphan.</span> <span id="s902">You don’t put an orphan of that age in an orphanage.</span> <span id="s903">But the head of the Jewish organization -- there was the HIAS, and the Joint Committee, the head to -- was -- not the overhead, but one of the heads was a Mr. Muntzbah, who was in the internment camp in France with my father, and I knew him, and he survived the war, and became an official in one of these organizations.</span> <span id="s904">And when I went to see him one day, he said look -- I didn’t have a place to stay, I stayed temporarily with some people -- and I also [indecipherable] the Dutch people I stayed with.</span> <span id="s905">He said to me, "Well, we have an orphanage here of children who were -- who were in -- hidden by Belgians during the war, but whose parents went to the concentration camps, and then the orphanage still we’ve -- have a place for them [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s906">So, I know they can find a place for you, but you will not be part of the orphanage except for sp -- sleeping purposes.</span> <span id="s907">You can go after a career, or back to school, whatever you,” -- but they couldn’t help me.</span> <span id="s908">So I said, “Okay, I’ll take the room.”</span> <span id="s909">They gave me a room under a roof, very nice.</span> <span id="s910">I went back to visit it two years ago with my second son, my wife with me.</span> <span id="s911">So I was in an orphanage, and I was free to go, and I -- it was arranged for me to -- they say, what do you want to learn to be?</span> <span id="s912">What do you want to be?</span> <span id="s913">Well, I had no idea, and they had -- some Jewish organization had the place to become a mechanic or something.</span> <span id="s914">And there were [indecipherable] people go to Israel.</span> <span id="s915">And I went in there and I went to school, and then I found a photographer there, who was a -- the court photographer for Belgium some.</span> <span id="s916">He had a very big studio on a main street in Brussels, very fancy, very rich.</span> <span id="s917">And I was inter -- always interested photography, and he was a Russian Jew who had lived in Belgium most of his life, who was involved in un -- during World War two, in a spy group, working against the Germans, that operated in France, and in Belgium.</span> <span id="s918">And there’s several books written on this spying group, called the Red Orchestra.</span> <span id="s919">The German Intelligence, the Gestapo call it the Red Orchestra.</span> <span id="s920">But most of the members of the Red Orchestra were Jews, and so had been my boss, the photographer.</span> <span id="s921">So he was very well known, and because of -- not [indecipherable] because he was photographer, and he did take portraits, mainly.</span> <span id="s922">So I wanted to work in the lab, and I think he had two labs, one was for his real business, the other one probably for some other business.</span> <span id="s923">He and I got along fine, but in the meantime was being re-interviewed by Jewish organizations, and they kept asking me about going to Israel.</span> <span id="s924">These were American organizations, some of them are Israeli, or pa -- or Palestinian.</span> <span id="s925">And they continuously tried to tell me I should go to Israel.</span> <span id="s926">I didn’t have a job, I didn’t have a profession, I didn’t have anything.</span> <span id="s927">But I was healthy, I was a body, and they needed bodies there.</span> <span id="s928">So, on one of the interviews, this Jewish interviewer said to me, “Well, you know, with your age, and your experience, having come out alive from the concentration camps, and being healthy, intelligent, and whatever like that, right now learn to be a mechanic for photog -- photographer.</span> <span id="s929">These are the type [indecipherable] in Israel.”</span> <span id="s930">I said, “Well, I agree.”</span> <span id="s931">He said, “How about you?”</span> <span id="s932">I said, “I don’t like me.</span> <span id="s933">I have no interest in Israel.</span> <span id="s934">I have sympathy for the Jews that found a new home there, who came like me, out of the camps, but to me it’s too much sand.”</span> <span id="s935">I -- I needed to say something, why I wa -- that was really -- I -- I needed -- I don’t like hot climates, that’s one reason.</span> <span id="s936">There were a number of things, and also it was not -- how should I say?</span> <span id="s937">Fancy, like going to the United States.</span> <span id="s938">This was a country developing, that didn’t have their statehood yet.</span> <span id="s939">Everything was new, and it was going -- like going to military again in -- first, also.</span> <span id="s940">And -- and the United States appealing to me -- they did, because liberated by them.</span> <span id="s941">I ge -- I liked the guys.</span> <span id="s942">You asked me that before, why I liked them, and so all this and more appealed to me.</span> <span id="s943">And I was a western European, this was the Middle East to me, and -- and -- and in one of the answers the guy said to me -- oh, I said -- why do you not [indecipherable] I said, “Well, too much sand, and too many Arabs.</span> <span id="s944">I don’t like hot climate.”</span> <span id="s945">And he -- he looked at me, and I thought I had to say something, and I said, for a joke, “And too many Jews.”</span> <span id="s946">And I thought at that moment the guy was going to throw me out of the office.</span> <span id="s947">But I -- I meant it as a joke.</span> <span id="s948">But too hot, and too much sand, that was one of the things I really meant.</span> <span id="s949">In short, I wasn’t interested in going to Israel, but he tried to push me.</span> <span id="s950">I’m glad I didn’t go, and -- but -- but th-the worst thing I did was when he asked me, “What are you going to do then?”</span> <span id="s951">So I said, “Well, I -- I try to go to the United States.”</span> <span id="s952">I told you that once before.</span> <span id="s953">“Well, have you got paper?”</span> <span id="s954">“No,” I said, “I’m trying to get paper.”</span> <span id="s955">And -- “From whom?”</span> <span id="s956">I said, “I located a cousin of my father.”</span> <span id="s957">Apparently he is -- he was rich, because he had to have some money to sponsor somebody, and everybody at the time tried to go the United States, not just Jews, eastern Europeans who didn’t want to go back to Poland, or somewhere.</span> <span id="s958">And he said, “Suppose you don’t get the paper to go?</span> <span id="s959">What are you going to do then?”</span> <span id="s960">Well, I thought about staying in Brussels.</span> <span id="s961">I also had a quite nice girlfriend, and -- was 12 years older than myself, a teacher, but that wasn’t the main reason.</span> <span id="s962">I still wanted to go United States, and make a new life for myself.</span> <span id="s963">And I already had tasted American life with the young men I was with in Germany.</span> <span id="s964">They had a big influence, really, on me.</span> <span id="s965">Clean cut guys who already knew something about war, and had traveled, and seen Europe, an-and a lot of other thing.</span> <span id="s966">Well, United States [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s967">So, when the guy said, “Suppose you don’t get your papers?”</span> <span id="s968">Well, I said -- he was -- he was [indecipherable] “I’ll go back to Germany.”</span> <span id="s969">And I said back to Germany, because that’s where I came from, where I knew a lot of people, my parents had friends who were not Jewish.</span> <span id="s970">And when I said go on back to Germany, he said, “How can you go back to Germany?</span> <span id="s971">The land did this for you.”</span> <span id="s972">I said, “The land that some people did to me and my par -- my family.”</span> <span id="s973">Well, we disagreed, and again, like I said, he was going to then throw me out for sure, but he didn’t.</span> <span id="s974">And I was serious, but today I would say I would have made a mistake, because for a Jew to live in Germany, like I said before, it’s different than living, a Jew, here.</span> <span id="s975">I would take real offense if I heard them all Nazi talk, and I have, in the military, on the -- being American uniform, and understanding German, I overheard many things that people said, in outdoor café, or what -- someplace.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q: What did you hear?</span></p> <p><span id="s977">A: Anti-Semitic statements.</span> <span id="s978">Nothing out of the ordinary.</span> <span id="s979">Anti-Israel.</span> <span id="s980">And for that matter, I want to add this here, about German, and the talk I gave in high school about the Holocaust, that these people, like the SS, who did this [indecipherable] exist anywhere.</span> <span id="s981">In peacetime they become criminals because they shoot somebody, beat somebody to death.</span> <span id="s982">In wartime they get away with it.</span> <span id="s983">They kill an enemy.</span> <span id="s984">So the people that did this in Germany, the same people we have in United States, too, only we have a different government, democratic government, and for that matter, I think we have them in Israel, too.</span> <span id="s985">I am sure that Jews who could kill Arabs, just because they’re Arabs, who hate them, and Arabs who just can hate -- kill Jews, because they’re Jews.</span> <span id="s986">Unfortunately, that’s the way the world is.</span> <span id="s987">I think you have to be realistic about that.</span> <span id="s988">Hatred has always existed, will continue to exist, and as far as I am concerned -- like I said before, it can tear you apart.</span> <span id="s989">It’s not good to hate.</span> <span id="s990">It [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s991">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">A: Okay, I was interviewed for Palestine, too.</span> <span id="s993">Okay, start?</span> <span id="s994">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">A: Okay, one of the nicer things about going to United States, and waiting for papers, was first when I found a sponsor.</span> <span id="s996">Was a distant relative of mine, cousin of my father, I had never met before.</span> <span id="s997">But he turned out to be a rich man, but not very generous, because I came to United States with 10 dollars in my pocket, he did not pay -- want to pay for my ticket on the ship, which would have been about a hundred dollars, or so.</span> <span id="s998">So I went in person to his home in New London, Connecticut.</span> <span id="s999">I thanked him, and send him every year, for Rosh Hashanah, a card.</span> <span id="s1000">But he didn’t answer.</span> <span id="s1001">He really didn’t want any responsibilities.</span> <span id="s1002">I felt -- I felt, I didn’t say so, but I -- that if I -- this -- I had been in his place, and a young boy comes over, missed out on a cation, has nobody, I send him back to school, maybe -- possibly through college, and if he want to [indecipherable] his money back for college, say, “Look, you can pay me back when you can.”</span> <span id="s1003">But he -- this was not the case, and there was also one of the reasons why I went into U.S. army.</span> <span id="s1004">I want to be on my own, and as it turned out, I don’t have to have to say thank you to anybody.</span> <span id="s1005">I just did it on myself, I wasn’t dependent on anybody.</span> <span id="s1006">But one other lucky thing happened in Bozdoltz when I was sitting in a -- a sidewalk café, having a cup of coffee, was an American sitting next to me, next table.</span> <span id="s1007">He couldn’t speak French, and I helped him along, asking the waiter some questions.</span> <span id="s1008">He turned out to be a big businessman from New York, and he involved me in a conversation, and then I told him I waiting to go United States, and he said, “What are you going to do there?”</span> <span id="s1009">He offered me a job in his import export business.</span> <span id="s1010">He owned -- also owned a zipper factory in New York.</span> <span id="s1011">And he said, “Well, when you get to y -- New York, come and see me, maybe I have a job for you.”</span> <span id="s1012">It turned out he did have a job for me, and I learned production of zippers, and I worked in -- he really wanted to employ me in his import export business, because I spoke language.</span> <span id="s1013">I didn’t tell him I was going to go to the army.</span> <span id="s1014">I would have been drafted anyway, there was still a draft on at the time, and I would have had to serve two years.</span> <span id="s1015">So he lost me anyway.</span> <span id="s1016">So instead, I enlisted in the U.S. army for three years, whereas a draft would have been for two years, something like that.</span> <span id="s1017">This afforded me an opportunity to get a high school diploma, and -- which I did all while working as a soldier, training and so on.</span> <span id="s1018">And I -- from the time I applied, to the time I started with the U.S. army were about three months.</span> <span id="s1019">I went to Fort Dix, New Jersey for basic training, and stayed there four months, and then this incident happened with this colonel, I think I might have told that story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">Q: You didn’t tell it on tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">A: I didn’t tell on tape?</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">A: Well, I was chosen from my battalion, wh-which was at a strength of about seven to 800 men, I was chosen the soldier of the month, that meant being a good soldier, and doing things right, and handling weapons all right, and going to study certain items, or things, that the army needed.</span> <span id="s1024">Basically what a young soldier does who first comes in the army, nothing special.</span> <span id="s1025">Well, out of this, based on the points you win, through the months, I got the highest points, and was named soldier of the month.</span> <span id="s1026">That meant having the honor of sitting in the colonel’s office, on Saturday morning when there was no training, and answering his telephone, on -- on the -- on his -- yeah, outside -- sit -- sitting outside the colonel’s office, with the adjutant, who was a captain.</span> <span id="s1027">At that time the colonel was reading the New York Times, and all of a sudden, very loud he said, when he read the headlines in the New York Times, which said Israel a state, United Nations has voted to welcome Israel into the nations of the free world, or -- and the colonel said to himself, or maybe so everybody could hear it in the office, “Goddamn Jew politics.”</span> <span id="s1028">Well, the adjutant knew that I was Jewish, the colonel didn’t.</span> <span id="s1029">He wasn’t very much interested in the soldier of the month.</span> <span id="s1030">To him it was just another soldier answering telephone -- although I did get a certificate from him for that.</span> <span id="s1031">And he -- I -- I wasn’t sure how I was going to respond to that, he didn’t say this to -- to me, just to himself, expressed something real loud in the office, and I walked out, and I wasn’t going to have the honor of sitting in this man’s outer office.</span> <span id="s1032">The adjutant came after me, he knew what I was doing, and he knew that I’d understood what the colonel had said.</span> <span id="s1033">He was very embarrassed, and he asked me to please come back.</span> <span id="s1034">He didn’t want to make a big issue out of this.</span> <span id="s1035">I said, “No, I just came here to the United States, and I admire the freedoms we have here, also freedom of expression, but -- but not improper things like -- like that.”</span> <span id="s1036">So he underst -- said he understands, but it wasn’t his opinion, and no -- he didn’t think anybody else in the office, just the colonel’s opinion.</span> <span id="s1037">Well, I said I can understand, everybody’s entitled to his opinion, but not in a position like he is, make a blanket statement like that.</span> <span id="s1038">So, the final thing was that I did not go back to the office, and in leaving him, he said, “Willner, remember for the rest of your career, that all kinds of people make this world.”</span> <span id="s1039">And I just remember that sometimes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">Q: Did you ever experience any -- did -- repercussions?</span> <span id="s1041">You were saying a little earlier that -- that the adjutant was concerned that you were going to be maybe demoted, or something, because you had left the office.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">A: I -- I -- I really, at that time, could care less.</span> <span id="s1043">I mean, I didn’t -- I -- I -- I didn’t think of that I’m afraid of being -- I don’t think that could have happened to me, knowing already what I knew about the U.S. army, that everybody’s pretty much the same, and people are people, there are good ones and bad ones.</span> <span id="s1044">There’s always a rotten apple somewhere.</span> <span id="s1045">But there also good apples on top.</span> <span id="s1046">So, it didn’t bother me.</span> <span id="s1047">Particularly, I was very con -- not concerned, but aware of the freedom that people had here, and this was part of it.</span> <span id="s1048">When I finished that basic training, was a battalion at Fort Dix, my luck started.</span> <span id="s1049">The whole battalion was ordered to Alaska, about 700 men or so, and I was in despair.</span> <span id="s1050">I thought if I’m going to be in the army, I’m going to use my language background, French or German, or both, but what about Alaska?</span> <span id="s1051">Besides it’s very cold there.</span> <span id="s1052">So from my viewpoint, I also had to consider -- which I always considered, giving back something to this country, and I was debating with myself, well maybe I should go to Alaska, like everybody else, but again here’s free speech, I can open my mouth and say I’m better fit for Germany, or France.</span> <span id="s1053">I can do the army more good, and perform better than being a soldier.</span> <span id="s1054">Many soldiers better than I am, they can shoot better, and do this better, that better.</span> <span id="s1055">And I decided, no, I should not keep my mouth shut.</span> <span id="s1056">And particularly I thought perhaps, being soldier of the month, maybe somebody remembers me, and they will talk to me, because not normally down in the army that you go and complain [indecipherable] with reason.</span> <span id="s1057">So I went to see another officer who was in personnel, and I said what I’m -- I’m -- I’m not norm -- not normally in the habit of making complaints, this not a complaint, a suggestion, I would appreciate look into this.</span> <span id="s1058">That -- that [indecipherable], as you know, I said, the battalion, infantry battalion is going to Alaska, and I feel that I’m wasting my time, and I’m wasting the army’s time by just being a soldier.</span> <span id="s1059">The only thing he has to know maybe, to fire some weapon, and I can do that, but I can do much more if I’m in a position in -- in Europe someplace.</span> <span id="s1060">So the United States at that time was all over Europe, except in the east.</span> <span id="s1061">And so, make the long story short, he didn’t say yes or no, but he said, “You’ll be notified.”</span> <span id="s1062">I was n-notified the next day that I’m taken off the orders.</span> <span id="s1063">So that was the first day, it didn’t say I was going to Germany, but then I went around, I was excited.</span> <span id="s1064">I went, asked some people, some -- most people didn’t know, but then I came up on the sergeant who said, “Yeah, I’ve seen your name.</span> <span id="s1065">I think you’re going to Germany.”</span> <span id="s1066">Well, I -- I was hoping he was right, and it was true.</span> <span id="s1067">I went to Germany, and on the ship to transport were some other foreign-born people, also in the army, mostly Polish, or Czechs, in total about 10.</span> <span id="s1068">And when we arrived in Germany, in Bremerhaven, the security people came on board, and they said, “You, you, and you, and you.</span> <span id="s1069">You remain here.”</span> <span id="s1070">There was myself included, another guy from [indecipherable] Germany, and about seven or eight Poles, and one or two Czechs.</span> <span id="s1071">And what this was, they were hunting spies.</span> <span id="s1072">The -- the [indecipherable] Intelligence had gotten information that some of the people who claimed to be refugees from the east, were not -- were from the east, but were not refugees, they pretended to be.</span> <span id="s1073">They want to get into United States, and spy for Russia, or Poland.</span> <span id="s1074">But they check everybody out then, including myself.</span> <span id="s1075">Anybody was fa -- I forgot to say, I was not a citizen at the time.</span> <span id="s1076">And everybody -- oh -- oh -- amo -- among these 10 men, didn’t have American citizenship.</span> <span id="s1077">The regulation at that time was that anybody who immigrate to United States, who comes in, and is of draft age, will serve in the army first.</span> <span id="s1078">This for all the people who signed papers that they come for permanent residence to United States -- not if you’re visiting here, you -- and you’ve given up your citizenship.</span> <span id="s1079">I never reclaimed my German citizenship, which I could have.</span> <span id="s1080">I can go today the German embassy and say, “Under Hitler I was deprived of a German citizenship, I want it back.”</span> <span id="s1081">I could have it.</span> <span id="s1082">I know somebody that did that here.</span> <span id="s1083">I have no interest in that.</span> <span id="s1084">They can keep their citizenship after all that.</span> <span id="s1085">So -- so we were held in Marmuk, Germany, we came in Bremerhaven port, then went by train to Marmuk, Germany.</span> <span id="s1086">It’s an old German castle.</span> <span id="s1087">There were no fences or anything again.</span> <span id="s1088">Not as a prisoner, but just a place to live.</span> <span id="s1089">And they told us they have to investigate each one of us, and clear us to go to our new assignment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">Q: What year was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">A: This was in 1948.</span> <span id="s1092">I didn’t think, frankly, that six -- seven months, or eight months after immigrate to United States, I would be back where I came from.</span> <span id="s1093">Never in my wildest dreams I would have thought -- it wouldn’t have happened if I would have gone to Alaska, and I thought I’d go to Alaska, or go the Far East or something.</span> <span id="s1094">But -- so I opened my mouth, and I learned my first lesson, you want to get something done, don’t complain about it, go and talk to the right people.</span> <span id="s1095">Maybe you’ll get a no, like people are re-religious, who think about praying to God, to give them this or that, or -- and then it doesn’t happen.</span> <span id="s1096">Or like a rabbi once said, here in the military, “Well, God is hearing you, but he just said no.”</span> <span id="s1097">Well, that’s the way I felt about some of these things, so they say no, say no, but at least I try.</span> <span id="s1098">I don’t know if you see that little saying on the wall, I’ve had for 25 years.</span> <span id="s1099">Failures [indecipherable] people are failures.</span> <span id="s1100">Failures are people who thi -- who thought -- I’m n -- y -- all mixed up now -- who thought and never did.</span> <span id="s1101">Number [indecipherable] plan yama, but if you don’t do anything, you know, nothing’s going to happen, or you complain about somebody if you don’t complain about -- you go into a store, and you have something to complain about the merchandise, or the sales lady, well don’t talk to her, talk to her supervisor, or to the manager of the place.</span> <span id="s1102">Get something corrected.</span> <span id="s1103">So my saying is failures are divided into two classes, those who did and never thought, and those who thought and never did.</span> <span id="s1104">You thinking about a plan of something [indecipherable] or you do it, otherwise you might as well be talking to the wall.</span> <span id="s1105">And also [indecipherable] you doing something, to think about it first.</span> <span id="s1106">I have buil -- built many things which I thought were -- help m -- help me in my sickness, or whatever, and to -- in order to get my shoes on better.</span> <span id="s1107">It’s harder to get myself dressed, and I’ve become very inventive.</span> <span id="s1108">The moment I think about something, I start doing it already.</span> <span id="s1109">But a lot of things I’ve done, just sitting in a corner, they’re useless.</span> <span id="s1110">But I did them, so it was fun doing them, and the idea to do this, and I pass on the ideas to other people, who were able to help themselves [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1111">So -- and finally -- it was about 10 days later, after sitting in [indecipherable], only two people were released to go to their destination, myself and another guy.</span> <span id="s1112">And all the Poles were kept, because they were pretty sure, they just didn’t know who, that there were spies being infiltrated into the U.S. army in Europe.</span> <span id="s1113">Okay, that was the start of the Cold War, let’s say, and -- but it was true, there were people who were being infiltrated.</span> <span id="s1114">It was a good chance for them to do that.</span> <span id="s1115">And to -- there was specifically a case -- not one case, 5,000 people, they called it the Lodge act.</span> <span id="s1116">Lodge was a senator, and he had a law passed that said there are many people in Europe, or in Germany, particularly, who came originally from East Bloc countries, from Poland and Russia maybe, Czechoslovakia, who cannot go back, because they are not Communists, or for other reasons, whatever.</span> <span id="s1117">Some unfortunately, because they’re war criminals.</span> <span id="s1118">And he said, “We have to do something, we employing these people.”</span> <span id="s1119">The U.S. army was employing them as auxiliary guards.</span> <span id="s1120">They had the regular uniform that GIs wore, but it was dyed black.</span> <span id="s1121">No insignia.</span> <span id="s1122">And they wore rifle at night, and they stood guard around these places, where there were American soldiers housed.</span> <span id="s1123">And these people, probably some of them were on the Nazi side [indecipherable] because they lost the war, not on the American side.</span> <span id="s1124">But the Lodge act said we give them a chance for new future, and they don’t have any dependents, they must be unmarried.</span> <span id="s1125">We accept 5,000 of these people, who are already working for us, in the -- End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">A: -- he was a army Intelligence school at Owamagow, Germany.</span> <span id="s1127">That’s where they have the Passion play, you may have heard about that.</span> <span id="s1128">And the school had two courses, and I was picked for the criminal investigator’s course.</span> <span id="s1129">What is this, being a de-de-detective in the army.</span> <span id="s1130">Which is nice, because you don’t have to wear a uniform, you go out in civilian clothes.</span> <span id="s1131">So you’re a soldier, I fig-figure for tho -- for two years, and you have a ID that you are a -- a detective, or a criminal investigator in this case [indecipherable], and you have many privileges, including most of the officer’s normally have.</span> <span id="s1132">Here I was only a private, or a corporal, and I applied for it, and the captain called me in, and he said, “Well, I don’t think you are qualified.”</span> <span id="s1133">I said, “Why not, sir?”</span> <span id="s1134">“You’re too short.”</span> <span id="s1135">I said, “Captain, have you ever heard of exceptions?”</span> <span id="s1136">I thought he was a guy who would cat -- not ask please do this, or do that, or -- I -- I was showing him that I knew what was on.</span> <span id="s1137">He said, “Yeah, well wh-what do -- exception would you have?”</span> <span id="s1138">“An exception for height.”</span> <span id="s1139">I know that the minimum is five foot in o -- in -- in officer’s school the same thing, but they give a -- a exception.</span> <span id="s1140">He said, “And your English is not that good.”</span> <span id="s1141">I said, “That’s true, but I can learn very fast.”</span> <span id="s1142">And [indecipherable] he didn’t want to let me go to school.</span> <span id="s1143">So at that time, I had this civilian friend, a lady, who was a girlfriend of a colonel, who was higher than the captain, she told him my story, and that the captain had refused let me go to school.</span> <span id="s1144">And this girl called this captain and said, “Why don’t you let Willner go to school?”</span> <span id="s1145">He had some stupid reasons.</span> <span id="s1146">He himself was a stupid man, and so the colonel said, “Well I -- I think he is very capable, and I think you should consider him.”</span> <span id="s1147">He couldn’t tell him what to do, but captains don’t fool around with colonels.</span> <span id="s1148">And so next thing I know was an orders to come investigator’s school.</span> <span id="s1149">Very interesting, in the mountains, beautiful, and I became a criminal investigator and they teach you all the things a detective learns.</span> <span id="s1150">But you deal only with army members, or air force, or navy.</span> <span id="s1151">And -- so when I finished that, I was assigned to Heidelberg, which is the headquarters for yu -- all U.S. forces in Europe.</span> <span id="s1152">And in Heidelberg -- it -- it’s the headquarters where there’s staff officers.</span> <span id="s1153">Well I wasn’t going to be a staff officer, because first of all I wasn’t an officer.</span> <span id="s1154">Number two, that’s -- you have to know good knowledge of the English language, you had to write reports, staff studies, that wasn’t for me, I knew that.</span> <span id="s1155">So I didn’t turn out -- I’m going to the right school, and -- well, in Heidelberg.</span> <span id="s1156">Our captain, the commander, was a Jewish guy by the name of Marcus.</span> <span id="s1157">He was a lawyer in civilian life, and he was being -- he had been drafted for the army, and he became the commander of the investigation unit.</span> <span id="s1158">So he was very good.</span> <span id="s1159">And -- and then he ha -- assigned me to an en -- to a guy who also was Jewish, who had been a police force in Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s1160">And he was a champion boxer there.</span> <span id="s1161">Big guy name of Goldstein.</span> <span id="s1162">And they assigned me to him as his partner.</span> <span id="s1163">Now in police work you usually will partnership with a policeman that’s already well into it, and Goldstein was not only former policeman, he was big, strong, a bully of a guy, who if you -- he talked to you, pay -- you pay attention.</span> <span id="s1164">He was a nice person, too.</span> <span id="s1165">He had himself been a captain, but he was demoted to captain after World War two, because they made many people officers, and after World War two --</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">Q: Excuse me --</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">A: -- it was common that a lot of officers, who made more money being officers in the army than civilian life, wanted to stay in the army as a career, but they couldn’t use everybody on staff, there was too many people.</span> <span id="s1168">They were losing the forces, and he was rift.</span> <span id="s1169">And then they had a deal, when people were rift, could re-enlist in the army, but not as officers, as master sergeant.</span> <span id="s1170">That’s a ter-ter-terrible come-down.</span> <span id="s1171">You -- that’s not a proper thing to do in proper management in my opinion, to have people moted up, and then they go down again.</span> <span id="s1172">But again, that was our system, and when I knew him was a captain, and I was a corporal, so Captain Marcus said, “You go as -- w -- Goldstein.”</span> <span id="s1173">And it turned out to be terrific experience, he turned out to be a terrific guy.</span> <span id="s1174">He was very good investigator, he was very good with criminals.</span> <span id="s1175">Good interrogator.</span> <span id="s1176">I really learned a lot.</span> <span id="s1177">As a matter of fact, he was very courageous guy, and he treated me like -- he taught me thing, and I was very grateful for that.</span> <span id="s1178">And th -- and then he got into trouble.</span> <span id="s1179">He was honest, but he had an affair with a German professor’s wife.</span> <span id="s1180">[indecipherable] been invited the house -- and the German professor was not a Nazi or nothing, nothing to do with, strictly -- so Goldstein did that, and then she was going to divorce him, and marry Goldstein.</span> <span id="s1181">And she did, finally.</span> <span id="s1182">I saw them one time in the States.</span> <span id="s1183">Okay, those things happened there, but -- okay, I working with Goldstein, and -- interesting cases.</span> <span id="s1184">And -- for instance, a guy [indecipherable] from Heidelberg all of a sudden, came like -- w -- from Paris came a request, they want Heidelberg to send an investigator to Paris that spoke both German and French.</span> <span id="s1185">German, because he had to operate in a French zone in Germany, and the American zone, you had to know German.</span> <span id="s1186">Not all investigators spoke four language.</span> <span id="s1187">There was one thing, and the second thing was that he -- yeah, that he spoke French also fluently, and work with the French police in the past.</span> <span id="s1188">I thought that was great.</span> <span id="s1189">So I went to Paris.</span> <span id="s1190">I bought my first car, I bought a surplus Jeep from the army.</span> <span id="s1191">One thing, but I didn’t have any money.</span> <span id="s1192">400 bucks that I pay for that thing.</span> <span id="s1193">Lot of money in those days.</span> <span id="s1194">And I put my dog in it -- I always had German Shepherd -- and baggage, and I came to the French border, and the Frenchman said, “What -- what do you have in there?”</span> <span id="s1195">Gasoline, I had four extra cans of gas, because gasoline was expensive in those days.</span> <span id="s1196">You had to buy German, but we were entitled to American gas [indecipherable], and I had four jerry cans full.</span> <span id="s1197">And the French customs officer, “What’s in there?”</span> <span id="s1198">He knew what was in there, gas.</span> <span id="s1199">“You cannot import any gas to France.”</span> <span id="s1200">I said, “It’s my gas, not for sale, and selling on black market.</span> <span id="s1201">I have to report to Paris, and I just bought this Jeep, and I was told that it was difficult to get gas, and also more expensive.</span> <span id="s1202">So I took four [indecipherable].”</span> <span id="s1203">You know, you cannot take [indecipherable].”</span> <span id="s1204">That was just plain harassment.</span> <span id="s1205">They were jealous.</span> <span id="s1206">Then I said, “Will you give me a statement that you don’t let military allies -- that you won’t let me cross the border with four cans of gas?</span> <span id="s1207">What big deal is this, four cans of gas?”</span> <span id="s1208">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1209">He said yeah.</span> <span id="s1210">Also, they -- he wanted me to leave it there for him to sell Black Market, they were [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1211">So I -- I got upset, and I drove my car to a ditch.</span> <span id="s1212">He said, “What are you driving it there for?”</span> <span id="s1213">I said, “I’m making phone call, telephone there.”</span> <span id="s1214">But I went to the ditch, I took my four cans of gas, and I poured them into the ditch.</span> <span id="s1215">I filled my gas tank first, one more time.</span> <span id="s1216">And the French came up, “Ah, if somebody throws a -- throw the match down there, and going to be fire,” and all this.</span> <span id="s1217">But I was really upset, and th -- this guy, he got upset.</span> <span id="s1218">That’s what I wanted.</span> <span id="s1219">I wasn’t going to leave those four cans there.</span> <span id="s1220">I made it to Paris, but I might as well not have made it.</span> <span id="s1221">20 miles out of Paris, I was looking at my gauge, and was at the end [indecipherable], if worse comes to worse, I would have gotten the French gas, but my car start to be on fire.</span> <span id="s1222">I don’t know, I’m not a mechanic, I don’t know anything.</span> <span id="s1223">I’m not interested in mechanics.</span> <span id="s1224">I -- I -- I know my car’s out of gas, or little -- couple little things.</span> <span id="s1225">My wife the same way, my old son the same way, and he should know about mechanics in helicopters.</span> <span id="s1226">Well, it started burning, and I thought I had a fire extinguisher, couldn’t find it.</span> <span id="s1227">I said, “Let the he -- damn thing burn, I want to get to Paris.”</span> <span id="s1228">40 more miles I hitchhiked, but I figured, with the dog, it’s going to be difficult, German Shepherd.</span> <span id="s1229">But I get picked up, and some drove me into Paris.</span> <span id="s1230">Not only drove me to Paris, but drove me to the place I was supposed to go.</span> <span id="s1231">So okay, that’s that.</span> <span id="s1232">In Paris I had my greatest time.</span> <span id="s1233">I figured I can pick up on my education, and the army is going to pay for it.</span> <span id="s1234">They encouraged that, they -- and the GI bill, and I was assigned to the French FBI [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1235">They had several [indecipherable], and I wound up with a very nice inspector, who taught me all [indecipherable] thing.</span> <span id="s1236">Basically, the job was, if an American did something wrong in Paris, the French arrested him, and then they didn’t know what to do with him.</span> <span id="s1237">They turned him over to the Americans.</span> <span id="s1238">So they decided to have somebody permanently up there -- not always, call somebody someplace.</span> <span id="s1239">And got the job, and I -- they paid for a room, the army paid for nice hotel room in a [indecipherable] from the Arc of Triumph, and the owner of the hotel -- hotel, liked my dog.</span> <span id="s1240">I was all fixed up.</span> <span id="s1241">So I lived in there for -- short of a year, and I had interesting experience, I was -- I’ll just mention one, or two.</span> <span id="s1242">A -- they had phony money circulating then.</span> <span id="s1243">This -- these were not phony dollars, but the occupation money, they call it scrip.</span> <span id="s1244">Scrip was money that the Black Market was done with.</span> <span id="s1245">You would go in the PX, and buy things with it [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1246">And [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">Q: Your job -- your job lasted a year.</span> <span id="s1248">What -- will you describe more specifically what your job was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">A: My job [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1250">As a criminal investigator, criminal investigations within the army.</span> <span id="s1251">Somebody murdered somebody in the army, and somebody stole, raided the supply room, sold on the Black Market.</span> <span id="s1252">Some people got involved in drugs, phony money being printed by the French in southern France.</span> <span id="s1253">Everything, like -- yeah.</span> <span id="s1254">And I -- even including homosexual, which was not normal that time.</span> <span id="s1255">My boss asked me one time if I had been in England.</span> <span id="s1256">I said no.</span> <span id="s1257">“Want to take a quick trip to England, just across channel?”</span> <span id="s1258">“Yeah, what is it?”</span> <span id="s1259">“Well, we have a guy, the English arrested a guy, a Black man, who is a homosexual.”</span> <span id="s1260">And the English [indecipherable] people know about the English.</span> <span id="s1261">At one time Britain was known for homosexuality.</span> <span id="s1262">The men -- n-nice people, well-known people.</span> <span id="s1263">And he said, “Well, the guy is a homosexual.</span> <span id="s1264">He is not dangerous, he is not commit any other crimes, but [indecipherable] been arrested, he can’t turn loose again, he must be escorted back to his base.”</span> <span id="s1265">I said, “Do I have to wear a weapon?”</span> <span id="s1266">I figured I might fall asleep, it might grab my weapon.</span> <span id="s1267">He said, “That’s required of you, but you wear it underneath your jacket, concealed.”</span> <span id="s1268">I said, “Okay.”</span> <span id="s1269">I went to London, and picked up the guy, and he was a Black sergeant and he -- very intelligent.</span> <span id="s1270">He was obviously homosexual, but that was not -- not my problem, and he -- I got curious, the guy was intelligent, talkative.</span> <span id="s1271">I never handled a homosexual.</span> <span id="s1272">I had one as a friend one time, and -- in the army.</span> <span id="s1273">I di -- I di -- know he was homosexual.</span> <span id="s1274">It didn’t bother me, but -- but some people criticized me for it.</span> <span id="s1275">I figure what I can do ma -- in my own bedroom, nobody’s business.</span> <span id="s1276">I ran away and I [indecipherable] good.</span> <span id="s1277">I had a interview with the CIA when I retired from the army, and the CIA questions you, and puts you on a lie detector, polygraph test.</span> <span id="s1278">I answered everything truthfully, til they got to my sex life.</span> <span id="s1279">And the guy on the polygraph said, “You went out a lot?”</span> <span id="s1280">“Yeah.”</span> <span id="s1281">This nothing held against you.</span> <span id="s1282">They rather have somebody that he’s been around, knows what’s going on than somebody who is shy, and timid, you know?</span> <span id="s1283">But some -- they had to ask [indecipherable] question.</span> <span id="s1284">So, I was sitting across this guy on a train coming back from London, and, “Excuse me, I -- you seem to be a pretty nice guy, and -- and in some places it’s not considered a crime, but I’m new in this.</span> <span id="s1285">Can you tell me please, if you want to talk, why are you a homosexual?</span> <span id="s1286">You look nice, and --,” He said, “Well sir, we walked here and you see a good looking woman come out in the street, you -- make you excited, you may get -- you -- you look, and that’s basically the same thing when I see a man.”</span> <span id="s1287">That’s a -- that’s all he said.</span> <span id="s1288">A nice guy, I didn’t think [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">Q: So how did you feel about the army’s policy, or asking you to arrest this man for being homosexual?</span> <span id="s1290">A: I didn’t arrest him, I escorted him.</span> <span id="s1291">I’m ne -- my -- my arrests were in different [indecipherable] Nazis, which we were not supposed to arrest, but I did [indecipherable] people [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">Q: One more question before you move on.</span> <span id="s1293">So you were just saying some -- something about the polygraph test, did you finish that thought?</span> <span id="s1294">A: They ask me, “How’s your sex life with your wife?”</span> <span id="s1295">See, it was okay if you said, “Well, I fool around, I have lot of girlfriend.”</span> <span id="s1296">They think you’re normal, but with a guy it was [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1297">I said to him, “Well, I tell you, I -- I s -- talk about everything, my life is an open book.</span> <span id="s1298">To my wife, too.</span> <span id="s1299">But it’s not just one of your damn business what goes on in my -- my se -- sex life with my wife.</span> <span id="s1300">If you ask me about a girlfriend, or somebody else, I could possibly answer.</span> <span id="s1301">But not about my wife.</span> <span id="s1302">It’s none of your business whether it’s good or bad.”</span> <span id="s1303">And I got up.</span> <span id="s1304">Oh no, he s -- he said, “This -- this -- this concludes the interview.”</span> <span id="s1305">Fine [indecipherable], but they -- they come out with some other thing, asking -- they -- they particularly interested in -- you recording this?</span> <span id="s1306">You are?</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">Q: There’s a problem, and I don’t know to which extent it’s true.</span> <span id="s1309">I’m -- I -- I -- I believe this could be true, that when you apply for a job in the CIA, or some other intelligence organizations, they don’t take you like before with j -- if you’re Jewish, because of Israel.</span> <span id="s1310">They think the Mossad is everywhere.</span> <span id="s1311">And they are very active.</span> <span id="s1312">I have never been approached, but I have been five time in Israel.</span> <span id="s1313">I [indecipherable] my business there, but when they start questioning, I -- I never got the question, and -- and they trusted me, because know my opinion.</span> <span id="s1314">And somewhere I might have told some of my bosses the incident that going to Israel with a guy who [indecipherable], and they thought, well, this guy’s okay, but -- but nevertheless, I’m sure there’s some who -- who think Jews have double s -- citizenship, and some of them do, some of the non-Jews do.</span> <span id="s1315">I met -- I met a Danish businessman in Germany.</span> <span id="s1316">He showed me two pass -- the American passport, the Danish passport.</span> <span id="s1317">He was not Jewish, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">Q: What is the incident that you just mentioned about going to Israel with somebody?</span> <span id="s1319">A: The -- Israel [indecipherable] somewhere.</span> <span id="s1320">I went with my wife, and my younger son.</span> <span id="s1321">And I wouldn’t have goin -- even going to Israel, wouldn’t have had the relative there, who even provided me with the money for the ticket.</span> <span id="s1322">I didn’t make too much money in the beginning, and when he asked me to come, I -- he gave me -- it was my uncle, he was a pu -- he was very -- he was in east -- stayed in Germany, my mother’s brother.</span> <span id="s1323">He was decorated during World War one, he’s the one with the saber story I told.</span> <span id="s1324">And he wanted to fight the Germans, because his mother got arrested and sent to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s1325">So the Palestin -- the Israelis didn’t take him, he was too old.</span> <span id="s1326">He had been a bachelor all his life.</span> <span id="s1327">He was a playboy, as a matter of fact, but nice guy.</span> <span id="s1328">He was my favorite uncle.</span> <span id="s1329">He didn’t care about money, or anything, but he liked to go to parties, and -- and a woman that was interested in him, 20 years younger, and was our do -- my doctor’s daughter.</span> <span id="s1330">And she want to marry him.</span> <span id="s1331">She was 20 years older than he was.</span> <span id="s1332">And I have picture of her sitting on his lap when she was 20, he was 40, at a party.</span> <span id="s1333">Well, he never married her, he went to Israel, because his first girlfriend, who was a nurse, who enlists in the army when he enlist in the army, and they -- and he was sent to Queest, to what’s that?</span> <span id="s1334">A ci -- the island Cyprus.</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">A: The Germans want to attack there, want to take Greece, and he was in British uniform, he was still a German citizen.</span> <span id="s1337">That’s excuse for [indecipherable] but he, you know, [indecipherable] uniform.</span> <span id="s1338">But he didn’t care, so the British said, “Well, since you speak German fluently, we have a special job for you.</span> <span id="s1339">We [indecipherable] landing [indecipherable] keep the Germans out [indecipherable] go on to Italy.”</span> <span id="s1340">And he said, “What do you want me to do?”</span> <span id="s1341">“We want you to parachute at night, in the [indecipherable].”</span> <span id="s1342">He had never jumped by para -- he was 50 years o -- oh, they didn’t take him to the army [indecipherable] were 50, I think.</span> <span id="s1343">50 is nothing [indecipherable] the army.</span> <span id="s1344">He said, “Okay.”</span> <span id="s1345">When he was in the aircraft ready to jump, there was a [indecipherable] the aircraft, and the pilot gets a little shaky, and he s -- he figures something’s happen -- ha -- something’s happened to the aircraft, that’s going to be more of a fire on it, and he said, “Jump.”</span> <span id="s1346">And my uncle didn’t know whether he was to jump because of the fire on the plane, or before he arrived at destination, because the pilot was [indecipherable] was the destination, and they were all taken prisoners by the German.</span> <span id="s1347">They fall off the plane.</span> <span id="s1348">So he had all these men, sent to German prison camp, including my uncle, and he -- this -- the -- the German commander under him, Wehrmacht commander, the army commander, not -- not a [indecipherable] person, knew that his house was already full of people [indecipherable] anyway.</span> <span id="s1349">He didn’t -- well, he got them in there, and the -- the commander was a [indecipherable] officer, and when he got to my uncle, he ask him, “You ever serve in German army?”</span> <span id="s1350">What he going to answer?</span> <span id="s1351">[indecipherable] he couldn’t prove it, you know.</span> <span id="s1352">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1353">He wanted to show he fought in the German army, and the British army, he was traitor.</span> <span id="s1354">He [indecipherable] some o -- someone -- he tried to find out who the Jews were, and I think he was given an order, he didn’t do this on his own, he was given an order to do that.</span> <span id="s1355">So he said, “All Jews step one step forward.”</span> <span id="s1356">They were all line up, and nobody step forward.</span> <span id="s1357">He said louder, “All Jews step one step forward.”</span> <span id="s1358">I don’t know how many men there, I forgot.</span> <span id="s1359">I know it was something like a couple hundred.</span> <span id="s1360">All the British soldiers step one step forward.</span> <span id="s1361">And there was [indecipherable] for a prison camp.</span> <span id="s1362">And my uncle was found out anyway, but they couldn’t prove that he had not -- he’d given British citizenship, which he -- which he hadn’t.</span> <span id="s1363">He was still German citizen.</span> <span id="s1364">So may -- the -- when he finally [indecipherable] he became PW, and then [indecipherable] one day the Gestapo, and had him on the list.</span> <span id="s1365">He said he cannot stay in this prison camp, he is a Jew, and he is a danger to this country.</span> <span id="s1366">They send him to another camp, the people were punished [indecipherable] and he -- he --</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">Q: I’m -- I’m just going to interrupt you for a moment.</span> <span id="s1368">I think we should focus on your own story as much as we can, just because of our limitations of time.</span> <span id="s1369">So, I -- I -- maybe we should just get back to the chronology, and you were talking about being in Paris, and you had left Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">A: Paris [indecipherable] the only interesting thing I did in Paris, was when there was information on being phony American dollars printed in Marseilles.</span> <span id="s1371">And the French knew all about it, and they were appearing in Germany, that’s where they used that phony -- that scrip money, and there was a lot of Black Market going on.</span> <span id="s1372">So the French said they found the printing press in Marseilles.</span> <span id="s1373">They asked me want to go along for the ride, not to do anything.</span> <span id="s1374">Take my gun with me, but not to do anything [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1375">Went down there -- and I was afraid of the French, because they always had [indecipherable] for money, just like here.</span> <span id="s1376">Like giving the whole thing away, and selling it [indecipherable] on the way down, and [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1377">So I was very careful.</span> <span id="s1378">We came down and they didn’t know about it, you know?</span> <span id="s1379">And police covered all the exits, and told them to wait, and they called [indecipherable] pretty soon it got pretty interesting.</span> <span id="s1380">I myself had a small experience with phony money, because of my language background.</span> <span id="s1381">And phony money was the thing at the time, that had a value, you guy in the PX for it.</span> <span id="s1382">PX has everything.</span> <span id="s1383">And in Heidelberg there was a [indecipherable] there’s some guy who sells phony dollars, the occupation dollars.</span> <span id="s1384">And my boss, “Well Willner, you go find out, by yourself, otherwise two come, they think [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1385">Go by yourself.”</span> <span id="s1386">I figured, well, phony money cannot very dangerous.</span> <span id="s1387">The guy has a gun, he probably is out there -- what they call the -- what did they call Eichmann, they -- shripeshoop.</span> <span id="s1388">They gave a nickname, shripeshruf merror.</span> <span id="s1389">The mer -- office [indecipherable] all that stuff, killing people, went out on paper wi -- in his office.</span> <span id="s1390">He didn’t work there in the country, he visits it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">End of Tape Three, Side B Beginning Tape Four, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">Q: This is tape number four, side A.</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">Q: I’ve got the tape recorder on again, so you were going -- were you going to tell me about how you met your wife?</span> <span id="s1395">Oh, I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s1396">I started too soon.</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">A: Was -- the reason why I was successful, and it’s amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">A: [indecipherable] before you have a -- the boss told me there’s a guy who was a distributor, like people do cocaine, or -- but phony money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">A: And I thought we were going to do like in France, [indecipherable] big.</span> <span id="s1402">He was carrying the money around, selling the people for German marks.</span> <span id="s1403">I wanted six people to support me, because you never know what’s behind it, and what members when they go -- be by -- by myself, because y -- they never suspect you, you’re short, nobody thinks you’re with the police.</span> <span id="s1404">“Yeah,” I said, “but who is there to help me if -- to [indecipherable] over there?”</span> <span id="s1405">“I’ll have some people sent in by [indecipherable].”</span> <span id="s1406">I go in this place in Germany, in a coffee house, meet the guy, and I [indecipherable], “Do you have the money?”</span> <span id="s1407">“Yup.”</span> <span id="s1408">“Can I see a sample of it?”</span> <span id="s1409">He said, “What do you want it for?”</span> <span id="s1410">I said, “Well, I’m immigrating to the United States pretty soon, I earn a lot of -- more German marks on the Black Market, I want to convert it into money.”</span> <span id="s1411">[indecipherable] then have to get green dollars for it.</span> <span id="s1412">He looked at me, “Where you from?”</span> <span id="s1413">I made a lie.</span> <span id="s1414">“Are you Jewish?”</span> <span id="s1415">That was just how -- he thought I was a Jew who was immigrating [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1416">I said, “No, I think -- but I still [indecipherable] some money.</span> <span id="s1417">Aren’t you -- are you seller, or aren’t you?”</span> <span id="s1418">I said and the phony money, all this was being recorded on me, and I had a [indecipherable] turned out to be outside in case anything happens, and more than one guy there that I could sound the alarm.</span> <span id="s1419">So, I mean, I [indecipherable] sat there at the table.</span> <span id="s1420">I said, “Can you show me a sample?”</span> <span id="s1421">I said, “What for?”</span> <span id="s1422">No, he said, “What for?”</span> <span id="s1423">I said, “I want to know -- I’m not buying this for myself, I’m buying this for a friend of mine, but he is in a position, he cannot be seen.”</span> <span id="s1424">Okay.</span> <span id="s1425">“[indecipherable] show me a sample.”</span> <span id="s1426">But the money he wanted for it was quite high, and I think if it’s high, he has probably good production, that will pass for -- for real.</span> <span id="s1427">Then may a problem, and this doesn’t look good, it’s no problem.</span> <span id="s1428">So, he takes out a bill under the table, he hands it to me under the table, and he says, “That’s a risky business.</span> <span id="s1429">I hope nobody’s watching us.”</span> <span id="s1430">And the police all over, he just sat there.</span> <span id="s1431">“Yeah,” I said, “probably, but why here [indecipherable]?</span> <span id="s1432">Nobody following me, you know.”</span> <span id="s1433">Okay, him -- we made a deal, he gave me bag of money, I paid him, and the moment the translation -- the transaction was completed -- completed, he said -- I say, “You’re under arrest,” in German.</span> <span id="s1434">But I had no right to.</span> <span id="s1435">I was a German under the -- in the company of a German policeman.</span> <span id="s1436">Well, we just didn’t have one at that, and the moment I said that, he looked at the rear door, he looked there, he was going to escape it, but I had his money, and I said, “[indecipherable], if you think of getting out of here without getting caught, you’re mistaken.</span> <span id="s1437">I have a military police company outside, of over a hundred men.”</span> <span id="s1438">It wasn’t true at all.</span> <span id="s1439">And he said to me that he’s stupid, and that -- that I have to understand they have to do this to make the money, well, other people [indecipherable] making money now.</span> <span id="s1440">But then I came out, he esc-escorted me out -- I never even called the guys in.</span> <span id="s1441">I walked out the front door with him, and took big MP’s kind of by the arm, and put him in jail.</span> <span id="s1442">So that was my [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1443">Then I go in from Heidelberg, to Paris already [indecipherable] that too?</span> <span id="s1444">And [indecipherable] Paris -- Liege, Belgium.</span> <span id="s1445">Liege is a pretty big town, for Belgium it’s warm.</span> <span id="s1446">And I lived there before in Brussels, if you remember?</span> <span id="s1447">So I was very happy to get to Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">Q: Were you in touch with the family that had -- y-your foster family in Belgium at all after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">A: [indecipherable] I -- I told you about that, and when the [indecipherable] the manager.</span> <span id="s1450">Didn’t I tell you that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1451">Q: Not on tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">A: Okay, I -- I -- I’ll weave that in here.</span> <span id="s1453">I had been in Belgium before, and I enjoyed my assignment there.</span> <span id="s1454">Then one day my job was changed.</span> <span id="s1455">Instead of doing criminal investigation, I was going to do congressional investigation from our [indecipherable] here.</span> <span id="s1456">And they needed qualified or -- investigators for that, partially speaking the language.</span> <span id="s1457">What happened, congressional investigations in washing, if you had a son who was the army during the invasion of France, or in Germany, and he was found missing in action -- there were many of them, thousands, but they had also quite a few hundred who deserted, who didn’t want to fight, and who got married to other women, local women.</span> <span id="s1458">Had already wife in the United States, maybe children.</span> <span id="s1459">And the last that we knew of them, he never showed up, he disappeared from his unit.</span> <span id="s1460">So, a guy didn’t show up in his unit, that could happen he got lost, or had a girl from someplace, then he was AWOL.</span> <span id="s1461">AWOL is absent without leave.</span> <span id="s1462">He would get some small punishment for that, but they cannot give you more than 30 days in jail, unless the guy stays a-away, excuse me, a year or something, then it’s desertion, it becomes automatically desertion.</span> <span id="s1463">So, congressional investigation demanded the parents, let’s say, had the son missing in France, he was never found.</span> <span id="s1464">We have cemeteries over there, and usually people got buried in our American cemeteries.</span> <span id="s1465">We do not have cemeteries in Germany.</span> <span id="s1466">It’s not a fact well known, because our law says we will not bury American soldiers in enemy territory if they get killed there.</span> <span id="s1467">So if they got killed in Germany, they had to transport it back to France, or -- or Holland, or Belgium.</span> <span id="s1468">Okay, so this congressional investigations were usually initiated by parents, who went to their congressman, say, “Hey, do something about it.</span> <span id="s1469">We want to get our son home in a casket [indecipherable] buried -- or even buried over there, but w -- what -- know what happened to him.”</span> <span id="s1470">So you could get people buried, not in Germany, but in France, Belgium.</span> <span id="s1471">So whatever the family decided.</span> <span id="s1472">I had the -- this cousin, who before the war, came to United States, he got killed in France, has a grave there in a military cem -- an American military cemetery, and I visit his grave, send the picture to his parents.</span> <span id="s1473">They were originally from Germany.</span> <span id="s1474">And then they ask me that the government told us we can have his body brought back here, buried a local cemetery, or have it -- him stay in a French cemetery.</span> <span id="s1475">I said, “Leave him there.</span> <span id="s1476">He’s dead.</span> <span id="s1477">I know y -- how you feel about him, but if you bring him here, what have you accomplished?</span> <span id="s1478">You go more often to the cemetery, you feel worse.</span> <span id="s1479">Sometimes gotta finish -- the war is finished, you can’t go on and on with these things.”</span> <span id="s1480">And -- he was the only son.</span> <span id="s1481">I said, “You had to -- you paid a high price for escaping Germany, came to United States, but that’s the way it goes.”</span> <span id="s1482">If I had to make a choice, my family [indecipherable] 10 members of the family, and what I’m po -- proposing is that we do a certain thing, but 10 -- out of 10, eight are -- eight [indecipherable] took them all alive.</span> <span id="s1483">I know this in advance, you may still do it, or you may not do anything at all, because you’re a coward, or you say this won’t work, or -- anyway, so in the -- in these congressional investigations, like I said, I -- we had to go further than the cemetery, the cemetery was only the last instance [indecipherable], or in the United States.</span> <span id="s1484">And the deal was -- my job was to find out from local people, if there was an American, or more, killed in that area.</span> <span id="s1485">They usually knew because the German shot him there, they were not going to bury him.</span> <span id="s1486">And then the French fo -- found him, and they make a local grave out of it, right in the cemetery, bury him.</span> <span id="s1487">So I said to this guy, “Do you have any unmarked graves here, where you don’t know whether they are Americans or German?”</span> <span id="s1488">He said yes, and that’s the way we usually worked it.</span> <span id="s1489">If they said yes, if they were sometimes a mound, not totally un-underground, they would say, “There a hundred soldiers buried here,” or, “There a hundred French soldiers buried here, a hundred American buried here.”</span> <span id="s1490">Or German troops with Americans.</span> <span id="s1491">We went to the extreme, our country, to -- which I -- I think is -- was right, even this point.</span> <span id="s1492">These guys, they died for their country, and they have a right to be properly take care of.</span> <span id="s1493">So -- and finally -- so what I finally [indecipherable] hundred guys that the farmer told me, “I don’t know, we -- we just picked up these guys after the battle was over, and they were dead, and we threw them all in a hole, covered up.”</span> <span id="s1494">I said, “Are they Germans, or Americans?”</span> <span id="s1495">He said, “I think they’re mixed, they [indecipherable].”</span> <span id="s1496">Sometime that is only German.</span> <span id="s1497">I said, “Okay, we got to open this grave up.”</span> <span id="s1498">That wasn’t my job.</span> <span id="s1499">They had what they call graves registration teams.</span> <span id="s1500">They were Americans, comprised of guys, and linguists, and dentists sometimes with dental charts, and what was the other thing?</span> <span id="s1501">Well, may -- they -- if I thought, or somebody else thought, among those hundred Germans, may be two Americans we’re looking for, they decided to dig them all up, and sometimes that the uniforms, they were a mess.</span> <span id="s1502">But fortunately, I didn’t have anything to do with that, I just had to investigation, and -- and then report, and then they took action on what to do about it.</span> <span id="s1503">So I had this place with about a hundred Germans, and I said to this farmer, “Are you sure they’re no Americans?”</span> <span id="s1504">Because I got after action reports from the army, before I [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1505">They said the 75th infantry company went through there, through the area, and I had a map -- had their all map f -- when they went to the war, and they send out two scouts, to find out where the Germans [indecipherable], and those two scouts never came back.</span> <span id="s1506">I have reason to assume they got killed, if they were taken prisoner, and they could have [indecipherable] as prisoners, but prisoners we usually found alive.</span> <span id="s1507">So, here already hundred or so Germans, and they decided to dig up.</span> <span id="s1508">When I said I come back in two or three days, when you should be finished, and then -- and they had not archaeologists, but they had dentists sometime, and [indecipherable] soldiers.</span> <span id="s1509">And they couldn’t, they were bloody and rotten already.</span> <span id="s1510">But the teeth, you could tell.</span> <span id="s1511">And the other thing was dogtags.</span> <span id="s1512">Had the dogtags, you have two of them, and take one off and take it with you, to report that this man was killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">Q: But were all these bodies from the last battles of World War two, or were -- what was the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">A: [indecipherable] yeah, probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">Q: So there were [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">A: Except -- except for the ardents.</span> <span id="s1517">The ardents offensive -- where I worked my way through [indecipherable] there was the ardents, or the -- they have another name, too.</span> <span id="s1518">The Hertkin Forest battle.</span> <span id="s1519">Hertkin forest was very tall trees, and the artillery shells [indecipherable] up the top, there was bird and [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1520">And many people got killed by shellbursts from the top, the Germans were shooting not to the bottom, but to the top, because the top created a lot of splinters, and whatnot, and -- and -- and then spread out to the [indecipherable] underground [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1521">But in this hundred men grave, I came back a few days, and they -- we -- they told me, “We didn’t find what you asked for, but we found something else interesting.”</span> <span id="s1522">Not the guy -- the guys were looking for.</span> <span id="s1523">And they came with a box, and in that box was half a leg, and in that half a leg was a pair of boots, American boots.</span> <span id="s1524">So right away I knew these were American’s feet, I didn’t have to look at a dogtags, I think.</span> <span id="s1525">And so I said to guy, “Well, put this in the box,” clean it up, took some of the dirt off.</span> <span id="s1526">And then I said, “Open up the boots.”</span> <span id="s1527">So he opens the boots, we gi -- at the time we had boots, they were not boots total, they -- on the side we had two closures, you tied them up[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1528">So, opened it up, and I find the guy’s name in there.</span> <span id="s1529">He turn -- didn’t turn out to be the two guys I was looking for, but another guy who was also missing in action -- I thou -- I thought was missing in action.</span> <span id="s1530">So apparently, during the fights there, he had his leg shot off, and I said, “Well, his body must be nearby or something.”</span> <span id="s1531">And I said to the guys, “You want to dig a little further [indecipherable]?”</span> <span id="s1532">And they didn’t feel like it, I didn’t feel like it.</span> <span id="s1533">I said, “Okay.”</span> <span id="s1534">I know we don’t tell the congressional investigator that we found a leg, that there was the rest of the body [indecipherable] whole thing.</span> <span id="s1535">I said, “But they will be convinced that he is killed, maybe.”</span> <span id="s1536">I -- you see, I was not in favor in spending so much -- too many dollars with digging up people [indecipherable] rested in peace.</span> <span id="s1537">And we sent that box back to the States by air.</span> <span id="s1538">Five days later I get a call.</span> <span id="s1539">Wh -- some colonel on the phone.</span> <span id="s1540">“What are you doing out there, Willner?</span> <span id="s1541">You having a lot of fun?”</span> <span id="s1542">I didn’t know what he was talking about.</span> <span id="s1543">He said, “Or you have nothing to do, you do things like you do?”</span> <span id="s1544">I said, “Colonel,” I said, “tell -- I -- I don’t know what you’re talking about.”</span> <span id="s1545">“Well, you send us back a leg.”</span> <span id="s1546">These were the people that they -- they have [indecipherable] like a morgue, they process dead bodies, clean them up, put them in nice box, very fancy.</span> <span id="s1547">And so he said, “The leg you dug up, you want to talk to the guy?”</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1550">The leg had been shot off, and the guy was alive in United States.</span> <span id="s1551">[indecipherable] his serial number, and they found him, and then they went to the Pentagon, and said serial number such and such, he wasn’t killed, he -- he’s right here.</span> <span id="s1552">So I was, you say the butt of joke or something, for a long time down there, I am digging up legs, and finding guys that alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">Q: So this was in -- during the -- the bat -- World War two, that he had lost his leg?</span></p> <p><span id="s1554">A: World War two, on the Belgian -- Belgian, French and German border, generally.</span> <span id="s1555">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">Q: What -- what -- how did you feel about being in -- being in Germany again after the war, and doing this work for the American army?</span> <span id="s1557">Did you feel comfortable?</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">A: I had a great time, I found my personal -- a lot of satisfaction, being successful, had a free hand, my boss was so good that I went out in faraway places, and the weekends were coming up, I would have liked to be home, but I liked to see other places, too.</span> <span id="s1559">Had a Jeep available, and a driver.</span> <span id="s1560">Normally a team consists of three people, one officer, one sergeant or corporal, and one dri -- drivers were these Polish guys who went [indecipherable] United States, they employ them as guard, or driver.</span> <span id="s1561">So I -- I was operating [indecipherable] also very independent, and the boss we had, he kept the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1562">He said that I was doing a great job, and normally he said, “There’s an officer, but I cannot promote you to become an officer, you got to go to school, and -- but I’ll give you another promotion.”</span> <span id="s1563">Got another stripe, and on -- once a year you have an inspection of people who don’t normally wear a uniform, who -- who work in special units, and my boss came around for some general took once a year look at you.</span> <span id="s1564">And we had to have all our uniforms in a closet, neat, pressed, insignia and all that.</span> <span id="s1565">And it had to be open, not locked.</span> <span id="s1566">And we went about our jobs while these guys were looking our stuff.</span> <span id="s1567">And I had my hung up properly, and everything cleaned, and shoes shined, you play soldier again.</span> <span id="s1568">And then captain -- that evening, Captain Marcus called me in.</span> <span id="s1569">He said, “Willner, apparently the general knows you, he heard of you.</span> <span id="s1570">You do [indecipherable] sharp here, but you got one problem.</span> <span id="s1571">The question was why you not an officer.”</span> <span id="s1572">I told him same story, you have to be a citizen first, and you cannot become commander of American troops if you’re not a citizen, only if you’re doctor, a chaplain, or -- you can’t be foreign -- not [indecipherable] foreigner.”</span> <span id="s1573">So he said, “Yeah, but he looked particularly through your stuff, he wanted to see what -- how you keep your stuff.</span> <span id="s1574">He [indecipherable] nothing -- anything about your stuff, but I found you -- you -- he put me i-in a bad shape.</span> <span id="s1575">I -- he -- the general asked me what grade I have by now, and I told him sergeant.</span> <span id="s1576">And we open up your locker, and you find corporal stripes on there.</span> <span id="s1577">That’s one less stripe [indecipherable] there are three.</span> <span id="s1578">Why is that?”</span> <span id="s1579">I said, “Captain Marcus, I tell you frankly.</span> <span id="s1580">I feel like a nothing with just two stripes.</span> <span id="s1581">I -- I -- I decided I’m going to put my stripes on when I have three stripes, to amount to something.”</span> <span id="s1582">He know -- I was a good [indecipherable] Captain Marcus, I could say that, and he laughed, and, “Look, if you don’t have them on by tomorrow morning, I’m going to take your three stripes away, you -- you’ll be nothing but a private.”</span> <span id="s1583">[indecipherable] and what -- then I wrote a letter, I think I can get [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1584">I wrote a letter to the general, and I said it’s not normal to -- for a sergeant to write to a general, and has permission from his commanding officer, and I do not have permission from my commanding officer, he doesn’t know about it, but I’d like to explain something.</span> <span id="s1585">And what he -- what I explain is maybe not acceptable to you either.</span> <span id="s1586">It was not acceptable to Captain Marcus.</span> <span id="s1587">I told him that I think not because I earned them, or I’m capable of doing the job, I just thought th-three stripes were better than two stripes, it’s a higher rank.</span> <span id="s1588">A lot of guys had two stripes, but [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1589">And he laughed, he -- okay.</span> <span id="s1590">Captain Marcus took care of it, have me put them on.</span> <span id="s1591">I know.</span> <span id="s1592">I had the same thing happen to officer’s school.</span> <span id="s1593">You get promoted if you’re a private or -- or is a [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1594">Okay, my three year -- now comes the important part.</span> <span id="s1595">My three year less -- lesson -- enlistment was up.</span> <span id="s1596">I had learned English better, I have got myself a high school diploma.</span> <span id="s1597">The army had arrangements with state of New York board of education, that for military people who needed a high school diploma, they can take courses, or they can take a final examination for high school, and the state of New York will issue a high school diploma, even if you have not graduated from high school, provided you pass the exam.</span> <span id="s1598">So I looked at, and asked the guy that was in charge of it, looked at this and see if I am -- where I was weak.</span> <span id="s1599">I always felt weak in -- in m -- n -- math, or English maybe.</span> <span id="s1600">I looked at it, it didn’t look that difficult to me.</span> <span id="s1601">And I said, “I’ll take the exam without studying, and if I don’t pass, I’ll start studying [indecipherable].”</span> <span id="s1602">I took a 10 hour examination, five sections each, and passed with flying colors.</span> <span id="s1603">I was so happy.</span> <span id="s1604">And that qualified me to take another test to become an officer, because you have to be -- and the other things involved, first of all, because the Korean war was going on, they accepted people with less education to get them to officer’s school without a college degree.</span> <span id="s1605">But you had to have a high school diploma, and to be a citizen.</span> <span id="s1606">So I had the high school diploma, but I didn’t -- I wasn’t a citizen yet.</span> <span id="s1607">And with the -- I explain that, an-and in past a system has been developed, it also has to have college education [indecipherable] army.</span> <span id="s1608">They used to have a time where you can get your college education in the army.</span> <span id="s1609">The University of Maryland, Virginia, they taught courses in the Pentagon, and some other place.</span> <span id="s1610">And they -- so that’s what -- what was I go -- what I was going to do.</span> <span id="s1611">But I was up 19 -- three years, and I saved up all my leave time, which was 30 days a year, I never took leave, never went on vacation, and Captain Marcus knew this, and he said, “When you go to Paris, and you have to stay over the weekend, in the arm -- army’s expense, because something ready for you, you are spending time working with other soldiers that are taking the weekend off, going someplace.</span> <span id="s1612">And I will make a special deal, which I’m also as commanding officer.</span> <span id="s1613">I know you saving up your leave time for other things more serious.</span> <span id="s1614">So when you in Paris, on Saturday, you don’t have to come back, you want to stay there you stay there,” and this is -- I -- he -- he -- commanding officer could give you le -- leave time, three days, no more.</span> <span id="s1615">It was only three days you had to take [indecipherable] leave, and it was just at his -- it’s like an award they -- they gave away three day passes to guys who did good jobs, who wanted to see their families.</span> <span id="s1616">And so I had 90 days, the agreement with [indecipherable] was I go back to New York, I go to the -- get my citizenship, and the requirement was that, when you get a citizenship if you’re in the army, it’s three years, if you’re a civilian, five years, unless you’re the wife of a military, and he is all -- overseas, and he can -- the wife can get it two years, I think, because they prefer to be citizens, to protect the pe -- United States.</span> <span id="s1617">So -- End of Tape Four, Side A Beginning Tape Four, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">A: -- planes, but the Dutch knew, or they want metal detectors [indecipherable] but we’re sitting [indecipherable] and they go melting, and discover or find the plane.</span> <span id="s1619">And the pilot’s still sitting in his seat, completely preserved.</span> <span id="s1620">I’ve seen it.</span> <span id="s1621">And the reason why preco -- preserved, because the ground is different, and it’s calcium, and whatever is in there.</span> <span id="s1622">It’s very soft, and it’s very -- it -- it’s like what do you call that, embalming stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">A: And it -- it’s exciting when you see a young pilot, and the last place he sits, and he just --</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">Q: I’m just -- say this is tape number four, side B, and we’re -- we’re rolling.</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1627">I got my nine -- 90 days of leave, was to carry out some personal affairs in New York, maybe get my citizenship, and then re-enlist in the army, if I get to go to officer’s school, because you could not go -- you could pass the examination -- entrance examination, but you could not go to officer’s school unless you went in front of a board, and they -- they voted for you.</span> <span id="s1628">Nine people usually, they ask you questions.</span> <span id="s1629">And -- but like I said, I needed the citizenship paper.</span> <span id="s1630">And I figure 90 days enough, because [indecipherable] said three years in the army, and what was the other one?</span> <span id="s1631">No punishments, you didn’t go to jail for anything, had a clear record.</span> <span id="s1632">And three years in ma -- and oh yeah, three years, and -- and then you -- you re-enlist, otherwise you leave the army.</span> <span id="s1633">And then you had to show the high school diploma, and your citizenship papers, and then you had to go in front of a board of officers, and this was not my area, New York, this was in Governor’s Island, you know, Governor’s Island, New York.</span> <span id="s1634">Governor’s Island had at one time military people on there, and offices, there was a whole fort, and that’s where I had to go to get all my administration done.</span> <span id="s1635">But I didn’t have anybody to help me, I had to carry my [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1636">But my main concern was to get to be a citizen so I could go in Governor’s Island in front of the board, and the boards are maybe done twice a month, or something like that.</span> <span id="s1637">And then they give you a selected, or not selected.</span> <span id="s1638">So, I went there the day for two months to the headquarter of the immigration naturalization service in New York, on [indecipherable], and stood in line, you know.</span> <span id="s1639">And I got very upset.</span> <span id="s1640">I figure, I’m qualified, I did nothing wrong, and these people are preventing me from doing what I want to do, [indecipherable] me up with office school not in being in time, and the army realized they -- can realize they [indecipherable] can -- can do all these things.</span> <span id="s1641">And already 60 days gone by, and I talked to an officer, and he even said [indecipherable] advice, he said, “Willner, go to Washington, go to the Pentagon.</span> <span id="s1642">These are civilians here who -- they’re bureaucratic, well, the military are bureaucratic, but they like to give people the runaround.</span> <span id="s1643">But if you are qualified, really qualified, I don’t see any reason why you shouldn’t go to the Pentagon, let them help you out.</span> <span id="s1644">Your people.</span> <span id="s1645">You [indecipherable].”</span> <span id="s1646">It’s a funny thing.</span> <span id="s1647">I walk in the Pentagon, in to the adjutant general’s section, I didn’t know who to see, and I told them I have a serious matter, I’m going to talk somebody high up, [indecipherable] said that colonel so and so will see you.</span> <span id="s1648">I walk in there, gave him a sharp salute, and told him my story.</span> <span id="s1649">I mentioned concentration camps, I mentioned citizenship, and what I’d done in the army so far, and the guy was impressed.</span> <span id="s1650">And he said to me -- I said -- my opinion is they give me the runaround for one reason or another.</span> <span id="s1651">Well, if you’re qualified, you’re qualified, that’s -- we’ll take you into -- and he grabs the phone, and he mang up the phone, he said, “By the way, are you a republican or a democrat?”</span> <span id="s1652">I didn’t know what to say, I figure I’ll say a democratic, he’s a republican, he’s not going to help me.</span> <span id="s1653">And I was really a -- up -- I was nervous.</span> <span id="s1654">I think I have to say something.</span> <span id="s1655">So the guy said -- I said, “Sir, I’m not even a citizen yet.”</span> <span id="s1656">Make an excuse.</span> <span id="s1657">I [indecipherable] “I’m not even a citizen yet, so I can’t vote.”</span> <span id="s1658">Well, he said, “Make up your mind.</span> <span id="s1659">Do you want to become citizen?</span> <span id="s1660">Say you are a citizen, what would you vote, democratic or republican?”</span> <span id="s1661">Again, this is [indecipherable], I said democrat.</span> <span id="s1662">He said, “Good.”</span> <span id="s1663">He was a democrat.</span> <span id="s1664">But -- so I -- I-I -- I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">Q: So you were lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s1666">A: I was l-lucky.</span> <span id="s1667">I was lucky.</span> <span id="s1668">Now I’m more luck -- even luckier than that.</span> <span id="s1669">He still had the phone in his hand, dialed a number -- I didn’t know he was going to, and during the ta -- and came through, he was talking to Franklin Delano Roosevelt, junior -- junior fo -- the son, who was a congressman, and he was a golf partner of him.</span> <span id="s1670">That’s how the colonel knew Roosevelt.</span> <span id="s1671">He was a big one, looked like his father.</span> <span id="s1672">And he said on the phone -- called him by his first name, and, “I have a young sergeant in my office, he had an interesting story, something for our public information people, maybe.”</span> <span id="s1673">He said, “No, never mind public information, I’d like to talk with the guy [indecipherable].”</span> <span id="s1674">And the colonel said to me, “Well, I don’t know if you haven’t gotten it by now, but I’ve been talking to Franklin Roosevelt.</span> <span id="s1675">Not the president,” he was dead already, “but his son, he’s a congressman, he may be able to help you.”</span> <span id="s1676">So I -- I said -- I figured that it’s probably true, he can help me.</span> <span id="s1677">And then he asked a few more questions that Franklin wanted answered, and he said, “Ask Sargent Willner he’s free for lunch.”</span> <span id="s1678">Of course I was free for lunch you know, a guy like him, and have the honor to meet somebody like [indecipherable], and somebody who could help me, really.</span> <span id="s1679">Better than na -- in the army colonel, you know, [indecipherable] general.</span> <span id="s1680">So he said -- yeah, and the colonel said, “I’ll,” -- he asked me I had transportation, I said no.</span> <span id="s1681">“Well, I get a staff car.”</span> <span id="s1682">So they go and get me a staff car, he took me to Roosevelt’s office on the hill, and we greet each other, and he said, “I heard you have an interesting story.”</span> <span id="s1683">I didn’t tell him how I told you, but I told him a little bit.</span> <span id="s1684">He said, “How about your family [indecipherable]”.</span> <span id="s1685">Nobody survived.</span> <span id="s1686">“And, so what’s your future?”</span> <span id="s1687">I didn’t want to shoot too high, but I said [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1688">I said, “I -- you know I’m here because my citizenship.</span> <span id="s1689">I passed the examination [indecipherable] officer candidate school.</span> <span id="s1690">I haven’t passed the board yet for officer, because they won’t take me until I’m a citizen, and that’s what -- what the problem is.</span> <span id="s1691">I’m fully qualified, and you have to be a citizen before they -- the board takes you [indecipherable] become an o -- become an officer.”</span> <span id="s1692">“Okay,” he said, “[indecipherable] make a reservation for two someplace, yeah.</span> <span id="s1693">I -- I got to call this.”</span> <span id="s1694">He called the commissioner of immigration naturalization in New York, he was a retired general, forgot his name, but he [indecipherable] him up.</span> <span id="s1695">And he said to him -- he was ordering him to, “General,” -- they all [indecipherable] general [indecipherable] retire.</span> <span id="s1696">“I have a young sergeant here, he has a perfect -- perfect record and everything.</span> <span id="s1697">He’s a refugee from Germany.</span> <span id="s1698">I think he’ll be a good officer, I think we need some fresh blood, and he’s given the runaround by your people.”</span> <span id="s1699">And he didn’t talk back, but he wrote down the information, and then he said, “Yes, that’s all.”</span> <span id="s1700">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1701">“Oh, one more thing,” he apparently said he’s going to call the people responsible for this, you know, right away.</span> <span id="s1702">And Roosevelt said, “I’m not going to wait very long, and Willner hasn’t got long, I will see this to the end, before the month is up.”</span> <span id="s1703">So when I -- he made the reservation, and he called the general in New York, he said, before we left -- I don’t know if it was an hour, 11:30.</span> <span id="s1704">I know some people take long lunches, but by one o’clock, I want an answer from you personally.</span> <span id="s1705">Call his office what the state of it is.</span> <span id="s1706">If there’s a problem, no problem, I want everything handled immediately.</span> <span id="s1707">I could have lied and said something that -- that they didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1708">So we went to lunch, we had a good lunch, we didn’t talk about anything bad, he just asked me some questions -- you asked me how -- how I felt the United States, and if I knew about his father, and I have a letter hanging, from him, downstairs, and he asked me about the situation in Germany, what I thought about it.</span> <span id="s1709">And my knowledge was limited except to what I experienced.</span> <span id="s1710">He had some political questions, too.</span> <span id="s1711">But we had a good conversation, and he said, “Well, the army’s not for everybody, if you do all right, I -- three years won’t do you any harm.</span> <span id="s1712">But maybe you want to become a politician like me.”</span> <span id="s1713">And I was going to say, “Well, with a father like yours, that’s easy,” you know, but probably -- only now foreign born people become politicians, too.</span> <span id="s1714">Hey, there’s a Holocaust survivor, too, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1715">Q: Mm-hm [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1716">A: And [indecipherable] politician [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1717">I don’t know, but we kidded around a lot, and yeah, oh yeah, yeah, I know what he said, “But not like my brother.”</span> <span id="s1718">You know his brother’s story?</span> <span id="s1719">He had another brother -- he had several brothers, in cali -- in California, James.</span> <span id="s1720">He [indecipherable] he make me laugh, or something, and he said -- I -- I -- I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1721">I never heard the name James.</span> <span id="s1722">But I said -- “Oh, oh, you don’t know.</span> <span id="s1723">He’s running for office again, and he’s quite a ladies man, he’s married.</span> <span id="s1724">And he just had a very interesting poster put out about him by the opposition.</span> <span id="s1725">He -- he had a folder -- poster they were putting in California on the walls, and it said on there, send Jimmy back to Washington.</span> <span id="s1726">The wife you save may be your own.”</span> <span id="s1727">You have your -- laugh about his brother, you know, fooling around, and it’s so funny.</span> <span id="s1728">He was really a -- he was really -- I check on it later [indecipherable], and he was such a ladies man.</span></p> <p><span id="s1729">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1730">A: And so then we came back from lunch, and the secretary said, “The gentleman called already.</span> <span id="s1731">He didn’t want to talk to me, he wanted to talk to you.”</span> <span id="s1732">Said okay, he take the phone.</span> <span id="s1733">And I’m making this up, I mean, I didn’t hear what he said, but he must have asked Roosevelt if I could be next morning in New York.</span> <span id="s1734">And Roosevelt asked me if I could be there.</span> <span id="s1735">“Sure.</span> <span id="s1736">I’ll -- I’ll get a private plane [indecipherable] but -- but I’ll be there.”</span> <span id="s1737">He said, “You’ll be -- not going -- you’re not going there just to talk to people, you’re going to be sworn in citizen tomorrow morning.</span> <span id="s1738">So get a clean uniform.”</span> <span id="s1739">I said I don’t have any [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1740">So -- and you may have to answer some questions there.</span> <span id="s1741">So I was next morning in New York.</span> <span id="s1742">They had a special ceremony for me, I was the only one.</span> <span id="s1743">I walked in [indecipherable] room, and there’s a woman judge, and she said, “So you want to become a citizen?</span> <span id="s1744">You already half a citizen, you are military sergeant, and I’m not going to ask you a lot of questions, but just a few.”</span> <span id="s1745">She want to put me at ease.</span> <span id="s1746">And I was worried, I -- I hadn’t studied like my wife did later on, I -- just when I ran into.</span> <span id="s1747">I was too busy, and too nervous.</span> <span id="s1748">He -- she -- she said, “Who’s Uncle Sam?”</span> <span id="s1749">“Well,” I said, “he’s the guy I work for.”</span> <span id="s1750">And then she said, in getting more serious, she said, “If you’re a citizen, are you willing to pay taxes?”</span> <span id="s1751">I thought it was a stupid thing, I said, “Yes, off course.”</span> <span id="s1752">I said, “Not be willing to pay taxes, I don’t think I can get to see.</span> <span id="s1753">The military take -- takes the taxes out of your pay right away.</span> <span id="s1754">So -- but I’m willing to pay taxes.”</span> <span id="s1755">And I don’t remember the third question she asked me.</span> <span id="s1756">So I was sworn in --</span></p> <p><span id="s1757">Q: She only asked you three questions?</span></p> <p><span id="s1758">A: Two.</span></p> <p><span id="s1759">Q: Two questions, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1760">A: And the swearing in ceremony was very nice, but people -- my [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1761">Q: -- the thing about the swearing in ceremony.</span></p> <p><span id="s1762">A: After I was sworn in, I had my certificate, I immediately went back to my place, I packed, and that -- for New York.</span> <span id="s1763">And I left [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1764">So when I came to New York, my next move was to get in front of the officer selection board, and I had my papers, and I went to Governor’s Island.</span> <span id="s1765">There was the headquarters of the first U.S. army.</span> <span id="s1766">And I went in there, and told them what the story was, and they said they have selection boards only once or twice a month.</span> <span id="s1767">I said, “That might be trouble, so w -- when’s the next selection board meeting?”</span> <span id="s1768">And he didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1769">And I was lucky again, there’s meeting next morning, but I was not on the list of people to be interviewed.</span> <span id="s1770">So they added me to it.</span> <span id="s1771">And they say this is a special, and -- so I came in front of the board, there were nine officers, and there were about 20 or so people to [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1772">So I timed these people, see how long this takes.</span> <span id="s1773">Five minutes.</span> <span id="s1774">And I went in there, I was still going on for half an hour.</span> <span id="s1775">And I thought -- not like here is interesting, or -- I thought I’m not going to make it.</span> <span id="s1776">They’re asking real hard questions.</span> <span id="s1777">And nothing against me, they were very nice, but you -- you are nervous when you go.</span> <span id="s1778">This is my fu-future, and now I have everything, now I got to go to school, and then I worry about getting through school.</span> <span id="s1779">So, they ask me all kind of questions and I answer.</span> <span id="s1780">Then this thing was finished, I was the last one, I had to take the ferry back from Ellis Island to New York -- Manhattan.</span> <span id="s1781">I got in a ferry, and one major was on the ferry, and there was an aboard, and he said hello [indecipherable] far away.</span> <span id="s1782">And then I decided I’m going to make a move.</span> <span id="s1783">I know it’s not legal for him to tell me, but I made [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1784">I’ve got to know, I won’t be able to sleep.</span> <span id="s1785">People had told me I will be notified in about a week.</span> <span id="s1786">And the way this thing worked up there, I know they asked me a lot of questions they didn’t ask the other people.</span> <span id="s1787">They were concerned, I was a foreigner, who was going to be in charge of American troops, maybe with a career, and into combat.</span> <span id="s1788">They wanted someho -- body they can trust, and they -- so when I left, I didn’t know whether am I going to make it or not.</span> <span id="s1789">So I find this major on the boat, on the ferry.</span> <span id="s1790">I go over to him, and I say, “Excuse me sir, I know it’s illegal, I know you cannot give me the answer, but I’m going to ask you anyway, because I’m so damn nervous.</span> <span id="s1791">I’ve been waiting for this for a long time [indecipherable] problems, they all got straightened out, and you got 15 guys -- nine guys -- nine guys, and nobody took more than five minutes, one guy took 15 minutes, and I was in there at least half an hour.</span> <span id="s1792">I like to know where I stand.</span> <span id="s1793">I know you cannot tell me whether I made it, cause they told me I’d be notified.</span> <span id="s1794">And -- can you give me an indication?”</span> <span id="s1795">I wa -- atsfa -- I tell you, the guy’s nice, he will say something.</span> <span id="s1796">And he said, “Well, I cannot tell you anything.</span> <span id="s1797">But you can go home, and tell your folks you did all right.</span> <span id="s1798">I know that you did all right.”</span> <span id="s1799">And so I was notified, and they did another nice thing, they changed my order, I didn’t have to go back to Europe and pick up the stuff I left there.</span> <span id="s1800">They sent it back, and the army immediately sent me to Fort Dix.</span> <span id="s1801">I went to a prep school first, for leadership training.</span> <span id="s1802">So I graduated -- and leadership training school was not mainly for officers -- for future officers, but for future sergeants.</span> <span id="s1803">For the guys who get higher, but need more leadership training, that was eight weeks.</span> <span id="s1804">But they added the officer candidates to it, and -- because the army say, “If they cannot make that course, they sure as hell cannot make the officer’s course.”</span> <span id="s1805">So I did that, I did all right, and I made two great acquaintance there, which were important in my life.</span> <span id="s1806">One was my best military friend, who was not Jewish, but who had also come from England, so he was military.</span> <span id="s1807">His father was American who went to England, married a British woman, and he was a sergeant [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1808">He became very good friend.</span> <span id="s1809">He got married while he was in school, when he was not allowed to get married.</span> <span id="s1810">With my money.</span> <span id="s1811">He’s -- asked me, one day he called up, “I got to get married.</span> <span id="s1812">I don’t want to lose this woman, can I borrow money from you?”</span> <span id="s1813">Remember this, that a lot of guys borrow money, but we never borrowed from [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1814">I said, “How much?”</span> <span id="s1815">He said, “300 dollars.”</span> <span id="s1816">I say, “Sure.”</span> <span id="s1817">I send him 300 dollars, he got married, he had three boys.</span> <span id="s1818">But then we started this school together, and went to Philadelphia, from Fort Dix, on the weekend, to go to a -- to go to an orchestra, I believe, philharmonic.</span> <span id="s1819">And a famous guy was there, a British conductor, sir -- sir -- sir -- in the military they got free tickets.</span> <span id="s1820">So we got together four guys, went to Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s1821">On the way back, a drunken guy drove into our car, he backed out, high speed.</span> <span id="s1822">I was asleep in the back seat, I wound up in the hospital.</span> <span id="s1823">I was five weeks in the hospital by a concussion, broken nose [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1824">And so I didn’t go to the course because I was atained in the hospital, but my best friend went.</span> <span id="s1825">So, I got healed, and then I’m [indecipherable] there to the doctor, my nose was going back to the side like this, it broke in two places.</span> <span id="s1826">And the specialist -- military specialist, didn’t want to correct it.</span> <span id="s1827">He had made a mistake and not set it back when it happened.</span> <span id="s1828">And he said, “Well, what do you want to be, a Clark Gable?”</span> <span id="s1829">“No,” I said, “I just want a straight nose again.”</span> <span id="s1830">I -- I -- and he said -- and start pushing on my nose, it started bleeding, and the nurse shook her head.</span> <span id="s1831">When he was out, she said, “Don’t take that doctor.”</span> <span id="s1832">“Yeah,” I said, “to me, he’s more like a veterinarian, or in Germany, they call a -- a horse doctor.</span> <span id="s1833">I never se-seen anything like that.”</span> <span id="s1834">And he told me to come in my quit.</span> <span id="s1835">He said, “You still want it done, you can be -- come to my clinic.”</span> <span id="s1836">And he want to do this again.</span> <span id="s1837">I said, “No, I’m refusing now to be touched by you.</span> <span id="s1838">I don’t think you’re doing the right thing.”</span> <span id="s1839">To make a long story short, a year later, Walter Reed Army Hospital operated, plastic surgeon, went put it back where it was.</span> <span id="s1840">Very nice [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1841">He was just -- just a jerk.</span> <span id="s1842">Then I went to day school, and we weren’t on the same class -- every class was 250 people, and my friend was ahead of me, but because he got married, his weekends were spent with his wife, he didn’t study too hard, and he flunked a couple of courses.</span> <span id="s1843">Not -- he was intelligent, but he -- he didn’t study.</span> <span id="s1844">So they had a deal in the school, if a guy is a good guy, he’s -- if he’s -- they think he’s capable of making [indecipherable], they gave him a second chance, they started him again the second time, beginning of the course, we had three months in already, and he flunked.</span> <span id="s1845">He was sent back to my class.</span> <span id="s1846">So he was -- here we were together again, and we graduate together.</span> <span id="s1847">And so in --</span></p> <p><span id="s1848">Q: We’ve just got a couple more minutes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1849">A: Okay, I will tell you one thing and then -- a very important thing I’d like to get it in -- not now, about prejudice at the officer candidate school.</span> <span id="s1850">And [indecipherable] the officer -- the class I was in, usually a hundred and tw -- 250 people started in class, and out of 250 people who were selected, 95 percent were college graduates, who were not in ROTC, [indecipherable] but who didn’t want to go to Korea [indecipherable],and who wanted to become officers.</span> <span id="s1851">So the -- there was a lot of competition, I didn’t have cl -- I just finished high school, but the requirement was that as soon as I become an officer, I -- I -- I studied for two years on the side, for two years college.</span> <span id="s1852">Now they changed that to college degree.</span> <span id="s1853">So I was lucky in that respect too, I can remember that, but the competition.</span> <span id="s1854">My room mate, we had two guys to a room, had [indecipherable] top guy, and he was from -- he had a master’s degree in hotel business.</span> <span id="s1855">He went to New Jersey someplace, or ne -- well anyway, he helped me a lot, and I helped him.</span> <span id="s1856">He was academically tops, and I was in some other things tops.</span> <span id="s1857">Like shine your shoes.</span> <span id="s1858">No, no, but physically.</span> <span id="s1859">So out of the 250 people, 121 graduated, less than 50 percent.</span> <span id="s1860">I was feeling pretty good, and I was number 112 out of 121, but I made it, first time.</span> <span id="s1861">They told me -- the officer’s told me if I don’t make it the first time, they’ll make me make it a second time, that my friend did.</span> <span id="s1862">And they thought I had the capability, and -- but they treated me very nice there, except one major who was prejudice.</span> <span id="s1863">And that story [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1864">Q: Okay, let’s stop there for today then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1865">End of Tape Four, Side B Beginning Tape Five, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1866">Q: It’s now the 13th of July, and we’re on tape number five, side A, of an interview with Eddie Willner.</span></p> <p><span id="s1867">A: I think we stopped yesterday on -- on when we graduated from school, and I gave you some figures.</span> <span id="s1868">Well, there was one major in the school who was what they call a tactical officer, who is instructor --</span></p> <p><span id="s1869">Q: Actually, we did the figures.</span> <span id="s1870">The only thing that -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1871">A: Yeah, the figures I -- I’m not going to mention.</span></p> <p><span id="s1872">Q: Yeah, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1873">A: So I’m -- when we actually graduated --</span></p> <p><span id="s1874">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1875">A: -- it was in a theater, with a stage, there were two generals there, and all our former instructors, and officers from the class, they were lined up on the stage.</span> <span id="s1876">So on -- there were three -- usually, an -- normally, there -- two people call on the stage to have the bars pinned on by a general.</span> <span id="s1877">He’s the top academic guy in the class, and the second guy is the top athletic guy, who wins all the military stakes mishum sports, and stuff like.</span> <span id="s1878">So the second guy got called up, and all of a sudden they call my name on the stage, and I was number 121 in line to get the bars, and only the first two get their bars pinned on by the general, and the others, somebody else pins them on.</span> <span id="s1879">I was called on stage, and we supposed to complete the prize to have the bars pinned on by a general because it was stated that I was the first naturalized citizen after the war who became an army officer.</span> <span id="s1880">Not only that, that I was cited for having done -- worked the hardest to become an officer.</span> <span id="s1881">And then the general made a joke, he said, “Are you f -- did you follow your or-orders from your immediate superiors not to go on weekends to a hotel and study -- sit in a room, but just to go out and have some fun?”</span> <span id="s1882">I said no.</span> <span id="s1883">I was ordered one time, because my colleagues reported me -- we had what in -- what they called buddy ratings.</span> <span id="s1884">24 guys who live with you on one floor, had to report on each other what kind of -- criticized you, or -- so you could think about your -- they called them buddy ratings.</span> <span id="s1885">And our instructor would look at them, and I was reported by quite a few of them for not going on leave on weekends, which they wanted to, because it’s very hard, the studies, and some guys cracked up, and went out -- went out of the school, they couldn’t take it, it was too -- too -- too strict, and in my case, I took leave like e-everybody else, went downtown like everybody else, but didn’t go to a movie, or didn’t date any girls.</span> <span id="s1886">I went to hotel room, and I studied.</span> <span id="s1887">So, at the time we had, like I said, a couple of people that need psychiatric treatment, because they just couldn’t take it.</span> <span id="s1888">But that’s the part of becoming an officer, th -- taking a lot of stress and th -- and to me that didn’t mean anything, I had gone through a lot more than that.</span> <span id="s1889">But I need to study.</span> <span id="s1890">I figure if I’m going to make it, I need to study.</span> <span id="s1891">Physical part was no problem.</span> <span id="s1892">So I study -- they reported me that I didn’t take it easy on weekends, that I went to a hotel room and studied.</span> <span id="s1893">On Monday the senior instructor had me in the office, and said, “You got to stop this.</span> <span id="s1894">I don’t want you [indecipherable] about it.”</span> <span id="s1895">Anyway, that was one.</span> <span id="s1896">So when I -- here we were on a stage, and I was the third one to get the bars pinned on by a general.</span> <span id="s1897">And then we had to say good-bye, salute every officer that was our instructor, were about a dozen or so from my class.</span> <span id="s1898">And the way it worked, you got your diploma, shook hands with a general, and he put the bars on rikey, and then went on to the next guy, and then went from rank to rank, lower, lower.</span> <span id="s1899">Til I got to the major who was so prejudiced.</span> <span id="s1900">And actually, I knew this, he’d tried to get me out of school, get me -- not have m -- not graduate fr-from the officer’s school.</span> <span id="s1901">And I don’t think I told the story, what -- the actual happening, what -- what -- how I found out that he was prejudiced, and that he really tried to get me, you know out of my way, out of school.</span> <span id="s1902">And this was not just me, but everybody who was Black, or Jewish, or some other foreign [indecipherable] came from foreign country, maybe, or his parents gave him [indecipherable] name.</span> <span id="s1903">He was picking on them, and tried to get them kicked out of school, including me.</span> <span id="s1904">In my case, it was another story.</span> <span id="s1905">He used my being foreign-born, and having gone through the Holocaust, by saying when -- during a coun-counseling session, “Candi-Candidate Willner, if you become an officer, and the army sends you to Germany, wouldn’t that be very bad that you hate those Germans, and you -- because they killed your parents, and your family, and wouldn’t that be very bad for the army, send you to Germany, and you would have to put up with those people, who did this?</span> <span id="s1906">You probably hate the Germans.”</span> <span id="s1907">I said, “Major, I don’t hate the Germans.</span> <span id="s1908">I -- that’s the only people are responsible for what happened, but I don’t put everybody in the same pot.</span> <span id="s1909">I -- those who have done bad things, I don’t want any part of them, but there’s Germans -- many Germans who are good.</span> <span id="s1910">Otherwise I wouldn’t be here today.”</span> <span id="s1911">“Well, I don’t understand you,” he said, “I -- I -- I -- you must hate the Germans.”</span> <span id="s1912">I said, “No, I don’t hate the Germans.</span> <span id="s1913">I am German myself, of Jewish faith, and I don’t have that problem.</span> <span id="s1914">If the army sends me to Germany, I’ll conduct myself the way is expected of me, and I immedi -- I had to keep my personal feelings to myself, in the interest of the army [indecipherable].”</span> <span id="s1915">Well, he kept on and on, digging, but he didn’t get anywhere wi-with me, and he apparently tried to talk me into saying something that I hated Germans because what happened, and therefore I would not be a good representative of the United States Army, or United States, in Germany, because my hatred.</span></p> <p><span id="s1916">Q: Did he -- did you talk to people about -- I mean, the war was over a few years, an-and you were starting to get a little bit of distance from -- from those events.</span> <span id="s1917">Did you talk to people about what had happened to you during the Holocaust, or did they ask you about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1918">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s1919">If I just take the officer candidate school, seven instructors asked me, and they even were so nice that if -- they said if you have any problems during examination time, they were si -- going around checking, see everybody was honest during examination.</span> <span id="s1920">And they even told me if you have any problems with the answers in English, write them down in French or German, we’ll figure it out.</span> <span id="s1921">The other main instructor, same rank as this prejudiced major, who asked me, counseled me, this was the highest rank in our group, major, he happened to be a war hero, who went to Korea, and was promoted twice on the battlefield.</span> <span id="s1922">Was a major, and was -- and -- and received two Silver Stars, which is a high decoration, and he knew that this guy was prejudiced, and he talked to me a couple of times.</span> <span id="s1923">And he in turn talked to a captain who also asked me, “What did he ask you?”</span> <span id="s1924">So it became known among the other instructor, this guy’s prejudiced.</span> <span id="s1925">But in my case, not in some of the other cases, they want to see me get through with this, and graduate, and they told me not to worry.</span> <span id="s1926">And knowing this, that I had everybody else behind me, I was able to go ahead, and not be intimidated, and they did a lot of things for me, to help me along.</span></p> <p><span id="s1927">Q: So you were really -- it sounds like you were really on your own, as a -- as somebody who is such a recent citizen.</span> <span id="s1928">I mean that you -- that was really unusual at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1929">A: It was unusual, it was stated also in g -- on -- on the graduation citation that I had been in a concentration camp, and that they -- I was the first one to go through.</span> <span id="s1930">There had been other foreigners may -- foreign born people, but not one who had been in a concentration camp for that long, and had escaped from a transport of -- of a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1931">And had been for years, not just short while, imprisoned.</span> <span id="s1932">And had outlived his time -- that normally was people lived, if they worked for a year, and then they went down, you know [indecipherable] and then I did this for three years, and prior to that, in the inter-internment camps in France, which were not that bad, they didn’t kill people, but some people died from hunger, and so -- and then I had escaped actually twice, once in France, but then I got caught there, and well they -- they explained all that.</span> <span id="s1933">So they were very impressed, I would say and -- and also I felt that -- that I had something tell my fellow officers, that I was a good influence to my friends and colleagues, and they saw it from a different viewpoint, they thought it was something, having been there, not hating the Germans, but that I could add something to it, which was actually true, because I was involved once in writing up a plan in Korea, for prisoners of war, not to mistreat them, because we didn’t do that, we went by the Geneva Convention, and because of my experiences, I was very sensitive to when a guy becomes a prisoner, not like I became one because I was a Jew, but to become the prisoner in the field, in -- in war time, that they are not to be mistreated, or to interrogation -- what do you call that -- tortured.</span> <span id="s1934">I was very outspoken on that, and -- which all -- is the American way, we don’t mistreat prisoners generally, and there were some exception, which also looked -- could have happened -- when I said one time that somebody asked me this could happen here.</span> <span id="s1935">I said, “Not with our -- in our democracy, but there are people -- not the country, that would do bad things if not properly supervised, officers included.”</span> <span id="s1936">To wit, Lieutenant Calley in Korea -- in Viet -- in Vietnam, who killed women and children, who went to jail for a few years, but in my opinion, that -- the case of Lieutenant Calley was that his superior officer, a captain, should have been punished more than Lieutenant Calley, because he was responsible for him, he knew what he was doing, and he should have stopped him.</span> <span id="s1937">And he should have made a supply officer, not the combat officer up front, where he could kill.</span> <span id="s1938">Give him a job where he doesn’t need his rifle.</span> <span id="s1939">And during class on how to treat prisoner of war, because the war in Korea was going on then, they gave us a case in school, which they wanted us to solve.</span> <span id="s1940">They say suppose you were in combat, and you take Chinese, or Korean prisoners.</span> <span id="s1941">And the day before you attacked, and you went in Chinese position, and some of you -- your friends got captured by the Chinese, or the Koreans.</span> <span id="s1942">And you knew that they got captured alive, and the next day you’re on the attack -- we -- we Americans are on the attack, and we overrun the Chinese position, and you find the guys they were taken prisoners the day before shot in the head, their hands bound behind them.</span> <span id="s1943">In other words, the Chinese shot the prisoners, your best friends, your comrade.</span> <span id="s1944">What would b-be your reaction?</span> <span id="s1945">Well, we had different answers.</span> <span id="s1946">When I -- came my turn, and the instructor asked me, well, somebody said we kill them, and it -- it happened actually, that they got so upset about it during combat, that when they found this -- this really happened that they got killed, with their hands bound behind their back, that our troops went wild, and they took no Chinese prisoners, they shot them.</span> <span id="s1947">Or in one case, they had a few prisoners, and the lieutenant said to the sergeant, “Take him back.”</span> <span id="s1948">Take him back was generally understood to a prisoner enclave, an enclosure to take them out of combat, and keep in a prison camp.</span> <span id="s1949">But in this particular case, this officer always said, when he said to the sergeant take him back, he meant take him behind the hill, then execute him.</span> <span id="s1950">It happened.</span> <span id="s1951">So he asked me, what would you do, this happened to your unit?</span> <span id="s1952">You find out the sergeant take these guys over the hill, and you find out -- not your order, but you find the sergeant did this on his own.</span> <span id="s1953">What would you do?</span> <span id="s1954">Let it go on?</span> <span id="s1955">And I said no.</span> <span id="s1956">I would court mar -- if -- if a b -- I would prefer charges against the sergeant after the battle, and have him court martialed.</span> <span id="s1957">“Is that -- that is the proper procedure, isn’t it,” I said, “in the United States.”</span> <span id="s1958">The instructing officer said, “That’s correct, that is our policy, but in doing this, you will destroy the fighting spirit of your troops, and you have a morale problem, because you’re stopping guys to get even with the other side, who did that.</span> <span id="s1959">And my answer would be close your eyes to it,” -- and this was not the school’s solution, this -- this was this instructor.</span> <span id="s1960">He said, “It’s my -- my solution, not the school’s solution.</span> <span id="s1961">And if you court martial a guy after the battle is over, your -- your -- the rest of your troops probably won’t fight the way they’re supposed to, because you’re doing something against your own people.”</span> <span id="s1962">I say, “I’m sorry, but we fight by the rules of the c -- Geneva convention, which are very humane, and a prisoner is supposed to be taken back and put into an enclosure.</span> <span id="s1963">When the war is finished, he’s released.”</span> <span id="s1964">And if I have a problem with the morale of the troops, my job would be that after the battle is over -- during the battle you can’t do anything, you’re in the heat of the battle.</span> <span id="s1965">You can’t say that shooting’s [indecipherable] stop this, or because you don’t -- we don’t do this.</span> <span id="s1966">But after the battle is over, the next day or something, after everybody already calmed down, say, “Well, this what I witnessed yesterday.</span> <span id="s1967">This not the way we fight a war, we don’t execute prisoners, and I don’t want to see this happen again.”</span> <span id="s1968">Not threaten -- threaten him with a court martial, but just imply that you will take stern action if this [indecipherable] our side does it.</span> <span id="s1969">And I finished up saying this discussion back and forth, they were back and forth.</span> <span id="s1970">I say, “If we do this, we’re not better than they are, even that’s revenge.</span> <span id="s1971">And you don’t do -- you don’t kill a prisoner.”</span> <span id="s1972">So that [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1973">Q: When were you -- when were you in officer’s school?</span> <span id="s1974">Was that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1975">A: This was in 1952.</span></p> <p><span id="s1976">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1977">A: I graduated on my birthday, 15 August, 1952.</span> <span id="s1978">The war was going on in Korea then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1979">Q: And did you go to Korea after you graduated?</span> <span id="s1980">What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1981">A: I was a lucky guy, yes I did.</span> <span id="s1982">But the Korean [indecipherable] was coming the finish the war, they gave up.</span> <span id="s1983">No, I’m kidding.</span> <span id="s1984">I got there at the end of the war.</span> <span id="s1985">I didn’t have to fight anyone.</span> <span id="s1986">But my instructors told me if I don’t graduate from officer candidate school, they will send me to Korea everybody else, and they have -- they would think that I would get a battlefield commission, having gone through the other thing.</span> <span id="s1987">And I said, “Don’t do me any favors.</span> <span id="s1988">I fought enough in my lifetime.</span> <span id="s1989">If I have to go, I go, I do my job.</span> <span id="s1990">But I don’t want to become an officer by being courageous, or getting a medal, and post -- posthumously.</span> <span id="s1991">After I went through this in Germany, I -- I don’t need to die on a battlefield here.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1992">Q: Was it hard at all for you to be known as this -- this survivor, among your fellow officer candidate?</span></p> <p><span id="s1993">A: No, on the contr -- on the contrary.</span> <span id="s1994">They are very understanding, they ask me a lot of questions.</span> <span id="s1995">My roommate was a guy of Italian descent, this guy [indecipherable] and he also change his name from an Italian name to -- his name was Nash, and he -- we compliment -- compliment each other, and a lot of time discuss things.</span> <span id="s1996">He was a great guy.</span> <span id="s1997">And I had no problem being a -- I like to finish up by saying this thing.</span> <span id="s1998">This major, who tried to get me out of school, was not -- wasn’t able to do this all the time.</span> <span id="s1999">I -- I’m sure he was stopped after this case, my case, which became more of less, not public, but the officers talked among them and say this guy shouldn’t be able to do that.</span> <span id="s2000">Or I’m sure there were actually three majors, and the others were lower ranking, and two majors were for me, and just this one guy against.</span> <span id="s2001">And the two majors were for me were -- one was like I said, a war hero, and a -- and the other was a very fine gentleman too, and they -- they ask me sometimes some questions, but not in detail, and they thought I was an asset.</span> <span id="s2002">So anyway, at -- at graduation they were all lined up, and I stepped down when I had my bars on, and you said good-bye to each one of the officers who were your instructors, and -- and saluted.</span> <span id="s2003">And you were in the military, where you turned right, and formed a line.</span> <span id="s2004">You salute, you shook hands, turn right again, turn left again in front of the next guy, about a dozen guys, and here was my major who [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2005">I made two steps instead of one step, and I stepped past him.</span> <span id="s2006">I didn’t salute him, and I didn’t shake hands, or say anything to him.</span> <span id="s2007">And I know that a lot of people watching, a lot of people knew my dislike -- or his dislike, that we had a problem, but that I -- and I figured I was a -- an commissioned officer now, although I was inferior to him, he -- that I was -- I wanted to do that, I really -- I had planned this, I -- I didn’t just do that on the spur of the moment.</span> <span id="s2008">I said I’m not going to salute.</span> <span id="s2009">On the outside, I salute him, it’s required, but here -- I won’t make an issue out of it.</span> <span id="s2010">And nobody’s going to say anything during a big ceremony.</span> <span id="s2011">We had a couple hundred people there.</span> <span id="s2012">And particularly since I was cited [indecipherable] stage.</span> <span id="s2013">And I’m sure the general didn’t know about it.</span> <span id="s2014">He might have asking question afterwards, why didn’t this lieutenant salute, or -- but they were too preoccupied with things there.</span> <span id="s2015">And -- so I figured well, everybody saw this, and the people that knew about it, they wonder what happened once the doors open, everybody was free to go, this guy would come after me and tell me that was a bad thing.</span> <span id="s2016">Some guys came over to me and said, “Boy, I take my hat off for you.</span> <span id="s2017">I know what’s going on.”</span> <span id="s2018">And I said -- he never came to me, and he let me go.</span> <span id="s2019">And I figure if he does, then he will make case of it, but otherwise he -- maybe you’ve taught this lesson.</span> <span id="s2020">And I always hoped that in the milikin -- military career I would run across him so I could really tell him off.</span> <span id="s2021">I never did.</span> <span id="s2022">I don’t know what happened to him, I don’t -- so that was then.</span> <span id="s2023">Can we stop for a minute?</span></p> <p><span id="s2024">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2025">After s -- what happened after you graduated then?</span> <span id="s2026">You went to Korea just briefly?</span></p> <p><span id="s2027">A: No, I didn’t go to Korea, I went to -- everyone went to a specialized school after you become a second lieutenant.</span> <span id="s2028">You go to -- this was an infantry officer’s school, that was your basic instruction, whereas other guys went to F-Fort Knox, if they wanted to be in tanks.</span> <span id="s2029">They would then be tank officers.</span> <span id="s2030">And there was another school to become an artillery officer, and one more to be -- infantry, artillery, tanks, and -- yeah, that was it.</span> <span id="s2031">Oh yeah, and -- and th-the four -- and the other branch was branch [indecipherable], you were assigned to a branch afterward.</span> <span id="s2032">You could be assigned to a branch right away, then you went to your branch school to be specialized.</span> <span id="s2033">You were an ordinance officer, which meant repairing tanks or guns.</span> <span id="s2034">You went to the ordinance school at -- it’s outside Washingham.</span> <span id="s2035">In my case, I was trained as a combat infantry officer, but I wasn’t specialized as such.</span> <span id="s2036">I -- I -- my desire was to go into Intelligence because I spoke languages, and had served with [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2037">So my desire was really to catch spies, people who were stealing our secrets, in this case the Russians were good at that, and our side had to find out who these people were to catch them.</span> <span id="s2038">And that was the intent, that was my plan, to be a counter-Intelligence officer.</span> <span id="s2039">But that’s not what you become right away in the army, you become an Intelligence officer, period.</span> <span id="s2040">You do first Intelligence work.</span> <span id="s2041">Not secretly maybe, and sit in the staff, or in an office.</span> <span id="s2042">And so that’s what I intended to be.</span> <span id="s2043">And I went for six months then, to two schools -- actually eight months.</span> <span id="s2044">No, six and a half -- six and a half months.</span> <span id="s2045">I went to Fort Lee, Virginia, and I wound up at a course in there I had not intended to take.</span> <span id="s2046">The last course I took was aerially -- a-aerially supply.</span> <span id="s2047">Aerially supply meant for the paratroopers who come -- some out of airplanes, but not that.</span> <span id="s2048">But to -- we supply these guys by air, too.</span> <span id="s2049">Somebody was surrounded in a battle, like it happened in World War two.</span> <span id="s2050">They needed guns, ammunition, first aid, doctors, so they would have to jump over an area where these guys were surrounded, and therefore you needed aerially supplied.</span> <span id="s2051">So I took that course, and what it amounted to is jet plane that could be opened up from the rear -- by the rear door, not on the side, and supplies were stacked up in the plane, and you had to shove them out.</span> <span id="s2052">And they either came down by parachute over a target, or the plane flew -- flew so low, just above ground, like a couple of feet, and would had to be a skillful pilot, and these -- aerially supply officer would be inside the plane to see to it that it got pushed out on time, over the target, not over the enemies side, that he would get our supplies, and so I took that course.</span> <span id="s2053">When I was finished [indecipherable] I wanted to go to Germany.</span> <span id="s2054">I was called to an office in the Pentagon, and there was an officer of Chinese ancestry.</span> <span id="s2055">He was civilian Intelligence officer, he turned out to be a former aide de camp of General Wainwright, who was the -- we called Vinegar Joe, who fought in Asia during World War two.</span> <span id="s2056">And very famous, he was in charge there.</span> <span id="s2057">And this guy that talked to me in the Pentagon was his aide, Chinese American.</span> <span id="s2058">He was aide during World War two, and he spoke Chinese, and he was at the young age of 27, a lieutenant colonel, because a general’s aide.</span> <span id="s2059">And when I met him, he was civilian Intelligence officer working for the army, and he was my sponsor, if you like.</span> <span id="s2060">And they wanted me to go to Korea.</span> <span id="s2061">Of course, that’s where the action was at that time, and I told him that I would like to go to Germany, because I know the language, and he said to me that, “Oh, you’re not married now, and every officer has to go initially to Korea.”</span> <span id="s2062">The war was still going on, we didn’t know when it was going to be finished.</span> <span id="s2063">“And it’s better to go now while you’re not married, because you may be thinking about getting married, and then you have to leave your wife at home for a year.</span> <span id="s2064">But go now while you’re single, have a good time, if you’re not in combat.”</span> <span id="s2065">And I said, “Okay.”</span> <span id="s2066">He said he’ll guarantee me that I go to Germany wh -- after I come back from Korea.</span> <span id="s2067">I’m glad I took his advice.</span> <span id="s2068">I could have insisted I go Germany, when -- talk to somebody else and -- but he appreciate I didn’t go over his head, and made a big thing out of it.</span> <span id="s2069">I went to Korea, and he saw to it that I got a position in Korea which was -- called for an officer with th-two grades higher than I was, a major -- End of Tape Five, Side A Beginning Tape Five, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s2070">A: -- went on a troopship, and on the troopship to go into Korea, we went first to Okinawa, and I was given a job on the ships as a -- being a compartment commander, and the troops sleep on the troopship four -- four beds high, o-one on top of another, filled with people.</span> <span id="s2071">We had a lot of problems, guys getting seasick, including myself, but -- and messing up the place, and then other people get sick, well, I took some action by having -- having teams go topside, get fresh air, go down and change -- put another [indecipherable] and I kept my place very clean.</span> <span id="s2072">And I got commended by the top guy there, and well, wh-when I arrived in Korea, I -- I was given a letter of recommendation -- I forget i -- I’m a very -- what’d they say, a very active, or -- I wa -- I was an action officer, what they -- one --not just sits by and watches.</span> <span id="s2073">So anyway, it was a go -- I -- I came there, bu -- good thing -- also I had my dog on board, which was illegal by the army.</span> <span id="s2074">The army said no pets to Korea.</span> <span id="s2075">And I didn’t have anybody, no parents, no -- and I didn’t know what to do with my dog, I -- somebody advised me, “Take him to Seattle, to the port, see the captain of the ship, of the troop transport, because he is navy, you are army.</span> <span id="s2076">The army told you no pets to Korea, but the navy might think different.</span> <span id="s2077">And you -- if the navy gives you permission, the ships under -- under navy control.</span> <span id="s2078">Maybe you’ll find a captain that’s sympa --.”</span> <span id="s2079">And I was lucky, I went to Seattle two days ahead of time with my dog.</span> <span id="s2080">I went up to the ship, I knew the ship I was going to sail on.</span> <span id="s2081">Saw the captain of the ship, and I said, “Captain, I have a dog that I feel very strong about, and I wa-want to take to Korea.</span> <span id="s2082">But the army has regulations that say no, you can’t take any pets to Korea.”</span> <span id="s2083">He said, “That’s the army.”</span> <span id="s2084">Just like somebody from -- “I don’t give a damn about army regulations.</span> <span id="s2085">The ship is -- I’m the captain, I’m [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2086">You want to bring your dog on board, bring him on board.</span> <span id="s2087">But bring him one day before troops come on board.”</span> <span id="s2088">I did.</span> <span id="s2089">I was lucky, I’d prefabricated a dog house which could be taken apart in no time, just a couple of screws.</span> <span id="s2090">I came on board, the captain al -- sees me, gave me a corner for my dog.</span> <span id="s2091">And I brought my dog into Korea.</span> <span id="s2092">I had [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s2093">Q: When did you get -- just a little sideline, but when did you get your first dog after the war, and what made you decide to do it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2094">A: What -- I won -- I won’t say a long story, but I -- I was lonely.</span> <span id="s2095">No parents, no wife.</span> <span id="s2096">That actually is a thing I really didn’t talk about because it’s too long, and too -- too involved, and very personal, I think, it -- what one goes through when you’re lonely, or when you have everybody killed in the family.</span> <span id="s2097">And I was just like -- the dog to me was like a member of the family, and there were two things that I did to remain sane, actually, and to -- not to -- I couldn’t stay behind closed doors was one thing.</span> <span id="s2098">I all -- I -- even today I leave the doors open in my house.</span> <span id="s2099">I go to the toilet, I don’t close the door if it’s just my family that’s in the house -- not when there are other people, because I don’t like closed doors.</span> <span id="s2100">And I didn’t like that before, and I just -- I -- I -- in the camps, you always had comas, people who were the same boat, and my whole story with Michael Swab is the same thing.</span> <span id="s2101">I had a buddy, I had somebody who -- who felt like I did.</span> <span id="s2102">And when I was in the army then as an officer, it’s sometimes lonely, because you are maybe the only officer, and you are with the men, but they’re not on an equal level with you, you still lonely.</span> <span id="s2103">So I wung -- wasn’t going to do that.</span> <span id="s2104">I said, well, even my first sergeant was a man 20 years older than myself.</span> <span id="s2105">When we were in private together, I ask him to call me by my first name, not say Lieutenant Willner, or sir -- he’s 20 years older.</span> <span id="s2106">So I made up for some of this loneliness by doing certain things, and the other thing that they didn’t talk about was having girlfriends.</span> <span id="s2107">I got involved with other women.</span> <span id="s2108">I was lonely.</span> <span id="s2109">And I also, since I was -- since my liberation, I -- I wanted to get married, but I knew I didn’t have an education, I didn’t have a job, or -- in the re -- once I was in the army, I figured, well, a lieutenant doesn’t make much money, but I’ll wait til I’ll be a captain or so.</span> <span id="s2110">But I wanted to get married, and have children.</span> <span id="s2111">And I -- there was part, getting married fast, not to be lonely any more.</span> <span id="s2112">But I said to myself, I must find the right woman, because be very difficult to be married to a concentration camp survivor.</span> <span id="s2113">You have your idiosyncrasies, maybe.</span> <span id="s2114">But other people have too, who were -- who were not in camp, but there are certain things that we do have.</span> <span id="s2115">I’m aware -- I’m aware of it.</span> <span id="s2116">Some people don’t know it, my f -- my best friend, Michael Swab, his whole life, whenever he was with me, or alone, walking the street, he look -- he look over his shoulder.</span> <span id="s2117">He did this all the time, even after he got married, because he always thought some Gestapo or somebody was following him, that he was being -- so, that was a problem he had, not -- not a big problem, but so I observed him one time doing that.</span> <span id="s2118">And some people had, like I said, idiosyncrasies.</span> <span id="s2119">They also had -- think they are very bad.</span> <span id="s2120">I must al -- also say that, since I was very close to Michael Swab, that he beat his second wife.</span> <span id="s2121">And she told me one time, when she was -- when they were visiting here, and I -- I was really shook up, and so I decided -- I told my wife, and she said she knows, and thought that was terrible.</span> <span id="s2122">When you got upset about something, instead of arguing with wife -- I argue with my wife, but then we clear it up before the end of the day, if it’s not cleared up right away.</span> <span id="s2123">But he beat his wife, so he was -- some of the real bad things from the camps, he took with him, and he applied it to -- so I -- I couldn’t -- this was terrible.</span> <span id="s2124">I decided I will go with him under false pretense and talk to him about it, very seriously.</span> <span id="s2125">Because we had no secrets for each other.</span> <span id="s2126">And I took him to the Potomac River, near -- in a secluded area, nice day.</span> <span id="s2127">I said, “Michael, I got you up here because I want to talk to you.</span> <span id="s2128">I don’t want anybody around.</span> <span id="s2129">And I want to tell -- to tell you -- you beat your wife.”</span> <span id="s2130">I had to be careful because he -- he would know that she told me or my wife, and that he’ll beat up again.</span> <span id="s2131">“I -- I-I -- and this I-I cannot be quiet about.</span> <span id="s2132">And you know, we’ve always been very truthful to each other, and that is not a thing that I -- that you should do.</span> <span id="s2133">There’s no excuse for it.</span> <span id="s2134">Absolutely none, you ca -- tell me anything you want, but I-I will not accept it.</span> <span id="s2135">You don’t beat your wife, you don’t beat women, and I don’t have to tell you why not, you don’t do.”</span> <span id="s2136">He never said one word.</span> <span id="s2137">He didn’t say yes, no, or it’s none of your business, which he wouldn’t have said.</span> <span id="s2138">And that was it.</span> <span id="s2139">So anyway, my loneliness -- oh yeah, finding [indecipherable] wife.</span> <span id="s2140">After I was 19, and out, every woman I went out with, or I was intimate with, I always considered, not marrying her, but what am I looking for besides sex?</span> <span id="s2141">She had to have certain qualities that -- maybe more qualities because I went through the camps, but particularly because I went through the camps.</span> <span id="s2142">Have [indecipherable] and I start making up a list.</span> <span id="s2143">Get organized was always m-my way of doing things.</span> <span id="s2144">And I wind up with good point and the bad points, what I want to see.</span> <span id="s2145">And I gave each question a point, and when I came up with more good points than bad points, I -- would she be a good wife?</span> <span id="s2146">But it was just still a little game I was playing with myself, but I didn’t ge -- consulted anybody else, but -- but needless to say, but I -- I -- I did get involved with quite a few girls, and didn’t make any difference what religion, or -- I did have one thing I do want to mention.</span> <span id="s2147">I was a-always very fond of the French language, and everybody would have bet that I’ll marry a French woman, so I could sp-speak French all the time.</span> <span id="s2148">And I -- I thought so, too [indecipherable] my ol -- my oldest son just went to -- they had the 50 anniversary of the Normandy invasion in Europe.</span> <span id="s2149">He and another officer went to France, and took some pictures there on the beaches there where we landed.</span> <span id="s2150">And they still have some tank obstacles there.</span> <span id="s2151">And I had to laugh, because he visited that, he took pictures, and I said, “I was there, too.”</span> <span id="s2152">He said, “I know where you were at that time.”</span> <span id="s2153">He knows exactly where I was.</span> <span id="s2154">“No,” I said, “another time I was there, not during the invasion.”</span> <span id="s2155">When I was in the army, as a criminal investigator, I had a case, which took me to Karankan, France, which is right behind the beaches where we landed during the invasion.</span> <span id="s2156">And my son [indecipherable] Karankan, but when I was there I met a French girl, and I stayed with her for a couple of days, and then I said, the same time I visit the beaches, and I have a picture with her standing next to the tank obstruction.</span> <span id="s2157">They’re not -- they’re not bodies any more, but there are certain things that you can still see why -- what we encountered there.</span> <span id="s2158">And -- and on the back it said the place, and the year, the -- and he said [indecipherable] the same place, but not like you probably.</span> <span id="s2159">So, what I’m trying to say is that I -- I was never alone by doing this, and I came -- I never came -- oh, I was engaged once, to a Jewish girl from Detroit, because I went to the chapel, to Jewish services here -- the military chapel, and I met this man, and he introduced me to his niece, who was visiting from Detroit.</span> <span id="s2160">She had just graduated from high school, she’s very cute, and I started dating her a couple a -- they wanted me to date her.</span> <span id="s2161">I was 26 when I graduate from officer’s school, and the average age was 22, guys who [indecipherable] from college.</span> <span id="s2162">I was a little bit older than the rest of them, also a little maturer.</span> <span id="s2163">But I dated her, and I got seriously thinking about marrying her.</span> <span id="s2164">I introduced her to my relatives in New York, and I -- the one who was against German, the daughter I’d mentioned before, that she lectured me I shouldn’t marry a German, and I didn’t tell the rest of the story, I just will -- didn’t want to [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2165">I -- I was going to break off my alle -- my -- with my cousin, you know, but my wife came to New York to get her citizenship, three weeks after we got married, she met my cousin, and my cousin fell in love with her.</span> <span id="s2166">She loved her, and the -- the one [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2167">Q: The same cousin who had said -- uh-huh -- said don’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s2168">A: Marry a German.</span></p> <p><span id="s2169">Q: -- marry a German.</span> <span id="s2170">Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2171">A: And I was going to break up with her [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2172">Well, that was okay.</span> <span id="s2173">So she met her, and there were no more problems.</span> <span id="s2174">My wife still talked to her, and din -- din -- she didn’t throw it up.</span> <span id="s2175">And -- so back to -- to a girl I got engaged to.</span> <span id="s2176">She was okay, her family was okay in New Jersey, but then I was supposed to meet her parents -- excuse me -- in -- in Detroit, and I went there, and I had just graduated from officer’s school, I was very proud to have made it, and to have a career maybe, ahead of me, and to have succeeded, and all that stuff, okay.</span> <span id="s2177">So -- also I -- I probably looked pretty good in uniform as an officer at the time.</span> <span id="s2178">And so she was impressed, probably, but I found out she was okay, but maybe too immature, just graduated from high school, and I was very mature.</span> <span id="s2179">I could have handled it, but could she handle it, a difficult guy like me?</span> <span id="s2180">No, but -- I wasn’t difficult, but I -- I did have certain things I -- I -- the thing came a-abo-about in a way that I did not expect it to break off our engagement, but it was the right thing, I was lucky.</span> <span id="s2181">When I visited her parents, they approved of me, and the father took me aside, say goodnight, and said to me, “You -- you are going to Korea I understand.”</span> <span id="s2182">I -- I -- I expected to be ordered to Korea, I didn’t know yet for sure.</span> <span id="s2183">I said, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s2184">He said, “What -- what do you want to be, a defender of capitalism?”</span> <span id="s2185">And he talked to me in the way a Communist was talk -- would talk.</span> <span id="s2186">And he was entitled to his opinion, but that was my country, I had went through hard times getting there, and I -- what he basically said that I shouldn’t be an officer of an im-imperialist army.</span> <span id="s2187">And I said, “I’m not going to give up my career be that I’ve practically fought for it,” I went -- so I told him that I was not going to leave the army, and I could also called it I’m a defender of a democracy.</span> <span id="s2188">And I didn’t argue with him, but just discuss it.</span> <span id="s2189">But those were his words, actually, defender of capitalism.</span> <span id="s2190">So I said to myself afterwards, I’ve nothing against the girl, nothing against her parents as people, but this bother me.</span> <span id="s2191">So knowing that I would be going to Korea, I said to myself, under normal circumstances, if I’m married, and going to Korea, my wife, if I have no children, would either go back to her parents, or probably to my parent’s house, and live with them til I come back from Korea, and then we have a house, or su -- apartment.</span> <span id="s2192">So I said, well, I don’t have parents.</span> <span id="s2193">I don’t have anybody.</span> <span id="s2194">She will be with her parents while I’m in Korea, and every day she’ll hear from her father, “What kind of life is this?</span> <span id="s2195">Your husbands the other end of the world, you’re here, and he’s defending imperialism th -- over there in Korea.”</span> <span id="s2196">And before I know it, before I get back after a year, I have a divorce on my hands.</span> <span id="s2197">I said, “I’m not going to get married.”</span> <span id="s2198">This -- she -- she going to be under influence of her parents.</span> <span id="s2199">She’s young.</span> <span id="s2200">If she had made up her own mind, be a different story.</span> <span id="s2201">If she’d [indecipherable] living with a girlfriend, but her intention was to stay on with her parents.</span> <span id="s2202">And I think she’ll be hearing this all the time.</span> <span id="s2203">I’m not going to start -- I want to get married once, and [indecipherable] and not get divorced.</span> <span id="s2204">So she had to be the right woman, and I felt she wasn’t the right one, so I broke it off.</span> <span id="s2205">I felt very bad about it, and my aunt told me -- this woman who was against the marriage, “Well Eddie, it’s better to feel bad for a couple of months, than feeling bad the rest of your life.”</span> <span id="s2206">And I agreed with her.</span> <span id="s2207">I went to Korea, but I had, shortly before Korea -- well, this really doesn’t matter, I met another woman, and I’m mentioning this not just to mention I went out with women, but that I -- the specific circumstance.</span> <span id="s2208">I -- when I went to Germany one time [indecipherable] the first time, as an enlisted man, I went to criminal investigation school, I mentioned that.</span> <span id="s2209">And on the train I met a British girl, who was traveling with her mother from England to southern Germany.</span> <span id="s2210">And I got to talk to her, and she said her mother was Jewish.</span> <span id="s2211">So she was half Jewish, and that her father had divorced the mother under the nur -- Nuremberg laws.</span> <span id="s2212">And -- but he wasn’t a Nazi, but he took advantage of the Nuremberg laws.</span> <span id="s2213">And he left Germany, too, he went to South America someplace, with the two boys.</span> <span id="s2214">And he left the mother and the daughter in Germany, they got a -- they got to England.</span> <span id="s2215">So when I met th-the mother, I was re-visiting friends, and I didn’t know that her daughter who was traveling there, was married at that time.</span> <span id="s2216">I didn’t expect a woman, traveling with her mother, that she was married.</span> <span id="s2217">She never told me about it, and she came to visit me at the school on weekends.</span> <span id="s2218">That was near Munich, Germany.</span> <span id="s2219">I got involved with her, and -- and when I went to Korea, she told me -- she asked me what I was going to do, I said, “Well, I have four weeks of vacation.</span> <span id="s2220">Since I’m not engaged any more, I don’t have any plans.”</span> <span id="s2221">She said -- and I still didn’t know she was married at the time.</span> <span id="s2222">She said, “If you would come visit me.”</span> <span id="s2223">I said yes.</span> <span id="s2224">She, I think, took four weeks.</span> <span id="s2225">We got [indecipherable] around the [indecipherable] and couple other places, and then she told me she was married, but that she’s going to divorce her husband.</span> <span id="s2226">And we had not talked about marriage, she and I, we just -- and to me it was another attraction.</span> <span id="s2227">I -- I had -- not going to say that her on my list of prospective future wife, particularly just -- she was married, too.</span> <span id="s2228">And I had no intention go out with a married woman, or -- because my time was valuable, and I figured a married woman, that’s probably just for sex.</span> <span id="s2229">But some ba -- maybe I’ll marry her, maybe not.</span> <span id="s2230">Not her -- not the British girl.</span> <span id="s2231">So we were together four weeks, and I s -- said at the end of four weeks, “Don’t wait for me to come back from Korea, even if you get divorced, I’m not going to marry you.”</span> <span id="s2232">Because it was her intention would get to know me better, and I thought -- I never thought one moment I would marry her.</span> <span id="s2233">And there was nothing wrong with her, except whatever the problem was between her husband, she told me what it was.</span> <span id="s2234">And so I knew from the beginning I was just spending -- having a good time, and she was having a good time.</span> <span id="s2235">So, when we left on last day, we said good-bye for good, and I was on my way to Korea -- after a couple of days, she asked me, in England, if you -- you can only get a divorce, which she still wanted to get, if you commit adultery -- you admit to adultery.</span> <span id="s2236">And when she talked about adultery, I said, “Well, in my book, my dictionary, it said adultery is two wrong people doing a right thing.”</span> <span id="s2237">And -- and so I tried to keep -- keep a happy atmosphere, you know?</span> <span id="s2238">To her it was just good-bye for good.</span> <span id="s2239">Well, to me, too, but it was no -- no problem for me.</span> <span id="s2240">She had still hopes that I would -- she was going to divorce her husband, maybe I’ll be interested.</span> <span id="s2241">She -- so she went back to England, I went to Korea.</span> <span id="s2242">All of a sudden -- well, she asked me if I would help her in -- in her divorce, because she can onl -- if she admits adultery in court, then she can divorce.</span> <span id="s2243">But I figure I’m single, I have no problem.</span> <span id="s2244">I have no wife -- adultery, not that I say it’s okay, but she committed adultery, but I didn’t [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2245">I said, “Sure, you can -- if that helps.”</span> <span id="s2246">And I was in Korea, I got a letter from the British court, from a judge, that she swore in court that she committed adultery with me, and they want to know whether it was true or not.</span> <span id="s2247">And I found myself in a situation in Korea, I said -- I didn’t think that far.</span> <span id="s2248">An officer in the United States army, you’re not supposed to commit adultery.</span> <span id="s2249">An officer and a gentleman, they always put that gentleman in there.</span> <span id="s2250">You know, a gentleman in my book is a man who di -- who’ll defend a woman from any man but himself, that’s a gentleman.</span> <span id="s2251">But so I -- I was in -- I -- what do you call that, in a -- I couldn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s2252">Q: Bind.</span></p> <p><span id="s2253">A: In a bind.</span> <span id="s2254">So I say, if I don’t answer the letter, they going to write to the Pentagon in Washington, trying to find Lieutenant Willner, and they’ll write what it’s all about.</span> <span id="s2255">It’s a question adultery, and then the army’s going to question me.</span> <span id="s2256">And I’m not doing the right thing, they’re going to kick me out.</span> <span id="s2257">So what do I do?</span> <span id="s2258">I had two sleepless nights in Korea, and it came to me all of a sudden.</span> <span id="s2259">I said, I must answer this letter, but I will not admit to adultery, because the army [indecipherable] they were very strong on that at that time, not -- not -- now it happens all the time, guys get with their fellow officers of lower ranking, and used to read in the papers, generals get kicked out, and so it was much more serious than now, now it’s -- okay, so anyway -- but I cannot say I didn’t, because she swore in court that she did.</span> <span id="s2260">I’ll call her a liar, which she wasn’t, she was telling the truth.</span> <span id="s2261">And I wouldn’t tell a lie.</span> <span id="s2262">So I sent a one sentence letter to the British court, I said, “I will neither deny nor admit it.”</span> <span id="s2263">That puts her in the clear, and I didn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s2264">If the army comes [indecipherable] end of it.</span> <span id="s2265">So that just on the sideline.</span> <span id="s2266">We go further.</span> <span id="s2267">When I came from -- back from Korea, and I was in -- actually, before moving to Japan, I was on teedeewhy, in Japan, on temporary duty, because the war is finished, and we didn’t have anything to do.</span> <span id="s2268">I had my men, they were bored.</span> <span id="s2269">I studied the countryside in Korea a little bit, and I went to Tokyo, I was ordered to Tokyo to take care of some small job, and I was one day -- this very funny.</span> <span id="s2270">I was one day in the men’s room, doing my business, and a general was standing next to me doing his business, and he said, “Oh, you -- you are Lieutenant Willner.”</span> <span id="s2271">I said, “Yeah.”</span> <span id="s2272">He saw my red name tags on.</span> <span id="s2273">“Well, when you finish, stop by my office.”</span> <span id="s2274">I had gone to officer candidate school with his son, who was not going to be a professional officer, but as a favor to his father, he became an officer -- a reserve officer.</span> <span id="s2275">And his -- I had met him once before, with his son, who took me home with him, and -- so I thought he wanted to chat about his son, or what we doing -- or we done since [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2276">So what he said, “You were here in Tokyo once before from Korea.</span> <span id="s2277">What for?”</span> <span id="s2278">“Well,” I said, “they have some stuff to be -- files to clean out [indecipherable], and we didn’t have anything to do in Korea, the war is finished.”</span> <span id="s2279">“Well,” he said, “the army’s spending a lot of money having you -- you and a couple of guys come to Japan and take care of -- why don’t we transfer you over here, and you do it here?</span> <span id="s2280">Because eventually bi -- in Korea we have less and less troops, the war is finished.”</span> <span id="s2281">I said, “General, that’s nice, but my plan is to pick up an education, I like education to remain active as an officer, and I want to go back to the States from Korea directly, and then enroll in some courses, night courses, or whatever.</span> <span id="s2282">And I wanted to go to Washington.”</span> <span id="s2283">“Well,” he said, “let’s do first things first.”</span> <span id="s2284">“Also, if I go to Japan, I must stay much longer.</span> <span id="s2285">Here, my year is finished, I go back.”</span> <span id="s2286">The rules were that you stayed two years in a place where there’s no war.</span> <span id="s2287">[indecipherable] go to Korea for [indecipherable] one ma -- one year ago, yeah, and then -- actually it was nine mon -- nine months there, in Japan.</span> <span id="s2288">So they said, “Okay, we’ll give you a special deal.</span> <span id="s2289">You talk to my deputy, and we’ll transfer your unit to -- to Japan.</span> <span id="s2290">And I’ll --.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2291">Q: Maybe we should continue on the next tape, cause we’re about to get cut off.</span></p> <p><span id="s2292">End of Tape Five, Side B Beginning Tape Six, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s2293">A: I went with my unit to Japan, and everybody was very happy, including myself, because I wanted to get to know Japan, and I knew I didn’t have to stay for two years in Japan.</span> <span id="s2294">So I stayed nine months in Japan, def -- s -- fixed up my papers saying that they agree that I should pick up some courses, that wasn’t -- Japan wasn’t the place [indecipherable] might be, and I should then go back, which I did.</span> <span id="s2295">And I -- and I had nine wonderful months in Japan, in Tokyo.</span> <span id="s2296">And I transferred back to United States, to Washington.</span> <span id="s2297">I was assigned to -- as an assistant to the commandant of the command management school at Fort Belwah, which is right outside Washington.</span> <span id="s2298">And I was living at Fort Meyer.</span> <span id="s2299">Fort Meyer is -- was very nice.</span> <span id="s2300">That was just for living purposes for me, and I commuted every day to Fort Belwah.</span> <span id="s2301">One year after that, I was assigned to Heidelberg, Germany, to the headquarter of the U.S. Army, Europe, where I had been before as an enlisted man, a criminal investigator, and now I came back as an officer.</span> <span id="s2302">And I knew the place, I liked the place.</span> <span id="s2303">Heidelberg is a very romantic place, very beautiful.</span> <span id="s2304">The Nekile river flows, there’s an old castle there, and the Americans always picked a nice place to put up their headquarters.</span> <span id="s2305">It was in a bombed out, very romantical.</span> <span id="s2306">And there was a university there.</span> <span id="s2307">It was a famous place, and also good to be stationed.</span> <span id="s2308">So I was assigned there as chief of the analiss section for technical Intelligence.</span> <span id="s2309">It was a staff officer’s jo -- assignment, and -- which was good for my record, and my boss was an Italian American, lieutenant colonel, whom I got along with very well, but actually, I found out when I -- shortly before going to Germany, that I was supposed to go to Berlin.</span> <span id="s2310">And I got this letter from this colonel, and it said, “Due to unso -- foreseen circumstances, you are coming to my headquarters in Heidelberg.”</span> <span id="s2311">And I didn’t mind.</span> <span id="s2312">Berlin would have been okay with me, too.</span> <span id="s2313">And my old friend George Strauss was there already, and it would have been interesting in that we were -- would have been -- he -- he already was, George Strauss, a detachment commander, which means you are your own boss, you have so many men, and you direct the unit.</span> <span id="s2314">It’s very much in demand in the army to get ahead, to be the commander of a unit, which I was going to be, but when I went to Heidelberg, I was a staff officer, not a commander of a unit.</span> <span id="s2315">But that was okay, too.</span> <span id="s2316">I got into a position where I had a little bit of supervision.</span> <span id="s2317">My boss had supervision over my friend George Strauss.</span> <span id="s2318">But my boss, Colonel Skolie, was retiring pretty soon from the army, and he didn’t care any more about what’s going on, he didn’t want to be bothered, un there was something bad going on, and he always told me, “Willner, you take care of it.”</span> <span id="s2319">And I would call j -- my friend George Strauss in Berlin, and say, the colonel said to do this or do that.</span> <span id="s2320">He never did, he left it up to me to s -- act in his name.</span> <span id="s2321">And it was a good arrangement, and I liked it, and George Strauss didn’t know that -- I told him afterwards, I said, “The colonel never said any such thing, I was making these up.”</span> <span id="s2322">And he was m -- ma -- it was okay with him.</span> <span id="s2323">And so, after I got assigned to Heidelberg, to Colonel Skolie, he had a habit of going every morning for coffee to the officer’s club at 10 o’clock, and he asked me to come along with him.</span> <span id="s2324">And we sat down, had our cup of coffee [indecipherable] was little bit of exercise, since always sitting behind a desk, and then -- so Colonel Skolie, the first two weeks, he was watching me like a hawk while drinking coffee.</span> <span id="s2325">And I looked around the young women, and he said [indecipherable] to me, “Well, you probably noticed that I watch you.”</span> <span id="s2326">I said, “Yes, I did.”</span> <span id="s2327">“Well, there’s a reason for it.</span> <span id="s2328">The guy you are replacing, we had to get rid of him, he was kicked out of the army.</span> <span id="s2329">He turned out to be a homosexual officer, and he got caught in something.</span> <span id="s2330">That’s why you were changed from Berlin, to -- to replace him here in my headquarters.</span> <span id="s2331">And I’m very much pleased that you are interested in girls.”</span> <span id="s2332">So he -- he was afraid he gets another guy who was a homosexual.</span> <span id="s2333">It was not very common, but it -- it did happen.</span> <span id="s2334">So Colonel Skolie had -- once before in his career had another homosexual.</span> <span id="s2335">He was afraid himself that someone might think he might be ac/dc, that the army is going to check him.</span> <span id="s2336">But he wasn’t, he was a Catholic, with a Protestant wife, and he had a good marriage, but except for religion.</span> <span id="s2337">He insisted on going to Catholic church, and she insisted going with the children -- well, he was a very nice guy.</span> <span id="s2338">So here I was in Heidelberg, and he was happy that I was not a homosexual, you know, I was very much interested in girls, and I started dating like mad.</span> <span id="s2339">I met my wife after three months there.</span> <span id="s2340">In those three months, before I met my wife, I had gone out with three different girls, and had a good time, and one of them was a -- woman was in the PX -- I don’t know you know what the PX is, sales girl.</span> <span id="s2341">And when I got married she was a saleslady who advised my wife what -- what she’ll buy.</span> <span id="s2342">Well, she knows I’m going to get married, but -- and she was just a girl, German girl that just want to get married to an American.</span> <span id="s2343">And wat -- when I met my wife was in the headquarters in the office, a very interesting, I’m not going to tell the whole story, but I knew immediately, and I -- like I said I was in meantime going from 19 to 31 years, 12 years a long time, and I had -- in the meantime, I had a couple of girls I might have considered, including my fiancée.</span> <span id="s2344">But when I met my wife, after three months I ask her to marry.</span> <span id="s2345">I was three months in Heidelberg, and another three months that I met her.</span></p> <p><span id="s2346">Q: Did you do the list for your wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s2347">A: Yup.</span></p> <p><span id="s2348">Q: Must have turned out pretty well.</span></p> <p><span id="s2349">A: Probably a hundred.</span> <span id="s2350">No, no we -- but I was particularly interested in her opinion about the Nazis, and she was working in these headquarters, in another floor, in a big building, and I watch her once in awhile.</span> <span id="s2351">And a lot of girls were dating American soldiers, and I looked, and she didn’t date, or talk to any American soldiers.</span> <span id="s2352">She wasn’t one of those that just want to get married to an American, and to have a boyfriend.</span> <span id="s2353">And so I said hello to her a couple of times, and she didn’t seem to be interested very much.</span> <span id="s2354">And I was, in meeting her, because she wasn’t dating anybody, I know that -- well, she could have dated a German outside that I didn’t know about, but you -- and so when she was working -- only when she wasn’t studying, but she didn’t have any money to continue her study in Heidelberg.</span> <span id="s2355">She wanted -- she majored in foreign languages, and she knew Italian, and some Russian, and English very well, of course, and she had a job that she had to know English for, and so she interrupt her studies every time she didn’t have any money, she s -- worked up there.</span> <span id="s2356">And I could visit her in her office, but she couldn’t visit me in my office, because that was cofe -- classified secret, the door, you couldn't get in, somebody had to open up on the other side.</span> <span id="s2357">So to meet her -- she didn’t seem to be much interested meeting me.</span> <span id="s2358">I figure I’ll meet her.</span> <span id="s2359">I ask her one time -- oh yeah, the first thing that happened, I -- there was a trial in Heidelberg over the SS -- who -- who was born in Heidelberg, they caught him after the war, he was a -- not -- not high-ranking, a simple guy, who had -- who was accused of having killed three people.</span> <span id="s2360">They didn’t -- didn’t say Jews or not Jews, but he was an SS, but they weren’t sure they could prove it, and the only one and the -- that they caught in Heidelberg, who was a native of Heidelberg.</span> <span id="s2361">But when I read the story in the paper, I read that what he did before he became an SS.</span> <span id="s2362">He was street sweeper in Heidelberg, a guy, very simple, no education -- very little educa -- and a guy with probably inferiority complex, who all of a sudden became an SS, with a nice uniform, looked sharp, but was dumb, not educated.</span> <span id="s2363">And was somebody all of a sudden, and then beat up Jews, or whatever.</span> <span id="s2364">He was a member of the elite in Germany.</span> <span id="s2365">And I looked at it and said, “They ought to cor --,” I said to myself, “they ought to catch the big guys, not a small guy like him.”</span> <span id="s2366">Some of the mass murderers, and n-not [indecipherable] people.</span> <span id="s2367">And I decided I wanted to see a trial.</span> <span id="s2368">I didn’t know the guy, he was not in the camp I was in, and -- but I was just curious how the German courts were doing with a guy like that.</span> <span id="s2369">So I told my boss I wanted to go that day -- I want a day off, I want to go to court, I need you okay that.</span> <span id="s2370">And I went out the door.</span> <span id="s2371">My wife started going out the door, too from a different [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2372">I said, “Where are you going, Miss Suberchess?”</span> <span id="s2373">And she has a Latin name [indecipherable] in Germany during the Middle Ages, only the doctors, teachers, and the pe-people who could read and write, they spoke Latin, not German, educated people.</span> <span id="s2374">And her family was a gen -- m-mainly a family of teachers.</span> <span id="s2375">So I said, “Where are you going?”</span> <span id="s2376">She said she’s going to court.</span> <span id="s2377">“Oh,” I said, “I’m going to court, too.”</span> <span id="s2378">I said, “What -- what kind of a crime did you commit?”</span> <span id="s2379">I was trying to make a joke.</span> <span id="s2380">[indecipherable] “I didn’t commit a crime, but I’m just watch a trial.”</span> <span id="s2381">I said, “I’m watching a trial, too.</span> <span id="s2382">What kind of a trial, are you a witness, then?”</span> <span id="s2383">No, she didn’t want to tell me right away.</span> <span id="s2384">And it came out she’s going the same place I was.</span> <span id="s2385">And I couldn’t think of a reason why a German girl would be interested in SS, unless she was a relative, or something.</span> <span id="s2386">So I ask her, “Why are you interested in SS?”</span> <span id="s2387">And she gave me the -- a reason, the same reason that I was interested in it.</span> <span id="s2388">See how justice is done in Germany today.</span> <span id="s2389">So that got me interested in her, more than just for other reasons, and a young woman is interested in -- in Nazis, and [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2390">And I said, “Okay, you want a ride?”</span> <span id="s2391">She was going by bicycle, I had my car, and is that okay?</span> <span id="s2392">She accepted a ride, and the -- excuse me [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2393">So we got to the court, I parked my car, I -- like I said, I was in uniform, and came out with her, and there’s a -- a guard or some guy up there by the doors on the courtroom, and the courtroom is filled already with people, complete -- the guy said, “Can’t go in, it’s full.”</span> <span id="s2394">Well, I figured I am an officer in the United States army, they lost the war, I’m going to go in, no matter what.</span> <span id="s2395">And I -- and I spoke German.</span> <span id="s2396">So I said to the guard, “Who gave you your order that you can’t let an American army officer in?”</span> <span id="s2397">“Oh,” he said, “they didn’t tell me an American army officer, they said nobody goes in.”</span> <span id="s2398">“Well, I -- I am sorry, but you will make a place for me.</span> <span id="s2399">I’ll --,” and there was my future wife, left out.</span> <span id="s2400">I couldn’t speak for her, that -- give her a seat, but I, as an army officer had -- was considered maybe -- they -- they -- they figured we had -- we won the war, and we wer -- demanded certain things, but I wasn’t normally doing that, but I was insisting here, in this case.</span> <span id="s2401">Make a long story short, my wife didn’t go into the court, and this guy told a German civilian to leave, that he had to make some space for some important people.</span> <span id="s2402">But only me, and I sat up there, and I listened to an unimpressive to -- trial.</span> <span id="s2403">The guy -- I almost felt sorry for the guy -- the former -- he was a beat up old -- well, not old man, but he was, at that time I’m going to see him an old man, because I was only 30 and something, and he was 45 or something.</span> <span id="s2404">Well, they couldn’t prove actually, any murder, but he admitted having been SS, having been in certain place, and had beaten up people, and to -- but not -- they couldn’t prove that he murdered people.</span> <span id="s2405">So he got a couple of months in jail.</span> <span id="s2406">That was standard throughout Germany [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2407">But I -- it bothered me.</span> <span id="s2408">I said, “Here is a guy who probably had an inferiority complex.</span> <span id="s2409">In the concentration camp he could beat up professors and doctors, and people who were more intelligent, and more educated than he was, because he had no education.</span> <span id="s2410">And he got caught.</span> <span id="s2411">But the big biggies, they were free.</span> <span id="s2412">And I sa -- I thought that the guys who were over him should be sitting in -- in the docket there then.</span> <span id="s2413">Well, I can’t say I’m s -- I felt sorry for him, but I -- I -- I have -- didn’t think that was -- he shouldn’t be sitting there, that somebody else should be.</span> <span id="s2414">Okay, that’s Heidelberg.</span> <span id="s2415">So then we come to a long story, and I do want to say -- to be [indecipherable] how I finally got to marry my wife, what problems there were involved, on the part of the Americans, on the part of the Germans, on the part of her family, on the part religion, politics, east, west, combination --</span></p> <p><span id="s2416">Q: You did -- just to remind you, you did talk earlier on in the interview, just as a digression yesterday about the problems with the army, about how you weren’t supposed to marry a foreign -- a foreigner, particularly a German, because of your -- your work with secret materials.</span> <span id="s2417">So that part’s been covered.</span></p> <p><span id="s2418">A: Th-That is ma --</span></p> <p><span id="s2419">Q: But the rest, it would be good to hear.</span></p> <p><span id="s2420">A: But i-it’s a long story, with a rabbi involved, and a general involved, and a -- the Germans, because of Communism, and because of Nazism too.</span> <span id="s2421">And also, not myself, I -- I wanted to make sure one thing, I’m not marrying to a big Nazi family, in respect to my parents, not that she would have had any guilt in this, her father, if he would have been a Nazi, but that would be a very odd thing.</span> <span id="s2422">But I did have a secretary, or a -- he was actually called in the army, a clerk, for -- he was a soldier, who could type up my classified stuff.</span> <span id="s2423">He was a Jewish guy, by the name of Ross Engle.</span> <span id="s2424">He was -- had a master’s degree in political science, he was drafted.</span> <span id="s2425">Didn’t have any desire to become an officer.</span> <span id="s2426">He would have made a good officer, but -- little guy like me, and he was going out with a German girl that I also knew, and I just talked to [indecipherable] in the finance office, like a cashier, or something like that, military finance office.</span> <span id="s2427">And his case is interesting, it was just the opposite from mine.</span> <span id="s2428">He met this very nice, young girl, very lovely, and it turns out that she came from big Nazi family.</span> <span id="s2429">So big that it was a famous name in Germany.</span> <span id="s2430">He was her -- the brother of her mother, of the Rice Youth Leader, with all the German Jews went into uniform, the Nazi party member.</span> <span id="s2431">And -- like the boy scouts, but they wore little knives, and all that.</span> <span id="s2432">I would have been one, I would have been Jewish, but -- the Hitler Youth.</span> <span id="s2433">That’s what it -- what -- Hitler Youth Leader.</span> <span id="s2434">He was the Hitler Youth Leader of Germany.</span> <span id="s2435">There were two during Hitler’s reign, and he was one of them.</span> <span id="s2436">So the mother was the sister of this guy.</span> <span id="s2437">Well, that was during the war, and I figure well, after the war -- he figured the -- that the war is finished, that they don’t keep their mouth shut, because they were Nazis, and anti-Semites, probably.</span> <span id="s2438">Well, you didn’t have to be a Nazi to be an anti-Semite, necessarily.</span> <span id="s2439">You could have been Nazi, and have known some Jews that you liked, and still be a big Nazi, and -- and still like Jews secretly, or something.</span> <span id="s2440">But in his case it turned out, the poor guy, he was very smart -- like I said, he had a master’s degree in political science.</span> <span id="s2441">He was only a company clerk, he was doing good work, and he -- he met this girl, and so it turned out her family’s Nazi, and when he talked to me about this, he told me then that his father is a rabbi, and his grandfather was a rabbi, and here he was in -- marrying into a Nazi family.</span> <span id="s2442">H-He was in love with the girl.</span> <span id="s2443">Well, I said, “Well, I consider myself lucky, I also -- y- you know about my going out with Miss Dambotsios, and I found out from my wife only recently that he tried to date her too, one time, but she didn’t want to go out with him.</span> <span id="s2444">And so, he came to my wedding, and he took all the pictures.</span> <span id="s2445">I have pictures of -- very nice guy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2446">Q: Do you want to go ahead and say something about your -- your wife, and -- and how that worked?</span></p> <p><span id="s2447">A: So I was very much impressed with her ideas about Nazism, and how much she knew about Jews.</span> <span id="s2448">Not from her parents, but after the war, because they didn’t have any Jews where she lived, in the countryside there.</span> <span id="s2449">All she did, she thinks one girl that she befriended was Jewish, probably, but she wasn’t sure, when she was a kid.</span> <span id="s2450">And so [indecipherable] I did get married to this girl, and he got permission right away, in the -- in the army, you had to get permission, because -- not just for security, but they didn’t want any bad elements to come into United States, girls who were prostitutes, or -- excuse me, or had other things, Communists, or something.</span> <span id="s2451">And so they tried to get the -- the army required two things .</span> <span id="s2452">In one, a form, a letter from your commanding officer, your boss, that he certif -- that he okays that so and so gets married to -- and there’s -- he had to do some checking with the police, and then finally approve it.</span> <span id="s2453">In a case of an officer, in my case, I had to meet Colonel Skolie, my immediate superior, but it was only a performer thing.</span> <span id="s2454">I had the paper typed out, and I just said, “Would you please sign my permission to get married?”</span> <span id="s2455">Because I was an officer, I had more of a privilege, let’s say.</span> <span id="s2456">And they -- they -- they assumed that an officer, which wasn’t always true, had the common sense not to marry a prostitute, or -- but they did.</span> <span id="s2457">Some of the best looking girls were prostitutes there.</span> <span id="s2458">And they were [indecipherable] glad to get rid of them, send them to United States.</span> <span id="s2459">And there were guys who knew their wives were prostitute, and -- and still want to marry them.</span> <span id="s2460">But anyway, when I came with my paper to my colonel, he of course signed it right away, and he had known me for awhile already, so we had no problem.</span> <span id="s2461">But then my -- the second thing that we had to get was permission from the chaplain -- not permission, to have the chaplain signature on there.</span> <span id="s2462">If you’re Jewish, you go to the Jewish chaplain.</span> <span id="s2463">That’s the -- in the army they have chaplains who are catering -- catering wha -- providing the military with moral support, or religious support, who on Sundays have a mass, if they’re Catholic, or they’re Protestant, and on Friday night have a Jewish service in that army chapel, which is -- in the army serves all faith.</span> <span id="s2464">So when the Jews have their service, they cover up the cross, usually, and the rabbi comes and talks from the chapel.</span> <span id="s2465">In that time the Jewish community in Heidelberg was about 200 people.</span> <span id="s2466">So we had a Jewish chaplain, in this case, Orthodox.</span> <span id="s2467">So there is -- you never know what the chaplain, if he’s Jewish, whether Orthodox, Reformed, or Conservative.</span> <span id="s2468">The army took them in, and there were usually many Orthodox rabbis who didn’t have a job because every o-orth -- there a lot of ri -- guys -- rabbis, who don’t have a congregation here in the United States.</span> <span id="s2469">And the army needed rabbis, and they went to [indecipherable] called the chaplain’s board, or the chaplain -- they advised the army on who might make a good military chaplain.</span> <span id="s2470">And they only re-recommended Orthodox people, which was wrong, because the majority of Jews are not Orthodox in the United States of -- United States Army.</span> <span id="s2471">In Israel it’s a different -- even there they’re not -- they’re not the majority.</span> <span id="s2472">But the Orthodox chaplains are required not to s-say the prayers all in Hebrew, but to talk mainly English, and have the He-Hebrew.</span> <span id="s2473">Whereas the -- the Reform rabbis have everything English, and I preferred that because w -- if I wanted to say a prayer or anything, I like to understand what I’m -- I could read Hebrew, but I didn’t understand.</span> <span id="s2474">I studied for Bar Mitzvah, and never was.</span> <span id="s2475">Two weeks before my Bar Mitzvah, the war started, in 1940, and I was not Bar Mitzvahed, so -- but I knew how to read Hebrew, and I knew the prayers, but I didn’t understand it.</span> <span id="s2476">I was never much interested in it, but -- but when I did go to chapel, I wanted to make sure if I did say something, I want to understand it.</span> <span id="s2477">So, with the Orthodox, we had no common ground, they -- they didn’t do what the army [indecipherable] told them to, to say it in English, but they -- they rattled, and they shugon, and they went through the motions like the Orthodox do, and I didn’t do this at ho -- in my hometown in Germany, and I didn’t do this here, but [indecipherable] just went along, everybody chanted certain songs.</span> <span id="s2478">So, the one we had in Hamburg that time was Orthodox, and I knew was going to face, going with my paper to have him sign it, he probably would say how about your wife converting before I sign the paper.</span> <span id="s2479">And exactly what happened.</span> <span id="s2480">But, before I went to the Jewish chaplain, I went to the cath -- no, to the Protestant chaplain.</span> <span id="s2481">There were three chaplains there, Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish.</span> <span id="s2482">And the Protestant chaplain was the head chaplain, he had the highest rank.</span> <span id="s2483">He was a colonel, and the Jewish chaplain was a major.</span> <span id="s2484">And like I said, I was a lieutenant, so I was even lower.</span> <span id="s2485">They all had ranks.</span> <span id="s2486">I went to the chief chaplain, becau -- you see, it just said chaplain’s signature, but what they meant was of your faith.</span> <span id="s2487">There wasn’t -- we didn’t have to do this, but I figure I’m going to get around this Orthodox chaplain, who is go -- not going to sign my paper, because he wants my wife to d -- to convert.</span> <span id="s2488">And I went to the Protestant chaplain, and he said, “Well,” he said, “yes, I could sign your paper, but I have to respect the Jewish chaplain, he is [indecipherable] your faith here, and I would feel better if you get his signature.”</span> <span id="s2489">And I said to the chaplain, “I tell you the truth, I didn’t go to the Jewish chaplain because the Orthodox.</span> <span id="s2490">That’s okay with me, but I am afraid he is going to ask me for my wife to convert before he sign the paper.</span> <span id="s2491">And I’m not willing to let that happen, because although my wife probably would convert to marry me, but to me it doesn’t mean a thing, and I don’t approve of the Orthodox, I don’t go around -- if we had a Reform rabbi, I would consider it, but we don’t happen to have one.”</span> <span id="s2492">And he said, “Try it anyway.”</span> <span id="s2493">Okay, I went to see the Jewish chaplain.</span> <span id="s2494">I knew him already.</span> <span id="s2495">And he was a guy who was not -- not very nice.</span> <span id="s2496">He was very Yiddish, if you say, and from he -- like he ca -- he came out of the ghetto, and he was telling me what to do, and that my wife or I should do this or that.</span> <span id="s2497">And I said, “I am not Orthodox, rabbi, please.</span> <span id="s2498">I respect your views, I want you respect mine, too.</span> <span id="s2499">And I, if I consider myself anything, I am Jewish, and I’m not religious.</span> <span id="s2500">And, as a matter of fact, I have questions not about Judaism, but religion in general, and my faith, because of the concen,” -- he knew I was in concentration camp.</span> <span id="s2501">“And I’m not sure about God, but in the respect m-my parents would have been alive, and they would have wanted me to marry in the chapel, Jewish.</span> <span id="s2502">And they probably would have approved of a non-Jewish wife, but I -- I -- I would get married in this chapel, but not Orthodox.”</span> <span id="s2503">And I knew that the chapels in the army, even if they were Orthodox, if he did approve of a marriage, or a wedding [indecipherable] to perform a wedding, he could perform this in a way that was not approved by the army, was not completely Orthodox, but -- End of Tape Six, Side A Beginning Tape Six, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s2504">A: “How about converting your wife before I sign this paper?”</span> <span id="s2505">I said, “I may -- no thank you, we’ve have talked about extensively.</span> <span id="s2506">I just want your signature, so I can go ahead and get married.”</span> <span id="s2507">He hesitated, he said he wanted to talk about conversion to my wife, and -- who was not with me.</span> <span id="s2508">And I said, “No, ki -- rabbi, this is between me and my wife, not between you and my wife.</span> <span id="s2509">And we talked about it plenty, and me -- don’t think -- I think my wife is a good -- will be a good wife, and had a good background, and I couldn’t require more than that.</span> <span id="s2510">So please sign my paper.”</span> <span id="s2511">And he said he wants to talk to her, he wants a conversion.</span> <span id="s2512">I said, “No, I told you, we’re not -- she’s not going to convert.</span> <span id="s2513">Not because she doesn’t -- I don’t want to.”</span> <span id="s2514">And he was really upset because a Jew was doing this.</span> <span id="s2515">But that’s mine life, not his life, or anybody else’s.</span> <span id="s2516">So I said, “Okay, you’re not going to sign?</span> <span id="s2517">I’m going back and I’ll see what we can do about this.”</span> <span id="s2518">He said, “You -- I won’t sign til I talk some more to you.”</span> <span id="s2519">He didn’t sign, he didn’t say til she converts, be -- he could not do that.</span> <span id="s2520">And I said, “Before I leave your office, rabbi, I’m going to tell you, you are a bad rabbi.</span> <span id="s2521">You are a bad military officer.</span> <span id="s2522">Here I was, a lower ranking guy, and I’m telling you something that somebody should have heard a long time to you.</span> <span id="s2523">Not because you don’t want to -- me to -- you know, give paper to marry, or my wife to convert, because in general, you run lousy services here in this chapel, and this is not just me who’s saying this.</span> <span id="s2524">You are an Orthodox rabbi, and I’m not Orthodox, that’s not why I’m against you.</span> <span id="s2525">Because the army requires you, as an Orthodox rabbi, to conduct most of your service in English, and that’s why you lost the congregation here, and there are about 200 Jews here, and you walk in here on a Friday night, you get a dozen people here, you don’t get anybody.</span> <span id="s2526">And we had rabbis who were Orthodox, who had a lot more attraction to get Jews in here.</span> <span id="s2527">Apparently you don’t care.</span> <span id="s2528">Y-You care about certain things about Judaism.”</span> <span id="s2529">And I -- finally, I shouted at him, and that was it, I walked out.</span> <span id="s2530">And I was told I can get permission to get married without getting his signature on there.</span> <span id="s2531">Okay.</span> <span id="s2532">Two, three weeks later, I heard about a plane going to Israel for American military officers who were chaplains, or rabbis, for the clergy, military clergy.</span> <span id="s2533">And it was a private trip, a German airplane, passenger plane, but somebody in the headquarters was arranging this, to visit the holy land, which is for Jews, Catholics, it’s for everybody, Christian and Jew.</span> <span id="s2534">So it was a very cheap price, 200 dollars, I believe, for two weeks in Israel, including the trip.</span> <span id="s2535">This was in 1956 -- ’57.</span> <span id="s2536">And I heard there were two seats empty on there, they couldn’t fill two seats.</span> <span id="s2537">But like I said, all the people going were -- were clergymen, and I found out that my rabbi wasn’t going, which was fine with me, but two seats were free, but you had to pay for it, just like the rabbis did.</span> <span id="s2538">For the rabbis it was not paid for by the army, but it’s just some time off they got that -- seeing the holy land.</span> <span id="s2539">I had an uncle in Israel, who I’m -- talked about before on the tape, who went to Israel, became prisoner of war, fought for the briti -- with the British, and -- my mother’s brother, and who broke the saber for the police, that’s the story I have here on the tape.</span> <span id="s2540">And I wanted to see him, and he was getting to be an old man, he -- he was a widow in the meantime, no children, and he was my favorite uncle, actually.</span> <span id="s2541">And he also had done something in the war, fought against the Germans in the first World War, he was in [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2542">Okay, so I went and I said, “If these seats not -- can I pay for one of these seats and go to Israel?”</span> <span id="s2543">“Sure.”</span> <span id="s2544">I put my name on the list, off I went to Israel.</span> <span id="s2545">Who sits next to me?</span> <span id="s2546">The only -- the only Reformed rabbi military we had in Germany.</span> <span id="s2547">I had heard of him, but he was far away from where I was at.</span> <span id="s2548">He is my -- he sits next to me, and we look at each other, and he didn’t know who was I, I didn’t know who he was.</span> <span id="s2549">And I mention my name, and he said, “Willner, Willner.</span> <span id="s2550">I got it.</span> <span id="s2551">You are the one that gave hell to the Orthodox rabbi in the headquarters in Heidelberg where there’s chaplain.”</span> <span id="s2552">I said, “How do you know?”</span> <span id="s2553">You know, to -- word had gotten around in the meantime, there was this young officer who we called this chaplain of the doorma, and what happened, there was a -- a retreat for Jewish chaplains, military chaplain, and Jewish military chaplain assistants.</span> <span id="s2554">Every chaplain had an assistant, a Jewish guy in the case of a Jewish chaplain.</span> <span id="s2555">In the case of the Catholic chaplain, he was Catholic soldier.</span> <span id="s2556">And they were the clerks, the secretaries, in fact.</span> <span id="s2557">So our rabbi had the secretary, a Jewish guy, a -- a sergeant or something, who was also main career in the army, and when I had the argument with the chaplain, door was open to the next office, and there was the Jewish chaplain assistant sitting outside.</span> <span id="s2558">And he had gone on this retreat, and he had told the other ch-chaplain assistants that, you know, “Some young lieutenant in Heidelberg, he really came in one day, and he gave my boss, who’s a major, gave him hell, told him off in no uncertain terms, what a bad rabbi he was.</span> <span id="s2559">I -- I -- I never heard anything like it.”</span> <span id="s2560">And so, he had all the other chaplain assistant.</span> <span id="s2561">Then the assistant of the chaplain I was sitting next to on the airplane, he had heard it from the assistant from the Orthodox chaplain, the story.</span> <span id="s2562">He said, “You are the guy I -- Willner, who wanted to get -- want to get married, and,” -- I say, “Well, that’s the whole thing.</span> <span id="s2563">I don’t care about Orthodox, and -- but I just want to have him sign my paper, and if he didn’t want to sign it, and didn’t,” -- I also said I -- I couldn’t use the chapel, but maybe get some other rabbi to come.</span> <span id="s2564">There weren’t many rabbis in Germany, but -- to perform the ceremony.</span> <span id="s2565">And I said, “Well, I don’t get married -- I got married at city hall.</span> <span id="s2566">I’d -- it’s not required that I get married under Jewish law, or [indecipherable] law in the chapel, I just don’t get married in the chapel.”</span> <span id="s2567">And so the Reform rabbi said, “You have a little problem there.</span> <span id="s2568">I -- I don’t really see it as a problem.</span> <span id="s2569">I don’t know your future wife.</span> <span id="s2570">I think differently about these things, and I’m willing to marry you.</span> <span id="s2571">Beca I -- if you want -- you want to get married in the first place in the chapel, why should you be kept out of the chapel because the rabbi doesn’t agree?</span> <span id="s2572">That’s not his private property, the chapel,” he said.</span> <span id="s2573">“He should marry anybody wants to get married.”</span> <span id="s2574">I said, “Yeah, he -- he’ll marry anybody wants to convert.</span> <span id="s2575">Maybe some guy marries a prostitute off the street, as long as she c-converts to Judaism, he’ll -- he’ll marry her, probably,” you know.</span> <span id="s2576">And so this guy -- by this time we were finished with the trip.</span> <span id="s2577">In Israel we separate, I’m going to see my uncle, they went sightseeing.</span> <span id="s2578">In two weeks we met again to depart Israel, and on the way back, I sat next to him again, and he said, “You [indecipherable] Israel, and -- and by the way, do you still want to get married in the chapel?”</span> <span id="s2579">“Yeah,” I said, “yes.</span> <span id="s2580">Because my parents would like to see me get marr -- and it’s a nicer thing than just signing a paper in city hall, and I’ll go for a Jewish ceremony, but nothing -- even Orthodox, you know, but -- but not somebody who require my wife to be a -- become a,” -- he, “Okay, I don’t require your wife to convert, but after I meet her, I make up my own opinion I want to marry you.”</span> <span id="s2581">He wanted to see what kind of woman she was, and -- so -- “But you have to come to my place, get married in my chapel, I cannot do it in that chapel in [indecipherable].”</span> <span id="s2582">I said okay.</span> <span id="s2583">“But first you introduce me to your wife.”</span> <span id="s2584">So we went, and he secluded himself for about two hours in his office while I was waiting outside.</span> <span id="s2585">And I said, “What are you guys doing in there?</span> <span id="s2586">You -- you converting my wife now, when she comes out you say she is a Jew.”</span> <span id="s2587">And he -- he was asking her questions, and telling her.</span> <span id="s2588">And he says, “Your wife, it seems to me she probably knows as much about Jude as you do, if not more.”</span> <span id="s2589">I say, [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2590">“Well, I gave her a couple of books to learn some more about Judaism, see, because I want to -- if I marry her in a Jewish ceremony, I want her to know about Judaism, but no conversion.”</span> <span id="s2591">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2592">And as far as the actual date is concerned, we can make that later.</span> <span id="s2593">I went back to Heidelberg -- and his place was a couple hours away from Heidelberg, and I -- he -- yeah, a-at that time, talking about luck, not his luck, the Orthodox chaplain was ordered back to United States before my wedding day came up, and I was to go to the other chaplain -- because he had a child that was -- mentally had a problem, and for personal reasons he was transferred back to United States, to another job in the army.</span> <span id="s2594">And we had no chaplain in Heidelberg, and so the chaplain called me up, the -- he informed that, “Oh, you are lucky.</span> <span id="s2595">You don’t even have to come my chapel down here, I’ll come to your chapel.</span> <span id="s2596">You -- I’ll perform the marriage in front of the Jews that you know, that live in Heidelberg, and so as we planned to do here, but you do in your chapel.</span> <span id="s2597">I could not have done this if your chaplain was still there, that’s like hitting him in the face, you know, that’s some -- making him look bad.</span> <span id="s2598">But he’s not there, and so we’re not doing -- he’s not coming back either, not [indecipherable] gone for sure.”</span> <span id="s2599">[indecipherable] fine.</span> <span id="s2600">So he said, “Well, you know, we’re not going to have a big thing.”</span> <span id="s2601">I said, “I don’t want a big thing.</span> <span id="s2602">Just a few friends from the office,” or -- non-Jews, Jews, my boss is going come to the wedding, and we go to city hall, say -- in Germany you have a very f -- not fancy, but a more former wedding -- even in the city hall when you get your papers -- not talking about the party, or dinner, or something.</span> <span id="s2603">But so he came to Heidelberg, and we went to the chapel.</span> <span id="s2604">I took my boss along, my bosses boss, high ranking officer.</span> <span id="s2605">Rosinger, the guy who was going to take the picture, and my -- and the only Jewish guy in my -- no, Rosinger was one in the military Jewish guy, and I had one civilian [indecipherable] for me, who was a GS 12, who was an expert on Intelligence some field, who was born as a German Jew in Berlin, whose father had been arrested in the Crystal night, going to Dachau, and the mother was Christian.</span> <span id="s2606">The mother thought the father’s not going to come back from Dachau, she committed suicide in Berlin.</span> <span id="s2607">And -- and the father came back from Dachau, and his wife was dead.</span> <span id="s2608">But that’s just -- this happened.</span> <span id="s2609">So Jerry Coats, who was also Jewish, then came along.</span> <span id="s2610">He married a girl also from a Nazi family, a judge, a Nazi judge who didn’t want any part of him, but he was the other Jewish guy.</span> <span id="s2611">So we had Jerry, and Rosinger, and my boss, and the boss’ boss, and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2612">Q: Johanna’s parents didn’t come?</span></p> <p><span id="s2613">A: They asked to come, and the father was retired already, by ’65, and they said to him when he applied, “Only in case of death.”</span> <span id="s2614">[indecipherable] allowed to go to y-your daughter’s funeral in Heidelberg.</span> <span id="s2615">And he said, “Then I don’t have to see her any more,” when she died, and -- you know, ridiculous, but they -- what they wanted to do, people who were drawing social security in East Germany, which he was, as a teacher, they were hoping they were staying in the west then, then the west will have to pay social security [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2616">But they didn’t -- they couldn’t come.</span> <span id="s2617">They did come one time, but not for our wedding.</span></p> <p><span id="s2618">Q: So you hadn’t met them by the time you got married, or had you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2619">A: After I got married.</span> <span id="s2620">They stayed a couple of days, and then went back.</span> <span id="s2621">So we went to chapel, the day came [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2622">He performed a Jewish ceremony, breaking the glass.</span> <span id="s2623">It was pretty much -- just wasn’t very Orthodox, he did other thing.</span> <span id="s2624">He gave us a Hebrew certificate, Hebrew and English, signed officially by him, so that we had a Jewish marriage, and our piece -- people there at the altar with me.</span> <span id="s2625">And he made a little speech, and then he said, “We’re going to go for a snack downstairs.”</span> <span id="s2626">They had a social hall downstairs, that they had in all the chapel of the churches here, and you meet for the ornek Shabbat on Friday night.</span> <span id="s2627">And said okay.</span> <span id="s2628">I actually planned to take them to lunch every -- the -- all these people.</span> <span id="s2629">And we go downstairs, and very quietly -- this is a big building, right across from the headquarters.</span> <span id="s2630">Very quietly, a lot of the Jews that knew me, or didn’t know me, they had passed the word around, have had the wedding very quiet, I should have a surprise.</span> <span id="s2631">We come downstairs to the social hall, there are about 150 - 200 people there, not just Jewish, for our marriage, and the food, and everyth -- they had done this -- our wedding was upstairs in the chapel -- very quietly through the back door.</span> <span id="s2632">And somebody stood in the street, and they said, “Be quiet, don’t talk, this way,” and so.</span> <span id="s2633">Not only did we had the rabbi, and these other people there, I had a second rabbi there.</span> <span id="s2634">And the rabbi whose wife was a woman who knew my family, was born in the same town that I was born in Germany, who knew my family, he’s still alive today.</span> <span id="s2635">He died since.</span> <span id="s2636">He was con-Conservative, but he had just been assigned to Germany, and he’s been assigned to fill a chaplain job, but he didn’t want to intrude on my chaplain, and he waited til I came down.</span> <span id="s2637">So we had two rabbis at my wedding, one rabbis wife, woman from my hometown and knew the family.</span> <span id="s2638">I didn’t know her then, but [indecipherable] little boy.</span> <span id="s2639">And so they knew about my family.</span> <span id="s2640">So Rabbi Vidall remain a rabbi for 25 years in the army, and she settled out in California.</span> <span id="s2641">So, I had a nice wedding, and then I invited the same people that were initially in the group, for dinner in a -- a restaurant in Heidelberg.</span> <span id="s2642">So, I was lucky.</span> <span id="s2643">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2644">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2645">Ah, hold on one second.</span></p> <p><span id="s2646">A: After I got married, everything was finished -- finished ralb.</span> <span id="s2647">I didn’t know this, but they had considered me, before I got married, to be assigned as a liaison officer to the German CIA, as a army liaison officer, US Army, because I spoke German fluently, and they require that.</span> <span id="s2648">In the meantime I got married, and they said -- the Germans said, “If he’s married, the officer, his wife must be an American, but to also speak German fluently.”</span> <span id="s2649">Well, I -- I just happened to fit the bill, and the -- in the first one I was not married, and then I was married, too.</span> <span id="s2650">So when I then got called in and was told I get the job, and my wife was cleared, and our general G2, he’s the chief Intelligence officer of the command for Europe, he called me in and said, “Well now, you are on the way to occupy a very important job.</span> <span id="s2651">We picked you because we feel you fit the bill, but I know your background, concentration camps.</span> <span id="s2652">You do not go there to find out who the Nazis are.</span> <span id="s2653">You find -- you go there because you have a job to do for the United States.</span> <span id="s2654">I can understand if you have any feelings, you find Nazis in there.</span> <span id="s2655">We know that, but your job is not to uncover them, your job is to see that we get all the report that we’re supposed to get, that the people that we interview, and so on, that they’re not -- they don’t keep the information from us.”</span> <span id="s2656">Former Nazis, or whatever.</span> <span id="s2657">“But not for -- because of what happened to you, that you are getting revenge.”</span> <span id="s2658">I said, “You don’t have to worry about it.</span> <span id="s2659">I know what job I have to do.</span> <span id="s2660">But, I will not associate socially with the guys I know who previously had been big Nazis to all of a sudden cater to us, and,” -- “That’s okay,” he said, “but like I said, you’re not going there to stir up trouble in the German agency.”</span> <span id="s2661">They all had ph-phony names, and there were war criminals who were hired after the war, but soon gotten rid of later, but they came in there.</span> <span id="s2662">So I went to the agency, and everything wound up very well, til one day -- they had three liaison officers like myself, British, French, and ger -- and -- and American, with the German agency, and everything went on fine, and -- til one day the French liaison officer asked for a meeting with me outside the agency where we were working, to have lunch someplace in the countryside.</span> <span id="s2663">And he wants to talk to me about something very seriously, that he felt that I understand more than anybody else, about Nazis and the German CIA, specifically one man, who was an SS officer, and Gestapo member, and you know, had committed a war crime in Czechoslovakia, who was working with us, but who is working really against us, because he is one who will not give us all the reports, who looks down on us, who probably still a Nazi, and who -- who really doesn’t cooperate with us.</span> <span id="s2664">“If he had cooperated, I probably wouldn’t have said a thing,” he said, “but here’s his file,” and he gave me a file about two inches thick, in a briefcase, and he say, “Take it back with you, look it over yourself, and we, the French government, want this guy out of this job.</span> <span id="s2665">And since he’s in the American occupation zone,” wh-where we were located, “I feel I should go to the American liaison officer, and have him take care of it.”</span> <span id="s2666">And I just -- with a smile he said, “I know, because of your background, you’ll do something about it.”</span> <span id="s2667">I said, “Well, frankly, you’re right, but my general told me that I’m not here to find out who the Nazis are, who the war criminals are.</span> <span id="s2668">You know what my job is, same as yours.</span> <span id="s2669">But I know we,” -- somebody like this, who was sentenced to death twice, in absentia, in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s2670">After the war, they couldn’t find him.</span> <span id="s2671">They knew him as a worker -- they knew he was alive somewhere, because he had submerged in a German agency under a different name.</span> <span id="s2672">So the French officer, “Here’s the file, Eddie, take it home with you.</span> <span id="s2673">If your general decides to do nothing about it, we will do something about it.</span> <span id="s2674">But I’ll leave it to your judgment.”</span> <span id="s2675">So he said -- I said, “What will you do if my people say no, they don’t want any part of that?</span> <span id="s2676">Like I said, the general told me, I’m not there to find out the SS or the Gestapo man.”</span> <span id="s2677">He said, “Very simple,” he said, “and please convey this to your general.</span> <span id="s2678">We will give it to the local newspapers, we will make public that in a new -- in the west German government, in the newly created Central Intelligence Agency of West Germany, you have a guy who was condemned to death by the Czechs, and you employ him.</span> <span id="s2679">Not very good for the German -- the new west German government.”</span> <span id="s2680">I said, “Good.”</span> <span id="s2681">I said, “I’ll take care of it.</span> <span id="s2682">I don’t think you’ll have to go newspapers, but I don’t know, but I cannot promise.”</span> <span id="s2683">I took it to Heidelberg.</span> <span id="s2684">Right away I ask for -- I get into the general’s office, sometimes very difficult.</span> <span id="s2685">I said, “I have something of utmost importance.”</span> <span id="s2686">Okay, I was let in.</span> <span id="s2687">I said, “General, I remember what you told me, my job is not to find out who the Nazis are, but I found something worse, I found a war criminal in our midst, who is also probably against us, Americans, and I did not go after him.</span> <span id="s2688">Here’s what happened, the French asked me to speak to them, and gave me a file for you to look over, and make a decision.</span> <span id="s2689">We hoping to get him out.”</span> <span id="s2690">And that actually took place.</span> <span id="s2691">He said, “Okay.”</span> <span id="s2692">He had no problem with that, that I was just passing it on.</span> <span id="s2693">I said, “Frankly, I -- I -- I read the whole file, and the man, on a high level, he was retired early -- they said retired, but I think he was transferred to another place, under another name.”</span> <span id="s2694">But that’s all I could do, but I did something where I could do.</span> <span id="s2695">The director general of the agency where I was, one time told a young officer, a naval officer West Germany [indecipherable] was working temporarily.</span> <span id="s2696">He didn’t know I was in a concentration camp when I got to his agency, but one day I was -- it was very hot in the office, I took my jacket off, I had a short sleeve shirt on, and somebody saw the number on my arm.</span> <span id="s2697">Apparently he knew right away what that was, and the word got around to the director that -- that the American liaison officer probably was in concentration camp.</span> <span id="s2698">And he never talked to me about it, the boss there, but the naval officer, a young guy, who was not [indecipherable] young guy, after the war, he became a naval officer, the guy was about 30 years old, married.</span> <span id="s2699">He in -- I invited him -- he invited me to his home first for dinner one time with my wife, and I invite him to my house.</span> <span id="s2700">And we didn’t talk about business, because I figured that was improper, that they probably think I’m going to li -- hear him out, see what he knows about them, and digging up things that they didn’t want us to know.</span> <span id="s2701">And after the social visit, the two social visits, he came to my office.</span> <span id="s2702">He said he’d been told by the director not to soci -- socially associate with me.</span> <span id="s2703">They were afraid I was going to find out there were a lot -- a lot of the guys in there who -- so that’s the story about that I was --</span></p> <p><span id="s2704">Q: Well, we’re about at the end of the side here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2705">End of Tape Six, Side B Beginning of Tape Seven, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s2706">Q: Okay, one second.</span> <span id="s2707">This is tape number seven, side A, of an interview with Eddie Willner, and -- and what we’re going to do, since we’re pressed for time, is we’re going to skip ahead, and -- and talk about some really contemporary issues on -- Mr. Willner is going in -- to say something before we introduce this -- this videotape.</span></p> <p><span id="s2708">A: On the introduction, it’s very short, I served for 21 years, selected by the city council as a member of the public safety and human relations advisory commission.</span> <span id="s2709">A normal assignment is three years, or two years, we had extended, and I’ve been re-selected by -- by the city government, which of -- whi -- there are seven councilors, and -- plus the mayor.</span> <span id="s2710">And at city council meetings, people get sworn in for various long term job.</span> <span id="s2711">And I had volunteered for 21 years, to be a member, and also a chairman of the public safety commission, which we -- we used to be called the law enforcement commission, which has overview the police, the fire department, and the ambulances, yeah.</span> <span id="s2712">But my interest was the police, because I served as criminal investigator, and I felt I had something to offer, maybe advice, and also because the name was added to public safety commission, prob -- human relations commission, which I’m very much interested in.</span> <span id="s2713">And which -- and there were cases to cover, and discuss in the -- first in our commission meeting, then brought up to the city council, and so withot -- and I resigned, like I said, because of my physical disabilities, and I felt I had served enough.</span> <span id="s2714">And of course this volunteering, and without pay, and took up a lot of my time, and I was physically [indecipherable], I thought I -- and all felt I should resign, and I had served long enough, longer than anybody ever served before [indecipherable] on any commission.</span> <span id="s2715">And I was the first one with the police who were -- also [indecipherable], who was named with a badge by the police as a honorary chief of police of Falls Church, and which was very nice, and the city of Falls Church [indecipherable] 50 years, then we became independent from the county.</span> <span id="s2716">So this was first time they assigned anybody, and gave him a badge of po -- poli -- police chief.</span></p> <p><span id="s2717">Q: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s2718">A: And without further ado -- and -- and what I like to mention is that when my son, my youngest son was still living at home, was studying at Georgetown, and become a foreign affairs officer in the State Department eventually, that he thought he also should do something for the city.</span> <span id="s2719">He still lives at home, and the other children are married, of course, but he’s volunteered then, that after I resign, or asked not to be reconsidered for this job, he came to me [indecipherable] and said, “Why don’t I go in your place, and also do something for the city?”</span> <span id="s2720">I said, “It’s fine with me, if you have time to do this, you have to study a lot, but they have meetings at night, but maybe you can handle that.”</span> <span id="s2721">He applied, and there were four or five people applying for two jobs, two of them, there were seven -- there seven commissioners, and two p-place for [indecipherable] and another.</span> <span id="s2722">So he got selected [indecipherable] by it’s usually three -- three city councilors, who review, your -- why -- your -- your knowledge, to a we -- whether or not you could add anything to this.</span> <span id="s2723">And I -- I didn’t think he had too much to offer, but he’s young, and he can ler -- he heard a lot from me what goes on in the city, and the problems, so he is somewhat familiar.</span> <span id="s2724">And he did get selected, and then the day came when he was going to be sworn in, in the front of the city council, and the cit -- in the city hall, publicly, and [indecipherable] people were there.</span> <span id="s2725">Well, it was a regular city council meeting, not -- not for him to be just s-sworn in, was part of it, [indecipherable] many things going on, and the part that deals with his swearing in is on tape, and the mayor made an announcement, and since we were there to watch him, the mayor recognized us, and asked us if we want to stand with him while he’s being sworn in.</span> <span id="s2726">And we went up the podium, and we thought that was it, the oath of office, and then the mayor started talking about the Willner family, and first of all it was the father, it was son is really taking his place, and then the mother [indecipherable] family, and this was completely unexpected by me or my wife, or my son.</span> <span id="s2727">We thought we just going there to watch him being sworn in, in a public meeting.</span> <span id="s2728">And -- and what you see here, you can also hear, you don’t have to see the picture.</span> <span id="s2729">This a time they walk up to the podium, and he is sworn in, and the rest of them you will hear.</span></p> <p><span id="s2730">Q: Okay, I’m going to --</span></p> <p><span id="s2731">[Tape plays] -- before, which is the ad-administration of the oath of office.</span> <span id="s2732">We -- I think we have our people here, and once again the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2733">Q: Okay, this is the mayor speaking.</span></p> <p><span id="s2734">-- people from the neighborhood, thank you very much, and we’ll be working on this item.</span> <span id="s2735">Appreciate that you brought it to our attention.</span> <span id="s2736">Now, we’ll first call for an administration of the oath of office to Jackie Druzinsky.</span></p> <p><span id="s2737">Q: Is this the right part of the tape?</span></p> <p><span id="s2738">A: [indecipherable] the first person [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2739">Q: He’s talking about calling [indecipherable] -- I, Jacqueline Druzinsky do solemnly sw -- -- but all the Willner family that’s here, please, if you could come forward.</span> <span id="s2740">You know, I wonder if the clerk and Michael could come over here for the administration of the oath?</span> <span id="s2741">Anyone else who is with Michael want to come forward?</span> <span id="s2742">Anyone?</span> <span id="s2743">Okay.</span> <span id="s2744">Okay, Eddie?</span></p> <p><span id="s2745">I, Michael Willner do solemnly swear that I will support the Constitution of the United States, the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Virginia, and the ordinances of the city of Falls Church, Virginia, and that I will faithfully and impartially discharge and perform all the duties incumbent upon me as a member of the public safety, and human relations advisory commission for the city of Falls Church, Virginia, according to the best of my abilities, so help me God.</span></p> <p><span id="s2746">Thank you.</span> <span id="s2747">Congratulations.</span> <span id="s2748">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2749">If we could get a picture, why don’t we line everybody up here, and maybe we could -- come up.</span> <span id="s2750">Councilmember Fitzgerald I think is out of town on other business, anyway, this opportunity -- great.</span> <span id="s2751">Thank you.</span> <span id="s2752">Before the Willners leave, here in front of us for a minute, I’d like to make a few remarks.</span> <span id="s2753">The Willner family has contributed literally hundreds of hours, if not thousands of hours to the welfare of this community.</span> <span id="s2754">They represent what our citizens are all about with their voluntary participation in government, and this is a rare circumstance, to have two generations providing leadership to the city on the same board, that is a public safety and human relations advisory commission.</span> <span id="s2755">And it’s an important commission, it’s important work.</span> <span id="s2756">It’s probably, in addition to education, the most important function that our government performs.</span> <span id="s2757">And you’ve helped to perform that in the past, and we look forward to Michael helping us as well.</span> <span id="s2758">Again, congratulations to the whole family, and thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s2759">Q: That’s nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s2760">End of Tape Seven, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s2761">Conclusion of Interview Interview with Eddie Willner</span></p> <p><span id="s2762">October 11, 2000 Beginning Tape One, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s2763">Question: This is United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, volunteer collection, interview with Eddie Willner, conducted by Gail Schwartz, on October 11th, 2000, in Falls Church, Virginia.</span> <span id="s2764">This is a continuation of a post-Holocaust interview conducted by Arwin Donohue on July 12th and 13th, 2000.</span> <span id="s2765">This is tape number one, side A. Before we continue with the interview, I just wanted to clarify some chronology.</span> <span id="s2766">When were you married?</span> <span id="s2767">Do you remember the actual date?</span></p> <p><span id="s2768">Answer: We were married in Germany, in Heidelberg, which is a famous place for getting married, but I was stationed there with the headquarters US Army.</span> <span id="s2769">And we married on the 21st of August, 1958.</span></p> <p><span id="s2770">Q: And you did discuss the c -- the conditions before.</span></p> <p><span id="s2771">A: We got married in the city hall, in the Jewish chapel.</span></p> <p><span id="s2772">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2773">You had talked about that previously.</span> <span id="s2774">The other date I wanted to ask you, is do you know when you became a citizen of the United States, approximately?</span></p> <p><span id="s2775">A: I don’t remember exactly, but I can -- probably 1951, because I went to officer’s school after I became a citizen, I couldn’t go before.</span> <span id="s2776">And that was in ’52.</span> <span id="s2777">I graduated in August ’52.</span> <span id="s2778">So it must have been in ’51 or ’50.</span> <span id="s2779">Of -- maybe ’50.</span></p> <p><span id="s2780">Q: Was this a very significant moment for you, becoming a United States citizen?</span></p> <p><span id="s2781">A: Yes, it was a very significant moment that I wa -- became a citizen not in a big ceremony, I -- I was the only one, and it was an American female judge, and she was trying to be funny.</span> <span id="s2782">I was in uniform, I was a sergeant of the US Army, and she’s asked me three questions before becoming a citizen.</span> <span id="s2783">Lift up your right hand, and answer my questions, that you tell me the truth, and nothing but, and so on.</span> <span id="s2784">So she said, “Who’s Uncle Sam?”</span> <span id="s2785">I said, “I work for him.”</span> <span id="s2786">Okay, that was [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2787">Then she asked me for other questions I’m willing to pay tax in this country.</span> <span id="s2788">Yes.</span> <span id="s2789">And the third question I don’t -- I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s2790">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2791">Let’s now just talk a little bit about your time in army, which again you’ve gone into a lot of detail in the previous interviews, but my question was, when you were stationed in Japan, did you see any evidence, or did you feel any of that -- o-of the Japanese being the United States former enemies?</span> <span id="s2792">Did a-any of that enter into your experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s2793">A: No, because the Japanese way of life -- we were looking as the people, the conqueror, the people who are better maybe, we won the war.</span> <span id="s2794">And they’re very submissive, the Japanese, when they don’t win.</span> <span id="s2795">And they become prisoners, and -- so I -- I didn’t have any problem with that, or -- I don’t know if anybody else had, after MacArthur, who most people feel had the right type of occupation in Japan, for Japan.</span> <span id="s2796">In Germany it wouldn’t have worked that way, had a different type of occupation.</span> <span id="s2797">But in Japan, the Japanese became very pro-American right away, because the policies MacArthur -- and the democracy, which introduced into ja -- Japan right away, and they fell right in line.</span> <span id="s2798">And they changed over very quickly, whereas in Germany, I feel, they didn’t change over so quickly, if they change over at all.</span> <span id="s2799">Compared to the Nazis, I think there is no comparison, except the Japanese themself, compare themself during the war to the Germans.</span> <span id="s2800">They called themself Germans of the Far East.</span> <span id="s2801">But they didn’t do all the things the Germans did.</span> <span id="s2802">So -- and after the war, they also felt that had something in common with the Germans.</span> <span id="s2803">They lost the war, both of them.</span> <span id="s2804">So the big thing that I can state, the difference, when my wife and I took a taxi in Tokyo, and we spoke in English, there was a distance between the taxi driver and us.</span> <span id="s2805">This was in 1950 -- after Korean war, in 1958 - ’59 - ’60.</span> <span id="s2806">And they were still repairing all things from the bombardment.</span> <span id="s2807">And the Japanese taxi drivers, for instance, if we talk German in the back of the cab, he will listen, he will say after awhile, “What nationality are you?”</span> <span id="s2808">And I had this thing, I was an amer -- an American, of course, but they respected the Germans, even though they both -- because like I said, they felt they had something in common, they also lost the war together.</span> <span id="s2809">They felt they were very hard working people, clean, and also ruthless in war.</span> <span id="s2810">So they called themselves, rightfully so , the -- the Asians -- the Germans of the Far East.</span></p> <p><span id="s2811">Q: What did you mean that they didn’t do what the Germans did?</span></p> <p><span id="s2812">A: Well, they did no -- also, we didn’t do what we did to the Germans.</span> <span id="s2813">Prosecute people who committed war crimes.</span> <span id="s2814">They prosecuted some, but not -- they didn’t have concentration camps, although they killed a lot of Chinese, particularly.</span> <span id="s2815">But they didn’t have concentration camps, they had POW camps, where they treat the people just as bad as in -- in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s2816">But on the whole, they did not -- as a matter of fact, they did not have anything against Jews, Japanese.</span> <span id="s2817">They let the Jews come into Shanghai, 5,000 of them re -- and a girl that was in my class in Germany went to -- to Shanghai, and I met her later in Florida, so I know how they were treated.</span> <span id="s2818">But Japan was, for most Jews, a -- a country to wait til the war ended, or a place to go through to some other place.</span> <span id="s2819">But they didn’t bother Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s2820">Q: Did you see any evidence with other Americans, of anti-Japanese sentiment?</span></p> <p><span id="s2821">A: Did the Americans were anti-Japanese, or the Japanese anti-American?</span></p> <p><span id="s2822">Q: N-No, in -- in -- when you were there in the army, with the other American soldiers, did they evidence any anti-Japanese sentiments?</span> <span id="s2823">A: Not very much, no.</span> <span id="s2824">Because the Japanese very friendly, very nice, and I must say my own job, which was in military Intelligence, and we were not in uniform, we were documented civilian.</span> <span id="s2825">I was commanding officer of a small unit.</span> <span id="s2826">They -- they -- we had no problem whatsoever, and when they found out that I had been in a concentration camp, that interests them, but they ca -- always came out with the same thing, “What about the atomic bomb?”</span> <span id="s2827">That we [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2828">To them I was not a German Jew, I was an American civilian, and they felt very bad about us dropping atomic bomb there.</span> <span id="s2829">I didn’t feel so bad about it, and I had problems with them -- with Japanese.</span> <span id="s2830">They took me once to Hiroshima, to the famous museum, just like the Holocaust museum here, and in the museum were life size pictures of what looked like right after the bombing.</span> <span id="s2831">And you saw people there burned.</span> <span id="s2832">People like you c-could see in the Holocaust museums.</span> <span id="s2833">And they took me through this museum for about two hours, and I was the only American, there was three Japanese, they all spoke English.</span> <span id="s2834">And after two hours, it was about lunchtime, one of the Japanese said to me, “Mr. Willner, where we going to eat lunch?”</span> <span id="s2835">“Oh,” I said, “any -- any Japanese restaurant will do, it doesn’t make any difference.”</span> <span id="s2836">And he said to me, “Mr. Willner, you can eat lunch now, after seeing this?”</span> <span id="s2837">And I said, “Yes.</span> <span id="s2838">I’ve seen stuff like this before, not from one bomb, but from many bombs.</span> <span id="s2839">I’ve seen people dead from bombings.</span> <span id="s2840">I’ve seen -- I’ve seen thousands, probably.</span> <span id="s2841">And where I worked in a German synthetic [indecipherable] factory, it was bombed by amer -- by the Americans, but not by one bomb, but by hundred or 200 bombers at one time.</span> <span id="s2842">And s -- and even one city in Germany, city of Draisin, was bombed by the British, and during one bombing raid more people were killed than by one bomb here in Hiroshima.</span> <span id="s2843">Most people don’t know this.”</span> <span id="s2844">So -- well, they got to be a little funny about this, they just [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2845">They wanted me to feel sorry for that.</span> <span id="s2846">And I couldn’t feel sorry for them, because they continued the war, they were warned, and the only thing that stopped our conversation, there was dead silence, was one man’s name was Mr. Maneeshi, and he was the only Japanese I disliked in my six years in Japan, because he was doing certain things that I disapproved of.</span> <span id="s2847">He also lied, which is accepted in Japan, because if you don’t know the answer to something, you make it up.</span> <span id="s2848">But Mr. Maneeshi, I said to him -- after he said about you can eat lunch now after seeing this, I said yes.</span> <span id="s2849">And there was silence, and I said, “By the way, did you ever hear of Pearl Harbor?”</span> <span id="s2850">And then there was dead silence, and then we went to lunch.</span> <span id="s2851">Not one more word was said about the atomic bomb, or Pearl Harbor.</span></p> <p><span id="s2852">Q: So you -- so you spent six years in Japan in the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s2853">A: I spent six years in Japan.</span> <span id="s2854">I went two -- two tours in Japan.</span> <span id="s2855">After the Korean war, when the Korean war was over, I was sent with my unit to Japan, and we stayed nine months.</span> <span id="s2856">So I was as a bachelor the first time.</span> <span id="s2857">The second time I went to Japan, I went voluntarily, the army asked me, I didn’t have to go.</span> <span id="s2858">And if I could take my family, I said yes.</span> <span id="s2859">They said yes.</span> <span id="s2860">And three of my children are born in Japan, three out of the six.</span> <span id="s2861">And one of them has a Japanese name.</span> <span id="s2862">I had very good friends, and we still have Japanese visiting us here.</span> <span id="s2863">I ca -- became a friend of a general, whose daughter learned cooking our house, German cooking, Jewish cooking, American cooking, and her daughter, the Ph.D., not married, still lives now in United States, comes here all the time, and she lives in Pennsylvania, and the mother is about -- that’s the daughter of the general, she is teaching English, she speaks fluent English.</span> <span id="s2864">She had a master’s degree from Columbia University.</span> <span id="s2865">She never lived here, she [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2866">So they a very fine family, and they became in close touch all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2867">Q: Speaking about her being in America, let’s go back a little bit in time.</span> <span id="s2868">What was it like for you?</span> <span id="s2869">How did you feel when you first put your foot down on American soil?</span></p> <p><span id="s2870">A: Well, it was -- everything was new, of course.</span> <span id="s2871">And I didn’t know, really, what to expect.</span> <span id="s2872">Well, maybe I did, but I -- I just didn’t expect anything.</span> <span id="s2873">Because I came here with 10 dollars in my pocket.</span> <span id="s2874">I didn’t have a job, although somebody I met in Europe said, come and see me sometimes.</span> <span id="s2875">But a lot of people said come and see me sometime.</span> <span id="s2876">But he did give me a job.</span> <span id="s2877">And I was told that because I signed what I think are called first papers, at that time [indecipherable] were the papers that you want to become a citizen.</span> <span id="s2878">You apply for it, and you -- your -- your sponsor.</span> <span id="s2879">I was completely separate from him, he -- he was just a guy that lends his name to my -- [indecipherable] that my papers will come over.</span> <span id="s2880">That’s all.</span> <span id="s2881">Once I was here --</span></p> <p><span id="s2882">Q: Y-Y -- Yo -- now you -- I know you had talked about that, what my question was, was when you put that very first time, do you remember putting your foot down on American soil?</span> <span id="s2883">Was that an emotional experience for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2884">A: Not very emotional, but it was something that I had to see, that I was very happy about, even though I didn’t know what to expect.</span> <span id="s2885">A lot of my friends went to Israel, and I had no intention of going, I mentioned it before, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2886">Q: Did you come -- did you come by boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s2887">A: Boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s2888">Q: What boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s2889">A: By boat.</span> <span id="s2890">I don’t remem -- it was -- it was a cattle ship.</span> <span id="s2891">I think it was third or fourth class, down in the hole, and I didn’t pay for it, some Jewish organization paid for it.</span> <span id="s2892">I think it was about a hundred or a hundred and 10 dollars to come over.</span> <span id="s2893">And to my name I had another 10 dollars.</span> <span id="s2894">So I came over.</span> <span id="s2895">And I was told that I would maybe be -- I might be drafted, because the draft didn’t stop right after World War two, so they were still drafting people, and s-sign papers to become an American citizen, there’s -- they had a good chance, that I was healthy, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s2896">Q: Did you see the -- did you see the Statue of Liberty when you came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s2897">A: Did I what?</span></p> <p><span id="s2898">Q: Did you see the Statue of Liberty when you arrived?</span></p> <p><span id="s2899">A: No, unfortunately not.</span> <span id="s2900">There was a -- it was -- everybody was all inside, and we didn’t -- you didn’t see the Statue of Liberty, because there was a lot of fog up there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2901">Q: All right, let’s talk now a little bit about your sharing of your Holocaust experience.</span> <span id="s2902">How much of it did you share with your wife?</span> <span id="s2903">You had talked about some very painful times in your previous interviews, and I was just wondering, did you share these extremely difficult times with your wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s2904">A: I share [indecipherable], yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2905">Q: An-And when did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2906">A: Not immediately, but later.</span> <span id="s2907">I had to insure myself that she didn’t come from a family -- I had to know about their thinking, and whether they approved, or didn’t approve.</span> <span id="s2908">In this case, they approved of me in every way.</span> <span id="s2909">I had no problems with my in-laws, and on my side there was nobody left.</span> <span id="s2910">So with my wife, particularly, I found somebody that not only felt deeply with me, she -- although she had no experience of her own, but she did have experiences between democracy and Communism, because she lived in East Germany, and not very far from where I escaped, and she left also, illegally, East Germany for West Germany.</span> <span id="s2911">Her father was a teacher, and he decided on the -- well, even before Communism, under the Prussian rulers, that all his children are going to be school teachers.</span> <span id="s2912">And my wife was not willing -- she was not willing to become a school teacher, and be taught where to taught, and what to teach.</span> <span id="s2913">She also wanted to become a teacher.</span> <span id="s2914">So she left when there was still time, and crossed the border illegally.</span> <span id="s2915">There was no war up here in Berlin, that was early in the game.</span> <span id="s2916">And it was very interesting, her town, and her territory was about -- was Russian occupied for -- no, I’m sorry, was a -- American occupied, but first the Nazis were there, then the American troops owa, and then Eisenhower signed some papers where the demarcation line on the border would be, and the part that she was in was turned over to the Russians.</span> <span id="s2917">So the Americans went in first, occupied it, and then turn over to the Ru -- so she didn’t like it under Communism because of the teaching experience, and she left for Heidelberg.</span> <span id="s2918">Now, in Germany at that time, there was lack of worker people, and she could only stay if you came from the east, if you found a job.</span> <span id="s2919">So she found a job on a farm.</span> <span id="s2920">When she had money -- when she had [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2921">Michael?</span> <span id="s2922">Must be my wife.</span> <span id="s2923">I thought my son was there.</span> <span id="s2924">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2925">So she left for Heidelberg, got herself a job -- oh, she’s going someplace.</span> <span id="s2926">I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s2927">I didn’t know it.</span> <span id="s2928">She worked, and she studied.</span> <span id="s2929">When I met her, she didn’t work on a farm any more, she knew enough English, and she attend the Heidelberg University’s English Institute, where they taught English, proper English.</span> <span id="s2930">So her English was very good, and she wound up at a job in the American headquarters where I was working in Heidelberg.</span> <span id="s2931">And she worked as a clerk, and then when she had enough money, she went back to the university.</span> <span id="s2932">So when I met her, she was working of course, beca -- and we dated.</span></p> <p><span id="s2933">Q: Yeah, you had talked about that, but my question was, when did you tell her about the very difficult moments of your war time experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s2934">A: [indecipherable] that is very interesting, your question.</span> <span id="s2935">And also the way it went.</span> <span id="s2936">At first I appeared to her in American officer’s uniform.</span> <span id="s2937">And nobody expected me to have been in concentration camp.</span> <span id="s2938">As a matter of fact, only one time I was called in front of a general in Heidelberg, they plate -- and they were doing a parade, when some German generals came to visit the American headquarters, all the officers and staff, on the general’s staff, had to be outside, and watch the parade, and when the American flag came by, and we had to salute.</span> <span id="s2939">And when the German flag came by, we had to salute.</span> <span id="s2940">That was no problem for me, but when they played the German national anthem, I’m sorry to say the German national anthem today, is not the same words that -- that exist under Hitler, but the melody is the same, and I could not salute while they were playing the German national anthem, because in the concentration camp one time, I witnessed a -- hang a couple of people, and they played the German national anthem.</span> <span id="s2941">So there was a photo taken of the officers saluting, and someone said, “How come Willner is not saluting?”</span> <span id="s2942">And some officer said, “Oh, you’ll have to excuse him.</span> <span id="s2943">He knows why he’s not going to salute.”</span> <span id="s2944">He knew the reason.</span> <span id="s2945">Well, the final outcome, I was called to the general’s office, and he said, “I’m not going to dress you down.</span> <span id="s2946">You were supposed to salute like everybody else, but next time -- I know your background, we not holding against you.</span> <span id="s2947">I can feel your feelings.</span> <span id="s2948">Just don’t show up.</span> <span id="s2949">We have to do this, whether we like it or not, and I don’t feel -- to make you do it would not be the right thing.”</span> <span id="s2950">So we got some very good understanding there.</span> <span id="s2951">Far as my wife is concerned, it’s a lot of long story.</span> <span id="s2952">She didn’t know my background, and I actually met her in Heidelberg, there was a trial of an SS.</span></p> <p><span id="s2953">Q: Yeah, you had talked about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2954">A: So we know that.</span> <span id="s2955">After that, I think that the question of Nazism, and anti-Semitism -- in -- where she lived, she didn’t know any Jews, so they couldn’t -- would not say anything about that, but my wife is today more Jewish than I am.</span> <span id="s2956">I coo --</span></p> <p><span id="s2957">Q: M-M-My question was when did you then tell her -- when did you finally reveal to her the very painful moments?</span></p> <p><span id="s2958">A: About three months after I met her.</span> <span id="s2959">And we met probably, on most evenings after work.</span> <span id="s2960">And that means [indecipherable] three months I wanted to marry her, because of this -- that she didn’t know who I was, or ba -- and I questioned her, what she thought about all these things that happened during the war.</span> <span id="s2961">And every one was very satisfactory to me.</span> <span id="s2962">And they were not made up by some -- as some people did that liked to tell you what you like to hear.</span></p> <p><span id="s2963">Q: Well, let’s get onto your children now.</span> <span id="s2964">When did you begin to tell them what happened to you during the war?</span> <span id="s2965">Did you wait for them to ask you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2966">A: No.</span> <span id="s2967">They were told when I -- when they going to Jewish Sunday school at Fort Belbar, which is a military Jewish Sunday school [indecipherable] was a rabbi, and a military chaplain.</span> <span id="s2968">And some that were Orthodox, sometime Reformed.</span> <span id="s2969">They went 10 years, each one of them to Fort Belbar, which is near Washington.</span> <span id="s2970">So each one of our children had 10 years of Jewish education, but somewhere during that time, when they were old enough -- not when they were six years old, or five years old, I told them about the Holocaust, and my background.</span> <span id="s2971">And so they all found out, I would say, n -- in the range of seven, eight years, or nine years, and more and more I told them all what they wanted to know, and they always questioned, and I gave some talks in the Sunday school, which they also listened to.</span> <span id="s2972">But they were fully aware of my background, and their mother’s background, and the fact that my children would not believe, when Bar Mitzvah time came along that the Orthodox rabbi would not recognize them as being Jewish, because the mother was not Jewish.</span> <span id="s2973">I explained that.</span> <span id="s2974">And they could not believe it.</span> <span id="s2975">They believed the Holocaust, but they could not believe that the mother was not Jewish, and -- because she went with -- with us to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s2976">She knows how to read Hebrew.</span> <span id="s2977">As a matter of fact, she knew more than the average Jewish wife, which was not at my request, she did on her own.</span></p> <p><span id="s2978">Q: How did your wife -- or did she -- educate the children about the Holocaust?</span> <span id="s2979">Was it different than the way you did?</span></p> <p><span id="s2980">A: No, I did that.</span> <span id="s2981">I did all that, because I was a f-first witness to this, she was not, and she -- she knew about concentration camps, she had heard about it, that’s about all.</span> <span id="s2982">Like most Germans had, my age or older.</span> <span id="s2983">I cannot accept, for instance, that the Germans tell to me, somebody my age or older, that they didn -- he didn’t know there was such thing as concentration camp.</span> <span id="s2984">Because they themselves were afraid of going to concentration camps.</span> <span id="s2985">It wasn’t just Jews that were in there.</span> <span id="s2986">And as far as my wife is concerned, before she met me, she knew about concentration camps from reading the newspaper, not from [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2987">I was the first one she met that was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2988">Q: So it was you, you said, who was the one to educate your children about this, rather than your wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s2989">A: Right.</span> <span id="s2990">And to some extent, some of those teachers in school [indecipherable] in school, but they didn’t give a good account of it, because they only told them what [indecipherable] was.</span> <span id="s2991">So my -- my children, all of them, have a very deep understanding of the Holocaust by now of course, they’re much, much older.</span> <span id="s2992">As a matter of fact, I don’t know if I mentioned this before, but my oldest son, who is a lieutenant colonel, and who -- it’s something I didn’t mention at that time, because it didn’t exist, he is now a professor at West Point, teaching young cadets.</span> <span id="s2993">And I’m sure he talks about the Holocaust too, because he -- that’s not his main subject, his main subject’s for international relations, foreign affairs, and politics.</span> <span id="s2994">And he’s very mach -- much aware of the Holocaust, all his children are, and he has marched, in the deep winter, for 14 days, all by himself, the same march that we called the Death March, from Blechhammer to Gross-Rosen.</span> <span id="s2995">He marched that.</span> <span id="s2996">That’s the one that’s at West Point.</span> <span id="s2997">I am glad to have somebody like him up there.</span> <span id="s2998">If he is going to be asked any question, he knows all the answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s2999">Q: Wh-What is his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s3000">A: Albert Willner.</span> <span id="s3001">And I have some more information I want to tell you about him, because I’m real proud of him.</span> <span id="s3002">I -- in a way, not -- not more proud than the other children, because the others didn’t have the chance to do what he did, and Albert, I like to maybe elaborate a little bit later about Albert and his past, not just about the concentration camp, but how he fared in the military so far.</span> <span id="s3003">And he just moved from Washington a couple of mo -- two months ago, to West Point.</span></p> <p><span id="s3004">Q: Before we get to your children, and I do want to ask you about that later on, after you finished with the army, you were in the army for 20 years, I understand, then you worked for -- was it the federal government, and if so, what position did you occupy?</span></p> <p><span id="s3005">A: Yes, I worked for the federal government for another 20 years -- 20 years in the army, and you have a possibility when you -- you get your 20 years credit, then you go into civil serv -- or you take separate [indecipherable] for 20 years in the army.</span> <span id="s3006">I decided to f -- retire from the army, go into the reserves, and -- which I did, and then -- then working for -- in federal civil service for another 20 years.</span> <span id="s3007">I applied, I took a test, what they call a mid-level test to place you someplace.</span> <span id="s3008">It was a 10 hour test, plus the fact that I was an officer in the army, they give you extra point per the -- the schools you went to.</span> <span id="s3009">So [indecipherable] point, so finally I retired [indecipherable] from the federal government, also after 20 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s3010">Q: What department did you work for?</span></p> <p><span id="s3011">A: I worked in an outfit that’s not well known.</span> <span id="s3012">It’s called the International Statistical Program Center.</span> <span id="s3013">It’s located with the Bureau of the Census.</span> <span id="s3014">Now, most of the people are statisticians, who are borrowed from Bureau of the Census for this organization.</span> <span id="s3015">And there was an organization, couple of hundred people, still exists today, and it’s called the International Statistical Program, ISPC.</span></p> <p><span id="s3016">Q: So do you have a statistical background?</span></p> <p><span id="s3017">A: No, I don’t.</span> <span id="s3018">That was my problem.</span> <span id="s3019">I don’t have a sta -- and I really don’t care about statistics, but I did have a language [indecipherable] and I put that to good use.</span> <span id="s3020">Th-There was the French needed in there, Spanish I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s3021">German I didn’t know, and I handled all the correspon -- correspondence.</span> <span id="s3022">And all the incoming mail, and all the incoming newspapers from foreign countries, they were wanted by the US government, and I distribute them to the people that had a need to know.</span> <span id="s3023">That’s open information, newspaper.</span> <span id="s3024">So people who saw me in the morning, sitting at my desk, reading newspaper for two hours, they always felt I had the best job in there.</span> <span id="s3025">How can he get away with this?</span> <span id="s3026">He doesn’t do any work, he’s reading the paper.</span> <span id="s3027">That was part of my job.</span> <span id="s3028">It’s very interesting, I had some very interesting people I worked for, and part of this work, I must -- to be frank about it, I think [indecipherable] part of this was paid for by the CIA.</span> <span id="s3029">And there was what you call contract work.</span> <span id="s3030">So the Bureau of the Census has this section I was in, ISPC, which was not a -- not a CIA organization, but like I said, there are statisticians there, and people -- demographers, and people who are very familiar with international commerce.</span> <span id="s3031">And so th -- it was a

id="s3034">My boss was Jewish one time, [indecipherable] for 10 years.</span> <span id="s3035">He was a nice guy.</span> <span id="s3036">And actual anti-Semitism, no, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s3037">I had no problem there.</span></p> <p><span id="s3038">Q: Did you stay in this one position for the 20 years?</span></p> <p><span id="s3039">A: No.</span> <span id="s3040">I stayed for 14 years in the same position.</span> <span id="s3041">There was a big riff.</span> <span id="s3042">800 people got riffed.</span> <span id="s3043">And I was supposed to get riffed, and lucky for me I spoke two foreign lang -- there was a provision made in the riff orders, anybody who speaks two or more foreign language -- many people could speak one foreign language.</span> <span id="s3044">Anybody who speaks two or more foreign language fluent -- and is a language that being used, they will be placed in another position, they will not be riffed.</span> <span id="s3045">I was the only one that wound up in the po -- in -- in -- not being riffed.</span> <span id="s3046">But I was placed in the position for the next six years -- like I said, I made the 20 years civil service, and 14 in one position, and after I got riffed, I was put in another position, where I wouldn’t have to be a statistician.</span> <span id="s3047">And I pushed the statistician out of his job [indecipherable] riff procedures, who knew all about it, and then had to work under me, at one grade less, and was a terrible situation.</span> <span id="s3048">I tried to get out of it, you know, the poor guy, he knew I was not at fault, but people were understanding.</span> <span id="s3049">After two years my big boss said he didn’t want me to leave the civil service with a bitter taste in my mouth.</span> <span id="s3050">He meant statistics.</span> <span id="s3051">It wasn’t my fault I didn’t know anything about them.</span> <span id="s3052">And anyway, I finished my next four years in another job, which I had [indecipherable] statistic, as supervisor.</span></p> <p><span id="s3053">Q: What -- what languages did you speak?</span></p> <p><span id="s3054">A: French and German.</span> <span id="s3055">I also know Dutch, some Spanish.</span></p> <p><span id="s3056">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s3057">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Eddie Willner.</span> <span id="s3058">This is tape number one, side B. And we were talking about your government career.</span> <span id="s3059">So then you stayed in the government for 20 years, and when did you retire?</span></p> <p><span id="s3060">A: I retired in 1968 for the first time, ’88 the second time, from the civil service.</span> <span id="s3061">The first time from the military, in ’68, after 20 years, and I stayed another 20 years in s -- regular civil service, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s3062">Q: And then what did you -- did you do anything professionally after 1988?</span></p> <p><span id="s3063">A: No, I volunteered.</span> <span id="s3064">I am very proud to say I served the public, in the city of Falls Church, mainly.</span> <span id="s3065">We have several organizations here which are selected, or appointed, or elected by the city of Falls Church, and I got myself into an organization that was called Law Enforcement and Human Relations Advisory Commission.</span> <span id="s3066">And I was selected by the city council.</span> <span id="s3067">Three people interview you, and you either get the job [indecipherable] and you make it to be appointed.</span> <span id="s3068">I have been the s -- longest serving member of that organization in Falls Church, and I recently -- I was going to say retired, it’s a non-paying job, of course.</span> <span id="s3069">And I felt I should do something for the city, they were good to me, or to the United States, and I did that, too.</span> <span id="s3070">I taught peop -- foreigners how to speak English.</span> <span id="s3071">At 7:30 in the morning, people that were employed otherwise here, and the main job, like I said, was public safety with that commission, and I served for almost 21 years on the commission.</span> <span id="s3072">I resigned from it.</span> <span id="s3073">I’m happy to say my youngest son took my place.</span> <span id="s3074">But unfortunately, he has to change schools pretty soon, he’s going to [indecipherable] back to Georgetown for foreign affairs for a Master’s in foreign affairs, and he [indecipherable] to be the recipient of a scholarship for one year for another Master’s degree in national security affairs.</span> <span id="s3075">And he goes to that place paid for.</span> <span id="s3076">You get a regular salary, but you’re going to school for a year, and he’s just started that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3077">Q: And his name is?</span></p> <p><span id="s3078">A: His name is Michael Willner.</span></p> <p><span id="s3079">Q: You had touched on in a previous interview, some thoughts about food and what it meant to you.</span> <span id="s3080">When you were in the army, I think you had mentioned some -- you don’t like to see food wasted --</span></p> <p><span id="s3081">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3082">Q: -- because -- can you talk a little bit about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s3083">A: [indecipherable] only one thing that comes to my mind, a little -- the almost [indecipherable] I created in the army.</span> <span id="s3084">I -- I don’t like to see foods wasted, and one time in the army, when I was a lieutenant, the mess officer got sick, he had to go in the hospital for a week, and some superior officer came to me, and said for -- he wanted me to fill in for one week til this guy gets back on, as a mess officer.</span> <span id="s3085">And this was a huge mess hall cona -- called a consolidated mess hall at Camp Killmer, New Jersey.</span> <span id="s3086">And it fed about 2,000 men, so it’s a real big operation.</span> <span id="s3087">And I saw the food that was being wasted there.</span> <span id="s3088">So I hung up some big signs, take all you want, eat all you take.</span> <span id="s3089">In other words, you didn’t have to take the food they were giving you on your plate, they went through the line.</span> <span id="s3090">And it didn’t work, so the guys were still -- I told the cooks, “Don’t put so much on their plates, they can’t eat what you put.”</span> <span id="s3091">And if -- so some of them paid [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s3092">And I told the men, “Don’t take it, even if they want to give it to you, say take some off.”</span> <span id="s3093">Well, it didn’t work, so I -- I came to a concl -- I -- I was very -- it really bothered me, all this food being wasted.</span></p> <p><span id="s3094">Q: Wh-Why did it bother you?</span></p> <p><span id="s3095">A: Well, because some people were still hungry in this world.</span> <span id="s3096">Not because I saw people hungry only, but there were still many countries -- even in our country.</span> <span id="s3097">I arranged one time here in Washington, at the officer’s club at Fort Meyer, to send some food that was leftover to the old people’s home.</span> <span id="s3098">You don’t say old people’s home any more, but senior citizens, or whatever.</span> <span id="s3099">So we can all just do something about it.</span> <span id="s3100">In the army it was just well, when I asked for some leftover for my dogs, they packed up a whole roast for my dog.</span> <span id="s3101">Well, I -- I said, that whole roast could be -- there are no meals at night, people who work night shift, they don’t get fed, the mess hall is closed, only in the day is open.</span> <span id="s3102">You can cut up some sandwiches for them, and help themselves.</span> <span id="s3103">And you have some leftovers spoil, then you can throw it away.</span> <span id="s3104">But they had refrigerators, and just everything was there.</span> <span id="s3105">But anyway, it bothered me because I saw so many people hungry in the war, and I was hungry.</span> <span id="s3106">And the final outcome was that after trying everything else, I stood at the end of the line when they cleaning their plates.</span> <span id="s3107">They just shove their leftovers into a big vat, and then put into a machine, and machine cleans their tray.</span> <span id="s3108">I made guys go back who had too much food on their plate, I made them go back to the table and eat.</span> <span id="s3109">And somebody said to the officer on duty that they had in Camp Killmer, New Jersey, and he came over, and he took me aside, and he said, “Lieutenant Willner, I understand why you are doing this, but you cannot do it here.</span> <span id="s3110">This is -- this -- this one of the freedoms we have, they can take it or leave it, like many other things.</span> <span id="s3111">And besides, we have so much food, we’re not hungry.</span> <span id="s3112">I know there are hungry people in the world, n -- but not right here at Camp Killmer.</span> <span id="s3113">And we -- if they want to waste it, that’s up to them.”</span></p> <p><span id="s3114">Q: Were you more sensitive to this because of what you experienced during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s3115">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s3116">Of course I was more sensitive.</span> <span id="s3117">I just couldn’t see it, th-the food being wasted.</span> <span id="s3118">And I -- I did get some comments from some people who were maybe foreign born, most of them, who came to me and they said, “I like what you did, Lieutenant, and the [indecipherable].”</span> <span id="s3119">But the majority had no understanding, th-they just didn’t care, or they were never hungry.</span> <span id="s3120">There were a couple of people from maybe some -- Montana or pl -- some out of the way place, who didn’t have all this nice, solid food, who ate poorly at home, who didn’t have much money.</span> <span id="s3121">They had a little understanding for this.</span> <span id="s3122">They were more appreciative.</span> <span id="s3123">But if you were -- if you are never hungry in your life, you always had plenty of food.</span></p> <p><span id="s3124">Q: Did this affect you when you were raising your children, your attitude towards food?</span></p> <p><span id="s3125">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s3126">But I had no problem with my children.</span> <span id="s3127">I said, “You have to eat what is in your plate.”</span> <span id="s3128">I always made my children eat everything on the plate.</span> <span id="s3129">And all that would say, “I don’t want so much.”</span> <span id="s3130">I don’t [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s3131">So we took it back, or eat it the next day.</span> <span id="s3132">But we had no problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s3133">Q: Did you ever make your children go hungry, to experience what you did?</span></p> <p><span id="s3134">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s3135">Against the wishes of my wife, who was also hungry during the war, I not -- the first time I did this was I made them go to school without breakfast.</span></p> <p><span id="s3136">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s3137">A: Because the night before, and a couple of nights before, I bought pictures home of hungry people, skeletons walking around, children in Africa and some other place.</span> <span id="s3138">And I showed these to my children, and I said, “That’s why I want you to eat everything.</span> <span id="s3139">These people would be lucky if they could lick your plate after you’re finished.”</span> <span id="s3140">And so I was very strict on that, and I did that one more time, I did it at suppertime.</span> <span id="s3141">Let them go to bed hungry.</span> <span id="s3142">I figured the only way you can understand what is -- but I decided later on that’s not going to work.</span> <span id="s3143">They know they’re going to get a meal the next day, and the people who were hungry don’t have that advantage.</span></p> <p><span id="s3144">Q: What was your children’s reaction when you did this?</span></p> <p><span id="s3145">A: They -- they understood.</span> <span id="s3146">They understood why I was doing it.</span> <span id="s3147">There no problem, there was no problem.</span> <span id="s3148">They were of an age that they understood, and they had -- they a-average readers, they look at the newspapers, and I always brought home pictures of people that were hungry, always, for probably years.</span></p> <p><span id="s3149">Q: When you first got here to the United States, did you feel that people understood what you had gone through?</span> <span id="s3150">Did you feel they respected you for what you had gone through?</span></p> <p><span id="s3151">A: The people I worked with, and the people I --</span></p> <p><span id="s3152">Q: The people you came in contact with when you first came to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s3153">A: No, there wasn’t that much [indecipherable], occa -- in the military yes, there was more of an understanding than the civil service.</span> <span id="s3154">In the military we much closer to each other.</span> <span id="s3155">And there were people that went through combat in World War two, who saw some of the camps.</span> <span id="s3156">Or people in -- were in Japan, prisoner of war.</span> <span id="s3157">I got much more understanding sa -- from the military.</span> <span id="s3158">The older ones, the ones that stayed in, not the draftee World War two, he was out already, but people who were professionals, either officer, or enlisted men, didn’t make any difference, there were many -- oh, there was even one that I remember who came from a family, he was very poor, Italian family, and he said, “I -- I -- I like what you’re doing lieutenant, cause I -- I grew up hungry.”</span> <span id="s3159">So that was the extent of the conversation, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s3160">Q: Did you, when you got here to the United States, did you search out for other people who were survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s3161">A: No.</span> <span id="s3162">When I found out occasionally that somebody was, I would say hello, and Mr. Kernic probably is the only one, coincidentally, we met, found out we were in the same camp.</span> <span id="s3163">We didn’t know each other in camp.</span> <span id="s3164">And as -- outside him, I’ve met one or two that I knew in Heidelberg.</span> <span id="s3165">I met one one time from Poland, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s3166">Q: When -- when you would get together, would you talk about your -- y-your experiences to each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s3167">A: I’m sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s3168">Q: When you met these people, would you talk about your wartime experiences with each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s3169">A: Yes, Mr. Kernic, yes.</span> <span id="s3170">Mr. Kernic is an exception because he does not look at only the bad things, which -- I’m the same way.</span> <span id="s3171">We can laugh together about some experience we had.</span> <span id="s3172">How we got away with something.</span> <span id="s3173">There was one particular instance, there was an SS officer, who was from the Rhineland, from -- near Cologne.</span> <span id="s3174">Now that’s where I came from.</span> <span id="s3175">And he asked me something one day, he didn’t hit me.</span> <span id="s3176">And he asked Mr. Kernic one time [indecipherable] just ow -- he told me this after the war, here in Washington, and -- that he was called -- we didn’t know his -- not by his real name, but they called him Tom Mix, because he’s wearing his pistol cowboy style, a little bit to the side, hanging down.</span> <span id="s3177">And he shot people.</span> <span id="s3178">And Tom Mix was a guy about, I don’t know, 25 years old maybe, but he hated Austrians, particularly Viennese, with a Viennese accent, and Mr. Kernic has a Viennese accent.</span> <span id="s3179">And every time he saw him, he asked him something, he answered with a Viennese ac -- he hit him in his face.</span> <span id="s3180">I said, “Oh you -- I didn’t have that problem,” maybe cause I he -- where I came from, but that wasn’t because he liked Jews that much, maybe [indecipherable] a boy, and I grew up very strict, my father disciplined, and when he came I stood at attention.</span> <span id="s3181">Maybe Viennese people, they didn’t have so much discipline like German Jews.</span> <span id="s3182">And I think Kernic agrees with me, that’s probably was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3183">Q: What is Mr. Kernic’s first name?</span> <span id="s3184">Which camp was he in with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s3185">A: He was in Blechhammer, which was also called Auschwitz three, which he told me, I didn’t even know -- never knew, a -- but he did a lot of research.</span></p> <p><span id="s3186">Q: Did you have any kind of language barrier when you came here to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s3187">A: No.</span> <span id="s3188">I spoke English before I came here.</span> <span id="s3189">English, French and Dutch.</span></p> <p><span id="s3190">Q: How did you know the English?</span></p> <p><span id="s3191">A: Little bit in school, most of it in -- in the army, when I was liberated, and I stayed with the army for six months.</span> <span id="s3192">That’s where I picked up most of my English.</span></p> <p><span id="s3193">Q: Do you --</span></p> <p><span id="s3194">A: And by the way, Kernic’s name is Ernest.</span> <span id="s3195">I call him Ernie, I was thinking about it w -- it’s Ernest.</span> <span id="s3196">Ernest Kernic.</span></p> <p><span id="s3197">Q: Do you think you are a different person because of what you went through in the war, and the losses --</span></p> <p><span id="s3198">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3199">Q: -- and the losses that you’ve had.</span></p> <p><span id="s3200">A: I don’t know what I would have been, or become, what profession.</span> <span id="s3201">I think I really was too young.</span> <span id="s3202">I could say, well, like some people say, I wanted to become a doctor.</span> <span id="s3203">I never had that in my mind, and you go by maybe a member of the family.</span> <span id="s3204">I was too young, I think, I was -- I left, actually, my parents home when I was 11.</span> <span id="s3205">I went to Belgium, I was without my parents.</span> <span id="s3206">My father just put me on a train, got me out of Germany, after the Crystal Night.</span> <span id="s3207">So that question never came up, even when I lived with the Dutch people.</span> <span id="s3208">I -- I don’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s3209">Q: W-Was there a time in your life when you resisted thinking about what you had -- when you tried to put it away from your life, resisted thinking about what you had gone through, and the losses that you’ve had?</span></p> <p><span id="s3210">A: Oh, I tried it several time.</span> <span id="s3211">You have to l-live -- learn to live with it, and to the -- your experiences, some are even valuable for the rest of your life, some of them, you forget about it, and there’s some things the b -- I learned in the camps that are certainly not usable on the outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s3212">Q: Such as?</span> <span id="s3213">A: Well, little things -- making things, for instance.</span> <span id="s3214">I make a lot of little things, I invent a lot of little things.</span> <span id="s3215">I am outside [indecipherable] upstairs [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s3216">I cannot lift up my leg because I have Parkinson’s very much, so I build something.</span> <span id="s3217">All these little thing I learn because of the camp.</span> <span id="s3218">But they have very little use outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s3219">Q: Are you more comfortable around other survivors than people who have not gone through this?</span></p> <p><span id="s3220">A: Am I more comfortable with what?</span></p> <p><span id="s3221">Q: Are you more comfortable-ble around people who are also survivors than people who are not?</span></p> <p><span id="s3222">A: No.</span> <span id="s3223">No, no.</span> <span id="s3224">No, no.</span> <span id="s3225">The only problem I have with people who continuously cry about who they lost, and -- and who I don’t want to be exposed to.</span> <span id="s3226">I lost also, by official count, by official document, there were 28 Willners, tha -- my father’s name, who went in, I’m the only one who came back.</span> <span id="s3227">But I don’t continuously talk about it, but I made up something that’s sitting up there for anybody who doesn’t know, but they can read on the pa -- I don’t want to tell the story each time.</span> <span id="s3228">So I have the names, birthdays, birthplace, and where they lived.</span> <span id="s3229">So I -- I don’t want -- frankly, I decided, after your interview, probably, not to get interview again, because it’s enough.</span> <span id="s3230">Enough is enough.</span> <span id="s3231">I -- it’s like opening old wounds, and some of them, I -- I don’t want to be reminded of it all the time.</span> <span id="s3232">I want to live a normal life.</span> <span id="s3233">I want my children to live a normal life.</span> <span id="s3234">And I think I gave them enough to -- not to forget, to be very conscious of it.</span> <span id="s3235">My oldest son -- my father had an iron cross which he won during World War one, in the German army, and I gave that to my oldest son because he’s an army officer, but besides that, he has stuff -- things hanging in his office that -- has his grandfather iron cross, and some other stories about him.</span> <span id="s3236">One particular story is not about him, but is about me, a one page thing.</span> <span id="s3237">And it’s written up by the federal government here, and it’s a very short story, but it tells my story.</span> <span id="s3238">And I don’t want to go into big story, but he has that framed in his office.</span> <span id="s3239">And he was, for awhile, the commanding officer of a heli -- attack helicopter p -- unit.</span> <span id="s3240">Cobra attack helicopters, before he went to the teaching business.</span> <span id="s3241">That’s what a young officer has to do something to get ahead maybe, and he wanted to be combat officer.</span> <span id="s3242">And he had young pilots come into his office, they had problems with their nerves, they were shaky after certain flights.</span> <span id="s3243">Not combat flight, but helicopter not working properly, being up in the air, trying to get down, save your life.</span> <span id="s3244">And jumping out of a helicopter, and five seconds later it was on fire.</span> <span id="s3245">So these guys had problems dealing with this.</span> <span id="s3246">And most people who go into this know that, that that might come up.</span> <span id="s3247">Well, I’m sure my son had problems, but he doesn’t let it get ahold of him too much.</span> <span id="s3248">He had a young officer come in, and one day told him that he had a problem, that he doesn’t know if he can go on flying.</span> <span id="s3249">He’s not sure of himself any more.</span> <span id="s3250">And he said, “Please go over there to the wall, read that story.”</span> <span id="s3251">He didn’t tell him that was his father, and the guy read the story, and my son said to him -- he t-told me this -- “You think you have problems?”</span> <span id="s3252">He said, “No, sir.”</span> <span id="s3253">He said, “Okay, if you re -- you really have problems, you come and see me again.</span> <span id="s3254">I don’t think you have any problem.”</span></p> <p><span id="s3255">Q: You said that -- that this will probably be the -- you’re not going to be interviewed after this, and my question to you --</span></p> <p><span id="s3256">A: Excuse me [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s3257">Yeah, I need something.</span> <span id="s3258">Yeah, please [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s3259">Q: Do you have any special kind of dreams, or have your dreams changed since the war time?</span></p> <p><span id="s3260">A: Well, I used to have a lot of dreams in about -- a couple of years ago, about the concentration camps, about some serious pictures of people hanging themselves, so -- because where I was in last camp, Langenstein, that happened very much, people gave up.</span> <span id="s3261">And so I used to wake up in a sweat, thinking about it, but because I got so busy with my children, all kind of activities, I started slowly getting away from the dreams.</span> <span id="s3262">And at this time, the dreams were, let’s say about 10 - 20 years ago, about three times a week, on the average.</span> <span id="s3263">Dreaming about camps, sometimes even more.</span> <span id="s3264">I dream now once or twice a month, and not so bad, because I had, two months ago hallucinations, but not about the camps, that’s because of Parkinson’s.</span> <span id="s3265">And they giving me too much medication, and I was losing some weight, and I was overdose.</span> <span id="s3266">So I two nights -- one time, one night was the -- I had to go with ambulance, but that turned out to be nothing serious, except that they reduce [indecipherable] medication.</span> <span id="s3267">So, coming back to the camps, I got used to it after awhile, but I lost a lot of sleep over it, but I wake up, and then -- but the main thing that happened, getting away from there is my wife, keep me busy, doing a lot of things for me, and our children.</span> <span id="s3268">My wife knowingly why she was doing this, and I didn’t want to involve my children, getting something for the -- they -- I -- I also keep away from them, and I want them to keep away from me things.</span> <span id="s3269">If I have something bad happens for the day, something’s -- maybe, let’s say something -- something which says something about being a Jew, or -- or being anti-Semitic, that would hurt me.</span> <span id="s3270">But it depends who it comes from.</span> <span id="s3271">If it’s from a private citizen, I don’t give a damn, frankly.</span> <span id="s3272">He can go and I -- I’ll be very blunt, and I -- and if it’s somebody intelligent, who is maybe my boss, or somebody higher up, or in the papers, I get upset about it.</span> <span id="s3273">So my children come across something like that, they want to tell me about it, they know not to tell me that evening they come home, or when they used to come home.</span> <span id="s3274">Next morning, that’s okay.</span> <span id="s3275">I don’t want to hear anything bad in the evening, same thing for my wife.</span> <span id="s3276">If she got a phone call, I was supposed to see somebody next day for a new job, or for something important, an investment, or something like that, I am -- wa -- she wouldn’t know -- don’t -- if it’s good news, you can tell me, if it’s bad news, you keep it to yourself, tell it to me morning at breakfast time.</span> <span id="s3277">And it worked pretty well.</span> <span id="s3278">Because you tell me in the evening something bad, I can’t sleep.</span> <span id="s3279">It’s unfortunate, but it doesn’t have to be about anti-Sem -- it could be about anything, any bad news.</span></p> <p><span id="s3280">Q: As you’ve gotten older, do you think more about your wartime experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s3281">A: No.</span> <span id="s3282">I -- I tell you why.</span> <span id="s3283">I’m trying to think why I’m saying this.</span> <span id="s3284">I do occasionally, in a free moment, think about the [indecipherable] that’s the way it was, or the way it went.</span> <span id="s3285">It’s because my children, they keep me so busy, with all their good news all the time, that I can’t think only bad news.</span> <span id="s3286">That’s really a fact.</span> <span id="s3287">And really the pleasure, they grew into this.</span> <span id="s3288">My youngest son, who is back to school now, he comes back home, he usually has good news in the evening, had a good day.</span> <span id="s3289">If it’s a bad day, he won’t say anything about it [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s3290">Q: When -- when your children turned 11, which was the age that you left your family, did that bring -- was that a painful time for you?</span> <span id="s3291">Did it bring back memories of the time you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s3292">A: These were not painful times for me, no.</span> <span id="s3293">You mean at this time, to think about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s3294">Q: I was just saying when your children turned -- became the age that you were when you had to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s3295">A: No.</span> <span id="s3296">Not at all.</span> <span id="s3297">I think it strengthened my children in many respects.</span> <span id="s3298">I’m [indecipherable], and it’s not on purpose, but in -- in a way, it’s my doing, they look up to me.</span> <span id="s3299">I -- there are also some things in my life I haven’t told them.</span> <span id="s3300">Little things, no -- not very important things, not about concentration camp.</span> <span id="s3301">Little thing that happened, and I don’t bother them maybe an -- an older age.</span> <span id="s3302">For instance, one of my sons, I hit him a couple of times, just with my hand, I never hit him with a stick or a belt, or anything like that.</span> <span id="s3303">And if they did something that I punished one, and I punished the wrong one, another guy did it.</span> <span id="s3304">I would never hesitate go to my children, even 11 years old or something, and say, “I'm sorry I hit you, and you didn’t do it, or you did it, but I -- I still -- I didn’t want to hit you in the spur of the moment, I did.</span> <span id="s3305">I apologize for it.”</span> <span id="s3306">And I never thought myself too big to do that.</span> <span id="s3307">And I think the children appreciated it, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s3308">Q: Are you angry that you had to go through the terrible war experiences that you did, and other people, for instance, over here, didn’t have to?</span></p> <p><span id="s3309">A: No, not because other people didn’t have to, but my wife tells me -- matter of fact, we’ve talked about this morning, I’m somewhat still angry, in -- in my background, in my deeper -- inner -- inner -- in the -- I don’t know how to word this.</span> <span id="s3310">There’s some things in life that made me angry, and other people do, probably because of my co -- on prejudice, for instance.</span> <span id="s3311">Any kind of prejudice.</span> <span id="s3312">And -- doesn’t have to be anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s3313">I witnessed some prejudice in officer candidate school, Blacks, who were thrown out just because their color.</span> <span id="s3314">Jews also, but you -- but you couldn’t prove it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3315">Q: But my question was, there were people your age in this country who didn’t experience what you did in Europe.</span> <span id="s3316">Are you angry that you had to be the one to experience it, and not them?</span></p> <p><span id="s3317">A: Well, I’m still angry at some things that have -- not really related to the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s3318">I get angry at my wife at something, maybe, that went wrong.</span> <span id="s3319">And I said, “You should have known better.”</span> <span id="s3320">Has nothing to do with the concentration camp, but down deep is -- it goes back to the concentration camp, where I didn’t want to do anything wrong, because it will cost me my life, or a beating, something like that.</span> <span id="s3321">So there’s an anger there.</span> <span id="s3322">So we had something come up, a -- something very normal, and I got angry about it.</span> <span id="s3323">And I know that’s the type of anger that my wife objects to, because it’s not -- I don’t have to be angry about it, but I am.</span> <span id="s3324">It’s not the -- anything earthshaking.</span> <span id="s3325">Maybe not something [indecipherable], it may be just statement.</span> <span id="s3326">May -- I don’t want to be specific about something, but my wife makes a statement about something, and she doesn’t know much about it, maybe politics, or something, and then my son is disc -- discussing with her poli -- I’m just listening.</span> <span id="s3327">And I said, “How can you make such statement?</span> <span id="s3328">You don’t even know this guy, you don’t know about this guy.”</span> <span id="s3329">And that’s the anger that I get, that she shouldn’t say that because she doesn’t know this.</span> <span id="s3330">The same thing [indecipherable] my children.</span></p> <p><span id="s3331">Q: Well, how does that relate to your camp experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s3332">A: Like I said, it’s -- it’s something -- it’s an anger that’s still there from the camps.</span> <span id="s3333">That’s why [indecipherable] Dutchman, and we made a hell of a life.</span> <span id="s3334">We thought alike, very much alike.</span> <span id="s3335">But unfortunately I have to say in his case, it showed on the outside, not on the inside, he beat his wife, I found out.</span> <span id="s3336">She told me, and I -- I told him that he shouldn’t do this, and he never gave me an answer yes or no.</span> <span id="s3337">So he did had -- did have an anger, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s3338">Q: Did you feel that you lost part of your childhood that you’ve never gotten back?</span></p> <p><span id="s3339">A: I lost part of my childhood, and what?</span> <span id="s3340">Q: And -- and you’ve never gotten it back?</span></p> <p><span id="s3341">A: No.</span> <span id="s3342">I don’t -- I don’t think about that.</span> <span id="s3343">That’s true [indecipherable], I did.</span> <span id="s3344">I lost a good part of my childhood.</span> <span id="s3345">But I -- there -- best friends of my parents were German Jews who were -- escaped to Israel, just before the war started, and the daughter of these best friends of my parents, is -- the name of Inga Snitzler.</span> <span id="s3346">She lived in vi -- in Vienna.</span> <span id="s3347">The first [indecipherable] then they came here, after the parents died, she and her sister came here.</span> <span id="s3348">And I had a great childhood with her, because the parents were good friends.</span> <span id="s3349">Babysitter babysat for both her and me, and when you went in -- we were invited to Germany one time, she came also with her husband -- unfortunately he died recently, and he -- he didn’t want to go to Germany, and I didn’t want to either, I -- I was in Germany stationed, couple of years in the army, but the last trip was invited at the expense of the like [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s3350">And frankly, if I had to do it again, I wouldn’t do it, not because I didn’t get a good reception.</span></p> <p><span id="s3351">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s3352">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Eddie Willner.</span> <span id="s3353">This is tape number two, side A. And you had said that you wanted to talk about your children, so this is your chance.</span></p> <p><span id="s3354">A: Well, first of all I really should talk about my wife, who came before the children.</span> <span id="s3355">The -- not the extraordinary children, but the extraordinary wife, which I feel she is, and our oldest son -- first of all, we have six boys and -- no, I’m -- six children, three boys and three girls, and they range from 30 to 40.</span> <span id="s3356">So we had all of them within 10 years.</span> <span id="s3357">And they all accomplished already something in their life.</span> <span id="s3358">They all went to college.</span> <span id="s3359">Some of them have two degrees, some of them have Master’s, and one of them has -- the one in the army, the oldest one, has a Master’s, and a Ph.D., and is now teaching at West Point.</span> <span id="s3360">Now, Albert, that’s Albert Willner, th -- is 40, but I really don’t know where to start with his extraordinary accomplishments, and unusual interests, as the oldest of our children, like I said, three boys and three girls.</span> <span id="s3361">But before I start bragging about him, I should start at the source of all these, my wonderful wife, Johanna, a German born Protestant, without converting to Judaism, has been the most supportive in raising our children in the Jewish faith.</span> <span id="s3362">All of our children have had 10 years of Jewish education.</span> <span id="s3363">As for myself, any [indecipherable] believe in God, no matter what religion, is fine.</span> <span id="s3364">The most important thing is what’s in your heart.</span> <span id="s3365">Because of my past, and in memory of my parents, 28 members of my family, and so many who had to die just because they were Jews, I would always remain a Jew.</span> <span id="s3366">In summary, after my life -- after the concentration camps, the best rita gud machoum, if you understand what means.</span> <span id="s3367">It means restitution.</span> <span id="s3368">It’s not really the right word.</span> <span id="s3369">Was not much success, but the fact for the millions of people that perished, I was able to make up for the losses, if only one to one million.</span> <span id="s3370">Six million Jews -- some people ask me jokingly if I’m trying to make them all up again.</span> <span id="s3371">So, all I could is six.</span> <span id="s3372">And the -- like I said, the summary of my life after the concentration camps, the best [indecipherable] good amount of restitution was not my success, but the fact that for the millions of people that perished, I was able to make up some of the losses.</span> <span id="s3373">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s3374">My anger with God, and we talked about anger before, and this with God, being the only survivor of the Willner family, out of 28, has changed to thankfulness, permitting me to forgive God, and not the other way around.</span> <span id="s3375">I can truly say that my mission in life has been accomplished, and I will be able to peacefully rest some day among some of my liberators at Arlington National Cemetery.</span> <span id="s3376">I feel very strongly about that.</span> <span id="s3377">And that’s past life.</span> <span id="s3378">I can truly say that really, some of these men a-are known to me by name, but I know th-they died during World War two, that Arlington Cemetery, who paid with their lives, so that others like myself might live.</span> <span id="s3379">And every time I walk through Arlington, I know occasionally on some holiday, I put some flowers down, and some [indecipherable] of World War two soldier, and my oldest son does the same thing, we just go and [indecipherable] and we -- he was also married in the chapel [indecipherable] military by a non -- I forgot what they call it -- non-demonush -- demon -- denominational chaplain, army chaplain.</span> <span id="s3380">I feel that America is blessed with many things, and I think particularly -- I’m particularly thankful for the freedoms of speech, which has been especially meaningful for me, the freedom of speech.</span> <span id="s3381">I’m not talking about [indecipherable] but the most impressive thing that I still think about all the time, is freedom of speech.</span> <span id="s3382">I can say anything I want, and not have to worry, even when I had my government job.</span> <span id="s3383">I can say I don’t like this president, and I don’t have to worry about somebody standing at my door, and arresting me.</span> <span id="s3384">Well, now to Albert’s military career.</span> <span id="s3385">Albert, the oldest one -- and by the way, my wife and I agreed before we got married, that we would like to have probably four children, and soon, because we got married, both, at an old age.</span> <span id="s3386">I was 32 almost, and she was 30.</span> <span id="s3387">And religion was going to be no problem.</span> <span id="s3388">I only stated that I want my children to grow up with the Jewish religion, not because I’m so s -- going to the synagogue, keep all the things my faith asks of me, because my parents died as Jews.</span> <span id="s3389">In their memory, and my wife agreed, I felt if I had met another wife, who said, “Well I’m a Protestant, or a Catholic, but I got to [indecipherable] my faith,” she would have become Jewish, I would have asked her to, but -- but I felt that’s not necessary, like I said before.</span> <span id="s3390">What’s in -- what’s in your heart, that’s what’s important.</span> <span id="s3391">In her case, I knew particularly what was -- so Albert was born in Germany, then went to American schools, some overseas in Japan.</span> <span id="s3392">And finally he went to college here in the United States, and he got an ROTC schol -- ROTC scholar -- scholarship.</span> <span id="s3393">And he happened to come out as the number one man in his class, and the first man that the -- top man who gets the scholarship at that time -- not gets a scholarship, c-comes out on top, the first guy in his class, is offered a regular army commission, which is you can become a professional army officer.</span> <span id="s3394">And I told him to take it, if he didn’t like it, he can always leave the army later.</span> <span id="s3395">So I wasn’t aff -- afforded that opportunity, I came out a harder way, through officer candidate school.</span> <span id="s3396">I’m sorry, I have to drink some water first.</span> <span id="s3397">My voice is going out.</span> <span id="s3398">So, to make a real, real long story short, after I finish the ROTC, and he -- he majored in political science, and he went into the army, got a regular commission, then became a paratrooper, became a ranger, studied Chinese for three years, went to China for one year on an educational tour, just traveling around for one year.</span> <span id="s3399">Then became a -- what they call a foreign area officer, studies foreign areas, they must know the language.</span> <span id="s3400">And then he didn’t think that he should be just a soldier at a desk, he should be a combat soldier.</span> <span id="s3401">And I must say also, frankly, that I feel what happened in World War two, when Jews were not able to defend themselves, I didn’t want my children to be in a position -- you don’t know when it’s -- could happen.</span> <span id="s3402">There are people who would -- don’t like Jews, and I -- I think German Jews particularly have been criticized why they went to the places of killing, like sheep.</span> <span id="s3403">Well, nobody had a gun.</span> <span id="s3404">In Germany nobody owned a gun, my father didn’t own one, although my uncle owned a saber, which he brought back from World War two, but -- so I was very particular s -- I felt very strongly about getting a military education, in the same time serving your country, and seeing to it that we remain a democracy.</span> <span id="s3405">And the army can be responsible, to a certain extent, provided we have the right leaders.</span> <span id="s3406">And Albert went in, and then, since he wanted to become a combat soldier, not sit down and some -- somebody telling him, oh you’re just a desk officer, he went to attack helicopters, and he was -- he was taught to fly Cobra attack helicopters, which were very successful during several wars.</span> <span id="s3407">And then he became commander of -- of -- of the unit.</span> <span id="s3408">Then he got promoted to major, and then every officer who wants to stay in the army, ma-make the career today, must have a Master’s degree in one field or another.</span> <span id="s3409">So the army gave Albert 18 months to go to the University of Virginia, and get a Master’s degree within 18 months.</span> <span id="s3410">Well, again, to make a long story short, he finished his Master’s degree in foreign relations in nine months instead of 18 months.</span> <span id="s3411">So he -- one professor was Chinese, one of his three professors that he got close to.</span> <span id="s3412">He said, “Albert, you finished [indecipherable] what are you going to do now?”</span> <span id="s3413">“Well,” he said, “go back to the army.</span> <span id="s3414">Take whatever job they give me.”</span> <span id="s3415">“Well,” he said, “you are Ph.D. material, you know that.</span> <span id="s3416">So,” he said, “why don’t you stay on and we’ll be your sponsors.”</span> <span id="s3417">But he had to make request to the army, and the army said -- no, first the professor wrote the army.</span> <span id="s3418">We have a young officer here, who finished in a -- in eight -- in -- in nine months, when most people have 18 months to finish it.</span> <span id="s3419">Can he stay here and go on to a Ph.D.?</span> <span id="s3420">Well nobody can finish a Ph.D. in nine months, they knew that.</span> <span id="s3421">So he was told then, if he studies on his own afterwards, they’ll let him stay another nine months.</span> <span id="s3422">So he stayed another nine months at UVA, and he didn’t finish of course, but he studied very hard.</span> <span id="s3423">He was married already at that time, and his family left him alone at night when he was studying.</span> <span id="s3424">Well, make a -- he finished his Ph.D. in three years, and then the army send him to China, like I said, and then he went again into hel-helicopters, and when he finished that job, he needed a job th -- for further promotion, he got that in Germany for three years, and his -- then the next assignment was in Washington, the Pentagon.</span> <span id="s3425">He was the war plants officer for the Far East.</span> <span id="s3426">In other words, he was responsible for the planning if there was any attack in the Far East, in Japan, Korea, China.</span> <span id="s3427">That was the area of responsibility.</span> <span id="s3428">And he’s now a lieutenant colonel, and two years ago he was interviewed for teaching at West Point.</span> <span id="s3429">And it’s very difficult to get a professorship there, and there are two ways.</span> <span id="s3430">You can stay just for two years, on a regular assign -- or you can be -- ask to make it rest of your career.</span> <span id="s3431">If you do, you get a further promotion, you’re assured to leave the army as a one star general.</span> <span id="s3432">And so he went to West Point.</span> <span id="s3433">He loves it, his wife loves it.</span> <span id="s3434">They are living one block from the river, and his teaching is very nice, he likes it, he enjoy -- he always wanted to teach.</span> <span id="s3435">And I’m glad he did it, with his background.</span> <span id="s3436">And I mentioned to -- him before, in another part of the interview that he followed my Death March in Poland for one week -- for two -- for two weeks, and he retraced everything during the winter.</span> <span id="s3437">And he has many o-other endeavors that he did, pertaining to the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s3438">So it’s very close then he -- I don’t have to tell him.</span> <span id="s3439">He will -- he has now all of my papers that he will organize, and go through, and he [indecipherable] source with my family, if any [indecipherable] for the Holocaust, he has the records, and he will get the -- the interview tape, too.</span> <span id="s3440">So I’m very proud of Albert, he has accomplished enough, at a young age, and he’s a great guy, and he has done many things to his -- my -- for instance, for as far as mother’s concerned, on his birthday he delivers -- or has delivered flowers to his mother for having me born.</span> <span id="s3441">And they have a very good relationship with both father and mother.</span> <span id="s3442">And the worst thing that I am concerned with, that if ever I ha -- anything happens to me [indecipherable] children are good hands [indecipherable] why I was taken care of, but I am worried about having to go to an old people’s home one day.</span> <span id="s3443">I don’t think that will happen unless medically, it’s impossible to keep at home, because I have six children who will fight over having me in the house.</span> <span id="s3444">So anyway, that’s a good thought.</span> <span id="s3445">Whatever happens, now that’s another story.</span> <span id="s3446">And they will take care of their mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s3447">Q: Wh-What about your other children?</span></p> <p><span id="s3448">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s3449">We come to Nicole, our oldest daughter.</span> <span id="s3450">Our oldest daughter was impressed by older son’s beginnings in ROTC.</span> <span id="s3451">She didn’t have ROTC when she started college -- and by the way, I must explain about education.</span> <span id="s3452">I was a male chauvinist, I must admit that, coming from Europe, from Germany.</span> <span id="s3453">German, and whether Jewish or not, most men were sh -- male chauvinists.</span> <span id="s3454">And when I came to United States [indecipherable] start in having children, I thought, not having too much money, that the boys must go to college.</span> <span id="s3455">Well very soon my [indecipherable] by my wife, and m-my daughters, and I felt in -- marriages sometimes don’t last very long here.</span> <span id="s3456">The women have to have profession, too, so they can make their own living.</span> <span id="s3457">And I said, “Well, the money’s not going to have me split three ways to go to college, it’s going to be six ways from now on.”</span> <span id="s3458">So how do I do that?</span> <span id="s3459">Well, I know how much money was avail -- and I had no experience with college, because nobody had st -- had started yet, and Albert was going to start.</span> <span id="s3460">So I said, “One thing I’ll assure you of, the first year’s assured, for everybody.</span> <span id="s3461">I -- I pay for it.</span> <span id="s3462">After that you’re on your own.”</span> <span id="s3463">So I want to put a taste in their mouths what college is like, not to say I go to work first, and like I have a lot of people that let their children go to work for a year, and they make so much money, and they don’t want to get a college degree.</span> <span id="s3464">You know, why should I go to college, I can make more money not going?</span> <span id="s3465">So I didn’t want that to happen, since I like -- like the education.</span> <span id="s3466">I picked some up in the army, picked up a degree in the army, but not like my oldest son.</span> <span id="s3467">Because my main interest was a family, not -- not studying.</span> <span id="s3468">So some of them wound up with scholarships, or part scholar -- and I made sure that, of course, they started first year, that was on me, and anything else later on will have to be scholarships, or borrow money from a bank, or from me, if -- if -- if nothing -- if you don’t -- couldn’t get the money, but you pay me back, because we have to get some money for your mother to be on her own someday.</span> <span id="s3469">I don’t want her to be dependent on you.</span> <span id="s3470">I -- I want her to have enough to live on if something happens to me.</span> <span id="s3471">So they all agreed.</span> <span id="s3472">And I said, “If you need any money at the end of your college time, the fourth year, and the third year, and you can’t get any loans because your dad makes too much money, or whatever, you can borrow money from me, and no interest.</span> <span id="s3473">And you pay me back when you can, when you start working.”</span> <span id="s3474">And that’s what happened every one of them.</span> <span id="s3475">The three last ones owed me each -- I don’t know how much they owed me, but somewhere around 10,000 dollars each.</span> <span id="s3476">And I -- I agreed that -- like I said, no -- no interest.</span> <span id="s3477">If they can pay, they pay me back [indecipherable] hundred dollars a month.</span> <span id="s3478">And if they good -- good at it, paying back the money they owe me, said they owe me no interest.</span> <span id="s3479">I will let them off when I can afford to.</span> <span id="s3480">So as it turned out, the last three owed me about six, seven, 8,000 dollars, and I was at a point in time when I was making good money with the government, I said you all paid me back, what you could every month, and y -- I -- I wrote it off, you don’t owe me any money any more.</span> <span id="s3481">Because I could afford, there was nobody else going to college.</span> <span id="s3482">So they all understood, and they all were helping, and they were -- and they continue to do so.</span> <span id="s3483">So we go to Nina.</span> <span id="s3484">Nina, or Nicole, who is 39, the oldest daughter, is a terrific girl.</span> <span id="s3485">After she saw her mother doing these things in the military, and getting paid for it also, she volunteered after two years in college, to go out to ROTC.</span> <span id="s3486">In the meantime, her brother was a battalion commander, not really, but like -- but that the ROTC battalion commander.</span> <span id="s3487">And she got also a commission as a second lieutenant, and they gave me the honor to -- if I can appear in uniform, to be at the Pentagon, or at the college, and pin the bars on my daughter.</span> <span id="s3488">And so one side was her brother, and the other side was me, pinning second lieutenant bars on her.</span> <span id="s3489">So she became a captain in the army, then she met her husband, she was Intelligence in Berlin, very interesting career.</span> <span id="s3490">She was, since she studied psychology, they put her in Intelligence too, and she was dealing with the Russians in Berlin.</span> <span id="s3491">We visited her, we went to east Berlin.</span> <span id="s3492">She went in uniform, because the Russians had an agreement, they don’t touch Americans.</span> <span id="s3493">The east Germans wanted to, but they were not allowed to touch us, it was a very interesting experience.</span> <span id="s3494">But anyway, Nina became a captain, then met her husband at the advanced Intelligence school in -- and she married a guy who was Catholic, but he agreed that the children were now Jewish.</span> <span id="s3495">So she got out of the army, he’s now a lieutenant colonel, he was -- his last job was -- he was military attaché -- defense attaché in Belarus, which is white Russia, or the city of Minsk, where a lot of Jews lived, and still live.</span> <span id="s3496">They have three synagogues there, and my daughter used to go with her husband to the Dubabitchka synagogue in Minsk.</span> <span id="s3497">And he finished his tour last year.</span> <span id="s3498">They live here in Anendale, and she still brings her children up the Jewish way.</span> <span id="s3499">She has one boy and two girls.</span> <span id="s3500">And she educates them a very nice way, play the violin, play the piano, and so on.</span> <span id="s3501">And her husband has been offered now, the next assignment as a military attaché to Czechoslovakia, to Prague.</span> <span id="s3502">And I said, “Take it, take it.</span> <span id="s3503">That’s a nice place to go to, Prague.”</span> <span id="s3504">We -- my wife and I have been there one time.</span> <span id="s3505">And so Nina is very successful in many ways, particularly bringing up her children the proper way.</span> <span id="s3506">And she did the right thing to leave the army.</span> <span id="s3507">She was a good soldier, she’s a good mother, particularly sh-she studies ecology, which [indecipherable] in the army, no, she was near the mother.</span> <span id="s3508">So, we come to the third child, Marcel, who is money-wise, the most successful of all.</span> <span id="s3509">He worked for a congressman, for our congressman as an intern.</span> <span id="s3510">Well, first of all he went and he -- he got an appointment to the Air Force Academy.</span> <span id="s3511">After two years, his eyes were turning bad, he wanted to become an engineer, and a jet pilot.</span> <span id="s3512">But in this -- when he almost finished his second year, he was told by the air force that he’s not going to fly, because eyes were getting bad from reading too much, but he was going to become an engineer, besides being a pilot.</span> <span id="s3513">And he said, “Well, what I g -- what am I going to do, I’m not going to fly?”</span> <span id="s3514">“Well, you go to missile silo when you graduate.”</span> <span id="s3515">He said no.</span> <span id="s3516">I’m not going to missile silo and be stuck two years the underground.</span> <span id="s3517">And he said, “I’m resigning from the academy.”</span> <span id="s3518">Which he did.</span> <span id="s3519">And I had told him, “Well, you’re on your own.</span> <span id="s3520">You had a [indecipherable], you had to stay four years afterwards, so five years.</span> <span id="s3521">And you going to go do something else, but you’re putting me in a -- in a bind with money, whi -- I was hoping you would get -- I wouldn’t have to pay a penny for you at the academy, but you quit.”</span> <span id="s3522">He said, “Don’t worry, Pop, don’t worry.”</span> <span id="s3523">He went to the Virginia Polytechnic in He was good at math, and he got a -- first of all he got his two years credit from the academy, because h -- if you leave after two years, you have a commitment, and he left when he had two years, just in time.</span> <span id="s3524">So he didn’t have to pay anything back, and he got his degree in Applied Mathematics.</span> <span id="s3525">Short story that when he came out, he worked for the congressman, like I said, and then he applied -- and -- and -- at the high school that his -- his high school as substitute math teacher.</span> <span id="s3526">Well, then he became -- he was also winner in north -- northern Virginia wrestling matches, that’s why the academy was also interested in him, besides other things.</span> <span id="s3527">Well, then he want his first job, he wasn’t make any money with the congressman, that was free for the congressman.</span> <span id="s3528">But he was getting half a day at the school, he was getting paid for that.</span> <span id="s3529">He said, “I gotta make more money.”</span> <span id="s3530">So, he applied for a first job, and he gives a reference the congressman, one of the Beltway bandits, if you know what that -- people getting contracts from the government.</span> <span id="s3531">And the person interviewed him said, “Do you have any references?”</span> <span id="s3532">Well, the school, and the congressman.</span> <span id="s3533">Well he called both of them, and the congressman took the phone himself, and he said, “In my 10 years as a congressman, I never had a better intern.”</span></p> <p><span id="s3534">Q: Which congressman was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s3535">A: That was --</span></p> <p><span id="s3536">Q: It was Wolfe?</span></p> <p><span id="s3537">A: Wolfe.</span> <span id="s3538">Congressman Wolfe.</span> <span id="s3539">And so upon Wolfe giving him a nice reference, he was hired by BDM corporation.</span> <span id="s3540">And he moved up very quickly, and since then, again to make a long story short, in order to get ahead you have to change companies sometimes.</span> <span id="s3541">He went to work for Merck, big pharmacirculated company.</span> <span id="s3542">And so Merck, he was a director at Merck, and he moved about -- well, he moved from Merck to Brussels for two years.</span> <span id="s3543">He was the European representative for Merck, and he got a big computer system started over there.</span> <span id="s3544">And his -- he made a name for himself.</span> <span id="s3545">He is now listed -- I don’t know -- even know what this guys name is, big -- the biggest guy in computers, who in the news all the time, young guy who made millions and mill -- he is listed as the guest speaker with him, on something that’s coming up.</span> <span id="s3546">But again, he’s changed from Merck.</span> <span id="s3547">He was recruited by Squibb -- by what’s that firm, has three names?</span> <span id="s3548">Another pharmaceutical company who is in Princeton, New Jersey, and it has the name of a British city.</span> <span id="s3549">Anyway, it doesn’t make any difference.</span> <span id="s3550">He also is going out with a young lady that is very nice, spoke fluent French, which I love, and was good.</span> <span id="s3551">He went out with her for nine years.</span> <span id="s3552">She wanted to marry him, he also wanted to get married, but he said, “I don’t get married til I make at least a salary of 100,000 a year.”</span> <span id="s3553">Well, when he made it, he got married to her.</span> <span id="s3554">But since then he moved up, and he became the executive director of Bristol, Meyer, Squibb, which also a very big fa -- he -- he’s a wonderful son, not because he makes a lot of money, he is.</span> <span id="s3555">And I could s-say many things, [indecipherable] two boys, wonderful wife, who came here yesterday while her husband’s flying to Brussels.</span> <span id="s3556">So that’s him.</span> <span id="s3557">They live in Princeton, New Jersey.</span> <span id="s3558">After Marcel comes Marguerite, and she’s 36, and Marguerite just got her second degree, [indecipherable] also a Master’s in ec-economics and marketing.</span> <span id="s3559">And she just got married, and she’s the first one that got married to a Jewish guy, who doesn’t care a bit about being Jewish, and she is more Jewish than he is.</span> <span id="s3560">His parents were here, they’re very Jewish, from New York, and he’s a great guy.</span> <span id="s3561">They all married -- they have all great partner, every one of them.</span> <span id="s3562">And their -- their philosophy, or their desire is, if he doesn’t fit in the family, I’m not going to marry him, or her.</span> <span id="s3563">And they all fit in.</span> <span id="s3564">We have the best all of six -- one is not married, the last one, of course.</span> <span id="s3565">They all -- we all get along, just not the in-laws, and they get along with us, and they get along with each other.</span> <span id="s3566">And they all kind -- we have three of them living nearby, they wanted to be sh -- be sure they take care of their parents, some of them, so one of them lives in Princeton, Marcel, and Albert at West Point, and the rest of them live around here.</span></p> <p><span id="s3567">Q: Is Marguerite working?</span></p> <p><span id="s3568">A: Marguerite is working, and don’t tell me what company, I -- I can never.</span> <span id="s3569">She’s working for a big firm that is taking contracts, and that re-organizes people personnel-wise, and marketing, depending on the market.</span> <span id="s3570">And she’s what you might call a -- a woman that takes care of problems for the company.</span> <span id="s3571">She’s a very strong woman, and then we come to the next one, shall I finish the children?</span></p> <p><span id="s3572">Q: Yeah, just a moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s3573">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s3574">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Eddie Willner.</span> <span id="s3575">This is tape number two, side B, and you were describing your children, and we’re now up to number five.</span></p> <p><span id="s3576">A: Okay, I will pick up some of the in-laws that I -- I don’t mention much about them, about who they are.</span> <span id="s3577">Albert’s wife -- her father was a naval officer on an aircraft carrier, he was also a pilot.</span> <span id="s3578">He’s a very nice guy, he is also retired, and lives in Alabama.</span> <span id="s3579">Nicole’s husband I mentioned, is also military, is also lieutenant colonel, recently in Belarus as a military attaché.</span> <span id="s3580">Great guy.</span> <span id="s3581">And he and Albert are probably the -- the two [indecipherable] that are close together of all the kids because they in the military.</span> <span id="s3582">Marcel’s wife speaks fluent French, was working for a big advertising -- not advertising firm, people who deal with money, and making up taxes for a big firm [indecipherable], I forgot the name.</span> <span id="s3583">She does not work, she takes care of the two boys.</span> <span id="s3584">Marguerite, I said, was just married to a Jewish guy, who is also in finance.</span> <span id="s3585">They don’t have no children, they live 10 minutes from here.</span> <span id="s3586">Now we come to Satcheco.</span> <span id="s3587">Satcheco, of course, was born in Japan.</span> <span id="s3588">She is my daughter, and my wife’s daughter, but we gave her a ja -- a -- a Japanese name, because we liked living in Japan.</span> <span id="s3589">She’s 33 now.</span> <span id="s3590">She has an unusual job.</span> <span id="s3591">She is a adjudicator with the Virginia employment office, but actually she deals in unemployment, that’s her specialty.</span> <span id="s3592">She is in charge of a group who handles cases that have been rej -- routinely rejected.</span> <span id="s3593">And she gets a second opinion on it, and a decision whether people should get unemployment or not, depending on whether they quit their job, or they were fired, or [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s3594">So the n-name of adjudicator is not the real name, that is the professional name.</span> <span id="s3595">She’s also -- she called a -- I forgot what it -- it’s like an administrative judge, I -- I -- I can’t think of the name right now.</span> <span id="s3596">Satcheco has the Japanese name, is named after a friend of ours.</span> <span id="s3597">I mentioned the general and his daughter, who come -- who -- who had a daughter who still comes to see us here once a year.</span> <span id="s3598">And she likes her name.</span> <span id="s3599">She doesn’t look Japanese, which surprises everybody when she goes -- they always look for Japanese [indecipherable] call her name.</span> <span id="s3600">She’s 33, and she married a guy and he’s of Chinese descent.</span> <span id="s3601">He is a engineer, working for the U.S. patent office.</span> <span id="s3602">And he is only Chinese in looks, a typical American boy.</span> <span id="s3603">His father’s already born here, he’s a [indecipherable] engineer.</span> <span id="s3604">His mother was born in China, came here as a young girl.</span> <span id="s3605">And she had a li -- a very big marriage, of all Chinese people, about 250 of them, less -- a ye -- about a year ago, and she’s now pregnant.</span> <span id="s3606">And she keeps on working, and her husband, like I said, works for the patent bureau, and he does everything we want.</span> <span id="s3607">He is not religious in any way, but he’ll go to synagogue if you want him to, but he does not -- [indecipherable] synagogue.</span> <span id="s3608">But they both think cooked Chinese food is very good.</span> <span id="s3609">I think that’s how they got together.</span> <span id="s3610">But she’s pregnant now, so she has to watch herself.</span> <span id="s3611">And he is a great guy, as an in -- son in -- we -- we don’t call them son-in-laws, we just call them -- they call me Pop, and I -- I call them by their name.</span> <span id="s3612">So his name is Darren, and the last one is Michael, the youngest one, who is really outstanding in a different way.</span> <span id="s3613">He’s a big -- a real scholar.</span> <span id="s3614">He went to UVA, and College of William and Mary for one year.</span> <span id="s3615">He also had a military scholarship, but he didn’t take advantage of it.</span> <span id="s3616">It -- the military were not for him, and that was okay.</span> <span id="s3617">So he got himself a degree in foreign affairs.</span> <span id="s3618">He is now working on the Master’s at the Georgetown University Foreign Service School, and he will graduate as a diplomat, I guess, up there.</span> <span id="s3619">And he -- in the meantime, he was awarded by the Department of Defense -- he worked this summer, he borrowed all the money to go to Georgetown, because I wasn’t willing to pay for Georgetown, he’s 30 years old, he can do some work in the meantime, which he did.</span> <span id="s3620">He got himself employed by Department of Defense, in the Pentagon, in the Joint Staff, as an analyst for National Security Affairs.</span> <span id="s3621">And he was picked, he didn’t know it when he started that two people get picked in the Pentagon, but he had to go to a new school.</span> <span id="s3622">They gave out regular degree, and Master’s degrees in National Security.</span> <span id="s3623">And there was an article in the paper, he told me down there, I didn’t read it, Washington Post, about this new university, or -- if it’s called university, I don’t have the name right now, but it’s in -- and the school gives out is -- is -- is qualified on the national whatever, to graduate people Master’s degrees in national security affairs.</span> <span id="s3624">[indecipherable] just started a school where you finish in one year, get his Master’s.</span> <span id="s3625">In meantime he gets 35,000 dollars, in addition, for his living expenses.</span> <span id="s3626">But he lives here, but he will move out with a good friend of his into an apartment in December.</span> <span id="s3627">So he doesn’t have to pay anything here, food is free, the good food of his mother, which he will miss, and he lives in the basement, that’s his territory.</span> <span id="s3628">I never know he’s here, not here, and I don’t have to pay a penny for his upkeep, or for -- he takes care of all this himself.</span> <span id="s3629">He’s terrific son, he’s our baby, a mother’s baby.</span> <span id="s3630">So that’s the children, I don’t think I left anybody out.</span></p> <p><span id="s3631">Q: Well, that’s a wonderful family, that’s a wonderful family.</span> <span id="s3632">Let me just ask you before we close, on a previous comment you made in an interview.</span> <span id="s3633">You said that you were German, that was in response to some incident.</span> <span id="s3634">Do you still feel German after all these years?</span> <span id="s3635">Would you describe yourself that way?</span></p> <p><span id="s3636">A: It’s a good question.</span> <span id="s3637">I have to make a distinction, if somebody says, “Are you German or Jewish?”</span> <span id="s3638">Some people come with the question.</span> <span id="s3639">Well, I’m German.</span> <span id="s3640">That’s my nationality, or was, was.</span> <span id="s3641">Jewish is my religion.</span> <span id="s3642">There’s a big difference.</span> <span id="s3643">Do I feel German, Jewish?</span> <span id="s3644">I would say both.</span> <span id="s3645">Because there’s some traits in my character that’s definitely German, not Jewish.</span> <span id="s3646">And there’s some of them may be Jewish.</span> <span id="s3647">Now, I think I have the advantage of taking the best of all three of these things, German, [indecipherable] take poetry, or some, and there was a German poem that kept me alive in the camps in the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s3648">Q: Can you s -- can you say it now?</span></p> <p><span id="s3649">A: [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s3650">Well, I can say it in German, but I will give it to you, it’s in my wallet in English.</span> <span id="s3651">Or my wife can send it to you, make a copy of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3652">Q: Can you say it in German now?</span></p> <p><span id="s3653">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3654">Q: Why don’t you do it?</span></p> <p><span id="s3655">A: Unga vontzen trotsashaldin.</span> <span id="s3656">Mira deshpoink kraftisi sang, houfidi amadai gotaiba.</span> <span id="s3657">It’s from Gerta.</span> <span id="s3658">So that’s definitely German.</span> <span id="s3659">It means something basically -- the translation’s very ba -- not -- you cannot translate -- it’s you are countin -- all power -- all bad powers that be.</span> <span id="s3660">You never give up, you show yourselves in strength, not down being, and well, which also, I like to add something which I used in the army in a different way.</span> <span id="s3661">When you are a commander, or in charge of men who go into combat, you don’t want to show that you are scared.</span> <span id="s3662">But everybody is scared.</span> <span id="s3663">That doesn’t make you an officer, or not an officer.</span> <span id="s3664">They’re all scared the first time, or second or third time.</span> <span id="s3665">There’s no such thing, you heard, as an atheist in a foxhole.</span> <span id="s3666">Well, I -- I -- I -- my motto was, keep your fears to yourself, and share your courage with others.</span> <span id="s3667">And that’s why I teamed up with this Dutchman in concentration camp.</span> <span id="s3668">Sure we were scared, but we didn’t show it to each other, and that’s why I succeeded eventually, with lack of co -- now let me see about the other part.</span> <span id="s3669">And in -- in spite of all this, you are staying alive, you’re keeping yourself alive, by all means.</span> <span id="s3670">And this German poem was -- really had a large responsibility in keeping me alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s3671">Q: Did you know it as a child before the war started?</span></p> <p><span id="s3672">A: Yes, I knew it before I went in the camps.</span> <span id="s3673">And actually, it’s a lot li --</span></p> <p><span id="s3674">Q: W-When did you learn it?</span></p> <p><span id="s3675">A: It’s a la -- probably in fourth, fifth grade.</span> <span id="s3676">Very early.</span> <span id="s3677">It’s a very serious poem, [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3678">Q: Was this a poem that all the children --</span></p> <p><span id="s3679">A: -- just took that part that -- that applied to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s3680">Q: Was this a poem that all children had to learn in school?</span></p> <p><span id="s3681">A: All children in Germany, yes.</span> <span id="s3682">And then later on, I changed to a Jewish school, because Jews couldn’t go any more.</span> <span id="s3683">I had a Jewish teacher, and he was more German than the Germans.</span> <span id="s3684">And I -- he was so strict, my father was very strict, that when I found him living in the United States, in New York, after the war, he had not escaped to New York with his wife, no children, but he had been hidden by two German f-families who were both schoolteachers like he was, and hidden throughout the war.</span> <span id="s3685">It would have cost them their lives if they were found out.</span> <span id="s3686">That was my teacher, my strictest teacher, a guy I probably hated at the time, who hit me a million times, and then I got it when I came home, from my father, I got double dosage.</span> <span id="s3687">So when I finally found him, he was 75, or 80 years old in New York, I went -- I called him up first.</span> <span id="s3688">I found out coincidentally, in a German Jewish newspaper which I read, and in a announcement of somebody die -- oh yeah, the people went Shanghai, I mentioned to you before, the girl that was in my class.</span> <span id="s3689">She said, “You know, our old teacher lives in New York?”</span> <span id="s3690">I said, “No, I didn’t.”</span> <span id="s3691">“Mr. Damon lives in New York, he came after the war.”</span> <span id="s3692">I said, “You got his number?</span> <span id="s3693">I want to call him.”</span> <span id="s3694">I called him up same evening, and Mr. Damon said, “Oh yeah, Willner, Willner, I remember you.”</span> <span id="s3695">And I said, bull, he can’t remember, he had thousands of kids.</span> <span id="s3696">And he doesn’t remember me.</span> <span id="s3697">Maybe he remembers me for some of the bad things I did.</span> <span id="s3698">So he said -- I said to him for a joke, “Well, Mr. Damon, I remember you, too, very well.</span> <span id="s3699">As a matter of fact, my rear still hurts.”</span> <span id="s3700">And soon after my wife and I went to New York, we went to see him, and he -- we couldn’t have done a greater pleasure to this guy.</span> <span id="s3701">And he was supposed to go with us to Germany, to receive some honors, in the city where we were invited for two weeks.</span> <span id="s3702">He couldn’t go be -- his heart -- his heart was not strong enough.</span> <span id="s3703">He has died since.</span></p> <p><span id="s3704">Q: You had s-said that your --</span></p> <p><span id="s3705">A: Oh yeah, before he died, I wanted him to write a letter to address the German people inviting us, and say whatever he wanted to say to the Germans.</span> <span id="s3706">Well, he was very nice about it, he didn’t insult anybody.</span> <span id="s3707">And he -- I read the letter to a group of about 500 Germans [indecipherable], and maybe 100 Jews, who came back from different -- from Brazil, from Israel, or -- and I could -- I became so emotional during the -- reading his -- his letter that one German came up to me, a newspaper guy, he said, “Would you read it in front of German TV station?”</span> <span id="s3708">I -- I said I would.</span> <span id="s3709">That was the greatest thing, I read it for my schoolteacher, because he bared himself, and he took them to task, but in a nice way.</span> <span id="s3710">And he also didn’t suffer, he was hidden, he could say something good, and not just bad about the Germans.</span> <span id="s3711">The two teachers hid him, and their wives, were not caught, and then sor -- the part that you asked me about Germany, that’s good and bad.</span> <span id="s3712">And [indecipherable] able -- I -- I tell you s -- one thing, far as that is concerned, hate, or what do you call it, when somebody -- guilt -- oh, collective guilt.</span> <span id="s3713">I don’t believe in collective guilt, never have.</span> <span id="s3714">I don’t think that all Germans are guilty.</span> <span id="s3715">There are many Germans that are guilty, who knew about it, who didn’t lift a finger.</span> <span id="s3716">I’m not talking about the SS now, the real bad guys.</span> <span id="s3717">So -- as a matter of fact, I would not be alive today if it wouldn’t be some German, who was somehow -- gave me a piece of bread, extra piece of bread, or [indecipherable] something.</span> <span id="s3718">So, I said to my wife after the army, what are we going to do by going in a civil service job.</span> <span id="s3719">Well, there were many jobs open in Germany that time, for Americans, and civilian.</span> <span id="s3720">I said, “I go back and get a job.”</span> <span id="s3721">“You would?”</span> <span id="s3722">Johanna said, “I won’t.</span> <span id="s3723">I’m finished with Germany.”</span> <span id="s3724">So I changed my mind since, I th -- I think my wife was right.</span> <span id="s3725">So that part of Germany, so you ha -- you have some good, and some bad, and some people -- I think if you hate people, all people like t -- you believe they’re all guilty, it eats you up eventually, not the other person, the other person didn’t -- probably don’t give a damn.</span> <span id="s3726">And people are sensitive.</span> <span id="s3727">I -- I never -- I don’t love the SS or somebody like that, I don’t say that, but that some people were good Germans.</span> <span id="s3728">So there’s good Jews, and bad Jews.</span> <span id="s3729">Maybe there were more Nazis then.</span> <span id="s3730">But I believe today -- for instance, what goes on in Israel [indecipherable] watch TV, I -- I think the Jews have a point.</span> <span id="s3731">The Arabs who cannot deny them certain things.</span> <span id="s3732">Unfortunately it’s a situation that is very difficult to solve, if at all.</span> <span id="s3733">I -- I must -- I made a speech, and I haven’t made many speeches here, about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s3734">One was at the high school that our children went to, and the principal was of German descent, not Jewish.</span> <span id="s3735">He invited me, and he said -- and I couldn’t turn him down.</span> <span id="s3736">And he -- he not -- not -- he didn’t take the ger -- the history class, at that time [indecipherable] World War two, is -- he took 700 kids into the auditorium, and he said, “I want you to listen to Mr. Willner, Albert’s father.”</span> <span id="s3737">They listened to me, and at the end of my talk -- so I talk about some of the experiences World War two -- at the end of the talk one boy stood up, had a question, and he said to me, “Mr. Willner, you think it could happen here?”</span> <span id="s3738">I said, “It’s a very good question,” I said, “yes, it could.</span> <span id="s3739">But we have a democratic government.</span> <span id="s3740">But Germany had a democratic government too, when Hitler came to power.</span> <span id="s3741">It can be turned around like you never know what’s going to happen.</span> <span id="s3742">I don’t think it’s going to happen here, not in my lifetime, I hope, but these people, bad people exist here, too.</span> <span id="s3743">Who hate, who don’t like Jews, don’t like Blacks, or whatever.</span> <span id="s3744">And the same people that I saw in SS uniforms in Germany, I have seen them, I’m sorry to say, in our own army.</span> <span id="s3745">Just put an SS uniform.</span> <span id="s3746">People who would kill Vietnamese women and children, think nothing of it.</span> <span id="s3747">Gooks, they were gooks to them.”</span> <span id="s3748">And people were shocked, particularly the principal, he took me to his office later on, I won’t -- he was shocked because he felt, as a German -- he was born here, his father was German, he said.</span> <span id="s3749">And I told him, “Dr. Toombs, this is ridiculous that you even think that way.</span> <span id="s3750">What responsibility could you have had in what the Germans did because your father is German himself?</span> <span id="s3751">There’s no such thing as collective guilt, not in my book.”</span> <span id="s3752">Well, we really became very good friends, of course, we were already.</span> <span id="s3753">And so these -- and I must add that the same people, some people like that, exist even among the Jews in Israel, who would go kill Arabs just because they’re Arabs.</span> <span id="s3754">I’m sorry to say, but it -- that’s the way I feel.</span> <span id="s3755">So these bad people exist in any country, given a chance to do it.</span> <span id="s3756">I have seen my own army, Lieutenant Calley, who -- who killed women and children in his [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s3757">He should not be in -- jailed, his superior should have been jailed.</span> <span id="s3758">Why?</span> <span id="s3759">Because they knew he was a killer, and what he was eventually going to do.</span> <span id="s3760">They should have made him -- his commanding officer should have made a supply officer in the back, where he can’t do any harm, shoot women and children.</span> <span id="s3761">So these people existed.</span> <span id="s3762">And here, in peace time, the types exist and if they do something bad, they wind up in the penitentiary.</span> <span id="s3763">In war time they get away with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3764">Q: Do you think the current interest in the Holocaust with the museums, and so forth --</span></p> <p><span id="s3765">A: The current interest [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3766">Q: The current interest in the Holocaust, and people coming to museums and so forth, is something that will be permanent, or is it a passing interest?</span></p> <p><span id="s3767">A: That’s difficult to say.</span> <span id="s3768">Depending how much we -- we -- we have to put a lot -- we Jews have to put a lot into it.</span> <span id="s3769">And other people who are not Jews, who think likewise, that if you don’t protect certain things, or that people go [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s3770">Like yesterday I was discussing the NRA.</span> <span id="s3771">I got an application to apply for NRA, for the membership.</span> <span id="s3772">And I talked to my wife about it, and I said, “Throw it away.”</span> <span id="s3773">And she happened to listen to an NRA interview of this guy who is in charge, LaPierre.</span> <span id="s3774">I wasn’t here.</span> <span id="s3775">And she told me about it.</span> <span id="s3776">Well, as long as we have people like that, we have to be active doing something about it.</span> <span id="s3777">And we have to keep going.</span> <span id="s3778">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3779">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s3780">So you feel it’s important to have museums dedicated to the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s3781">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3782">I think it’s important.</span> <span id="s3783">But it’s not important maybe in some little town where nobody takes a look at pe -- it’s the passing thing.</span> <span id="s3784">And recently the name came up, Holocaust industry.</span> <span id="s3785">I got a letter now they -- they -- th-they -- they -- they are -- they are elevating a wall in Paris, just like the Vietnam Wall here, with all the names on it.</span> <span id="s3786">They want my parents name on it, they want me to contribute money.</span> <span id="s3787">I will not contribute any money, my parents don’t have a grave, that’s true, but I’d rather give the money I have to give away to living causes, where it’s -- well, I can tell you, I feel very strong recently about certain incidents that had happened.</span> <span id="s3788">And then I can think [indecipherable], which upset me very much.</span> <span id="s3789">I was a contributor like most of -- most Jews, to the Jewish appeal.</span> <span id="s3790">They now write this letter that a Russian Jew, who came to Israel with his father, was drafted, became a sergeant in the army, was killed in Lebanon or someplace, and they couldn’t bury the guy, because his mother was not Jewish.</span> <span id="s3791">That’s the Orthodox.</span> <span id="s3792">No, I could not live in Israel with people like that.</span> <span id="s3793">I tell you very frankly, they make me sick sometimes.</span> <span id="s3794">Some of them don’t fight for their country, let some other people fight for their country.</span> <span id="s3795">And when this happened to this guy who killed -- was killed for Israel, and they couldn’t bury him because the Orthodox wouldn’t let them do it, and he had to be shipped back to Russia, to his mother.</span> <span id="s3796">I thought [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s3797">At that moment I wrote a letter to the United Jewish Appeal, I’m sorry I don’t have it right now, I don’t even know where I put it.</span> <span id="s3798">And th-the president or executive director answered it personally.</span> <span id="s3799">I said, “I will not contribute any money because I know some of your money go -- go to Orthodox Jews, I don’t support Orthodox Jews.”</span> <span id="s3800">And he wrote me a nice letter.</span> <span id="s3801">I said, “I’d rather give the money to the Holocaust Museum, and not -- not the United Jewish Appeal, where I know some of the people, recipients, and just to run their schools, or whatever.”</span> <span id="s3802">Let them do it themselves, I -- I don’t approve of it.</span> <span id="s3803">When they can’t let a guy be buried in the cemetery, even if he was buried in the corner, but they just said no for some reason.</span> <span id="s3804">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3805">Q: Is there any message you wanted to give to your grandchildren when they’re a little older.</span> <span id="s3806">Do you have anything to say because of your experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s3807">A: Well, I’m sure my grinch -- grandchildren will be instructed by their parents.</span> <span id="s3808">And they’re -- they have available all my tapes, and my -- no, at this stage I would say no, they’re too small.</span></p> <p><span id="s3809">Q: No, I don’t mean now, but is there a message to them when they’re older, that you would want to leave for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s3810">A: They can see what I have to say, what their grandfather had to say on all the tapes and videos, and they’re a little bit different, but I think it drives home some of the things we’re interested in, in seeing continuing.</span> <span id="s3811">So -- oh, they get -- they will also get some things in writing, and they have written poems.</span> <span id="s3812">If you go to the next room -- I don’t know if I can [indecipherable], I’d like to just read you one poem that my oldest son wrote when he was 11 or 12 years old.</span> <span id="s3813">You wouldn’t believe it, and that’s how the grandchildren will think, too, I hope.</span></p> <p><span id="s3814">Q: Would you like to read it?</span> <span id="s3815">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3816">A: I’ll let you read it, if I can get up [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s3817">Q: You said there was a poem that your son Albert had written that you’d like to read.</span></p> <p><span id="s3818">A: Albert wrote this when he was 12 years old.</span> <span id="s3819">“They were invited to death, and didn’t know it.</span> <span id="s3820">The Nazis told them that there was a shower.</span> <span id="s3821">Well, in a way it was.</span> <span id="s3822">A shower of death.</span> <span id="s3823">They were put in there, death started to rain about them.</span> <span id="s3824">Cries, shouts, screams, prayers, and then death rested on their souls.”</span> <span id="s3825">He was 12 years old when he wrote that.</span> <span id="s3826">And that’s very deep.</span> <span id="s3827">And we have a few others that some of the other kids wrote, but this, it was the one impressed me the most.</span> <span id="s3828">And this is the kind of education he got mostly through my wife, poetry.</span> <span id="s3829">She likes to write, she’s writing a book, too.</span> <span id="s3830">And she wrote lot of poetry.</span> <span id="s3831">She has stuff accept by Hadassah, the Jewish newspaper, printed.</span> <span id="s3832">And she had several other things.</span> <span id="s3833">So, she must take credit for that.</span> <span id="s3834">Not for writing this, for putting this kind of spirit into him.</span> <span id="s3835">And when you ask about the grandchildren, I’m sure his children will continue to feel like he does.</span> <span id="s3836">He’s very quiet about it, but he speaks out when he should.</span> <span id="s3837">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s3838">Q: Is there anything you wanted to add for the tape, for the interview that we haven’t talked about?</span> <span id="s3839">Anything you wanted to say before we close?</span></p> <p><span id="s3840">A: [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s3841">I have not forgotten anything, but I would say that in general, we don’t disagree on any of the things I said, the children and I, because they have seen all the videotapes that have been made, the things that I’ve said.</span> <span id="s3842">And in talking to them, I’ve confirmed, or reinforced some of the things I’ve said.</span> <span id="s3843">And the grandchildren I cannot say.</span> <span id="s3844">I really cannot, to be honest.</span> <span id="s3845">Some of them frankly will not grow up as Jews, but it doesn’t bother me, as long as they have in their heart, and they know something about their past, that I don’t want the daughter to say, “Well, my husband is Catholic,” -- and in a matter of fact -- well, that’s another story.</span> <span id="s3846">I’m not going to -- she teach them how to be Jewish, and she can do it.</span> <span id="s3847">She takes it serious, so does Maggie.</span> <span id="s3848">So the -- out of the girls be -- the mothers being the ones that’s really educate the children, because they’re home, or because the Jewish religion, the Orthodox say so, that’s fine with me.</span> <span id="s3849">But I would say definitely two [indecipherable] know right now, Marguerite and Nicole are educating their children -- Marguerite doesn’t have any children yet, but she was going the way Nicole goes, and her children, particularly the two daughters, getting a good Jewish education.</span> <span id="s3850">They belong to a synagogue here.</span> <span id="s3851">They don’t go much to synagogue, but they go to the re-religious education.</span> <span id="s3852">And they did the same thing in Minsk.</span></p> <p><span id="s3853">Q: Do you think that the world has learned the lessons of the Holocaust, or will it ever?</span></p> <p><span id="s3854">A: No, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s3855">They -- they aware of it, but why -- why would the Blacks in Africa care about all [indecipherable] their own.</span> <span id="s3856">Why the many Chinese have been killed in some of the wars, millions.</span> <span id="s3857">And they -- they don’t think that the way we do, that Jews were killed only because they were Jews, and there were different reasons.</span> <span id="s3858">For the moment, that’s all still in people’s mind, people are still alive, they experience it, but I think another two generation, it will peter out somehow.</span> <span id="s3859">It -- because they have the [indecipherable] with television now, I -- I will say one thing, or my wife at least thinks so, that if we had a television, it wouldn’t have happened.</span> <span id="s3860">Not in -- in that -- that way.</span> <span id="s3861">So I think television will do a lot in the future to prevent things.</span> <span id="s3862">Well, I-I -- I-I -- I’m very si-sim-simplisistic [indecipherable] as far as that goes.</span> <span id="s3863">I think the United States, I always felt, we don’t have ma -- many problems as Jews, but other people have, the Blacks.</span> <span id="s3864">So in a way, if they didn’t have any problems with the Blacks, they probably would have somebody else [indecipherable] would be more.</span> <span id="s3865">Might be Jews, it might be an Asian, Korean, Japan -- whoever.</span> <span id="s3866">Or Blacks from Africa.</span> <span id="s3867">But I don’t think we have too much to worry about here, not in our lifetime.</span></p> <p><span id="s3868">Q: Well, that’s a nice note to end it on.</span></p> <p><span id="s3869">A: I hope -- I hope -- I hope it’s the -- it’s the right thing I believe, but who knows, you never know, but I na -- I think dictatorships hopefully on the way out, we just happened to have another one go in Yugoslavia, and I hope it continues and we can make the world better by example, by keeping the Holocaust story alive.</span> <span id="s3870">I think it’s very important, but how much do you keep alive in 50 years from now, I -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s3871">Because there other concerns in the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s3872">Q: Well thank you very much for doing the interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s3873">A: You’re welcome.</span> <span id="s3874">It was a pleasure.</span></p> <p><span id="s3875">Q: This concludes the interview of Eddie Willner.</span></p> <p><span id="s3876">End of Tape
