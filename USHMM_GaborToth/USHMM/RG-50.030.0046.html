CONVERSATION] 01:00:06</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: Okay, The camera's on.</span> <span id="s16">Would you tell me your name please?</span> <span id="s17">A: Thomas Buergenthal.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: And where and when were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: I was born in Lubochnia, Czechoslovakia, in 1934.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: Would you tell me something about your parents, please?</span> <span id="s21">Where did they come from?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: My mother came – well, my – actually, my – both of my parents came to Czechoslovakia from Germany.</span> <span id="s23">They got, came there when Hitler came to power; and I was born there shortly after they got to Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: Tell me about growing up.</span> <span id="s25">Did you grow up there?</span> <span id="s26">And your very early years, before the Nazis came.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: What little I remember, really, in that period: I grew up in Czechoslovakia, in that town, very uneventfully; a small resort town.</span> <span id="s28">From what I remember, what little I remember, a very pleasant environment.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: You moved at one point.</span> <span id="s30">Where did you move to, again, before the Nazis?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: Well, we moved from Lubochnia to a town in Slovakia called Zilina(ph).</span> <span id="s32">The—my, my father had bought a hotel in, in this town in Czechoslovakia, in Lubochnia.</span> <span id="s33">It was a hotel that was designed to be for German political refugees awaiting the fall of Hitler.</span> <span id="s34">My father thought that Hitler would not last more than four years, and he wanted to be nearby and have his friends there.</span> <span id="s35">Well, by, by 1938, very few people could come out of Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s36">So the hotel wasn't going very well.</span> <span id="s37">And at that point, we left the hotel and moved to Zilina(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s39">What happened there, when by 1938, '39?</span> <span id="s40">Did things change?</span> <span id="s41">01:02:14</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: Well, the – in Slovakia, the Hlinka, Hlinka Guard, which was a fascist group aligned with the Nazis, began harassing Jews and looking for certain people, and my father was one of the people they apparently had on, on some list.</span> <span id="s43">It became clear to us that if we didn't leave the risk – at least, the risk to my parents – that the risk was very great.</span> <span id="s44">And that at some point, shortly before the German invasion, we tried to cross the border into Poland.</span> <span id="s45">It took about a week to cross the border, in, in no-man's-land between Poland and, and Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s46">The last time when we – in no-man's-land, when we went – were shipped back to Czechoslovakia, then the Germans were already there, in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s47">And it was curious that it was the Germans who actually helped us get into Poland at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: How do you mean, helped you?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: Well, the Germans didn't realize who we were.</span> <span id="s50">And my father told them that he was Polish, and that the Poles wouldn't let us in.</span> <span id="s51">And so they actually carried our suitcases and told the Poles that they had to let us in.</span> <span id="s52">And that's how we entered Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: Okay, Okay.</span> <span id="s54">But you entered Poland.</span> <span id="s55">And where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: Well, we had political refugee status, my father, and we went to Katowice, in southern – in Poland, to await our entry, or the right to leave for England.</span> <span id="s57">My father had papers that would have allowed him to go to England.</span> <span id="s58">We registered in Katowice with the British Consul and waited there until we were supposed to be called up to, to leave for England.</span> <span id="s59">And it was really on the day when the Germans moved into, into Poland, on September first that we were supposed to be leaving for England.</span> <span id="s60">And we actually left.</span> <span id="s61">What happened was that the British Consul – there were quite a number of refugees in our position – were put on a train chartered by the British to take us to the, to the Balkans, and hopefully, from there to England.</span> <span id="s62">But the plane – the train – never got very far; because we were bombed by German planes and had to abandon the train in Poland not, not very far from the Russian border.</span> <span id="s63">And at that point, the question was: “What do what do we do next?”</span> <span id="s64">My, my father actually went and crossed into, into the Soviet Union, across the Bug River; and came back and decided – actually, he had crossed over to see whether we should go to the Soviet Union – crossed over and decided that we weren't going to be much better off there than if we stayed in Poland.</span> <span id="s65">So he came back.</span> <span id="s66">And we then marched with the refugees on the, on the roads and were actually taken over by German tanks on, on the roads near some village in Poland.</span> <span id="s67">After a while, we ended up in a town more or less in central Poland, called Kielce, and eventually ended up in the ghetto of Kielce, and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">01:06:25</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: Tell us – by then, you are five.</span> <span id="s70">Tell us, if you can – A: No.</span> <span id="s71">By then, I'm – yeah, five.</span> <span id="s72">Yes, six.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s74">Tell me what you remember of Kielce.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: Well, Kielce was, was – at least from what I remember initially, or maybe in retrospect – it's often very hard to keep these things apart.</span> <span id="s76">I had never se – Kielce really had a very large Jewish community, and I've since found out that there were more than twenty thousand Jews in Kielce – a long tradition.</span> <span id="s77">There were a lot of very religious Jews.</span> <span id="s78">There were Jewish schools and everything – things I had never seen before in – in Czechoslovakia, where, where we were.</span> <span id="s79">There were – let me see, what else do I remember from the initial period?</span> <span id="s80">There was another language – two languages, in fact: both Yiddish and Polish.</span> <span id="s81">Initially – again, until things, until 1941, '42, things were not all that bad.</span> <span id="s82">It was when the when the ghetto was established, all the Jews were herded into one part of the city.Food became very scarce.</span> <span id="s83">Housing became very scarce.</span> <span id="s84">We lived in, in one room that my father and mother and I shared.</span> <span id="s85">And food was very difficult to come by.</span> <span id="s86">A lot of, lot of hunger, but still not as serious.</span> <span id="s87">There were still a lot of people who lived quite well, who had, had ways of getting food into the, into the ghetto, especially in the beginning.</span> <span id="s88">Things gradually became harder and harder.</span> <span id="s89">And the, the walls were – protection was built up much heavier than initially.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Initially, it was still possible for people to go in and out, I remember.</span> <span id="s91">But after a while that became more difficult.</span> <span id="s92">Then, of course, in 1942, the ghetto.</span> <span id="s93">Most of the people in the ghetto – I would think about some close to 20,000 people – were shipped to Treblinka,and that included my grandparents as well.</span> <span id="s94">That was sort of the first really serious killing experience that, that I had.</span> <span id="s95">During – I should note, though, that in the ghetto itself there were – if not daily, certainly sporadic – killings going on by Germans of people, German guards of Jews on the street.</span> <span id="s96">At the same time, there appeared to be some sort of normalcy that, that reigned, but then in '42, all of that came to an end.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">01:09:37</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: Can you describe the deportation?</span> <span id="s99">What did you see?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: Well, the, the—one morning we were awakened with screaming and shooting outside – orders in German: "Everybody out!"</span> <span id="s101">And whoever wasn't to be out would be would be shot, and apparently a lot of older people, others who couldn't move, were shot.</span> <span id="s102">My father, who was, was a very cool person – that's sort of the, the memory I have – wasn't going to move until he had shaved and had time to think what to do.</span> <span id="s103">And – actually that's what saved us because he took a group, he took us and a group of people out and marched us to – he had been in charge of a shop – and marched us out to the shop, saying that he had orders to protect the shop and keep the, the people in.</span> <span id="s104">And that's – and safeguard a number of people, about twenty people, protecting the shop.</span> <span id="s105">And actually, that's how I was not initially shipped out.</span> <span id="s106">The – we did, however, at the end – when the, when the Nazis finally caught up with us – we were all lined up, as everybody else.</span> <span id="s107">And you had most of the people marching in, in one direction, and maybe a few hundred people being saved.</span> <span id="s108">And we were in that group to 1 The ghetto was established in April 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">2 This event, which constituted the liquidation of the ghetto, took place from August 20 to August 24, 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">end up in another camp, sort of a forced labor camp, also in Kielce.</span> <span id="s111">I'm compressing all of this a great deal.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: It's okay, we have time, we have time.</span> <span id="s113">Can you tell us about the forced labor camp?</span> <span id="s114">01:11:49</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: Well, that was basically – when you, when you think of the ghetto as a substantial section of town, the forced labor camp was basically one street that was surrounded with barbed wire and, and other – or maybe two streets.</span> <span id="s116">And most of the people worked – were taken out from there to work in various, various jobs.</span> <span id="s117">I didn't do anything.</span> <span id="s118">I was there with my mother.</span> <span id="s119">And matter of fact, my mother had saved two other children from the—whose, whose parents had – were shipped out in, in '42.</span> <span id="s120">Two children had been left, and she took them in.</span> <span id="s121">So we ended up then in, in one-half room, I think, with, with two other children yet.</span> <span id="s122">And – but life still, put it – given what was to follow, was still more or less livable, but very – under very difficult circumstances.</span> <span id="s123">Here the killing increased.</span> <span id="s124">Every so often, or anybody tried to escape, there would be executions and beatings and other things.</span> <span id="s125">The, the worst thing that happened in that camp was towards the end, when the – when – I think it was in, in '43, or the beginning of '44 – and I'm – my dates are wrong – when there was another Selektion Basically, you know, when people were shipped off to be killed.</span> <span id="s126">What happened there was that all the – they lined us up on a sort of like a playground, and separated all the children, and that became the, the famous massacre of the children in Kielce.</span> <span id="s127">I was the only one to survive – at least of the group that was, was visible.</span> <span id="s128">Two other children saved themselves by hiding in the house where the children were taken.</span> <span id="s129">But what happened there was that the, the children who were taken out, ended up – were taken to a cemetery and killed with hand grenades.</span> <span id="s130">The Jewish cemetery in, in Kielce; I, I survived that one.</span> <span id="s131">That was the worst part in that, that episode.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">01:14:28</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: How did you survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: Very curious.</span> <span id="s135">They had us lined up on the field.</span> <span id="s136">The German, the commander of the, of the camp, was standing in the middle making the decision who was going to live and who was going to die, and they pulled tried to pull me out, and my mother and father more or less pulled the other direction.</span> <span id="s137">And finally, they – my mother, my father and I deci – went up to the German commander; and I said, in German, that I – to let me live, because I could work.</span> <span id="s138">And in German.</span> <span id="s139">And I, I think what, what I saw happen in camps a number of times was that they were somehow shocked to find that somebody looked very much like their own children, who spoke the same language the way their own children would speak, was there.</span> <span id="s140">They had – I think they believed a lot of their own propaganda.</span> <span id="s141">And he looked at me and 3 Nazi term for the selection of prisoners for transport.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">said in German, "Well, let's see," and let me go.</span> <span id="s143">The whole thing may have lasted two seconds.</span> <span id="s144">And that's how I stayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: What happened to you after that?</span> <span id="s146">01:15:55</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: Well, after that we ended up in, in a factory, in – still in Kielce.</span> <span id="s148">The surviving people in this group – I think about two hundred – were split up, half taken to one factory, another half to another factory.</span> <span id="s149">My parents and I ended up in a, in a – and, incidentally, the two children who were younger than I that we had then died in that also.</span> <span id="s150">We, we ended up in a factory where they were making carts for – wooden carts – for their Eastern Front.</span> <span id="s151">At that point I had a very interesting job and assignment.</span> <span id="s152">The feeling was that, that to survive there, it was important to have something to do; and, and I wasn't even 10 years old.</span> <span id="s153">So I went to the commander, commander of the German – of that camp; and told him, asked him whether he needed an errand boy.</span> <span id="s154">And he looked at me, and he said, "Fine."</span> <span id="s155">And so basically, my, my job in that, in that camp consisted of sitting outside his door and doing chores that he needed to have done, like getting his bicycle or taking something to one place or another.</span> <span id="s156">The, the job had great advantages because I could hear what was going on and could report back, and I could also alert people to his coming because I would be going ahead of him, running, announcing his coming.</span> <span id="s157">And so we had the signal that I would signal.</span> <span id="s158">He had – he wore a hat with a feather; and if I went like this to people [gesturing], then he was coming.</span> <span id="s159">And – because if people were seen not working, they would be beaten very badly.</span> <span id="s160">One interesting episode in that connection is that I could listen to the radio.</span> <span id="s161">He would listen to the radio, and I would sit outside, and I could hear.</span> <span id="s162">And I heard the, the capture of Mussolini,reported it.</span> <span id="s163">Of course, nobody believed me.</span> <span id="s164">We had no access to radio or any news.</span> <span id="s165">But that was – and the fact that I worked there actually enabled us to have some food, and my father and mother both worked in that factory.</span> <span id="s166">But it was one way of, of surviving, and giving me a cer – certain amount of protection, as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">01:18:49</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: Did things change at some point?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: Well, what changed at, at some point was that in 1944 the decision was made, I guess, to ship everybody in that camp to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s170">And we were, we were shipped to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: Can you describe the transport?</span> <span id="s172">What was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">4 In September 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">5 In early August 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: We were in, in open cars, railroad cars—put in.</span> <span id="s176">Interestingly enough, the Germans—we, we, of course, everybody was worried; and I remember people asking, "Where are we going?"</span> <span id="s177">and so forth.</span> <span id="s178">The Germans told us we were being shipped to Germany.</span> <span id="s179">And we once – one believes what one wants to believe, and I suppose for a while we thought that's where we were going.</span> <span id="s180">Again, I remember my father saying initially that the direction of the train was going to Germany, and then suddenly it, it changed.</span> <span id="s181">And that's when he knew that we were, we were going to someplace else.</span> <span id="s182">And he knew then we were going to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s183">Some people jumped out of the train.</span> <span id="s184">The way those trains were set up, the, the Germans had machine guns at the end of the, the train, and if anybody jumped out, they would just try to kill the people, and I think a number of people jumped out of the train on the way to – and I don't know, know whether they were, were hit or not.</span> <span id="s185">The, the most memorable thing was to arrive in, in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s186">It was, you know, from a child's perspective, it was just like having driven into an insane asylum, with people walking back and forth, doing things.</span> <span id="s187">We, we saw a group carrying bricks from one place to another and carrying them back.</span> <span id="s188">And we, we expected to be met by machine guns, so we had no idea what the, the arrival in Auschwitz – apart from, from this total view of people in these prison – those prison garb carrying, running different ways, with Kaposwith sticks.</span> <span id="s189">Was, was a certain calm.</span> <span id="s190">We arrived.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">01:21:31 We were, we were lined up and told we were going to go to, to a laundry.</span> <span id="s192">Had our hair shaved.</span> <span id="s193">At that point, we expected that things would happen as in Treblinka, where we would be immediately executed.</span> <span id="s194">What happened was that since our camp, since our transfer came from these two factories in Kielce, it was assumed that everybody there was capable of working.</span> <span id="s195">And there was no Selektion.</span> <span id="s196">That's really the way I came into Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s197">I would never have – as a child, would never have gotten in because they would have selected me right out, at my age, at the camp.</span> <span id="s198">But there was no Selektion.</span> <span id="s199">We actually went through the, the sauna – and I mean that they shaved our hair, disinfected us, and eventually, tattooed us; but I don't think right at the, at the arrival and sent us to camp.</span> <span id="s200">And we ended up – this is, of course, Auschwitz-Birkenau – ended up in what used to be the Gypsy camp, and was still known as the Zigeunerlager, the, the "Gypsy camp.</span> <span id="s201">"That's how I got to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">01:22:51</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s204">Describe where you were taken and what you did, what the barrack was like where you lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: Well, the barracks were very much like the barracks you see in pictures that one sees.</span> <span id="s206">These big three story bunks, very broad, with about ten people fitting into them – just wooden, wooden boards, very crowded.</span> <span id="s207">The first night on arrival, that was, was probably one of the</span></p> <p><span id="s208">6 Overseers (German).</span></p> <p><span id="s209">7 Birkenau section B-IIe.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">worst in, in my experience because this was the night when one or two of the people who had been collaborators in our camp and had shipped some people to Auschwitz were beaten very badly.</span> <span id="s211">So this was by people who had – whom they had shipped to the camp, who in the meantime themselves had become Kapos.</span> <span id="s212">The world never changes.</span> <span id="s213">But, that was sort of the first, the first night, that experience.</span> <span id="s214">That's, you know, the, the sort of initial thing I remember of Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s215">We – there were some people that I. – my father knew, who had been shipped out before.</span> <span id="s216">There again, my father and some friends thought that the way for me to survive was to try to find something to do.</span> <span id="s217">And I went – or rather, I don't know who went.</span> <span id="s218">But at any rate, I managed to get to be the errand boy for the Kapo in the, in the laundry and sau – I don't know what they called it.</span> <span id="s219">A place where people... The wash rooms.</span> <span id="s220">And that, again I think, helped because I, I had a certain protection by being there and also knowing when the Selektion process was going to, to happen.</span> <span id="s221">Because you could – in Auschwitz, the Selektion of people, the Selektion out to the crematorium, to the gas chambers would usually happen every six weeks.</span> <span id="s222">The Germans, with their efficiency, would never repeat things immediately or do things irregularly.</span> <span id="s223">So, you could expect things to happen every four to six weeks, and it usually happened with certain people arriving in the camp.</span> <span id="s224">And if you knew that was going to happen and if you were where I was, it gave you a certain amount of protection because you could hide and get out of, out of the way.</span> <span id="s225">And that certainly helped me, in some instances, to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">01:26:03</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: Can you tell me what working in a laundry consisted of?</span> <span id="s228">I mean, you survived this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">What did you do there?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: One of the things that I had to do was to go and fetch gas.</span> <span id="s231">Not very often, but I think two or three times – the same gas that was used for the gassing of people – this Zyklon C gas– to pick it up, for disinfecting purposes, from the crematorium to the, to the laundry.</span> <span id="s232">And that was, and that actually enabled me to go to get out of the camp.</span> <span id="s233">But basically, just go deliver a piece of paper from one place to another, and hang around.</span> <span id="s234">I certainly didn't work very hard.</span> <span id="s235">It wasn't, it wasn't a full-time job.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: In carrying the gas, did you know that it was the same kind of gas?</span> <span id="s237">Did you make a connection?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s239">You, you couldn't, you couldn't live in, in Birkenau without knowing what the gas was for.</span> <span id="s240">You have to visualize it.</span> <span id="s241">In the, in the Gypsy camp – that is to say, in the—each – there were a number of camps in Auschwitz, in Birkenau.</span> <span id="s242">They were basically streets with barracks on each side surrounded by barbed wire, and there was Camp D and C and B, and so forth.</span> <span id="s243">The, the gas chambers and crematories were at one side.</span> <span id="s244">You could stand, for example, outside your barracks in my camp, and see the smoke billowing out from the, from</span></p> <p><span id="s245">8 Zyklon B.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">the crematory.</span> <span id="s247">And not only the smoke, and even almost fire, but also the stench that would come out.</span> <span id="s248">So you couldn't be in any place in that environment and not know what was happening.</span> <span id="s249">And, of course, it was close enough almost to hear the screaming of, of people 'cause what happened usually, unlike in my case, people would come to Auschwitz at the railroad station, at the – would be unloaded and there separated – one group going into the camp, being allowed to go into the camp, and the others going directly to the gas chambers and the, and the crematory.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">01:28:36</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: Did you watch this often?</span> <span id="s252">Were you in a position to see this process?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: You – I could see it.</span> <span id="s254">To say that I watched it... You, you couldn't help but know what was going, going on.</span> <span id="s255">And as a matter of fact, towards the end, when I was – at the very end, when the crematory no longer functioned, we were struck at one point that that suddenly there were birds and other things.</span> <span id="s256">There, there was nothing before.</span> <span id="s257">It was really sort of a, a cloud hanging over the over the place.</span> <span id="s258">I was at one point, I was – later on – sort of taking the story forward – I was in a camp that was even closer to the gas chambers and the crematory, where you could really hear the screaming almost on a..</span> <span id="s259">.</span> <span id="s260">on a regular basis.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">01:29:40</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: Tell me about your parents at this point.</span> <span id="s263">You're in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s264">You were with your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">What happened to your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: When we came into Auschwitz, my father and I were separated from my mother.</span> <span id="s267">My mother was sent to the women's camp in, in Auschwitz, and my father and I were sent together to the, to the Gypsy camp.</span> <span id="s268">I saw my mother once during that, that period.</span> <span id="s269">I was able – I was sent on some – or had to go for something to the women's camp; and went just so I could, could see my mother, and we had – there were systems in which you could get some messages through from one group to the other.</span> <span id="s270">But otherwise there were just my, my father and I.</span> <span id="s271">We were, we were separated, I think, in October of 1944 or, or later – when there was another, when there was a Selektion.</span> <span id="s272">And that was the only time when I wasn't able to escape.</span> <span id="s273">I – there were many instances where I avoided the crematorium throughout that period of stay in, in Auschwitz; but that was the only time when, when I lost.</span> <span id="s274">I'd always taken this as sort of a battle between them and us.</span> <span id="s275">And I'd always won; because I was never caught up in any Selektion.</span> <span id="s276">I was always able to escape.</span> <span id="s277">But in the last one, my, my father and I, we – there was a Selektion of people to be sent out to another place, another camp, in Germany for work purposes.</span> <span id="s278">And Mengeleand a group of, of doctors were lined up.</span> <span id="s279">And they saw me as a child, and they motioned me to go one way, and my father go the other way.</span> <span id="s280">And that's the last I saw of my, my father.</span> <span id="s281">I was retained in the, in the barracks, where we were supposed to then be taken from there to the, to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s282">I knew that you 9 Josef Mengele (1911-1979?)</span> <span id="s283">, extermination camp doctor at Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">couldn't – you develop all kinds of expertise as a, as a child growing up.</span> <span id="s285">I tried to escape a number of times – couldn't, was caught, was beaten and gave up.</span> <span id="s286">At that point, I figured there was, there was no way.</span> <span id="s287">And I'd tried my best, but it was the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">01:32:23 What saved me was the fact that there weren't enough people to take to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s289">They made a decision to take us to the sick ward, instead, until they had a larger transport.</span> <span id="s290">And that's what they did.</span> <span id="s291">They took us to, to barracks in another camp, which is the camp closer to the crematorium,where all of the people had this serious skin disease.</span> <span id="s292">It was – in, in German it was called "Krätze."</span> <span id="s293">I don't know what it is in English, and I didn't develop it.</span> <span id="s294">There was a young Polish doctor, who kept giving me alcohol and other things, and told me what to do.</span> <span id="s295">One morning, I, I woke up.</span> <span id="s296">I – it was very difficult in that place to sort of separate nightmares from reality, because you heard the noises all the time.</span> <span id="s297">One morning, I woke up and the people I had come with were all gone.</span> <span id="s298">And what had happened was that the Polish doctor had torn up card with my name on it, which had a "X" in back, which meant that I was supposed to go.</span> <span id="s299">All the other people were taken out to the gas chamber, and I – he had written a new card for me, and I was saved.</span> <span id="s300">And so…From there, then, I went – was able to get out of that camp – with the help, curiously enough, of a German—to, to a work camp back in, in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">01:34:15</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: How did a German help you?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: I saw a German, and I approached him in German.</span> <span id="s304">Told him that I wasn't sick, I shouldn't be here, and I was afraid if I stayed here I would catch something – couldn't he help me get out?</span> <span id="s305">And he did.</span> <span id="s306">And I went to a camp – the D Lager– which was, which was sort of the major camp.</span> <span id="s307">And there was actually there were barracks that sort of children's barracks kids.</span> <span id="s308">I think all of them were older than, than I was.</span> <span id="s309">I, I was about ten at the time.</span> <span id="s310">There was a, a Kapo.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Not really a Kapo, but it was what is known as a Blockältester– the head of the, of the barracks, who had actually sort of indi – protected the children, saying that they could work.</span> <span id="s312">And he had a whole group of, of young kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">TECHNICAL PROBLEMS - LONG PAUSE - TECHNICAL CONVERSATION</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: We were in Lager D.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">10 Birkenau section B-IIf.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">11 Scabies (German).</span></p> <p><span id="s317">12 Birkenau section B-IId.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">13 “Block elder”: The head of a barracks row in the slave-labor and concentration camps, who was almost always a non-Jewish criminal.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: We were in Lager D, with a, with a group of, of children, and I really don't remember what we did there very much.</span> <span id="s320">But it – that the treatment on the whole, given how bad it had been in various other places, was not, not all that bad.</span> <span id="s321">We – there were two of us – three of us – who became friends.</span> <span id="s322">And we had to do all kinds of chores.</span> <span id="s323">I remember once we, we broke into the SS kitchen and I drank my first glass of milk in a, in a long time.</span> <span id="s324">If they had caught us, I suppose they would have beaten us to death.</span> <span id="s325">We did those things.</span> <span id="s326">We had to, I think what I remember we had to pick up garbage, and engage in those activities.</span> <span id="s327">But then that really didn't last very long because, in Janu – by January, the liquidation of, of Auschwitz happened.</span> <span id="s328">They lined us all up.</span> <span id="s329">They came in to announce that the ca – camp was being liquidated.</span> <span id="s330">Lined us up, gave us some food, and began to march us out of, out of the camp.</span> <span id="s331">And that started the famous death march out of Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">01:36:53 We were marched first for about three days, to a town in Upper Silesia called Gliwice.</span> <span id="s333">The, the, the three of us kids were together.</span> <span id="s334">The kids were put—the, the children's camp group was put in front when we first marched out.</span> <span id="s335">But it was – Polish January is cold, and we didn't – we carried blankets.</span> <span id="s336">But after about a 10, 12-hour walk that we began to, to be very tired.</span> <span id="s337">The children began to, to fall back.</span> <span id="s338">People from the back were pushing, that we weren't going fast enough.</span> <span id="s339">And whoever sat down was, was shot, within, within our view, by the guards who were on each side of the road.</span> <span id="s340">The three of us developed a system of resting which was to run up to the front, and then sort of stop almost, until we reached the back.</span> <span id="s341">And by that time, we had, we had rested, and then we could run up again and we would stay warm.</span> <span id="s342">And I don't know how long we did this, but at – suddenly in the evening there was – they stopped the column and asked for all the children to, to come forward, that they were going to be put in a farm, on a farm, and they didn't have to march anymore.</span> <span id="s343">Well, we had had experience.</span> <span id="s344">And we didn't go.</span> <span id="s345">And all the children from that group then were, were taken away and apparently shot.</span> <span id="s346">So we were the only three that, that stayed.</span> <span id="s347">We – and it wasn't easy.</span> <span id="s348">There were all kinds of—we, we carried bread, and people kept pushing to get the bread.</span> <span id="s349">And everybody had a slice of bread, food, clothes, blankets; and we, we couldn't carry them.</span> <span id="s350">After a while, we didn't have anything any more.</span> <span id="s351">After three days, we, we came to Gliwice, where they did another Selektion out.</span> <span id="s352">But the three of us managed to, to run.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">The, the test was whether you could run across some square, or something.</span> <span id="s354">And we together held each other up, and, and made it.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">01:39:40 That's in Gliwice.</span> <span id="s356">They put us on a train which took I think twelve days or so to get to the destination – my destination.</span> <span id="s357">The train stopped at another place, but that was Oranienburg – which is near Berlin – where the concentration camp of Sachsenhausen was.</span> <span id="s358">I suppose what is noteworthy about the train ride: again open cars, January 1945, Polish winters.</span> <span id="s359">The train was packed with people.</span> <span id="s360">You couldn't breathe.</span> <span id="s361">And if you were small, as, as we were, it was very difficult.</span> <span id="s362">By the time we arrived, you could walk in the car.</span> <span id="s363">People died in tremendous numbers of exposure, of hunger, everything else.</span> <span id="s364">And whenever somebody died, they were thrown overboard as the as the train moved.</span> <span id="s365">I think, in my, in my car alone there were no more than about ten people or so, when we when we arrived for the first time at the railroad station in Berlin.</span> <span id="s366">There you might have an interesting footnote to that experience: in Berlin, when we arrived, I heard a German woman say, "Es stinkt so wieder nach Juden" – which means, "It smells again of Jews."</span> <span id="s367">At the same time, a, a German – our German guard, who was sitting on our train – gave me a cup of coffee, which was the first warm thing I, I had had on this entire trip.</span> <span id="s368">We – well, the, the train eventually ended up in Oranienburg, in Heinkel – where there's a factory, airplane factory, where we were kept for about two weeks, I, I think.By that time, I – the cold was so bad I, I lost some – my, my legs were totally frostbitten, my hands.</span> <span id="s369">Eventually, the toes, some toes had to be amputated.</span> <span id="s370">But, you know, Oranienburg, in Heinkel, I remember taking off my shoes and never found my shoes again.</span> <span id="s371">They were, they were good shoes.</span> <span id="s372">We were there and nothing much happened.</span> <span id="s373">Then after two weeks, we were taken to the concentration camp of, of Sachsenhausen – which was a German Musterlager,which had been there already in the in the '30's.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">01:42:30 And was a – you came in, there was a big sign saying "Arbeit Macht das Leben Süss" – all of which, which is, "Work Makes Life Sweet."</span> <span id="s375">We were put in, in barracks there, after actually marching.</span> <span id="s376">And it was very difficult at that point for me to, to walk from Heinkel to Sachsenhausen.</span> <span id="s377">German kids were throwing stones at the group that was, that was marching.</span> <span id="s378">It was almost a relief to end up in the camp.</span> <span id="s379">I don't know how long I was there before I couldn't anymore, with my feet.</span> <span id="s380">My toes had turned totally black.</span> <span id="s381">And the, the – it wasn't pain; but the nerves were – I just, I couldn't sleep.</span> <span id="s382">I, I could feel everything.</span> <span id="s383">I then went to – they had a hospital there.</span> <span id="s384">And because it was a model camp, it was actually a well set-up hospital.</span> <span id="s385">I went there, went into a room.</span> <span id="s386">They looked at my foot.</span> <span id="s387">And before I knew it, four people grabbed, stretched me out on the table and operated right there on the table, with the I think chloroform or some other thing.</span> <span id="s388">They had to operate again because they hadn't – but the person who operated was a French military doctor, who was very good and very kind, and actually saved my leg, because gangrene would have set in.</span> <span id="s389">It was black.</span> <span id="s390">He saved my other foot – I didn't loose any, any toes on, on my other foot.</span> <span id="s391">My, my hands were, were fine.</span> <span id="s392">And then I ended up in the hospital, which, again, was a hospital where usually, after a few weeks, you would be – you would be cured only to be to be killed.</span> <span id="s393">But it was coming to the end of the war.</span> <span id="s394">And actually the camp, the Russians came to the camp in, in April of 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">So I was, I think, in the, in the hospital ward for about four to six weeks; and was, was helped a lot by, by Norwegians, and others, who so saved my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">01:45:09 14 The Heinkel facility was a subcamp of Sachsenhausen.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">15 “Model Camp.”</span> <span id="s398">Camp after which other camps were modeled.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: Tell me, if you would, about your stay in that hospital ward and your meetings with the Norwegians.</span> <span id="s400">What – first, what was the ward like?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: Oh, just a big barracks with, with beds where people – some were dying, some had...had minor injuries.</span> <span id="s402">A lot of people -different thing.</span> <span id="s403">Every so often, people would be taken out, people would be released.</span> <span id="s404">The Selektion was made of people who were actually taken out and, and killed, without most of us knowing what was going on.</span> <span id="s405">They were called out.</span> <span id="s406">The Norwegians received packages from the Norwegian Red Cross, or the Swedish Red Cross.</span> <span id="s407">And befriended me and helped me immensely, with – especially a man by the name of Fridtjof Nan – Odd Nansen – the son of Fridtjof Nansenwho was in the camp – helped me with – both with food, and also I think with giving food to the people in the ward to, to protect me.</span> <span id="s408">It was curious.</span> <span id="s409">The, the one thing that I remember from that ward is something which we – which people who haven't been in camps don't realize.</span> <span id="s410">That when all of this terrible tragedy and terrible conditions that were going on, people still had a great sense of humor.</span> <span id="s411">It, it didn't leave us.</span> <span id="s412">Let me give you one example: in this hospital ward, we had as a ventilator just a hole in the roof, which was plugged up with a piece of wood.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Sachsenhausen, as I said, was about twenty kilometers outside of Berlin.</span> <span id="s414">And when the Allies bombed Berlin, the planes would fly over Sachsenhausen.</span> <span id="s415">There's another story to this, which I can tell you later.</span> <span id="s416">But at any rate, the bombing, of course, the bombs would fall pretty close.</span> <span id="s417">And one day, there, there was a very severe bombing attack, and people were getting out of their beds because of the fear that the barracks would be bombed.</span> <span id="s418">And, and there it was all wood and would have been burned.</span> <span id="s419">And suddenly there was a tremendous crash of a bomb falling, and a man screaming he's been killed by the bomb.</span> <span id="s420">But what had happened was that the piece of wood that had plugged up the ventilator had fallen down, and just fallen on him.</span> <span id="s421">And, you know – despite this environment we were in – that whole block of people, maybe a hundred dying people, burst into a roar of laughter which I still remember to this day – about the fact that this poor man thought he had died already.</span> <span id="s422">There were many instances of that going on.</span> <span id="s423">The other thing which, in which we took great pride and joy was that when the bombing raids came, the, the German officers' families and influential Germans would hide in the camp from the bombing attack.</span> <span id="s424">Because the bo – the the camp was known to the Allies; and they avoided bombing it.</span> <span id="s425">As a matter of fact, at night they would drop flares around the camp, in order not to bomb it.</span> <span id="s426">And so it was really the safest place nearby.</span> <span id="s427">And that, to us, we were beginning to feel that the war, that we were maybe winning.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">01:49:04</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: This is a good moment to change tapes, I think.</span> <span id="s430">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">16 Fridtjof Nansen (1861-1930); Norwegian explorer, Nobel peace prize winner.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">TAPE #2</span></p> <p><span id="s433">02:00:03</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: Okay, in the hospital, you tell me that you were befriended by Norwegians – particularly Odd Nansen.</span> <span id="s435">Can you tell me something about him, and about your relationship with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: Well, he, he would come and visit various Norwegians in the, in the hospital; and that's how we, we met.</span> <span id="s437">He, he was writing a diary in the camp.</span> <span id="s438">I, of course, didn't know about it at the time.</span> <span id="s439">I found out after the war.</span> <span id="s440">So he, he came by, talked to a lot of people; and then, when he found out that I was there and that I'd come from Auschwitz, he befriended me.</span> <span id="s441">And came and visited me almost every week, or maybe even more often and would bring me cookies and try and make sure that I was all right.</span> <span id="s442">And brought me ex – as a matter of fact, brought me paper and a pencil to draw.</span> <span id="s443">And what, of course, I didn't know was that he wrote down a lot of things about my experiences at the time.</span> <span id="s444">He was a wonderful man, who had – really a great humanitarian; very much in the tradition of his father, who was Fridtjof Nansen – the High Commissioner for Refugees during the League of Nations time, after whom the, the Nansen Passport is named.</span> <span id="s445">But he, he helped me immensely.</span> <span id="s446">I, I think he, he saved my life.</span> <span id="s447">He was then shipped out of the camp shortly before the, the end of the war, when Count Bernadottewas able to get the Norwegians and Danes out of the camp and get them to Sweden.</span> <span id="s448">At that point we, we didn't see each other again.</span> <span id="s449">And after the war, when having survived I, I tried to, to find him, couldn't remember his name – only knew that he, that he had a very famous Norwegian name.</span> <span id="s450">But wanted to find him and wanted to thank him.</span> <span id="s451">I didn't find him until about 1947 or '48, when my mother read in the newspaper that a book had been published.</span> <span id="s452">It was a diary of the concentration camp that, among other things dealt with Sachsenhausen.</span> <span id="s453">And that it was a Norwegian who had published it.</span> <span id="s454">At that point, we, we wrote to him, asking whether he knew that, who that Norwegian might be who helped me in the camp.</span> <span id="s455">And, of course, it was he.</span> <span id="s456">There's a great story to this because I – mail, of course, was very slow in those days, after the war.</span> <span id="s457">Food was very scarce.</span> <span id="s458">We didn't hear from him for – we didn't receive an answer to the letter for about four or six weeks.</span> <span id="s459">And one day, there's a knock at the door in the house where we lived in Germany – in Göttingen – and up pulled a Norwegian military truck.</span> <span id="s460">And the soldier came out, and asked whether this was our home.</span> <span id="s461">And we said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s462">And he said he had a little package for us.</span> <span id="s463">And so we said, "Well, give it to us."</span> <span id="s464">And he said, "No, no.</span> <span id="s465">It's, – we need to carry it."</span> <span id="s466">And they – then a group of Norwegian soldiers jumped out of the car, and brought this tremendous crate – wooden crate – of food that had been collected by Norwegian children, with a letter from him.</span> <span id="s467">And shortly thereafter, he came and actually took me to Norway for a few weeks.</span> <span id="s468">And – because he had thought that I had died in the camp.</span> <span id="s469">And the book, in fact, that he published about the camp – the diary – was dedicated to me, among other people, on the assumption that I hadn't survived the – the camp.</span> <span id="s470">So it was a wonderful reunion when we when we finally got together.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">17 Folke Bernadotte (1895-1948); Swedish statesman, Count of Wisbourg and nephew of King Gustav V.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">02:04:21</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: Okay, let's go back to you in the hospital.</span> <span id="s474">When were you released from the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: I really wasn't.</span> <span id="s476">The camp – the Germans lost the war before I was released from the hospital, or rather, they had to leave the, the camp.</span> <span id="s477">Again, this camp was to be liquidated, and people were lined up to march out of the camp.</span> <span id="s478">We, we really couldn't walk, and the people in the hospital ward were left behind.</span> <span id="s479">And we assumed that they would come in and shoot everybody in our beds, and it was extremely – I remember the day when people lined up, and then it became extremely quiet.</span> <span id="s480">And you couldn't hear anything.</span> <span id="s481">You only – and we waited, basically, on the assumption that any minute now they would, they would come in.</span> <span id="s482">Nothing happened.</span> <span id="s483">And of all the people in that, in the barracks, I probably could move better.</span> <span id="s484">By then, I had a crutch; and I could move on, on one leg.</span> <span id="s485">And finally, I went out to look.</span> <span id="s486">With all this silence.</span> <span id="s487">And the machine gun on the gate of the—overlooking the, the sort of plaza in the camp was empty, for the first time.</span> <span id="s488">And the Germans had left.</span> <span id="s489">You – by then, you could hear already the rumbling of artillery in – in the background.</span> <span id="s490">And there wasn't a soul to be seen.</span> <span id="s491">Nothing happened for a while, except, you know, we, we realized that maybe we were, we were going to live.</span> <span id="s492">The shooting came closer.</span> <span id="s493">Eventually the gates swung open and Russian troops came in.</span> <span id="s494">And they began ringing the, the camp bell to say that we were free.</span> <span id="s495">There was – that, that was freedom.</span> <span id="s496">And the first thing, of course, that happened then was that anybody who could move stormed into the German, where the Germans kept provisions, and tried to grab as much food as, as possible.</span> <span id="s497">I had eaten so little in that time that I couldn't eat.</span> <span id="s498">I remember the only thing I took was a pickle.</span> <span id="s499">I found a pickle, and, and I ate it.</span> <span id="s500">And maybe that's what saved me, actually, because people died by simply eating too much, and not having eaten for a long time and not being used to, to the food.</span> <span id="s501">As a matter of fact, I'll come back to that later.</span> <span id="s502">I couldn't eat for anything very much, for weeks after my, my liberation.</span> <span id="s503">Just couldn't.</span> <span id="s504">Could barely eat anything more than a piece of, of dry bread, but a lot of people ate and got extremely sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">02:07:33 The Russians did nothing, really.</span> <span id="s506">There was no – unlike from what I hear about the camps that were liberated by the British or American troops, or French troops, there was no doctors sent in.</span> <span id="s507">No first aid.</span> <span id="s508">No supplies.</span> <span id="s509">Nothing.</span> <span id="s510">We were just simply told we were free, and we could go.</span> <span id="s511">And the direction we should go was away from Berlin, because Berlin was still not, not captured.</span> <span id="s512">This was about April 20th or so, 1945.</span> <span id="s513">And so whoever could move, went.</span> <span id="s514">And there was with me in, in the hospital a, a Pole who he and I got up, and we decided to try to...to move, to...to go, leave the camp.</span> <span id="s515">And we got out into Sachsen – into Oranienburg, the town where Sachsenhausen was, and there the houses were empty.</span> <span id="s516">The Germans had, left their homes, left food almost on the table, and, and had left, and we sort of 18 Sachsenhausen was liberated April 27, 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">moved from one place to another, from one of these homes to another, until we came upon a group of the – a Polish division under Russian command – the First Division Kosciusko And by then we had accumulated a group of people, about five or six people, all from Poland.</span> <span id="s518">The – the Polish soldiers saw me, assumed I was Polish.</span> <span id="s519">I, I spoke Polish.</span> <span id="s520">And didn't they had to speak German at the time, of course.</span> <span id="s521">And asked me whether I was from Poland; and I said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s522">And then they said, well, they'll take me to Poland.</span> <span id="s523">And so what they did was take me along in with their group.</span> <span id="s524">And their – this particular group was the scout company of the First Polish Division.</span> <span id="s525">And I became the mascot of the, of the Division.</span> <span id="s526">I was given a horse and a, a little cart.</span> <span id="s527">As a matter of fact, they had, they had captured a German circus, and this was a small pony.</span> <span id="s528">I had my pony, and moved with the troops.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">02:09:56 And actually, I always say I helped capture Berlin with my troops because we actually moved on Berlin.</span> <span id="s530">And I was in Berlin before Berlin fell, because the, the troops came in.</span> <span id="s531">The Russians had already advanced, Russian troops had already moved in.</span> <span id="s532">But I was in Berlin before Berlin fell, on the outskirts of Berlin – actually, in Berlin with Polish, troops.</span> <span id="s533">It's never mentioned that Polish troops were in Berlin among the conquerors, and it, it's true.</span> <span id="s534">We, we were there.</span> <span id="s535">We, actually, until Germany surrendered I was – we were still following German troops beyond Berlin.</span> <span id="s536">After the fall of Germany, the Polish troops were being moved back to, to Poland.</span> <span id="s537">And I was moving back with them.</span> <span id="s538">And we initially moved to a, to a military garrison in Poland called Siedlce.</span> <span id="s539">It's a town in, in Poland, where I've spent some time until a, a Jewish-Polish soldier in my company took me out one day and took me to a Jewish orphanage in Otwock and left me there, and there were a lot of Jewish children in that in the orphanage, that we – for the first time, I sort of began to live something of a, of a normal life.</span> <span id="s540">The period in the orphanage is interesting – again, as a sort of historical footnote because our orphanage was an orphanage run by the Jewish Bund, which was a socialist communist Jewish organization that didn't want people to go to Palestine then.</span> <span id="s541">At the same time, the Zionist group – the Ha-Shomer Ha-Za’ir– had more or less infiltrated the orphanage.</span> <span id="s542">And there was one counselor who got all of us who wan – those who wanted to go to, to Israel – it was then Palestine – put the names on a list.</span> <span id="s543">And would then run away, one by one, to the Zionist kibbutz in Poland, or camp.</span> <span id="s544">And from – and would be shipped from there to Palestine, and I signed up for this group.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">02:12:41 Problem was that, that I was the only one who had been in Auschwitz and in other camps.</span> <span id="s546">And so the decision was made that I should run away last because I would be interviewed on newsreel and on radio about my camp, and they thought that if I ran away it would blow the 19 The Tadeusz Kosciusko Division appeared in July 1943 and was comprised of Polish patriots under Russian command.</span> <span id="s547">Alexander Werth.</span> <span id="s548">Russia at War.</span> <span id="s549">(New York: Carrol and Graf Publishers, Inc., 1964), 653.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">20 Zionist youth movement directed at educating Jewish youth for kibbutz life in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">whole operation.</span> <span id="s552">So I was put on to, on the list.</span> <span id="s553">The list was sent to the Jewish Agency for Palestine, to Jerusalem, but I was told that I would be told when to run away, but I would be the last person.</span> <span id="s554">In the meantime, something unbelievable happened.</span> <span id="s555">My mother had survived the camp.</span> <span id="s556">And my brother, my mother's brother was here in the United States.</span> <span id="s557">And they began looking for me all over, of course, after the war.</span> <span id="s558">And they couldn't find me.</span> <span id="s559">My mother never gave up hope that I was alive.</span> <span id="s560">Everybody told her, "It's impossible that he survived."</span> <span id="s561">But she believed that I survived.</span> <span id="s562">And among other places where they looked, of course, was the Jewish Agency for Palestine.</span> <span id="s563">Somebody in the Search Bureau of the Jewish Agency for Palestine noticed that there was a child in an orphanage in Poland who was going to be coming to Palestine, who met the description of the child that the woman was looking for in Germany and notified my uncle in the United States.</span> <span id="s564">And that's how they, how I was eventually reunited with my mother.</span> <span id="s565">What happened was that, the, the – it wasn't all that easy to leave Poland, you know, I had no papers or anything else.</span> <span id="s566">And my mother was in Germany at the time, in the, in the British zone, so the American Joint Distribution Committee basically smuggled me out in December of 1946 from Poland to Czechoslovakia, Czechoslovakia to the American zone, and then the American zone to the British zone in Germany, until I was reunited with my mother.</span> <span id="s567">And there was the Joint operated with the Brichahwhich had bribed a lot of people on the border.</span> <span id="s568">And that's how I got to Germany in '46.</span> <span id="s569">That was really three years after I'd been separated from my mother.</span> <span id="s570">But the – I think the most telling thing is, is the faith that my mother had that I was alive.</span> <span id="s571">And there was no way for anybody to shake her in the belief that, that I was alive.</span> <span id="s572">And I, I really never looked.</span> <span id="s573">I assumed that if my mother or father were alive, they were going to find me.</span> <span id="s574">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s575">02:15:43</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: Can you describe that meeting?</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: It's emotionally a little hard, except to say that, that we met on the railroad station outside of Göttingen, which is in northern Germany.</span> <span id="s578">She had gone to a, a station earlier, and I recognized her, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: Where did you go once you and your mother were reunited?</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: You'll be surprised to hear it when I say to school, as a good academic.</span> <span id="s581">No, what I – what we did was Göttingen was my mother's home town.</span> <span id="s582">My father and mother had a, had different meeting places that they had agreed upon if they survived the war.</span> <span id="s583">One was in Kielce.</span> <span id="s584">My mother had actually gone back to Kielce – walked from Germany.</span> <span id="s585">She was liberated out not far from Ravensbrück.</span> <span id="s586">Walked, got back, mainly walking, into Kielce looking for us; escaped out of Kielce, left Kielce just a few days becau – before the pogrom after the war 21 Literally “flight” (Hebrew).</span> <span id="s587">The attempted movement of around 250,000 Jews from Eastern and

which he refers took place on July 4, 1946.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">got back to Göttingen because that's where, where she had grown up, where my great grandparents lived, and waited for my father.</span> <span id="s592">I came, and I had really no schooling whatsoever, and we lived in Göttingen.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">02:17:23 So I was put – I was taught a year of private tutoring, and then enrolled in the high school in Göttingen.</span> <span id="s594">And was the – the only Jewish kid in – in school in that town, and the only Jewish kid that anybody in that town – at least, the children – had seen.</span> <span id="s595">Which was, in itself, an experience because they always expected to find somebody with a long nose, and, you know, all the caricatures out of the Stürmer and other German newspapers.</span> <span id="s596">Initially it was difficult.</span> <span id="s597">One, one is – ort of comes with a certain hatred to the town of the people who did all of this.</span> <span id="s598">And initially, I had this desire of sitting on my balcony to take a machine gun and shoot everybody who – then, gradually, you meet the children and their parents; and the abstract of the Germans becomes the reality of human beings.</span> <span id="s599">And you sort of gradually shed the hatred, and you integrate in the town and in the school.</span> <span id="s600">It helped to – we spoke about Nansen before.</span> <span id="s601">One of the things that I didn't mention was that when Nansen's book was published in German he gave the proceeds for that book to German refugees.</span> <span id="s602">And his whole approach to the Holocaust and to the problem was one of reconciliation.</span> <span id="s603">And that made a great impression on me, living in that environment and seeing people who hadn't participated in these killings.</span> <span id="s604">But I, I never really felt at home in any sense, in, in Germany; although I was treated well.</span> <span id="s605">Made a lot of friends.</span> <span id="s606">Then, in 1951, I, I came to the United States.</span> <span id="s607">I came initially alone, just to stay for one year.</span> <span id="s608">Came to live with my uncle, who lived in New Jersey.</span> <span id="s609">And never went back.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: What did your mother do?</span> <span id="s611">02:20:00</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: My mother remarried; stayed initially in Germany, but really remarried.</span> <span id="s613">And she and her husband, who had been also in, in camp, in some of our camps, went to Italy.</span> <span id="s614">He had some relatives in Italy who were in business, and he went to live in Italy.</span> <span id="s615">She never came to the United – I mean, she came to visit often, but she never came to live in this country.</span> <span id="s616">She had this strange notion that if she came to the United States she'd have to work in a factory.</span> <span id="s617">And having worked during the war, she wasn't going to – despite the fact that we tried to disabuse her of this, it never worked.</span> <span id="s618">She still comes to visit only.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: And when you came here, you did work in a factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A: Yes, but – I, well, I came.</span> <span id="s621">I had a wonderful – my uncle and aunt were wonderful to me.</span> <span id="s622">They took me in.</span> <span id="s623">Was just living as a – I mean, obviously it was my family; but they, they weren't wealthy.</span> <span id="s624">They were, they were people who themselves worked in the factory and stores.</span> <span id="s625">They took me in.</span> <span id="s626">They had one daughter, and they treated me like a son.</span> <span id="s627">And I came in December.</span> <span id="s628">In January, I was in high school in Paterson, New Jersey, and became a high school student like everybody else in the United States and enjoyed it very much.</span> <span id="s629">I, I liked it.</span> <span id="s630">I was treated very well.</span> <span id="s631">They – I was tremendously impressed with the very different atmosphere in the high school from the German environment.</span> <span id="s632">Germany was academically higher.</span> <span id="s633">The American high schools are a wonderful laboratory of democracy in so many ways.</span> <span id="s634">I liked it very much.</span> <span id="s635">And the teachers, I felt, were very good.</span> <span id="s636">And they helped me immensely.</span> <span id="s637">And they helped me get into college, and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: Is there anything you'd like to add?</span> <span id="s639">Any part of the story you want to fill in?</span> <span id="s640">02:22:31</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: Well, you know, I, I think I, I should go on with the, with the college story, in a sense because it, it's sort of relevant I think for Americans too, in many ways.</span> <span id="s642">It's almost part of Americana in its, in its true sense.</span> <span id="s643">I – when I went to high school, of course, I knew nothing about what one does from there on on.</span> <span id="s644">All I knew was that I wanted to go and become a lawyer, and, and, and write.</span> <span id="s645">And, of course, to many people that seemed totally outrageous.</span> <span id="s646">For somebody who had just come, that you'd be able to go to university, being an immigrant, and so forth.</span> <span id="s647">But I had a wonderful advisor – college advisor—in, in high school, who gave me a list of, of ten colleges.</span> <span id="s648">And she said all small colleges, that I should write to.</span> <span id="s649">And she told me what to write, asking for a scholarship and admission, and that's what I did.</span> <span id="s650">The problem was that most of the colleges, on seeing my record looked at it and saw that here was this kid who had had no school—except basically two and a half years of school in, in Germany and about a year of high school in New Jersey, and he wanted to go to college and he wanted a scholarship.</span> <span id="s651">So the reaction from most of them was: "Well, we'd admit you, but we can't give you a scholarship until we see how you perform in the first year."</span> <span id="s652">Well, I couldn't, couldn't afford it.</span> <span id="s653">One college I'd written to for a catalog – which was the sort of the first step – was Bethany College in, in West Virginia.</span> <span id="s654">And Bethany College, I received the catalog.</span> <span id="s655">I opened the catalog, and it said, "This is a Christian college."</span> <span id="s656">Coming from Europe, with my experience, I thought that meant that, that they didn't want me.</span> <span id="s657">So I didn't apply.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">And time went by – a number of weeks, or months.</span> <span id="s659">One day I get called to the, my counselor's office.</span> <span id="s660">And she says that "There is somebody here from Bethany College who would like to meet you."</span> <span id="s661">And I'm introduced.</span> <span id="s662">And the first thing the person says to me is, "Why—you, you, you wrote to Bethany, we sent you the catalog.</span> <span id="s663">Why didn't you send in your application?"</span> <span id="s664">I hemmed and hawed, and didn't quite know how to explain this.</span> <span id="s665">Finally, I told him the truth.</span> <span id="s666">And he said, "Oh, this isn't the case at all!</span> <span id="s667">I can tell you that if you apply to Bethany College, we'll give you a scholarship and a job.</span> <span id="s668">And you can – you won't need a penny in order to graduate from school if you, you know, do well."</span> <span id="s669">And that's where I went.</span> <span id="s670">And they were—this, this is a school that's founded by the Disciples of Christ.</span> <span id="s671">I found it to be an extremely liberal school.</span> <span id="s672">Nobody cared what religion I had.</span> <span id="s673">They treated me wonderfully.</span> <span id="s674">I got a good education.</span> <span id="s675">I went on from there to New York University and to Harvard Law School.</span> <span id="s676">And – but they were the ones who gave me this, this wonderful break.</span> <span id="s677">The schools, the, the supposedly "better" schools, in quotation marks, weren't going to take a chance.</span> <span id="s678">And I've always been extremely grateful to, to Bethany College.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: That's quite a story.</span> <span id="s680">That's – thank you.</span> <span id="s681">Very much.</span> <span id="s682">That's it.</span> <span id="s683">02:26:57</span></p> <p><span id="s684">TECHNICAL
