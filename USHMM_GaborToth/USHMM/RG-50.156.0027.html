Riley, Kansas, basic training, and was assigned to a reconnaissance unit, and then spent some time on the west coast, and then went to Texas for combat training, and went overseas December, 1944.</span> <span id="s16">To Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: What unit were you with and when and where did you land?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: We were a kind of unit by itself, and that was the 107th Reconnaissance unit.</span> <span id="s19">We landed at Le Havre and then got assigned, to, I think, the 101st Airborne.</span> <span id="s20">I think we joined them just as they were breaking out of the Bulge.</span> <span id="s21">And then, somehow or other, we got assigned to the 10th Armored division.</span> <span id="s22">It’s a little vague at this point, as to the sequence and the units and so forth, but we ended up moving across the Rhine and into Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: Which battles, which cities?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: I know we were in Strasbourg, that’s where we crossed the Rhine.</span> <span id="s25">I don’t recall some of the other towns that we went through.</span> <span id="s26">I know as the war was starting to wind down we did end up for some time in the Alps.</span> <span id="s27">Brenner Pass, I guess it was called.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: Now this was already moving towards spring, about March?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: The only thing I remember about it is that there was snow.</span> <span id="s30">But I just don’t remember the sequence of events.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: Now, you said you arrived at Dachau.</span> <span id="s32">Had you read in Stars and Stripes about the concentration camps, or had you heard anything about them?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: I don’t know how I knew about them.</span> <span id="s34">I was thinking about that and I just don’t know how I knew about ‘em.</span> <span id="s35">But I did know about them for some reason or another.</span> <span id="s36">I’m not sure that any of us knew the extent of it.</span> <span id="s37">This probably would have been like April of ’45, I would guess.</span> <span id="s38">Things were moving fairly quickly at that point, and we were a reconnaissance unit so we were generally ahead of everybody else most of the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: What did a reconnaissance unit do?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: Basically you were out there riding along in your jeeps and armored cars, trying to determine where the enemy was in advance of other units, and radioing back.</span> <span id="s41">We used to go on scouting missions at night, and those got a little bit scary.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: What rank were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: Corporal.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: Were you on a reconnaissance when you came to Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: Try to walk me through it, then.</span> <span id="s47">How did you get there, and what were your feelings?</span> <span id="s48">As much as you can remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: It’s very vague at this point.</span> <span id="s50">As I say, we were moving quite rapidly at that point, and we moved into the Dachau area, along with other troops.</span> <span id="s51">And the people were coming out of the camp, and it just seems like there was a lot of confusion at that point, and there was just a lot of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: American soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: There was a lot of American soldiers and there was just a lot of people coming out of the camp, and there was civilians and there’s Germans.</span> <span id="s54">I recall I chose not to go into the camp, and again, at this point, I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s55">I don’t remember that I realized at that point or how I realized at that point, what was going on.</span> <span id="s56">The only thing I did know was that these people who were coming out of the camps in their blue and white striped robes were Jews and so it had particular significance to me and when they would come out of the camps, the first thing they were doing was looking for food.</span> <span id="s57">They were in the garbage cans and everything else, and of course we had rations which we gave to them, and most of the soldiers did, as a matter of fact, but the most amazing thing to me was the fact that some of those people were still able to walk, because they looked like they were dead.</span> <span id="s58">But still they were walking, and they were surviving, and they were looking for food.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: Can you describe what they looked like?</span> <span id="s60">Draw me a word-picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: They were just very thin and emaciated looking people.</span> <span id="s62">I mean, the thinnest people I have ever seen.</span> <span id="s63">The most emaciated people that I had ever seen.</span> <span id="s64">There was a lot of confusion and a lot of emotion going on at that point because they were being released.</span> <span id="s65">We were effectively moving to mop up at that point, and I don’t even remember how long we were there.</span> <span id="s66">But we left the area shortly thereafter.</span> <span id="s67">That’s the last contact I had.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: And you don’t remember what else you thought, what else you felt, when you were standing outside those gates.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: No, I really don’t.</span> <span id="s70">I think that we were so much involved in the war, and trying to survive, and as I said, things were moving very rapidly at that point, and we liberated not only the people in Dachau but there were many other forced labor groups that we liberated, Poles and whatever they were.</span> <span id="s71">So there were just lots of people wandering the countryside, and one of the things I do remember is that we were also at that time hunting for SS men.</span> <span id="s72">Again, we were a reconnaissance unit and we were out somewhat by ourselves.</span> <span id="s73">We knew that the SS men had escaped into the forests, and we had also captured lots of weapons, pistols and small arms weapons, and we turned those over to all these refugees that were wandering the countryside, and told them to go look for the Germans.</span> <span id="s74">(Laughs) It’s kind of interesting, because they would go into the forests and pretty soon you’d hear shots, which was okay with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: These were camp personnel.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: These were forced labor that had been in labor camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: No, I mean the SS people.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: I don’t know who they were.</span> <span id="s79">They were identified as SS people, and I suppose they were supervisors and upper echelon, because the other thing, too, is that when you get into April of ’45, the German army consisted of everything.</span> <span id="s80">They were old people and kids, and cripples, and disabled people.</span> <span id="s81">They were still fighting but with make-shift type outfits and weapons.</span> <span id="s82">So there were lots and lots of prisoners being taken.</span> <span id="s83">There was just a lot of people.</span> <span id="s84">We were advancing quite rapidly at that point, and things were really breaking down fast, maybe towards the second half of April.</span> <span id="s85">The war was effectively over, it was a matter of mopping up.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: The war ended on May 8, officially.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: Right.</span> <span id="s88">But it was really over before that, and it was a matter of mopping up.</span> <span id="s89">So we were involved in the mopping up exercise.</span> <span id="s90">I remember giving weapons to all of the refugees and saying, “Here, you go find them.”</span> <span id="s91">We had enough of going looking for them, and if we found ‘em, fine, and if we didn’t…That’s basically what I remember about that era.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: You were giving these people your K-rations to eat.</span> <span id="s93">Were you also giving them some clothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s95">No, I think it was mostly whatever rations we had.</span> <span id="s96">We had no problem getting more of course; it was just giving them food.</span> <span id="s97">There was still little or no communication with them that I can remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: You didn’t find anybody, you didn’t talk to any ex-prisoner who spoke some English?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: No, actually we had assignments, and we didn’t have the time to just sit there and observe.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: You didn’t have time to chat.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s102">The war went on, you know.</span> <span id="s103">This was just part of it, and there were units that were coming in behind us that were going to take care of the resettlement and everything, and we just continued on because, we were a part of the initial units that were moving ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: You don’t have any specific recollections about the labor camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: No, not really.</span> <span id="s106">I just remember certain things about it.</span> <span id="s107">We just gave ‘em their weapons and said, “You go find ‘em,” and we just continued on.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: When were you discharged from service?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: Well, the war ended in May, officially, and we ended up in a place I think that was called Lechbruk.</span> <span id="s110">And then we got transferred to a camp outside of Marseille, France, because we were going from Europe to Japan with the invasion which supposedly was going to take place in November of ’45.</span> <span id="s111">We sailed out of Marseille like August 10th or 11th of 1945 and when the war ended we were on our way through the Panama Canal, or in that direction, and the war ended and they sent us back to the states.</span> <span id="s112">We landed in Virginia, and we were all given 45-day furloughs, and then I was assigned to Camp McCoy.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: In Wisconsin.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s115">Awaiting discharge, and I was doing different administrative work, and that was a discharge center.</span> <span id="s116">But I was discharged in December of 1945, based on points.</span> <span id="s117">I don’t remember how many points were involved.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: You got points for how many months you’d been in combat.</span> <span id="s119">And then you came to the University of Minnesota.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: Well not right away.</span> <span id="s121">I worked for a cousin of mine.</span> <span id="s122">We were going to open up a plant in California and one cousin went out to look for a plant and I worked for another cousin here, learning the business, and that broke down, so I ended up starting university in the fall of ’46.</span> <span id="s123">And I graduated in July of ’49.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: That was what we used to refer to as “The Year of Our Veteran One” at the University.</span> <span id="s125">It was when all the servicemen came home and started college on the G.I. Bill.</span> <span id="s126">That’s interesting, because I knew you then, and I remember that some of the fellows would talk about some of them had malaria, some of the ones who’d been in the South Pacific; sometimes, rarely, they would talk about their experiences, but did you ever talk to anybody about what you had seen in the concentration camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: No.</span> <span id="s128">We never talked about it.</span> <span id="s129">We’d talk about incidents that took place, but as a general rule, it was seldom we talked about what went on.</span> <span id="s130">I guess we wanted to get on with our lives.</span> <span id="s131">We just wanted to be home.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: And so you’ve never talked to anybody about this.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: No.</span> <span id="s134">Not really.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: Not discussed it with your wife, or your children.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: Not as a general rule.</span> <span id="s137">You know, somehow or other, it might come up in a conversation.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: A lot of fellows took pictures.</span> <span id="s139">You were not taking any pictures at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: The last thing I usually ask people when I’m interviewing them is, what did I forget to ask you?</span> <span id="s142">Is there something else you would like to talk about, that’s come to your mind?</span> <span id="s143">How do you evaluate this?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: How do I evaluate the experience of being in the service and seeing all of that?</span> <span id="s145">The whole thing?</span> <span id="s146">Not for publication.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: You mean you want me to turn the tape recorder off?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: No, I guess I don’t want to comment on it, because I have my own feelings about it, as I’m sure most Jewish people do.</span> <span id="s149">It’s a peculiar situation, in that there’s no way that I would want to go through that experience again, and yet there’s no way you can substitute that experience.</span> <span id="s150">And it frankly took a long time to get over it, and there were many nights when I used to have nightmares.</span> <span id="s151">I didn’t realize it, I didn’t realize that I was that affected by the war, but I know that for some time I would wake up from bad dreams about the war, and I would also have bad dreams about being drafted again, and that type of thing.</span> <span id="s152">It goes on for a lot of years.</span> <span id="s153">Just occasionally, it’s nothing serious or anything like that, but it’s amazing how it pops back in your head every once in a while.</span> <span id="s154">A lot of the relationships that you develop with other people and then you get out of the service and they eventually disappear and you go on with your life, that’s what happens.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: Has it meant anything, do you think as a Jew, as a member of the Jewish community?</span> <span id="s156">Has it made any difference, do you think, to you, in your feeling about being a Jew and being a member of the Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: Oh, I suppose it has, but I think I’ve always felt very Jewish, not necessarily observant, but I’ve grown up in a Jewish community and spent most of my youth at the Jewish Center in St. Paul, and high school was half Jewish, and so I’ve always felt very Jewish.</span> <span id="s158">I’ve also always felt that Jews are very unique people.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: Well, that’s not good or bad, but, well, I don’t know how to explain it.</span> <span id="s161">First of all, the fact they survived, that’s number one.</span> <span id="s162">And there is a feeling between Jews that I don’t understand, because if you go anywhere and you run into a Jew, you feel like you’ve run into a relative, you know.</span> <span id="s163">And if something happens to someone that’s Jewish you have a totally different reaction than if that person is not Jewish.</span> <span id="s164">I don’t know how to explain it, nor have I spent any time trying to figure it out, but it’s just a part of being Jewish.</span> <span id="s165">We have some kind of bond that exists between us whether we know each other or not.</span> <span id="s166">That doesn’t mean that all of us love each other, but there’s something special that exists with most Jewish people, and I don’t know what it is.</span> <span id="s167">Maybe it’s the fact that we know what our background is, and we know that we were all subject to anti-Semitism as we were growing up.</span> <span id="s168">So maybe that’s part of it.</span> <span id="s169">And historically we know what’s happened to the Jews, and the Holocaust, the whole thing -- how these people survived -- but they have.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: Do you know any Holocaust survivors?</span> <span id="s171">Do you include them among your friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: Well, the Eigers, of course.</span> <span id="s173">And Dora Zaidenweber.</span> <span id="s174">[Kamman and Zaidenweber are accountants with the firm of Lurie, Eiger and Besikof.</span> <span id="s175">Dora Zaidenweber is David Eiger’s sister.]</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: But you don’t discuss this with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: No, I really haven’t.</span> <span id="s178">As a matter of fact, David and Barbara Eiger invited Gloria and me out to dinner, I suppose it was 1985, because it was the fortieth anniversary of the liberation, and they invited us out to dinner because I was part of the units that liberated David.</span> <span id="s179">But generally we don’t have any discussion about it, and there may be others that I know that were in one of the camps.</span> <span id="s180">Off hand I don’t know who they are.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: You mentioned in passing that you had known anti-Semitism growing up in St. Paul.</span> <span id="s182">Do you remember any specific incidents or just a feeling, or things your parents talk about?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: It was just incidents.</span> <span id="s184">That’s all.</span> <span id="s185">With contemporaries, non-Jewish contemporaries.</span> <span id="s186">We used to run into it in playing sports.</span> <span id="s187">I played all the sports at school, and we used to run into it, comments that were made because we were so Jewish-dominated as far as the players, and so we ran into it quite a bit playing sports, and you just ran into it every once in a while, and defended yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: Physically, or verbally?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: Both.</span> <span id="s190">We were kind of tough kids growing up.</span> <span id="s191">It’s kind of interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: Which high school did you say you went to?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: Marshall.</span> <span id="s194">Marshall was a junior high, then went to a high school, then went back to a junior high.</span> <span id="s195">It was a high school from 1940 through 1946, or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: Do you have any feelings about Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s198">I have lots of feelings about Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: You want to tell me about them?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: I don’t like them.</span> <span id="s201">I have a very difficult time with them.</span> <span id="s202">I have a German client, from Hamburg, and he’s a young man, middle, late 30’s, and he’s very bright and he’s very nice.</span> <span id="s203">He’s been very good, he’s been a very good client.</span> <span id="s204">I have some difficulty in dealing with him, but that’s my problem.</span> <span id="s205">And I try to be more rational about it, in that he’s a different generation.</span> <span id="s206">He’s a very interesting guy because his father -- he comes from a very wealthy family -- his father is in the grain business, and his father apparently has, and had a lot of Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s207">So he told me stories of how his father used to tell his Jewish friends to get out, and how his father goes to Israel, and sees some of his friends, and apparently, they also own some hotels in Israel.</span> <span id="s208">It’s a very wealthy family.</span> <span id="s209">I have difficulty with him, but that’s my problem, not because of him, you know, because he’s a very nice guy.</span> <span id="s210">But I don’t like him.</span> <span id="s211">I mean, I don’t like German people.</span> <span id="s212">I dislike them, as a matter of fact, mainly because of being Jewish and knowing what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: Do you ever reflect on how they could have done what they did?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: Well, it’s impossible to understand, except it can happen, obviously.</span> <span id="s215">You get some stories --as a matter of fact my German client told me about basically what was going on in Germany and that the Jews really put Hitler in power.</span> <span id="s216">The voting choices were such that they voted for him, and the Jews were landowners, real estate owners, landlords, and so forth, and Germany was in a depression, so it was ripe for hostility against the Jews, who were probably upper class, upper middle class economically.</span> <span id="s217">But I don’t know how those things happen.</span> <span id="s218">I think most people chose to ignore it, or were afraid to do anything about it.</span> <span id="s219">I think people are basically pretty much the same wherever you go, you know; that’s the scary part about it, because it did happen there, and people did ignore it, and they had their own problems at the time.</span> <span id="s220">The Germans were in a depression, and there was a war going on, and how can anybody explain it?</span> <span id="s221">You can’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: If you could visualize giving that kind of power over you to those kids in high school who were calling you names.</span> <span id="s223">If they had the power to do what they wanted.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: Yeah, sure it could happen.</span> <span id="s225">There’s still plenty of it out there now.</span> <span id="s226">Of course, we’re now more subtle.</span> <span id="s227">Hopefully the world is more civilized.</span> <span id="s228">I don’t really think it is, because there are areas of the world where they kill people like crazy.</span> <span id="s229">Life is cheap, but it’s not cheap to us.</span> <span id="s230">So I don’t understand it, and at this point it’s not my job to understand it.</span> <span id="s231">I deal with it, but I can’t spend a lot of time on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: I thank you for sharing your thoughts and your feelings with us.</span> <span id="s233">Thank you.</span></p>
