antisemitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">HA: In school, a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">JF: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">HA: Oh, they used to call me a dirty Jew, dirty Jew, and they used to call me, they sang songs about the Jews, they used to fight with us because we were always the smartest in the class, I don't know why, I wouldn't say that because it was me, but, as a whole, the Jewish boys in the class were the better students.</span> <span id="s107">We had students in the class, all these students who were Polacks, who barely could read, whereas we were always the first in the class.</span> <span id="s108">So there was jealousy always among us, always fights between us.</span> <span id="s109">But we wouldn't let ourselves.</span> <span id="s110">If I got a hit from a Pole, I give it back, which means it wasn't so bad.</span> <span id="s111">Of course, the authorities would never stand up for us, only against us.</span> <span id="s112">I remember there was an occasion in the school, we were working before Christmas, we had some handiwork to turn in to the teacher, and I was working all evening to make some Christmas decorations for school, so I brought it in, and I worked very hard and very nice, and I brought it in, and since I was the first one in the class, Altschuler, so I was the first one.</span> <span id="s113">He called me in and he looked at the thing, and he said, "Ah, it's nothing."</span> <span id="s114">He gave me a 3, which means he gave me--it was “adequate” which made me really mad.</span> <span id="s115">I went back to the class, and right behind me was sitting a boy who was a friend of mine.</span> <span id="s116">He was living right near my house, and he says, "Henry, I have forgotten my work to turn in.</span> <span id="s117">Will you give me your work and I will turn it in instead of my work?”</span> <span id="s118">So I said, “Surely, Ashua.”</span></p> <p><span id="s119">JF: This was a Polish...</span></p> <p><span id="s120">HA: Polish, oh yes, Karikula was his name, he was actually in the middle of the class.</span> <span id="s121">There were about eighty students in the class.</span> <span id="s122">So after forty people, he gave it to the teacher, and the teacher said, "Oh, it's very nice."</span> <span id="s123">He gave him an A.</span> <span id="s124">It shows you--this was our teacher.</span> <span id="s125">He was a lieutenant in the army, and it shows you what was the character of the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">JF: Now this boy was your friend, and he was a Pole.</span> <span id="s127">There were times, then, that you had friends who were non-Jewish.</span> <span id="s128">Did your parents also associate with non-Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">HA: Yes, quite a few.</span> <span id="s130">Quite a few, because we were living in the part of the town which was completely non-Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">JF: Was that a problem?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">HA: No, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s133">We lived there, this was it, and there were a few Jewish families who were living in this part of the town, and were living there and it was ok.</span> <span id="s134">So-- my brother also my brother was in high school, it was Gymnasium.</span> <span id="s135">Gymnasium was paid, you had to pay for Gymnasium, but my brother was free from tuition.</span> <span id="s136">He didn't have to pay any tuition, because he was a very good student.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">JF: This was a Polish...</span></p> <p><span id="s138">HA: Polish school, Gymnasium.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">JF: Was there any problem in Jewish children going to the Gymnasium?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">HA: There was a quota.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">JF: There was a quota?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">HA: Definitely.</span> <span id="s143">So he went to Gymnasium and he didn’t have to pay anything, but in the 8th class of the Gymnasium because he went to the old Gymnasium because after 1936 we went only six years to Gymnasium.</span> <span id="s144">This was it.</span> <span id="s145">My brother went four years to grammar school and eight years to Gymnasium.</span> <span id="s146">So I remember the eighth grade of Gymnasium, he went to a burlesque show.</span> <span id="s147">He was caught by the professor; he was missing from school.</span> <span id="s148">So my mother went, and she was humiliated, of course, by the director and things like that, and finally, he was let in the school, but he had to pay tuition.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">JF: Were there any other instances that you can recall of antisemitic treatment of your family, or of the Jews in general in your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">HA: Oh, there were pogroms in our town.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">JF: That you recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">HA: Yes, but we wouldn't let them.</span> <span id="s153">When we had a pogrom in the town, all the Jewish boys, there was a nice group of Jewish boys, there were over 5000 Jews in our city, all the young Jewish boys stood in the doors of the houses, and stood steadfast, and they wouldn't let them.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">JF: Who were carrying out the pogroms?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">HA: The peasants from the villages and some of the lower elements of the, and usually, the people who were in the universities, they used to come from the universities and carry out the pogroms.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">JF: Along with the peasants?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">HA: Yes...</span></p> <p><span id="s158">JF: Or was this a separate group?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">HA: Yes, together with the peasants, because they were too weak by themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">JF: But the Jewish youths, the young men, fought back?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">HA: Sure, we fought them back.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">JF: How often would something like that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">HA: It usually happened during the Christmas vacation.</span> <span id="s164">This was a time when the Jews were selling a lot of fish, for example, to the gentiles.</span> <span id="s165">Because it was a Jewish trade, fish, the fishmarket.</span> <span id="s166">So they would bring their own fish they would sell their own fish, and they would make a lot of trouble, but we had our own tricks, the Jews.</span> <span id="s167">For example, we had these big containers of fish, carp, for sale, and we had a few of these guys, these thieves, known thieves in the town, Poles.</span> <span id="s168">They would do anything for a dollar, they would do anything for a zloty.</span> <span id="s169">We gave him a zloty, and he went to look for the fish, for example, and we had poisoned this, and we poisoned all the fish.</span> <span id="s170">They didn't have anything to sell.</span> <span id="s171">This was [unclear] we fought back this way.</span> <span id="s172">We wouldn't let ourselves--for example, they used to go before the synagogue, when the Jews used to come in the evening, from the prayer, my grandfather--they used to tear the beards out, and they used to beat him up.</span> <span id="s173">I remember I was in high school that time, and there was a group of students in the high school who were playing in the orchestra with me and they all disappeared towards evening, and I was wondering, why they disappeared.</span> <span id="s174">They had something to play or something to do.</span> <span id="s175">And I found out.</span> <span id="s176">They used to go fight the Jews.</span> <span id="s177">So we took care of them, too.</span> <span id="s178">One evening there was a son of a [unclear].</span> <span id="s179">He was a thief, a known thief, a Jewish thief.</span> <span id="s180">We paid him some money.</span> <span id="s181">He got a few of his friends, and they used, they went ahead with knife, and they really knocked the shit, excuse me, the shit out of these Endeks, these academians.</span> <span id="s182">He cut off an ear, [unclear].</span> <span id="s183">This was... [unclear]</span></p> <p><span id="s184">JF: Did they get in trouble with the police for that?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">HA: Who?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">JF: The Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">HA: No.</span> <span id="s188">Because the police was on our side.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">JF: The Polish police were on the Jews' side?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">HA: Sort of, sort of.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">JF: Why do you think that was?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">HA: Because, number one, they were paid by the Jews; the Jews were paying them.</span> <span id="s193">They were on our payroll.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">JF: They were on your payroll because of the section of the city that they were working in, or this was extra money?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">HA: This was extra money.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">JF: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">HA: For example, my father knew all the police, because my father was a special--he used to, for example, when somebody stole some jewelry, there was a big theft of jewelry, of diamonds, and my father used to go and look at it.</span> <span id="s198">He was sort of evaluating, an official evaluator, so he knew all the police, everybody, and they used to come to our store.</span> <span id="s199">Everyday, there was some of the police at our store.</span> <span id="s200">They knew my father very well.</span> <span id="s201">As far as the police, there was nothing to worry about, and they knew, and from the police there was nothing.</span> <span id="s202">But, by and large, the people from the army, the people who used to go to schools and the universities, used to come home, these were the people who used to make all this big business about the Jews...</span></p> <p><span id="s203">JF: The people in the army and the students at the universities were primarily the people...</span></p> <p><span id="s204">HA: ...were antisemitic.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">JF:

going east toward the Russian border.</span> <span id="s290">You couldn't walk nights, you couldn't walk by days because the Germans used their air force, used to strafe the roads and everything, so

stealing bread.</span> <span id="s320">My father said, "Look, what kind of army is this?"</span> <span id="s321">They were schleppers, they were nothing.</span> <span id="s322">So my brother had a watch, he sold his watch.</span> <span id="s323">He got a lot of money for his watch.</span> <span id="s324">He thought he got a lot of money.</span> <span id="s325">He could have sold it later on for ten times as much.</span> <span id="s326">But this was nothing, this was a small thing.</span> <span id="s327">So we started to go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">JF: You started to go west again?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">HA: Back west again, yes.</span> <span id="s330">There was a time when we found ourselves in a land of no occupation.</span> <span id="s331">There were no Germans and no Poles, no Russians, just for about half an hour, and the Russians came and we were going, we bought a pair of horses, and a wagon, we started to go back home.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">JF: Were you in any way stopped by the Ukrainians that you mentioned before?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">HA: No, no, they didn't do anything to us.</span> <span id="s334">We were traveling better during the day.</span> <span id="s335">There were a lot of people who were killed by the Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s336">And, finally, we came close to our town.</span> <span id="s337">Our town was like that, you see, Jaroslaw was at the river San, and San was the demarcation line between the Russian occupation and the German occupation, so the city was German, and right after the river were the Russians.</span> <span id="s338">We came to the river and met some people from our city.</span> <span id="s339">They said, "Where are you going?"</span> <span id="s340">"We're going home to see my mother."</span> <span id="s341">"Your mother, your mother is here some place, you better find her."</span></p> <p><span id="s342">JF: This was on the other side of the river?</span></p> <p><span

id="s346">"Don't you know about it?</span> <span id="s347">Your mother was thrown out of the city with everybody.”</span> <span id="s348">So, finally, I found my mother, I found my aunt and my cousin,

members?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">HA: Yes, and my mother stayed in the city.</span> <span id="s354">So, finally, I found them, and my mother said her mother died in the city.</span> <span id="s355">She has to go back to the city to bury her.</span> <span id="s356">So I went with her.</span> <span id="s357">She got a permission from the Germans to return to the city, but I couldn't get, permission, I swam the river, walked three miles ahead on the side, because I knew the river very well.</span> <span id="s358">I swam through the river and entered the city, but I didn't make it to the funeral.</span> <span id="s359">The cemetery was about seven miles from the city, seven kilometers from the city.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">JF: The Germans permitted the Jews to bury their dead?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">HA: Yes, they did.</span> <span id="s362">Especially if there was a German in the city, a Volksdeutsch, which means he was of German origin.</span> <span id="s363">His parents were very good friends with my mother and my father.</span> <span id="s364">His brother was a very good friend of my brother; they used to go both to school together, and my brother was a good student.</span> <span id="s365">He was also a good student, so they were good friends.</span> <span id="s366">The parents we met always during school visitations and similar things, so she went to him, and said, "Mr. Schmidt, would you permit a burial?"</span> <span id="s367">He let her stay in the city.</span> <span id="s368">So she buried her mother.</span> <span id="s369">I was walking.</span> <span id="s370">I went to the house and took everything what I could from my father's tools, cause this was his livelihood.</span> <span id="s371">I brought it over the river and to the Russian zone.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">JF: You swam back with the tools?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">HA: No, I came with a pair of horses, somebody brought me to the river, and the Germans said “Was there a search?”</span> <span id="s374">I said, "Yes, I was searched," and I went to a boat, because the bridge was destroyed, I went with a boat to the other side and my brother was there, and some other people helped me out.</span> <span id="s375">And my mother stayed in the city.</span> <span id="s376">She was actually mad at me; “Why did I carry these things of my father?”</span> <span id="s377">She thought she would be able to bring everything, because she had my grandfather there.</span> <span id="s378">Her father, he was a sick man, he stayed in the city.</span> <span id="s379">So, the next day I came to the river again.</span> <span id="s380">The Germans wouldn't let anybody in and anybody out.</span> <span id="s381">They told us, the Germans, that the only Jews will come out to Seniawa, [Sieniawa] it was twenty miles up the river; another little town, Seniawa, it’s S-E-N-I-A-W-A.</span> <span id="s382">So I went over there with my cousin to Seniawa.</span> <span id="s383">The Russians were on this side, and the Germans were on the other side, and I saw what happened there.</span> <span id="s384">My mother came with my grandfather, and they searched my mother's clothes, everything else, they took some clothes away, they took my violin away.</span> <span id="s385">She had my violin, and they let her go.</span> <span id="s386">She came down, and it was already dusk.</span> <span id="s387">We couldn't travel anymore because it was three kilometers into the city, so we stayed all night on the bank of the river.</span> <span id="s388">The next morning, it was bandits, it was the Ukrainian bandits, the next morning these men started to take everything, everything away from everyone.</span> <span id="s389">My mother was a very strong woman.</span> <span id="s390">She wouldn't let them, and she got knifed, a knife into her hand, and, finally, we got into the town and they took away practically half of whatever we had.</span> <span id="s391">So we stayed there about a day, and we left to this little town, a little village near Jaroslaw on the other side of it, and we went from there to Lubaczow.</span></p>

id="s402">We were not as smart as some people, some people said, "We want to go back to America."</span> <span id="s403">Some people said, "We want to go back to Germany."</span> <span id="s404">All these people who said they want to go back to Germany were deported to Siberia.</span> <span id="s405">Maybe this was better, because maybe they survived.</span> <span id="s406">You see?</span></p>

the morning to the latrine again, because they didn't want us to soil the clothes.</span> <span id="s1170">We went to the hole, because they didn't have a [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">JF:

<span id="s1198">"Do you want to work?"</span> <span id="s1199">I said, "Jawohl."</span> <span id="s1200">So he said, "Give him some clothes and some shoes and let him go to work."</span></p> <p><span

you work at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">HA: It was luck.</span> <span id="s1213">So I said to myself, "Boy, if he lets me live, I will have to escape from this camp, if it's the last

the reason he let us go, he had potatoes in the camp, and in Poland they store potatoes over the winter, because they didn't have storage places, they stored them outside.</span> <span id="s1220">It looked like that, see, they put them into-- [he is drawing a picture; long pause] just like that, a triangle, you see.</span> <span id="s1221">It was covered with straw, and this soil.</span></p>

id="s1224">He had a lot of people to feed.</span> <span id="s1225">He had a lot of soldiers to feed, because he had flak artillery in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">JF: Flak artillery...</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">HA: Yes, anti-aircraft artillery, so they had to be given to eat, so he needed the Jews to make it good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">JF: So this is how
