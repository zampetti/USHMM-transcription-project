Okay.</span> <span id="s42">I just want to do one thing.</span> <span id="s43">I'm afraid my alarm on my watch is going to go off, so let me try to figure out how to make it go off.</span> <span id="s44">I don't know.</span> <span id="s45">I'm going to put it outside.</span> <span id="s46">Why don't you cut for a second.</span> <span id="s47">Now I want you to tell me about Warsaw after the war broke out and where you and your family lived and about what you remember of the forming of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s48">Tell me a little bit about before you were deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A.</span> <span id="s50">We lived all our lives on Miller Street.</span> <span id="s51">This is the Miller Street where the headquarters for the resistance were on Miller 18.</span> <span id="s52">We lived on Miller 38.</span> <span id="s53">We never moved, so we were lucky in that respect.</span> <span id="s54">Before the war, my father had a factory of wooden hand‑carved objects, like carved chairs and carved boxes, decorative plates, and things like that.</span> <span id="s55">In the ghetto, my father applied to the Germans to have a permit for a workshop, and he received a permit to make wooden frames.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">01:06:06 He received the location just across the street from where we lived, an empty apartment.</span> <span id="s57">And one day, he told my sister and me to go over to that location and put the frames in to make it look occupied.</span> <span id="s58">The reason for this permit, as you know, was that anybody who was not employed was subject to transport and anybody that had any kind of a piece of paper could, quote, postpone the transport, and this was the reason for it.</span> <span id="s59">So my sister and I, loaded with this wooden frames, go across the street to put the things in.</span> <span id="s60">And all of a sudden, there is a blockade.</span> <span id="s61">Blockade means that the German, Polish and Jewish police block off, cordoned off a street.</span> <span id="s62">There are whistles, there are screams, there are yelling.</span> <span id="s63">This means that everybody that is going to be caught is going to be transported out.</span> <span id="s64">My sister and I are in this empty apartment, there is screaming and yelling and whistling.</span> <span id="s65">So we run from this apartment, down the stairs.</span> <span id="s66">We want to go into a bunker.</span> <span id="s67">A bunker is a hiding place that each house had to try and hide and wait out and maybe be saved.</span> <span id="s68">We run there with all the other people, but we were strangers in this building, they didn't know us, so they wouldn't let us in.</span> <span id="s69">My sister and I went back upstairs to this apartment, I believe it was on the first or second story, completely empty.</span> <span id="s70">We sit on the floor and we wait, see what's going to happen.</span> <span id="s71">And there are screams and yelling on the street and people crying.</span> <span id="s72">There are shots, a great deal of noise, and screaming "raus, raus, raus," which means out, out, out, everybody out.</span> <span id="s73">And we sit on the floor and we tell each other jokes just to keep our spirits up and to give each other courage.</span> <span id="s74">All of a sudden, we hear heavy steps on the stairs, boom, boom, boom, "raus, raus, raus."</span> <span id="s75">And somebody, with the butt of a rifle, opens the door.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">01:09:01 And it so happens that we were sitting behind the door.</span> <span id="s77">We didn't even know that.</span> <span id="s78">The door is open, a soldier's head comes in, he sees the empty apartment, goes out, goes up, goes down.</span> <span id="s79">And we are there.</span> <span id="s80">And I don't know how long we sat there, until everything was quiet.</span> <span id="s81">And we waited, and we peeked through the windows and there was nobody there.</span> <span id="s82">We made it downstairs.</span> <span id="s83">The doors to the bunker was open.</span> <span id="s84">There was nobody there.</span> <span id="s85">We felt as the last inhabitants on earth, the two of us.</span> <span id="s86">We run across the street where my mother was.</span> <span id="s87">We had the keys, we opened the door.</span> <span id="s88">She was there.</span> <span id="s89">She survived.</span> <span id="s90">She didn't hear.</span> <span id="s91">After that, there was no point of having this workshop.</span> <span id="s92">This was in July '42, as you know, that the big, big transports from Warsaw were taken to Treblinka, to death.</span> <span id="s93">My father, again, there was no room for the workshop, but still you needed some kind of a piece of paper.</span> <span id="s94">My father registered as a woodcarver and he received a job.</span> <span id="s95">His job wasthis was in the time of Stalingrad.</span> <span id="s96">The Germans have experienced great many losses in the battle of Stalingrad.</span> <span id="s97">They brought the wounded to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s98">And those that died were buried there in the German military cemetery.</span> <span id="s99">My father's job was to carve the names, the ranks and the date of birth and death of the fallen soldiers.</span> <span id="s100">This way, he was commuting, with a piece of paper, in and out of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s101">It took, those were, quote, the commandos that were working outside of ghetto.</span> <span id="s102">It was, for us, very nice because my father was able to bring a little bit of food from outside, which was very, very nice, which we didn't have before.</span> <span id="s103">I need simply very quickly to tell you that my older sister Saba (ph) had a fiance who was a Polish officer.</span> <span id="s104">And he run away from Poland, as a Polish officer, not only as a Jew, but as a Polish officer, and she went with him.</span> <span id="s105">They went east at the beginning of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">01:12:01 And this is how she was saved.</span> <span id="s107">So we were left, my father, my mother, my sister Esther and I.</span> <span id="s108">So going back to the story, Esther at that time joined the nursing school and she was working in the Jewish hospital.</span> <span id="s109">So here we have my father, who is working outside of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s110">My mother was keeping house.</span> <span id="s111">I belonged to Shomeratzayir (ph), which is a youth organization, depending on who you speak with.</span> <span id="s112">It's rather to the left, but it is not like some people say Communist now.</span> <span id="s113">It was very socialist.</span> <span id="s114">And in the ghetto, we were having our Hebrew names, we were singing Hebrew songs, we were dreaming of Zionism and free Palestine and emigrating to Palestine, and, of course, as you know, we were part of the Warsaw uprising.</span> <span id="s115">In the ghetto, you have a generation gap.</span> <span id="s116">The older people, who had families, were very much preoccupied with the safety of those dependent on them.</span> <span id="s117">As young people, we had nothing to worry about except our lives and, you know, when you are young, your life doesn't mean very much.</span> <span id="s118">I will never forget, at the beginning of the ghetto, in about '40, '41, two young men came from Vilna, two Jewish men.</span> <span id="s119">It was the first time that all the different youth organizations, Jewish youth organizations, got together under the same roof in spite of the political differences of the spectrum, right to left, or those what have you.</span> <span id="s120">We gathered together in the big synagogue on Tomaska (ph) Street.</span> <span id="s121">It was one of the largest synagogues in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s122">And these two young men told us about the atrocities perpetrated on youth in Vilna in east of Poland, about the murders.</span> <span id="s123">I believed that this is when the seeds for the uprising started, right at that particular point.</span> <span id="s124">When we got up to sing that Hazakna (ph), that Hebrew Shomeratzayir hymn that we will be strong.</span> <span id="s125">And all of us stood up to sing it, the walls of the synagogue trembled, there was that strength.</span> <span id="s126">But when I came home and told my father, "that I don't want to hear this propaganda.</span> <span id="s127">The transports are going for work.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">01:15:03 I don't want to hear those kind of things.</span> <span id="s129">Don't worry your mother."</span> <span id="s130">So then we have the generation gap from the older generation to the younger generation.</span> <span id="s131">To go back to the story, though, my father was working on the other side, coming back every day.</span> <span id="s132">And I was spending my days with Shomeratzayir.</span> <span id="s133">One of my functions was to teach Polish to the many Jewish children who did not have Polish education.</span> <span id="s134">They were versed in Yiddish, but not in Polish.</span> <span id="s135">So this was my job, to help them, you know, improve their spelling and reading skills, one of my jobs.</span> <span id="s136">Another of the jobs was to put the posters on the walls at night to raise the ghetto to arms, that type of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q.</span> <span id="s138">How dangerous was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A.</span> <span id="s140">It was very dangerous.</span> <span id="s141">First of all, there was a curfew.</span> <span id="s142">You know, we couldn't do it before the curfew.</span> <span id="s143">And if anybody was caught after the curfew, they were shot on the spot, no questions asked.</span> <span id="s144">And my father was very unhappy when I used to come home after curfew.</span> <span id="s145">It was at night, the twowe were going in pairs, you know, one with a, with a, big wet brush, you know, put the glue on, and the other putting the poster, and running, you know, from wall to wall to wall to wall.</span> <span id="s146">This was very, very dangerous, no question about it.</span> <span id="s147">For us it was a lark.</span> <span id="s148">But it was not.</span> <span id="s149">By the way, at that point, I must have been 13.</span> <span id="s150">This was about that frame.</span> <span id="s151">I was born in '28.</span> <span id="s152">I was 11 when the war broke out in '39, about 13 in '41, '42.</span> <span id="s153">Anyway, one day we got a call from Umschlagplatz.</span> <span id="s154">Umschlagplatz is the place where the Jews were gathered, waiting for the cattle cars to take them to the camps.</span> <span id="s155">That my father was caught.</span> <span id="s156">As he was coming back from work, paper or no paper, he was taken, and the whole commando was taken immediately to the Umschlagplatz.</span> <span id="s157">My father's boss was a German Wehrmacht captain, Hauptmann (ph) in German, I believe it is a captain in English.</span> <span id="s158">We gave him a call and we told him, look, my father was called to Umschlagplatz.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">01:18:03 I wish I could remember his name.</span> <span id="s160">I don't.</span> <span id="s161">He took his car and came to Umschlagplatz and told the young SS man: "Look, this man is working for me, I want him out now."</span> <span id="s162">And this young officer told him: "Look, I am not taking orders from you."</span> <span id="s163">He said: "I am a captain and you are a private."</span> <span id="s164">He said: "I don't care, my orders have to be in writing from the SS quarters."</span> <span id="s165">So the Hauptmann said: "Look"to us"tomorrow morning, first thing in the morning, I'm going to be back here with the proper paper.</span> <span id="s166">I will take your father out."</span> <span id="s167">What he didn't know that tomorrow would be too late because at that time the trains were going every night.</span> <span id="s168">Lo and behold, my father escaped from Umschlagplatz, I don't know how.</span> <span id="s169">The following day, he goes back to work.</span> <span id="s170">And he tells the Hauptmann: "Look, I have a wife and two daughters.</span> <span id="s171">You are here a group of soldiers, you are here in this building, surely they need some services performed on them, cleaning, laundry, cooking, whatever, why don't you take my wife and two daughters and they will help you here and we will all be here together."</span> <span id="s172">"Sure."</span> <span id="s173">Hauptmann says "That is no problem.</span> <span id="s174">But you have to arrange your papers through the arbeitsdienst," which was the ghetto Jewish equivalent of work exchange, you know, they were in charge of organizing the proper papers and what have you.</span> <span id="s175">So when my father went there, they thought my goodness, if this Hauptmann can save a family of four, surely he can accommodate more of us.</span> <span id="s176">They got in touch with him.</span> <span id="s177">And sure enough, he took 30 people and located them in this German barracks which were located in what used to be a Polish public school.</span> <span id="s178">The Polish public schools in Warsaw were all the same, you know, the buildings were built by the samein the same type of architecture.</span> <span id="s179">So the soldiers were in the whole building, and they gave us the quarters in thenot the cellular, but just the ... mezzanine, kind of.</span> <span id="s180">It was called partair (ph) in Poland.</span> <span id="s181">It was just beforethe ground floor, okay, this is where we were, 30 people.</span> <span id="s182">We were all there working as Jews on the Aryan side.</span> <span id="s183">All, that is, except my sister Esther, for whom there was no room.</span> <span id="s184">So she stayed in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s185">Because she stayed in the ghetto, I got a pass to commute between the ghetto and the Aryan side, and I was going once a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">01:21:10 And I was still in Shomeratzayir, so I was able to come to bring some food for them, not much, whatever, share between my sister and between them, and I was still active in Shomeratzayir.</span> <span id="s187">Until one day, it was one of the most painful experiences for me, it seems so insignificant now but I still think about it, I was told by the Shomeratzayir people that because of security reasons, they can't afford guests, I have to make up my mind, either I am with them or I am not.</span> <span id="s188">So I had to decide to stay with Shomeratzayir and to leave my deaf parents alone.</span> <span id="s189">I couldn't do that.</span> <span id="s190">So I elected, of course, to go back to my parents.</span> <span id="s191">It was too late anyway.</span> <span id="s192">At that particular time, the hell broke loose.</span> <span id="s193">The Warsaw uprising was in full swing.</span> <span id="s194">My sister was across the street and I was in this little post.</span> <span id="s195">There were maybe four of us.</span> <span id="s196">There was one rifle.</span> <span id="s197">And my superior in Shomeratzayir, his name Shimmon Heller (ph), was with us.</span> <span id="s198">There were sniper shots all over.</span> <span id="s199">We didn't have radios.</span> <span id="s200">Our communicators were runners, young boys mostly, who were running from post to post to keep contact.</span> <span id="s201">One of the runners was running and Shimmon saw him down the street.</span> <span id="s202">He was shot and he was wounded.</span> <span id="s203">So Shimmon run to bring him back and he was killed right then and there.</span> <span id="s204">Another runner came through and said listen, guys, everything is over, each one for himself, finished.</span> <span id="s205">I want you to know that in Shomeratzayir we got orders not to be caught alive, that no matter what happens, we are not going to go on the trains alive.</span> <span id="s206">Those were the orders.</span> <span id="s207">This was the spirit of the uprising.</span> <span id="s208">So this runner said to me: "Look, we're going to run and we are going to run out."</span> <span id="s209">I said: "Okay.</span> <span id="s210">Come with me, my sister is across the street in our apartment."</span></p> <p><span id="s211">01:24:01 So we run to our apartment.</span> <span id="s212">On the third floor of this restored buildingat that point, the Germans were methodically blowing up and putting fires to every single building in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s213">In our apartmentthe building two away from us was burning.</span> <span id="s214">Our apartment was so hot, it was so smoky that we couldn't possibly stay there.</span> <span id="s215">The buildings in Warsaw were built in such a way that you had front of the building facing the street and each building had a square courtyard that you reach through the gate inside.</span> <span id="s216">And the whole life in Warsaw really took part in the courtyard rather than on the front.</span> <span id="s217">At that time, in our courtyard, there were the SS men, the Latvians.</span> <span id="s218">In the courtyard, they were with the rifle, with their rifles, screaming "raus, raus, raus," and shooting.</span> <span id="s219">And the smoke was so dense that you couldn't see.</span> <span id="s220">And people were jumping from all the windows right into the ground.</span> <span id="s221">There was no other way out.</span> <span id="s222">But because of the smoke, they couldn't see.</span> <span id="s223">My sister, the runner and I jumped from the third floor down into the asphalt‑covered courtyard.</span> <span id="s224">We scraped our knees and elbows, nothing else.</span> <span id="s225">We kept on running, right through them.</span> <span id="s226">This runner knew the bunkers ways, the other ways, the little passages.</span> <span id="s227">And we were running through the burning ruins of the ghetto, through the part where the buildings used to stand but weren't standing anymore, into the sewers.</span> <span id="s228">And we can smell the gas chasing us.</span> <span id="s229">And we ran out into the alley inside and to go to our parents.</span> <span id="s230">... My parents</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q.</span> <span id="s232">When was that exactly?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A.</span> <span id="s234">This was possible ... '43, April.</span> <span id="s235">April 1943, this is where the, the whole battle with the Germans was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">01:27:05 We stayed with our parents until May 5th, 1943.</span> <span id="s237">We were surrounded by the Germans and taken to Umschlagplatz and then we walked through the ruins.</span> <span id="s238">There wasn't one building left erect.</span> <span id="s239">The smell is indescribable.</span> <span id="s240">It is the smell of rubber, noxious.</span> <span id="s241">And now, if I ever smelled the smell of burning bodiesand it was dark when we were walking.</span> <span id="s242">It had to be in the evening.</span> <span id="s243">And the ruins of the ghetto made it in mountain‑like sights, and you could see on the top, people, single people, like rats, putting their head up, disappearing, looking at us, darting from one burning hole to another, like specters.</span> <span id="s244">We were, the 30 of us, taken to the Umschlagplatz, a sea of humanity.</span> <span id="s245">Everybody sitting and everybody clutching whatever possessions they packed on the way.</span> <span id="s246">We knew we didn't.</span> <span id="s247">Everybody had whatever precious things they had with them, a change of clothing.</span> <span id="s248">If anybody had any valuables.</span> <span id="s249">Every child had a knapsack, valise, things wrapped around in a sheet, with four corners tied in a knot, whatever people had, baskets, what have you.</span> <span id="s250">You walk into the room, there were people sitting all around.</span> <span id="s251">The same thing, the same building that used to be the public school building before the war, Umschlagplatz was the same kind of building.</span> <span id="s252">Floors and floors, we were in one room.</span> <span id="s253">The Germans used to come in, call out the pretty girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">01:30:05 Esther, she went.</span> <span id="s255">She came back, she didn't say a word.</span> <span id="s256">I don't know what happened.</span> <span id="s257">And then, came the time that we were marched out to the cattle trains.</span> <span id="s258">You have a cattle train in the Washington museum.</span> <span id="s259">I never really knew what the dimensions were.</span> <span id="s260">Nobody could tell me.</span> <span id="s261">It's about three‑quarters size of the regular tour bus.</span> <span id="s262">There were 170 people packed into this cattle car.</span> <span id="s263">At first, some people wanted to prevent the panic, to tell people look, people, organize, stand up, there is no room for everybody to sit, we take turns.</span> <span id="s264">There are two small little windows, we'll make turns, everybody will have a little bit of air.</span> <span id="s265">But it didn't work.</span> <span id="s266">People were in a panic.</span> <span id="s267">The young and strong were standing at the windows, blocking whatever air there was for the rest.</span> <span id="s268">My sister and I bodily had to fight the people from trampling over my mother, who was sitting in the corner.</span> <span id="s269">And my father got gray altogether completely.</span> <span id="s270">I don't know how long this trip took.</span> <span id="s271">I have no idea.</span> <span id="s272">It wasn't the lack of food or the toilet facility, it was the lack of water.</span> <span id="s273">There are always experts in any situations.</span> <span id="s274">Apparently we came to the fork of the road and someone said we are not going to Treblinka, we are saved, we are going to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s275">This was the better of the two alternatives.</span> <span id="s276">There was a sigh of relief.</span> <span id="s277">No, we're not going to Treblinka, we're going to Majdanek, excuse me, to Majdanek, not to Treblinka, to Majdanek, that's the better of the two alternatives.</span> <span id="s278">We arrived in Majdanek.</span> <span id="s279">And where in Warsaw they have stairs that you can get up on, in Majdanek, they didn't.</span> <span id="s280">And it was very high from the train from the ground, and you had to jump.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">01:33:01 A meter, three feet, it was high, maybe more, don't know.</span> <span id="s282">It was raining when we arrived.</span> <span id="s283">So I bent down to scoop the mud to quench my thirst and I got a crop over my back.</span> <span id="s284">And the soldiers were lined up on the road, screaming and yelling "raus, raus, raus," with the dogs on the leashes, straining on the leashes.</span> <span id="s285">From our wagon, there were 170 of us.</span> <span id="s286">We left half of the people dead.</span> <span id="s287">And others were mad.</span> <span id="s288">There was a woman whose child was killed and she was running naked and she didn't know what was going on.</span> <span id="s289">And we had to run.</span> <span id="s290">I lost my sister, I lost my father.</span> <span id="s291">I'm running with my mother.</span> <span id="s292">And we are running through an obstacle course of all the precious possessions that people had thrown on the way, they couldn't carry it anymore.</span> <span id="s293">And I threw my knapsack off, I couldn't, it was too heavy.</span> <span id="s294">My mother was stumbling, she ran with hers.</span> <span id="s295">And we run.</span> <span id="s296">And there was a young man, an SS officer standing on the side.</span> <span id="s297">And he beckons me to go to him.</span> <span id="s298">So I leave my mother and I go to him.</span> <span id="s299">And he points with his finger you go over there.</span> <span id="s300">And I want to go back to get my mother.</span> <span id="s301">And he says: "No, no.</span> <span id="s302">She goes there and you go there."</span> <span id="s303">And I did.</span> <span id="s304">And this was the last time I saw my mother.</span> <span id="s305">My father was separated from us when they separated men from women.</span> <span id="s306">And I find myself in an room with many young women.</span> <span id="s307">We are told to undress.</span> <span id="s308">And I found my sister there.</span> <span id="s309">And this was Majdanek.</span> <span id="s310">So we were told to undress and leave everything behind us except our shoes, we could take our own shoes, which we did.</span> <span id="s311">We went through the showers.</span> <span id="s312">We were given some clothes.</span> <span id="s313">And we were marched into the barracks.</span> <span id="s314">And on the way, there were Czech prisoners, non‑Jewish, and we asked them: "Where are our parents?"</span> <span id="s315">And they said: "Don't worry, you are young and strong, you will work here.</span> <span id="s316">Your parents are in different camps, where the work is lighter."</span> <span id="s317">And we believed them.</span> <span id="s318">They were kind.</span> <span id="s319">We come into the barracks, these were wooden barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">01:36:02 We slept on the floor.</span> <span id="s321">There was nothing there.</span> <span id="s322">One of our job was to wash this floors, the wooden floors.</span> <span id="s323">They smelled good, the new, brand‑new, brand‑new wood, smelled good.</span> <span id="s324">In the morning, we volunteered for the work outside the camp, hoping maybe we will find the other camps, maybe we will find our parents.</span> <span id="s325">Many years after the war, I was looking at people's eyes, looking, maybe, never found them.</span> <span id="s326">This was Majdanek.</span> <span id="s327">We were there for a few months.</span> <span id="s328">It was May that we arrived.</span> <span id="s329">We're there until September.</span> <span id="s330">In September, we were transferred to Birkenau.</span> <span id="s331">In Birkenau, our hair was shaved off.</span> <span id="s332">We got tattooed numbers on our left arms.</span> <span id="s333">We were given Russian prisoner of war's uniforms to wear.</span> <span id="s334">There was a Russian prisoner of war camp before we came there.</span> <span id="s335">I don't know what happened to them, but we got their uniforms to wear for a while.</span> <span id="s336">We were in what was called the quarantine.</span> <span id="s337">It was a horrible place.</span> <span id="s338">It was a square, small square of sand, where people sat and waited, I don't know for what.</span> <span id="s339">There were Greek girls who couldn't take the climate, they suffered from malaria.</span> <span id="s340">And everybody was sitting there, looking for each other for lice, looking through the cloth, cleaning each other.</span> <span id="s341">There was no human reaction there, we were just sitting, cleaning themselves, without any strength to move, no reason to get up, unless chased, just sitting, just waiting, just dying.</span> <span id="s342">We were still fresh, we're okay.</span> <span id="s343">Across from us at that time was the men's lager.</span> <span id="s344">And we could see one day there was a selection of the men, which means that the men stood in rows naked and were filed before the Germans to be moved, to be destroyed.</span> <span id="s345">At that point, I was 14.</span> <span id="s346">For the first time in my life that I saw a naked man.</span> <span id="s347">It was indecent, but the implication of what the selection was all about didn't hit me at that time, you know, younger men, older men, different type of work.</span> <span id="s348">We were told that the men lager is going to be moved and that we, from the Birkenau Lager A, are going to move to Birkenau Lager B, where the men used to be.</span> <span id="s349">Sure enough, somebody whispered to us: Say that you are metallurgist, say that you are metallurgist.</span> <span id="s350">Okay.</span> <span id="s351">Here comes the arbeitsdienst, this is an SS woman, asking us professions, what are we, say metallurgist, say metallurgist, that's fine.</span> <span id="s352">We go, we go into the salman (ph), which was a shower room, a communal shower room.</span> <span id="s353">There had to be at least 50 shower heads, you know, 50 different women taking shower altogether.</span> <span id="s354">And different shapes and sizes, different stages of composition, decomposition, you know.</span> <span id="s355">Some young and beautiful and some, you know, it was again this kind of an intimacy that we weren't used to.</span> <span id="s356">But, the water was warm for the first time, I understand, in Birkenau.</span> <span id="s357">Until that time, there was only cold water.</span> <span id="s358">And we got decent clothes.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">01:42:02 By decent clothes, I mean the striped uniforms, which were made out of recycled paper fibers, you know, they were very sharp and scratchy, and you had to be awfully careful.</span> <span id="s360">Because we were emaciated, and if you got a scabies or any kind of a scratch on your body, it was dangerous for you.</span> <span id="s361">But anyway, they would go in the shower and we go, we are placed in a block.</span> <span id="s362">And we are placed in what was called the union commando, which we understood was a factory that produced bicycles.</span> <span id="s363">Eventually, we found that this was ammunition factory.</span> <span id="s364">Anyway, in Lager B, we got to meet friends.</span> <span id="s365">There was a group of us, I wish I remembered their names, but I don't.</span> <span id="s366">But I believe that Hetta Folkes (ph) is one of them.</span> <span id="s367">Hetta Folkes is in this little booklet that we had compiled for the ceremony of unveiling of the monument for the four girls.</span> <span id="s368">So that the eyewitness reports from union, from Auschwitz, Hetta Folkes is one of them.</span> <span id="s369">And we used to meet in the evenings, and the same thing that was in the ghetto happened here.</span> <span id="s370">We were spiritually transported from the reality of the camp into the dreaming of Palestine, of freedom, of getting out, exchanging stories.</span> <span id="s371">So that the reality of the camp really didn't touch us, and our dream quality touched us more.</span> <span id="s372">And there was no peril, because we were living for the evenings, we would get together, when all this will become unreality, when our reality will become the reality.</span> <span id="s373">It was just wonderful.</span> <span id="s374">I think that Victor Frankl, in his book, says, you know, in search of the meaning, if you have the meaning, no matter where you are, you transcend yourself over the situation.</span> <span id="s375">Sometimes in real life we call it schizophrenia.</span> <span id="s376">There, it was our salvation.</span> <span id="s377">When the reality becomes too painful, obviously it may have different ways of expressing itself.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">01:45:05 We have the support of each other, the reality didn't matter.</span> <span id="s379">In this particular club, it was mostly Jewish, but we had one Yugoslavian girl, again whose name I don't remember, who was not Jewish, who was part of this group.</span> <span id="s380">She apparently had contact with the underground.</span> <span id="s381">And she was our newspaper.</span> <span id="s382">She was our journalist.</span> <span id="s383">She was bringing us rumors and things from the outside as she knew them.</span> <span id="s384">And we are talking each one about our experiences and telling stories.</span> <span id="s385">And they didn't know about Warsaw ghettos.</span> <span id="s386">And we told them, you know, Warsaw ghetto rose, they come, we fought.</span> <span id="s387">And they laughed.</span> <span id="s388">They said that there were smarter people than you here and nobody did anything.</span> <span id="s389">And we said well, we are not going to the crematorium alive.</span> <span id="s390">If somebody will drag us, then we take somebody with us or they will have to kill us, we are not going.</span> <span id="s391">And it caught fire.</span> <span id="s392">They can't bodily drag us every single one, we're not going.</span> <span id="s393">It gave us courage.</span> <span id="s394">In those evenings, somebody said, you know, the rumors are coming, the Russians are coming, the Russians are coming near.</span> <span id="s395">The PPR, which is the Polish workers party, the underground Polish worker party, is planning to storm Auschwitz from the outside when the Russians will be here.</span> <span id="s396">And there is underground in the camp who is going to raise from the inside so that we will revolt when the Russians come.</span> <span id="s397">Fine.</span> <span id="s398">This was in 1944.</span> <span id="s399">In the summer 1944, I believe, Hungarian transport came to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s400">From where we were, we saw thousands and thousands of people marching just across the barbed wire, the electrical wire.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">01:48:04 There were four crematoriums in Birkenau.</span> <span id="s402">They were burning day and night, smoke and fire belching out.</span> <span id="s403">But our soup in the camp was better.</span> <span id="s404">Because whatever food was gathered from the transport was thrown into the soup, so we had pieces of biscuits that we hadn't before.</span> <span id="s405">By periodical selections in Birkenau, whenever there were transports, they used to weed out the camp population, those that could no longer work separated from those that could.</span> <span id="s406">We were linedno.</span> <span id="s407">We were on one side, tetrush (ph) prisoners of the administration created a cordon on the other side.</span> <span id="s408">We had orders to undress completely and go over in front of the selecting officers.</span> <span id="s409">And told to go left or right; left to life, right to death.</span> <span id="s410">And the one selection day, I was rotten from the waist down, infection, boils.</span> <span id="s411">The combination of poor diet, poor hygiene, what have you, just developed in boils.</span> <span id="s412">I wasn't going to undress.</span> <span id="s413">If I do, it's a death warrant.</span> <span id="s414">I decided I'm going to undress on top but not at the bottom.</span> <span id="s415">I tried to go once and was pushed back, undress.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">01:51:04 I didn't.</span> <span id="s417">I went again, I was certain I was going to death, I was passed to right.</span> <span id="s418">This was it, we passed the selection.</span> <span id="s419">And this was at the same time because whatever manpower that was depleted by selection was replaced by the new people from the transport.</span> <span id="s420">It was a supply and demand situation.</span> <span id="s421">At the time, when we heard about the preparation for the revolt, we were thinking what can we do, what are we going to do.</span> <span id="s422">We secured the keys to the shed where the agricultural supplies were kept, hoes, rakes, things like this.</span> <span id="s423">We remember from history lessons that in 1862, in the resurrection in Poland, the farmers fought armed with the rakes and hoes, they made a difference.</span> <span id="s424">And we were going to make the difference too, we had the keys, we were prepared.</span> <span id="s425">And then, as we were working in the union, and my sister was working in a place which was called pulver room, where the gunpowder was kept.</span> <span id="s426">Okay, we have gunpowder, we can use it.</span> <span id="s427">My sister was appalled.</span> <span id="s428">She said nothing doing, it's sheer madness.</span> <span id="s429">Hey, let's try it.</span> <span id="s430">What could happen?</span> <span id="s431">We're not going to come out alive anyway, what the heck, right?</span> <span id="s432">I have here the map of the interior of the union.</span> <span id="s433">We decided we are going to try it out.</span> <span id="s434">Where we worked in the factory, there were little metal boxes to keep not the garbage but the debris, you know, from work, you know, that something that was spoiled, a piece of material, what have you.</span> <span id="s435">So you kept in your metal box that was about, oh, I would say, what, about six inches high, 12 inches long, six inches wide, just about, and we used to put them in the boxes and periodically throw them in the garbage bins that were situated at the corners of the big halls.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">01:54:08 So, you know, we are going to try something out.</span> <span id="s437">I said take one box, go around from my place to where she worked, give her an empty box and she would give me a box with garbage, take the box, throw the contents into the bin, come back into my place.</span> <span id="s438">Within several times, nothing happened, nobody paid any attention.</span> <span id="s439">See, we can do it.</span> <span id="s440">We can do it.</span> <span id="s441">We perfected it.</span> <span id="s442">Stacking those two boxes, one on top of the other.</span> <span id="s443">She will take the gunpowder from the pulver room, put in little pieces of material with a little string, throw it in the garbage.</span> <span id="s444">I would come in, take this box, with another garbage box on top, go into my place, take the powder out, stuff it in my dress.</span> <span id="s445">And our guard, we had a system of communication, you needed permission to go to the toilet.</span> <span id="s446">But when you say I am going to the toilet, you make sure you come there at the same time.</span> <span id="s447">And we used to divide this in the toilet and take it with us and pray.</span> <span id="s448">It was three and a half kilometers between unionwithin Auschwitz and Birkenau, and union factory was just next door to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s449">We used to carry it and sometimes we used to have searches.</span> <span id="s450">So when they were looking for contraband, if anybody had parcels, food parcels, what have you.</span> <span id="s451">We always made sure that we were not in the first five rows.</span> <span id="s452">There were, I believe, 1,000 of us in the rows of five, okay.</span> <span id="s453">I can't figure it out how many rows there were.</span> <span id="s454">But we always tried to make a row of five, the same five, and make sure we are in the middle, not the beginning, not the end, so that if something happens, we will know ahead of time.</span> <span id="s455">We used to take this gunpowder, take the cord off behind our backs, throw it on the ground and rub it with our feet.</span> <span id="s456">It would rub in with the dirt because the gun powder are granules, grayish, and they blended in.</span> <span id="s457">And we were never caught.</span> <span id="s458">If it was dangerous, it was.</span> <span id="s459">You can imagine.</span> <span id="s460">Nothing happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q. Let's stop.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A. Good.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">End of Tape 1.</span> <span id="s464">01:57:20</span></p> <p><span id="s465">02:00:04</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Tape 2</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q.</span> <span id="s468">Why don't youlet's just describe a typical day of work.</span> <span id="s469">Once you were assigned to anything, tell me what time you got up and then what happened, and tell me about a day of work.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A.</span> <span id="s471">We used towe were very privileged working in the union.</span> <span id="s472">It was considered a very good commando in terms of relative good or bad in the camp situation.</span> <span id="s473">It was good because working in the union, we were no longer subject to selections.</span> <span id="s474">This in itself was very important.</span> <span id="s475">We were woken in the middle of the night, when it was still dark.</span> <span id="s476">I couldn't tell you the hour, 4:00, 5:00.</span> <span id="s477">We all had to look good.</span> <span id="s478">We knew that we had to look good, so we used to have our dresses folded properly under the mattresses so that when we get up in the morning, they were nice and didn't look crumpled.</span> <span id="s479">We had wooden shoes that had to be spic and span.</span> <span id="s480">During the morning, we used to get what we callwhat was called chi (ph), which is a kind of a herbal tea that they used to make from the weeds that were growing around there.</span> <span id="s481">It was warm.</span> <span id="s482">It wasn't drinkable, but we drank it.</span> <span id="s483">But most of all, we used to wash ourselves with it, and polish our shoes.</span> <span id="s484">It was impossible to go to the communal washroom at that time because people were fighting at the door to get in.</span> <span id="s485">And every building had a responsible person, which was called the kapo.</span> <span id="s486">A kapo was responsible.</span> <span id="s487">So you had a washroom kapo, you had a commando kapo, whatever.</span> <span id="s488">If you were good friends with her or something, she would let you in first.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">02:03:01 If not, she will just beat you up to go back in the line.</span> <span id="s490">So we simply didn't even bother.</span> <span id="s491">We used the chi, this tea, to get washed with and to drink with.</span> <span id="s492">Then, we were to stand up in the lines of five outside for a roll call.</span> <span id="s493">It was called appell.</span> <span id="s494">It was terrible because Birkenau is built on a plane and, for some reason, it's always very, very windy.</span> <span id="s495">And you didn't want to be exposed to the wind and the cold, because your feet and your hands, your extremity in particular, used to freeze just from standing and just from the cold.</span> <span id="s496">We had to stand there for hours.</span> <span id="s497">While before the SS people came to count us, we could still huddle each other, you know, and cover each other and warm each other up.</span> <span id="s498">But when they used to come, then we had to stand straight.</span> <span id="s499">And then we were checked for proper attire and the clean shoes and what have you.</span> <span id="s500">So you went through different checks.</span> <span id="s501">The blockaltester, which was responsible for our block, the barrack where we lived, was the first one to make sure that she won't be punished because one of us was notit was like a military kind of an operation, you know.</span> <span id="s502">And then the SS woman that was counting us waswould look at us, going through the rows and look.</span> <span id="s503">We used to stand there for hours and hours and hours.</span> <span id="s504">We used to take our wooden shoes off because they would scrape our feet.</span> <span id="s505">And if it scraped your feet, you would get a blister.</span> <span id="s506">And when you got a blister, you were subject for selection.</span> <span id="s507">You know, it wasyou really had to take good care of yourself.</span> <span id="s508">I remember at one point we threw out our mattresses, and we used to sleep on the wood, because the mattresses were full of lice and lice had disease, and soanyway, so we used to be there on the roll call.</span> <span id="s509">After the roll call, we usedI believe that we hadeach commando had a different color of kerchief.</span> <span id="s510">We all had kerchiefs.</span> <span id="s511">I believe that ours were white, but I'm not sure.</span> <span id="s512">So we looked, quote, smart, you know, always the same kind of dresses, with the wooden shoes, with the white kerchief, that we were marching left and right and left and right.</span> <span id="s513">And as you know, we had an orchestra.</span> <span id="s514">And the orchestra was playing near the gate where we were walking out.</span> <span id="s515">The SS men watching us with dogs.</span> <span id="s516">But those dogs were quiet for the union commando, you know, it was okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">02:06:05 And then we walked the three and a half kilometers from Birkenau to union, which was short distance from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s518">But there's three and a half kilometers between Auschwitz and Birkenau, so I estimate, you know, maybe the most three and a half, four kilometers.</span> <span id="s519">It is not very long, but when you are tired and when you already stood for a few hours outside and you are cold, you had to really start working your feet and your legs to march from thethey were falling asleep and they were cold, before you started to walk.</span> <span id="s520">It was a long walk for us then.</span> <span id="s521">Then we used to go five by five, each one, to her particular spot in the factory.</span> <span id="s522">There was a large corridor as you walked in, very large.</span> <span id="s523">I would say that it would take aboutwe were in the rows of five, it would easily take another row of five, you know, we took half the width of the corridor.</span> <span id="s524">We used to go, and on our right there wasI forget the term, but this is when they had the dispensary of the tools, so we used to pass that.</span> <span id="s525">It was separated from the corridor with chicken wire fence, kind of.</span> <span id="s526">On the right‑hand side, you had the offices, you had the toilets, you had the showers, you had the storage rooms.</span> <span id="s527">And my particular post was just on the left, just across from the big, big, presses.</span> <span id="s528">They were gigantic, huge, what were called Kuntztof (ph) presses that manufactured the parts that went into the final product.</span> <span id="s529">I still don't know exactly what it is that they manufactured, something, you know, in terms of armament, but I don't know exactly what.</span> <span id="s530">So the presses were, as you walked on the left‑hand side, our tables were on the right‑hand side.</span> <span id="s531">Behind our bags was a glass partition from the second department.</span> <span id="s532">And I remember when I first came in, I thought, you know, they are so inefficient.</span> <span id="s533">There was a space between this glass wall and our stools and the tables.</span> <span id="s534">I said well, why didn't they put it all the way back?</span> <span id="s535">And then I realized that they didn't so that they would have room to go behind our backs and check what we are doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">02:09:04 I was working in some kind of a control.</span> <span id="s537">We had little pieces that looked like checkers.</span> <span id="s538">They were called einsatz schtuker (ph), whatever that means.</span> <span id="s539">And we were sitting in a row, there were about eight girls at our table, each one had in front of her a precision instrument that was checking for the perfection of this checkered piece.</span> <span id="s540">It had many indentations, and each instrument was geared to check a particular indentation, so to work past from hand to hand to hand.</span> <span id="s541">And whatever wasn't good, we used to throw into thisthese boxes, you know, it was the awful garbage, or what have you.</span> <span id="s542">We had a kapo.</span> <span id="s543">A kapo is responsible, it is an overseer.</span> <span id="s544">She was a German prisoner.</span> <span id="s545">Her name was Alma (ph).</span> <span id="s546">She was a very funny kind of a character.</span> <span id="s547">She could be very nice and she could be very sadistic.</span> <span id="s548">She was rather obese.</span> <span id="s549">And she was short of breath.</span> <span id="s550">And she had a particular mannerism of going, with the corner of mouth (indicating).</span> <span id="s551">Everybody, you know, mimicked her.</span> <span id="s552">She was easy to mimic as a caricature of the person.</span> <span id="s553">She used to check our belongings and what have you, whether we had an extra piece of bread.</span> <span id="s554">She liked to have bribes.</span> <span id="s555">I wasn't a particularly good customer, I didn't have anything to give her, so.</span> <span id="s556">But she had a boyfriend, and this was very, very important because when she and her boyfriend were busy talking, I was free to get up and walk and she wouldn't pay attention to me, so I blessed this boyfriend every day of my life in the camp.</span> <span id="s557">We were working there from, I don't know, I would imagine from about 7:00 o'clock in the morning till lunchtime.</span> <span id="s558">At lunchtime, we had a lunch break where we were given lunch.</span> <span id="s559">And this was also a blessing in disguise.</span> <span id="s560">You need to know the reality of the camp life.</span> <span id="s561">It has many parallels to any life anywhere.</span> <span id="s562">For example, we used to get our lunch in big drum kettles.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">02:12:00 Now, in the camp, those that were responsible of ladling out the soup that we used to get at lunchtime, could, or could not, mix the soup.</span> <span id="s564">Now, if they choose not to, we would get the water, and what was left at the bottom was for them.</span> <span id="s565">It made a great deal of difference, what they got, what we got.</span> <span id="s566">In the morning, we used to get with our chiwe were supposed to get a quarter of a loaf of bread, which was very heavy and very small.</span> <span id="s567">But those that were in charge of the bread were ingenious.</span> <span id="s568">What they used to do, they used to take a bread, cut it on one side and on the other side, so there was a slice in the middle.</span> <span id="s569">They used to take this slice, put what was left over together.</span> <span id="s570">And what was left over, cut into four.</span> <span id="s571">So that our fourth was actually smaller than what we were entitled to.</span> <span id="s572">And the spare pieces of bread went to those who could.</span> <span id="s573">So this was in the morning.</span> <span id="s574">At lunchtime, when we were in the union, those soup were mixed very well.</span> <span id="s575">So our soup was very good.</span> <span id="s576">We each had a tin red enamel bowel and a spoon.</span> <span id="s577">Heaven help us if we didn't have it.</span> <span id="s578">Because if we didn't have it, we wouldn't get our soup.</span> <span id="s579">So this was the most important item of belongings that we had.</span> <span id="s580">So this was at the lunchtime, the soup, and the soup was good.</span> <span id="s581">After lunchtime, back to the tables until about 5:00 o'clock.</span> <span id="s582">At 5:00 o'clock, we would line in the fifth and go back.</span> <span id="s583">It was uneventful.</span> <span id="s584">Mind you, when we first came inmy job was easy.</span> <span id="s585">Not every department had such an easy job.</span> <span id="s586">The disturbing thing in my department was that when the big presses were working, they spewed a yellow powder from their manufacturing and printing of the material that was being pressed in and out, so the air there was full of this yellow dust.</span> <span id="s587">The presses make terrible noise, a humming kind of noise, up and down and up and down, and they were tremendously heavy.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">02:15:06 That wasthat was a man's job.</span> <span id="s589">And I remember one day there was one German woman that was operating one of this presses and I went over, I tried to lift it.</span> <span id="s590">It was not possible.</span> <span id="s591">So not all the jobs were as physically easy as mine that I did.</span> <span id="s592">So this was my kind of job.</span> <span id="s593">Then at night we used to go back to camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q. Was there an appell at night too?</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A. Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q.</span> <span id="s597">But not</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A. Yes, another appell at night, but not quite as long as it was in the morning, unless there was an escape.</span> <span id="s599">If there was an escape, mostly from the men's lager, the men's camp, there was silence and we would stand there and stand there until released, not necessarily when they found the people or brought them back, mostly they did.</span> <span id="s600">But, you know, when there was an escape, then we would stand for hours.</span> <span id="s601">But if I remember, the coming back home was less long for some reason than in the morning.</span> <span id="s602">In the morning, I don't know why, but they were much longer.</span> <span id="s603">I think maybe it's our blockaltester responsible for the block needed us to get out of the block so that they could clean the barracks and have them ready for inspection when the SS people came to count us over and over again, to make absolutely sure, you know, that everything was okay.</span> <span id="s604">Because if not, they were responsible.</span> <span id="s605">Maybe that was the reason.</span> <span id="s606">I don't know.</span> <span id="s607">But somehow, in my memory, the going back was shorter.</span> <span id="s608">And we were so anxious, you know, to get together and share the news with other people.</span> <span id="s609">Remember the group I was telling you about, just so anxious to be with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q. Now, how long before your group got together and started deciding that you were going to try to do something, whatever it was, how long were you going to work before youhow long were youhow long was it that you were going to work and then you figured out maybe we could smuggle gunpowder?</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A. I couldn't tell you.</span> <span id="s612">I don't remember how long.</span> <span id="s613">I remember that we were meeting for quite a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">02:18:02 And I rememberhow long could it be?</span> <span id="s615">We were meeting for quite a while and were quite a well‑knit group.</span> <span id="s616">And I don't remember at particularly what point we got the news that the Russians are coming.</span> <span id="s617">You know, this is where this rumor started, that the Russians are coming.</span> <span id="s618">And remember theI know now what I didn't know then, that the Russians stopped at Warsaw, what was it, for some period of time.</span> <span id="s619">We didn't know that.</span> <span id="s620">We were waiting for them every day to come.</span> <span id="s621">But they didn't, they stopped.</span> <span id="s622">And the partisans from outside never came.</span> <span id="s623">And the war from inside never happened.</span> <span id="s624">But we were preparing for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q.</span> <span id="s626">In many ways, not just with gunpowder, but also the keys to the agricultural shed, tell me more about the keys.</span> <span id="s627">And also, I read at some point that you got some shears or you asked for some shears or something.</span> <span id="s628">Tell me all the little things that wereit sounds to me like your group was coming up with anyjust gathering all sorts of ways that could be used later.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A. That's correct.</span> <span id="s630">The keys for the agricultural shed was another member of our group who worked outside in the fields.</span> <span id="s631">She got it somehow.</span> <span id="s632">I got the insulated shears.</span> <span id="s633">And this was sheer madness.</span> <span id="s634">As I told you, when we were walking in, there was this big corridor.</span> <span id="s635">And on the left‑hand side, there was the tools dispensary, or what have you.</span> <span id="s636">Every time I was walking by there, there was a Yugoslavian man, not a Jew, that always smiled at me, and I smiled in return.</span> <span id="s637">I don't even know his name.</span> <span id="s638">I have no idea who he was.</span> <span id="s639">When we were thinking, you know, of the revolt, I thought to myself look, we need insulated wires to cut through the electrified wires, we need it, where are we going to get it?</span> <span id="s640">And he was working at the tools.</span> <span id="s641">So one day, I said to him hey, listen, I need the insulated wire cutters.</span> <span id="s642">He just looked at me.</span> <span id="s643">And this was it, this was all that was said, nothing more.</span> <span id="s644">I thought what can happen?</span> <span id="s645">One day, he walkedyou know, this was the standard procedure, you know, walking with those boxes, it was the camouflage for being busy and doing something very official.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">02:21:07 You know, you just don't walk, nobody walks, you know, you walk with a purpose, you walk for a reason.</span> <span id="s647">You know, one reason can be to take this box and then throw it into the garbage, right?</span> <span id="s648">Okay.</span> <span id="s649">Lo and behold, one day he came into our department and he put two boxes in front of me.</span> <span id="s650">Alma was busy with the boyfriend, good.</span> <span id="s651">And I just looked at him, took the two boxes, put it under the table.</span> <span id="s652">Goodbye, goodbye.</span> <span id="s653">When I opened the box, underneath, there were bread.</span> <span id="s654">I thought well, very nice.</span> <span id="s655">This was the only present I ever got in the camp from somebody was this whole bread.</span> <span id="s656">I said my goodness, that's great.</span> <span id="s657">We took the bread.</span> <span id="s658">We are working.</span> <span id="s659">I told Estucia (ph), hey, guess what, I have bread, whole bread.</span> <span id="s660">I have to tell you, you know, something aside from theof the human beings, you know, women or men, women in particular, we each one had in the camp what we used to call a boytl (ph).</span> <span id="s661">A boytl is a sack.</span> <span id="s662">This is German for a sack.</span> <span id="s663">It was made from scraps of material, where we kept our possessions, whatever, a piece of string, a toothbrush, if you bought one, your spoon, whatever.</span> <span id="s664">There were searches.</span> <span id="s665">And every time there was a search, we lost our boytls and in no time at all, you had another boytl again.</span> <span id="s666">You know, the human characteristic of gathering things and having some possessions, no matter what, we all had a bag with possessions.</span> <span id="s667">Stupid little things, but they meant everything.</span> <span id="s668">We always had them.</span> <span id="s669">Because we had them, of course the bread went right into it.</span> <span id="s670">We come into the camp and we open this bread, and what do you know, there were the insulated shears there.</span> <span id="s671">I trusted him, and he trusted me.</span> <span id="s672">And I didn't know who he is.</span> <span id="s673">We had it.</span> <span id="s674">Gave it to either Marta or somebody, you know, for hiding, but we had it, giving us a sense of security.</span> <span id="s675">If nothing else, we had a way out.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q.</span> <span id="s677">What other things like that can you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A.</span> <span id="s679">This was about the kind of thing that I remember, other than the spiritual and moral readiness.</span> <span id="s680">You know, this isI believe it's a mind‑set.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">02:24:00 You just tell yourself that you're going to die with dignity or that you are going to survive at any cost.</span> <span id="s682">We kind of knew that we are not going to survive; therefore, we are going to make our deaths count.</span> <span id="s683">This was it.</span> <span id="s684">We were ready.</span> <span id="s685">We were wrong.</span> <span id="s686">We did survive.</span> <span id="s687">We didn't believe it.</span> <span id="s688">You never know in life when you were going to be dead, so might as well do something, make not our life count but our death count.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q. Tell me more about when you approached your sister about getting gunpowder, and sheit sounds like she was reluctant.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A.</span> <span id="s691">She didn't want to.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q. Tell me more about that whole thing.</span> <span id="s693">Tell me about convincing her.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A.</span> <span id="s695">It wasn'tyou know, the one day, came from this group, I said look, we have access to the compound.</span> <span id="s696">She said you are crazy.</span> <span id="s697">Not going to survive, how can we do it?</span> <span id="s698">This is the type of thing, you know, that over a period of time, as I told you, making this dry runs with the boxes, it worked and it progressed.</span> <span id="s699">The tragedy is that she died, that I didn't.</span> <span id="s700">It didn't take very much.</span> <span id="s701">It was the reality of the danger, of course.</span> <span id="s702">She was a few years older, more responsible.</span> <span id="s703">I can't tell you much more than that.</span> <span id="s704">The point is that she agreed.</span> <span id="s705">The point is that she didn't agree because I pressured her, she agreed because she believed in that.</span> <span id="s706">It was ayou know, you have somebody close to you, you discuss things, you get together on that.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q. Now, again describe to me how it worked with the metal boxes and howhow your sister and the others in the gunpowder room managed to steal some of the gunpowder.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">02:27:10</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A. I cannot tell you about the other girls.</span> <span id="s710">I can only tell you about my sister.</span> <span id="s711">My sister was the first through the door.</span> <span id="s712">If you look at the scheduleat the plan of the union factory floor map, you will see that the pulver room, where the girls worked, was at the outer north side of the building.</span> <span id="s713">The door into the pulver room was on the inside.</span> <span id="s714">She would prepare the little packages of gunpowder in the amount of a Ping‑Pong ball, small, in pieces of material with the string that she would put in one box, put the garbage on top of it, put another box on top of it.</span> <span id="s715">I would come in with two empty boxes.</span> <span id="s716">She would give me two boxes with garbage.</span> <span id="s717">I would take these boxes, walk around, come back into my place of work, put the boxes under the table, fish out the little gunpowder, put it inside my dress, call Alma to tell her I want to go to toilet.</span> <span id="s718">When Alma knew I am going to go there, I would make how many trips like this, maybe two a day, or maybe one, you know, and this went through the period of a few months, not too long, really, you know, it was until we were moved to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s719">This was as long as we were in Birkenau.</span> <span id="s720">And in the toilet, Alla (ph) and I would give her mine and then I would have another one.</span> <span id="s721">I would carry it outside.</span> <span id="s722">Does this answer your question?</span> <span id="s723">Can you visualize it?</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q.</span> <span id="s725">When youdid you ever have to sacrifice the gunpowder you were carrying because you were going to be searched?</span></p> <p><span id="s726">02:30:04</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A. Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s728">On several occasions, it happened that we had towe knew that there were searches, you know, it's passed almost like a wave, you hear from the beginning of the line of the commando through the end, search, search, search, so we knew in enough time to just take it out, open it behind us, spread it on thethrow it on the ground and rub it with our feet so it would blend in the ground.</span> <span id="s729">It happened on several occasions.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q.</span> <span id="s731">As it was going on, did you girls ever talk about it together in a group or was it all very secret?</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A.</span> <span id="s733">It was all very secret, very secret.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q. And what did you do with it when you</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A.</span> <span id="s736">In the block, I gave it to Estucia.</span> <span id="s737">Estucia took care of it.</span> <span id="s738">I know from Marta's testimony, Marta Bendeger Sierch (ph), that Estucia used to leave some packages with her.</span> <span id="s739">She never knew what was in it.</span> <span id="s740">I don't know what happened to it, but it was Alla who knew Rosa Rabota (ph), or whether it was Estucia, I don't know.</span> <span id="s741">I gave it to Estucia.</span> <span id="s742">Estucia took care of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q.</span> <span id="s744">So Estucia became very involved in the whole thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A. Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s746">Very much so, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q. And you were free in the union to go in and out of the gunpowder room?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A. No.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q. No.</span> <span id="s750">So how did you get the boxes from her?</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A. Nobody, nobody was allowed to move at all.</span> <span id="s752">I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Q.</span> <span id="s754">So you weren't allowed to and you did?</span></p> <p><span id="s755">A. No, that's right.</span> <span id="s756">You were supposed to sit where you sat and this was it.</span> <span id="s757">You are not allowed to.</span> <span id="s758">You are sittingto the toilet with permission and back.</span> <span id="s759">But I did.</span> <span id="s760">In 1994, I was in Birkenau commemorating the yoma shoa (ph).</span> <span id="s761">I was given the honor of lighting a candle for those who resisted during the war.</span> <span id="s762">After I lit the candle, I went down from the podium and I wanted to be by myself.</span> <span id="s763">I was very nervous.</span> <span id="s764">And as I walk, I hear somebody scream this is her sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">02:33:01 And I recognize a woman and she recognized me, 50 years later, she was one of the women that work in the union.</span> <span id="s766">How did she recognize me?</span> <span id="s767">Because she saw me walking.</span> <span id="s768">And she recognized me 50 years later.</span> <span id="s769">And she told me, you know, I don't understand it, all I knew from union was how to go from the entrance to my seat and from my seat to the toilet and back.</span> <span id="s770">The girls from the pulver room couldn't walk, for sure not, other than to the toilet, she didn't move.</span> <span id="s771">I was the one that was walking with the boxes to her door, give her the boxes, she gave me the boxes, and I was walking back.</span> <span id="s772">She did not move.</span> <span id="s773">What she took out, if she did, was by sitting and going to the toilet, not to me.</span> <span id="s774">So two separate operations.</span> <span id="s775">Who else did what, I don't know.</span> <span id="s776">We did not talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q. Okay.</span> <span id="s778">So at the time, you didn't know where the gunpowder was going?</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A. No, no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Q. No idea.</span> <span id="s781">Although you knew it was going somewhere, or you hoped it was going somewhere.</span> <span id="s782">Did you think at the time there was organized help on the outside that would coordinate with resistance in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s783">A.</span> <span id="s784">This was the rumor.</span> <span id="s785">This was the news that we were given, that when the Russians come, the Polish workers party and the partisans, the Polish partisans from the outside have contact with the organized underground in Auschwitz and there were some from the outside that they give a password to the underground and we will all revolt.</span> <span id="s786">But this was the extent of it, you know, those were unconfirmed rumors.</span> <span id="s787">We did not have any direct contactI didn't have any direct contact with anybody who is, quote, organized underground.</span> <span id="s788">Maybe Estucia did.</span> <span id="s789">I didn't.</span> <span id="s790">I didn'tyou know, we were comforting each other, you know, every day there were new news, you know, that the Americans, they have joined the war, Berlin is bombed, the Russians are here, the Americans are here.</span> <span id="s791">They were bombing.</span> <span id="s792">We heard the planes over.</span> <span id="s793">We were begging for the bombs to fall.</span> <span id="s794">They never did.</span> <span id="s795">It was here now that I saw in the Washington museum the area map of Birkenau that was taken by a U.S. plane.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">02:36:07 You know, there is a writer by the name of Wyman (ph), David Wyman.</span> <span id="s797">He wrote a book called "The Abandonment of the Jews."</span> <span id="s798">And he is saying in this, in his book, that these four girls dared to do what the allied forces did not, to confront the Nazi empire.</span> <span id="s799">I was sidetracked.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q. Well, tell me what you remember when you heard noise in October.</span> <span id="s801">Did you hear the noise of</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A. No.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q.the explosion?</span> <span id="s804">No.</span> <span id="s805">So how did youwhat happened that you remember before your sister got taken away?</span> <span id="s806">How did you know what</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A. I don't remember exactly when the union commando was transferred from Birkenau into luxurious quarters in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s808">We were not in the men's camp.</span> <span id="s809">We were next door to the whorehouse.</span> <span id="s810">I remember, because when we were walking into our new quarters, there were the ladies of the night in Angora sweaters leaning through the windows and cheering us, welcoming us to the camp in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s811">Our blocks were outside of the men's camp.</span> <span id="s812">When I was back in Auschwitz, I was looking for them but they no longer existed, it's very disorienting.</span> <span id="s813">Anyway, we were moved into these quarters.</span> <span id="s814">This was like heaven.</span> <span id="s815">They were brick buildings.</span> <span id="s816">We had beautiful wooden bunk beds.</span> <span id="s817">And there were only two in a bedthree in a bed, but they were large, where we were eight before in that space, we were six.</span> <span id="s818">And the bunk beds were back to back and side to side.</span> <span id="s819">In other words, you had three and three and three and three, and with the head to head, three and three on the other side, right, like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s820">02:39:02 And on the first.</span> <span id="s821">We had showers, hot and cold water in the building, we didn't have to go outside anywhere.</span> <span id="s822">They were beautiful.</span> <span id="s823">They were clean.</span> <span id="s824">They were brand‑new and spotless.</span> <span id="s825">Absolutely gorgeous.</span> <span id="s826">There was a movie theater.</span> <span id="s827">And one day we were forced to go to see a movie.</span> <span id="s828">I don't remember what the movie was.</span> <span id="s829">We were there a short while.</span> <span id="s830">While we were in Auschwitz, and this must have been November that the crematorium blew upOctober, October, so we were already in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s831">In Auschwitz, we've heard that the crematorium was exploded and the sonderkommander watched, but we were already in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s832">The crematorium was in Birkenau.</span> <span id="s833">We didn't hear.</span> <span id="s834">We didn't see.</span> <span id="s835">We were told.</span> <span id="s836">There were girls who worked in Birkenau and lived in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s837">The runners, I don't know who else, so there was communication going on.</span> <span id="s838">We knew that this is what happened, that's all we knew.</span> <span id="s839">After</span></p> <p><span id="s840">Q. Were you still working in the same place?</span></p> <p><span id="s841">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s842">We are working inbut we are no longer smuggling.</span> <span id="s843">The moment we were moved from Birkenau to Auschwitz, the smuggling stopped, finished.</span> <span id="s844">A little while later, ... the four girlsno.</span> <span id="s845">Alla Gardner was caught for some reason.</span> <span id="s846">She was tortured.</span> <span id="s847">And she give up the name of Rosa Rabota (ph), Esther Wajcblum, that's it, the three.</span> <span id="s848">They were taken into block 11, which was in the men's camp, which was the prison, into Birkenau, which had a prison, within the prison, the block 11, they were called the block there.</span> <span id="s849">They were tortured and they were asked to give up the name and people with whom they worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">02:42:00 At the time, it appears that when the revolt in sonderkommando occurred, the Germans found traces of gunpowder on the ground in the little manufacturedhad manufactured little whatever, hand grenade.</span> <span id="s851">I understand they were made out of shoe polish and with a little wickshoe polish boxes, you know, they put the gunpowder, there was a wick.</span> <span id="s852">I'm not exactly sure, this is what I was told.</span> <span id="s853">What we didn't know was that the gunpowder can be identified, it has special characteristic, and they knew that this gunpowder had to come from union and nowhere else.</span> <span id="s854">And only those girls work in the gunpowder, Estucia.</span> <span id="s855">Alla didn't.</span> <span id="s856">I don't know how Alla was caught, what happened with her.</span> <span id="s857">The three of them were tortured terribly.</span> <span id="s858">They came back.</span> <span id="s859">Estucia was raw meat.</span> <span id="s860">While Estucia was in the bunker, I approach somebody who I was told a Belgian Jew, working in these presses, was working in the underground.</span> <span id="s861">And I told him tell me what they are saying so that I will know what to say.</span> <span id="s862">And he said to me get out of here, I don't want anybody seeing you talk to me.</span> <span id="s863">He was afraid.</span> <span id="s864">While they were in the bunker, I was questioned in the office in the union.</span> <span id="s865">Two SS men came, you know, the good cop, bad cop.</span> <span id="s866">One was very threatening.</span> <span id="s867">Our kapo of the union was called Maria.</span> <span id="s868">She was in the office.</span> <span id="s869">The civilian German mastermeister Fernandum (ph) was there too.</span> <span id="s870">Maria started to slap me around and he put a stop to it right away.</span> <span id="s871">Maria, we don't need that.</span> <span id="s872">And these Germans were asking me, tell melook, you might as well tell us everything because your sister confessed.</span> <span id="s873">They looked at me.</span> <span id="s874">She confessed?</span> <span id="s875">What would she confess to?</span> <span id="s876">She is not a liar.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">02:45:00 She has nothing to confess to.</span> <span id="s878">What do you know?</span> <span id="s879">I say I know nothing.</span> <span id="s880">They let me go, just like that, nothing, nothing.</span> <span id="s881">When she came back, we thought this is it, it's finished, thank God.</span> <span id="s882">Okay, she was tortured.</span> <span id="s883">Marta took care of her.</span> <span id="s884">Marta took care of everything, of everybody, always.</span> <span id="s885">We thought this was it.</span> <span id="s886">I know that they were out of the bunker by December 1st because this was my birthday.</span> <span id="s887">And we are celebrating my birthday and her release.</span> <span id="s888">And Marta made a rice pudding for a dessert for us.</span> <span id="s889">I don't know where she got it.</span> <span id="s890">And she put it on the window to cool for later, and we're sitting there and talking and having good time.</span> <span id="s891">Came time for the rice pudding, it was gone.</span> <span id="s892">It just wasn't there, okay.</span> <span id="s893">But I remember this was December 1st.</span> <span id="s894">And thenthe story, by the way, whenyou know, when they were asked by the Germans what did you do, they gave the names of allas their contact people, of all the names of the sonderkommando who we knew were dead.</span> <span id="s895">Why did you do it?</span> <span id="s896">For bread.</span> <span id="s897">Finished.</span> <span id="s898">This was all.</span> <span id="s899">And then they were taken again.</span> <span id="s900">And here we don't know.</span> <span id="s901">One story is that maybe, while they were left out, they were left out, so that they would be watched for the contacts and followed.</span> <span id="s902">Another story says that there was a girl who was caught during one of the searches with a parcel and who said if you leave me aloneshe didn't want to give away the name of the person who gave her the food parcel.</span> <span id="s903">She said if you leave me alone, I will tell you who stole the parcel, and she gave the names.</span> <span id="s904">I don't know.</span> <span id="s905">All we know is that they were taken back.</span> <span id="s906">Regina Shaffelstein (ph) helped in the girls in pulver room, but she did not smuggle.</span> <span id="s907">She was taken because she was responsible of the girls in the pulver room.</span> <span id="s908">Rosa Rabota never worked in the union, she was never in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s909">She was in Birkenau, working in the klidenskamer (ph), which is, you know, sorting out clothes commando.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">02:48:10 She was in the camp for a long time.</span> <span id="s911">She came there before we did.</span> <span id="s912">And she was the one that had the contact with the sonderkommander.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Q. Let's go back.</span> <span id="s914">When the three were taken the first time, in November, Alla, your sister, and not Regina but</span></p> <p><span id="s915">A. I'm not sure whether the three, or maybe Regina too.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">Q. Maybe.</span> <span id="s917">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A. Maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">Q. Okay.</span> <span id="s920">And when they came back, your sister was in very bad shape for a while?</span></p> <p><span id="s921">A. Terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Q. And she gradually got better and then you talked to her about what had happened to her?</span></p> <p><span id="s923">A.</span> <span id="s924">We didn't talk.</span> <span id="s925">There is no need to talk.</span> <span id="s926">I could see.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">Q.</span> <span id="s928">But did you talk to her about what she told them?</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s930">And that's what she said, that they told them that they'd give the names of the sonderkommando, and they did it for bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q.</span> <span id="s932">So she told a story that the sonderkommando said to them get us gunpowder and we'll get them bread?</span></p> <p><span id="s933">A. No, no, she never told me that, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Q. Okay.</span> <span id="s935">Tell me exactly what she told you.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">A.</span> <span id="s937">She toldwe were talking, as far asfirst of all, it was difficult for her to talk, she couldn't talk.</span> <span id="s938">Secondly, she told us that Jakob was wonderful for them.</span> <span id="s939">Jakob Konjanik (ph) was the kapo of the bunker, was just wonderful to them, very helpful in every way, encouraging, probably trying whatever in whatever way he could.</span> <span id="s940">She told us, that she said that the gunpowder was given to the sonderkommando, that they knew that they were all dead.</span> <span id="s941">We knew about their revolt before they were taken to the bunker, so they knew who were dead, and that they didn't say anything else to anybody, which they didn't.</span> <span id="s942">This was it.</span> <span id="s943">We were just happy that she is out and this is all over.</span> <span id="s944">Does this answer your question?</span></p> <p><span id="s945">02:51:02</span></p> <p><span id="s946">Q.</span> <span id="s947">You trust Jacob, the kapo?</span></p> <p><span id="s948">A. Very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">Q. And you knew him before your sister got taken the second time, or she told you about</span></p> <p><span id="s950">A. No, no, no.</span> <span id="s951">Marta.</span> <span id="s952">Marta was working in the post office.</span> <span id="s953">There was a post office in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s954">The Germans, the Germans in particular I believe that, and Christians from other countries as well, were entitled to get parcels.</span> <span id="s955">Marta was working in the post office in the parcel office.</span> <span id="s956">Marta had contact with Jacob.</span> <span id="s957">Marta was the one that kept the communication going between Estucia and me while she was in the bunker.</span> <span id="s958">Marta was the one who heard from Jacob that hewhen he got orders for the execution, that he stayed the execution, that he washe knew, as well as we knew, that the Russians are coming, that the war is ending.</span> <span id="s959">He was praying for time, hoping that the execution will be not only postponed, but will never take place, he was trying very hard.</span> <span id="s960">So he told the commandant that he will not accept his order.</span> <span id="s961">He apparently had that power.</span> <span id="s962">And he was waiting for orders from Berlin.</span> <span id="s963">The orders did come.</span> <span id="s964">I never met him while in Auschwitz; Marta did.</span> <span id="s965">I was supposed to, but it never happened.</span> <span id="s966">But in Israel, when I came to Israel in 1946, he found me and came to visit me to find out how I am doing.</span> <span id="s967">This is the first time that I have met him.</span> <span id="s968">I knew of him from Estucia.</span> <span id="s969">She told us, that is one of the things she told us, how good he was to them, how much he cared, how much he took care of them.</span> <span id="s970">I had never met him.</span> <span id="s971">I only heard ofuntil in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">02:54:02</span></p> <p><span id="s973">Q. Okay.</span> <span id="s974">We don't have a lot left.</span> <span id="s975">I'm going to ask you a couple of other questions.</span> <span id="s976">What about, did your sister have a boyfriend?</span></p> <p><span id="s977">A. Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">Q. Tell me about him or what you know about him.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">A.</span> <span id="s980">What Iokay.</span> <span id="s981">His name was Tadek (ph).</span> <span id="s982">He was Polish, non‑Jew.</span> <span id="s983">He was a kapowe already are familiar with the term "kapo"of some kind of a commando that had something to do with wood.</span> <span id="s984">I don't know whether they were chopping wood, whether they werewhat they did do with the wood.</span> <span id="s985">As I told you before, pulver room was situated on the northern side of the building of the union.</span> <span id="s986">They had a door in the window leading to the outside.</span> <span id="s987">For fresh air, they kept the door open.</span> <span id="s988">Tadek's commando was passing by pulver room every day, morning, probably in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s989">As a kapo, he had a lot of power, he could.</span> <span id="s990">And then his commando was not far from union.</span> <span id="s991">Sometimes we used to get our lunches, not inside but outside.</span> <span id="s992">Some way, I don't know.</span> <span id="s993">Maybe they were allowed to go outside for fresh air, the girls from pulver room.</span> <span id="s994">Somehow Estucia met Tadek and Tadek met Estucia, and they became very, very friendly.</span> <span id="s995">And one day he gave her a food parcel.</span> <span id="s996">And this was so unfortunate that Rose Smith, who worked in pulver room, was caught with the parcel and then she got the beating because of that.</span> <span id="s997">You know, this was Estucia's parcel.</span> <span id="s998">That's all I can tell you about him.</span> <span id="s999">End of Tape 2.</span> <span id="s1000">02:56:12</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">03:00:20</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Tape 3</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">Q.</span> <span id="s1004">Now I want you to tell me what happened when your sister and the others were taken in late December, what youI just want you to start going chronologically from there.</span> <span id="s1005">I know this is difficult, but I want you to tell me what happened as you remember it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">A. I don't know how long it was before they were released from the bunker.</span> <span id="s1007">And we were so ecstatic, believing it's all over, they are free, the investigation produced nothing, they will let them go.</span> <span id="s1008">And all of a sudden, they were taken again.</span> <span id="s1009">And I was beside myself.</span> <span id="s1010">I didn't know what it meant.</span> <span id="s1011">Marta, who was working in the post office in the men's camp, was in touch with Jakob.</span> <span id="s1012">Jakob was so involved with the girls, and with Estucia in particular.</span> <span id="s1013">Estucia was the one who must have told him about Marta.</span> <span id="s1014">And Marta and Jakob were in contact.</span> <span id="s1015">I was losing my mind.</span> <span id="s1016">I was so worried, I just couldn't function anymore.</span> <span id="s1017">I believe that Marta bribed somebody to get me into the hospital, which was called Teraveer (ph) in Auschwitz, and I was there.</span> <span id="s1018">And she was the go‑between, Jakob, Estucia and me.</span> <span id="s1019">Every dayagain, I have more particulars, more details, in the book.</span> <span id="s1020">She was tryingJakob asked that she arrange that I go to see him and Estucia in block 11.</span> <span id="s1021">This was possible from the hospital because this was only a small hospital with a few beds, but for x‑rays and for some more serious things, they had to go to the hospital in themain hospital in the men's camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">03:03:18 This was also a way to, you know, where you could go have contact with men, and what have you.</span> <span id="s1023">And Marta was working very hard to try to get me to go on one of these transportnot transport, you know, this outing to the men's camp, with an excuse that I need to go to the hospital.</span> <span id="s1024">Well, I wasn't functioning very well.</span> <span id="s1025">One morning, I was standing in line to go with this group that was going to the main hospital in the men's camp.</span> <span id="s1026">And this doctor, whose name was Tetmeir (ph), we called her in Polish Tetmeirka (ph).</span> <span id="s1027">So Dr. Tetmeir, I was standing in line and she asked me: "What are you standing here for?"</span> <span id="s1028">And I said: "I have the flu."</span> <span id="s1029">So she said to me: "For the flu, you don't have to go, you go some other time."</span> <span id="s1030">And she took me out of the line.</span> <span id="s1031">So I never got to see Estucia or Jakob, it simply didn't work.</span> <span id="s1032">And then I was getting into more and more depressive state.</span> <span id="s1033">And I remember that one day Marta came and she said to me: "I have a letter to you from Estucia."</span> <span id="s1034">And she brought me a letter from Estucia.</span> <span id="s1035">This was the last communications that I had.</span> <span id="s1036">I don't remember it verbatim now.</span> <span id="s1037">But when I was in Auschwitz in 1993, I met with the officials of the museum, and we introduced each other.</span> <span id="s1038">And I told him who I am.</span> <span id="s1039">And he took me to block 11 and he says to me: "Which cell was she in?"</span> <span id="s1040">I had no idea.</span> <span id="s1041">But, I remember her last letter.</span> <span id="s1042">And from this letter, we could locate which cell she was in.</span> <span id="s1043">Because in this letter, she was saying "I can see the shadow of the legs of the prisoners coming back from work," so the window of her cell must have been facing one of the main road where the people were coming back.</span> <span id="s1044">She said: "Oh, how I miss the familiar sound of appell.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">03:06:03 So terrible then; so missed now.</span> <span id="s1046">How I miss everything.</span> <span id="s1047">Everything is gone.</span> <span id="s1048">And I so much want to live."</span> <span id="s1049">A summary of the last communication that I had.</span> <span id="s1050">So I never saw her.</span> <span id="s1051">Help me with what your question was.</span> <span id="s1052">I strayed away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">Q. No.</span> <span id="s1054">You areyou're telling me what happened after she was taken.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">A. Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s1056">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1057">And I was getting into a deeper and deeper depression.</span> <span id="s1058">And one day Marta came and said to me: "Listen to me.</span> <span id="s1059">We got orders, Jakob got orders from Berlin, the execution is stayed.</span> <span id="s1060">They are going to live."</span> <span id="s1061">One day, I was in hospital.</span> <span id="s1062">Marta came, took me out of the hospital.</span> <span id="s1063">And the union commander was standing in Auschwitz in the appellplatz, it's the roll call platz.</span> <span id="s1064">I saw the girls, but I didn't see them.</span> <span id="s1065">And Sherry and Nellie, Anitzka (ph), all of Marta's friends, grabbed me, took me into the block.</span> <span id="s1066">I knew I didn't know.</span> <span id="s1067">And I didn't know what was going on.</span> <span id="s1068">The last I knew, the execution was stayed.</span> <span id="s1069">And we are in the block and suddenly there was ... the collective scream, and I knew what happened.</span> <span id="s1070">They were hung two by two.</span> <span id="s1071">And this was January 5th, 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">03:09:11 And Auschwitz was evacuated January 18th, 1945.</span> <span id="s1073">Rumors had it that the camp is mined and after we leave, it will be exploded.</span> <span id="s1074">I didn't want to leave.</span> <span id="s1075">I didn't want to go.</span> <span id="s1076">Marta was pulling me bodily.</span> <span id="s1077">I never believed we will survive, but we did.</span> <span id="s1078">But my sister didn't.</span> <span id="s1079">And I will never know what the sacrifice was for.</span> <span id="s1080">The four girls who gave their life for a free world, for a better world.</span> <span id="s1081">I believe that one day it will be a better world, in spite of the evidence to the contrary.</span> <span id="s1082">I believeI have to believe they didn't die in vain, they did it for something.</span> <span id="s1083">I believe that such words as "honor" and "integrity" still have meaning.</span> <span id="s1084">I believe.</span> <span id="s1085">... I'm sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Q. Do you remember the death march?</span> <span id="s1087">Do you remember liberation?</span> <span id="s1088">Or were you so</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">A. I remember, it was January.</span> <span id="s1090">We were escorted by the old Wehrmacht German soldiers, who were so old that they were not fit for the eastern front, and this is why they were appointed to march us through the countryside, deep into Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">03:12:24 I remember it was snowing and the sky was beautiful.</span> <span id="s1092">There were stars in the white snow.</span> <span id="s1093">It was like a fairyland.</span> <span id="s1094">We had to have the soldiers march because we couldn't.</span> <span id="s1095">And we could have run away except there was nowhere to go.</span> <span id="s1096">Where will we go?</span> <span id="s1097">Who is going to help us?</span> <span id="s1098">So we went and we went and we went and we went.</span> <span id="s1099">At night, we would sleep with cows in the barns.</span> <span id="s1100">And we would steal their food, what they called the white and yellow hard vegetable, turnip, used to eat the turnips.</span> <span id="s1101">But no, we couldn't.</span> <span id="s1102">And we walked until weI believe we reached Ravenbruck, the camp in Germany.</span> <span id="s1103">From there, we went by train.</span> <span id="s1104">Oh, it was a different train from the one from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1105">It was cozy.</span> <span id="s1106">It was lovely.</span> <span id="s1107">The doors were open.</span> <span id="s1108">There was straw on the floor.</span> <span id="s1109">We got to the camp called Neustadt‑Glewe, Mecklenburg.</span> <span id="s1110">Iranu Byranese (ph), one of the Jewish girls, died there.</span> <span id="s1111">So the German campers were running to us to ask us what is the proper ritual to bury her?</span> <span id="s1112">We think she should be buried according to her faith.</span> <span id="s1113">We were liberated in Neustadt‑Glewe.</span> <span id="s1114">How did we know?</span> <span id="s1115">There was nobody around us.</span> <span id="s1116">The Germans were gone.</span> <span id="s1117">We were afraid to move, that the camp was being mined, that if we take one step, it is going to explode with us.</span> <span id="s1118">We didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s1119">I was too sick to move, not only because I was depressed, but also because I had my boils and they wereI couldn't move.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">03:15:06 They were sticking to my underwear, with the pus, with theI justI was just too sick to move.</span> <span id="s1121">All of a sudden, the girls started to move.</span> <span id="s1122">Nothing happened.</span> <span id="s1123">So they raided the food supplies.</span> <span id="s1124">They ate by mouthful the milk powder and the egg powder, that's what was there, just by mouthfuls.</span> <span id="s1125">The tragedy was that many of them died of overeating.</span> <span id="s1126">I was too sick to eat.</span> <span id="s1127">I believe that we were liberated by the British and the Russians, they met there, if I am not mistaken.</span> <span id="s1128">I am not sure.</span> <span id="s1129">I was taken to the hospital.</span> <span id="s1130">I was in the hospital.</span> <span id="s1131">I was operated three times for the boils, my backside, and they wanted to operate again.</span> <span id="s1132">I told them I don't want any more.</span> <span id="s1133">When I was in the union, next to me, at the table where I worked, was a Belgian girl by the name of Rosa Tabakmun (ph).</span> <span id="s1134">When you sit and the work is monotonous, you talk.</span> <span id="s1135">What do you think you talk about?</span> <span id="s1136">You talk about food.</span> <span id="s1137">And she was telling me the best ice cream in the world is in Belgium.</span> <span id="s1138">That's good.</span> <span id="s1139">It comes liberation time, repatriation, Marta says she wants to go to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1140">What's the point?</span> <span id="s1141">She wants to find maybe somebody of her family survived.</span> <span id="s1142">I said: "Listen, I don't have to go to Poland, I know that mine didn't.</span> <span id="s1143">You will find your relatives.</span> <span id="s1144">Let's go to Belgium first.</span> <span id="s1145">Let's try the ice cream, then we'll go back."</span> <span id="s1146">So we come to the tables.</span> <span id="s1147">In each table, they have every country, and there is a country for Belgium.</span> <span id="s1148">And I and my perfect friend, high school friend etcetera, she said to him she speak Belgique, so he knew that I looked Belgique.</span> <span id="s1149">And I told him, you know, we have a relative, Rosa Tabakmun, became our firsthand cousin, she lives in Belgium.</span> <span id="s1150">We have nobody in Poland.</span> <span id="s1151">We have nobody in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1152">This is where we want to go.</span> <span id="s1153">Fine.</span> <span id="s1154">So we went to Belgium.</span> <span id="s1155">We had ice cream for breakfast, lunch and supper for a long time.</span> <span id="s1156">This is how we ended up in Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">03:18:01 Marta fell in love and married.</span> <span id="s1158">I lived in Belgium for about a year.</span> <span id="s1159">And by the way, I was, by this time, 16.</span> <span id="s1160">Through the offices of the Jewish organizations, we were sent to a repatriation camp in Artens (ph).</span> <span id="s1161">It was beautiful.</span> <span id="s1162">And in 1945, I wrote a diary, in Polish at that time, blow‑by‑blow description of everything that happened up until the execution time.</span> <span id="s1163">This was July, August 1945.</span> <span id="s1164">I couldn't cope with that.</span> <span id="s1165">I put this diary away for 50 years, never looked at it again.</span> <span id="s1166">But recently I had it translated for my family.</span> <span id="s1167">So there it is.</span> <span id="s1168">The diary is better than my memories.</span> <span id="s1169">There are many things that I don't remember, of course.</span> <span id="s1170">But the diary keeps it for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">Q. I'm going to ask some specific questions.</span> <span id="s1172">First, how many girls worked in the gunpowder room?</span> <span id="s1173">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">A. I always thought it was six.</span> <span id="s1175">I think that Rose Meth, who was born Rose Greenapple, worked in the gunpowder room together with Estucia, she should know better.</span> <span id="s1176">It was six, seven, eight the most.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">Q. Small number?</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">A. Small number.</span> <span id="s1179">I know that they worked on day shift, of course.</span> <span id="s1180">I am not so sure that there was a night shift.</span> <span id="s1181">I knowI don't know.</span> <span id="s1182">I never heard that there were.</span> <span id="s1183">You would think you would hear by now, but I didn't.</span> <span id="s1184">My impression is that it was only during the day shift.</span> <span id="s1185">I may be wrong.</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">Q. And you said the smuggling stopped when you</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">A. Moved.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">Q. Moved from?</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">A. Birkenau to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">Q.</span> <span id="s1191">Why did the smuggling stop at that point?</span> <span id="s1192">Did you know why or do you remember why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">A. I can only assume that whatever preparations we made, remember, for the general revolt, was no longer valid when we were moving into a new location, when we had nothing.</span> <span id="s1194">We did not have the access to theour shears that we had, to the agricultural tools, to nothing.</span> <span id="s1195">We were no longer there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">03:21:00 We were coming into a new place.</span> <span id="s1197">We didn't know where we were going.</span> <span id="s1198">Suddenly, suddenly it was a new reality.</span> <span id="s1199">There was no point, you know, we were too new there to get ourselves oriented to know what we are going to do.</span> <span id="s1200">We were there not a long time.</span> <span id="s1201">And events started progressing very quickly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">Q.</span> <span id="s1203">So there was an element of fear when you moved, maybe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">A. Disorientation.</span> <span id="s1205">Disorientation.</span> <span id="s1206">The sonderkommandothe crematorium blew out when we were in Auschwitz, I believe, meaning that in October, we were already in Auschwitz, I think, yes.</span> <span id="s1207">I'm a little bit confused about the dates.</span> <span id="s1208">But ifif the revolt was, was in October, and we didn't hear it, but Alma told me about it, then we were already in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1209">So it wasn't so much the fear but with this location, there was disorientation.</span> <span id="s1210">You need to be in a place for a while to start functioning.</span> <span id="s1211">Again, this was a new reality, this was something new.</span> <span id="s1212">We know now that this was, what, September, let's say, October, a few months till we were finally evacuated.</span> <span id="s1213">But at that time, this was a new beginning.</span> <span id="s1214">Do you understand what I am saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">Q. Another question.</span> <span id="s1216">Tell me aboutoh, between the time that the girls were first taken in November and questioned and then they were released, when they were released, did they also go back to work?</span> <span id="s1217">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">A. I don't know.</span> <span id="s1219">I don't know about the others.</span> <span id="s1220">Estucia couldn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">Q.</span> <span id="s1222">So she stayed in the block all day?</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">A. Couldn't.</span> <span id="s1224">It was not possible.</span> <span id="s1225">I don'tMarta would know.</span> <span id="s1226">Marta will know exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">Q. Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">A. Marta should be interviewed, if she will let you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">Q.</span> <span id="s1230">In the union, men and women both worked?</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">A. Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">Q. And did the men comewas it about equal numbers?</span> <span id="s1233">Tell me little bit of what you remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">A.</span> <span id="s1235">The men and women were separated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">03:24:06 The men worked in different department, of course, and the women were working in different department.</span> <span id="s1237">I am not sure about the numbers.</span> <span id="s1238">Somehow, my impression is that there were more women than men, but there were quite a lot of men as well.</span> <span id="s1239">So if my estimate is correct, then during the day shift, there were just about a thousand women, I think.</span> <span id="s1240">Because we were in the first 500, and then came the next 500, and it makes a thousand.</span> <span id="s1241">Then there would be probably an equivalent number at night.</span> <span id="s1242">I'm not sure about those numbers, but just approximately.</span> <span id="s1243">Somehow, my feeling is, and this only a feeling, that there were perhaps half the amount of men.</span> <span id="s1244">Because maybe a lot of precision work were made by women, while the more rough work was made by man.</span> <span id="s1245">I don't know.</span> <span id="s1246">There was little communication except for very specific man who have special professions, let's say an electrician or a machinist, you know, that needed to repair something, and suddenly you would see a man here and a man there.</span> <span id="s1247">But most of the time, those were separate.</span> <span id="s1248">Except for the time when the Allied planes, in '44, were flying over Auschwitz, they were bombing, there were sirens of air raid coming up, and the electricity would stop.</span> <span id="s1249">All the German personnel would grab their gas mask and their outfit, and whatever, and run.</span> <span id="s1250">And I never knew where they were running, to what shelters they were running.</span> <span id="s1251">And we, the prisoners, would sit under our tables.</span> <span id="s1252">Our tables were made out of metal, and this was, in a sense, a protection, not if we wanted protection.</span> <span id="s1253">What we desperately wanted was for those planes to please bomb it, finish it, finish it, bomb the production.</span> <span id="s1254">Of course they never did.</span> <span id="s1255">But during the time when the electricity stopped, you suddenly heard the noise the machines were making when the electricity was on.</span> <span id="s1256">There was quiet.</span> <span id="s1257">And in this quiet, the Greek men and women across the factory would join in singing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">03:27:00 And it was the most beautiful sound.</span> <span id="s1259">I don't know Greek, but I remember the word triana (ph), oh, oh, la triana, and this was a harmony and communication in song all across the factory.</span> <span id="s1260">It was one of the most beautiful, beautiful sounds that I remember from union.</span> <span id="s1261">I'm sure all those that were there remember this as well.</span> <span id="s1262">I wonder where they are.</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">Q. Back to stopping the smuggling between when you moved from Birkenau, could it have been that Estucia no longer had her contact to pass the gunpowder on, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">A.</span> <span id="s1265">It could very well be.</span> <span id="s1266">It could very well be that she no longer had her contacts, yes.</span> <span id="s1267">It is quite possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">Q.</span> <span id="s1269">But you don't rememberyou don't remember talking to her about stopping it, or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">A. No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">Q. Another question about her.</span> <span id="s1272">Do you remember, since she was four or five years older than you, did she try to protect you?</span> <span id="s1273">Do you remember?</span> <span id="s1274">Did you know that she might have done that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">A. Well, of course she wanted to protect me.</span> <span id="s1276">If you mean that did I know what she was doing and this way she didn't involve me, I don't think so.</span> <span id="s1277">That she wanted to protect me, yes.</span> <span id="s1278">She wrote to Marta, telling, her please take care of Hanka for me and then I will die in peace.</span> <span id="s1279">In that sense, yes.</span> <span id="s1280">To protect me, no.</span> <span id="s1281">It wasn't so much for protect me as the security was very strict, you know, we all knew one other person, each one of us, not more than that.</span> <span id="s1282">It wasn't so much to protect me when I was involved as is to protect others in terms of security.</span> <span id="s1283">No, I don't think so.</span> <span id="s1284">No question that she was concerned for me, but not in that sense, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">Q. Tell me about those messages to Marta.</span> <span id="s1286">Because that we didn'tyou didn't talk to me about that in depth.</span> <span id="s1287">But those last messages to Marta to take care of you, how did Marta get those messages?</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">A. Marta got those messages from Jakob directly.</span> <span id="s1289">Jakob had a great deal of power.</span> <span id="s1290">He had the freedom of movement.</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">03:30:01 Estucia must have asked him to do that, and he actually delivered written paper.</span> <span id="s1292">He must be the one that provided them with paper and pens or pencils, what have you, to write on.</span> <span id="s1293">He delivered it to Marta.</span> <span id="s1294">Marta delivered it to me.</span> <span id="s1295">The rest were to be through Jakob.</span> <span id="s1296">And as I told you before, I was supposed to meet him.</span> <span id="s1297">He asked for it and, you know, his word was "important" but it never happened.</span> <span id="s1298">But he was the one thatand Marta, that give the messages in paper, in writing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">Q. Were you afraid?</span> <span id="s1300">I mean do you remember being afraid during the whole smuggling thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">A.</span> <span id="s1302">We were terrified.</span> <span id="s1303">We were absolutely terrified.</span> <span id="s1304">We were terrified of the consequences, but not terrified enough not to do it.</span> <span id="s1305">I was terrified every time I was walking with my two boxes under the nose of this glass cubicle where the masterthe director of the factory sat.</span> <span id="s1306">And I was walking just under him and around him.</span> <span id="s1307">Of course I was terrified.</span> <span id="s1308">I was panic‑stricken.</span> <span id="s1309">We were terrified every time we had the gunpowder on us, we were terrified.</span> <span id="s1310">But remember, we didn't believe we would survive.</span> <span id="s1311">We knew why we are doing it.</span> <span id="s1312">Sure, we were terrified.</span> <span id="s1313">We were terrified to die anyway.</span> <span id="s1314">But there is a difference between terrified to suffer and terrified to die for nothing.</span> <span id="s1315">So one overrode the other.</span> <span id="s1316">We were wrong.</span> <span id="s1317">I was wrong.</span> <span id="s1318">We survived.</span> <span id="s1319">We didn't know at that time that there was any possibility of that.</span> <span id="s1320">I was wrong.</span> <span id="s1321">Does this answer your question?</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">Q. Yes.</span> <span id="s1323">Now I want to ask you a couple of questions from things that I read, which you may totally disagree with or not know about, and they may be erroneous.</span> <span id="s1324">Did you know a kapo named Eugene Koch (ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">A. No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">Q. Okay.</span> <span id="s1327">One account that I read, he might be the one who denounced your sister and the others.</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">A.</span> <span id="s1329">How could he?</span> <span id="s1330">How did he know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">03:33:01</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">Q. I don't know.</span> <span id="s1333">I'm asking you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">A. I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">Q. Okay.</span> <span id="s1336">You never heard of him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">A. No.</span> <span id="s1338">I read about that.</span> <span id="s1339">I don't know.</span> <span id="s1340">Just recently.</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">Q. And Ruth, in testimony, once mentioned a Russian girl Clara.</span> <span id="s1342">Did you know about that?</span> <span id="s1343">Do you know her?</span> <span id="s1344">Tell me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">A. It's a rumor.</span> <span id="s1346">It's a story I was told.</span> <span id="s1347">I don't know for sure.</span> <span id="s1348">But at that time, this was the story about the girl.</span> <span id="s1349">And I didn't want to mention her name, that I told you who was caught at the night shift with a parcel.</span> <span id="s1350">And she said if you let me go, I will tell you who was smuggling the parcelthe gunpowder.</span> <span id="s1351">This girl slept with Alla on the same bed.</span> <span id="s1352">She give up Alla.</span> <span id="s1353">This is how Alla was caught.</span> <span id="s1354">And this is how</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">Q. And you think Alla may have given up</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">A. Yeah.</span> <span id="s1357">There is noplease, there is no, not any kind of a criticism here, you know.</span> <span id="s1358">She couldn't help but.</span> <span id="s1359">And to her strength, she only gave three namestwo names, Estucia and Rosa Rabota.</span> <span id="s1360">She didn't give Regina.</span> <span id="s1361">Regina was taken because she was responsible for both of them.</span> <span id="s1362">So Alla gave only two names: Estucia and Rosa Rabota.</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">Q. Do you know for sure that Alla</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">A. That's what I heard.</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">Q.</span> <span id="s1366">You heard that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">A. Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">Q.</span> <span id="s1369">So you don't know for sure?</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">A. I don't know.</span> <span id="s1371">I don't know for sure.</span> <span id="s1372">It makes sense, otherwise how did they found them?</span> <span id="s1373">There's no other explanation.</span> <span id="s1374">I don't know for sure.</span> <span id="s1375">This was the conjecture.</span> <span id="s1376">This is what we understood.</span> <span id="s1377">There is no other way that they could have found those girls.</span> <span id="s1378">Certainly not Rosa Rabota.</span> <span id="s1379">Rosa Rabota had nothing to do with union.</span> <span id="s1380">She was in Birkenau and then Bestideakomen (ph).</span> <span id="s1381">No way.</span> <span id="s1382">They questioned us and they found nothing.</span> <span id="s1383">No way.</span> <span id="s1384">How could they know?</span> <span id="s1385">Not through Karl.</span> <span id="s1386">Through whom?</span> <span id="s1387">Unless this girl had a contact with Clara, and this is what Clara told him, could be.</span> <span id="s1388">My understanding was that it was Alla.</span> <span id="s1389">I don't know how they found out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">Q.</span> <span id="s1391">Why do you think that it was Alla?</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">A. Alla was the first one caught and questioned.</span> <span id="s1393">And that's a fact, that she gave the names of Estucia and Rosa Rabota.</span> <span id="s1394">That's a fact.</span> <span id="s1395">She was the first one caught and tortured.</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">Q.</span> <span id="s1397">So she was taken before</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">A. That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">03:36:02</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">Q.</span> <span id="s1401">But she was held while Esther was also taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">A. Immediately after, they were taken, Esther and Rosa Rabota.</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">Q. Like within a day?</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">A. Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">Q.</span> <span id="s1406">Did you know Rosa?</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">A. I don't remember.</span> <span id="s1408">I don't remember her.</span> <span id="s1409">I may have.</span> <span id="s1410">I don'tI don't remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">Q.</span> <span id="s1412">In one thing I read, it said that Regina did not participate in the smuggling, and in another that she did participate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">A. My impression was that she didn't.</span> <span id="s1414">But she must have known and closed her eyes.</span> <span id="s1415">Rose Metz (ph), who worked in pulver room, is telling me that she did know, that she did help.</span> <span id="s1416">I don't know.</span> <span id="s1417">I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">Q. Do you think thatI guess you didn't know a lot of men in the camps, but how do you think men and women confronted thatdo you have any thoughts about how men and women confronted the situation, either similarly or differently?</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">A.</span> <span id="s1420">In what terms?</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">Q.</span> <span id="s1422">In any terms.</span> <span id="s1423">I don't have a specificI'm interested because you seem to think a lot about such things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">A. I will tell youfirst of all, coming back to your last question, you know, there are only three survivors who really, who are still alive, thank God, who could give more light to this question of who and what.</span> <span id="s1425">It is Marta Bendeger Schiss (ph), who lives in Belgium.</span> <span id="s1426">It is Malla Weinstein Zimmen (ph), who lives in Israel.</span> <span id="s1427">It is Rose Meth, born Greenapple, who lives in Brooklyn, New York.</span> <span id="s1428">Those three women, that I know of, were connected, one way or another, with this whole episode.</span> <span id="s1429">There is one more in Israel by the name of Veret Muron (ph), who was Rosa Rabota's very good friend, who was involved in Rosa's activities outside of the union one who knows her well.</span> <span id="s1430">Those are the four people that perhaps should be asked again the details, who may remember better than I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">03:39:04 They should be.</span> <span id="s1432">Those are the four that I know of.</span> <span id="s1433">Of course, there are historians and other people that write about it, okay.</span> <span id="s1434">Sorry.</span> <span id="s1435">The relationship about men and women, about men and women, you know, ... I don't know why, maybe grass is always greener on the other side, but I always had a feeling that women have a greater capacity for cruelty to each other than men do.</span> <span id="s1436">Men do know how to engage in team sport.</span> <span id="s1437">Women do not.</span> <span id="s1438">I feelI may be terribly wrongthere is a paradox in there.</span> <span id="s1439">I don't believe that anybody could survive alone just for their own sake.</span> <span id="s1440">There was a much greater of moral and physical survival if you were close to somebody, not a whole group of people, but one in particular.</span> <span id="s1441">If you lost your family, you adopted a stranger, who became your family.</span> <span id="s1442">And this, this perhaps, this maternal instinct, or the need to care, that made it important to survive for each other.</span> <span id="s1443">I think that people who felt themselves totally isolated gave up.</span> <span id="s1444">But if you had a close link with somebody, you had a better chance for moral and spiritual survival, and therefore a physical one.</span> <span id="s1445">I think it is almost impossible to survive alone.</span> <span id="s1446">I don't know how men felt about that.</span> <span id="s1447">Maybe they were more in a group.</span> <span id="s1448">We had this group that met together that were dreaming of a better life, and those were the kind of meaningful encounters that thinking people need to have as a stimulus for living, which is a little bit different than on a one‑to‑one caring deeply for each other's survival.</span> <span id="s1449">I remember when my sister had typhus in camp.</span> <span id="s1450">There was a market in Auschwitz, did you know that, in Birkenau?</span> <span id="s1451">The non‑Jews were allowed to get parcels, and the German prisoners for sure.</span> <span id="s1452">And they used to trade these luxuries that they used to get through the parcels for bread or soup or what have you.</span> <span id="s1453">So there was, in between the blocks afterwards.</span> <span id="s1454">And when Estucia was sick with typhus, she couldn't eat, not the soup and not the bread.</span> <span id="s1455">And I used to exchange it for a little bit of sugar, maybe, or an apple, or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">03:42:04 And therefore, I had to give her bread and my bread to get it.</span> <span id="s1457">I didn't feel the hunger.</span> <span id="s1458">And the physical hunger really was not important, but the fact that I am needed to give her something to overcome the typhus was more important.</span> <span id="s1459">And she overcame it, and we went back to the regular routine of our meals, if you have.</span> <span id="s1460">Somehow I feel that this is more important.</span> <span id="s1461">When I was separated from her, and of course the circumstances too, I give up.</span> <span id="s1462">If it wouldn't be for Marta, I wouldn't be here.</span> <span id="s1463">And Marta was very close to us for the same reason, she lost her family.</span> <span id="s1464">And we had affinity to each other, which was very unusual because Marta is from Czechoslovakia and we are from Poland.</span> <span id="s1465">There was a great deal of animosity between the Czechs and the Poles, and the different ethnic groups.</span> <span id="s1466">Because the Czech girls, who were the first that came to camp, were in the position of administration and power.</span> <span id="s1467">They didn't likeyou know, it's the kind of a dynamics that you find in anywhere, about the newcomers, the new kid in the block, the new kid in the class, new immigrants coming to a country, you know, that type of a thing is almost duplicated in the dynamics of the camp situation.</span> <span id="s1468">There was very little love lost between the Czech girls in power and the Polish girls that were Polish.</span> <span id="s1469">But Marta and Estucia and I were kinship spirits, and who love each other to this day.</span> <span id="s1470">And it is, again, my conviction that this kind of caring for each other helps you overcome.</span> <span id="s1471">While when you are alone, I give up.</span> <span id="s1472">Marta took care of me.</span> <span id="s1473">I don't know whether men experience the same type of thing.</span> <span id="s1474">I wouldn't know.</span> <span id="s1475">I know that people desperately, of course, were trying to find, men, women, that came from their own hometown.</span> <span id="s1476">They may not have had anything to do with each other before the war, you know, either socially or academically, or what have you, but just know that if not your family, somebody from your town was there, this became the closest kinship that could be.</span> <span id="s1477">So people were trying to findthere was a Yiddish word, landsman, you know, people coming from the same background.</span> <span id="s1478">People knowing people that you knew became a kind of a kinship relationship.</span> <span id="s1479">I think that in terms of loyalty and solidarity, the situation could have been a little bit better in the men's camp than in the women's.</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">03:45:02 So there were, you know, these two elements, the elements of a great deal of cruelty and sadism and power wielding, rough brutality, and this great love.</span> <span id="s1481">Not so much team playing.</span> <span id="s1482">I don't know how it was in the men's lager.</span> <span id="s1483">It's an interesting question.</span> <span id="s1484">I'm not sure.</span> <span id="s1485">Does this answer your question?</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">Q.</span> <span id="s1487">It does answer my question.</span> <span id="s1488">And now I want you to tell me a little story about registration, when you first came in and got your number.</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">A. Ah, when we first came in Auschwitz, I told you, you know, the first thing was, of course, we were disrobed and then our head was shaven.</span> <span id="s1490">You know, even if you have your bathing cap on and you see yourself without your hair, it just doesn't come close to how your face changes when you have no hair.</span> <span id="s1491">So when our heads were shaven, I was looking for Estucia and she was looking for me and I couldn't recognize her.</span> <span id="s1492">She was standing beside me.</span> <span id="s1493">All I could see was the two big green eyes.</span> <span id="s1494">She had a mass of chestnut color long hair.</span> <span id="s1495">And all of a sudden, all I see is these two big green eyes looking at me and I don't know who it is.</span> <span id="s1496">And it was her.</span> <span id="s1497">She was a dancer before the war.</span> <span id="s1498">She won a scholarship.</span> <span id="s1499">We went to a theater one day, and it was a ballet performance.</span> <span id="s1500">And then the children from the audience, those that wanted, were invited to perform on the podiumon the stage, and she went.</span> <span id="s1501">And she performed a waltz and a chardish (ph), and she got the scholarship.</span> <span id="s1502">And her scholarship was free tuition to a dance school.</span> <span id="s1503">So she moved like a dancer.</span> <span id="s1504">She was very graceful.</span> <span id="s1505">So there she was, you know, thin, tall, willowy, with big green eyes and no hair.</span> <span id="s1506">And then we line up to have our tattoo done.</span> <span id="s1507">And, you know, it's a question of luck.</span> <span id="s1508">Those were other girl prisoners that were given this apparatus to tattoo your number.</span> <span id="s1509">And some werean alphabet they didn't know how to write, and didn't know their numbers, you know.</span> <span id="s1510">And if you struck out, your number would look like somebody who doesn't know how to write.</span> <span id="s1511">If, by the same token, you got somebody who had some writing skills, then your number was, you know, more or less well written.</span> <span id="s1512">Estucia's number waslet me see48149.</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">03:48:04 And my number is 48150.</span> <span id="s1514">And the girl that tattooed my number said to me: "You are going to survive."</span> <span id="s1515">And I looked at her: "How do you mean?"</span> <span id="s1516">She says because the total of your number, four and eight is 13andfour and eight is 12 and one is 13 and five is 18.</span> <span id="s1517">This spells, in Hebrew, chai, which means life.</span> <span id="s1518">The number 18 is a life number in the Jewish culture, if you want.</span> <span id="s1519">And she knew how to write, she obviously had some Jewish background.</span> <span id="s1520">It's a very encouraging kind of thing, you know, to be told in something so terrible, hey, there are good news.</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">Q.</span> <span id="s1522">Now I want to ask you about some of the people that you knew.</span> <span id="s1523">And we don't have a whole lot of time left, so I'm going to ask youI'm not going to ask you to describe your sister first, because we probably should reload.</span> <span id="s1524">But did you know an SS woman known as the frog that Ruth talked about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">A.</span> <span id="s1526">Who is Ruth?</span></p> <p><span id="s1527">Q.

Just a little bit.</span> <span id="s1598">I think we should just do a few more.</span> <span id="s1599">It's better to do it, because you can never tell if you might remember something.</span> <span id="s1600">Put on a half hour roll.</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">A. Are we off?</span> <span id="s1602">End of Tape 3.</span> <span id="s1603">03:55:25</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">04:01:21</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">Tape 4</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">Q. Tell me about your sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">A. Well, what can I tell you?</span> <span id="s1608">As I mentioned before, my parents were deaf.</span> <span id="s1609">There was a four years difference between each one of us.</span> <span id="s1610">In other words, there were four years difference between Saba (ph), my older sister, and Estucia, and four years difference between Estucia and me; therefore, there were eight years difference between Saba and me.</span> <span id="s1611">Because my parents were deaf, they relied heavily on their oldest daughter to be their spokesman sometimes, you know, with the hearing world, negotiating, outside the offices, whatever it was, the burden of responsibility of being a spokesman for my parents was my oldest sister Saba.</span> <span id="s1612">Because of that, we feltI felt, that she was the privileged, she was the best liked, she had all the rights, I didn't have any rights because I was the youngest, okay.</span> <span id="s1613">So this put Estucia and me closer together.</span> <span id="s1614">And we were partners in crime.</span> <span id="s1615">We were confidantes.</span> <span id="s1616">We were very close together.</span> <span id="s1617">Ah, I always had some writing facility, even when I was very, very young.</span> <span id="s1618">And we had some kind of a pact, you know, that I used to write her essays for her and she used to do other things for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">04:03:02 So we were very close.</span> <span id="s1620">Another thing was, you know, in Poland, there was a certain age level where you could go into the movies.</span> <span id="s1621">It was Estucia's responsibility to take care of me when we used to go out.</span> <span id="s1622">She wanted to go with her friends to the movie theater.</span> <span id="s1623">She could fake her age.</span> <span id="s1624">I couldn't.</span> <span id="s1625">So there was a bribery going on.</span> <span id="s1626">She would give me the price of the ticket, she would go to the cinema.</span> <span id="s1627">My mother never knew about it.</span> <span id="s1628">I used to take the money and pocket it and get candies, which was verboten, verboten, you know, my mother didn't believe in that.</span> <span id="s1629">You don't eat candies before dinner, you spoil your appetite.</span> <span id="s1630">Wellso we were close together in kind of, you know, the type of things that children do.</span> <span id="s1631">And we were very close.</span> <span id="s1632">Ah, she was very graceful.</span> <span id="s1633">She was very beautiful.</span> <span id="s1634">She was a dancer, as I mentioned before.</span> <span id="s1635">You know, at home, when you have family and guests, parents like to show off with the children's talents.</span> <span id="s1636">So she used to dance for company, and I used to dance too.</span> <span id="s1637">But, of course, I was very tomboyish, and people would laugh when I would try to compete with her in dancing.</span> <span id="s1638">So I learned very quickly to be the kind of the buffoon, the joker, you know, turn it around into a joking type of thing because there was no way I could be next to her.</span> <span id="s1639">So we were, you know, by the constellation of the family, very, very close.</span> <span id="s1640">She was an adolescent during the war.</span> <span id="s1641">She had different preoccupations than I did.</span> <span id="s1642">I was still very much a child, when she already was in love with Humphrey Bogart, you know, so her interests were a little bit more sophisticated, more adult than mine, and she was more responsible.</span> <span id="s1643">And she was also the one bywho took care of me, you know, so I was very much, you know, under her protective wings.</span> <span id="s1644">And when we came into the camp, what kept us together is, again, this type of older sister/younger sister closeness.</span></p> <p><span id="s1645">Q. Tell meI forgot to ask you one question.</span> <span id="s1646">Was there ever a picture of Tyvek on her bunk?</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">A. Yes, there was.</span> <span id="s1648">There was a searchI didn't remember it, but Rose Metz reminded me that somebody made a sketch of Tyvek's picture.</span> <span id="s1649">And this picture was found under the mattress in our bed, I believe.</span> <span id="s1650">But I don't remember the details.</span> <span id="s1651">Rose would remember it much better.</span> <span id="s1652">I remember something about it, but not too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">Q. And you don't remember if there were consequences as a result of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">04:06:02</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">A. I know that Rose was cruelly beaten, beaten.</span> <span id="s1656">Was it because of the picture?</span> <span id="s1657">Was it because of the parcel?</span> <span id="s1658">I don't know.</span> <span id="s1659">One or the other.</span> <span id="s1660">I know that.</span> <span id="s1661">Terribly beaten, poor girl, it was awful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">Q. Tell me about Marta.</span></p> <p><span id="s1663">A. Marta.</span> <span id="s1664">Marta was born in Balkiov (ph), in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1665">Marta saved my life over and over and over again.</span> <span id="s1666">She promised Estucia.</span> <span id="s1667">Estucia asked her before the execution to promise her she is going to take care of me, so that she will die in peace.</span> <span id="s1668">And Marta fulfilled that promise.</span> <span id="s1669">She has been taking care of me ever since that day, one way or another.</span> <span id="s1670">We got to know Marta, we got very close to her.</span> <span id="s1671">In the beginning, was terrible.</span> <span id="s1672">Before we started work in the union, the block altester (ph), who was a friend of Marta, that was responsible for the block, was responsible to give a quota of workers to go and work in the commandos outside.</span> <span id="s1673">Of course, we, as people, were running away and we didn't want to be caught, we didn't want to work, we preferred to stay in camp and do nothing.</span> <span id="s1674">And not everybody was needed, only a part.</span> <span id="s1675">So I found myself a place, a beautiful hiding place, just behind the door of the entrance to the block and under the window of the room where the bread was being kept to be given out.</span> <span id="s1676">And Marta was responsible for giving out the bread.</span> <span id="s1677">Marta was worried for the block altester.</span> <span id="s1678">And every time I used to hide under the window, she used to come out and chase me out of there.</span> <span id="s1679">And I hated her with a passion.</span> <span id="s1680">And this is how we got to know each other.</span> <span id="s1681">And this is how we developed this very strong friendship for years.</span> <span id="s1682">Marta, because she was so early in the camp, was part of the administration clique of the Czech girls, so she had a little bit of pull.</span> <span id="s1683">Ah, she used to give us extra things, like a little bit more jam, like my first decent pair of shoes that I got in the camp was from Marta.</span></p> <p><span id="s1684">04:09:14 This was just prior to the death march that she gave me wonderful shoes to walk in.</span> <span id="s1685">Ah, Marta was the one that enabled my staying in the hospital.</span> <span id="s1686">Without Marta, it wouldn't have happened.</span> <span id="s1687">Marta was the one that was bringing me little gifts into the hospital.</span> <span id="s1688">I don't know where she took it, but she did.</span> <span id="s1689">Marta was the one that was the go‑between Estucia and me while Estucia was in the bunkers, through Jakob.</span> <span id="s1690">Marta was the one, when 1985, came from Belgium to Canada, Ottawa, to tell me to start talking about the story, to put the justice, late justice, to put the history in the proper perspective, to giveto vindicate the three girls that have been forgotten by the world, that nothing was written or talked about them because nobody did.</span> <span id="s1691">And she felt very strongly that it was my responsibility, as a sister, to bring it up and do something about it.</span> <span id="s1692">And it's only because of Marta's urging that I am doing that.</span> <span id="s1693">Marta lives in Belgium.</span> <span id="s1694">She has two daughterstwo children, a son and a daughter.</span> <span id="s1695">She has five grandchildren.</span> <span id="s1696">And we are very much in touch.</span> <span id="s1697">By the way, Marta was one of the women with whom Estucia used to leave the gunpowder packages in keeping, except that Marta didn't know what those packages contained.</span> <span id="s1698">For, you know, I don't know, it was just to accumulate a certain amount, not to go withit was every tiny little thing, until she had a little package to be delivered to Rosa Rabota, by whatever means.</span> <span id="s1699">She used to keep it in Marta's safekeeping.</span> <span id="s1700">And Marta didn't know what it was, but she was very much a part of it.</span> <span id="s1701">And Marta knows a lot about the things that were happening.</span> <span id="s1702">Marta knows about Rosa Rabota.</span> <span id="s1703">I don't know if she knew her personally.</span> <span id="s1704">She knows a great deal that I am not aware of.</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">Q.</span> <span id="s1706">Did Marta work in the union factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s1707">A. No.</span> <span id="s1708">No.</span> <span id="s1709">Neither did Rosa Rabota.</span></p> <p><span id="s1710">Q. Dora Kline (ph), you told me</span></p> <p><span id="s1711">04:12:02</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">A. Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1713">Q.a little bit about.</span> <span id="s1714">She just basically rescued you at one point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1715">A.

Kept you in the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">A. No.</span> <span id="s1721">Marta put me in the hospital.</span> <span id="s1722">Dora Kline, under the pseudonym of Slawka, S‑l‑a‑w‑k‑a, was the medical doctor in the hospital, and we developed a friendship.</span> <span id="s1723">I never knew that her name was Dora Kline.</span> <span id="s1724">Marta knew.</span> <span id="s1725">Marta knows everything.</span> <span id="s1726">And we developed a friendship and we used to chat in her office.</span> <span id="s1727">She was very muchshe was a very good doctor.</span> <span id="s1728">She has a wonderful bed manners.</span> <span id="s1729">She was a moral supporter for the girls who were sick in the hospital.</span> <span id="s1730">She was a real angel of mercy, and everybody knew, and adored her.</span> <span id="s1731">This was her.</span> <span id="s1732">She never rescued me for anything other than she has given me her time in the office to sit and chat and talk about anything under the sun.</span> <span id="s1733">I believe that she came to the camp also, not as a transport but as a partisan.</span> <span id="s1734">You know that there were two categories of Jewish prisoners, ones that came through the transport and ones that were kraktimasing (ph), those were the people that were picked up singly, not in a transport, but for the sabotage or partisan or were caught as bearing non‑Jewish papers, those people were registered in the camp under special category.</span> <span id="s1735">They were not subject to selection.</span> <span id="s1736">Okay.</span> <span id="s1737">Did you know that?</span> <span id="s1738">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1739">Okay.</span> <span id="s1740">So I believe that Marta was one of those.</span></p> <p><span id="s1741">Q. Regina?</span></p> <p><span id="s1742">A. Regina Sapperstein (ph), Regina Sapperstein, Regina Sapperstein was a little bit older than Estucia and I.</span> <span id="s1743">She was chunky, short, always with a smile on her face.</span> <span id="s1744">She always had a joke to tell.</span> <span id="s1745">Whatever it was, she was always in very good spirits.</span> <span id="s1746">She came from a little town, if I am not mistaken, was called Bengene (ph), in Poland.</span> <span id="s1747">I believe that she came from an orthodox family.</span> <span id="s1748">They were a very close‑knit family.</span> <span id="s1749">She was responsible for the girls working in the pulver room.</span> <span id="s1750">Ah, she did not sleep with us on the same bed, but we were very friendly working together, and her working so closely with Rose Metz and with Estucia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1751">04:15:09 And I remember her always as a happy‑go‑lucky type of a person, very, very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1752">Q. And Alla?</span></p> <p><span id="s1753">A. Alla was from Sosnowicz (ph), which isSosnowicz and Bengenas (ph), those are two little Jewish towns.</span> <span id="s1754">Alla was very tall, beautiful girl.</span> <span id="s1755">Ah, even, I'd say, difficult conditions in Auschwitz did noteven not having her did not turn her posture and her bearing, very sophisticated, a very intellectual girl.</span> <span id="s1756">And with beautiful, beautiful movements.</span> <span id="s1757">Alla was another one of this reluctant participators.</span> <span id="s1758">You know, nobody really wanted to do what we did.</span> <span id="s1759">We all knew it was an idiotic thing.</span> <span id="s1760">It was a suicidal thing.</span> <span id="s1761">Nevertheless, you know, she, with trepidations, turned us and fulfilled her work.</span> <span id="s1762">She was my contact in the toilets.</span> <span id="s1763">She was sleeping not far away on the bed, sharing with other people, not with us.</span> <span id="s1764">She was the one that was transferred from the Berklinas (ph) camp, where Rosa Rabota worked, to union.</span> <span id="s1765">I don't know why or how, but she knew Rosa very well.</span> <span id="s1766">A very sweet girl, rather shy, not very vigorous, not very courageous, you know, notbut courageous enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s1767">Q. Now, again, I ask you to clarify for me about the time when yourof the executions.</span> <span id="s1768">You got taken out of the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s1769">A. Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1770">Q. Just</span></p> <p><span id="s1771">A. I remember that the last message when I was in the hospital, and getting more and more depressed, Marta gave me the message that Jakob got orders from Berlin that the execution was stayed.</span> <span id="s1772">She never did tell me that this order was later changed.</span> <span id="s1773">One daynow, you have to remember, the blocks in Auschwitz were big two‑story buildings.</span></p> <p><span id="s1774">04:18:06 The hospital building was no different, it was the same, it was in the first row.</span> <span id="s1775">Our living quarters platz were in the next row.</span> <span id="s1776">The appellplatz was where the execution took place, was in between those barracks and another row of barracks, okay?</span> <span id="s1777">Barracks are the buildings.</span> <span id="s1778">One day, in the evening, after the union commando came back from work, Marta came to the hospital, took me out from the hospital, took me into the appellplatz, where the union commando stood to witness the execution.</span> <span id="s1779">I didn't know what was going on.</span> <span id="s1780">Out of the corner of my eye, I saw the gallows, but my conscious mind refused to see it.</span> <span id="s1781">I did and I didn't.</span> <span id="s1782">I was suddenly grabbed by Nellie and Sherry, who were two Jewish girls from Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1783">They were part of the administration of the block.</span> <span id="s1784">The union commando and the whole camp had to stand on appell.</span> <span id="s1785">Those that were responsible for the block, those that were the secretaries of the block, those that were the part of the administration of the block did not have to stand there.</span> <span id="s1786">Therefore, they grabbed me to protect me from witnessing what they knew was going to happen, which I didn't.</span> <span id="s1787">So they took me into their office and held me.</span> <span id="s1788">When I heard this awful scream of agony, this collective scream of all the assembled people who were watching the execution, I knew what happened.</span> <span id="s1789">I wanted to run out and they bodily stopped me.</span> <span id="s1790">Marta wasn't with us.</span> <span id="s1791">Marta run out.</span> <span id="s1792">And she was the one that screamed "revenge."</span> <span id="s1793">I don't know who.</span> <span id="s1794">I think, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1795">Then Marta came back.</span> <span id="s1796">And then I lost my mind.</span> <span id="s1797">13 days later, the evacuation of Auschwitz started.</span> <span id="s1798">I was useless.</span> <span id="s1799">I did not want to move.</span> <span id="s1800">I remember that when I finally realized that Estucia is dead, I was laughing, that I can die too, then I am going to commit suicide.</span></p> <p><span id="s1801">04:21:13 I knew that.</span> <span id="s1802">The following morning, I stood in the bathroom to brush my teeth and I thought to myself how awful, she is dead and I am brushing my teeth, and the world goes on as if nothing happened.</span> <span id="s1803">Nothing had changed, but my world was shattered.</span> <span id="s1804">But the world went on.</span> <span id="s1805">Then we walked through the death march.</span> <span id="s1806">Does this</span></p> <p><span id="s1807">Q. And the hanging was twice, two girls, twice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1808">A.</span> <span id="s1809">This is what I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1810">Q. And so you didn'tthe other one had already happened earlier?</span></p> <p><span id="s1811">A. I don't know which happened</span></p> <p><span id="s1812">Q.</span> <span id="s1813">But you didn't see either one?</span></p> <p><span id="s1814">A. No.</span> <span id="s1815">No.</span> <span id="s1816">And, you know, that this unresolved death, this inability to say goodbye, makes it, at some level, unfinished.</span> <span id="s1817">After the war, I was actively looking into the faces of people, looking for my parents and looking for my sister.</span> <span id="s1818">Now, part of me, of course, knew, but part of me, because I didn't say goodbye, because I didn't see them die, just was irrationally looking for some kind of a resolution.</span> <span id="s1819">Maybe, maybe, maybe it never happened.</span> <span id="s1820">Maybe I will find them.</span> <span id="s1821">Well, in 1993, I went with a group of university students from Canada to Majdanek, to Auschwitz, to Majdanek, to revisit the death camps.</span> <span id="s1822">And in Majdanek, the Poles have scooped as much of the ashes and bones that they could that were left after, and they made the monument with a round capula (ph) kind of a roof around it.</span> <span id="s1823">And I was standing there and one of the students asked me: "How do you feel?"</span> <span id="s1824">I said to him: "I feel relieved."</span> <span id="s1825">Now it came, not from the mind it came, you know, that's how I feel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1826">04:24:03 And I said to him, you know, I finally found my parents' grave.</span> <span id="s1827">I couldn't say a prayeryou can't say a prayer for people when you don't have a grave.</span> <span id="s1828">But there, among those ashes, are my parents' remains.</span> <span id="s1829">And as I said it, suddenly, as plainly as I see you, I saw thousands and thousands of faces pushing, jostling, screaming at me in Yiddishwhich I don't know very welltell them, tell them.</span> <span id="s1830">Thank them for coming and remembering us.</span> <span id="s1831">Thank them for coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s1832">Q. Thank you.</span> <span id="s1833">Let's cut for just a second.</span> <span id="s1834">How much tape do we have?</span></p> <p><span id="s1835">(A diagram is shown on the screen)</span></p> <p><span id="s1836">A.</span> <span id="s1837">This is a drawing of the union factory floor plan that I made in 1945 out of memory.</span> <span id="s1838">This is the main entrance.</span> <span id="s1839">This is the corridor.</span> <span id="s1840">And this is where I worked.</span> <span id="s1841">There is a big glass partition between this department and this one.</span> <span id="s1842">I walked from my place behind the table, around here, under the glass office of the supervisor of the factory, which was made on elevation, and glass, so that he could have a viewa better view of the whole factory, up to the pulver room.</span> <span id="s1843">This was the door to pulver room, where Estucia worked.</span> <span id="s1844">I would give her two empty boxes.</span> <span id="s1845">She would give me two full boxes with gunpowder hidden at the bottom box.</span> <span id="s1846">I would retrace my steps right back to my place, put the boxes on the floor under the table, take out the gunpowder, ask permission to go to the toilet, which is right here.</span> <span id="s1847">And here I would share my amount of gunpowder with Alla Gardner (ph) in the toilet.</span> <span id="s1848">After work, we would stand in the rows of five, go out to Birkenau, where we would leave the gunpowder with Estucia, who then distributed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1849">04:28:15 End of Tape 4.</span></p> <p><span id="s1850">USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0258 PAGE 2</span></p></body></html>
