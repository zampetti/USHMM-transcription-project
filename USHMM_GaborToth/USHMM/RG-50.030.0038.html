1989</span></p> <p><span id="s10">01:00:11</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: Could you please tell us your name and where you were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: My name is Leo Bretholz.</span> <span id="s13">Do I have to spell that?</span> <span id="s14">I usually do have to.</span> <span id="s15">And I was born in Vienna, Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: In what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: 1921.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: Tell us about the family which you grew up in.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: Our family was a normal, or what you might call a “normal family.”</span> <span id="s20">My father was a tailor.</span> <span id="s21">They were originally from Poland.</span> <span id="s22">My parents were -- came to Austria right after the first World War, married in Austria, and there were three children in the family.</span> <span id="s23">There would have been a fourth, but that child, a boy, died six weeks after birth.</span> <span id="s24">I was the oldest.</span> <span id="s25">My sister was a year and a half younger, and the other one, born in 1928, was seven years younger.</span> <span id="s26">A normal family, as I said, with schools and activities, fun -- although some of that was disrupted by the death of my father in 1930.</span> <span id="s27">I was nine years old, the oldest at the time of the three children.</span> <span id="s28">And, my mother, a young widow at 35, never remarried.</span> <span id="s29">My father was And it sort of made me a father image, young as I was, to my children -- to my sisters -- because my mother had to go to work and support the young family.</span> <span id="s30">But that was all bearable and we coped as best we could.</span> <span id="s31">We do not want to forget that in those years it was still, if not depression, but very close to just, just post-depression.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: Tell us about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: And these were hard times.</span> <span id="s34">Just as here in America in the middle ‘30s, latter ‘30s, we had to make with -- make ends meet with what was available to us.</span> <span id="s35">And income -- my mother was a, as I said, a widow who had to come up with, with the support of the family, and there were Jewish organizations who helped out in that respect.</span> <span id="s36">And the real, the real tragedy began then in 1938 with the annexation of Austria.</span> <span id="s37">Where that family structure, that family entity as in so many hundreds and thousands and millions of cases, that family entity overnight was destroyed.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: Tell us about -- before you begin with 1938, tell me about a Jewish child growing up in Vienna as a Jew.</span> <span id="s39">Were you aware of being a Jew, and what did that mean as a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: Vienna and Austria had a history of antisemitic activities and antisemitic attitudes.</span> <span id="s41">When we grew up in Austria, as Jews, we were always aware of the fact that we were Jewish.</span> <span id="s42">It so happens that I lived in a district in Vienna where there were more Jews than in other districts.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">01:04:27 It was the 20th district, and the second district had more Jews than the 20th, and a few other districts had -- but the majority of the areas were non-Jewish or very few Jews and antisemitism was almost a part of daily life.</span> <span id="s44">It's not that we thought a lot about it, because it just became part of life.</span> <span id="s45">If you, if you, if you live with something everyday, then it becomes part of you and you cope with it, if it didn't become too violent.</span> <span id="s46">But from time to time, there were denigrations.</span> <span id="s47">Sometime we were spit at.</span> <span id="s48">Sometime we were singled out for a particular rough treatments in schools, the Easter and Christmas seasons particularly.</span> <span id="s49">When I think back to those days, to me they represent a certain trauma because we, we were set apart.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">There was Easter dealing with a religious connotation of Christ and the resurrection which automatically brings back the killing of Christ, and that was the Jewish misdeed.</span> <span id="s51">And at Christmas time it was -- again we, we couldn't, we couldn't be part of a, of a festive mood even if we wanted to.</span> <span id="s52">Oh, there were many times when we did participate with neighbors in trimming a tree or sharing in, in the Christmas cookies and that sort of thing, but that was all surface.</span> <span id="s53">As children, we did things like this because we were part of a, of a, of a greater community where there were non-Jewish children and we, we related to them.</span> <span id="s54">But the excesses took place at certain times for certain reasons and especially during the depression years.</span> <span id="s55">I was then in my early young years, but I do remember that often could we hear that all these economic problems -- and even the first World War -- it was all the fault of the Jews.</span> <span id="s56">So we were being maligned and singled out and we didn't like it, but nevertheless we asserted ourselves in some way because when, when we went on outings with the Hebrew schools, we, we sometime carried the Jewish blue and white flag and we were taunted for that by people who were looking at us.</span> <span id="s57">But it was a segment in history that does not reflect too well on, on the Austrian attitude towards Jews, and when we go later into ‘38, it is very easily perceptible.</span> <span id="s58">You can touch it.</span> <span id="s59">You can feel it.</span> <span id="s60">You could see it, that as soon as the Austrian Anschlusstook place, Austria in the next five, six weeks, or perhaps several months, the Jews in Austria underwent much more hardship in those few weeks or months than the Jews of Germany did in the previous five years from ‘33 to ‘38.</span> <span id="s61">It lent itself -- the climate in Austria lent itself more to antisemitic excesses.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">01:08:25</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: Give us examples.</span> <span id="s64">It's 1938, you have described a really dramatic change in your feelings.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">What happened?</span> <span id="s66">What happened to Leo Bretholz?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: Seeing that some of my uncles had been arrested and many of our friends and neighbors had been arrested, my mother actually urged me to think of leaving as soon as I possibly could -- 1 Term used to described the incorporation of Austria in the German Reich on March 11, 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">leaving Vienna.</span> <span id="s69">I had already left school.</span> <span id="s70">And an aunt of mine had left for Luxembourg right after the Anschluss, and we planned for me to join that aunt and her husband, my uncle, in Luxembourg as soon as I would be able to -- as soon as arrangements could be made.</span> <span id="s71">It was my mother who prevailed upon me to leave because she said that for boys and for men, it will be very bad, as we can see.</span> <span id="s72">People were arrested every day and within days or the most a few weeks, ashes were sent back of these people to their, to their relatives.</span> <span id="s73">Now whether they were these peoples ashes or not, nobody could ever find out.</span> <span id="s74">But they received a container with ashes, describing them as the ashes of the deceased who was caught trying to escape and shot because shooting was a justification for, for catching someone who tried to escape, killing someone, or that he had contracted a disease, a pneumonia.</span> <span id="s75">But there were these, these explanations given which no one hardly even believed because some of the people who were freed from camps periodically brought back other horror stories, so we know that.</span> <span id="s76">My mother was very much bent on sending me away, and frankly, it is constantly a source of guilt for me, to know that she had sent me away and they couldn't do it.</span> <span id="s77">But then when I consulted with psychiatrist, because I didn't want to have to live with feelings such as these, he confirmed to me that, “Would your mother be able to speak today, she would still say…she was glad she did it.”</span> <span id="s78">So, to begin with, she was actually instrumental in getting me out and saving my life.</span> <span id="s79">She was a good woman.</span> <span id="s80">My mother was what you might call in, in Hebrew, it's described as “Eshet Khayil,”-- woman of valor.</span> <span id="s81">She did the best she could under the circumstances.</span> <span id="s82">I am breaking down because…she never had a chance in life… She and my sisters and 55 others of my family never had a chance in life.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">01:12:00</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: What did she do?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: She was a widow and had to struggle to support the family and always helped poor people, people that were less well-off than we or less fortunate.</span> <span id="s86">Always helped somebody.</span> <span id="s87">There was this poor painter around the corner from us.</span> <span id="s88">When the apartment needed painting, she called him.</span> <span id="s89">He didn't even do a good job, but he needs the job.</span> <span id="s90">And when it was finished, the painting wasn't -- the painted room was sort of streaky, but she had given Mr. Fried a job because he needed it for his family, you see.</span> <span id="s91">But, I got to get myself together to make this thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: Let's pull it back.</span> <span id="s93">Pull it back.</span> <span id="s94">Your mother... A: She urged me to leave, and I did leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: Where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: I took a train from Vienna, Frankfurt, Koblenz, to the west of Germany and Trier, the ancient town of Trier.</span> <span id="s97">By arrangement with a committee in Luxembourg; it was called the Ezra 2 Woman of valor (Hebrew).</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Committee.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">01:13:55</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: Who were the Ezra Committee?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: The Ezra was an aid committee, almost like a HIAS,perhaps.</span> <span id="s102">Aid to refugees that came from Germany and Austria to Luxembourg, provide some shelter, provide food, kitchen, and help these people who could not stay in Luxembourg unless they had regularized, temporary documents.</span> <span id="s103">Somebody came with a passport and a, and a, and a visa could do that.</span> <span id="s104">Others that fled and came illegally, could not.</span> <span id="s105">And the Ezra committee was such a committee.</span> <span id="s106">And a Mr. Becker who was the smuggler that smuggled me across from Trier into Luxembourg, was in the employ of Ezra.</span> <span id="s107">In a way because later when I went to Belgium, he was also the one that smuggled us into Belgium, but I am jumping ahead here.</span> <span id="s108">But we were -- I went to the border town of Trier, and on the 31st of October, Mr. Becker picked me up in Trier and smuggled me across the border.</span> <span id="s109">Actually he took me to the river, the Sauer River and asked me cross and then meet him at the other side of the Sauer.</span> <span id="s110">And during the night from October 31st to November the first, after it had been raining for four or five days in western Germany -- these are the rainy periods there -- I crossed into Luxembourg.</span> <span id="s111">He had asked me to put a pair of dry socks into my coat pocket so that when I came across and once I had crossed, I would put these dry socks on, which at the point was not even possible because I didn't have dry socks in my pocket after I had crossed the river.</span> <span id="s112">When he told me I was to cross that river, I asked him would I -- no, he asked me do I know how to swim.</span> <span id="s113">I said, "Yes, I know how to swim."</span> <span id="s114">I said, "Would it be necessary, you think?"</span> <span id="s115">because he told me I would wade across.</span> <span id="s116">But no way could I wade across that river after four days of rain because that river carried a lot of torrential waters with debris, branches, mud, all kind of things.</span> <span id="s117">That river springs in the Ardenne Mountains and comes down.</span> <span id="s118">It's a, it's really a tributary of the Moselle, a small river which under normal circumstances is a creek, a small stream.</span> <span id="s119">I went there later in years with, with my family to get to that same area, and people were just waiting there ankle deep, knee deep in that particular... But I crossed, and the first step I took into the river, I was up to my knees and the second step up to my chest, and then here go the dry socks in my pocket, and it wasn't a concern of mine.</span> <span id="s120">My concern was to get across.</span> <span id="s121">And I did!</span> <span id="s122">And on the other side, Mr. Becker was waiting to take me into Luxembourg, and my aunt was waiting there, and I had crossed into safety.</span> <span id="s123">Or at the moment, relative safety, because three days later, I was arrested in Luxembourg.</span> <span id="s124">The police came into this cafe where I was sitting and having breakfast just a couple of days after I had crossed.</span> <span id="s125">Actually, my coat was still wet and not even dried yet, and they asked for my papers and I didn't have them, so they arrested me and took me to jail, and I spent the night in jail in the Luxembourg jail -- by the way, a very clean facility.</span> <span id="s126">And the next morning, they interrogated me.</span> <span id="s127">How did I come over?</span> <span id="s128">I said, "I crossed the river.</span> <span id="s129">The river Sauer."</span> <span id="s130">"Who brought you over?"</span> <span id="s131">I said, "I just crossed."</span> <span id="s132">"And how did you get into Luxembourg."</span> <span id="s133">"I just walked into Luxembourg."</span> <span id="s134">I 3 Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">wasn't going to say, "Mr. Becker brought me over."</span> <span id="s136">And, well, it is my choice.</span> <span id="s137">I have two choices.</span> <span id="s138">I can pick a place where I want to be taken to out of Luxembourg, either Belgium or France or back to Germany.</span> <span id="s139">So the choice was very simple.</span> <span id="s140">I said, "Well, I have an aunt in Paris.</span> <span id="s141">Maybe I can make my way to Paris."</span> <span id="s142">So they decided, yes, take me to the border, to this Luxembourg-French border.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">01:18:59 There is a little town called Thionville-les-Bains.</span> <span id="s144">It is like a thermal spa.</span> <span id="s145">And they took me there and they -- the next morning -- and they -- commuter train that went to the border, just about a half an hour or 40 minute ride.</span> <span id="s146">And I crossed into France.</span> <span id="s147">But earlier before we went -- before we took that train, at the railroad station, when they went to the ticket to, to, to show that to the ticket window that day, were transporting me, whatever, they needed to have transportation.</span> <span id="s148">My uncle had found out that next day I will be taken to the border, appeared at the railroad station and he wore a cap.</span> <span id="s149">And he was standing on the side, and I noticed him and he noticed me, and he did this to his cap, the visor of the cap: he turned it around.</span> <span id="s150">There is an expression in Yiddish which translates “Turn the visor around,” which to me meant, “If you can come back, come back.”</span> <span id="s151">And when they had taken me to the border and I crossed, they indicated to me that the other end of the border, just a few hundred yards inside France, there is a Jewish camp, they said.</span> <span id="s152">That's all they told me.</span> <span id="s153">And they will probably be able help me.</span> <span id="s154">But when I told them earlier, "How do you want me to manage going into France by myself?</span> <span id="s155">Can you --” They said, "Well, you just told us that you managed to swim a river and come into Luxembourg.</span> <span id="s156">Now if you could make it across a river, you will make it across dry land, we know."</span> <span id="s157">They were sort of patronizing me but also very nice to me.</span> <span id="s158">They were not in any way vicious.</span> <span id="s159">They were just doing their job to get me out of there.</span> <span id="s160">And I was glad they didn't -- that I wasn't sent back to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">01:21:18 As I crossed into France, I went to that camp and it was a preparatory camp, hakh’sharah, where, where Jewish young people were preparing for aleeyahto Palestine.</span> <span id="s162">I got into this area and somebody at the gate actually stopped me, wanted to know who I am, and I said, "I am a Jewish fellow, just escaped from Germany.</span> <span id="s163">The Luxembourg people told me -- Luxembourg authorities told me that you might be able to help me.</span> <span id="s164">…” “Well, they do that periodically just to make you feel that when you get across the border, you will be all right.”</span> <span id="s165">“There will be no problem so that they should be off the hook.</span> <span id="s166">But actually as many as we get here periodically, we do get some.</span> <span id="s167">We always have to tell them that the French authorities tolerate us here.</span> <span id="s168">We have only temporary permits to live in France, and if we are being in any way compromised to give you shelter, to help you further your, your travel in France, they will dissolve this camp, so we can't do it.”</span> <span id="s169">Being that far away from Paris and not having money on me, I thought of my uncle's turning the visor around and waited until 4 Special training for youth preparing to settle in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">5 Immigration to Israel (Hebrew).</span></p> <p><span id="s171">nightfall to cross back into Luxembourg and made my way back to Luxembourg city during the night.</span> <span id="s172">The last leg of that trip was in early morning catching a farmer with bales of hay or whatever he was carrying on his wagon to get me to the city line of Luxembourg.</span> <span id="s173">And from there I found my way to the address of my aunt.</span> <span id="s174">An hour later I showed -- a couple of hours later I showed up at the apartment where she lived.</span> <span id="s175">I rapped on the door and my uncle stood there and my aunt was sick in bed from, from aggravation that she had brought me there and now I was arrested again.</span> <span id="s176">I was a kid of 17 years old.</span> <span id="s177">She -- that aunt lives today in Baltimore.</span> <span id="s178">She is in her 80s.</span> <span id="s179">She is my father's, my father's youngest sister.</span> <span id="s180">And as soon as I opened the door, my uncle said, turning to her, "I told you he'll be back."</span> <span id="s181">So, then they prevailed through the Ezra Committee to have me stay with a family in Luxembourg where about a half or dozen or more people were also staying waiting for further disposition of their situation.</span> <span id="s182">And I stayed there from the night of the second, third of November to the ninth -- six days.</span> <span id="s183">And the night of the ninth to the 10th of November, exactly Kristallnacht night, Mr. Becker took six or seven of us into Belgium, smuggled us into Belgium, into Brussels.</span> <span id="s184">And it was during that night that we saw the strange phenomenum looking to the east as we traveled in the car of skies that had changed their color.</span> <span id="s185">It was the night sky, but we could see reflections almost some eerie looking reflections of reddish-purplish coloration and it was only the next morning in Brussels that we found out that Kristallnacht had happened in Germany where hundreds of synagogues and businesses and homes had been set afire and, of course, Luxembourg being in this tristate area, Belgium/Luxembourg/France, we were very close to the border.</span> <span id="s186">And chances are the flames that we saw reflecting were those that happened in Trier or Koblenz or other border, border, localities that were evidently destroyed in that night of horror which many considered the beginning of the end of the European Jews -- Judaism, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: What happened?</span> <span id="s188">You are now in Belgium.</span> <span id="s189">What did you do?</span> <span id="s190">01:25:55</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: The next day after we had contacted the Jewish committee in Brussels, in Brussels, Belgium, they gave us transportation to go to Antwerp.</span> <span id="s192">We took that train which is a train that goes every 20 minutes; a electric train from Brussels to Antwerpen.</span> <span id="s193">Within an hour, we were in Antwerp, again going to the Aid Committee who were registering us, giving us food coupons, and trying to help us regularize our situation as refugees from Germany to Belgium.</span> <span id="s194">I met an uncle of mine there who had left Vienna., my mother's brother, distant relatives which came from the same town as my mother, which we found out about.</span> <span id="s195">And from November '38 to May 1940, I spent 18 months in Belgium, which were pleasant months with distant relatives and friends, constantly under the pressure of not being sent -- avoiding to be sent to a camp because they also had camps for these refugees.</span> <span id="s196">Somebody working in that committee, also a Viennese fellow who worked there in, in the office helping out with paperwork made sure that when the time came to select people for the camps that I was not being considered for it because they tried to get me into a school, to register in a school, and I did.</span> <span id="s197">And having registered in that Flemish school, I became authorized to stay with a temporary ID card which I have here with me, too, as a memento.</span> <span id="s198">And periodically we knew that temporary permit to stay.</span> <span id="s199">It was a school which, in Dutch -- Flemish -- was called "Openbaar Beroep School voor Jongens,”which means "Public Trade School for Boys."</span> <span id="s200">And I took a course in electrotechnical, studies, you know, was a trade school.</span> <span id="s201">Took also languages and I learned Flemish almost, almost to perfection.</span> <span id="s202">I had good marks in the Flemish language and as a young man you learn faster, and I had a facility for languages anyway.</span> <span id="s203">So that's why I was in this trade school.</span> <span id="s204">With my distant relatives in 1939, I went for a week's vacation to the ocean.</span> <span id="s205">All along I got letters from my mother and sisters that they were coping, that things were at the normal rate as normal can be considered, and I always had intended to bring them over, but I didn't have the money to do it, because you had to pay a smuggler.</span> <span id="s206">And they themselves were not really urging me, my mother and sisters.</span> <span id="s207">Because they -- the mood was that “How long can this last?”</span> <span id="s208">or this sort of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">There was constantly that hope against hope.</span> <span id="s210">How much can it last?</span> <span id="s211">Although when my uncle brought his wife and daughter and son over to Belgium, he had to pay an amount, whatever it was, to the smuggler.</span> <span id="s212">I asked him why it wasn't possible to bring my mother also -- at least suggest.</span> <span id="s213">So he said, you know, they had to leave on quietly.</span> <span id="s214">Nobody could know about it.</span> <span id="s215">The fewer people knew about it, the better it was, and again the money aspect was something that we didn't even discuss because that sort of becomes something of a very delicate situation.</span> <span id="s216">But my mother and sisters did not come and actually, really didn't urge me to do something for them to come.</span> <span id="s217">They felt it'll, it'll work itself out.</span> <span id="s218">Then in '42, we found out differently.</span> <span id="s219">When I was in Belgium then, then, of course, in 1939, the War broke out.</span> <span id="s220">So after 1939, September 1939, there was no longer any question of anybody leaving from Austria.</span> <span id="s221">By that time even they had wanted to...had they wanted to leave, there would be no problem, no way to do it.</span> <span id="s222">That would be a problem, you see, would have been because the war was on.</span> <span id="s223">The Germans were fortifying the borders and Maginot Line in the south of France and the Siegfried Line further to the north.</span> <span id="s224">There was no possibility any longer after '39 for anybody to come across, although some tried and did.</span> <span id="s225">But it wasn't as open and free as up to the beginning of the war.</span> <span id="s226">And, of course, in 1940, in May 1940, on the 10th of May, the Germans attacked the lowlands, Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">01:31:12</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: Where were you and what where you doing when the Germans attacked ?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: That is the day that I will never have to guess where I was, because I was in a hospital.</span> <span id="s230">I had a hernia and I had decided to see a doctor and rather to go on with a hernia bothering -- having from time to time -- why not do it?</span> <span id="s231">And on Thursday night, May the ninth, I went to the hospital at Antwerpen in a suburb of Antwerpen called Berchen and the same evening they prepared me for the operation of next day, meaning cleaning my body, shaving, that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s232">And operation was to take place next day, about seven in the morning.</span> <span id="s233">Between 5:00 and 6:00, Friday the 10th, fire bombs were flown over Antwerpen.</span> <span id="s234">Visibly.</span> <span id="s235">We could actually see them.</span> <span id="s236">In fact one of those bombs dropped right into the yard, the courtyard of that hospital.</span> <span id="s237">And the order came for those who were ambulant to pick up their documents in 6 Public Trade School for Boys (Flemish).</span></p> <p><span id="s238">the office and leave the hospital.</span> <span id="s239">And I left the hospital, never been operated on.</span> <span id="s240">I made my way, not where I lived in my apartment that was in the middle of the town, but in that suburb where my distant relative lived, and I made my way to their apartment.</span> <span id="s241">And that time I already found out that there were notifications, proclamations that all aliens of enemy alien origin have to register with the Belgium authorities.</span> <span id="s242">Although I had Polish nationality due to the fact that my parents were never naturalized in Vienna, I as a Viennese-born person could not be an Austrian until I would have been 21 years old with the first military service.</span> <span id="s243">It's not like in America.</span> <span id="s244">When you are born America, you are an American.</span> <span id="s245">And so I was, to all intent and purposes, also a Polish citizen which showed on my ID, and I went and registered and in good faith, hoping that they will see “Polish citizen.”</span> <span id="s246">I couldn't have done differently anyway because they would have caught me or perhaps I could have fled.</span> <span id="s247">But in good faith, I did it.</span> <span id="s248">Like many hundreds did.</span> <span id="s249">I am, number one, I am of Polish nationality.</span> <span id="s250">And the Poles are Allies because Poland had been attacked, and besides that, even born in Austria or others in Germany, we were the first victims of this Nazi regime.</span> <span id="s251">We are here now.</span> <span id="s252">We came here looking for shelter, for refuge, as people who ran away from that system.</span> <span id="s253">So we're certainly not enemies of you.</span> <span id="s254">We are enemies of that system.</span> <span id="s255">But in bureaucracy, that doesn't count.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">When you are born on enemy in enemy territory, that makes you an enemy alien, I guess.</span> <span id="s257">And a train took us to southern France.</span> <span id="s258">After we were arrested, we were told to bring a change of clothes, a toothbrush, a blanket, and food for a day.</span> <span id="s259">And they transported us to the south of France.</span> <span id="s260">Ironically enough, Germans were with us.</span> <span id="s261">German Nazis were with us in that train.</span> <span id="s262">They also had to register, but to them that was just a formality because eventually they knew they would be exchanged for Belgium nationals because that goes in international relations as a normal procedure.</span> <span id="s263">But we as Jews, number one, we were not exchangeable, and number two, we wouldn't have wanted to be exchanged.</span> <span id="s264">Were we arrested, number one, we would have wanted to, and number two, we were not exchangeable, whichever.</span> <span id="s265">For us, that didn't count.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: Belgians have deported you as an enemy alien.</span> <span id="s267">You are going on a train to the south of France.</span> <span id="s268">Where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">01:36:15</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: To a camp called Saint-Cyprien.</span> <span id="s271">The ironic, more irony, that when we got out of that train, in the camp on the way to Saint-Cyprien where we stopped for one night near Agde somewhere.</span> <span id="s272">When we looked at our train on the outside, the facing of the train, in white paint, it was marked 5th Column -- "Cinquieme Colonne.”</span> <span id="s273">So they transported us as Fifth Column people.</span> <span id="s274">No wonder that when we traversed the French countryside from north to south that in those small stations where we did, where we made periodic stops, that people were doing this to us [making “slitting throat” gesture].</span> <span id="s275">They thought we were, you know, Germans.</span> <span id="s276">We wound up in Saint-Cyprien, a camp in the Department of Pyrénées-Orientales in France, right near the Spanish border near a major town, a larger town called Perpignan.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">7 Fifth Column (French).</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: Tell me about Saint-Cyprien.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: Saint-Cyprien was a -- an established camp.</span> <span id="s280">That was -- this was 1940, so that camp had been established somewhere between '36 and '38, mainly holding Spanish refugees that had come into France due to the Civil War in Spain.</span> <span id="s281">People had left Spain; the duress of the war -- fled into France and there at Saint-Cyprien at the time, was nothing but beach.</span> <span id="s282">So these refuges from Spain had come there, and established a camp facility.</span> <span id="s283">First they had tents, then they built barracks with undulated metal roofs and later more barracks were built, but the floors in the barracks were not floors.</span> <span id="s284">They were sand.</span> <span id="s285">It was just the uprights were there and the roof.</span> <span id="s286">But in the barracks, it was just the sand of the, of the beach.</span> <span id="s287">And there, straw was put on there and we were lying on that sand on that straw in that barrack -- shelter.</span> <span id="s288">As we walked through the sand, to go to the latrine, or to go to the kitchen to pick up the rations, we walked sometime on bones.</span> <span id="s289">A jaw bone here, a tail bone there, a skull here there of domestic animals, donkeys and horses and goats and dogs.</span> <span id="s290">The Spaniards had brought these animals with them.</span> <span id="s291">They were farmers.</span> <span id="s292">They were people who had a little livestock.</span> <span id="s293">They brought them with them, and in the process they died or they killed them even for food.</span> <span id="s294">And this, this was the scene there.</span> <span id="s295">The ocean periodically -- the tide carried the waters up to the barracks and sometimes right into the barracks, the ones that were closest to the shore.</span> <span id="s296">A beautiful sight it was scenically because there was the Mediterranean and there in the not too distant future were the Pyrénées Mountains jutting right into the Mediterranean, so scenically this was a beautiful place.</span> <span id="s297">And if any of us had thought to escape, that wasn't possible because at the end of the beach where the beach meets the ocean, you had barbed wires.</span> <span id="s298">And patrol boats were cruising so if somebody would go through the barbed wire and try to swim, they would be detected.</span> <span id="s299">The better way to escape would have been trying to escape from the camp, and then by foot make it into Spain.</span> <span id="s300">Be this as it may, we got there in May of 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Sometime in July or early August, and I couldn't pinpoint that, dysentery developed in -- broke out in that camp, and typhoid fever.</span> <span id="s302">There were a handful of latrines.</span> <span id="s303">There was a male section camp and a female section camp.</span> <span id="s304">There was a handful of latrines, and with the condition under which we labored, it was a constant line to these latrines.</span> <span id="s305">And they were elevated on stilts because the ocean would come in -- the seat of the latrine would be covered, so it was on stilts.</span> <span id="s306">So you walked up those stilts and there was that one door, that swinging door like, and you would go up there and relieve yourself and as soon as you were sitting down somebody rapped on the door, so you had to get out and get in line again.</span> <span id="s307">And there was no paper.</span> <span id="s308">There was no tissue paper.</span> <span id="s309">There was not even a newspaper.</span> <span id="s310">So what we used was straw.</span> <span id="s311">It's awful to bring back these things, but these are all segments of dehumanization that people go through and you somehow cope with it because you live and you hope you will survive.</span> <span id="s312">What happened later, of course, these situations were almost bearable, sometimes even comical.</span> <span id="s313">And I escaped from that camp with another fellow.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: Tell us about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: Some people that we knew in Antwerp who came from Antwerp as Belgian citizens with a stream of refugees into the area, this is the general southern area from Toulouse to the Pyrénées.</span> <span id="s316">One of our friends by the name of Oesterreicher had finally arrived in Toulouse and he had inquired with the authorities where some of the people that were transported into France were taken.</span> <span id="s317">And they told him, the foremost reception for these camps, they called them “Centre d'Accueil,”-- Center of -- Reception Center.</span> <span id="s318">Like they had a red carpet out for us, or something like that.</span> <span id="s319">.</span> <span id="s320">These euphemisms, they have their way of creeping into a language and then that's what it is.</span> <span id="s321">And they found out that we were in this camp, and Oesterreicher wrote to us.</span> <span id="s322">We could receive mail there.</span> <span id="s323">Communication between people who had left in the train and others that left by car on their own volition because they want to get away from the war zone.</span> <span id="s324">So, sort of, families through Red Cross and through authorities found each other.</span> <span id="s325">That's communication.</span> <span id="s326">Slowly as it went, it still helped.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">01:43:35 And Oesterreicher found out that we, that we were taken to this camp, and he came to the camp and asked the commandatur, the office to issue a visiting permit so that he can visit his friend.</span> <span id="s328">And they called me that there is a friend here visiting.</span> <span id="s329">And I got dressed, went to the visiting area, and he told me then, "Why don't you go back and get your shoes?”</span> <span id="s330">I was barefoot.</span> <span id="s331">“Get your shoes, get your clothes because I think you can get out of here."</span> <span id="s332">I say, "How do you do it?"</span> <span id="s333">He said, "I see that these guards here are not very watchful.</span> <span id="s334">They are half asleep.</span> <span id="s335">They walk around.</span> <span id="s336">They talk.</span> <span id="s337">They talk to the internees.</span> <span id="s338">They exchange cigarettes.</span> <span id="s339">You can give them cigarettes and you can give them chocolates and they will be, will be looking away, maybe.”</span> <span id="s340">So I went back to the camp and took my things and told my uncle who was there with me from Belgium and his son, a cousin, that I am leaving with a friend.</span> <span id="s341">They were not amenable to fleeing.</span> <span id="s342">They said, “Oh, we will.”</span> <span id="s343">because they had, they had -- he had his wife still in Belgium, the other one had his wife still in Belgium, so they were not going to go anywhere where, where, where their wives may have, have no knowledge where they are.</span> <span id="s344">In other words, you are there, and you hope that these authorities will take care of it.</span> <span id="s345">As you saw others were exchanged, you hoped that you perhaps would be let out and -- but with the situation that it was, that there was dysentery and all this illness.</span> <span id="s346">The guards themselves were not crazy about guarding these people because they're not immune to that.</span> <span id="s347">I mean, dysentery can spread across a barbed wire too, you see.</span> <span id="s348">So they relaxed their watchfulness.</span> <span id="s349">And my friend was right!</span> <span id="s350">When we walked out, we walked across the barbed wire that was surrounding the compound where the, where the office was.</span> <span id="s351">He walked out the regular door, the regular gate, because he had his permit to visit me, and I did not.</span> <span id="s352">But as we walked there, we saw at the bottom that one of those barbed wires was actually lifted off.</span> <span id="s353">So he said, "If you can climb through that underneath and cross behind the barrack, they won't even see you.</span> <span id="s354">Join me in front."</span> <span id="s355">And that's exactly what I did.</span> <span id="s356">That was exactly what I did.</span> <span id="s357">And we walked into the little town of Perpignan.</span> <span id="s358">We bought a box of peach preserves and a slice of Roquefort cheese, and I learned how good preserves can taste on a fully ripened cheese.</span> <span id="s359">That is a great combination.</span> <span id="s360">You should try that sometime.</span> <span id="s361">And he brought some money for tickets, my friend did, to go to Toulouse, to travel to Toulouse.</span> <span id="s362">And he knew where these people that I had been with in Belgium.</span> <span id="s363">My distant relatives had finally also come from Belgium into France, and they located themselves into a little town called 8 Reception center (French).</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Bagnères-de-Luchon in the Pyrénées.</span> <span id="s365">I got a ticket from Toulouse to Bagnères-de-Luchon and joined up with them.</span> <span id="s366">And with them, I spent most of the time in France living in the same places there, then we were taken to forced residence, and then we were taken to another forced residence, but they were always involved, these people.</span> <span id="s367">Their family name was Frajermauer.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">01:47:31</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: Spell it.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: F-R-A-J-E-R-M-A-U-E-R.</span> <span id="s371">Frajermauer.</span> <span id="s372">The German word frajermauer means freemason.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">But that's sort of a derivative of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: And your friend's name?</span> <span id="s375">A: Oesterreicher.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: Will you spell that?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: O-E-S-T-E-R-R-E-I-C-H-E-R, which translated means "Austrian."</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: So you are there in this town.</span> <span id="s379">You are in the town and what happened to you?</span> <span id="s380">You lived there for awhile?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: I lived in Bagnères-de-Luchon from 1940 to 1941, to the beginning of '41, when we were asked to leave Luchon beginning of '41, to join other Jews who had been confined in that assigned residence of Bagnères-de-Bigorre.</span> <span id="s382">Bagnères -- B-A-G-N-E-R-E-S D-E.</span> <span id="s383">That's " Bagnères," one word; "de" is second word; the third word, "Bigorre" -- B-I-G-O-R-R-E.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">01:49:13</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: Now how did the authorities know that you were part of the party?</span> <span id="s386">You said you were taken to this assigned community.</span> <span id="s387">But you had walked out of camp illegally.</span> <span id="s388">How did anyone know you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: When we...when I came to Luchon, I had to regularize my situation in Luchon with the authorities there.</span> <span id="s390">To them, I told them that I just came from Belgium.</span> <span id="s391">They didn't know that I came -- there was, in those days, there is a Hebrew word right in Genesis, and it speaks about tohoo va-vohoo.</span> <span id="s392">This was tohoo va-vohoo.</span> <span id="s393">You know the expression?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">9 Chaos, disorder (Hebrew).</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: It was utter turmoil.</span> <span id="s397">So when I came to Bagnères-de-Luchon, these relatives, distant relatives who had already established themselves with, with the temporary permit of residence took me to the, to the city hall.</span> <span id="s398">It was a police station.</span> <span id="s399">Well, this is a relative of us who just came from Belgium.</span> <span id="s400">He walked a lot and he -- that's why he's so late, and he stayed somewhere on the way.</span> <span id="s401">And I got these papers.</span> <span id="s402">I became -- I had to have these papers because of ration cards.</span> <span id="s403">I couldn't get ration cards unless I had this regularization of the situation involved in it.</span> <span id="s404">And I became just another one of the refugees in Luchon.</span> <span id="s405">You see these were not all Jewish refugees, although the majority were.</span> <span id="s406">But there were Frenchmen and Belgians there who just ran away from the war zone and finally wound up somewhere in the south of France because the south of France was then considered probably the furtherest and safest part.</span> <span id="s407">And then when the -- by the way, in the fall of that year we were also asked to sign up for work if we wanted to volunteer to do harvest, wine harvest, and we did that.</span> <span id="s408">Came back to Bagnères-de- Luchon, there we got a Laisser-passerfor that, a safe conduct that we could do that.</span> <span id="s409">The authorities wanted us to help the wine harvest.</span> <span id="s410">Why?</span> <span id="s411">Because we were the refugees that could fill in the labor force.</span> <span id="s412">Their men had been taken to the army.</span> <span id="s413">Their French men were in -- had been inducted into the army since 1939.</span> <span id="s414">So they needed agricultural help and that's what we did.</span> <span id="s415">We came back to Bagnères-de-Luchon.</span> <span id="s416">We were paid in, in food.</span> <span id="s417">We were not paid in money, but we got eggs and chickens and wine and cheese and butter to take back with us, which were commodities that were probably better than money.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">01:52:18</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: What was it like for a Jew in Bagnères-de-Luchon?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: As a community of, of Jews, we, we, we were a support system of each other, supporting of each other.</span> <span id="s421">The majority had come from northern France and Belgium, and the majority of people knew each other.</span> <span id="s422">Families, friends had fled together.</span> <span id="s423">Some of them came by car.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Very few, but some of them did come by car, brought even dogs with them.</span> <span id="s425">And it was somewhat regularized.</span> <span id="s426">Bagnères-de-Luchon, the name indicating a thermal spa, had a pavilion like those places do have and for the Jewish holidays, the Jews got together and had services.</span> <span id="s427">One of the Cantors by the name of Kreistein, and you may remember why I remember his name.</span> <span id="s428">It so happens he is from Vienna and in the district where I lived.</span> <span id="s429">I once sang with his choir as a boy.</span> <span id="s430">And Cantor Kreistein, a very diminutive man, and I say very, because you can be five foot six, that makes you five foot five diminutive, but he was probably was like close to five foot, but the voice of an angel, a very high pitched soprano voice.</span> <span id="s431">Kreistein was leading the congregation there, and we had services.</span> <span id="s432">But shortly thereafter, after the services, then came wintertime, and we spent the winter in Luchon which is heavy winters.</span> <span id="s433">There's snow in these mountains.</span> <span id="s434">Right after that, after that in early 41, we received notification that we will have to move to Bagnères-de-Bigorre, giving us safe conduct to go to Bagnères, we had two weeks to do it: go to Bagnères, look for lodging, look for a place to live, and then make arrangements to transfer to that locale.</span> <span id="s435">Mr. Frajermauer, the father, he and one of his brothers went there, looked for a place, and found a nice place, 10 “Admit bearer” (French).</span></p> <p><span id="s436">right at the border of the Adour River, and the place was called Villa Susanne.</span> <span id="s437">Villa Susanne.</span> <span id="s438">It was available.</span> <span id="s439">People come there on vacation and rent places for vacation during the summer.</span> <span id="s440">Well, the owner of Villa Susanne was very glad to rent that, that facility out in January or February for a, for an unlimited time almost because we didn't know how long we were going to be there.</span> <span id="s441">But it wasn't just renting for a month or two months.</span> <span id="s442">We did, we did move, took our belongs, drove by, we rented a camion,a truck, and the whole family, Frajermauer and me including.</span> <span id="s443">I was included -- and that's not good to say “Me included.”</span> <span id="s444">And we went to Bagnères-de-Bigorre and had a very -- some of the things I can really smile because they evoke more pleasant memories.</span> <span id="s445">It was just we moved from one town to another.</span> <span id="s446">In fact we moved from a small town, more confined and less accessible, to a town that was a little freer in access.</span> <span id="s447">That was 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: Let's hold it right there.</span> <span id="s449">We need to make a tape change.</span> <span id="s450">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">01:56:20 End of Tape 1</span></p> <p><span id="s452">11 Truck (French).</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s454">02:00:15</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: Pick up now please.</span> <span id="s456">You are in Bagnères-de-Bigorre.</span> <span id="s457">Tell us what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: Bagnères-de-Bigorre, from 1941 to 1942 was a little bit of a, a spot of light, as I recall the whole period.</span> <span id="s459">Because we, although we were registering, under the law, under the new Vichy laws, we, we moved freely within, within the confines.</span> <span id="s460">We went to the movie theatre.</span> <span id="s461">We took excursions into the mountains.</span> <span id="s462">I remember some mornings with the weather being right and nice and refreshing in the mountains.</span> <span id="s463">We got up early, five o'clock, and by six o'clock, we were up on a slope and picked blueberries that we brought back and made jams and, and, fruit juices out of and we used them and we ate them.</span> <span id="s464">We went out and picked fruit and, and, and we raised rabbits in that Villa Suzanne.</span> <span id="s465">Food was hard to come by because we had ration cards.</span> <span id="s466">Periodically, we would have to stand in line because they were rationing everything, even tripes, even liver, even marrow bones.</span> <span id="s467">You had to give a ticket for a marrow bone, but then you forego, a marrow bone was something with which you could do, make a good soup, but you may have to forego five ounces of meat which may not have the same impact on your, on your, on your, what you're preparing for, for dinner, you see.</span> <span id="s468">You have to trade one with the -- against the other.</span> <span id="s469">It was a, a fairly regulated type of life, other than having to go to the authorities and register periodically under the Jewish laws.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: You registered with the Vichy French?</span> <span id="s471">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: What kind of police presence was there?</span> <span id="s473">What kind of Vichy presence was there?</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: In that town, there was the police station, the police department, the police chief, the police in France -- or what you might call the gendarmes.The gendarmes is like state police.</span> <span id="s475">They are an arm of the government.</span> <span id="s476">They do what has to be done to keep law and order.</span> <span id="s477">But there was another arm.</span> <span id="s478">That was the political arm.</span> <span id="s479">The Vichy arm.</span> <span id="s480">That was called the “Milice,” the Militia.</span> <span id="s481">They wore their special uniforms, the black uniforms.</span> <span id="s482">The police wore their police uniforms.</span> <span id="s483">And they were out there to go along with the Vichy government law bent on pleasing and collaborating with the Germans.</span> <span id="s484">This was the treacherous element.</span> <span id="s485">The presence of the Milice in Bigorre, Bagnères-de-Bigorre, was minute.</span> <span id="s486">They knew they had a group of Jewish people there, maybe a thousand, fifteen hundred.</span> <span id="s487">They couldn't go anywhere without a Laisser-passer permit from the police.</span> <span id="s488">Therefore, the con game was on.</span> <span id="s489">We felt comfortable.</span> <span id="s490">We could go to a movie theatre if we wanted to.</span> <span id="s491">We could go to a restaurant if we wanted to.</span> <span id="s492">We could circulate.</span> <span id="s493">We could buy newspapers; and if we had to go to Tarbes, Bigorre, which was the Prefecture -- that was the seat of the Hautes-Pyrénées, that 12 Soldiery of the police militia (French).</span></p> <p><span id="s494">13 Militia (French).</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Department Hautes-Pyrénées, we would get to regularize something or two, or ask for whatever, paper, have to travel to a consulate somewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">02:04:22 We got these permits, these Laisser-passer, and it was really a game of psychology that was played constantly to make the people feel as comfortable, as safe, to ease their mind as to what the future might bring in, in more drastic measures, and like all the other population, the native indigent population of Bagnères, we stood in line with them for, for meat and food and, and anything else, clothing even.</span> <span id="s497">There was, was no difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: How did you eat?</span> <span id="s499">You wore a star?</span> <span id="s500">A: Not there.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: Not there.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: The first time I wore a star was in Drancy later.</span> <span id="s503">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: And 'Juif’was never worn in the Vichy area.</span> <span id="s505">Only in the occupied area north of the Demarcation Line.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: When did it no longer become safe in Bagnères?</span> <span id="s507">02:06:08</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: In -- at the end of 1941, just before the end of 1941.</span> <span id="s509">Sometime in the fall, we were told that we would have to make preparations towards moving to another assigned residence and that was Cauterets--C-A-U-T-E-R-E-T-S.</span> <span id="s510">Also in the same Department, Pyrénées, Hautes- Pyrénées.</span> <span id="s511">It so happens that at the time in 1941, during the summer and the early fall, I had received my papers from the United States, affidavit, an affidavit to come to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: How?</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: My aunt had sent me those papers into Vichy, France.</span> <span id="s514">I had actually received them earlier already in the beginning, but , but it took a while to process papers before you could come to the United States.</span> <span id="s515">I was on a waiting quota.</span> <span id="s516">And it was sometime in the fall -- no, it was actually around the time of Pearl Harbor that I was supposed to get my visa.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">14 Jew (French).</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: Your aunt arranged all this?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: Yeah, in, in, in, my aunt from Baltimore.</span> <span id="s520">She had already earlier brought an uncle, two uncles and two aunts, a brother and sister here with their respective mates.</span> <span id="s521">But when I went to the consulate, that was on that day of Pearl Harbor.</span> <span id="s522">There was no more processing of documents.</span> <span id="s523">So my affidavit to come to the United States fell by the wayside.</span> <span id="s524">It expired.</span> <span id="s525">So that later after the war, after I had survived, I got fresh papers.</span> <span id="s526">But in Bagnères, we were notified that we would have to move to Cauterets.</span> <span id="s527">And we moved to Cauterets sometime after the first of the year early in '42, probably in the springtime of '42.</span> <span id="s528">Again, the two men went there ahead of time and picked a place for us to live.</span> <span id="s529">And that place was called La Pergola.</span> <span id="s530">And also the little house, they name the houses in Europe.</span> <span id="s531">You know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">02:08:57 Call them one thing or another.</span> <span id="s533">A name or a tree.</span> <span id="s534">The Lindenhouse (ph) or something like that.</span> <span id="s535">When we went to Cauterets, we, at that point, frankly, we felt confined.</span> <span id="s536">For the first time since Luchon and Bagnères, Cauterets too was a thermal spot.</span> <span id="s537">A lot of, about 1500 inhabitants during the year, but during the summer season, it, it could rise to about maybe 10,000.</span> <span id="s538">Thermal spa.</span> <span id="s539">There were about a thousand or 1500 of us sent into that town into forced residence.</span> <span id="s540">It was called residence assignee.</span> <span id="s541">We called it "Résidence Forcée.”</span> <span id="s542">Even for those people who do not speak French, I think “Assignée”speaks for itself.</span> <span id="s543">Well, again we tried to make the best of life.</span> <span id="s544">And we did excursions into the mountains to pass the time, and we gathered and listened to the radio.</span> <span id="s545">Of course, by that time some of the listening of the Radio, Radio London was prohibited, but we still heard it.</span> <span id="s546">Bumm, bumm, bummm, You familiar with that?</span> <span id="s547">The first bars of the Fifth Symphony.</span> <span id="s548">"Ici Radio Londres.”</span> <span id="s549">This is the Free French.</span> <span id="s550">Near the Spanish border.</span> <span id="s551">Hardly a mile or two from the Spanish border.</span> <span id="s552">When we went into a little excursion in the morning, again recognize let's go up in the mountain, make a little picnic or that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s553">This was all to pass the time as pleasantly as we could, because if you were sitting there worrying about when will the Milice come and when will things change, you could really fall into such doldrums and such despair and depression that you wouldn't even be able to think straight anymore.</span> <span id="s554">And life is life while it's going on.</span> <span id="s555">There's just, there's just not enough impetus to, to, to make you think of the most dire circumstances, because you have a mountain surrounding you and you have friends with you and, and you wake up in the morning and you hope for the next day.</span> <span id="s556">But there's not that immediate threat hanging over you.</span> <span id="s557">So you make the best of life and you say “Hopefully, this will end soon.”</span> <span id="s558">Radio London gave us a little hope -- a note from here, from there would filter through that the resistance is starting to, to, to jell you know.</span> <span id="s559">And it was not until the fall, something in September, that the Mayor of that town sent the word out to us, the Jews, that within a day or two, they expect a raid by the Milice and the Gestapo.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">15 Forced Residence (French).</span></p> <p><span id="s561">16 Assigned (French).</span></p> <p><span id="s562">17 Here is Radio London (French).</span></p> <p><span id="s563">02:12:38</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: Okay, let's pick it up.</span> <span id="s565">The mayor, tell us about the mayor.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: We never met the mayor.</span> <span id="s567">But what he did at the time was a great thing.</span> <span id="s568">He notified us and left it up to us to do what, he wasn't going to say, “I am going to put a train at your disposal and send you all out of here or trucks” or something.</span> <span id="s569">Do what you can.</span> <span id="s570">I just want you to know that this place is no longer safe for you.</span> <span id="s571">A handful of us took to the mountains, in fact, and we stayed a couple of days and couple of nights up in the mountains.</span> <span id="s572">Periodically sending someone down.</span> <span id="s573">Once I went down, then somebody else, to find out what's going on.</span> <span id="s574">The first few hours nothing had changed in town and the people were still there, although very apprehensive.</span> <span id="s575">By that time, the mood had drastically changed.</span> <span id="s576">The parents had to console their kids.</span> <span id="s577">They had to tell them, “We may leave.”</span> <span id="s578">They started packing.</span> <span id="s579">Some of us, as I said, took to the mountains, a handful.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: The rest stayed?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: Stayed!</span> <span id="s582">Two days later when finally the messenger that we had sent out came back and said, "It's finished.</span> <span id="s583">They were there.</span> <span id="s584">Most people are gone."</span> <span id="s585">That's when we came back from the mountains.</span> <span id="s586">In fact, the message was that when I knew they were going down to the mountains, "Go over the to Frajermauers and see if they are still there."</span> <span id="s587">Low and behold, the Frajermauers were still there.</span> <span id="s588">They had Belgian documentations.</span> <span id="s589">Those who apatrides, means stateless, Polish, German, Austrian, were taken.</span> <span id="s590">Those who had French, Belgian, and Luxembourg nationality were left.</span> <span id="s591">Another psychological ploy to tell them, "You are safe."</span> <span id="s592">In the final analysis, no one was.</span> <span id="s593">Because when you look at the book of the Klarsfelds, many people do not know that, but there were Americans and Swiss and Finns and Swedes and Norwegians who were Jews deported from Drancy.</span> <span id="s594">Those passports didn't matter at all to the Germans.</span> <span id="s595">But the ploy was there at this particular point.</span> <span id="s596">When you look back at this whole period -- the Nazi period, the deportations -- you see one psychological aspect of the progress of that dehumanization after the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: You are in the mountains caught in the middle of this.</span> <span id="s598">You are about to come down to Bigorre.</span> <span id="s599">What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">02:16:25</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: I went right to La Pergola, saw the Frajermauers.</span> <span id="s602">They said, "You know, we are here because we are Belgians, but we don't know how long."</span> <span id="s603">In fact, they were not Belgians.</span> <span id="s604">The children were, the two daughters.</span> <span id="s605">That's why they left the family with them.</span> <span id="s606">“But you cannot stay here.”</span> <span id="s607">“But let's wait and see what we can think about.”</span> <span id="s608">I went up to the attic and hid in 18 Without nationality, stateless (French).</span></p> <p><span id="s609">19 Serge and Beate Klarsfeld.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">the attic.</span> <span id="s611">There was a room up there with a cot, a cot that had no sheets or anything, just a small mattress on it and some storage, a storage room it was mainly -- and there were suitcases and all kinds of discarded objects that weren't even ours.</span> <span id="s612">They were, these were of the owner of, of the, the building and I hid up there for two days and two nights.</span> <span id="s613">The door was not a regular door, but it was slats of wood and you could peep between the slats and it had a padlock on the outside.</span> <span id="s614">My distant cousin, Anny, the daughter of Mr. Frajermauer, locked me in.</span> <span id="s615">And the next morning I hear footsteps coming up, and I peep through that thing to that crack and I see two gendarmes, not Milice, local gendarmes from the police, come up with Anny and I hear them ask her, "Who has the key to that lock?"</span> <span id="s616">And there she is, and I peeped and then I stood sideways so that they shouldn't notice, and I had to be very careful not to move or make any crackling noise.</span> <span id="s617">You know these, these wooden planks, they can easily give you away.</span> <span id="s618">And I hear her say, "We don't store anything up here.</span> <span id="s619">We don't even have the key for this, but if you want to break it open, go ahead and do it."</span> <span id="s620">And I hear him say to her, "You know where your friend is still, don't you?"</span> <span id="s621">Because they knew there was another person living under that address because we had to register with the police here, just like we did in Bagnères-de-Bigorre.</span> <span id="s622">That was the idea of a assigned residence, where you would register periodically so that they know you have not left this assigned residence.</span> <span id="s623">There was a law against leaving this assigned residence.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">02:19:20 And she said, "We don't even have the key."</span> <span id="s625">And I have never talked about that because that's something so private, but I guess eventually that has to be brought up, too.</span> <span id="s626">And by the time this is shown, well, the person herself will not be aware of it, but it has to be, it has to be told, I think.</span> <span id="s627">And he said, "The only way I will not try to break that lock open if you kiss me" to the girl.</span> <span id="s628">That was 1942.</span> <span id="s629">She was 20 years old.</span> <span id="s630">A 20-year old distant cousin of mine.</span> <span id="s631">In fact, I liked the girl.</span> <span id="s632">"If you kiss me."</span> <span id="s633">And she said, "No, don't ask me to do that"--"Ne demandez ça pas, ne me demandez pas faire ça."</span> <span id="s634">"Well, then I'll break the lock open."</span> <span id="s635">She says, "Well, go ahead and do it."</span> <span id="s636">She didn't want him to, to give away that there is somebody in there.</span> <span id="s637">He said, "Well, I guess you are right.</span> <span id="s638">I guess you are not lying to me."</span> <span id="s639">But regardless, he grabbed her and kissed her and lifted her skirt and tried to molest her, tried to have sex with her.</span> <span id="s640">The second gendarme said to him -- and I hear all this -- "Leave that girl alone and let's go."</span> <span id="s641">That's when he let go of her.</span> <span id="s642">And they all three went down.</span> <span id="s643">And I stayed up there another night.</span> <span id="s644">And then when they came back to tell me that it's time for me to get out of there, I am pretty safe, one evening, I kissed Anny and I said, "You almost got raped on account of me."</span> <span id="s645">She says, "I had to save you.</span> <span id="s646">I had to save you."</span> <span id="s647">"If I had to do it," she says, "I'll just have to do it.</span> <span id="s648">I didn't want them to get into that attic."</span> <span id="s649">She lives today in Antwerp.</span> <span id="s650">She has a family.</span> <span id="s651">An evening later -- the same evening, actually, because I couldn't stay another day--I left on foot from Cauterets at night.</span> <span id="s652">I had taken a rucksack, belongings, left on foot from Cauterets.</span> <span id="s653">Guess where I went to.</span> <span id="s654">Bagnères-de-Bigorre.</span> <span id="s655">Back to Bagnères- de-Bigorre.</span> <span id="s656">Why?</span> <span id="s657">I knew a family there that had remained there.</span> <span id="s658">The family Spira, S-P-I-R- Their daughter today lives in Kew Gardens, New York; and we visit periodically.</span> <span id="s659">And another daughter lives in Israel.</span> <span id="s660">Susie in New York and Recha in Israel.</span> <span id="s661">I went, left at night, heading toward Bagnères-de-Bigorre.</span> <span id="s662">I walked all night.</span> <span id="s663">I went through Lourdes.</span> <span id="s664">That's in that same area, slept under a tree during that night, resting up, next day during the day, I went to the Spira's, made contact with them and spent with them several weeks, all the time trying to secure a false identification so that I should escape to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s665">Living with the Spira's, I lived in hiding.</span> <span id="s666">I didn't go out.</span> <span id="s667">Maybe, no, I never went out at all at that particular point.</span> <span id="s668">The father went out to do the shopping and the marketing and everything else, bread and stand in line.</span> <span id="s669">Mr. Spira, Max Spira -- Mendel Spira, actually.</span> <span id="s670">And I stayed with these friends for several weeks, maybe five or six weeks.</span> <span id="s671">At one time, we feared a police raid into the house to just check out.</span> <span id="s672">It was during the night and the two girls and I slept in the, the two daughters and I were in the attic, slept in the same room.</span> <span id="s673">I on a, bedded out on the floor, and the girls on the bed, and at that point when we heard the noises, Susie just recently reminded me, "Leo, remember what you did when you, when that noise came?"</span> <span id="s674">I said, "No.</span> <span id="s675">No.</span> <span id="s676">I must have been hiding somewhere."</span> <span id="s677">She said, "You opened the window and you walked out on the roof."</span> <span id="s678">She said, "Do you remember when one morning you woke up and next to you there was a dead rat."</span> <span id="s679">I said, "Yes, I do.</span> <span id="s680">How did that happen?"</span> <span id="s681">She said, "Well, in the middle of the night, you remember, we heard that noise and something on you and you started banging and banging and you had killed a rat."</span> <span id="s682">That was right next to me.</span> <span id="s683">She brought back these things to me and I said, "Wait a minute, Leo, you went through some things that today, you wouldn't even believe you could have done it."</span> <span id="s684">They were good people, the Spira's.</span> <span id="s685">They harbored me.</span> <span id="s686">We remained friends for a long time.</span> <span id="s687">Still are, with the daughter and I in New York.</span> <span id="s688">But when I had, finally had my false ID papers,</span></p> <p><span id="s689">02:25:49</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: How did you get them?</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: Mr. Spira knew a person in town who was connected with an underground situation.</span> <span id="s692">And they procured these papers for me, for some other people, including a friend who was part of that distant family by the name of Albert Herszkowitz.He later was deported in the same train that I was in.</span> <span id="s693">And we made our way to the Swiss border, having already through that contact with the cards, found out whom to contact near the Swiss border, near Évian-les- Bains.</span> <span id="s694">A farmer's family, the son had smuggled, a young man in his 20s, had smuggled people into Switzerland.</span> <span id="s695">We arrived in Évian-les-Bains, looked for the address.</span> <span id="s696">In fact, he picked up us up at the, at the railroad station, because we had notified him so that he, should directly come to his farm, spent a couple of days on his farm, and two days later, he took us up into the mountains to right to the Swiss border in the mountains.</span> <span id="s697">We walked some 40 some hours there or maybe even more.</span> <span id="s698">Heavy shoes.</span> <span id="s699">We spent one night in the mountains, sleeping on a, sort of an incline, a slope and that night, that was in October 1942, and that night a light snow fell.</span> <span id="s700">When we woke up we were covered with sort of a rime of icy stuff.</span> <span id="s701">Next morning we crossed into Switzerland.</span> <span id="s702">This man had instructed us, this young man.</span> <span id="s703">In fact, he left us up there, five of us.</span> <span id="s704">Went back to his house.</span> <span id="s705">He says, "All you have to do is 20 The interviewee notes that various spellings of this name occur in several records: In one, Albert is listed as Abram Herskovicz.</span> <span id="s706">In another, Albert’s brother Mordka had been recorded as Herzkowicz.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">just cross this thing.</span> <span id="s708">You are at the border."</span> <span id="s709">From here on in, we are on our own, simply because he as a Frenchman doesn't want to be caught be a Swiss being a smuggler.</span> <span id="s710">He would be arrested.</span> <span id="s711">He took us to, we paid for that.</span> <span id="s712">We crossed into Switzerland and we had been no longer than 10 minutes walking on the Swiss side towards the valley, we knew.</span> <span id="s713">It goes down and it goes into the valley.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">02:28:39 When the path goes down constantly in a little serpentine, we go into the valley.</span> <span id="s715">That stands to reason.</span> <span id="s716">Before we could even reach half point, we had gone maybe 10 or 15 minutes, the Swiss border police, they wear these big hats.</span> <span id="s717">They look like scout hats.</span> <span id="s718">Like the Canadians some -- wear the Mounties, similar -- and shepherd dogs.</span> <span id="s719">So the dogs started standing up, and he gave them some command or whatever that is.</span> <span id="s720">The dog listens to these commands evidently, and we knew that if we were attempting anything like running or anything else, but who would run in Switzerland?</span> <span id="s721">After all, we are in free Switzerland.</span> <span id="s722">We are in neutral territory.</span> <span id="s723">We had heard that they had taken in German deserters and, and, fliers that had been shot down or had been on mission over France and had to -- and were shot down and made it to the border and were accepted in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s724">Why run from a Swiss?</span> <span id="s725">We were coming to them and said, "Hello, we are here.</span> <span id="s726">Here we are.</span> <span id="s727">Now we are in your country -- a free country, right?"</span> <span id="s728">Wrong.</span> <span id="s729">We were taken down into the valley into a little town called St.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Gingolph which is a border town.</span> <span id="s731">Half of the town is French and half of it is Swiss.</span> <span id="s732">On the Swiss side, it so happens the cemetery is located.</span> <span id="s733">So when somebody dies on the French side, they got to take him across the border, aboard the border post.</span> <span id="s734">They lift the border post -- they inspect coffins even, to see that there is no contraband.</span> <span id="s735">At least in those days, they did.</span> <span id="s736">Now maybe that's eased up.</span> <span id="s737">St. Gingolph -- G-I-N-G-O-L-P-H.</span> <span id="s738">Exactly across from Montreux, which is in Switzerland on the other side of the lake, Lác Leman.</span> <span id="s739">That's the Lake of Geneva.</span> <span id="s740">But we were in Switzerland, in the Swiss part of St. Gingolph, taken to a police office.</span> <span id="s741">And there is a captain.</span> <span id="s742">And this captain was a rock.</span> <span id="s743">A cold rock.</span> <span id="s744">A stone.</span> <span id="s745">He had eyes and he had a nose and he had a mouth, but he had no feelings.</span> <span id="s746">We cried.</span> <span id="s747">We begged.</span> <span id="s748">We tried to take his hand and kiss his hand.</span> <span id="s749">We were young kids.</span> <span id="s750">We kneeled.</span> <span id="s751">You name it.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Everything bureaucratic.</span> <span id="s753">"How did you get over?</span> <span id="s754">Who helped you?"</span> <span id="s755">"Nobody!"</span> <span id="s756">All these inquiries.</span> <span id="s757">"How did you make it up here?</span> <span id="s758">How -- how did you get there?</span> <span id="s759">Where did you originate?"</span> <span id="s760">"Well, we came from Évian and walked across."</span> <span id="s761">"Who showed you the way?"</span> <span id="s762">"Nobody!</span> <span id="s763">We were in these mountains for days."</span> <span id="s764">We didn't have to tell him it was just a night or two.</span> <span id="s765">Nothing doing.</span> <span id="s766">Enough.</span> <span id="s767">In effect, I know the words that we said.</span> <span id="s768">We said in as many words that we would like to stay here until the end of the war in one of your camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">We know you have camps for internees, refugees, just to work and for food.</span> <span id="s770">We don't need pay.</span> <span id="s771">All we want to know that we are there and can live, wait out the war.</span> <span id="s772">Not an emotion, nothing!</span> <span id="s773">Nothing at all!</span> <span id="s774">Just motions and, and, and very quick questions and bureaucracy.</span> <span id="s775">They sent us back to Vichy France.</span> <span id="s776">And the Vichy France gendarme took us over at the border post in St. Gingolph and brought us into the French gendarmerie,and we spent a night in their cells.</span> <span id="s777">I had taken my shoes off.</span> <span id="s778">I had high shoes.</span> <span id="s779">I had taken my shoes off.</span> <span id="s780">I 21 The total force of the gendarmes (French).</span></p> <p><span id="s781">had to peel my socks off my feet.</span> <span id="s782">I had bloody feet from walking in the mountains.</span> <span id="s783">I know I had because they hurt, and I know I had it because I could feel my socks sticking to the shoe and a couple of women were among them that were sent back, and my friend, Al Herszkowicz, Albert.</span> <span id="s784">And from there by train, we were taken to a camp whose name you have heard many, many times: Rivesaltes.</span> <span id="s785">I met some people recently here at a meeting in Washington.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">02:33:35 This woman, she was in Rivesaltes; same experience from Switzerland.</span> <span id="s787">Her brother, her husband, and when she heard that I went out and talked about it in Columbia to a group on a Shoah exercises, she came up to me and she says, "You brought back a whole period of my life when you mentioned the word 'Rivesaltes'."</span> <span id="s788">Taken to Rivesaltes in October.</span> <span id="s789">Separated women from men.</span> <span id="s790">Also again, Polish, German, group from -- Luxembourgers.</span> <span id="s791">Milly Cahen, a friend, the young lady whom I had befriended in the train from Switzerland to Rivesaltes, she was in, in an adjoining section of the camp and we spoke across the barbed wire.</span> <span id="s792">Later when I went to Europe with my family and we visited Luxembourg, and we went to visit her husband.</span> <span id="s793">I hadn't known that, but Milly just a few weeks earlier had been killed in an automobile accident.</span> <span id="s794">Never got to saw Milly again.</span> <span id="s795">A bright young person.</span> <span id="s796">Her husband, very saddened, told me that she had just had that violent death.</span> <span id="s797">Anyway, from Rivesaltes, after a few weeks -- well, not so many few weeks; just a couple of weeks, we were taken to Drancy.</span> <span id="s798">Now in Rivesaltes -- again, I didn't go to Drancy just because they wanted me to go to Drancy.</span> <span id="s799">I was hiding out in the camp.</span> <span id="s800">Yes, again.</span> <span id="s801">"Where will you hid out?"</span> <span id="s802">they said.</span> <span id="s803">I said, "Well, let me try."</span> <span id="s804">Barracks have a ceiling, but there is a triangular roof; something that looks triangle where you have an ungulated roof going this way and that way.</span> <span id="s805">And between that peak and the barrack, there is a -- is it plywood or plaster board ceiling?</span> <span id="s806">I climbed up there and lay down on that flat with my rucksack.</span> <span id="s807">I had to have that with me.</span> <span id="s808">Somehow that's, this was my apartment.</span> <span id="s809">This was my life.</span> <span id="s810">That's what I had to hold on to.</span> <span id="s811">If I didn't have that, I didn't have anything anymore, you see.</span> <span id="s812">This was ludicrous, really, in hindsight, because you only carry or shleparound things that you don't need.</span> <span id="s813">But you hold on to things.</span> <span id="s814">I was lying up there and hearing them go and count.</span> <span id="s815">And I was missing.</span> <span id="s816">My name wasn't, I wasn't there.</span> <span id="s817">I wasn't in the barrack when we checked in the evening.</span> <span id="s818">We were checked in, in the evening as to presence.</span> <span id="s819">In the morning I wasn't there.</span> <span id="s820">And I hear them talk: "Oú est tu?</span> <span id="s821">Ne cachez pas."</span> <span id="s822">--"Where are you?</span> <span id="s823">Don't hide.</span> <span id="s824">It won't work."</span> <span id="s825">--"Ça ne marchera pas."</span> <span id="s826">"We know where you are."</span> <span id="s827">--"Nous savons oú vous êtes."</span> <span id="s828">"Tu est"--They don't "vouvoi" you, they "toutoi”you.</span> <span id="s829">And there I am trying not to breathe even because I felt if I, breathing maybe, But unfortunately, and I could have expected it, should have probably, some of that plaster board started falling down and it fell down from there you know, and I really heard it trickle down like…</span></p> <p><span id="s830">02:37:17 22 Jerk, drag (Yiddish).</span></p> <p><span id="s831">23 Interviewee explains that the polite or formal plural, “voivou,” wasn’t used.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">And so they came in the area and said, "We know you are up there.</span> <span id="s833">Why don't you just come down and make it easier."</span> <span id="s834">I didn't get punished or anything.</span> <span id="s835">I climbed down, climbed down and they said, "You tried, but it just didn't work."</span> <span id="s836">To them it didn't really matter, because to them people came and went constantly.</span> <span id="s837">This was just another transport they had to do, and they wanted to just numerically have the right amount of people and to know that nobody had escaped, because that would reflect on their efficiency.</span> <span id="s838">So when they have x amount of people to take and count it in the barracks the night before and the next day these people have to be transported, so that number better be the same number that you counted the night before.</span> <span id="s839">That's all they were concerned with.</span> <span id="s840">Not the punishing me with -- if they had punished me and put me in a brig, I would have preferred that because my deportation would have been delayed.</span> <span id="s841">But that's not the case.</span> <span id="s842">They took us to the train and took us to Drancy on the 20 or the 22nd of October.</span> <span id="s843">We were taken by transport -- passenger train, not cattle cars.</span> <span id="s844">Another ploy to make us feel are we going to camp so, by that time all of us had been used to camps and those situations so much, that another camp was just a continuation of -- an expected situation.</span> <span id="s845">So Drancy -- by that time, we in the south had heard of Drancy but did not quite realize the immensity of the camp and the tragedy involved in that preparation toward deportation.</span> <span id="s846">It took us a day to get up there.</span> <span id="s847">We arrived in Drancy.</span> <span id="s848">Again in that train, several times going to the wash room, I looked at the situation over.</span> <span id="s849">Escape was always on my mind.</span> <span id="s850">Maybe this is the, the deep urge to live and, and experience.</span> <span id="s851">But there was no, there was no getting away from that bathroom because the gendarmes stood right in front of the door when somebody went to the bathroom.</span> <span id="s852">They were in the car with us.</span> <span id="s853">It was not like the gendarmes were riding in another car ahead, or in the back so that they should be there in case of emergency.</span> <span id="s854">They were with us in the train.</span> <span id="s855">And you know how the French trains are, were at that time anyway.</span> <span id="s856">Each compartment had their own door to walk in, so was no use trying it there and again, let's wait until the next camp and see what we can do later.</span> <span id="s857">We arrived in Drancy and checked in.</span> <span id="s858">The checking-in process in Drancy was, well, a first step in a, in a real dehumanization process.</span> <span id="s859">Number one, when we arrived there, the faces that we saw, the, the eyes with queries in them and, and a lot of questions, "Where are you coming from?</span> <span id="s860">How is outside?</span> <span id="s861">What did you, what do you think?</span> <span id="s862">What news do you have?"</span></p> <p><span id="s863">02:40:38 Everybody gathering about a new group of arrivals because they may, they may have something to convey and we went through a barrack process of checking in which would also mean taking your watch away, your rings, certain belongings, money.</span> <span id="s864">And another psychological ploy: giving you a receipt for the things that they took from you, with the admonition, "Don't lose that!"</span> <span id="s865">because you will never get them back.</span> <span id="s866">That is your receipt that has a number on it.</span> <span id="s867">It had a number on it.</span> <span id="s868">Just imagine that!</span> <span id="s869">And people there tried to sort of whisper to us that this isn't good here.</span> <span id="s870">And we knew, as we came in, the mood immediately, it wasn't Rivesaltes any longer.</span> <span id="s871">It was not Rivesaltes by any stretch of the imagination.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Drancy was a complex that was built to be a military barracks facility.</span> <span id="s873">It was a multi-story complex almost like a stadium because it was round.</span> <span id="s874">But due to the war, beginning of the war, that building, that structure, was never finished.</span> <span id="s875">So the places, the rooms that they put us in were wide open, concrete floor with piping laying around and half-installed electrical wires, half-installed plumbing, makeshift, and it was concrete.</span> <span id="s876">Windows -- no, no windows, There were no panes in the windows.</span> <span id="s877">It was just the opening where the windows were supposed to go in the frames later.</span> <span id="s878">That wasn't done so it was all open, breezy.</span> <span id="s879">And on this concrete, straw.</span> <span id="s880">Men, women, children together.</span> <span id="s881">Minimal facilities to wash.</span> <span id="s882">Community, one trough like, where you, where the water ran down from in trickle.</span> <span id="s883">Minimum toilet facilities.</span> <span id="s884">Watchtowers.</span> <span id="s885">Barbed wire.</span> <span id="s886">Suburb of Paris close to quote “civilization.”</span> <span id="s887">Minimal food distribution.</span> <span id="s888">That's where we were issued the Jewish star.</span> <span id="s889">This is where we had to wear it.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">The population in northern France and the occupied zone had to wear that already in the towns, streets, everywhere.</span> <span id="s891">But we having just arrived in Drancy had to put that on because this was the administration of the German authorities.</span> <span id="s892">"Juif" --- French for "Jew."</span> <span id="s893">In Holland, it was "Jood;" in Germany, "Jude."</span> <span id="s894">I cannot fail to mention that, because I always mention that.</span> <span id="s895">And it has to be mentioned over and over and over again, that the German propaganda told you that a Jew, you can smell them a mile away.</span> <span id="s896">A Jew, you know when you see a Jew, from a distance, you can smell him, you see his actions, you see, there's no way where you can mistake a Jew for what he is.</span> <span id="s897">So the obvious thing, question is, it's a rhetorical question and even young children to whom I speak periodically in a museum or in school when I ask that and I say, so what is your next question then.</span> <span id="s898">And they would say, "So why did you need that star?"</span> <span id="s899">And some young people, eight, nine year old, says, "I know why."</span> <span id="s900">I said, "Tell me."</span> <span id="s901">He says, "To humiliate you."</span> <span id="s902">And for a child that's a big statement.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">He understands that.</span> <span id="s904">So we had this star and we were easily recognizable, yet we had to wear it.</span> <span id="s905">So that destroys their whole thesis, their whole propaganda, and their propaganda can be destroyed in thousands of ways because nothing ever made sense.</span> <span id="s906">It only dwelt on the, on the, on the emotions.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">02:45:43</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q: Go back to Drancy.</span> <span id="s909">So you were in this camp.</span> <span id="s910">What happened in Drancy?</span> <span id="s911">What did you do?</span> <span id="s912">A: We saw utter despair, uncertainty, acts of, of aggression, pushing, shoving, end of rifle butts, and threats.</span> <span id="s913">And it wasn't until I saw a newborn baby being shot like a clay pigeon, and the mother being killed too because she threw herself into the path of the bullet, that I spoke to my friend, Manfred Silberwasser.</span> <span id="s914">And I said, "Manfred, if this can happen in Drancy, what can we expect where we're going to?</span> <span id="s915">This is France.</span> <span id="s916">This is not yet Germany."</span> <span id="s917">There was no question of Auschwitz yet, because Auschwitz, the rumors that had come back to us were, were we didn't even want to think about that.</span> <span id="s918">We didn't even want to believe that, that that was possible.</span> <span id="s919">But this was November 1942; and in January 1942, the, the, the Wannsee Conference had decided on the Final Solution of which the news had only trickled down to us.</span> <span id="s920">And everybody was always suspicious, leery of that, that cannot happen, take people for thousands of miles to gas them to kill them and then the -- always came back that there were always rumors in the First World War that turned out to be just that -- rumors.</span> <span id="s921">And I said, "Fred, what we hear about what's possible, how they're going to… And we must do something.</span> <span id="s922">Now if these are rumors and we prove to be wrong at the end of the war, then so be it.</span> <span id="s923">I would rather be wrong at the end of the war than not be prepared now to do something about this."</span> <span id="s924">They take your watch away, your toothbrush, glasses, eyeglasses.</span> <span id="s925">They would leave you the eyeglasses, but when somebody had very thick eyeglasses where it was very necessary for that person to carry to see your hand in front of your eyes, those they took away.</span> <span id="s926">That's the torture.</span> <span id="s927">Somebody that had two eyes that needed for reading glasses, they left them those.</span> <span id="s928">They were very selective as to how they moved that, that psychological ploy.</span> <span id="s929">And compacts.</span> <span id="s930">A compact to a woman and lipstick to a woman is, is something to hold onto.</span> <span id="s931">Her person is a person.</span> <span id="s932">Without that she is not fully a person.</span> <span id="s933">Or the same thing for a -- combs they took away from us, because they could be a weapon.</span> <span id="s934">But we didn't need it anyway.</span> <span id="s935">They shaved our hair.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Q: What did you do then?</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: Well, on the sixth of November.</span> <span id="s938">We had one sign while we were there of something hopeful when towards the beginning of November, the skywriters were flying overhead in the Paris sky and I also later witnessed bombardment.</span> <span id="s939">But these skywriters wrote "Le Huit,Le Huit, L-E H-U-I-T" which means "the eighth."</span> <span id="s940">And on the eighth of November, on a Sunday, November the eighth, the Allies landed in North Africa in 1942.</span> <span id="s941">So they were playing games with those things, but they just wanted to let the French population know that on the eighth, you can expect something.</span> <span id="s942">They had these little things going on periodically to encourage.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">Q: When did you know you were going on a transport?</span> <span id="s944">02:50:16</span></p> <p><span id="s945">A: The day before they took us.</span> <span id="s946">Q: Tell us about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">A: Thursday the fifth, in the morning, they notified us that we will be leaving.</span> <span id="s948">In the afternoon of the fifth, Thursday, took us to the train station of Drancy, to Le Bourget, in trucks.</span> <span id="s949">Again, we looked how we can jump off that truck, but that would have been of foolishness because the guards were right on there and anybody who would jump would be shot at.</span> <span id="s950">And people -- we, my friend and I, when I say “we,” had a, an advantage, namely that we were not with family.</span> <span id="s951">A husband would not jump off the truck and leave his wife and children there.</span> <span id="s952">That's for sure.</span> <span id="s953">Or a young child that is without parents will not try to run away because he or she was told that where you are going, you are going to meet your parents, and vice versa.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Parents were taken and were told where you are going you're going to meet your children.</span> <span id="s955">Because the kids were taken out of the school and brought in and the parents, again "tohoo va-vohoo."</span> <span id="s956">And we were taken to the train and put into the trains in the evening.</span> <span id="s957">Now it could have been 5:00, 6:00, or 7:00, somewhere around this time.</span> <span id="s958">November it gets dark early.</span> <span id="s959">It was a, a sort of a misty type northern France fall, raw day.</span> <span id="s960">Put into the trains at 50</span></p> <p><span id="s961">24 Eight (French).</span></p> <p><span id="s962">per cattle car.</span> <span id="s963">I understand from other people who were in the east, in those cases, they even had a hundred per cattle car.</span> <span id="s964">Fifty per cattle car which was bad enough of a, what I like to call, microcosm of humanity abandoned by the world.</span> <span id="s965">Everybody, old and young and from all professions, from all walks of life, from all economic strata, from every segment of the Jewish population.</span> <span id="s966">Children alone.</span> <span id="s967">Crippled people.</span> <span id="s968">People on stretchers.</span> <span id="s969">Counted out 50 per car.</span> <span id="s970">Now, Linda, imagine yourself in a situation where you and a husband and two children are at the end of rifle butts pushed into a cattle car, counted out, ", 48, 49, 50.</span> <span id="s971">In!"</span> <span id="s972">Fifty-one would have been the other child.</span> <span id="s973">This other child does not go with his parents and sibling into this car.</span> <span id="s974">This child is at this point separated and put into the next car, counted out as number one going into the next car.</span> <span id="s975">You might say they are separated by one car length but in fact they are separated by an ocean.</span> <span id="s976">They are worlds apart.</span> <span id="s977">And a good chance is -- a bad chance -- is that that child will never see the parents again, and the parents will never see that child again.</span> <span id="s978">And the trauma of that family is indescribable.</span> <span id="s979">I can say words; they are not answerable.</span> <span id="s980">I can express thoughts; they are unthinkable.</span> <span id="s981">Even to express them is almost a ludicrous endeavor.</span> <span id="s982">Dehumanization to the worst degree!</span></p> <p><span id="s983">02:54:01 End of Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s985">02:55:30</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Q: You're in the cattle car.</span> <span id="s987">The doors -- tell me what they did with the doors.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">A: They shut them closed, yeah.</span> <span id="s989">These sliding doors, they were closed shut.</span> <span id="s990">And from the outside, just latch-locked -- heavy metal latches.</span> <span id="s991">And that was in the evening.</span> <span id="s992">Now, the good thing would have been for this train to leave.</span> <span id="s993">But it didn't.</span> <span id="s994">It did not leave until next morning, about 12 hours later, 12 or 14 hours later, in the early morning.</span> <span id="s995">As I see the report in the Klarsfeld book, it was something like 8:05.</span> <span id="s996">Because there was a precise schedule.</span> <span id="s997">But to be all night in a waiting standing train is much more torture than being riding.</span> <span id="s998">When you are riding, you, you see progress, you see something is happening.</span> <span id="s999">Sitting there is like being the expression "sitting ducks."</span> <span id="s1000">And, of course, in that particular confinement you have a whole gamut of emotions running their course.</span> <span id="s1001">You have resignation, you have despair, openly expressed; a lot of crying, a lot of moaning, some praying.</span> <span id="s1002">A young man with a gangrenous leg and knee attempting to make love to a young woman in the train.</span> <span id="s1003">He did that in the camp, too.</span> <span id="s1004">Call that an expression of life.</span> <span id="s1005">Call it an expression of, perhaps, resignation of what else can happen.</span> <span id="s1006">Call it whatever you will.</span> <span id="s1007">It was an act, perhaps this was the, because perhaps this was the one human act that really happened there.</span> <span id="s1008">He didn't force that person.</span> <span id="s1009">She didn't cry or shout or resist.</span> <span id="s1010">But it points up that what happened in that train was, all privacy of a human being was, had been taken away.</span> <span id="s1011">There's no more privacy.</span> <span id="s1012">How can you, with one bucket in the center of that car, of that cattle car?</span> <span id="s1013">Everybody relieving themselves in that one bucket -- man, women, and children -- because you had to.</span> <span id="s1014">You had reached the common denominator of dehumanization.</span> <span id="s1015">There was no such thing as "I am a man, I can't show it," and, "I am a woman, I can't do that."</span> <span id="s1016">And people were still thinking that there was something of humaneness ahead of them.</span> <span id="s1017">We recently saw that film about one remembrance.</span> <span id="s1018">The one stark scene that I -- my family didn't want me to see that at all, and I only saw glimpses of it, like snitches of it.</span> <span id="s1019">But at the end, I saw that one scene where the woman open, stands in the open door of that cattle car confronted by the SS officer at the arrival in Auschwitz or Birkenau.</span> <span id="s1020">And she said to the person, "We have seven dead people in that car."</span> <span id="s1021">And he laughed and said, "Well, these are the lucky ones."</span> <span id="s1022">That points it all up.</span> <span id="s1023">That that woman speaking to this SS officer thought she was really confronting a human being who could understand this tragedy.</span> <span id="s1024">And this is why people throughout the transport were trying to talk us out of running away.</span> <span id="s1025">We had decided to make our getaway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">03:00:00</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">Q: Who is "we"?</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">A: My friend and I.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">Q: And you are still standing.</span> <span id="s1030">You had not yet began to move?</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">A: We hadn't moved.</span> <span id="s1032">We were squatting, standing.</span> <span id="s1033">We moved in human waste.</span> <span id="s1034">The stench is still up here, and it's, it's powerful.</span> <span id="s1035">There were three of us who planned, but two only escaped.</span> <span id="s1036">And some tried to talk us out of it.</span> <span id="s1037">"Look what can happen to us if they find you escaped.</span> <span id="s1038">They will kill us all!"</span> <span id="s1039">And our answer at this point was, "So what do you think awaits us, anyway?"</span> <span id="s1040">They were some in previous transports who tried to escape.</span> <span id="s1041">And one man was caught under the wheels and was then thrown back into the car with two legs amputated to bleed to his death.</span> <span id="s1042">And people died anyway.</span> <span id="s1043">Malnutrition.</span> <span id="s1044">Maybe some suicides.</span> <span id="s1045">There was this woman in crutches in that train, pointing her crutch at me in, in, in weapons style, like a weapon, like a dagger -- pointing it and telling me, "Que Dieu vous garde!"</span> <span id="s1046">-- "Let God keep you!</span> <span id="s1047">You must go.</span> <span id="s1048">You must do what you want to do.</span> <span id="s1049">Don't let anybody talk you out of it."</span> <span id="s1050">You be-- To her, we were a symbol.</span> <span id="s1051">We were a symbolism.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">Perhaps it will succeed, and then we can tell something about it.</span> <span id="s1053">A woman in crutches.</span> <span id="s1054">Every bit in her 70s, with streaky gray hair and deep, sad, dark, sad eyes, actually consoling a child that was there without a parent.</span> <span id="s1055">I don't know whether that father or mother was along.</span> <span id="s1056">The child was there crying, and she was in charge of that child.</span> <span id="s1057">And Tony was there -- a distant cousin of mine -- and her husband.</span> <span id="s1058">She was the one that had sewed on my star in the camp.</span> <span id="s1059">And under the star, I had a half a pound note of Irish pounds.</span> <span id="s1060">Under the star, under this star, there was a half a Irish pound note that I had salvaged over the last several years, sent to me by an aunt who had immigrated from Austria to Galway.</span> <span id="s1061">She had sent me that to Belgium, periodically, and I saved that one.</span> <span id="s1062">Didn't want to spend it or exchange it, just for an emergency.</span> <span id="s1063">Didn't even know what the value of it was.</span> <span id="s1064">But it was something to hold on to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">Tony sewed that onto me; said, "Why do you want that there?"</span> <span id="s1066">I said, "I want it under the star.</span> <span id="s1067">Sometime when I tear this star off, if I do run away, I would like to have that.</span> <span id="s1068">Maybe I can buy some bread or some -- buy a train ticket with it, or what have you."</span> <span id="s1069">But it was some, something.</span> <span id="s1070">And we planned on our getaway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">Q: What did you do?</span> <span id="s1072">03:03:24</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">A: I have repeated that so often, and I don't want to over-dramatize.</span> <span id="s1074">I don't want to be pleading any kind of heroship or anything like that.</span> <span id="s1075">But the kids, when I speak about it, to them this is like an adventure.</span> <span id="s1076">We are not heroes.</span> <span id="s1077">I don't even exult in the word "surviving" because it speaks of something so, so exclusive.</span> <span id="s1078">You survive.</span> <span id="s1079">How many did survive, really?</span> <span id="s1080">So, it's almost like you are putting down those who couldn't survive, and you exult in that.</span> <span id="s1081">It was fear, utter fear, that prevailed upon us to do that.</span> <span id="s1082">Two little words: fear and luck.</span> <span id="s1083">One has to motivate you, and the other one is there to hopefully let you succeed.</span> <span id="s1084">Luck, you have.</span> <span id="s1085">This is luck.</span> <span id="s1086">And it's only --</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">Q: What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">A: First, I would like for people to understand that if the hero that they, somebody whom they call hero -- whether they look at a person tells about it, or a monument that that, of some hero of years gone by --only that person knew really how scared he really was, you see.</span> <span id="s1089">You make a hero of somebody, but that person knew deep down that there was a lot of fear.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">Heroism isn't something that comes sort of at the spur of the moment.</span> <span id="s1091">How did we do it?</span> <span id="s1092">There was only one way of doing it.</span> <span id="s1093">Other than having tools to cut out the bottom of the train or cut out the ceiling, there was only one way -- the obvious way -- a window.</span> <span id="s1094">And these windows were squares.</span> <span id="s1095">Perhaps 24 by 18, something like that.</span> <span id="s1096">But you see, in cattle cars they are normally called "huit, quarante”-- eight horses, or 40 men, in military terms.</span> <span id="s1097">Both windows had bars, straight bars.</span> <span id="s1098">Two bars: the one on the one side facing the other track that runs parallel had barbed wire.</span> <span id="s1099">That would not have prevented us from using that window, because a barbed wire that's rusty can easily be bent back and forth and can be eliminated.</span> <span id="s1100">A barbed wire can be cut by bending back and forth a few times, and then you have just the bars to contend with.</span> <span id="s1101">But that window was not in our plan, because that was the window that was next to the other track and you don't want to jump when you jump onto a track.</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">Especially from a moving train, because you can't really take that big chance.</span> <span id="s1103">I mean, you want to succeed.</span> <span id="s1104">The left side -- the north side, as it were, because we were traveling east -- was the one that faced the ravine, the bushes that are alongside and the telephone post, and so on.</span> <span id="s1105">That's the window we chose through which we will make our getaway, we hoped to make our getaway.</span> <span id="s1106">And as soon as the train, we had all night to think about that.</span> <span id="s1107">We were walking in, in, around in miserable conditions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">03:06:57 I mean, we were sliding back and forth.</span> <span id="s1109">So the only way we tried in the morning to move these bars, but it wasn't possible.</span> <span id="s1110">We decided the only way that we could possibly do that is by trying to twist them or to bend them forcefully or forcibly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">03:07:20 And we dunked, we took our sweaters and we dunked them in human wastes, made them wet, to create a tensile cloth.</span> <span id="s1112">Dry cloth you cannot wring too well.</span> <span id="s1113">A towel, for instance.</span> <span id="s1114">But a wet cloth can be wrung and wrung and wrung, and it twists and twists until the moisture has dripped out entirely until it's dry.</span> <span id="s1115">That sort of principle is applied in a tourniquet style when you use it on an arm.</span> <span id="s1116">We used that as a tourniquet.</span> <span id="s1117">So if you figure that two bars, you twist that sweater around the bars and then you go twisting, twisting, twisting until you can, We helped each other.</span> <span id="s1118">We tried that several times.</span> <span id="s1119">It was no give yet.</span> <span id="s1120">There was no give yet.</span> <span id="s1121">But we hoped that something will happen.</span> <span id="s1122">And then we moved in the side and see maybe it gets loose a little bit.</span> <span id="s1123">But after a while, when we twisted again, again, we gave up for five minutes to catch our breath and we were perspiring.</span> <span id="s1124">We were working under pressure.</span> <span id="s1125">This was our getaway.</span> <span id="s1126">This was life.</span> <span id="s1127">There the countryside flew by us, that bucolic countryside -- France, the fields.</span> <span id="s1128">And this was -- we were approaching champagne country, you know.</span> <span id="s1129">The area of lusciousness.</span> <span id="s1130">But here we were going to certain death, which now we know.</span> <span id="s1131">At that 25 Eight, forty (French).</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">time, we only speculated.</span> <span id="s1133">But I am glad we did speculate.</span> <span id="s1134">It didn't let us fall into some sort of lethargy, like a lot of people were.</span> <span id="s1135">And we twisted and twisted, and then finally we saw that glimmer of hope where the bars in the frame started to move ever so slightly, ever so slightly.</span> <span id="s1136">And rust came out falling from that fitting that it was in, the hole that it is set in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">Rust came out.</span> <span id="s1138">Now, we never hoped to get the bar out of there; because they are set in like an inch or so, half an inch.</span> <span id="s1139">But we hoped to, them to be bending.</span> <span id="s1140">We worked for a while, and we saw them ever so slightly bend inward.</span> <span id="s1141">Then we used our hands to move them apart again, so that they should start loosening.</span> <span id="s1142">And it did that!</span> <span id="s1143">We moved them back into the proper position.</span> <span id="s1144">We went back and twisted again and this time, the bending inward was ever so slightly more of a bend.</span> <span id="s1145">And we put that again, did that.</span> <span id="s1146">We worked all day, being mindful of the fact that if the train would have to come to a stop, these things would have to be put into proper position.</span> <span id="s1147">Because then the guards would walk out of the first and the last car.</span> <span id="s1148">They were in the first car--that was a passenger car--and the last.</span> <span id="s1149">These were Gestapo, and these were the German guards.</span> <span id="s1150">And, of course, French police.</span> <span id="s1151">The French police, French collaborators.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">03:10:38 That's a chapter by itself.</span> <span id="s1153">Towards the late afternoon, those bars had moved apart, through our efforts, enough where we could see our way squeezing through it.</span> <span id="s1154">And we put them back into the original position, just again in case the train would come to a stop and the guards would come up and inspect.</span> <span id="s1155">One time the train stopped at a station, and the people there seeing it wanted to reach me.</span> <span id="s1156">We shouted "Water!"</span> <span id="s1157">The -- they didn't let them get close because these people were aware of three transports going by there every week.</span> <span id="s1158">Some of the people were aware of that, and sometimes that awareness helped communicate simply because some of us.</span> <span id="s1159">And I didn't do it, because I didn't leave family and friends.</span> <span id="s1160">But some of them, husbands or wives or children, whoever had left families behind in Drancy or hiding out somewhere, they would drop envelopes, and the people would pick them up and would put stamps on them and mail them.</span> <span id="s1161">Or just notes: "We are going away.</span> <span id="s1162">We are going away.</span> <span id="s1163">Don't forget us."</span> <span id="s1164">Cryptic notes like this, you see.</span> <span id="s1165">But they didn't let them approach.</span> <span id="s1166">We only made one stop.</span> <span id="s1167">In hindsight, I see exactly the time when the train -- because it's in the book - - when the train would arrive at the German border, and the German guards would take over everything by schedule.</span> <span id="s1168">But we did, Finally, under the cover of the darkness -- it could have been begin around seven o'clock, and it was dark at that time already.</span> <span id="s1169">We did climb out of that cattle car.</span> <span id="s1170">My cousin Tony, distant cousin Tony Gutefreund handed me my rucksack through.</span> <span id="s1171">I was the first one to step out.</span> <span id="s1172">I dropped down, held onto that bar, and then reached my way to the back of that cattle car to the coupling.</span> <span id="s1173">Reaching for the coupling with my foot, and standing and holding on to this, and then holding to that metal iron -- wrought iron -- stepladder that leads up to the roof, holding on to this, and stepping on those.</span> <span id="s1174">I was already half free.</span> <span id="s1175">I was standing there reaching my rucksack around, putting it only with one strap on my shoulder, and my friend came next.</span> <span id="s1176">He did the same procedure.</span> <span id="s1177">In fact, I told him already, "Now reach for the coupling -- la coupler.”</span> <span id="s1178">I stepped over to the next one, and he</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">26 Coupling (French).</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">used this one.</span> <span id="s1181">Our third friend that was going to go with us either never had the, the, got up the nerve to do it, or perhaps he was noticed by someone that he was reaching out, because at that very moment or just seconds later, the car, the train went into a slight curve on the north side.</span> <span id="s1182">That's the side we intended to jump.</span> <span id="s1183">And the curve is like a concave curve, which serves the guards as a means to inspect the whole length of the car, the train.</span> <span id="s1184">They are shining their flashlights up and down from the back and the front, and they cross somewhere in the middle, sort of a floodlight effect, to see that everything on the outside of that car is -- or those cattle trains, cattle cars, is still under control.</span> <span id="s1185">It is possible that they noticed that, because at that moment when the car, the train had come into that curve and somewhat slowed down--let's say, from 75 to 60 miles an hour or whatever, my friend standing on this coupling was the first to jump.</span> <span id="s1186">And I jumped right after him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">03:15:18 But at that very moment, we heard whistles and shots fired.</span> <span id="s1188">Up to this day, I think that one or two things happened to our friend.</span> <span id="s1189">He was caught in the crossfire of these beams and just didn't get out of the window.</span> <span id="s1190">He was attempting to, maybe he was a little heavier than us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">Whatever the case.</span> <span id="s1192">Or they may have caught him.</span> <span id="s1193">Those shots, however, were fired before the train came to a halt, because a few seconds later, the train came to a screeching halt and we heard more shots fired -- probably in the air.</span> <span id="s1194">Warning shots.</span> <span id="s1195">I don't think it was at our friend because I don't think he really ever made it out of the window.</span> <span id="s1196">But that's conjecture.</span> <span id="s1197">And voices: "Let's look for…Let's search…Run up and down.”</span> <span id="s1198">We were lying there in that ravine and that wet, tall grass, holding our breath together in a moment that seemed like hours.</span> <span id="s1199">But it was just a few minutes.</span> <span id="s1200">And it wasn't until we heard no longer any voices and we heard the train being set into motion again that we let our breath out.</span> <span id="s1201">For the first time in so many weeks, we were what you might call "free;" but at least -- if not entirely free, at least away from the train that was taking us to certain death.</span> <span id="s1202">Because only 72 hours earlier, 48 hours earlier, we were there in utter despair, put into a train.</span> <span id="s1203">This was a total metamorphosis in a few minutes.</span> <span id="s1204">We tried to make our way, and did make our way, into a village nearby.</span> <span id="s1205">By that time, everything was closed.</span> <span id="s1206">And because of blackout -- war time -- the windows were blue and blackened out.</span> <span id="s1207">And we went to this big shop, rapped on the door, and an apprentice, a young man, came to the door and told us that there was no bread, they are closed.</span> <span id="s1208">And we said, "Yes, we do not want bread at this moment.</span> <span id="s1209">But we would like for you to tell us where does the priest of the village live."</span> <span id="s1210">And he said, "Wait a minute."</span> <span id="s1211">-- "Un moment."</span> <span id="s1212">"Just a minute."</span> <span id="s1213">And he went in and got his jacket, came out with us and took us to the priest of the village, to his residence -- like a little house sacristy.</span> <span id="s1214">We rapped, rapped on the door.</span> <span id="s1215">We walked in, and the priest wanted to know, "What brings you here?"</span> <span id="s1216">The baker said, "These young men asked for your house."</span> <span id="s1217">Then he walked off.</span> <span id="s1218">"Qu'est qu'il se passe?"</span> <span id="s1219">-- "What's going on?"</span> <span id="s1220">At that time, we had torn off our star.</span> <span id="s1221">We didn't want to walk there with that.</span> <span id="s1222">And we felt later that this priest, that as good as he was and the shelter that he did give us, would have probably be a little more reassured if we had the star.</span> <span id="s1223">He would know we were escapees rather than maybe agents sent there to find out if he is really into helping people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">We told him we escaped from the train.</span> <span id="s1225">He said, "Ah, oui.</span> <span id="s1226">Trois fois par semaine."</span> <span id="s1227">--"Three times a week," he said.</span> <span id="s1228">Unfortunately, we never knew his name.</span> <span id="s1229">But names didn't matter at that particular time.</span> <span id="s1230">He didn't know ours either.</span> <span id="s1231">So, he said, "Oh, yeah, three times per week.</span> <span id="s1232">And you did escape from that."</span> <span id="s1233">"What we want is, can we stay for the night?"</span> <span id="s1234">He said, "What you first want is, is make yourself clean a little bit."</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">03:19:18 We came in.</span> <span id="s1236">We were -- smelled to high heaven.</span> <span id="s1237">We were infested.</span> <span id="s1238">"You may also be hungry," he said.</span> <span id="s1239">He put a pot up to warm some milk, give us bread and cheese.</span> <span id="s1240">And he says, "Une nuit seulement."</span> <span id="s1241">-- "Only one night."</span> <span id="s1242">"Parce que les patrols, le matin ils sont ici.</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">Toujours tous les matins a six heures."</span> <span id="s1244">-- "Towards six o'clock in the morning we have the patrols here.</span> <span id="s1245">I will let you stay for the night, but you have to be out of here before 6:00."</span> <span id="s1246">He gave us, let us wash up, gave us this warm milk and bread and cheese, and put us into a bed with white, crisp sheets, wishing us good night.</span> <span id="s1247">Where just hours before, we were thrown into a car at the end of rifle butts.</span> <span id="s1248">And in no time we fell asleep.</span> <span id="s1249">Exhaustion!</span> <span id="s1250">We let ourselves just fade away into a dreamland.</span> <span id="s1251">Next morning -- and that night went so fast -- a tender tap on the shoulder.</span> <span id="s1252">He says, "Les gars,”-- "Hey, guys!</span> <span id="s1253">Hey, guys!</span> <span id="s1254">Hey, guys, it's time to get up."</span> <span id="s1255">Can you imagine a voice speaking in nice terms, like it was just like somebody, an angel, had just come down?</span> <span id="s1256">We hated to leave that bed.</span> <span id="s1257">But he had breakfast prepared.</span> <span id="s1258">He gave us a note to a colleague of his, a priest in another village.</span> <span id="s1259">He gave us some francs and food for the road.</span> <span id="s1260">And we were walking, walking, as we bid him goodbye and thanked him.</span> <span id="s1261">As I said, unfortunately, we never knew his name and he didn't know ours.</span> <span id="s1262">But again, this was not a moment to dwell on that.</span> <span id="s1263">And on the road we, we took advantage of one of those farm trucks that went back, a horse-pulled truck, a farm wagon, hay wagon.</span> <span id="s1264">And he took us into a next village, where he was then.</span> <span id="s1265">We walked again; we wound up into that village where that other priest lived that he gave us the address to.</span> <span id="s1266">And, you know, the priest wasn't home.</span> <span id="s1267">This was Saturday morning.</span> <span id="s1268">He was out at Mass somewhere.</span> <span id="s1269">And we asked the maid that was there, "When will he be back?"</span> <span id="s1270">She said, "Shortly."</span> <span id="s1271">So we walked into the cemetery to just visit graves, so we shouldn't be noticed by anybody in the streets.</span> <span id="s1272">The cemetery is a safe place.</span> <span id="s1273">The police doesn't go there to search for people walking around.</span> <span id="s1274">We had our berets on, because we had our heads shaven.</span> <span id="s1275">Then we got back to the priest.</span> <span id="s1276">And it was about lunch time, and he gave us lunch because he had the recommen-- he had a note from that other Reverend Father.</span> <span id="s1277">He gave us lunch, and when he, when he stood there, saying his prayer, his blessing over the meal, we being Jewish had no ideas as to what, we just bent down and moved our lips.</span> <span id="s1278">That night, he let us spend the night in his stable of cows.</span> <span id="s1279">We slept between cows on straw, fresh straw he prepared.</span> <span id="s1280">But that odor of the cow and that odor of the stable was perfume.</span> <span id="s1281">And the coziness, the warmth of the cows, the animals chewing the cud, was almost as if you hear rain drop dropping on your windowpane when you try to fall asleep.</span> <span id="s1282">It was a cozy sound and a good, good odor.</span> <span id="s1283">Again, I am coming back to that odor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">03:23:44 27 Young men (French).</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">When I -- today when I go through a farming country and I smell the odor of cows and stable and dung, it's, it's a perfume -- it's Chanel No. 60, or whatever.</span> <span id="s1286">But it is a perfume.</span> <span id="s1287">And next morning, he again urged us to leave, gave us an address of a farmer with whom we spent the next night.</span> <span id="s1288">And that farmer, in some way -- he put us up in a barn - -had to be connected with some underground because next morning he came to us, took us to the railroad station and gave us two tickets to Paris.</span> <span id="s1289">And Sunday, the eight, two days after our escape, we landed in the Gare de L'estin Paris, got off the train in Paris.</span> <span id="s1290">Again, carrying our star in our pockets, not on the lapel.</span> <span id="s1291">Hair shaven.</span> <span id="s1292">And when we were in that train, or was it on the road that I mentioned to Fred?</span> <span id="s1293">By the way, it was Sunday.</span> <span id="s1294">He would not have let us go on that train if it was Monday because during the week there are patrols.</span> <span id="s1295">"On Sunday, there are, there are, it's a day off, even for the inspectors for the soldiers for the Germans.</span> <span id="s1296">It's easier to travel on Sunday.</span> <span id="s1297">You should be all right 'til Paris."</span> <span id="s1298">And he said, "If something happens want you to escape from a train there, you will be able to do something in this case."</span> <span id="s1299">But I mentioned to Fred, "Fred, 30 years from now when we will think about this, we will think back of it as a dream.</span> <span id="s1300">We wouldn't even believe it happened."</span> <span id="s1301">So he said, "Are you crazy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">You are a fool!"</span> <span id="s1303">I said, "Why do you say that?"</span> <span id="s1304">"How can you think of 30 years from now when we don't even know what tomorrow will be?"</span> <span id="s1305">I said, "You know, now that we are out of that train, nothing will -- nothing is impossible any longer.</span> <span id="s1306">I look forward now to, to surviving and telling about it."</span> <span id="s1307">That was my spirit.</span> <span id="s1308">And a lot of them later, again, didn't make it, and it could have happened to me, too, because I had so many instances and so many situations that I got out of that were only too, too close to call.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">03:25:44 But at that moment, I saw the future.</span> <span id="s1310">And he berated me for it.</span> <span id="s1311">He said, "I know what you mean.</span> <span id="s1312">But we don't even have papers.</span> <span id="s1313">We don't know where to go from here."</span> <span id="s1314">"We go to Paris.</span> <span id="s1315">We going to seek my Aunt out who lives in Paris."</span> <span id="s1316">Her son at that time was hiding in the mountains somewhere.</span> <span id="s1317">She was hiding also with a priest in Paris that was recommended to her by a police captain who liked the family.</span> <span id="s1318">And he has known her from before, before she was a widow yet.</span> <span id="s1319">And he prevailed that this priest take her in.</span> <span id="s1320">The concierge that I went to on Rue St. Mort (ph) to look for my aunt wanted to know who I am.</span> <span id="s1321">"I am her nephew."</span> <span id="s1322">"What is your name?"</span> <span id="s1323">I said, "Leo."</span> <span id="s1324">She said, "I can't tell you where she is, but I can go and see her."</span> <span id="s1325">She realized that I was a nephew.</span> <span id="s1326">I look a little bit like my aunt, too.</span> <span id="s1327">We have the same coloration.</span> <span id="s1328">She's my mother's sister.</span> <span id="s1329">And she brought her back a half an hour later.</span> <span id="s1330">And there, of course, she held us for several days in her place, and went to a Jewish committee that was engaged in producing false ID cards.</span> <span id="s1331">And she made some of those, two cards for us, and with that card we crossed into the unoccupied zone of France near Tours across the Loire River.</span> <span id="s1332">But once across the Loire River, we were arrested.</span> <span id="s1333">We were arrested trying to get a bus.</span> <span id="s1334">At the bus stop the police examined our papers, took them away from us, took us into the police station.</span> <span id="s1335">Did not make much of a fuss.</span> <span id="s1336">We told them that we escaped from the train.</span> <span id="s1337">"Yeah, but you are now in free France."</span> <span id="s1338">You know, another ploy.</span> <span id="s1339">But we did not want to tell them, "Yes, we came from here."</span> <span id="s1340">28 Railway East (French).</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">03:28:06 We didn’t want to let on that we may have some footholds or people that we know.</span> <span id="s1342">“Well, here’s some ration cards.”</span> <span id="s1343">They gave us ration cards.</span> <span id="s1344">Within 24 hours, with this ration card, they gave us a Laisser-passer -- safe conduct.</span> <span id="s1345">"You have to register.</span> <span id="s1346">You have to appear and register at Centre d'Acceuil," --whatever the camp was called -- "Centre d'Acceuil."</span> <span id="s1347">Again, Center of -- Reception Center.</span> <span id="s1348">"And present yourself there with these papers."</span> <span id="s1349">Now why did they not take us there, but let us do it by ourselves?</span> <span id="s1350">Because their administration was so geared on collaborating with the Germans and inspecting everything that they thought that for us to think to not do this would be ludicrous.</span> <span id="s1351">Also, by them telling us, "Oh, you escape from a train from, " We told them outright, "We escaped from a train, then we went to Paris, we got these papers."</span> <span id="s1352">"Who made these papers for you?"</span> <span id="s1353">I said, "I don't know.</span> <span id="s1354">I don't know.</span> <span id="s1355">We just had a friend up there who knew about somebody gave us paper."</span> <span id="s1356">And he doesn't worry about that, simply because that is in the other zone with the Germans.</span> <span id="s1357">He is only concerned with his aspect of law enforcement.</span> <span id="s1358">And by telling us, "You are now in the Free Zone of France" -- not knowing that we were in that so-called "Free Zone" before but we're coming from the north -- that he will give us that confidence, inspire confidence or in any way con us into thinking that everything is fine.</span> <span id="s1359">"And you are going to a Centre d'Acceuil."</span> <span id="s1360">You see, that euphemism again.</span> <span id="s1361">But we knew better.</span> <span id="s1362">And instead for the Centre d'Acceuil, my friend and I went to the town where he last lived in the south of France and saw that everything was all right with him.</span> <span id="s1363">We exchanged addresses, because I told him, "I will go somewhere where you can get in touch with me."</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">Q: What town is this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">A: Bagnères-de-Bigorre.</span> <span id="s1366">I left him there to his devices.</span> <span id="s1367">That was the last time -- no, I saw him one more time, and I will tell you that later.</span> <span id="s1368">I left him to his devices, he left me to mine, and I went to Bagnères-de-Bigorre.</span> <span id="s1369">I arrived in Bagnères-de-Bigorre at night, after eight o'clock.</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">And, and coming out of the train station, there is a gendarme inspecting everybody who comes out of there.</span> <span id="s1371">And I have no papers!</span> <span id="s1372">They were inspecting people, not to catch them in any way, in some, in some situation of having run away or escaped.</span> <span id="s1373">I looked French pretty much at that time, spoke French very well.</span> <span id="s1374">I am dark.</span> <span id="s1375">In the southern France part, people look a little bit like this.</span> <span id="s1376">With my beret, I could strike the pose of a Frenchman very easily.</span> <span id="s1377">But what he was interested in, to look into my rucksack.</span> <span id="s1378">If I am not carrying anything contraband.</span> <span id="s1379">Eggs were rationed, and wine was rationed, and bread was rationed, and butter was rationed, and meat was rationed.</span> <span id="s1380">I could have easily come from the country bringing all that into the town to do some black market.</span> <span id="s1381">So he -- here's the comical part: I told you there's some comical parts to my escapes or escapades.</span> <span id="s1382">Isn't that interesting, that the word "escape" is really contained in the word "escapade?"</span> <span id="s1383">"Une minute," he says to me.</span> <span id="s1384">"One moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">Wait a minute."</span> <span id="s1386">There was another gendarme a few steps away, like near the other exit.</span> <span id="s1387">Two exits are the, the train station.</span> <span id="s1388">Who was inspecting a lady with a rucksack with some baggage.</span> <span id="s1389">This gendarme wanted to inspect my rucksack, but didn't have a flashlight on him.</span> <span id="s1390">He says, "Une minute."</span> <span id="s1391">He trusts me, right?</span> <span id="s1392">Had he known me, he wouldn't have, you see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">“Un minute.”</span> <span id="s1394">02:32:18 He goes over there.</span> <span id="s1395">In a minute goes over there, and wants that flashlight.</span> <span id="s1396">By the time he came back with the flashlight, I was gone, got to the Spira's house that they rented.</span> <span id="s1397">A big, like a villa-type thing, and the gate, lo and behold, an iron gate with stakes is closed and locked.</span> <span id="s1398">I am not about to ring the bell, because they might come out so quickly, the owner of the house who lives in the same building.</span> <span id="s1399">By that time, nobody knew that I had escaped from Drancy.</span> <span id="s1400">All they knew, by me having written from them from Rivesaltes that I was going to Drancy to be deported.</span> <span id="s1401">What did I do?</span> <span id="s1402">I climbed up that fence, and there are these concrete posts at the side of the fence -- you know, some of them have vases or figurines up there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">These had two lions, two smiling lions, one on each side, sitting there, looking at me.</span> <span id="s1404">And I climbed up that fence, reached over to that circle to that pillar on which the lions were sitting, climbed up to the lions and let myself down, jumping down.</span> <span id="s1405">In the process, moving that lion close to the edge of that pillar so that the bottom, the base of that lion was slightly overlapping the bar, the, the pillar.</span> <span id="s1406">Had I held on to it maybe a little more and dragged it with me, this thing could have fallen down and made a lot of noise and really given me away.</span> <span id="s1407">But it just stood there this way.</span> <span id="s1408">The next morning, when Spira went out and looked at it, he said, "You were lucky.</span> <span id="s1409">This lion could have fallen on you."</span> <span id="s1410">I proceeded in that -- there was a garden in front and a pathway, a paved pathway, to the house -- proceeded to walk up there, to their door entrance, rang the bell.</span> <span id="s1411">And they opened the door, and they almost fainted.</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">Agape: "How, how, how?</span> <span id="s1413">Where, where were you?"</span> <span id="s1414">Well, I started telling my story.</span> <span id="s1415">"Well, Leo, you are going to stay here until we decide on something.</span> <span id="s1416">You will not leave this place.</span> <span id="s1417">That was close to the eighth of November, eighth of November.</span> <span id="s1418">This was close to the beginning of December, already, of '42.</span> <span id="s1419">I stayed in this place for about a week or 10 days.</span> <span id="s1420">And I got, in Yiddish, you say you have shpilkas.On pins and needles!</span> <span id="s1421">I had to move.</span> <span id="s1422">And against the advice of my friends, the Spiras, I went to go out and get bread.</span> <span id="s1423">I had lived in Bagnères-de-Bigorre many, many months, you see.</span> <span id="s1424">And I knew this baker, Mr. Broca -- B- R-O-C-A -- very well, who always treated me good.</span> <span id="s1425">When I came with a coupon for a half loaf, he gave me a little more than a half a loaf.</span> <span id="s1426">I became very friendly with him.</span> <span id="s1427">He always gave me a little more.</span> <span id="s1428">He, young kid and so on, I went to get bread, against the advice of Spira.</span> <span id="s1429">On the way back from Broca, walking back to the Spiras, two gendarmes on bicycles recognized me and shouted and pointed at me.</span> <span id="s1430">And I started running.</span> <span id="s1431">But against the bicycle, I wasn't fast enough.</span> <span id="s1432">And they arrested me.</span> <span id="s1433">That was on the sixth of December, 1942.</span> <span id="s1434">I spent one night in the gendarmerie.</span> <span id="s1435">They wanted to know where I spent the night since then, that they sensed that when I ran away at the train at the station.</span> <span id="s1436">And I didn't tell them.</span> <span id="s1437">I said, "I was here in the woods.</span> <span id="s1438">I was walking around.</span> <span id="s1439">I was out of town, and I came back."</span> <span id="s1440">"But you have friends here.</span> <span id="s1441">We know who they are."</span> <span id="s1442">"Oh, yeah, I knew a lot of people here," I said.</span> <span id="s1443">"But they are already gone by now, like I was."</span> <span id="s1444">“Abandoné de residence,”that was the, that was the, that was my indictment.</span> <span id="s1445">The Southern French Vichy Government were the, the</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">29 Worries (Yiddish).</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">30 Abandonment of residence (French).</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">police and the authorities were, again, not concerned with my escape from the train in the north.</span> <span id="s1449">Only that I escaped, that I left originally my assigned residence in Cauterets.</span> <span id="s1450">That was what they, that was against the law.</span> <span id="s1451">So when they arrested me, put me in that cell, the next day on the seventh of December I was taken to jail in Tarbes.</span> <span id="s1452">Tarbes is the seat -- Prefecture, to you.</span> <span id="s1453">That's the seat of the, of the Department.</span> <span id="s1454">And I waited.</span> <span id="s1455">They assigned a lawyer to me from the Vichy Government, Maître Laouie (ph), and on the eighth of May, 19 -- I am sorry.</span> <span id="s1456">Eighth of January, 1943, I was taken back to Bagnères by jail authorities to face trial.</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">03:38:15 On the eighth of January I was tried and sentenced to one year in jail.</span> <span id="s1458">On the behest of the lawyer, he said, "If you are in jail, you will be in jail.</span> <span id="s1459">They cannot deport you while you are in jail, except if there is an attack on a German position in the town or something.</span> <span id="s1460">If there is a -- some underground or resistance action that they want to retaliate against, they can take hostages then.</span> <span id="s1461">In jail you are not in the safest place, but it's safer than being on the streets, on the roads, and being arrested, taken to Drancy."</span> <span id="s1462">Because they would take the political and the Jews out of jail as hostages.</span> <span id="s1463">That has happened quite frequently.</span> <span id="s1464">Sentenced to one year in jail--which means, if you get one year and one day, that means you serve the full year and one day.</span> <span id="s1465">But if you are sentenced to one year, that means you are entitled to quarter off for good behavior.</span> <span id="s1466">So you serve actually nine months.</span> <span id="s1467">Lo and behold, after my sentencing on eighth of January 1943, I escaped from the gendarmes.</span> <span id="s1468">They went into a bar, a bistro, and I conned them into taking off the handcuffs, off their hand, because I have to go to the bathroom.</span> <span id="s1469">You see, they were cuffed to theirs and mine.</span> <span id="s1470">And they figured they can do that, because, after all, I have my handcuffs on.</span> <span id="s1471">Where can I do?</span> <span id="s1472">"Can you let me go to the bathroom?"</span> <span id="s1473">But instead of going to the bathroom, I ran away.</span> <span id="s1474">I had seen Drancy, and I didn't want to ever have to go back to Drancy again.</span> <span id="s1475">I had seen it.</span> <span id="s1476">I ran away from the gendarmes.</span> <span id="s1477">It was a very emotional thing, at the time.</span> <span id="s1478">I went to a grocery store and asked them to get in touch with the Spiras.</span> <span id="s1479">Didn't want to go back to the Spiras.</span> <span id="s1480">I wasn't going to jeopardize them.</span> <span id="s1481">Because the Spiras had come to the trial, and sit there and watch my trial.</span> <span id="s1482">And other people that I still had known there went to that trial and watched.</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">03:41:14 And they went to the Spiras and told them about me.</span> <span id="s1484">And the girls came to the grocery store, the daughters, to see me and to tell me that the gendarmes had been there already to want to find out where I am.</span> <span id="s1485">"Because he is probably your boyfriend," they said to Suzy.</span> <span id="s1486">Because Suzy, when I was incarcerated in Bagnères, after they had called me, after that incident that I had went for bread, they had put me for one night into the gendarmerie before the took me to jail.</span> <span id="s1487">Suzy and her sister came to visit me there.</span> <span id="s1488">But they could do that, because they knew that the Jews knew each other.</span> <span id="s1489">But in this case: "Where is he?"</span> <span id="s1490">And they went to their house and they said they don't not know.</span> <span id="s1491">All they know is that they saw me last time at -- in the courthouse.</span> <span id="s1492">And in no uncertain terms, they told them that "If he will come here, we will not let him stay.</span> <span id="s1493">In fact, if he will come here, we will have to let you know, because we don't want him to be running around and be caught again.</span> <span id="s1494">He's probably safer in jail."</span> <span id="s1495">They played it that way.</span> <span id="s1496">I ran away.</span> <span id="s1497">And they told me right there at that grocery store, "Do not come to us.</span> <span id="s1498">It doesn't pay."</span> <span id="s1499">With a hacksaw, they cut my cuffs off and left them there.</span> <span id="s1500">And I meandered for 48 hours in the -- at night.</span> <span id="s1501">It became night by that time.</span> <span id="s1502">On a rainy night, into the direction of Toulouse.</span> <span id="s1503">I wanted to get somewhere to get -- I had hidden some money away that they were not able to take from me in jail.</span> <span id="s1504">I had hidden it in my anus.</span> <span id="s1505">And when I left that grocery store, my first stop was again to the baker, Mr. Broca.</span> <span id="s1506">He gave me some bread.</span> <span id="s1507">He told me that already the radio had said that the fellow who lived here before in the -- in Bagnères-de-Bigorre had escaped, to be on the look out, and your name was mentioned.</span> <span id="s1508">So he said, "You know, you cannot stay in Bagnères."</span> <span id="s1509">I said, "I know.</span> <span id="s1510">Can I have some bread, please -- to, for the road?"</span> <span id="s1511">He gave me that, he gave me 20 francs.</span> <span id="s1512">And also, in the courthouse, one of the friends that I had, when I went to the bathroom -- my ploy was always to go to the bathroom--had stood next to me in the bathroom and also had handed me 10 francs.</span> <span id="s1513">So I was pretty much equipped, as far as money goes, for a little food and that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s1514">Couldn't make many, couldn't buy a train ticket or something like that, but I figured maybe a freight train, or pick up a, hitch a ride or something.</span> <span id="s1515">I wandered all night in the rain and again slept under a tree in the forest, leaning against the tree.</span> <span id="s1516">And the next morning, I arrived in a little village.</span> <span id="s1517">I forgot the name of that village.</span> <span id="s1518">In the same area.</span> <span id="s1519">But I must have gone in circles at night, because I had not been that far away from Bagnères-de-Bigorre.</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">Went into the restaurant and ordered a platter of beans, and sit down to eat it.</span> <span id="s1521">And my collar had, the coat collar from, of the rain coat, a gabardine rain coat in blue, had this collar upon my neck.</span> <span id="s1522">I had a blue line around here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">03:45:14 And I was sitting there, ragged as I must have looked --because I had shaved hair from jail-- and the owner of that restaurant went to the telephone.</span> <span id="s1524">I saw him go to the telephone and whisper something into the telephone.</span> <span id="s1525">And at that point, I was resigned not to run because I was really tired.</span> <span id="s1526">I was really worn out from the night.</span> <span id="s1527">I was really exhausted, and emotionally, I was really down in the dumps because I hadn't wandered that far from Bagnères.</span> <span id="s1528">I thought I had made more headway.</span> <span id="s1529">And in a few minutes, two gendarmes walked in, come up to my table.</span> <span id="s1530">And they said, "Finish the beans."</span> <span id="s1531">And I said, "No, that's for the boss.</span> <span id="s1532">I leave that for him.</span> <span id="s1533">He probably needs that food much more than I." I made such a sarcastic remark.</span> <span id="s1534">And they found money on me.</span> <span id="s1535">I spend the night in the gendarmerie, and the next morning I was picked up by the gendarmes from Tarbes.</span> <span id="s1536">The same gendarmes that had accompanied me to the courthouse.</span> <span id="s1537">The same two men from whom, whose custody I had escaped.</span> <span id="s1538">Now, you can just imagine how they felt toward me.</span> <span id="s1539">They beat me real good, fists, key reinforced fists.</span> <span id="s1540">Then they took a stoking arm from a, from the chimney, and they had a little a little chimney -- what you call it?</span> <span id="s1541">A fireplace.</span> <span id="s1542">In the police station.</span> <span id="s1543">Had took that poker and beat me on my back and on my legs.</span> <span id="s1544">They wanted to know why I did that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">That's bad for them.</span> <span id="s1546">I put them into jeopardy.</span> <span id="s1547">They will be fired.</span> <span id="s1548">And I apologized.</span> <span id="s1549">You see, in France, you do not sentence a prisoner for more time because he escaped.</span> <span id="s1550">The prisoner gets the free time that he spent away from the jail just added to the sentence instead of nine months.</span> <span id="s1551">And still, given good behavior, I was going to serve nine months and two days.</span> <span id="s1552">It is -- the onus is on the guardians.</span> <span id="s1553">The onus is on the gendarmes to make sure that that prisoner does not escape.</span> <span id="s1554">That's their job.</span> <span id="s1555">In America, it's different.</span> <span id="s1556">When you escape, you get punished for that.</span> <span id="s1557">But in, in military training, the soldiers are trained to escape.</span> <span id="s1558">They are going through training.</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">03:47:56</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">Q: Let's bring -- we have 10 minutes.</span> <span id="s1561">I want to bring it up and I want to move to Toulouse.</span> <span id="s1562">How did you get, how long did you spend in jail?</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">A: I spent in jail nine months and two days.</span> <span id="s1564">I was taken on the ninth of September 1943 out of jail, and transported to a forced labor -- not forced labor camp.</span> <span id="s1565">A hard labor camp in Septfond, Department Tarn-et-Garonne.</span> <span id="s1566">I was one of hundreds of prisoners there.</span> <span id="s1567">In that camp, my friend with whom I had escaped had found out where I was taken.</span> <span id="s1568">He came to visit me, and he gave me an address that I can write to in case I manage to become free.</span> <span id="s1569">My correspondence to that camp, which I was entitled to receive for a month, I was sitting there banging stones, rocks, making it into small stones.</span> <span id="s1570">My correspondence that I got there, I found out later, was kept and censored and not given to me.</span> <span id="s1571">The correspondence that I sent out went out, but was also read and censored.</span> <span id="s1572">So my friend came and gave me an address, and I memorized it.</span> <span id="s1573">I didn't write it down.</span> <span id="s1574">On the 15th of October, 1943, was the Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s1575">And the Germans have a knack for doing that on a Jewish holiday.</span> <span id="s1576">The day before, on the 14th, we were informed that the next day we were going to be taken to Organization Todt.</span> <span id="s1577">That is the, the organization, German Organization Todt.</span> <span id="s1578">They were building fortifications named after Todt, who was the armament minister who was later replaced by Speer, and when Todt died Speer took over.</span> <span id="s1579">Organization Todt was supposed to take us to the Atlantic War building.</span> <span id="s1580">And there was 14 of us to be taken away for that.</span> <span id="s1581">And again, we discussed: "Will we really go there?</span> <span id="s1582">Is this just a ploy?</span> <span id="s1583">Will we wind up in Drancy again?"</span> <span id="s1584">And there was a guard by the name of Kaufmann.</span> <span id="s1585">He was an Alsace-Lorraine native -- spoke Germany fluently and French fluently.</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">03:50:01 To me he spoke German.</span> <span id="s1587">And sometimes also spoke French.</span> <span id="s1588">He said to me, "Bretholz, Morgen begleit Ich Si.”</span> <span id="s1589">-- "Tomorrow, I will be accompanying you,” and then there will be no more running away.</span> <span id="s1590">And you know what I said to him?</span> <span id="s1591">"Mr. Kaufmann, " Or, "Kaufmann, " Because prisoners and guards get sort of chummy there; they develop a relationship.</span> <span id="s1592">"Kaufmann, you want to know?</span> <span id="s1593">It is true you will accompany me tomorrow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">But whether I run away or not will not depend on you.</span> <span id="s1595">It will strictly depend on me."</span> <span id="s1596">That's what I told him.</span> <span id="s1597">The next day, we were taken to Toulouse.</span> <span id="s1598">A friend of mine in the camp befriended me in this month, you know.</span> <span id="s1599">His wife lived nearby.</span> <span id="s1600">She was going to come to the railroad station to bring him some food.</span> <span id="s1601">They allowed that to happen, bring him some food for the trip.</span> <span id="s1602">She brought the two kids along, too.</span> <span id="s1603">I said, "When you wife comes there, will you please ask her to buy me a ticket for Toulouse?"</span> <span id="s1604">He said, "What do you need a ticket 31 Bretholz, tomorrow I accompany you (German).</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">for?"</span> <span id="s1606">I said, "If I run away."</span> <span id="s1607">He said, "You are not going to run away."</span> <span id="s1608">"If I run away, I want to have a ticket."</span> <span id="s1609">Because on the stations, out of the railroad stations, in France, you have to present your travel ticket, to see that you haven't traveled for free.</span> <span id="s1610">He said, “What are you doing?”</span> <span id="s1611">I said, "Can she do it?"</span> <span id="s1612">He said, "Sure, I'll tell her."</span> <span id="s1613">She bought a ticket.</span> <span id="s1614">I gave them the little money that I had.</span> <span id="s1615">He gave it to her.</span> <span id="s1616">She bought me the ticket.</span> <span id="s1617">When we arrived in the railroad station of Toulouse, and the train was standing -- this was a passenger train with those individual doors leading to each compartment -- when we were lined up there to be, to be prepared, ready to get into that train, I asked Kaufmann if I may go to the bathroom.</span> <span id="s1618">He said, "Oh, come on.</span> <span id="s1619">You don't mean that."</span> <span id="s1620">He said, "You don't mean that.</span> <span id="s1621">What do you think, I am crazy?"</span> <span id="s1622">I said, "Well, I can't blame you.</span> <span id="s1623">Okay, fine.</span> <span id="s1624">I can't blame you.</span> <span id="s1625">I'll wait until I am in the train."</span> <span id="s1626">That was to placate him.</span> <span id="s1627">But when I saw, not a cattle train, but a train with doors and windows, I saw freedom.</span> <span id="s1628">But I placated him by saying, "Oh, I go in the train."</span> <span id="s1629">Now, these foolish guards, We have about eight guards for 14 people, seven guards.</span> <span id="s1630">Instead of going with us into the train, at least a couple of them, all seven were standing in front to see that we don't get out.</span> <span id="s1631">And nobody watching what was going on in the inside.</span> <span id="s1632">So I said to my friend -- the one whose wife had bought the ticket for me -- "I am ready to go.</span> <span id="s1633">Do you want to go with me?"</span> <span id="s1634">He said, "No, I can't.</span> <span id="s1635">My wife is there.</span> <span id="s1636">My children there.</span> <span id="s1637">I don't want to jeopardize my life.</span> <span id="s1638">This is -- okay."</span> <span id="s1639">I went to the back window, inched to the back window, and says, "You just stay there and see if Kaufmann and his cohorts are coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">You just stay there.</span> <span id="s1641">When you see them come, then tell me."</span> <span id="s1642">I went to the back window, lowered the back window, dropped myself, lost a shoe in the process, one of those loafer- type sandals, that I put it back on.</span> <span id="s1643">My beret fell off my head.</span> <span id="s1644">I picked that up.</span> <span id="s1645">My rucksack I still had, that steady companion.</span> <span id="s1646">On the next track, there was a freight car parked on the, on the track.</span> <span id="s1647">In standing position, I went under that freight car, went to the subterranean exit -- because I knew the train station of Toulouse -- walked up there.</span> <span id="s1648">I had a ticket, but I never needed it.</span> <span id="s1649">I showed that ticket into the luggage room.</span> <span id="s1650">I went to the luggage room, and I made out that I am looking for luggage.</span> <span id="s1651">"It just arrived."</span> <span id="s1652">I said, "Where?"</span> <span id="s1653">He said, "Well, you have to have a, a, coupon."</span> <span id="s1654">You have to have a ticket for your luggage."</span> <span id="s1655">I said, "Well, maybe my friend, my friend, maybe my friend has it, because we came together.</span> <span id="s1656">But here's my train ticket."</span> <span id="s1657">I showed him the train ticket.</span> <span id="s1658">He said, "That is okay."</span> <span id="s1659">I walked out from the luggage room right into the street.</span> <span id="s1660">There was no friend waiting for me.</span> <span id="s1661">But I said, "My friend has it."</span> <span id="s1662">I walked out there.</span> <span id="s1663">And I had friends in living in Blagnac near Toulouse, and I made my way to Blagnac and showed up at Jacques Estrajch’s place.</span> <span id="s1664">And guess what he told me?</span> <span id="s1665">"I got your card you are going to the Organization Todt.</span> <span id="s1666">Did you get mine?"</span> <span id="s1667">"No, I didn't get yours."</span> <span id="s1668">He said, "I wrote to you."</span> <span id="s1669">Then I knew that I didn't get the mail.</span> <span id="s1670">And I also knew that as soon as I escaped in Toulouse, the first place they will be looking at will be Blagnac, because that's the nearest place to my escape.</span> <span id="s1671">He said, "Go upstairs and take a rest and sleep.</span> <span id="s1672">If somebody comes, I'll tell him you are not here."</span> <span id="s1673">I slept two hours, I came down, and guess what he told me?</span> <span id="s1674">"The gendarmes were here to look for you, because they know that you had written to me.</span> <span id="s1675">And I told them yes, you wrote you are going to Organization Todt.</span> <span id="s1676">But otherwise, I don't know anything."</span> <span id="s1677">He said, "Leo, you have got to leave.</span> <span id="s1678">They told me that if they find you here, they have got to take me also."</span></p> <p><span id="s1679">Q: Where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1680">03:55:02</span></p> <p><span id="s1681">A: He took me to an elderly couple that was living there from, originally from Paris.</span> <span id="s1682">They were living there in the southern zone of France.</span> <span id="s1683">They kept me for a couple of weeks.</span> <span id="s1684">Kept me for couple of weeks.</span> <span id="s1685">I wrote to my friend whose address I had memorized.</span> <span id="s1686">He sent me my false birth certificate, with an address where to go to and on the first of November, I joined an address in Saint-Vallier on the Rhône River south of Lyon with the French underground, presenting myself with my birth certificate.</span> <span id="s1687">And from that moment on, I was Max Henri Lefévre.</span> <span id="s1688">I was four years younger.</span> <span id="s1689">I was born on the 25th of October in Saint Jouin-sur-Mer.</span> <span id="s1690">I knew the name of my father and mother, and legalized, regularized my situation with French ID papers under the name of Max Henri Lefévre.</span></p> <p><span id="s1691">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s1692">Leo, thank you very much.</span> <span id="s1693">A: You are out of breath, and so am I.</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">Q: Yes, that is quite a story.</span> <span id="s1695">And we are done.</span> <span id="s1696">And it's only half of it.</span> <span id="s1697">Now I want the whole other half in the underground.</span> <span id="s1698">What we are going to have to do is to do that.</span> <span id="s1699">If you did not have the appointment now, I would go for another hour.</span></p> <p><span id="s1700">A: That is all I do in the underground.</span></p> <p><span id="s1701">Q: Yes, and I want to do that.</span> <span id="s1702">Let us talk.</span> <span id="s1703">Would you mind coming back?</span> <span id="s1704">A: I can do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">Q: Because all that in the underground is important.</span> <span id="s1706">03:56:08 Conclusion of July 31, 1989 interview</span></p> <p><span id="s1707">September 27, 1989</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION</span></p> <p><span id="s1709">Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s1710">01:00:43</span></p> <p><span id="s1711">Q: Let's take it back.</span> <span id="s1712">You had arrived and you were being placed with an elderly couple.</span> <span id="s1713">Tell us where you are, and tell me something about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1714">A: This is a village called Blagnac -- B-L-A-G-N-A-C -- in the area of Toulouse, one of the major cities in the south of France.</span> <span id="s1715">That's the town I had reached in that convoy that I escaped from on that afternoon.</span> <span id="s1716">It was from a standing train in the train station of Toulouse, as I explained previously.</span> <span id="s1717">So I am in Blagnac; my friend, Jacques Estrajch, takes me to this elderly couple, just con-- suggesting, or hoping that they would keep me just for a week or two until I can make arrangements for the future where to go.</span> <span id="s1718">And they were very amenable, friendly.</span> <span id="s1719">I spent two weeks with them.</span> <span id="s1720">The evening hours filled with -- the time of the evening hours was filled with listening to Radio London, was broadcasting the news from the front, war fronts, and all other news that pertained to the French Resistance and the war going on.</span> <span id="s1721">And I contacted the friend with whom I had escaped in November of 1942.</span> <span id="s1722">I had memorized his address and sent him the information where I was now located.</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">Q: How did you do that?</span> <span id="s1724">A: Meaning what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">Q: Meaning, can one simply post a letter and expect it to get to its destination?</span></p> <p><span id="s1726">A: In France, you could just post a letter.</span> <span id="s1727">In Southern France, that was in the, what you call Vichy Zone.</span> <span id="s1728">If we're writing to the northern zone, past the demarcation line, there were special post cards that were printed in the post office, preprinted with, "I am well.</span> <span id="s1729">Please do this."</span> <span id="s1730">This was almost like a form letter.</span> <span id="s1731">Between the occupied and the Vichy Zone, there was this controlled correspondence.</span> <span id="s1732">But within the Vichy Zone, yes, they had the Vichy stamps and the Petain stamps.</span> <span id="s1733">These were not the same that were used in northern France, in the occupied zone.</span> <span id="s1734">And I thus wrote to my friend that I was at this address in Blagnac, and a week or so later, I received in the mail a birth certificate which was made out to the name of Max Henri Lefévre: I was born in October of 1925, four years younger than what I was really was; and my mother's name so and so; and my father's name.</span> <span id="s1735">And I had to memorize all of this.</span> <span id="s1736">And with that birth certificate, my friend, when he sent me this, sent me also a instructions as to where to go.</span> <span id="s1737">His brother had been -- had joined that particular group that he was sending me to, sometime earlier.</span> <span id="s1738">And this was a, an underground group in the area of -- south of Lyon, in Saint-Vallier in the Department of Drôme, south of Lyon.</span> <span id="s1739">A little town on the Rhône river.</span> <span id="s1740">And I joined with the underground there in November of 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s1741">01:04:00</span></p> <p><span id="s1742">Q: Would you describe how you got there and what the group was like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1743">A: The group was composed of a microcosm of, of people who were resisting the Germans or the fascist regimes.</span> <span id="s1744">There were some people that were still hold-outs from the Spanish Civil War that had come to France -- this was seven, eight -- or six or so years later -- and had joined.</span> <span id="s1745">There were a couple of German deserters.</span> <span id="s1746">There was -- were one or two of Russians, Georgian Russians or Russian Georgians, who, who had been incorporated into the German army after the Germans entered Russia, took them captive.</span> <span id="s1747">They incorporated Ukrainians and other nationals from Russia into their armed forces.</span> <span id="s1748">So these people may have been hurt or may have been wounded and sent to France for recuperation.</span> <span id="s1749">A lot of German soldiers came to northern France to recuperate or ride out their injuries in some way.</span> <span id="s1750">Well, a couple of them then ran away and joined with the French underground because they were really against the Germans.</span> <span id="s1751">There were some people from Alsace-Lorraine, who traditionally were either violently anti-German or very much with the Germans from their nationalistic point of view.</span> <span id="s1752">But there were many Alsace-Lorraine citizens who were deeply nationalistic French.</span> <span id="s1753">These people resisted the Germans just as well.</span> <span id="s1754">And there were a few of those in the -- in that group, and a lot of Jews.</span> <span id="s1755">What was that group?</span> <span id="s1756">It was really a group called the, the Vichy French had a youth movement which was called Companion de France.</span> <span id="s1757">These people were prepared -- young people from age 17 on -- were doing crafts and, and trades.</span> <span id="s1758">Learning crafts and trades, like masonry and carpentry and plumbing and building, and that sort of thing, to prepare them for service in Germany for the new order, to be incorporated into the new order.</span> <span id="s1759">This was a Petain youth movement called Companion de France.</span> <span id="s1760">Their uniforms were blue.</span> <span id="s1761">Their berets were blue.</span> <span id="s1762">And they sang the Petain nationalistic songs in training.</span></p> <p><span id="s1763">This group took on the semblance of a Companion de France camp.</span> <span id="s1764">When we -- when I presented myself to the camp chief -- Chief of Camp, “Chief de Camp,” Maurice Bardin -- B-A-R-D-I-N -- I showed him a note that I had from my friend, showed him the birth certificate, he did not ask me any questions.</span> <span id="s1765">He says, "Welcome to our camp.</span> <span id="s1766">We will call you 'Henri.'</span> <span id="s1767">That's what we will call you."</span> <span id="s1768">And they made out the ID for us, and I was accepted as one of the, of the group.</span> <span id="s1769">This group was mainly engaged in sending messages.</span> <span id="s1770">Messages from the mountains of Savoy to Lyon, or sending emissaries up to Lyon with certain instructions as to what to do when the next German column comes by.</span> <span id="s1771">But on the surface, ostensibly, we were learning carpentry and agriculture.</span> <span id="s1772">And in the morning, we would get up at 4:30 and it was cold.</span> <span id="s1773">And I have a picture here shows the snows.</span> <span id="s1774">And we would take cold showers, because there was no warm water.</span> <span id="s1775">And after that we would have breakfast.</span> <span id="s1776">But before the cold shower, we would run a mile or two.</span> <span id="s1777">All part of the youth movement -- exercise before we start the day working.</span> <span id="s1778">But there were carpentry shops and all kinds of other.</span> <span id="s1779">So if someone would come in and observe the camp, it was a camp of Companion de France.</span> <span id="s1780">And when I circulated, I had the Companion de France uniform and ID, so that I could take a train anywhere and also not have to pay with my ID, because I was part of the Vichy government Companion de France.</span> <span id="s1781">But 80 percent of us were Jewish, hiding out; but this was a cover, and this facilitated our movements.</span> <span id="s1782">It was not until sometime the end of the year -- December, the beginning of January - -that overnight we had to clear out the facility.</span></p> <p><span id="s1783">01:10:00 The Mayor of Saint-Vallier had notified us that word has come from the French Milice -- the militia, the Vichy France collaborators with the Germans; and they were vicious, they were probably as much, if not more, vicious than the Germans -- that they will come for an inspection of the camp, of the Companion camp.</span> <span id="s1784">Evidently word had come out, or the rumor had been circulating, that there is something fishy going on there.</span> <span id="s1785">They wanted to have a firsthand view.</span> <span id="s1786">Well, when they came later, 24 hours later, the camp was empty.</span> <span id="s1787">We received our walking papers.</span> <span id="s1788">I have them here.</span> <span id="s1789">The release papers from the camp.</span> <span id="s1790">We got tickets to go into various directions.</span> <span id="s1791">I and a couple of other people was assigned to Châlus, near Limoges.</span> <span id="s1792">And we took a train to Châlus, and we arrived in Châlus and joined another underground movement there.</span> <span id="s1793">And in Châlus, in connection with the Jewish hiding out community in Limoges, we were engaged in producing false identification cards and to help children go get to the border so that they should be able to cross into Switzerland to perhaps Spain and further on to Portugal.</span> <span id="s1794">This was our main endeavor, except also putting up road blocks and doing communication between the various underground groups in the area.</span></p> <p><span id="s1795">Q: Was there -- with the first group and also with the second, you talk about extensive Jewish participation, but it's also mixed clearly with non-Jews.</span> <span id="s1796">They obviously knew you were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1797">A: It was never spelled out.</span> <span id="s1798">It was never -- it was never spelled out, the original.</span> <span id="s1799">In Limoges it was, because there I joined a group which was called "A.J." or Armée Juive.So there, the majority belonging were Zionist-oriented Jewish, although there were non-Jews who also worked with us.</span> <span id="s1800">And the Rabbi of Limoges, Abraham Deutsch, he was from Strasbourg originally.</span> <span id="s1801">He in his office was a great liaison center for all these operations, and of course, the French authorities were not aware of it at the time.</span> <span id="s1802">And in Limoges, I lived with a lady, Madame Bergot, who was hiding me and renting me an attic together with my friend, Eugene Bass, who was shot on the 10th of June, 1944.</span> <span id="s1803">And we sometime had in this attic room 12 or 15 or 20 young people staying over night, just squatting on the floor, lying down on the floor.</span> <span id="s1804">There was only one big bed, and sometimes we laid across.</span> <span id="s1805">We were lying across three, four, five people that came to Limoges just to spend the night and go on to other places.</span> <span id="s1806">And was -- and Madame Bergot knew exactly who we were, but she is probably one of the real Righteous Christians.</span></p> <p><span id="s1807">Q: Tell me about her.</span> <span id="s1808">She sounds very special.</span> <span id="s1809">01:13:40 32 Jewish Army (French).</span></p> <p><span id="s1810">A: Madame Margaret.</span> <span id="s1811">Margaret -- Marguèrite Bergot was an elderly woman in her middle to late 60s, who in the first World War after only having been married a few months, became a war widow.</span> <span id="s1812">She was a widow at 21 or 22.</span> <span id="s1813">She never remarried, but she always did things for people.</span> <span id="s1814">A gray-haired lady, whom I went to visit in 1970, when my family and I went -- no, I am sorry.</span> <span id="s1815">In 1954, when for the first time I went back with my wife to visit France.</span> <span id="s1816">We went to visit Madam Bergot, and later -- she was delighted to receive us and made us lunch.</span> <span id="s1817">And later, when my son was born, whose initials -- his name is Myron -- his initials are M.B., she made sure that she sent him a silver spoon from her set of flatware that were engraved with her initials -- Marguèrite Bergot, "M.B."</span></p> <p><span id="s1818">Q: Lovely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1819">A: She was a good lady.</span> <span id="s1820">She kept a lot of Resistance people in her attic.</span> <span id="s1821">She helped out wherever she could.</span> <span id="s1822">She made sure we had ration cards for those who couldn't get them.</span> <span id="s1823">I could, because I was living under the name of Lefévre.</span> <span id="s1824">So I got my ration cards legally and legitimately.</span> <span id="s1825">But there were some of them who did not have false papers.</span> <span id="s1826">They were hiding out, and therefore could not go to city hall and get their ration cards.</span> <span id="s1827">But Madame Bergot made sure they had either ration cards or bread -- either ration cards or coffee, or, or clothing like handkerchiefs, socks, underwear.</span> <span id="s1828">That was all rationed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1829">Q: Where did she get them?</span> <span id="s1830">How did she get them?</span> <span id="s1831">01:16:30</span></p> <p><span id="s1832">A: Madame Bergot got them!</span> <span id="s1833">She may have known somebody at city hall that knew her.</span> <span id="s1834">She would never let on as to where, but there they were.</span> <span id="s1835">When we went there in 1954, in that just few hours, my wife grew very fond of her, because you could see in that lady a -- what you might call in Jewish “eshet khayil”-- a woman of valor.</span> <span id="s1836">And that she was.</span> <span id="s1837">A beautiful person from the point of your heart and soul, and reaching out and helping.</span> <span id="s1838">That was Madam Bergot in Limoges.</span> <span id="s1839">And, of course, I first went to Châlus, as I said, but later, I relocated to Limoges, which was only about 10 or 15 -- 10 miles or so, or 10 kilometers from Châlus.</span></p> <p><span id="s1840">Although I went back quite often to Châlus to see friends and distant relatives there, I really spent my time in Limoges in 1933 into 19 -- I mean the end of '33, December -- from the end of '43 or beginning of '44, until the end of the war, in Limoges.</span> <span id="s1841">In May of 1944, I was -- I fell ill with a strangulation hernia.</span> <span id="s1842">You may recall in the earlier part of the interview that in Antwerp, I was already in the hospital to be operated on in 1940, and that never came to pass.</span> <span id="s1843">But finally, with all my escapades and all that, the, the hernia just -- a hernia doesn't heal by itself, and the hand-made truss that I had just didn't do the job anymore.</span> <span id="s1844">So one day - - one evening, walking through a park on my way to actually an orphanage to deliver some documents or papers, I -- or a message -- I just was caught by one of these attacks and lay down on a park bench and started throwing up violently until there was nothing left but bile.</span> <span id="s1845">And it so happens that a woman walked by in a nurse's hospital sister-type uniform, Red 33 Woman of valor (Hebrew).</span></p> <p><span id="s1846">Cross-type uniform.</span> <span id="s1847">And she came over and wanted to know what it was.</span> <span id="s1848">Perhaps she thought I had been drinking.</span> <span id="s1849">"You don't feel so good."</span> <span id="s1850">-- "Vous ne sentez pas bien."</span> <span id="s1851">I said, "Je sais ce que c'cest."</span> <span id="s1852">-- "I know what it is.</span> <span id="s1853">This is a hernia, and I can't push it back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1854">Normally you can try."</span> <span id="s1855">She said, "Well, what you need is a hospital."</span> <span id="s1856">And I said, "I don't think I can do that."</span> <span id="s1857">Because you go to the hospital, you being recognized as circumcised.</span> <span id="s1858">I wasn't going to take chances.</span> <span id="s1859">She says, "But at this point..." And she tries to touch my stomach; there was this tenderness and the pain with it.</span> <span id="s1860">She says, "This is an emergency!"</span> <span id="s1861">And she called the ambulance, and I was taken to the hospital.</span> <span id="s1862">And I cannot remember them actually taking my clothes off.</span> <span id="s1863">That's how fast they put anesthesia on me.</span> <span id="s1864">Already starting in the ambulance.</span> <span id="s1865">And then when I got in the operating table, I was sort of half away already.</span> <span id="s1866">And the next thing I knew was waking up the next morning in the hospital bed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1867">01:20:15 And a very nice, young religious sister -- it was a Catholic hospital by the name of Saint Joan of Arc -- bending over me and whispering in my ear after she had put a hot brick to my feet.</span> <span id="s1868">And I had a drain in my stomach, in my belly, because it had begun to almost, you know, to be infected.</span> <span id="s1869">You know, there is the situation with the strangulation hernia creates these emergency conditions.</span> <span id="s1870">Whispering into my ear, "I am in charge of this ward, so therefore you have nothing to fear."</span> <span id="s1871">Later, when I needed my documents to make a claim with the German government for certain restitutions and disability-type compensation, I had to gather papers as to all these events.</span> <span id="s1872">So I wrote to the hospital to send me a copy of, of what I had undergone, what operation, just attesting to it.</span> <span id="s1873">Well, in the letter I wrote to them, "And if Sister Joan of Arc is still with you, please tell her that I will never forget her kind words nor her cheerful whistle when she walked by the bed."</span> <span id="s1874">She was always whistling a tune.</span> <span id="s1875">A very young, attractive cheerful person.</span> <span id="s1876">And they wrote back to me that she is in Normandy, did they write?</span> <span id="s1877">Or Brittany?</span> <span id="s1878">I don't recall.</span> <span id="s1879">And if the chance will present itself, they will send her my regards and tell her how I, how I remember her.</span> <span id="s1880">I wonder where she is today.</span> <span id="s1881">Really.</span> <span id="s1882">So there is a lot of reminiscences, and there are also nice bright moments in that period of darkness.</span></p> <p><span id="s1883">01:22:48</span></p> <p><span id="s1884">Q: Let's pull it back.</span> <span id="s1885">You were released from the hospital.</span> <span id="s1886">I would like you to describe -- you went back to your Resistance work.</span> <span id="s1887">Can you describe in detail what it meant to have to take letters from one place to another?</span> <span id="s1888">What were the kinds of risks that you ran?</span> <span id="s1889">What kind of messages did you bring?</span> <span id="s1890">Where did you travel, and who did you communicate with?</span></p> <p><span id="s1891">A: I went to the hospital on May the 8th, and I was released on the May 25th.</span> <span id="s1892">That was just several days before the landing.</span> <span id="s1893">The landing took place in June -- on June the 6th, 1944.</span> <span id="s1894">In my little diary that I also have, I wrote, sometime before my release from the hospital, "I hope I will be released before the landing."</span></p> <p><span id="s1895">Q: How did you know about the landing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1896">A: Because, sometime in April or early May, we had already had in the underground, through the Radio London, messages that indicated that sometime in June, in the first couple of weeks of June, there will be major events happening, which at this time could only mean a debarkation.</span> <span id="s1897">Where it would happen, we did not know.</span> <span id="s1898">But we knew it was going to happen.</span> <span id="s1899">I did not feel that I would like to be confined when that happens, because there'll be a lot of turmoil out there.</span> <span id="s1900">There'll be a lot to do, a lot to see, a lot to be part of; and that was always my urge, to be part of something.</span> <span id="s1901">So that between that time and the actual landing, there was very little time to do whatever we had to do.</span> <span id="s1902">However, how did we feel, coming to your question about transporting.</span> <span id="s1903">First of all, we had to produce the cards.</span> <span id="s1904">We made them with false stamps and seals.</span> <span id="s1905">And we, we were counterfeiters, you see!</span> <span id="s1906">That's what we were -- just like when I escaped from that train.</span> <span id="s1907">The emergency was there, but I did it almost like a natural thing; because the urge was to be free.</span> <span id="s1908">So I did it, naturally, with all the trepidations involved.</span> <span id="s1909">But there were also trepidations in transporting papers or doing communication.</span></p> <p><span id="s1910">But at the time when we did it, the danger was not that apparent to us.</span> <span id="s1911">It's in hindsight, as you look: "What did we do?</span> <span id="s1912">My God, we were really young and...and dumb!"</span> <span id="s1913">That sort of thing.</span> <span id="s1914">But when we did it, while we did it, it did not occur to us that it was in any way endangering us.</span> <span id="s1915">Yes, anybody was endangered who did not have proper papers.</span> <span id="s1916">You could go into a restaurant as a French citizen.</span> <span id="s1917">You could go into a restaurant to have a meal and the Milicewould come in and, like random, make, make inspections or certain searches.</span> <span id="s1918">Well, if you were a Frenchman and you didn't have your IDs on you on that day and you were not involved in Resistance and you were not Jewish, you were a French farmer come to town, but you didn't have your -- any kind of ID on you; you forgot it; you neglected to take it along.</span> <span id="s1919">Even that would endanger you, because everybody had to have an ID.</span> <span id="s1920">So we were just part of a whole system of, of, of hazards and pitfalls and problems.</span> <span id="s1921">But we did not consider our activity as something that would be any more dangerous than anybody else living under that regime.</span> <span id="s1922">Although we were exposed a little more.</span> <span id="s1923">We would have been exposed a little more to the punishment, if they had found us with the cards on us, because that could mean instant death, which happened to my friend, Eugene Bass, on the 10th of June 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s1924">01:27:06</span></p> <p><span id="s1925">Q: What happened to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1926">A: That was on the same day as Oradour was burned.</span> <span id="s1927">I had been asked or instructed to go to Oradour on that Saturday to deliver some cards, and he had been instructed to go into another town that was a little further than Saint-Junien, another town nearby.</span> <span id="s1928">The German Column advanced into that area.</span> <span id="s1929">Eugene had de-- before he had delivered the cards had decided, "Let me go and visit my mother in Saint-Junien."</span> <span id="s1930">She lived there in hiding.</span> <span id="s1931">He hadn't seen her in a couple of weeks or a couple of months, or whatever.</span> <span id="s1932">He's the fellow that boarded with me.</span> <span id="s1933">Sort of blondish red hair, curly-haired fellow.</span> <span id="s1934">Eugene Bass.</span> <span id="s1935">He was from Alsace-Lorraine.</span> <span id="s1936">He went on the nom de guerre, the war name, Bastinet -- B-A-S-T-I-N-E-</span></p> <p><span id="s1937">34 Militia (French).</span></p> <p><span id="s1938">T.</span> <span id="s1939">He had gone to visit his mother in Saint-Junien.</span> <span id="s1940">He arrived in Saint-Junien rather than go into town first to deliver the cards, which was a little further.</span> <span id="s1941">Got off the train, through the station lobby, to the front door of the railroad station.</span> <span id="s1942">And the advance column of Das Reich, the Germans, were there already.</span> <span id="s1943">And everybody walking out was inspected.</span> <span id="s1944">And he had a rucksack; and in the rucksack, he had the ID cards.</span> <span id="s1945">Shot in the head!</span> <span id="s1946">His name is listed in the book deportations under those summarily executed.</span> <span id="s1947">Eugene Bass, his name is in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1948">Q: How did you find out what happened to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1949">A: He didn't come home that night.</span> <span id="s1950">He did not come home that night.</span> <span id="s1951">So a few days later we contacted, a friend and I, his mother.</span> <span id="s1952">And she had found out from someone, some witness, that he had been killed.</span> <span id="s1953">And it was through the mother that we found out that Eugene had been killed.</span> <span id="s1954">And it would have happened to me, perhaps, and others in the train that we were in on that same day, on the 10th of June, 1944, going towards Oradour-sur-Glane from Limoges, when we saw the German column, Das Reich -- or one part of the, part of the rear unit.</span> <span id="s1955">Because the advance unit had already been into Saint-Junien.</span> <span id="s1956">And when we saw parallel to the railroad track the country road where the German motorized the motorcycles and the half-tracks were heading into the direction that we were heading, rolling up all that dust, so some of us decided, "If the Germans are going into this direction, we certainly do not want to go into the same direction."</span> <span id="s1957">So before we got into Oradour, there was another halt, another station.</span> <span id="s1958">There was an electric commuter train between Saint-Junien and Limoges.</span></p> <p><span id="s1959">01:30:31 So the station before -- there were a couple of halts, stops, before we got off the train.</span> <span id="s1960">But the report on Oradour that I have on that particular sheet, the write up, says that anyone with a ticket to Oradour that got off that railroad station that particular morning was taken off and immediately machine-gunned -- just like the other 900 some citizens of Oradour.</span> <span id="s1961">The men.</span></p> <p><span id="s1962">The women and the children were taken to the church.</span> <span id="s1963">They were told they were being photographed.</span> <span id="s1964">They put bales of hay and straw around the church and put gasoline over it and destroyed the church, burned it down with the women and children in it.</span> <span id="s1965">The moans and the cries filled the air.</span> <span id="s1966">A couple of weeks later, we went back to Oradour to view the scene.</span> <span id="s1967">And we stood there crying, with the tears.</span> <span id="s1968">Tables had been set up with the remains of mementos: baby carriages, buckles, shoes, baby dolls, toys that the kids had taken with them.</span> <span id="s1969">Oradour has been built up later -- about a quarter of a mile, a half a mile further away, a new little town.</span> <span id="s1970">But the original area of Oradour is today still a shrine to be visited, to reminisce and to cry.</span> <span id="s1971">Because it was really a stroke of luck that we even noticed that column.</span> <span id="s1972">We would have gone in there.</span> <span id="s1973">The mayor of Oradour at that time, on this particular moment, was arrested, put on a table and in front of his two sons, his two legs were sawed off.</span> <span id="s1974">Reported right in the, in the, in the sheet that I have here.</span> <span id="s1975">The sons, before that happened to their father said, "Please, take us!</span> <span id="s1976">Do to us what you want to do, but not to our father!"</span> <span id="s1977">They cut off his legs, and they shot the sons, too.</span> <span id="s1978">There was just a handful of people surviving in Oradour out of 900-some people.</span> <span id="s1979">There could have been many more, because those who were hiding out without papers, that will never be known.</span> <span id="s1980">There were people hiding out.</span> <span id="s1981">A lot of Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1982">And this is exactly the place where we took some of those cards to.</span> <span id="s1983">So that they should not be in hiding continually, and also be able to move a little freer, travel here or there.</span> <span id="s1984">But at that particular time, all that was already moot because the landing had taken place, a lot of what you might call, in the Genesis terms, "tohoo va-vohoo"happened -- a lot of tumult.</span></p> <p><span id="s1985">Q: Let's back up.</span> <span id="s1986">I don't want to get to the tumult just yet.</span> <span id="s1987">I would like to stay with Oradour for a minute.</span> <span id="s1988">Did you meet any of the survivors?</span> <span id="s1989">You had come so close, you were two stations away.</span> <span id="s1990">You came after it had been burned.</span> <span id="s1991">Did you meet anyone?</span></p> <p><span id="s1992">01:34:10</span></p> <p><span id="s1993">A: No.</span> <span id="s1994">I had a call here when I wrote about this.</span> <span id="s1995">I wrote a piece to the Sun paper, recalling the event of Oradour.</span> <span id="s1996">It was in 1984, 40 years after the event, and I had a lady call me at home who told me that at one time she and her family had lived in Oradour.</span> <span id="s1997">And when she read this she had to get in touch with me.</span> <span id="s1998">But they had left Oradour before the town had been devastated.</span> <span id="s1999">In fact, it was devastated in error.</span> <span id="s2000">In the same area, there are two little towns Oradour.</span> <span id="s2001">One is called Oradour-sur-Glane, on the River Glane, near Limoges.</span> <span id="s2002">Another one, several miles away, not that great a distance, perhaps 15 kilometers or something like that.</span> <span id="s2003">I don't quite have the distance in proportion.</span> <span id="s2004">That was called Oradour-sur-Vayres.</span> <span id="s2005">Oradour- sur-Vayres had a group of Resistance fighters.</span> <span id="s2006">Oradour-sur-Glane had no Resistance fighters.</span> <span id="s2007">They had people in hiding, yes.</span> <span id="s2008">They had no arms caches.</span> <span id="s2009">Oradour-sur-Vayres did.</span> <span id="s2010">The German high command, going towards the front lines, coming from Toulouse, the Division Das Reich -- and by the way, they did a lot of damage in the town called Brive-la- Gaillarde, where they hung 90-some men from butcher hooks because of resistance activities.</span> <span id="s2011">And their families had to walk, walk by to view that.</span> <span id="s2012">That is in the Department of Corréze.</span> <span id="s2013">Limoges was, and, and Oradour was, in the Department of Haute-Vienne.</span> <span id="s2014">The German Division Das Reich had been informed, by the Milice or by some of their collaborators, that Oradour-sur-Vayres had a Resistance group, an arms cache there, and that they might hinder their progress towards the front lines.</span> <span id="s2015">The advance column of Das Reich went there to clean out that nest of resistors, so that the main columns would then have easy travel.</span> <span id="s2016">But all they knew was Oradour.</span> <span id="s2017">They looked at the map, and they saw "Oradour" on the main road between Limoges and Angoulême or wherever, and picked Oradour-sur- Glane.</span> <span id="s2018">And the Mayor said, "We have no resistance here.</span> <span id="s2019">You can search the village.</span> <span id="s2020">You can search everywhere.</span> <span id="s2021">I give you my personal guarantee with my life."</span> <span id="s2022">And it was by mistake that Oradour-sur-Glane became the victim.</span></p> <p><span id="s2023">Q: I want to take it back to events in which you were involved, okay, in which you know personally.</span> <span id="s2024">Let's go back to D-Day, June 6, 1944.</span> <span id="s2025">Where were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2026">01:37:25 35 Chaos, disorder (Hebrew).</span></p> <p><span id="s2027">A: I was in Limoges, doing my daily whatever it is, communication or whatever work I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s2028">And it was a day of euphoria.</span> <span id="s2029">The papers reported it, and people were standing in front of the newspaper buildings to read the bulletins.</span> <span id="s2030">And the Germans were running around like chickens with their heads cut off.</span> <span id="s2031">Châlus had already been liberated by the Resistance; Limoges not yet, because Limoges had a main Gestapo headquarters.</span> <span id="s2032">Châlus was a little town.</span> <span id="s2033">I also have a little sheet here that shows the liberation of Châlus, and the appeal that was made by the, by the Resistance forces to keep calm and to go on about your daily lives as usual.</span> <span id="s2034">You see, there were two types of Resistance forces in France.</span> <span id="s2035">One was the FTPF.</span> <span id="s2036">This was called Franc-Tireurs Partisans Françaises.That was like a guerilla movement.</span></p> <p><span id="s2037">And the other was called FFI, Force Français de l'Interieur -- French Forces of the Interior.</span> <span id="s2038">They were under the command of the exiled French government -- De Gaulle, in London.</span> <span id="s2039">And there was conflict between the two groups.</span> <span id="s2040">The ones that listened to De Gaulle were the ones that went by the rules, when De Gaulle and the French exiled government would give instructions: "Do not attack such and such a building..." Because that building happened to be English property.</span> <span id="s2041">So the FTPF would say: "Who cares?</span> <span id="s2042">But in that building there is armament produced that goes to the Germans."</span> <span id="s2043">So there was this conflict.</span> <span id="s2044">The FTPF was also a more radical-type movement than the FFI.</span> <span id="s2045">The FTPF, for instance, had some of the Spanish Civil War refugees.</span> <span id="s2046">They had a communist-leaning group.</span> <span id="s2047">They had more of the political activistic -- activist-type people who were fighting fascism wherever they can fight fascism, wherever they can find it.</span> <span id="s2048">The FFI was picking their targets and was going by the -- what might be called "the rules."</span> <span id="s2049">But in a unruly times, rules sometimes don't achieve anything, you see.</span> <span id="s2050">So this was the thing.</span> <span id="s2051">But we were in the streets, hoping that soon we will have liberation established in Limoges.</span> <span id="s2052">And it happened not too long afterwards, you see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2053">01:40:40</span></p> <p><span id="s2054">Q: Which of the two partisan groups were you allied with?</span></p> <p><span id="s2055">A: The A.J. was independent, actually.</span> <span id="s2056">But we were under the orders of the FTPF.</span> <span id="s2057">Yes, we were under the orders of the Franc-Tireurs Partisans.</span></p> <p><span id="s2058">Q: How were relations between the two groups?</span> <span id="s2059">A: They were very cordial.</span></p> <p><span id="s2060">Q: They were.</span></p> <p><span id="s2061">A: It was a common cause.</span> <span id="s2062">It is interesting that a common danger, how people's actions congeal, how a common danger becomes also a common denominator and an equalizer.</span> <span id="s2063">I mean, you take the London Blitz, just to divert for a minute -- 36 Free-Shooting French Partisans (French).</span></p> <p><span id="s2064">Q: Let's not.</span></p> <p><span id="s2065">A: Ok.</span></p> <p><span id="s2066">Q: I really don't want to get into that.</span> <span id="s2067">Can we pull it back?</span> <span id="s2068">Was there any feeling of antisemitism?</span> <span id="s2069">Did the A.J. feel as if the FTPF looked down on them or treated them less well because it was a Jewish group?</span></p> <p><span id="s2070">A: I would never dismiss that aspect of a, of a, of a situation where Jews are involved, because our history tells us that.</span> <span id="s2071">On the surface, it did not happen.</span> <span id="s2072">We did not feel it.</span> <span id="s2073">We did not see it in so many deeds or words.</span> <span id="s2074">But it could very well have been there, because there was one captain of the French army who worked with us.</span> <span id="s2075">He was a Viennese, actually of Polish origin, but coming from Vienna.</span> <span id="s2076">His name was Prinz.</span> <span id="s2077">And he was originally with the French Foreign Legion, then came into France to join the Resistance.</span> <span id="s2078">And he at one time indicated to me that while our main job was to fight the Nazis, if he survives the war he will have to settle a few accounts with some people, that he knew among his unit, you know.</span> <span id="s2079">And after the liberation, when the German soldiers had been arrested and interned and were in internment camps in Limoges, he took me to one of those camps to see because he was in charge of some of their units.</span> <span id="s2080">And he took me in one of those camps and he -- I got great satisfaction to see this little fellow by the name of Prinz -- he was about 5 foot 4 -- had these tall German prisoner soldiers stand at attention and act like really like scared children once they were in custody.</span> <span id="s2081">Just weeks before, days before, they were the strong, the strong masters, especially women and children.</span> <span id="s2082">And then when the day of reckoning came, they became whimpering children themselves.</span> <span id="s2083">But, no.</span> <span id="s2084">We, during our work with the Resistance, did not see it openly, feel it openly.</span> <span id="s2085">And frankly, for that nonsense, during this particular period there was no time for that.</span> <span id="s2086">We had an enemy to fight, you see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2087">01:44:33</span></p> <p><span id="s2088">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2089">The landing, June sixth, and the aftermath.</span> <span id="s2090">What did you do?</span> <span id="s2091">How did you help, if you did help, the invading American forces?</span> <span id="s2092">Was your group involved?</span></p> <p><span id="s2093">A: We were involved in -- our group was involved a little later.</span> <span id="s2094">A little later, with grave research and registration; because there had been -- for instance, we received parachuted provisions that came into the area of Limoges.</span> <span id="s2095">Certain nights when, when the message, the message, the coded message would tell us to be at a certain place at a certain time, and then there would be… We were told to send a flare at a certain time, up in the air, and then few minutes later we would have a drop off of clothing or food items.</span> <span id="s2096">The parachutes themselves would be gathered up, and the ladies would make shirts out of them.</span> <span id="s2097">They were in khaki or white or pink.</span> <span id="s2098">And in the process, in that execution of that particular parachuting help to the Resistance, some were shot down, some had to bail out for one reason or another, some were arrested.</span> <span id="s2099">And then later on, in the area a little north of Limoges, there was, of course, there was the region of Cognac, and towards the coast there were evidently fatalities.</span> <span id="s2100">After the landing in later weeks, some of our groups and us, we were involved in researching -- traveling and researching with farmers and with the countryside people who might have found soldiers, American, Canadian or British soldiers, also some of the Polish-exile forces.</span> <span id="s2101">We helped in grave research.</span> <span id="s2102">It was grave registration.</span> <span id="s2103">That's what we did, we helped.</span> <span id="s2104">Later, there were some USOhalls were established, which we helped out with.</span> <span id="s2105">But right after the landing and when Limoges was liberated, a committee was formed in Limoges.</span></p> <p><span id="s2106">01:47:30 It was called COJDASOR -- Comité Juif d'Assistance Social et Reconstruction -- the Jewish Committee for Social Assistance and Reconstruction.This was mainly geared to help refugees -- people who had lived in the area and hidden out, and could not do any kind of work during that period and really were penniless, to, to put them on their feet again.</span> <span id="s2107">OSÉ was one of the organizations connected with this.</span> <span id="s2108">The Organization for Secours aux Enfants.A children's organization, OSÉ.</span> <span id="s2109">You are familiar with that, and some of those Zionist organizations were involved, like WIZOand Hadassah.</span> <span id="s2110">And this whole program, that whole committee was supported by the American Joint Distribution Committee.</span> <span id="s2111">So we had an office in Limoges at 15 Avenue du Midi, and some of us, from our group working previously with the underground with the false ID papers, became employed by that office.</span> <span id="s2112">And as later, after liberation of Paris, which was in August of '44, and later the victory when people came back from the camps, again this Committee did a good job of, number one, helping them to get over the first hump, and later to establish themselves with a residence.</span></p> <p><span id="s2113">Even helped them find relatives, because the Committee was in touch with the Red Cross and other organizations and institutions that were, after the war, spring up here and there to just see who had survived and who can be reached.</span> <span id="s2114">And all these communication means were used to, whether it was by telegraph or radio or whatever.</span> <span id="s2115">But the COJDASOR was that committee that was established afterwards, and I worked for that.</span> <span id="s2116">But between the landing and actually the liberation, there was just a very short time.</span> <span id="s2117">Because, because France fell pretty fast to the forces of Resistance, and then the Germans were arrested.</span> <span id="s2118">And the rest took place in the north of France, of course, where the advancing Allied troops just entered Paris in August of '44.</span> <span id="s2119">And had one major scare in the winter of '44, when after the Battle of the Bulge the Germans actually advanced far enough to pose a renewed threat to Paris.</span> <span id="s2120">But that -- again, time took care of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2121">01:50:26</span></p> <p><span id="s2122">Q: But you were in Limoges.</span> <span id="s2123">Can you describe the day of liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s2124">37 United Service Organization 38 The actual name was: Comité Juif d'Action Social et de Reconstruction; Jewish Committee for Social Action and Reconstruction (French).</span></p> <p><span id="s2125">39 The name of the organization is Oeuvre de Secours aux Enfants (French), and is referred to as the Children’s Rescue Network in English.</span></p> <p><span id="s2126">40 Women’s International Zionist Organization</span></p> <p><span id="s2127">A: As I said before, it was almost an unbelievable feeling to know that the day has finally come.</span> <span id="s2128">Q: Not D-Day, June sixth, but the liberation itself.</span> <span id="s2129">When Limoges was freed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2130">A: Oh, the liberation, yeah.</span> <span id="s2131">Limoges was freed, was just another normal day, except seeing Germans patrolling the streets and Gestapo patrolling the streets and being in charge here and being in charge there, you saw columns of Gestapo and Germans being led down the street by Resistance fighters.</span> <span id="s2132">The great victorious German army led down the street by young people in rag tag outfits.</span> <span id="s2133">That was the…that was the impact.</span> <span id="s2134">Just a few weeks earlier, I was in a railroad station and saw a column...a unit of German soldiers, waiting for a train that they were taking to some direction.</span> <span id="s2135">They were sitting on the platform, on their rucksacks, on their equipment, with their guns standing up, leaning against each other, bayonets drawn, you know.</span> <span id="s2136">They have this triangular thing, arrangement there.</span> <span id="s2137">One of the soldiers was opening up -- cutting open a can of sardines with his bayonet.</span> <span id="s2138">Trying to open it up; and then he ate the sardines out of his -- out of the can, swallowing them all in all.</span> <span id="s2139">And in his language, I recognized he must have been either an Austrian or a Bavarian, because having been born in Vienna, I knew what the Austrian accent was.</span></p> <p><span id="s2140">01:53:00 And he said, in German -- which I will not tell you in German, but I will tell you that in the English translation, "The people that are walking by here," he says, "those French people here.</span> <span id="s2141">They will look at us and will say to themselves, ‘Schön schaut Sie aus, diese Reichsdeutsche Armee!'"</span> <span id="s2142">--"She sure looks good, that victorious German army!"</span> <span id="s2143">In a facetious way.</span> <span id="s2144">And when we saw those German prisoners walking down the main street of -- with their arms raised on top of their heads, disarmed…that came to my mind.</span> <span id="s2145">"You look good, you victorious German Army!</span> <span id="s2146">Now that you are guarded by a rag tag outfit, you act like you are the victims."</span> <span id="s2147">Or something like that.</span> <span id="s2148">That was the main impact.</span> <span id="s2149">And that picture, that -- imagine that scene repeated itself over and over in France in all the little villages and towns that became liberated, one by one by one.</span> <span id="s2150">The collaborators were arrested, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s2151">Unfortunately, there was also during that period a lot of spur of the moment, perhaps hasty, emotional reaction to those that we, the underground had perceived as being collaborators, like selling, dealing black market, or cohorting or fraternizing with some of the German officers -- including some of the people that we had known, our own people.</span> <span id="s2152">And it was not uncommon for someone whom we knew who did black market, even if they were Jewish, to be executed actually without trial, without jury, without due process.</span> <span id="s2153">But the emotions were so high that these things happened in I wouldn't just say a few cases.</span> <span id="s2154">There were quite -- there were many.</span></p> <p><span id="s2155">Q: Leo, we have five minutes left.</span> <span id="s2156">I think it makes sense to wrap it up in this hour rather than go to another tape.</span> <span id="s2157">Tell me what, very briefly, I want to save a few minutes for pictures.</span> <span id="s2158">But tell 41 “She looks beautiful, that German Army” (German).</span></p> <p><span id="s2159">me, after the war, you were involved in this organization.</span> <span id="s2160">How did you get to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s2161">A: I had an aunt in Baltimore, who already in 1941 had sent me papers to...the affidavit to join her here in America.</span> <span id="s2162">But with the advent of the Pearl Harbor and America entering the war, those documents expired, fell by the wayside.</span> <span id="s2163">In 1946, I received new papers, new affidavits, from my aunt here in Baltimore.</span> <span id="s2164">I applied for the right to immigrate to the United States, and I joined here my aunt here in 1947.</span> <span id="s2165">I have a sheet here that shows that I was on a preferential quota -- I was born in Austria.</span> <span id="s2166">And also, one that my travel to the United States is in the national interest of the United States, simply because I worked for that group that did grave registration and I was also involved in the postal censor, postal censor service in Paris later, under the guidance of a army lieutenant, Sonja Beaumont.</span> <span id="s2167">A lady.</span> <span id="s2168">I was with the postal censor service for a little while in Paris.</span> <span id="s2169">I spoke several languages, and so I was a few months there in that capacity.</span> <span id="s2170">So I came to the United States in 1947.</span></p> <p><span id="s2171">Q: And you married?</span></p> <p><span id="s2172">A: I married in America.</span> <span id="s2173">Married an American young woman in 1952, and we have three children.</span> <span id="s2174">And in January of this year, we became grandparents for the first time, and that is the -- that's good ending to the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s2175">Q: Wonderful ending to the story.</span> <span id="s2176">01:57:49 End of Tape #4</span></p> <p><span
