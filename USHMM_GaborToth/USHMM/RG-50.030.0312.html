agreement that when we live through the war, we were going to meet in Krakau.</span> <span id="s1197">So me and my sister-in-law, his sister, and my brother-in-law and his wife, and we all went on the way to -- there were no trains.</span> <span id="s1198">I remember on the way we stole a horse and a platform, you know, like a wagon, and we went to the next town, where there was a little train going.</span> <span id="s1199">We went on this train, and then we went to Czekloslovakia.</span> <span id="s1200">The Czeks treated us very nicely.</span> <span id="s1201">They took us to a school,

days, but we made it.</span> <span id="s1205">So then I was in Krakau, and I was together with a girlfriend, and I went to this apartment where I used to live when the war broke out.</span> <span id="s1206">And I spoke to the lady, and I said, I have no money, but I am a dressmaker by profession, so if you would let me have a room, I will try to make some money.</span> <span id="s1207">I will pay you, and she did.</span> <span id="s1208">She did.</span> <span id="s1209">And I was living there, and I was living already a little bit human life, my facilities.</span> <span id="s1210">I was living with my girlfriend together, and we started to sew.</span> <span id="s1211">We got some woman, and we sold dresses, blouses, shirts, whatever it was, and we made some money.</span> <span id="s1212">And my husband, he didn't come.</span> <span id="s1213">And one day my sister-in-law called me downstairs, and she said, there is a newspaper, there came a newspaper from Munich.</span> <span id="s1214">Regards to the families in Poland from the prisoners from Dachau.</span> <span id="s1215">And between all the names, there were Henry Rosner and his ten-year-old son.</span> <span id="s1216">So when I was reading that, I said, I am going to go to Munich.</span> <span id="s1217">So my girlfriend says she is going with me.</span> <span id="s1218">So we made ourselves on the way, because, maybe, I don't know, once we went and then we went back, we couldn't go any further.</span> <span id="s1219">Then we went again.</span> <span id="s1220">It took me maybe two weeks.</span> <span id="s1221">Well, there was no trains going directly or something, some parts had the trains, some parts didn't have it yet.</span> <span id="s1222">We had to walk.</span> <span id="s1223">We had to try to get some communication with some English soldiers or some French soldiers, wherever we could find them.</span> <span id="s1224">So we went there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">Q.</span> <span id="s1226">So you found your way to Munich?</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">A.
