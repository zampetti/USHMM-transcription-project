Auxiliary of the Jewish Community Centers of Chicago</span></p> <p><span id="s11">NAME: ELEONORA KHAZAN DATE: August 30, 1990 INTERVIEWERS: Saralyn Levine and Margot Hirsch (Where were you born?</span> <span id="s12">and the date?)</span> <span id="s13">I was born in Kiev, April 28, 1959.</span> <span id="s14">I was the only child.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">(Let's go to your earliest memories.</span> <span id="s16">You were alone in the house with your parents.</span> <span id="s17">Were your parents working?</span> <span id="s18">Who took care of you?)</span> <span id="s19">Both of my parents worked, and I was in Kindergarten.</span> <span id="s20">From the age of one year, I went to Kindergarten.</span> <span id="s21">I had my grandmother who lived with us, but she was working also.</span> <span id="s22">So nobody could care for me, only the government!</span></p> <p><span id="s23">(Was this like a day care center?</span> <span id="s24">How young did they take children to care for?)</span> <span id="s25">Yes, they took care of the children all day.</span> <span id="s26">When I was a child, they took the children from six months old.</span> <span id="s27">Now, it is from one year old.</span> <span id="s28">My daughter went from the age of one year and was happy in the Kindergarten.</span> <span id="s29">You have heard how they live in Russia?</span> <span id="s30">Maybe five percent of the mothers sit with their children all the others are working.</span> <span id="s31">It is very hard to live with only one salary.</span> <span id="s32">So most mothers work.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">(So, when you were little, your grandmother lived with you but she worked too, and you only saw her in the evening, at night?)</span> <span id="s34">She was my mother's mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">(Did she talk about her life and the life before her.</span> <span id="s36">Do you have any sense of your grandparents' lives and maybe even your great-grandparents?)</span> <span id="s37">My grandmother had a really hard life so she didn't like to talk a lot about her life, but I heard some --.</span> <span id="s38">She talked sometimes about her life, about her parents.</span> <span id="s39">She loved her parents and she showed me a picture of her parents, it was a very, very old picture.</span> <span id="s40">And she could keep them during the Second World War.</span> <span id="s41">So I did know something about my great-grandparents but it is not a lot!</span></p> <p><span id="s42">(Where did they live?)</span> <span id="s43">They lived in Kiev.</span> <span id="s44">At least for two generations they lived there, I don't know about before that.</span> <span id="s45">It is strange but they were like farmers!</span> <span id="s46">My great-grandfather, the father of my grandmother, worked for the owner of a forest.</span> <span id="s47">He managed the forest, tending it, protecting it, selling the wood and like that.</span> <span id="s48">The forest was near to Kiev, and he lived near Kiev, and maybe during the winter, two times a week he came to be with his family.</span> <span id="s49">In the summertime, the family came to his home in the forest.</span> <span id="s50">That was nice.</span> <span id="s51">Yes, this was before the 1917 Revolution.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">My grandmother had only one child, my mother.</span> <span id="s53">But she had a lot of sisters!</span> <span id="s54">And one brother.</span> <span id="s55">(Was it a policy after the Revolution to have small families?)</span> <span id="s56">No, no.</span> <span id="s57">I think people did it out of their own feelings.</span> <span id="s58">It was a very hard life, especially for Jewish people.</span> <span id="s59">So that is when I think there began to be not more than two children in a Jewish family.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">(As you were growing up, what do you remember about what a normal day was like, who your friends were, about early school?)</span> <span id="s61">A normal day was to wake up and go to the school and about three o'clock I would come home.</span> <span id="s62">I attended not only the regular school but also music school.</span> <span id="s63">So, sometimes, when I was a little girl - like in second or third grade - my grandmother (my other grandmother, from my father's side) took me to the music school.</span> <span id="s64">I had piano lessons, but music school in Russia is different than an American music education.</span> <span id="s65">It is not only piano lessons, but music history and hearing, and chorus, singing together, it is everything!</span> <span id="s66">(How do you know it is different here?</span> <span id="s67">Stan) I checked here, here they give lessons.</span> <span id="s68">I was interested in this for Julia so I asked a lot of questions!</span></p> <p><span id="s69">(In music school, there must have been a lot of Jewish students because it is a sort of Jewish thing to do.)</span> <span id="s70">Right.</span> <span id="s71">In all Jewish families it is like a necessity for them to keep their children busy!</span> <span id="s72">Usually with music, it is a violin or a piano.</span> <span id="s73">It is a cultural thing, right.</span> <span id="s74">I am very obliged to my parents that they did this for me.</span> <span id="s75">Yes.</span> <span id="s76">Some days I wanted to give it up, but I didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">I went to regular school every day and to music school about three times a week, then I did homework.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">(Did you have any special jobs around the house, that were your jobs?)</span> <span id="s79">When I was a small girl, of course not.</span> <span id="s80">But after I was eleven or twelve, when my parents - my mother asked me, but I wasn't willing to do that.</span> <span id="s81">I should have!</span> <span id="s82">Something like cleaning, things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">(What was your home like, was it an apartment?</span> <span id="s84">how many rooms did it have?)</span> <span id="s85">We had a two-room apartment, very similar to Stan's apartment.</span> <span id="s86">Two rooms for four people, three generations!</span> <span id="s87">When I was born, my parents and my grandmother lived in a one room apartment - eight meters by eight meters.</span> <span id="s88">I learned to walk on the bed because we didn't have enough space for me to walk because of all the furniture!</span> <span id="s89">This story about my walking on the bed is like family history!</span></p> <p><span id="s90">But when I was about two years my grandmother got this two-room apartment.</span> <span id="s91">They were so happy!</span> <span id="s92">They were happy not only for the larger apartment but because the air was really good.</span> <span id="s93">It was really good air there and there were a lot of Jews.</span> <span id="s94">Yes.</span> <span id="s95">A lot of Jews meant that in our house, our apartment house, we had like five Jewish families.</span> <span id="s96">It means a lot to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">(Were you close to them?</span> <span id="s98">Did you celebrate holidays together?</span> <span id="s99">Did you celebrate any holidays?)</span> <span id="s100">We celebrated Pesach always.</span> <span id="s101">(Did you have a Seder?)</span> <span id="s102">Yes, the little man down in the front of our apartment, we were very close to him.</span> <span id="s103">He would invite us.</span> <span id="s104">But what celebration?</span> <span id="s105">It meant just to have dinner, it is not going to synagogue to special service - no!</span> <span id="s106">We had special foods like hamantaschen, not for Pesach, but we celebrated Purim too!</span> <span id="s107">But it wasn't much.</span> <span id="s108">I remember.</span> <span id="s109">We ate matzohs for the week, but we ate bread too, not only matzoh.</span> <span id="s110">We had no special prayers at the dinner, it was not that kind of Seder.</span> <span id="s111">We called all our very close relatives and congratulated them, and they congratulated us, but it was only a dinner.</span> <span id="s112">We knew it was a holiday, but we did not have all the religious service for dinner.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">We always had fish - gefilte fish - on all the Jewish holidays.</span> <span id="s114">My grandmother usually made this; sometimes my mother, but usually my grandmother.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">(What kind of work did your grandmother do?)</span> <span id="s116">You mean her occupation?</span> <span id="s117">She was like an accountant.</span> <span id="s118">My mother is an engineer, and my father too.</span> <span id="s119">My father is a mechanical engineer; and my mother was in construction estimator engineer.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">(Which brings us up to you - no, let's first talk about high school and - .</span> <span id="s121">You knew you were Jewish your whole life because you had your special friends; and your holidays.)</span> <span id="s122">I couldn't say to you that I learned this at any one time --.</span> <span id="s123">Not just because I had Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s124">Actually, I always had one Jewish friend; and a few Gentile friends.</span> <span id="s125">I think that I knew that I was a Jew since I was four or five years old.</span> <span id="s126">From children, in our yard, the children from our house, when we played together.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">(What did they say?</span> <span id="s128">what did they do?)</span> <span id="s129">They would say an offensive word for me so I couldn't not know.</span> <span id="s130">Actually, we were not very close friends, but we had friendly relations.</span> <span id="s131">Sometimes you know when children argue, then this word would come out.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">(Did you tell your parents about this?</span> <span id="s133">did you discuss it?)</span> <span id="s134">I felt bad about this name calling.</span> <span id="s135">But, actually, my parents said - what can you do?</span> <span id="s136">say something offensive to them?</span> <span id="s137">So I said something offensive to them!</span></p> <p><span id="s138">(So then you went from the primary school to something like our high school?</span> <span id="s139">Were you with more people then?</span> <span id="s140">because when we go to high school it covers a larger area, is it the same there?)</span> <span id="s141">No.</span> <span id="s142">Because the high school and the elementary school are in the same building.</span> <span id="s143">It is just the same school, with the same people, with the same teachers, from First Grade up to Tenth.</span> <span id="s144">You are with the same teachers and all the same pupils for the whole time.</span> <span id="s145">Elementary School is just for ten years.</span> <span id="s146">The only new people were students who had moved from another area into our area.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">(At what age did you finish Tenth Grade?)</span> <span id="s148">Seventeen?</span> <span id="s149">Yes, seventeen.</span> <span id="s150">Then I entered college, not the university.</span> <span id="s151">We have two different types of colleges.</span> <span id="s152">Just like the Institute of Engineers is not a university program.</span> <span id="s153">I was in the Institute, it was a technical school.</span> <span id="s154">That was my decision.</span> <span id="s155">Actually, I wanted to enter another school, but I knew that I couldn't co that!</span> <span id="s156">(Why?)</span> <span id="s157">Because I am a Jew.</span> <span id="s158">I knew that I couldn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">I wanted to be a teacher and I wanted to enter a teacher's college, but I didn't even make an application.</span> <span id="s160">I just knew from other people that it was very hard to enter this Institute, especially for Jews.</span> <span id="s161">My college, which I entered, had a better reputation for accepting Jews because it wasn't a very prestigious college!</span></p> <p><span id="s162">My college was a Construction College.</span> <span id="s163">I didn't want to be a Construction Engineer, but I was lucky because in this college they just opened a new course, a Computer Science course.</span> <span id="s164">And I really wanted to be a programmer, so I was really lucky because not all people knew about this new course so they didn't have a big competition - we had only three people apply for each place.</span> <span id="s165">This is not a BIG competition, that is why not three or five percent, but maybe ten percent of the people in this course were Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Then, after a few years, it was very hard to enter this college for Jews, because more people knew about this and it became a more prestigious school because computer programming is really a prestigious education in Russia.</span> <span id="s167">(Were you learning on Russian made computers?)</span> <span id="s168">Yes.</span> <span id="s169">They were comparable to what I have seen here, sophisticated.</span> <span id="s170">But I think that, the programmers there say that the technology, the hardware, is from the West and that it is copied.</span> <span id="s171">They copy the Western technology and just make it in the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s172">The programming is in English.</span> <span id="s173">The programming languages like here, COBOL, SYLVAN, everything is the same - it is in English!</span></p> <p><span id="s174">(Did they have enough equipment that everyone had their own computer?)</span> <span id="s175">No.</span> <span id="s176">We had it in a lab, and we had only a few hours a week to do something with computers.</span> <span id="s177">We had a schedule for the people in our group to use the equipment.</span> <span id="s178">There were three of us in our group, so we each got to use the lab equipment for about two or three hours a week.</span> <span id="s179">It was funny, it is hard to study computers if you only have two hours a week, right?</span> <span id="s180">Then when I worked, we had maybe two or three hours a day to work with computers.</span> <span id="s181">We did not have a computer terminal on our desk, like here.</span> <span id="s182">We had the same sort of schedule and we had two or three hours a day, only to work and then you should know it.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">(How long was the class program for learning computer programming?)</span> <span id="s184">Around six years, five and a half years.</span> <span id="s185">For two years we studied, like, technical subjects, common technical subjects.</span> <span id="s186">Then we studied the computer sciences.</span> <span id="s187">It was very thorough.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">(You've seen Julie in school here now, how do you compare the educational system?)</span> <span id="s189">We think that the Russian education system is better, at least for younger children.</span> <span id="s190">College education is probably better here.</span> <span id="s191">But elementary education was much better there.</span> <span id="s192">(Why?</span> <span id="s193">because they teach more subjects, or they teach it more thoroughly?)</span> <span id="s194">They teach more subjects in Russia, and it is much more intensive.</span> <span id="s195">(And they are more serious, there is not so much time to play?)</span> <span id="s196">Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">(You were living at home when you went to this college, yes?</span> <span id="s198">Did you have holidays?</span> <span id="s199">Did you have vacations and things like that?)</span> <span id="s200">Yes.</span> <span id="s201">It is the same as the schools here.</span> <span id="s202">Winter vacation and then summer vacation for two or three months.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">(Did you go away with your family, on vacations?)</span> <span id="s204">Yes.</span> <span id="s205">The point is that after my first year in college, my father was very sick and couldn't leave the city.</span> <span id="s206">So I had vacation with my girlfriend and her mother.</span> <span id="s207">We went to Crimea, to a resort.</span> <span id="s208">The second year's vacation I spent with an admirer!</span></p> <p><span id="s209">(So you married very young!?)</span> <span id="s210">Yes, I was just twenty.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">(Where did you and Stan meet?)</span> <span id="s212">We met in Kiev in a friend's house.</span> <span id="s213">It was kind of quiet, not a holiday or anything, just a get-together.</span> <span id="s214">I think you already talked about us with Stan?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">(Yes, but now I want your side.</span> <span id="s216">How did you feel about him, when you first met him?)</span> <span id="s217">I don't know, I did not imagine that he was going to be my husband!</span> <span id="s218">It was Okay.</span> <span id="s219">(Did he pursue you?)</span> <span id="s220">Maybe the second time we met, not the first time.</span> <span id="s221">(How long did you know each other before you got married?)</span> <span id="s222">We knew each other for about one year.</span> <span id="s223">But it wasn't like a full year, we didn't get to meet very often.</span> <span id="s224">You know he did not live in Kiev, and with my job very often I was working at another city.</span> <span id="s225">He was in Kiev and we might meet very often and then he went back to his city and we didn't meet for a long time.</span> <span id="s226">(Did your write back and forth?)</span> <span id="s227">Write?</span> <span id="s228">No.</span> <span id="s229">Just by phone.</span> <span id="s230">I don't like to write letter - but I like to receive them!</span> <span id="s231">This is why I have to write them.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">(When you decided to get married?</span> <span id="s233">Was it important that you met each other's families before you got married?)</span> <span id="s234">Yes.</span> <span id="s235">It is a typical Jewish family tradition.</span> <span id="s236">It is important not only to meet him but also to meet his family.</span> <span id="s237">And the same with me.</span> <span id="s238">His parents did not only want to see me, they also wanted to meet my parents.</span> <span id="s239">What kind of family one comes from, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">(We talked before about the importance of marrying someone Jewish.</span> <span id="s241">Did you know this from your childhood, or how did this evolve with you?)</span> <span id="s242">I think that for me it was more important that a man was either a good guy or a not so good guy.</span> <span id="s243">And I really didn't think it should always be for sure a Jew.</span> <span id="s244">But then I was so young, and now I understand that it is really important!</span> <span id="s245">But when I was like seventeen or eighteen years old, what was important was whether he was a good guy or not.</span> <span id="s246">But I know exactly that my parents would not accept a non-Jewish man.</span> <span id="s247">I know this exactly!</span></p> <p><span id="s248">We were married in 1979.</span> <span id="s249">(Where did you live when you got married?)</span> <span id="s250">At that time my grandmother got an apartment (my mother's mother), she had been living with us altogether and she got a one-room apartment.</span> <span id="s251">Then we just exchanged.</span> <span id="s252">We went to live in the one-room apartment she had, and she came back to live with my mother and father!</span></p> <p><span id="s253">So when she was about fifty or sixty years old she got a new apartment, one-room; it is like a studio apartment here.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">(Is it easy to just switch apartments?)</span> <span id="s255">No, it is not easy; but for families it is not hard.</span> <span id="s256">But we should have a reason to do this.</span> <span id="s257">But we didn't do this legally.</span> <span id="s258">She moved into the new apartment and then she moved back and we moved in.</span> <span id="s259">But we didn't do this paperwork.</span> <span id="s260">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">(When you're assigned these apartments, who do you pay the rent to?)</span> <span id="s262">The government.</span> <span id="s263">(Is there an agency that collects all this?)</span> <span id="s264">It is like the currency exchange is here.</span> <span id="s265">We just go to this place, like a currency exchange - like you send a money order!</span></p> <p><span id="s266">(I wondered, did you work before you were married?)</span> <span id="s267">No.</span> <span id="s268">I just studied at the college.</span> <span id="s269">I was still a student when we were married.</span> <span id="s270">Stan was working.</span> <span id="s271">(so, you moved to Kiev at that time?)</span> <span id="s272">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">(So you were very fortunate, as a young married couple to get this apartment?)</span> <span id="s274">Yes, we were envied by all our friends, to be able to live separately.</span> <span id="s275">They had to move in with their parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">(What is the general feeling about having to live with one's parents after you are married?)</span> <span id="s277">This makes a lot of bad feelings.</span> <span id="s278">Nobody is happy to live with their parents, of our friends, because it is a different generation, you know.</span> <span id="s279">At ten o'clock, for example, parents want to sleep, children want to watch television, or to have their friends, to study, so it increases the tension.</span> <span id="s280">And if you have children, the grandparents always have different ideas about how to raise children.</span> <span id="s281">It is not good.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">(How long were you married, when Julia arrived?)</span> <span id="s283">Two and a half years, about.</span> <span id="s284">Almost three years.</span> <span id="s285">When I had graduated college.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">(Were you working at all when you were a student?)</span> <span id="s287">No, I was a full time student.</span> <span id="s288">I finished school three years after we were married.</span> <span id="s289">Julia was born just after I graduated.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">(Now, let's talk about your work for a while.</span> <span id="s291">After you graduated college, do they help you find a job or are you on your own?)</span> <span id="s292">Actually, they have and should have more programs to help you find a job.</span> <span id="s293">It is different from the American system.</span> <span id="s294">How to explain that?</span> <span id="s295">(They have a special list of companies who needed the students, -Stan) especially from this college program, because we were very few.</span> <span id="s296">And the college will send you to these companies and you have to work for them for three years.</span> <span id="s297">And they don't have a choice.</span> <span id="s298">The graduate should go direct to that company and work there for three years!</span> <span id="s299">I feel this is a bad system.</span> <span id="s300">Some companies are very good but - (sometimes you are not happy-Stan) especially if the company is in another area, and you have to move to another city and you have no place to live, no friends, nobody, in another Republic, for example.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">So, it is a big problem and now a lot of students don't want to go to the companies where they were assigned and there has been some trouble.</span> <span id="s302">(Where was the place they sent you?)</span> <span id="s303">In Kiev.</span> <span id="s304">Because I was married and they have a law that for married students, if schools work in this city, they could not send me to another city.</span> <span id="s305">(Good!)</span> <span id="s306">(Now you are finished your education and beginning to work.</span> <span id="s307">During this time, do you remember feeling any kind of political pressures on you?)</span> <span id="s308">We always felt political pressures, because all our lives we studied political subjects.</span> <span id="s309">So, we should talk only this way, like it says in the textbook.</span> <span id="s310">It is a kind of pressure, I couldn't explain what I was feeling.</span> <span id="s311">I could not ask questions, couldn't say my opinion, I just could say what I had read in the book!</span> <span id="s312">This is a kind of pressure.</span> <span id="s313">And I didn't want to study this subject at all!</span> <span id="s314">It wasn't interesting to me.</span> <span id="s315">Maybe, if I compare the hours, in college, that I spent studying the political subjects and the hours I spent studying the computer, I think maybe the political subjects took up more of my student time!</span></p> <p><span id="s316">(What about History?</span> <span id="s317">We're led to believe here that Russian History is taught, not quite accurately.)</span> <span id="s318">Right.</span> <span id="s319">Especially after the Revolution, the Communists Period.</span> <span id="s320">I knew from my childhood that it wasn't true what I studied in school.</span> <span id="s321">(How did you know that?)</span> <span id="s322">From my parents, from my father.</span> <span id="s323">He was very interested -he is now very interested in History.</span> <span id="s324">He wanted to be an historian but he tried to enter the university, the college, for History course, but he could not enter.</span> <span id="s325">He knew a lot about History.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">(What kind of work did your father do?)</span> <span id="s327">He was a mechanical engineer.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">(Was he old enough at the time to have been in World War II, or not?)</span> <span id="s329">No, he was a child.</span> <span id="s330">My mother's father was killed during this war.</span> <span id="s331">And she doesn't even remember him well, because she was only three years old.</span> <span id="s332">And she didn't have much time to get to know him because even before the war, he was a professional pilot.</span> <span id="s333">So she doesn't remember much.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">My father's father participated in this war.</span> <span id="s335">And he finished his service.</span> <span id="s336">He had a bad leg from the war, he was wounded.</span> <span id="s337">Actually he died because of this wound, every year he was supposed to go to the hospital for some medical course.</span> <span id="s338">One year when he went to the hospital, he got an infection, (gangrene?)</span> <span id="s339">Yes.</span> <span id="s340">He died when I was maybe seven or eight years old.</span> <span id="s341">(1965, or 1966) (Was your father's mother in Kiev with you?)</span> <span id="s342">Yes, she was in Kiev.</span> <span id="s343">I don't know what kind of work she did, actually, she didn't work for a long time after the war.</span> <span id="s344">She took care of my father and her youngest son.</span> <span id="s345">She worked like a tailor some years later.</span> <span id="s346">But that was was not a full-time job.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">(Did they get a pension?</span> <span id="s348">Did the government pay her when your grandfather died?)</span> <span id="s349">No, because it wasn't war time and even my other grandmother, my mother's mother didn't get any pension.</span> <span id="s350">Nothing, nothing.</span> <span id="s351">She had really a hard time because she had to work in two jobs, because she raised my mother without any help at all.</span> <span id="s352">She worked really hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">(Did your other grandmother come to your house to celebrate holidays with you?)</span> <span id="s354">Yes, she did, and sometimes we went to her house.</span> <span id="s355">She lived in a common apartment.</span> <span id="s356">She had two rooms.</span> <span id="s357">And this apartment had maybe seven or eight rooms so she shared this apartment with other families.</span> <span id="s358">Common kitchen, common bathroom; so it was really hard to celebrate some holidays because she was the only Jew in the apartment.</span> <span id="s359">And sometimes she had trouble with her neighbor.</span> <span id="s360">(Because she was a Jew?)</span> <span id="s361">Not just that but it is hard to share a kitchen and prepare for a holiday with strange people!</span> <span id="s362">Of course, sometimes they had problems!</span> <span id="s363">After all, they were not family or relatives!</span></p> <p><span id="s364">(Well, now I think we are up to your working - you have gone to this place where they told you that you had to work?)</span> <span id="s365">Yes, but I was lucky because I had practice after every year at our college, before summer vacation, we had one month's practice, like training.</span> <span id="s366">So we couldn't choose a company, of course, but one year I got this training in this company.</span> <span id="s367">And I thought it was a really good place to work, because there were a lot of Jews!</span></p> <p><span id="s368">(What kind of a place was it?</span> <span id="s369">I know you did computer programming.)</span> <span id="s370">It was like a consulting company, it worked for clients, and the clients were construction companies.</span> <span id="s371">And this is why I got training in this company, because I was in a Construction Institute!</span> <span id="s372">So they prepared specialist computer programmers to work in the construction field!</span></p> <p><span id="s373">(What did they construct?)</span> <span id="s374">Everything - commercial buildings; housing.</span> <span id="s375">(Did they get government - everything was government projects, wasn't it?</span> <span id="s376">At this point was Gorbachev in power?)</span> <span id="s377">No.</span> <span id="s378">Not yet.</span> <span id="s379">I graduated college in 1981 and after training, I asked my training boss in the company to ask my boss in the Institute to give me a job in this company!</span> <span id="s380">So, nobody wanted to work in this company - I don't know why.</span> <span id="s381">So, it was perfect for me!!</span></p> <p><span id="s382">(How big of a place was it?</span> <span id="s383">How many people worked at the company?)</span> <span id="s384">Around three hundred people in our company.</span> <span id="s385">Our department consisted of maybe fifty people.</span> <span id="s386">And our group was around fifteen to eighteen people.</span> <span id="s387">And about 70% of the people there were Jews.</span> <span id="s388">They were also my age.</span> <span id="s389">Now it isn't!</span></p> <p><span id="s390">(Did you bring some of them home and have a social life with some of them?)</span> <span id="s391">We had a very good team.</span> <span id="s392">Not just good workers but friendly.</span> <span id="s393">But now a few of them live in Israel, and a few of them live in America, and some of them moved to another company.</span> <span id="s394">Now there are only a few Jews left in our department.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">(What were working conditions like?</span> <span id="s396">What time did you get there?</span> <span id="s397">What were the hours?)</span> <span id="s398">We worked from eight to five.</span> <span id="s399">Sometimes I had second shift which was from one or two o'clock - after lunch -to nine or ten at night.</span> <span id="s400">Actually, they had one shift, but sometimes they had problems with the computers, because we had too many people and not enough computers!</span> <span id="s401">So when we have scheduled to work after five, we just needed to go the second shift.</span> <span id="s402">I worked at this company until we left Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">(Now let's talk about - and I really want to get into your thoughts and feelings in this area - your decision to leave the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s404">What was happening politically at the time?</span> <span id="s405">Just tell us about everything from the first moment you thought this might be a good idea for you.</span> <span id="s406">How did all this start?)</span> <span id="s407">About the decision?</span> <span id="s408">(Yes) We wanted to leave when we first got married.</span> <span id="s409">Even before we got married, my family had made this decision - in 1978 or 1977, 1977.</span> <span id="s410">And then when we got married the special invitations came from Israel, and we needed to have this invitation not only for my family but now also for Stan's family.</span> <span id="s411">So just, while we needed this invitation, actually we got this invitation, but before we had time to leave Russia because in 1979 they closed the emigration so we couldn't leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">(Who sent you the affidavit?)</span> <span id="s413">Everybody, not relatives, you know - but acquaintances, friends of acquaintances, friends of relatives - we asked everybody!</span> <span id="s414">(You had to do this all personally?</span> <span id="s415">there isn't an agency that you could contact in Israel?)</span> <span id="s416">Oh no, that is illegal!</span> <span id="s417">You know, somebody would leave Russia and we would give them our data, you know, and we know, - my grandmother said, maybe more than ten invitations!</span> <span id="s418">My parents didn't get anything, just -- which was really awful, you know.</span> <span id="s419">Because we had asked a lot of people and she knew that these people did send us invitations and only my grandmother received this invitation - not my parents!</span></p> <p><span id="s420">I don't know why this was, but we know exactly that the government doesn't want to give out the invitations.</span> <span id="s421">Because the same people sent in, on the same day, the invitation for grandmother, and for my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">(And they were people that she knew as friends from before?)</span> <span id="s423">Right.</span> <span id="s424">And my grandmother received all the invitations but not my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">(So this was the end of the seventies, and you had the piece of paper but they closed the doors?)</span> <span id="s426">(Did you keep those papers?)</span> <span id="s427">Right!</span> <span id="s428">And it helped us to go this time to America.</span> <span id="s429">We didn't need to wait for new invitation.</span> <span id="s430">We just used our older invitations and in 1988 we left.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">(They closed it in 1979, under Brezhnev, did you know why they closed it?)</span> <span id="s432">Because of Afghanistan.</span> <span id="s433">Actually we didn't know.</span> <span id="s434">At the time they didn't say that.</span> <span id="s435">But people talked about that with friends and relatives, and everybody knew that it was because of Afghanistan.</span> <span id="s436">(They told us that because we were married, and that they would get some American technology.</span> <span id="s437">So, they traded us!</span> <span id="s438">- Stan) Yes!</span> <span id="s439">But my uncle told me that they had economical sanctions, America, and Brezhnev closed the door.</span> <span id="s440">It was like, "You don't want to give us that?</span> <span id="s441">We won't permit Jews to leave our country!"</span> <span id="s442">(So, you wanted to leave for several years but you just couldn't?)</span> <span id="s443">Well, we didn't apply again until we knew the doors were open again, and we really didn't believe that it would open again!</span></p> <p><span id="s444">(When did Gorbachev come in?)</span> <span id="s445">He came in 1984 or 1985.</span> <span id="s446">(Did you notice changes at that time?</span> <span id="s447">In your daily life, in your television?)</span> <span id="s448">I didn't feel any changes, I didn't believe there would be any changes.</span> <span id="s449">I got more cynical.</span> <span id="s450">Let's say things became more interesting for us.</span> <span id="s451">We got more books to read, more news in the newspapers, many books we could not read before.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">(What kind of books?)</span> <span id="s453">Oh, we had a lot of writers who government censor didn't permit us to read.</span> <span id="s454">So, under Gorbachev's political changes, it was permitted to read these books.</span> <span id="s455">There were a lot of things.</span> <span id="s456">You know Pasternak's Doctor Zhivago?</span> <span id="s457">legally we couldn't read it.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">(Could you get a copy of it from underground?</span> <span id="s459">before it was legal?)</span> <span id="s460">Doctor Zhivago?</span> <span id="s461">Not the whole book, we got something of it.</span> <span id="s462">Even from Israel we had some copies, Exodus by Leon Uris, we read that, we had only two days for this book!</span> <span id="s463">(You had to pass it around?)</span> <span id="s464">Right!</span> <span id="s465">So we read very hard - by day and by night!</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Another book, it wasn't like Exodus, it was more about Jewish history.</span> <span id="s467">It was a very interesting book.</span> <span id="s468">We also had it only two days and we didn't get a chance to finish it.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">(Was there a whole network of stuff like this going on before Gorbachev?</span> <span id="s470">A sort of underground?)</span> <span id="s471">Oh yes.</span> <span id="s472">It depends on the neighborhood and the people with whom you work and communicate.</span> <span id="s473">Well, I communicated with more Jewish people, more young people, and they were more educated than a lot of others, and they talked a lot about political stuff and about reading, music, and everything else, and we exchanged the books and everything!</span> <span id="s474">If I got some new book, an interesting book, I tried to give it to them to read and the same the other way around.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">(During this time was there any kind of religious service you could go to?</span> <span id="s476">Was there a synagogue in Kiev?)</span> <span id="s477">Yes, there was a large synagogue in Kiev but we didn't go to it.</span> <span id="s478">I don't know anybody who went to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s479">It wasn't closed but I think people were just afraid.</span> <span id="s480">My grandmother?</span> <span id="s481">no.</span> <span id="s482">Her sisters lived close to the synagogue, and - by the way, they were our source of matzoh!</span> <span id="s483">I know that some of my co-workers when we were in Moscow, they went to the Moscow synagogue, but no one I knew went to the Kiev synagogue.</span> <span id="s484">I think they were afraid to go.</span> <span id="s485">In Moscow, it was easy because nobody knew you.</span> <span id="s486">Somebody could hear you in the synagogue - it is not against the law to go but you can have trouble because someone could inform - not even KGB, but they can harass you.</span> <span id="s487">I know some people this happened to.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">(What happened to them?)</span> <span id="s489">I met them here in America, they are from Leningrad.</span> <span id="s490">They got troubles, they were thrown out of the Institute, out of college.</span> <span id="s491">(Because they were in a religious group?)</span> <span id="s492">Not a religious group - they just went to synagogue!</span> <span id="s493">When you are a student it is very easy to be expelled for any reason.</span> <span id="s494">They say, just behave and be a student, work hard, this is not good for the communist student.</span> <span id="s495">No more excuses.</span> <span id="s496">You can think anything but your behavior has to be what is good for a Soviet student!</span></p> <p><span id="s497">(Besides the books, when Gorbachev was elected your newspapers changed.</span> <span id="s498">Did anything surprise you?)</span> <span id="s499">No.</span> <span id="s500">At first.</span> <span id="s501">But we knew that they could write this in the newspaper.</span> <span id="s502">We knew what they wrote, that was not surprise to us.</span> <span id="s503">(You always had a network of information?)</span> <span id="s504">Yes.</span> <span id="s505">But it wasn't official.</span> <span id="s506">It all depends on the people with whom you communicate.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">(Can we talk a few minutes about Chernobyl?</span> <span id="s508">When did it happen?</span> <span id="s509">When was the explosion?)</span> <span id="s510">It was in April 26, 1986; Julia was four years old, yes.</span> <span id="s511">(Did you know what happened when it happened?</span> <span id="s512">Let's start with that.)</span> <span id="s513">It happened on Friday night, but we didn't know anything until Monday.</span> <span id="s514">When we got to work, some people knew about this and they told us.</span> <span id="s515">(But I didn't believe it.</span> <span id="s516">I felt that if it really happened, somebody should inform us.</span> <span id="s517">-Stan) There was nothing in the papers or on television.</span> <span id="s518">Then was the First of May, a work holiday and it was a little panic before the holiday.</span> <span id="s519">A lot of people whose work was related to nuclear physics, they understood how it was dangerous.</span> <span id="s520">For example, I couldn't understand because it was not my field.</span> <span id="s521">I could just get panicked like everyone else but not in the way a professional in this field could be.</span> <span id="s522">People who lived in the city were told to leave by acquaintances and to drink with a lot of milk with iodine.</span> <span id="s523">And so on.</span> <span id="s524">There was a little panic.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">(Did you leave the city?)</span> <span id="s526">Not before this holiday.</span> <span id="s527">Not before the whole government decided that to prevent this panic... You know that on the First of May we always have this big demonstration.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Some people thought that because of this big tragedy at Chernobyl they would cancel this demonstration because all people understood -- everybody said that we should close the door and close the window, not do anything outside.</span> <span id="s529">Because outside was very dangerous air - especially for children.</span> <span id="s530">And our government decided to hold this demonstration to show people that nothing happened and we had to go to a bicycle championship, right?</span> <span id="s531">They didn't cancel this bicycle competition.</span> <span id="s532">And I think nobody from the parents wanted their children to participate in this demonstration but school teachers they pushed children to participate in this demonstration.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">And it worked, by the way, it worked.</span> <span id="s534">Because people do believe what the government says.</span> <span id="s535">You know, if the government says we should do this, then maybe it is not so dangerous.</span> <span id="s536">It was terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">(When did they put it in the paper?)</span> <span id="s538">On the Fifth of May.</span> <span id="s539">We had four days of holiday, unfortunately.</span> <span id="s540">Usually we have two days holiday but it was the weekend, so it was a four day holiday.</span> <span id="s541">It was really good weather and people had picnics outside in the forest - it was really dangerous!</span> <span id="s542">And then, only on the fifth of May we came to work, and when we came to work my co-workers were really panicky on our job, because some friends of our co-workers were - their occupation was nuclear physics and they explained everything and they told that some people drove their children to other cities to stay with their grandparents or somebody else.</span> <span id="s543">I got really panicked.</span> <span id="s544">I just called (not to Stan he did not have a work phone), I just called to my mother and said I am going to the train station to buy some tickets.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">I didn't even say anything to my boss.</span> <span id="s546">I didn't even think of it.</span> <span id="s547">I didn't think about my job!</span> <span id="s548">Nobody was at work.</span> <span id="s549">I didn't know even where we should go!</span> <span id="s550">and to whom?</span> <span id="s551">Because I was still at work, and Stan was still at work, and my parents were still at work!</span> <span id="s552">So I thought when I was on my to the train station, where should we stay and with whom?</span> <span id="s553">And then at the station was a really huge line, really huge!</span> <span id="s554">Because I just went from work.</span> <span id="s555">So maybe I stayed five hours at the station to get the tickets, I forgot exactly how long, but it was really not a long line compared with other days.</span> <span id="s556">But after this day, there were no tickets at any place, nothing, and the lines were really long.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">On that day in the evening they began to talk to us on radio and on the television.</span> <span id="s558">Not to worry.</span> <span id="s559">We are working on this problem.</span> <span id="s560">We will take care of it.</span> <span id="s561">Just when I stayed in the line everybody talked about Chernobyl.</span> <span id="s562">But the only ones who got to leave the city were the children of officials, they left before the fifth of May!</span> <span id="s563">They sent their children away the 25th of April.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">(How did you know which direction to go in?)</span> <span id="s565">Just from people!</span> <span id="s566">When I stayed in the line waiting, everybody talked, everybody said what he or she knew.</span> <span id="s567">I told them what I knew, what my experience was.</span> <span id="s568">And we just had to analyze the information the best you could.</span> <span id="s569">But, we had only one place to go, to Stan's parents, to Lvov.</span> <span id="s570">It wasn't a good place to go, but it was better than Kiev.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">(Did all of you go?)</span> <span id="s572">No.</span> <span id="s573">My parents did not go, just I and my grandmother and Julia.</span> <span id="s574">I left my grandmother with Julia and went back to work.</span> <span id="s575">Kiev was like a dead city - no children at all!</span> <span id="s576">I never thought that it was such an awful feeling when you don't see any children.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">The second day after Chernobyl, some relatives in America called (not us) their relatives, our friends' relatives called them and asked, "Are you still alive?</span> <span id="s578">.</span> <span id="s579">Go away from Kiev!!"</span> <span id="s580">and they told us real information.</span> <span id="s581">Yes.</span> <span id="s582">This was the second day after Chernobyl, and they said don't drink the water, just use mineral water.</span> <span id="s583">Then my parents' friends sent us a big letter with a lot of instructions of what we should do.</span> <span id="s584">They knew that our government would not tell us what we should really do.</span> <span id="s585">So they sent us the instructions: don't drink water from the faucet; and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">(Eventually did you get the real information, or do you think you never really got the entire picture?)</span> <span id="s587">No.</span> <span id="s588">Never.</span> <span id="s589">(In every plant and every institute they had devices to measure the radiation, Geiger counters, and civil defense and the men who were responsible in the time of nuclear war.</span> <span id="s590">But they didn't give us any information about the radiation level.</span> <span id="s591">- Stan) Even in the children's Kindergarten they didn't give out complete information.</span> <span id="s592">They told us about some books we could research in the library.</span> <span id="s593">Of course, the people in Kiev were very angry, and the smarter, more intelligent people, were the angriest.</span> <span id="s594">I'm sure that a lot of people who don't know anything at all about nuclear radiation were not as concerned.</span> <span id="s595">You know, you cannot feel anything and if your government says it is all okay, don't panic, don't believe what other people tell you, (The people didn't see any changes - Stan) Yes, nuclear radiation you can't see, you can't touch it.</span> <span id="s596">But really educated people, of course, they knew about it.</span> <span id="s597">But what could we do?</span> <span id="s598">We could only go to the Library and take some book about Physics about Nuclear Energy, just read it and analyze the situation ourselves.</span> <span id="s599">(Also, unless you went to a relative, you couldn't just pick up and leave, you couldn't just go to another town to live, could you?)</span> <span id="s600">Of course, of course.</span> <span id="s601">It was really, and the government didn't permit the bosses, the presidents of the companies, to give the mothers a day off or some vacation.</span> <span id="s602">We can't take our vacation when we want to take them.</span> <span id="s603">We have a schedule from the first day of the year.</span> <span id="s604">And you can't call up and say that you are sick.</span> <span id="s605">You have to show a paper from your doctor that I am sick.</span> <span id="s606">So before that, I should go to the doctor, and the doctor will say "No, you are not sick."</span> <span id="s607">So, it was really - people were very angry.</span> <span id="s608">Especially since the government, to prevent panic, said don't permit the women to leave the city with children.</span> <span id="s609">And everybody knew that their children had already left Kiev.</span> <span id="s610">It was really terrible, you know, they were so angry, and in this moment I said, if we could leave the country, nobody would stay here.</span> <span id="s611">Not because they were afraid of the radiation but because people understood that nobody cared about them, and they were prevented from taking care of theirselves and their children.</span> <span id="s612">Even if they don't care about me, or my children, don't prevent me from caring for myself and my family!</span> <span id="s613">Right?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">(At this point, did you resolve to leave?</span> <span id="s615">I know that you wanted to leave for years but this was an added motivation?)</span> <span id="s616">Of course it was an added motivation.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">(When you used your papers to apply again to leave, how did it affect your life in Russia?)</span> <span id="s618">It was under Gorbachev's polical policy and now it is much better.</span> <span id="s619">I don't think it is better because people have changed but because the government changed.</span> <span id="s620">The government now says, it okay if they leave the country, guys.</span> <span id="s621">they leave the country but they are not our enemies.</span> <span id="s622">The attitude had changed a lot from fifteen years before.</span> <span id="s623">Not because people felt different but because the governement's official attitude was different on how to behave with people who wanted to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">(So did you have to go to a special agency with your invitations?)</span> <span id="s625">It is not an agency, it is like a department of the KGB who are responsible for giving permission to leave the country.</span> <span id="s626">(When did you go to them?)</span> <span id="s627">We tried first at the end of 1987 and we didn't have Julie on our old invitation because she hadn't been born then.</span> <span id="s628">So, they wouldn't accept this invitation and they said that we should get a new invitation.</span> <span id="s629">But we knew from other people that we could go to Moscow, to the Holland embassy, and they have the right to make the correction on our invitation.</span> <span id="s630">The government people didn't tell us this, but we knew from other people who had the experience.</span> <span id="s631">This is why I said we had information just from the communication of our friends and relatives and co-workers.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">(Was there any reason for that?</span> <span id="s633">How come Holland was allowed to make these changes?)</span> <span id="s634">Because there are no Israeli embassies in Russia because there are no real diplomatic relations.</span> <span id="s635">So Holland has an embassy in both places and Israel has allowed them to do this.</span> <span id="s636">So we went to Moscow and we corrected our invitations.</span> <span id="s637">Then we went back with the corrected papers and it was just before New Year and it was a really big holiday in Soviet Union.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Back at the KGB department, the woman there said, "You know guys, in just a half-hour I will finish my work, and you will not have time to fill out all your applications.</span> <span id="s639">Why don't you just come back after the New Year holiday?</span> <span id="s640">Your application is all right, everything looks fine, you should have not more trouble at all.</span> <span id="s641">Just come back in January, after the holiday."</span> <span id="s642">"Okay," we said, "we'll be back in January," and she congratulated us.</span> <span id="s643">.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">But when we went back in January, she said it is all finished.</span> <span id="s645">It is too late, it is a new policy.</span> <span id="s646">Of course, she knew this when we were in two days before the New Year.</span> <span id="s647">She knew it.</span> <span id="s648">And we said, you told us to come back after the holiday, why didn't you tell us then that there would be a problem in the future?</span> <span id="s649">She could not have cared less - it was not her problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">So, my father said - it is like a Russian expression - "We're left again!"</span> <span id="s651">.</span> <span id="s652">And then, accidently, again in February we heard from our network of information that it was working again.</span> <span id="s653">Just from my father's co-worker.</span> <span id="s654">So we went back to this department and again applied for leaving - and it worked!</span> <span id="s655">So we just took our papers and ran down there.</span> <span id="s656">(This was in April) Actually, we had to wait for six months, to get the permission and then maybe two or three months to get a visa.</span> <span id="s657">So it was nine months in all.</span> <span id="s658">At work, they had some formal meetings with us, we should say to them why we wanted to leave.</span> <span id="s659">What makes us unhappy in this country?</span> <span id="s660">and things like that.</span> <span id="s661">But it was just a formality, it wasn't like fifteen year ago when they said - you are animals, our enemies.</span> <span id="s662">Back then it was really hard.</span> <span id="s663">Some people who didn't leave said that it wasn't because they were afraid but it was really hard for older people.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">They set a meeting with the whole company.</span> <span id="s665">Can you imagine?</span> <span id="s666">You have to stand in front of the whole company and you have to say why you want to leave your country and everybody is staring at you.</span> <span id="s667">They had maybe five or ten people who should stand up and say their opinion about you.</span> <span id="s668">Especially like communist leaders, or professional union leader and some people who are interested in getting recognition, they should make a speech about you.</span> <span id="s669">It was really a terrible procedure, especially for old people and some people, I know, they had something like a heart attack.</span> <span id="s670">Not because they really cared what people thought about them but the feeling of standing alone before everyone, a lot of tension and stress.</span> <span id="s671">Why do you need to say to these people what you really think?</span></p> <p><span id="s672">But when we left, we just had to talk to our communist leader in our own company.</span> <span id="s673">(What did he say?)</span> <span id="s674">Why do you want to leave?</span> <span id="s675">I should know, he said - (I asked something like, why do I have to tell you this?</span> <span id="s676">-Stan) but he wasn't really offensive, he would be asked about this by his superior because, he said, I am responsible for you.</span> <span id="s677">I said that I had a lot of relatives in Israel and I want to live with them - I love them very much!</span> <span id="s678">I am sure that he realized that I lied, but he accepted this so he would have an answer when he was asked.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">(Do you still have relatives living in Kiev?)</span> <span id="s680">In Kiev?</span> <span id="s681">Yes.</span> <span id="s682">But not in Israel!</span> <span id="s683">I don't know anybody in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">(The reason I am asking is because when we write up your story, if there is any reason you feel you do not want your real name used, they can do that, you know.</span> <span id="s685">If there is a problem, if you think - - ) No, they have a different last name.</span> <span id="s686">We write letters and we call sometimes.</span> <span id="s687">They do want to leave.</span> <span id="s688">My father's youngest brother, he applied a few months ago, so maybe he will go to Israel.</span> <span id="s689">And my mother's cousin - she is like a sister, but you say here "cousin", (my grandmother and her mother were sisters.)</span> <span id="s690">they are going to Israel too.</span> <span id="s691">We have a lot, a lot of relatives but they are not very close.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">My cousin, my mother -- It is always confusing to me when you say cousin - how do you know if it is a sister, or a brother, a male or a female?</span> <span id="s693">You just say cousin but you don't know if it is a woman or a man!</span> <span id="s694">I find it confusing!</span> <span id="s695">My mother has two cousins, one is "he", one is "she".</span> <span id="s696">She is in Kiev but her other cousin, he just came to American two months ago.</span> <span id="s697">So we just had him here.</span> <span id="s698">It has been difficult, we told them all about our experiences.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">(So you finally then got your visas and your permits, how did you feel?)</span> <span id="s700">Good!!</span> <span id="s701">We really felt good.</span> <span id="s702">We were really busy.</span> <span id="s703">It was a hard time for us, with the apartment, with packing, with tickets.</span> <span id="s704">(Were you limited in how much you carry out?)</span> <span id="s705">Yes, of course.</span> <span id="s706">Very limited.</span> <span id="s707">And after us, it was really restricted even more.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">(What was the problem with the apartment?)</span> <span id="s709">With the apartment it was only a money problem.</span> <span id="s710">We should have a paper from some agency, not from like a janitor here, but a state agency.</span> <span id="s711">We should get a list signed by some agency that is responsible for our apartment because it is really not our apartment, it is a government apartment.</span> <span id="s712">So we should give our apartment back to the government.</span> <span id="s713">So, they should sign a paper that this apartment is in good condition.</span> <span id="s714">No damage, no this or that.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">It is a problem, because they do come and inspect, and depending on their mood, we could spend one thousand rubles in repairs, or five hundred dollars or two thousand, so it depends on their mood.</span> <span id="s716">(Is this a bribe?)</span> <span id="s717">Of course, of course.</span> <span id="s718">It is better to give them one hundred rubles than one thousand to the government, because we know that our apartment was so beautiful.</span> <span id="s719">We had done a lot of repairs the year before.</span> <span id="s720">And the man who got this apartment after us was really happy - he said, maybe ten times - thank you for us for keeping this apartment in such good shape.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">After Julia came, we lived with our parents for about two years and then my father got a new apartment.</span> <span id="s722">So we had the two room apartment from my father and the one room apartment from my grandmother and we changed it for a three room apartment.</span> <span id="s723">It is popular way to do things in Russia.</span> <span id="s724">So my grandmother had a separate room, and we had two rooms.</span> <span id="s725">We decided to do that because Julia was so ill and she wasn't a healthy child; she got sick and got sick.</span> <span id="s726">Very often when I went to work I had to ask my grandmother to go to our apartment to stay with her.</span> <span id="s727">It wasn't convenient for her, you know, to be without clothes for one week, for example.</span> <span id="s728">She packed and she packed.</span> <span id="s729">So, actually she lived with us in our two-room apartment that is why we decided to change the two apartments for the bigger one.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">(So, what happened to your grandmother?</span> <span id="s731">Did she come with you?)</span> <span id="s732">No.</span> <span id="s733">She died.</span> <span id="s734">One year before we applied.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">(Now, you are packing your belongings, so I'd like to know what your feelings were then?)</span> <span id="s736">(We were trying to pack as quickly as possible - Stan) We thought that an any time something could happen and possibly we could not leave.</span> <span id="s737">You know, we call Russia the Country of Miracles.</span> <span id="s738">Because, every day you can have something happen and we can't believe one hundred percent for sure that we have something.</span> <span id="s739">We know that today we can go to bed and tomorrow we watch TV and everything changes!</span> <span id="s740">And then you can throw away your paper, your visa, your tickets and anything else!</span> <span id="s741">(So we tried to get our tickets, it was a big problem - Stan) Yes, we had a big problem with tickets!</span></p> <p><span id="s742">We couldn't get tickets!</span> <span id="s743">(You don't know this problem!</span> <span id="s744">-Stan) (You mean airline tickets) Yes.</span> <span id="s745">From Moscow to Vienna.</span> <span id="s746">You could not get them.</span> <span id="s747">Again, you know, we should have to bribe somebody.</span> <span id="s748">That is how we got them.</span> <span id="s749">We started to work with this problem before we got the Visa.</span> <span id="s750">But for some people it takes like half a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">It was funny, because when we flew from Moscow to Vienna, we had a lot of free places on the airplane.</span> <span id="s752">Always.</span> <span id="s753">Not only on our airplane, but everyone says that.</span> <span id="s754">They say "no tickets", No.</span> <span id="s755">Everything is No.</span> <span id="s756">And then they have a lot of empty seats.</span> <span id="s757">So there was the two of us and Julia and my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">(How did you feel when you left?)</span> <span id="s759">I felt bad, bad.</span> <span id="s760">Because it is hard to leave, because our relatives were in the airport to say goodbye.</span> <span id="s761">They went with us from Kiev to Moscow.</span> <span id="s762">So we had a bad feeling, only because of our relatives, not because we loved the country so much.</span> <span id="s763">It was hard to say good-bye.</span> <span id="s764">I can't say that I hate Russia, or that I hate Russians, No.</span> <span id="s765">We love the country, we just don't like the system.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">We had a really bad experience before we left with Customs, checking our baggage.</span> <span id="s767">It was really awful, really awful.</span> <span id="s768">Julia was sick and she had a temperature, a fever, and they didn't permit us to have any medicine.</span> <span id="s769">And I could say nothing to them because I didn't have any papers that said they couldn't do that to me, you know?</span> <span id="s770">I couldn't prove anything!</span></p> <p><span id="s771">(In Vienna, we didn't know any German, and we should go to drugstore and ask for drugs.</span> <span id="s772">And we didn't know what to say, what to ask for.</span> <span id="s773">I had a German vocabulary with me but I showed it to the pharmacist and that did some good.</span> <span id="s774">-Stan) We didn't know how to say it was for a child, or anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">(In Vienna, were you on your own, or were you met by someone from one of the agencies?)</span> <span id="s776">We were met by HIAS.</span> <span id="s777">They met us and gave us an apartment and that was it.</span> <span id="s778">We lived there for twelve days.</span> <span id="s779">(And that's where you changed your mind, to come to America and not go to Israel?)</span> <span id="s780">Oh no, we always knew we meant to come here.</span> <span id="s781">(We had all the trouble with our customs in Moscow; and then when we got to Vienna, their customs officer told us "Welcome."</span> <span id="s782">-Stan) When I left Russia, I had a really bad feeling about the country we were leaving, because what kind of a country is it when they would not let me take any medications for my child.</span> <span id="s783">And when I say that maybe - to the man that wouldn't permit it - I said, maybe if this were your child, maybe you would behave in a different way.</span> <span id="s784">And he said to me, "My child doesn't go to Israel!"</span> <span id="s785">I said, "Unfortunately for you, and for him."</span> <span id="s786">I was really angry, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">(Well, we now have you out of Russia and Vienna, and getting ready to come here.</span> <span id="s788">So that is probably where we should begin.</span> <span id="s789">I want you to know that it is very natural that you would feel badly leaving your family, and I want you to know that it is totally understandable that you lived all your life as a Russian and, probably, in the back of your head, culturally, with what you like to read and music you like, you will probably always be Russian.</span> <span id="s790">That is natural, so don't feel that you have to love everything here.)</span> <span id="s791">(So, you were in Vienna for two or three weeks, something like that --) It was a wonderful time, wonderful time!</span> <span id="s792">It is a won- derful city, a very old city, beautiful architecture, opera.</span> <span id="s793">We know how Russians buy the tickets in the top of the theater?</span> <span id="s794">Not too nice of seats, but it was good.</span> <span id="s795">It was beautiful, the Vienna Opera is famous.</span> <span id="s796">By the way, the town where Stanley lived before Kiev, in Lvov, they have a ancient theater and the Lvov Opera is highly ranked.</span> <span id="s797">There is the LaScala at Milan, then the Vienna Opera, then the Opera at Lvov!</span></p> <p><span id="s798">It was a wonderful time, especially because Vienna is just a wonderful city.</span> <span id="s799">You know, Austria is a wonderful country.</span> <span id="s800">But especially comparing with the Soviet Union, you know?</span> <span id="s801">Like yesterday we were in the Soviet Union; today we are - !</span> <span id="s802">wonderful.</span> <span id="s803">It was great just looking in the store windows.</span> <span id="s804">Julia was in shock!</span> <span id="s805">She was six years old.</span> <span id="s806">We were prepared for this because we had read a lot of letters from people who left before us.</span> <span id="s807">So we had read about their feelings so we were ready but I couldn't say that we were in shock, but for Julia!</span> <span id="s808">!</span> <span id="s809">- you know.</span> <span id="s810">We told her not to ask us to buy anything, because we didn't have any money, so please just don't ask.</span> <span id="s811">We told her that after we got to America and had a job, then we would buy things for her.</span> <span id="s812">But before America, please do not ask us!</span> <span id="s813">So, she just stood near the store windows with an open mouth and big eyes.</span> <span id="s814">It was wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">After twelve days, we went to Rome.</span> <span id="s816">That is the usual procedure.</span> <span id="s817">We stayed in Italy for two months.</span> <span id="s818">Waiting for the American visa.</span> <span id="s819">We had the Soviet Visa to come to this country, but not the American visa letting us enter.</span> <span id="s820">(Are you still under HIAS protection in Rome?)</span> <span id="s821">Yes, but not like in Vienna.</span> <span id="s822">They didn't give us an apartment.</span> <span id="s823">They gave us money to rent an apartment but we had to go look for the apartment ourselves.</span> <span id="s824">So, it was a bit of a problem, it wasn't as nice as Vienna!</span> <span id="s825">(You know, this is something we never had to do in Russia, so we had no experience in how to rent an apartment.</span> <span id="s826">And we didn't know Italian at all!</span> <span id="s827">- Stan) We just found out how to say a few words in Italian "Do you have an apartment for rent?"</span> <span id="s828">.</span> <span id="s829">Something like that!</span> <span id="s830">It was the first experience in a capitalist country for us!</span></p> <p><span id="s831">The weather was warm, it was beautiful.</span> <span id="s832">It was not a very good feeling about living there, but we were just worried about our future.</span> <span id="s833">(How did you like the different foods that you ran into on your travels?)</span> <span id="s834">Well, we didn't have any extra money so we really tried to budget.</span> <span id="s835">It isn't like here where you just go to a restaurant and try different things, we were really short of money.</span> <span id="s836">We didn't even try pizza in Italy, only here!</span> <span id="s837">Of course, we didn't have a lot of money.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">(So then you finally got the Visa from the American government to come.</span> <span id="s839">Did you fly from Rome?)</span> <span id="s840">Yes.</span> <span id="s841">All five of us.</span> <span id="s842">We flew from Rome to New York and then New York to Chicago.</span> <span id="s843">(Did you stay in New York at all?)</span> <span id="s844">We should have done this on the same day but there was a delay.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">(Why did you pick Chicago?)</span> <span id="s846">Why?</span> <span id="s847">Because my parent's friends lived in Chicago and they were our sponsors.</span> <span id="s848">We couldn't go to any city, except New York, unless we had a sponsor in that city.</span> <span id="s849">(You could have gone to New York?)</span> <span id="s850">Yes, New York is like a free port of entry, you do not need a sponsor there.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">(Did your sponsors meet you at the airport?)</span> <span id="s852">Yes.</span> <span id="s853">They had been my father's classmates in Russia.</span> <span id="s854">They had been here for about ten years from 1977 or 1978, they just left Russia before we decided to leave.</span> <span id="s855">Before 1979.</span> <span id="s856">Stan did not know them because it was before our marriage.</span> <span id="s857">(Did they find a place for you here?)</span> <span id="s858">Yes, they found a place for us for a few weeks and then we just rented an apartment in an area where we wanted to stay.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">(Did you get jobs right away?)</span> <span id="s860">No!</span> <span id="s861">It took a half of a year to get the jobs.</span> <span id="s862">We had the Jewish community support for three months, right?</span> <span id="s863">Then we asked them for a loan because we still didn't have a job.</span> <span id="s864">And maybe in five months, I got a job and then a month later Stan got a job.</span> <span id="s865">I worked in a small company, (I didn't like this job) in two months I changed to a good company!</span> <span id="s866">Now I am really happy!</span> <span id="s867">I work for Information Resources, Incorporated.</span> <span id="s868">It is located downtown in Chicago.</span> <span id="s869">It is a marketing association, it is very interesting, I really like it.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">(What do you like about America and Chicago?</span> <span id="s871">And then I am going to ask what you do not like about it.)</span> <span id="s872">First we liked the people.</span> <span id="s873">People ask us what was the first thing that surprised us about Chicago.</span> <span id="s874">And it was the people, smiling!</span> <span id="s875">(Russian propaganda told us that Americans are all --- Stan) We didn't believe in all the Russian propaganda!</span> <span id="s876">But, you know, but somedays we had - we really believed that people were enemies to each other.</span> <span id="s877">This is the Soviet propaganda.</span> <span id="s878">You thought??</span> <span id="s879">Come on!</span> <span id="s880">But it is really surprising, you know, you walk on the street and people just smile.</span> <span id="s881">They don't know you, but they smile.</span> <span id="s882">And sometimes they say "Hello".</span> <span id="s883">And people are not angry because they don't have to stand in the line for food, because they should do something that they don't want to.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">It's not only that they don't like to stand in line.</span> <span id="s885">People in Russia are really angry, because of the hard life.</span> <span id="s886">But, I love people, Americans.</span> <span id="s887">I know that sometimes someone may smile at me and maybe he or she doesn't like me, but I don't really care!</span></p> <p><span id="s888">It is just very comfortable here, we feel free, and we have choices, you know.</span> <span id="s889">What we want to do, we can do.</span> <span id="s890">And we know that everything depends on us.</span> <span id="s891">That is a really good feeling, you know.</span> <span id="s892">We have more control over our future, we have more motivation.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">We were young when we were in Russia, right?</span> <span id="s894">but we didn't have any future.</span> <span id="s895">We didn't feel any motivation to live, to grow, to have some drive to do more.</span> <span id="s896">We always knew that we had some limits, not only because we were Jewish, some limits were because we were Jews, but there was much more than that.</span> <span id="s897">Everybody felt the limitations.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">If you don't have somebody who can help you, somebody in government or somebody like that, maybe somebody you can bribe, there is no way!</span> <span id="s899">Even if you are more smart than anybody else, the stupid people will not like you and you will never get a raise because you are more smart than your boss, for example.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">(At work, even though they do not make it harder now for you to leave, did you find that the people who were not Jewish were jealous?)</span> <span id="s901">Some of them, yes.</span> <span id="s902">But you know, the situation in Russia, now is that everybody wants to leave.</span> <span id="s903">It depends, if the person is a good person, he or she can just say "Good luck for you.</span> <span id="s904">If I were a Jew, I would leave, I would do the same."</span> <span id="s905">But some, you know, they were not good to you and they can be really jealous, and they won't talk with you anymore.</span> <span id="s906">(The reason I was asking was that I heard that there was a lot of Anti-semitism because of this.)</span> <span id="s907">Yes, and they said, "Why is it only the Jews who can leave?"</span> <span id="s908">It is not only one person but many.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">(What is it you don't like here?)</span> <span id="s910">(Too many commercials!</span> <span id="s911">- Stan) Right, the commercials.</span> <span id="s912">(You don't have a lot of advertising, do you?)</span> <span id="s913">Especially on TV, maybe there is just not anything to sell.</span> <span id="s914">It is really a difficult question to answer.</span> <span id="s915">I don't like that I can't speak English, good.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">(Can we talk for just a minute, about your dreams and your hopes?</span> <span id="s917">You are here now and you're going to stay here.</span> <span id="s918">It takes a while to really feel at home in a new place.</span> <span id="s919">Please talk about what you hope your future will be here for you.)</span> <span id="s920">We are the same people like Americans, so we have the same dreams.</span> <span id="s921">What is the main American dream?</span> <span id="s922">To have a house, to have a good car, what is the third?</span> <span id="s923">There are three things but I can't remember the third.</span> <span id="s924">So those are our dreams too.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Our first dream, of course, is Julia.</span> <span id="s926">She was our first reason to leave Russia.</span> <span id="s927">We want to see her well educated and to get a good education and to see her happy.</span> <span id="s928">We don't forget about ourselves, we want to have a house, and we want to have a good bank account, and to have money to travel a lot.</span> <span id="s929">We would like to see Europe.</span> <span id="s930">(To go back to Vienna with some money in your pockets?)</span> <span id="s931">Vienna, yes, and other countries and cities.</span> <span id="s932">We haven't seen so many places that we need to go back again to the few we have seen!</span></p> <p><span id="s933">We have decided, ourselves, that we would like to make our first trip to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">(Is there something I haven't asked you that you think I should have?</span> <span id="s935">Is there something you want to say?)</span> <span id="s936">No, I think we covered very much.</span> <span id="s937">I just want to say thank you for all American Jews.</span> <span id="s938">We know that we are here because of you and we understand that we should do the same for others.</span> <span id="s939">That is why the Jews are still alive, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s940">(We are just lucky because our grandparents left earlier, or the got on a boat earlier, and that is why we can help now) I can tell an interesting story about my family.</span> <span id="s941">About the things you talk about.</span> <span id="s942">(Please.)</span> <span id="s943">My father's grandfather, before the Revolution, came to American - in something like 1917 -it was between the Revolution and 1920.</span> <span id="s944">He came with his family but not his wife and children, with his two brothers.</span> <span id="s945">The brother's family stayed here and my grandfather decided to go back.</span> <span id="s946">He just came to find out what America was.</span> <span id="s947">Then he decided to go back and get his family and bring them to America.</span> <span id="s948">But when he went back, he came by boat and there was a crash.</span> <span id="s949">It was a very famous event.</span> <span id="s950">It was not a boat, it was a ship, and only five people from this ship survived.</span> <span id="s951">And my great-grandfather survived.</span> <span id="s952">And it was on his papers that he wanted to go to America.</span> <span id="s953">But then he got back home to Russia, and he didn't want to go again!</span> <span id="s954">Not by ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">That is why we were not here!</span> <span id="s956">I always said that I should have been born in America!</span> <span id="s957">And I didn't know how to find my relatives, I knew only their last names.</span> <span id="s958">They would be very old people, but I think they are dead now.</span> <span id="s959">We don't know if they stayed in New York; and, of course, we don't know the names of their children.</span> <span id="s960">Just - it was a very common name.</span> <span id="s961">It would be difficult but I think it would be really interesting to find out if any of them are around.</span> <span id="s962">My father knows the year they were here.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">(There is a list in the Library of Congress, in Washington, of everybody who came, day by day.)</span> <span id="s964">Even if it was in 1919, 1920?</span></p> <p><span id="s965">(Yes, and in Utah, the Mormon Church, it is a Christian Church, and they kept excellent records.</span> <span id="s966">It can be done but it is not easy.</span> <span id="s967">It would take a lot of time and energy.)</span> <span id="s968">(The same with my brother too.</span> <span id="s969">He did that.-Stan) (Were you ever drafted, Stan, like Afghanistan?</span> <span id="s970">Or how do they draft into the Army?)</span> <span id="s971">I was drafted at the time of the Institute.</span> <span id="s972">I had a military course.</span> <span id="s973">In college, yes.</span> <span id="s974">I had military officer's position.</span> <span id="s975">In this case, I wasn't drafted but every two years I should go to military camp and have some training.</span> <span id="s976">Just like your reserve years.</span> <span id="s977">This training was to last until I was thirty-six and forty, nobody is sure yet.</span> <span id="s978">(He participated in this camp training maybe three or four times during our marriage.</span> <span id="s979">- Elen) (If you were still in Russia, you would still be going?)</span> <span id="s980">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">(The other question is a little more difficult.</span> <span id="s982">I was thinking about the fact that your mother and you were the only child in your families.</span> <span id="s983">I know, and by the way, I understand, I feel that a woman should have the amount of children she wants, and that is it.</span> <span id="s984">And I know that in Russia, abortion is a very accepted thing.</span> <span id="s985">Now, did your mother really just had one child or do you think that she used abortion - as I know many Russian and American people do.-H) I don't think I know exactly that she had an abortion.</span> <span id="s986">I know that she really only wanted one child.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">(One more question, Elen, what is your birthdate?</span> <span id="s988">There is nothing in the forms I have.)</span> <span id="s989">April 28, 1959.</span> <span id="s990">(Thank you.)</span></p></body></html>
