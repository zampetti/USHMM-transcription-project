id="s9">INTERVIEWER: Elaine Snyderman (You were born and grew up in Kishinev?</span> <span id="s10">What was your education like?</span> <span id="s11">What do you remember about the very start?</span> <span id="s12">Was someone teaching you at home or did you start in a Nursery School?)</span> <span id="s13">My mother spent a lot of time with me and she gave me everything that I know.</span> <span id="s14">I think everything I know is my mother because she gave me much.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">I was seven years old when I started school.</span> <span id="s16">I went to musical school, a special school for music.</span> <span id="s17">I studied the piano.</span> <span id="s18">I have a piano in Russia, but not here.</span> <span id="s19">It is not possible to have it here.</span> <span id="s20">I studied piano for seven years.</span> <span id="s21">In Russia, I had two schools, music school and public school.</span> <span id="s22">It is required to go to public school and I graduated from my school in 1979.</span> <span id="s23">After that I entered a Mechanical Institute in Kishinev.</span> <span id="s24">I graduated from that Institute in 1986.</span> <span id="s25">It took six years because after I graduated from school, I tried to leave Russia, and the Russian government would not give me the permission, that was in 1980.</span> <span id="s26">So I did not get accepted here until 1981.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">(What do you remember about growing up in Kishinev as a Jewish girl?)</span> <span id="s28">When I was a child I had no problems because I stayed home with my mother.</span> <span id="s29">After when I became a school girl I remember I had problems from Fifth Grade.</span> <span id="s30">I was about ten years old.</span> <span id="s31">In Russia, they used middle names and my father's name was Izrail.</span> <span id="s32">It was the time of a war in Israel, and the Russians they hated Israel and when Russian school girls and boys heard the name Izrail, they laughed and it was very I felt very uncomfortable.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">The teachers laughed also.</span> <span id="s34">She laughed and she tried to get everybody to speak my middle name, because it embarrassed me.</span> <span id="s35">There were only two or three other Jewish children in the class.</span> <span id="s36">They were teased this way too, so we stuck together.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">(When you tried to go to the Mechanical Institute in Kishinev did you find that there was a limit on the number of Jews there?)</span> <span id="s38">Yes, sure.</span> <span id="s39">And only this Institute would take Jews as students because in Kishinev the also had a University and seven institutes and this was the only one that would accept us.</span> <span id="s40">There were about eight thousand students in the Institute.</span> <span id="s41">I don't know exactly how many students were Jews, but I think about five hundred.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">(Did you feel that you were treated fairly there, as a student?</span> <span id="s43">Did you feel that your work was judged just like everybody else's?)</span> <span id="s44">Oh, in Russia, everybody from the Jewish people, they know that they can't do the same as other people.</span> <span id="s45">They gave different tests, they gave much harder homework, more problems, and harder problems to solve.</span> <span id="s46">But it was not all bad, I think, because we can do this work.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">(You graduated in 1986, and then what did you do next?)</span> <span id="s48">Then I went to work.</span> <span id="s49">I took a job.</span> <span id="s50">I worked in a mechanical plant, I worked like a drafting designer.</span> <span id="s51">This is what I would like to do here, too.</span> <span id="s52">I have some problems with computers, of course, in Russia, they never used computers, then.</span> <span id="s53">Right now?</span> <span id="s54">I don't know.</span> <span id="s55">That is my problem.</span> <span id="s56">I would like to take a class in this in June.</span> <span id="s57">I think I will go the Moraine Valley Community College to study this.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">(In your home, in your childhood, did you get to see your grandparents?</span> <span id="s59">Did you get a sense of the Jewish holidays?</span> <span id="s60">Were there any Jewish celebrations at home?)</span> <span id="s61">My mother celebrated every Jewish holiday.</span> <span id="s62">She did everything so well.</span> <span id="s63">We celebrated, what is going on right now, 'Shavuot' and Purim and it was in February.</span> <span id="s64">I have never seen a synagogue, my mother did all the things at home.</span> <span id="s65">For Rosh Hashonah and Yom Kippur it was most important day.</span> <span id="s66">We stayed at home and didn't eat.</span> <span id="s67">It was hard, we had to stay home from work or school.</span> <span id="s68">When we fasted, we stayed home.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">(Where did you meet Alex, your husband?)</span> <span id="s70">I met Alex in Kishinev.</span> <span id="s71">He came there after his degree to work in Kishinev.</span> <span id="s72">He came to the Engineering Institute.</span> <span id="s73">His family is from Leningrad.</span> <span id="s74">His friends worked in Kishinev and his friend is my friend's brother.</span> <span id="s75">They introduced us.</span> <span id="s76">We were married in 1986.</span> <span id="s77">The same year I graduated.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">(Had you both studied English, before you came here?)</span> <span id="s79">Yes.</span> <span id="s80">But we both speak it very bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">(What was your home like in Kishinev?</span> <span id="s82">Your father had a really nice job before 1980.</span> <span id="s83">So, did you remain in the same house after 1980, or did you have to move?)</span> <span id="s84">No!</span> <span id="s85">We had a very bad apartment, all the time.</span> <span id="s86">It was only one room.</span> <span id="s87">The kitchen was without windows, it had a small light, like a closet.</span> <span id="s88">The bathroom was very bad, we had no bath, only a shower.</span> <span id="s89">My father, my mother and myself, we all lived in the same room.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">After Alex and I got married, we had a smaller room for the two of us.</span> <span id="s91">Bela was born in 1987, and we were in this small apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">When our daughter, Bela, was nine months old, we took our papers to go to Ovir (pronounced Aveer), in Russia.</span> <span id="s93">It is an organization where Jewish people took their papers and tried to ask the government through this organization for permission to leave.</span> <span id="s94">In 1988 we received the permission to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">(What did you do with the piano?)</span> <span id="s96">I sold the piano.</span> <span id="s97">We sold everything we had, or else gave it to other people.</span> <span id="s98">We took an airplane from Moscow to Vienna.</span> <span id="s99">We stayed in Vienna about two weeks, it was very nice.</span> <span id="s100">But my mother was very sick already.</span> <span id="s101">After that we went to Rome, in Italy.</span> <span id="s102">We were there about one month.</span> <span id="s103">From Rome we came here.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Our sponsor in America was Michael Schwartz.</span> <span id="s105">(Did they help you get the work?)</span> <span id="s106">No.</span> <span id="s107">I stayed with Bela during the day and some evenings I work at MacDonald's.</span> <span id="s108">It is close.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">(What does Alex do?)</span> <span id="s110">He works as a machinist, he is an operator of a CNC machine.</span> <span id="s111">He works at HAR Aerospace.</span> <span id="s112">I think they work for the military with some sort of an aircraft plant.</span> <span id="s113">He is happy with his work.</span> <span id="s114">He would like to be doing the same work as he did in Russia.</span> <span id="s115">There he was a manufacturing engineer.</span> <span id="s116">It is work with tool and die and parts of machinery.</span> <span id="s117">There was more planning and design there.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">(If you get the computer training, then you would be designing also.</span> <span id="s119">What kind of a company would you like to work for?)</span> <span id="s120">I don't know right now.</span> <span id="s121">Right now, I don't know much about what company I can help.</span> <span id="s122">I need the details.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">(Do you think there is some kind of Jewish agency that could help you find the right kind of company?)</span> <span id="s124">Yes.</span> <span id="s125">They tried but right now they can't.</span> <span id="s126">(Do they say that they might be more helpful after you finish the computer training?)</span> <span id="s127">Maybe.</span> <span id="s128">But I tried by myself to get a job.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">(What would you like to have for your life here?</span> <span id="s130">What would you like for Bela's life to be?)</span> <span id="s131">I would like to have my daughter in the field of Jewish communications.</span> <span id="s132">I think that maybe she can be more able to communicate with Jewish people, in Jewish schools.</span> <span id="s133">We would probably move from this area.</span> <span id="s134">(When do you think you might move?)</span> <span id="s135">I don't know.</span> <span id="s136">We might like to move to Skokie.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">(What kind of help are you getting now from Jewish organizations?)</span> <span id="s138">We have had much help from Jewish organizations.</span> <span id="s139">Right now, they are trying to find jobs for us, for me and for Alex. Bela does not go to Nursery School yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">[Interrupted by Bela.]</span> <span id="s141">(Greta, what are some of the things you miss about Russia?)</span> <span id="s142">I miss my friends very much.</span></p></body></html>
