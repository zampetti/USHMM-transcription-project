Okay.</span> <span id="s9">The first question is an easy one, what is your full name?</span></p> <p><span id="s10">Answer: My full name is Dustin Isaac Dezube.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: And when were your born, and where?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: I was born at Brigham Women’s Hospital in 1983, March 11th.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: Were you named after somebody in particular, and if so, what do you know about that person?</span> <span id="s14">Tell me a little bit about --</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: The D in Dustin comes from my great-grandfather David on my grandmother’s side -- on my mom’s, of course.</span> <span id="s16">And they didn’t want to name me David, but they took the D and went with a name that started with a D. My middle name, Isaac, I believe comes also -- comes after my grandfather’s father.</span> <span id="s17">My last name is artificial, it was made up upon coming to America.</span> <span id="s18">And that’s my name.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: Do you -- do you relate to the people you were name -- named after in some way?</span> <span id="s20">Does it have special meaning for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: I’ve seen pictures of them, but the fact that my name, it’s not a very strong connection.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: You do have a Hebrew name, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: I do, Davide, and that also -- that was translated.</span> <span id="s24">There was no connection.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: Okay, give me a little sen -- give me a sense of how you see your grandparents.</span> <span id="s26">What -- what -- wh-when you would -- okay, try to describe your grandfather a little bit.</span> <span id="s27">How do you see him, or how you saw him, if that -- maybe that has changed, even.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: When you sort of look back at who you as a -- as a smaller boy, how did you relate to both of them?</span> <span id="s30">Give me a picture of who she is, or was, and how you saw him.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: This is, of course, on my mother’s side, and they are both great people, but quite different.</span> <span id="s32">My grandfather, he’s a storyteller, he’s tenacious, in a good way.</span> <span id="s33">He’s funny, he’s loving.</span> <span id="s34">He’s done so much with his life.</span> <span id="s35">I’m really proud of him, and there’s a lot of aspects of him which I’d like to emulate in myself when I grow older.</span> <span id="s36">Not all, but a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: Like what?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: I admire his determination.</span> <span id="s39">His ability to stick to principles.</span> <span id="s40">I admire how he made himself up from an immigrant to what he is now.</span> <span id="s41">I admire his courage and strength that he exhibited during the war.</span> <span id="s42">And my grandmother, she’s very loving, she’s very emotional, whereas my grandfather is not as emotional.</span> <span id="s43">The one thing I do remember him getting very upset about was I dated, briefly, a girl that wasn’t Jewish and that deeply upset him.</span> <span id="s44">But that’s over.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: Did you understand why that upset him?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: I did, I -- I -- I certainly understood where he was coming from.</span> <span id="s47">At the time I was young and I had no -- no intentions of having a serious lo -- relationship with a non-Jewish girl.</span> <span id="s48">That was never -- it didn’t cross my mind.</span> <span id="s49">I -- I do -- I do factor that in when I look at girls.</span> <span id="s50">But my grandmother, getting back to her, she’s -- well actually, I actually call him Sabba, which is grandfather in Hebrew, and I call her Savta.</span> <span id="s51">So ca -- is that -- can I --</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: Yeah, whatever</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: Alright, alright.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: -- you just keep on going until you --</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: And Savta’s very loving, she’s very emotional, she cares a lot about everyone in the family.</span> <span id="s56">We’re especially close because I’m the eldest.</span> <span id="s57">And I’m also proud of her, she survived, she has a ton of interesting stories, too.</span> <span id="s58">She speaks seven different languages, she’s -- and just the other day I found out she knows calculus and she’s a very intelligent woman.</span> <span id="s59">And she’s in good shape, she walks every day.</span> <span id="s60">And I’m very proud of each of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: How do you know much about who they were as -- ab-about their history, did you read their books, did they talk -- di-did they tell you?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: I’ve heard stories ever since I was old enough to understand what they meant, about the war.</span> <span id="s63">I also read Against All Odds.</span> <span id="s64">Of course, I’ve -- I’ve known most of the stories that were going to be in the book before I read the book.</span> <span id="s65">My grandfather’s full of stories, he just tells and I treasure them because he’s a great storyteller.</span> <span id="s66">He composed a book of vignettes, and over two years ago I read that, it’s coming out soon.</span> <span id="s67">And I’ve heard a lot orally, and I’ve read a lot.</span> <span id="s68">The one thing I -- I’ve heard a lot about his boyhood, his childhood in Poland.</span> <span id="s69">I -- I ha -- I haven’t really -- I started reading the book, A Jewish Boyhood in Poland, but I didn’t finish that.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: Do you think you might go actually to Poland someday to sort of see where that history started, or it hasn’t occurred to you yet?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: It occurred to me to go to Poland and the surrounding area, but it would have been part of more of an organization or a program like the March of the Living, rather than to explore his childhood.</span> <span id="s72">But I think it would be interesting to see where he grew up, but I don’t know what remnants there are.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: Do you remember -- not the book so much, but do you remember parts of stories that they told you when you were a youngster, when you go back -- not now, but -- but then, when you were maybe, I don’t know, five or six or something?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: Is there anything that is particularly strong in your mind?</span> <span id="s76">If you could repeat that or talk about it a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: Well, I always picture my grandfather as a heroic -- I see him mostly as a partisan fighter.</span> <span id="s78">He was the partisan fighter for a period of time and then he joined the Russian army, but that’s the image I picture him, and he’s told me heroic war stories and the like, and that’s what comes to mind when I think of him.</span> <span id="s79">And my grandmother, she’s told me stories too, and she was beautiful, and I just picture her as the charmer she was, as she went as a -- she masqueraded as a Pole.</span> <span id="s80">And that’s the picture I get of her.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: Were there some stories that affected you in a different way?</span> <span id="s82">That were very difficult for you to -- to hear, for some reason?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: A lot of the stories I was told, they inspired me and they made me proud of my grandfather.</span> <span id="s84">One was where he was -- he was shot five times by his friends who turned on him, and he’s obviously still alive today.</span> <span id="s85">And he has the bullet wounds to show, and -- but he -- I never heard so much of the atrocities that happened during the war, only much later, now.</span> <span id="s86">And I learned a lot more about them through my own reading, because I’m also very interested in the Holocaust, I’ve read more than several books over -- on the issue, I’ve seen movies, and through them I’ve gotten a more complete picture.</span> <span id="s87">I’ve visited, of course, the Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C., and Israel, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: Was that on your -- on your own initiative, or did you also learn about it in school?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: I actually -- I -- I went to a parochial school, and surprisingly they didn't teach very much about the Holocaust, I’m assuming because they took it for granted that people understood what it was.</span> <span id="s90">We only briefly touched upon it in eighth grade.</span> <span id="s91">We didn’t have a very general history course.</span> <span id="s92">But I’m aware that a lot of my friends that have gone up through the system in the public schools, they -- they know -- they know about what the Holocaust is.</span> <span id="s93">They’ve learned about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: Did you talk to your -- d-do you have a feeling that you knew more about -- in a sense because you knew your grandparents, or because -- or did already learn what you were taught in school, kind of?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s96">I -- I feel that I know a lot, a lot more about the Holocaust, and about all -- not all the aspects, but a lot more of the aspects than my friends, or than I was taught in school.</span> <span id="s97">And even in the books that I’ve read, because I have my grandfather to talk to, and whenever I had a question or -- I talked to him and I got firsthand feedback.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: Did he ever -- did they ever, either your grandmother or your grandfather, come to school to talk about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: Well -- to my school?</span> <span id="s100">Not when I was there.</span> <span id="s101">They -- my grandfather, he is a speaker, he goes around and he constantly speaks at high schools, and junior high, colleges.</span> <span id="s102">He came to my brother’s school, which was my old day school, but I was -- this was last year, so I must have been -- was either -- I was either a sophomore or junior.</span> <span id="s103">And he spoke briefly, and they put up a plaque.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: Do you talk to some of your friends, or did you talk with -- to some of your friends about your grandparents and about your own thoughts on the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: I don’t talk about my own thoughts on the Holocaust because I’m not sure there’s so much room in that aspect, I think it’s an atrocity.</span> <span id="s106">If I ever had a friend, which I haven’t, but if someone made light of it, then I would.</span> <span id="s107">I do talk about my grandparents because, as I mentioned earlier, they’re just spectacular people.</span> <span id="s108">I used to brag to my best friend about how many languages they spoke, and how they -- they have a very rich past, rich life.</span> <span id="s109">They’re very impressive and I admire them for that, and I’ve bragged countless of times.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: Is that interesting to you?</span> <span id="s111">I mean, to your friends?</span> <span id="s112">Do they want to know about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: It -- my friends were impressed.</span> <span id="s114">I -- I didn’t go into all the stories, but I -- I told them some and ther -- they’re entertaining, they’re funny.</span> <span id="s115">I never told them any of the really sad ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: Why not?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: You can think for a moment, if you want.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: [indecipherable] still like to know.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: Why didn’t I tell them sad ones?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: To be honest, I think that as they were my friends that I was telling these to, they were meant to be more entertaining.</span> <span id="s124">I was younger then.</span> <span id="s125">I don’t think that it would have been proper conversation material if I started going into the severity of the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: Did it also feel sort of private because it was something that affected your grandparent’s life very, very much?</span> <span id="s127">Do you feel like a little bit, protecting that part, or is that over interpreting?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: I don’t feel that, but there is actually -- I have mentioned how I lost a lot of my mother’s -- the family on my mom’s side.</span> <span id="s129">That does come to mind, I have told people that, because -- cause of they’re -- my father and my mother’s side is disproportional.</span> <span id="s130">But did I -- I did not mention how it actually came to be and how -- I me -- I know, of course, the history of how she hid up in the apartment and sh -- the rest of her family was down in the basement, with the whole remainder of the apartment building.</span> <span id="s131">I -- I -- I mean, I never told them that.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: Do you -- have you sort of -- do you feel that your -- your mother’s experience with those -- with that -- with her parents was -- was -- and hearing the stories was a little different than your own?</span> <span id="s133">Did you -- is there sort of a difference that you see?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: In hearing the stories?</span> <span id="s135">I don’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: Well, in her response maybe, to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: Do you mean by her upbringing, and how -- how --</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s139">That you were maybe a little bit more removed from it, I mean, that you can sort of -- I don’t know, I’m just fishing right now, to see whether -- you were listening, are you -- do you feel that you are listening to -- to your grandparents maybe in a slightly different way than your mother could?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: I don’t know if I’m listening to them differently, because I feel that I have a very strong connection to them.</span> <span id="s141">But I’m positive they had a much more profound influence on her just because she lived under them, and she must have told you in the other tapes.</span> <span id="s142">And I was just more removed from living with them, and they came up and when they came up, I -- you know, I had to finish all the food on my plate.</span> <span id="s143">But she had to live with that, so in that way I think she was more profoundly affected.</span> <span id="s144">I mean, she would -- never even would have considered to date someone that was not Jewish, whereas I did, despite I -- it greatly upset my mom, and even more so my grandparents.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: What does it mean for you to be Jewish?</span> <span id="s146">What --</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: To be Jewish is, for me it’s my identity and for me it’s more a part of me than a religious aspect, it’s more a way of life and a sense of pride in my identity, like I would say that I’m Jewish not because I believe in all the aspects of Judaism.</span> <span id="s148">I don’t keep kashrut and I don’t pray three times a day.</span> <span id="s149">And I’m not absolutely the most religious person I know.</span> <span id="s150">And yet I strongly identify myself as a Jew, and am very proud to be a Jew.</span> <span id="s151">And in that sense I feel that that’s my connection.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: You speak Hebrew.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: When -- when did you -- did you learn that in school, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: I -- I did learn Hebrew at school.</span> <span id="s156">I’ve learned some at home, my dad speaks Hebrew, very, very archaically, it’s the equivalent to what Shakespeare would be to English.</span> <span id="s157">It -- he speaks perfect Hebrew, whereas it hasn’t been modified by the slang and the colloquial of Israel.</span> <span id="s158">My grandmother also speaks Hebrew.</span> <span id="s159">She taught it.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: Did you go to Israel?</span> <span id="s161">A: I’ve been to Israel s -- many times.</span> <span id="s162">I love Israel.</span> <span id="s163">I --</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: Talk a little bit more about -- about the country, what you love about it, and also about the family that you the -- that you have there, maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: I -- I don’t know where to begin about Israe -- it’s -- you know, it’s a huge topic, it’s beautiful in every way.</span> <span id="s166">The people are beautiful, the land is beautiful, the culture is beautiful.</span> <span id="s167">But my family, I -- I -- I do have family there.</span> <span id="s168">I’m not very close to much of it, except for my grandmother’s sister, whose my grand-aunt, and I’ve been -- she used to have a kibbutz in Israel and I was there several times, and I visit her every time I go up to Israel, and some of my cousins, but besides that there’s some family I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: You just don’t know them well enough, or you don’t relate to them for some reason?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: I don’t even think I’ve met all of my family.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: Let’s talk about the family of your -- the other grandparents, from -- from your father’s side.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: From my dad’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s174">How do you -- how are they, how do you relate to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: My -- my grandparents on his side?</span> <span id="s176">I -- I don’t really relate to them at all.</span> <span id="s177">I’m not close to his mother, and his father died at a young -- when I was young.</span> <span id="s178">I wasn’t very close to him either.</span> <span id="s179">I was always much, much more close to my mother’s parents than my father’s.</span> <span id="s180">And that -- that was since I was a young child.</span> <span id="s181">[indecipherable] question.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: And had that to do, had -- yeah, sort of.</span> <span id="s183">I just have -- always have a little follow up.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: Yeah, that’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: Did that have to do with who they were, or did that have to do with that you just were more exposed to them, that you lived more closely to them, and then you get to know them better, or something [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: They -- they both live within a half an hour away and they’re each five hours from here, so no, we -- I went up, I saw each of them.</span> <span id="s187">We actually always slept at my father’s mom’s house.</span> <span id="s188">I -- I -- I don’t -- I don’t connect to her as I do to my mom’s parents.</span> <span id="s189">I honestly would like to be like my grandfather in so many ways.</span> <span id="s190">He’s an impressive man.</span> <span id="s191">I love my grandmother on my mom’s side too, she’s very kindhearted and sweet and warm and intelligent.</span> <span id="s192">And I don’t see that in my grandmother on my father’s side.</span> <span id="s193">I -- nothing strikes me as special about her.</span> <span id="s194">I don’t want to say that because --</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: Okay, we’ll leave that -- never mind, we’ll just leave it at that.</span> <span id="s196">I don’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: -- no, well, why don’t we do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: -- that -- that’s all right, I just want to know more about the other grandparents anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: Let’s go to your siblings.</span> <span id="s201">Do you -- d-do they have as -- do you think, from your perspective, do they have a similar relationship to your grandparents -- now talking about your mother’s parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: Or is there a different --</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: They’re too young, and they -- my grandparents are getting older, less patient.</span> <span id="s205">I -- th-there’s tension between the two occasionally.</span> <span id="s206">My -- out of the two sides, my grandparents and my brothers.</span> <span id="s207">They get along, but I don’t feel they have the same relationship that I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: When you talk to each other, your siblings[indecipherable] are there questions that they ask you that they don’t ask them, and -- to try to explain certain things, or do they relate to certain stories that they may have heard, differently than you?</span> <span id="s209">Do you have one example?</span> <span id="s210">I mean, I don’t want to belabor this, but if there’s something --</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: Regarding the Holocaust at least, as I said, I think they’re too young still.</span> <span id="s212">Aaron’s turning 13, Michael’s 10, and they’re much more interested in video games.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: You heard it at five though, or at four --</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: Well, I was told these stories firsthand.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: At that point I was much more in contact with my mother’s parents.</span> <span id="s217">I saw them -- we went up, and down to New Jersey.</span> <span id="s218">They came up much more frequently.</span> <span id="s219">And -- I’m trying to think back when I started reading all those books about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s220">And I would have -- I’d say yeah, you know, maybe 12, maybe 13.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: Was it difficult for you to sort of accept that something like that cou-could happen?</span> <span id="s222">Did you have, sort of, questions that you wondered about things, and could you bring that up somewhere, if you had those questions?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: I did have questions.</span> <span id="s224">One of my questions was my grandparents still believed in God.</span> <span id="s225">It’s such a enormous event, the Holocaust, it’s not easy to just treat -- even in an interview like this -- how can someone not wonder why something like that happened?</span> <span id="s226">And even when we see it again everywhere.</span> <span id="s227">Even now it’s -- I don’t know, I -- I-I -- I feel it’s different though.</span> <span id="s228">I feel like -- I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: Try.</span> <span id="s230">What’s -- what’s the diff -- what’s the -- what’s the difference?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: Between -- for me, the Holocaust, from the pictures I’ve created, from pictures I’ve seen, photographs, from movies, from books I’ve read, from my grandfather’s story, it just seems so much more atrocious than anything even now in the world today where similar things happen.</span> <span id="s232">Kosovo and Serbs, and -- and I just think it’s so much more terrible, and I -- I don’t know if that’s right, but I-I relate more to the Holocaust, obviously.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s234">Let’s talk a little bit about your family now.</span> <span id="s235">How do you see -- how do you see your mom and your dad and your siblings?</span> <span id="s236">Sort of describe a little bit the -- the family, the relationships that you have.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: Well, I’ll start it out with my mom, cause I probably have the closest relationship with her.</span> <span id="s238">And she’s a very warm woman just like my grandmother.</span> <span id="s239">She’s very understanding.</span> <span id="s240">We -- as I child, I -- I must have -- you know, I -- she was always the one that would buy me clothes and take me to get a haircut.</span> <span id="s241">I was always closer to her than my father.</span> <span id="s242">And I used to play games with her and chess and every night she used to sing me Shema and she used to read to me.</span> <span id="s243">I’m very close to her.</span> <span id="s244">A couple -- and part of it was because I had a girlfriend that was, in addition to being non-Jewish, not really the nicest of people.</span> <span id="s245">And my mom and her didn't get along at all.</span> <span id="s246">And that, maybe my mom’s work, other aspects led to tension and for the last year or so things have become more tense and she’s had a shorter fuse and been more irate.</span> <span id="s247">But now I -- now that I broke up with her, my -- my ex-girlfriend now, I feel that things are getting -- you know, they are much better.</span> <span id="s248">I’m very close to my mom again, I hardly fight.</span> <span id="s249">With my dad also, I don’t -- we used fight all the time, it used to be an issue of he’d say do this, I’d no, I don’t want to.</span> <span id="s250">Now, I -- I -- I help out.</span> <span id="s251">You know, he instilled in me a set of values that’s th -- what the two of them really wanted to achieve, and I think they have.</span> <span id="s252">His main goal was to leave a legacy behind, and I think he accomplished that, and I get along with both of them now.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: In terms of a legacy, in terms of what, a f -- a family, a profession of life?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: His legacy on my -- my dad’s legacy would have to be one of principle.</span> <span id="s255">My grandfather’s -- of course he wants to leave a legacy behind, and that is of the Holocaust and his survival.</span> <span id="s256">And he feels, and I feel the same way, that he shouldn’t survive to see his heritage lost.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: Do you feel that you want to contribute, or that you can, or that you even should contribute to that in some way, to keep memory alive, somewhat?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: I certainly do.</span> <span id="s259">And I don’t doubt for a second that I will be telling my children and showing them in the movies, and reading them the books, of course when they become old enough to be able to understand.</span> <span id="s260">And teaching them about the Holocaust too, because I think it’s extremely important that they know what their heritage is and where they came from.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: Yeah, I think we should flip over the cassette at this point.</span> <span id="s262">This is the end of tape one, interview with Dustin Dezube, and it’s side A.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Dustin Dezube.</span> <span id="s265">This is tape number one, side B. Okay, let’s talk about your own aspirations then, for your own family.</span> <span id="s266">How do you think you’re going to bring up your own kids, if you want them?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: I do want kids, and I would like them to remain Jewish as well.</span> <span id="s268">I, myself, when I was dating a non-Jew as I mentioned -- I would never marry a non-Jew.</span> <span id="s269">If it was a non-Jew I was dating seriously, I would exp -- implicitly -- although I would have to bring it up at one point, that she would convert to Judaism.</span> <span id="s270">If I had a daughter, I would want her to marry a Jew, as well as if I had a son, although I’m not sure I would disown them as I’ve often been threatened myself by my grandparents.</span> <span id="s271">I would be very disappointed, and I think that would put some tension on our relationship.</span> <span id="s272">I hope though that won’t be an issue, and I hope to raise my daughter with the notion that that’s how it should be.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: Your grandfather told me that you went to Israel once with a youth group, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: What -- what did you do, what was the purpose of that trip and what did you do there?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: It was sponsored by the sawha, which is the Israeli army, and I toured Israel with members of the army, and I participated in gonof for a couple weeks, which is boot camp, basically.</span> <span id="s277">And I went around and I got a new perspective than another tour group might have given me.</span> <span id="s278">It was very interesting and I connected, and I’ve often been asked to join the American army now that I’m a senior.</span> <span id="s279">I have recruiters calling me constantly, but if I was to join an army, I’d much rather be part of the sawha than the United States army.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: I feel I connect to them more.</span> <span id="s282">I -- I connect to Israel more than America because in Israel everyone’s Jewish.</span> <span id="s283">I have family there, and I have a history going back.</span> <span id="s284">I have learned about it since I was five years old, about Israel, about the temples, about the western wall, the [indecipherable], everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: What about your friends here?</span> <span id="s286">Are they all Jewish, or do you also have non-Jewish friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: I have -- I live -- I used to be sheltered in a parochial school, and all of my friends were then Jewish.</span> <span id="s288">When I entered high school, the atmosphere is not, of course all Jewish, and I have a lot of friends that are not Jewish.</span> <span id="s289">But I do live in a community that despite being, you know, o-open to everyone, of course, there is a large percentage of Jews.</span> <span id="s290">It’s a large Jewish community.</span> <span id="s291">So I do have friends that are non-Jews, and I -- but I also have a lot of friends that are Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: What kind of hobbies do you have, and what do you want to become, in terms of profession, what are, sort of, your aspirations?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: I like to play pool.</span> <span id="s294">I like to play basketball.</span> <span id="s295">I -- my -- in terms of profession, I -- I want to go into gene therapy.</span> <span id="s296">I think that’s a fascinating field.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: Into gene therapy?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: Gene therapy, I’m taking an internship next semester at Genzyme, which is a -- it -- it works with genes, it’s a genetic industry.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: What interests you particularly about that, the scientific challenge, the -- I don’t want to lead you here, just --</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: The scientific challenge.</span> <span id="s301">It’s a breakthough field.</span> <span id="s302">What -- it -- it has so little boundaries, it’s amazing.</span> <span id="s303">You could take it anywhere.</span> <span id="s304">It’s the building blocks of life, you can understand everything, it’s just so fascinating.</span> <span id="s305">That’s another issue, it’s -- it’s hard to go into.</span> <span id="s306">I -- this diverges completely from --</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: That’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: -- the Holocaust, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: It’s part of your life though, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: It -- it is.</span> <span id="s311">But with genes, you can -- you can fix what went wrong in nature.</span> <span id="s312">If someone has diabetes, you can insert the right sequence.</span> <span id="s313">And it’s so small, but you can insert it into them and they can start producing insulin themselves, rather than have to take it from a pig.</span> <span id="s314">And that’s amazing, I think, that you can change something like that and of course once you get on that level, and if -- we’re not there yet, but eventually you can cure all sorts of things, all ailments, you know, cancer, you can -- and I don’t want -- I don’t want to tamper with hu-humanity and I -- it’s not my idea to make a perfect race, or you know, make everyone’s IQ 150.</span> <span id="s315">But just to help people that have specific ailments.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: How do you feel about today’s Germany.</span> <span id="s317">Have you ever talked to a German?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: I’ve never talked to a German that wasn’t Jewish, except I -- I know one girl that’s German, but she’s -- she’s a classmate, she’s -- she’s younger than me.</span> <span id="s319">She’s a freshman now.</span> <span id="s320">And never about her.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: You’re the first German I’ve probably spoken to and -- and I -- you’ve told me some things, and I -- I have wondered, do Germans relate to the Holocaust?</span> <span id="s323">What is there -- what’s the general attitude and I’m extremely interested over what it would be for the different generations.</span> <span id="s324">How -- what -- what did survivors from that period -- or not survivors, but the generation in -- that participated in the Holocaust, what do they feel now?</span> <span id="s325">What do their -- what does the second generation feel, what about the third?</span> <span id="s326">And yeah, I have wondered about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: And there are few books here, right?</span> <span id="s328">One can’t really read about it much.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: I haven’t seen anything about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: Could you imagine going to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: I could.</span> <span id="s332">I could imagine going to Germany, and I think that would be worthwhile to find out.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: When you heard that I would interview you today, what did you sort of -- have I asked you the question that you expected me to ask, or is there something that you really wanted to talk about?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: Some of the questions were different, but they were along the lines that I expected.</span> <span id="s335">I wasn’t sure if you’d go more into depth over the Holocaust itself, and hit different aspects of that.</span> <span id="s336">But aside from that, I -- I feel that you’ve covered everything that I expected and more.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: Mm.</span> <span id="s338">I guess that was the question --</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: This is a --</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: -- more like should we, is there something missing that we sort of --</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: Yeah</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: -- sort of should address in terms of friends, interests, your grandparents, your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: I mean, there’s some topics that I could go and on about if time permitted.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: Like what -- now that you mention it.</span> <span id="s345">That was a dangerous thing to mention.</span> <span id="s346">Like what?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: Not -- not even Israel but my -- my grandparents, you know.</span> <span id="s350">I mean, I’ve had such a close relationship to them, and they’ve profoundly influenced my life, and I could just go on about that for --</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: D-Do that a little bit more, if you don’t mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: It’s just that they -- they’ve had a very strong impact on me, not -- not just in terms of the Holocaust, but it was always up to their expectations that I hoped to live.</span> <span id="s353">I-I-In terms of grades, I used to tell them how well I did in school, and not so much my parents, that I care about what they -- what they thought, but my grandparents.</span> <span id="s354">I never wanted -- I mean, I still do -- I don’t ever want to disappoint them.</span> <span id="s355">And I always try very hard not to, whether it’s by getting good grades or dating a Jew.</span> <span id="s356">And it meant always a lot to me, what they thought, their opinions.</span> <span id="s357">And I -- I -- I -- I love them, they’re just incredible people.</span> <span id="s358">And they came up for my Bar Mitzvah, they came up for my graduation from eighth grade.</span> <span id="s359">We’re very close.</span> <span id="s360">I remember from my [indecipherable] graduation, which was Hebrew high school, it was the Sunday school that I continued, my grandfather came up, even after there was some issue with his heart.</span> <span id="s361">And I’m -- it me-meant a lot to me, and I’m -- I’m -- I just try to, not make them happy, but live my life in a way that would make them proud.</span> <span id="s362">Whereas I don’t do that for my father’s mom, or -- or for even my parents, because I’m -- I’m close enough to my parents -- I -- I-I’m close enough to my grandparents that I want to live up to their expectations, but I’m removed enough that I can -- that I can try to do that, whereas at home with my mom and my father, of course, they see everything what’s going on every single day.</span> <span id="s363">They know when something happens if I -- if I missed school today, if I played hooky.</span> <span id="s364">So it -- it’s a different relationship.</span> <span id="s365">And I would never want to really present -- I only want to present the best to my grandparents, whereas my parents get the whole -- the whole deal.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: The whole deal, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: Yeah, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: Yeah, well that’s -- that’s -- parents have to deal --</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: I want them to be -- I want my grandparents to be proud of me.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: Do you think there’s a little bit more patience in you deali -- being with your grandparents, a little more patience with how them dealing with you, than with your mother in this, somewhere?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: In terms of?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: In terms of with each other?</span> <span id="s373">Do you think you have more patience for your -- who your grandparents are than your mother could have, maybe, for some reason?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: Um --</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: Is it easier sometimes to be more understanding a little bit than -- across two generations apart than maybe from generation to generation, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: All right, I think I see what you’re asking.</span> <span id="s377">I m -- live in [indecipherable] I live a bunch of idioms in our language, sayings that sum up that some things don’t change.</span> <span id="s378">And you know, you let -- they’re two generations beyond, it’s not worth fighting over some certain points.</span> <span id="s379">And I -- I understand that.</span> <span id="s380">I understand where my grands-parents are coming from when they wanted me to eat everything in my plate.</span> <span id="s381">And maybe my mom wasn’t able -- she was a little less patient, but just probably because she had to live with it, whereas I don’t, and it’s -- it’s -- it’s -- it can be an ordeal.</span> <span id="s382">I have to -- I mean, as much as I love my grandparents, every time they come up I have to prep myself because I don’t have the luxury of just going to sleep when I’d want, you know I have to spend time with them, which I like to do, but I -- I can’t go out then, and if I had to live with that constantly, maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: We’re jumping back and forth, but maybe that’s kind of interesting in itself, too.</span> <span id="s384">A lot of people talk about lessons of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s385">For you personally, what -- what is something that you draw from -- from that terrible event, from knowing about it in ways that we cannot talk about quite, because the time is too short, and it’s too complex.</span> <span id="s386">But sort of what are the lessons, quote unquote, as you see them?</span> <span id="s387">At least now.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: The lessons are that you have to be proud of who you are.</span> <span id="s389">My mom tries to instill that in me.</span> <span id="s390">My grandparents tried to.</span> <span id="s391">And that believe it -- I think it’s true, you -- you can’t just not -- you -- you have to maintain a strong sense of identity to prevent these things from happening in the future.</span> <span id="s392">I’m getting back to the point I was saying, that even though I’m not really religious, I strongly identify myself as a Jew.</span> <span id="s393">And you need to stand up for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: As an American, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: As American, too.</span> <span id="s396">I think if people wanted me to, I don’t know, become a Canadian, I don’t -- maybe.</span> <span id="s397">I strongly identify myself -- not s -- even more as a Jew than as American.</span> <span id="s398">American is where I live.</span> <span id="s399">There’s y -- America’s a big mixing pot, there’s all different cultures.</span> <span id="s400">I’m a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s402">We’ll just leave it at that.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: This is the -- concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Dustin Dezube, this is tape one, side B, and thank you very much Dustin.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: No problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: Okay, bye.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: All right, have a good day.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">End of Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Conclusion of Interview</span></p> <p><span
