<p><span id="s12">False start, take 2 is up.</span> <span id="s13">Actually, we'll keep one, we'll repeat one.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">I want you to describe the transport and then the arrival in Auschwitz, and why don't you as you describe it, give me your age and ----------.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Well, the transport was approximately 4 days as we were, and there, there were so many so many things happened even before the transport that probably I will skip it in and go right into what you, to answer your question.</span> <span id="s16">There were, we had no water, we had very little food, just the food which we took from home before we had to board the cattle cars, and there were a lot of , lot of people died, mainly children and older people.</span> <span id="s17">For instance we were so compact, we were like Sardinians.</span> <span id="s18">If you sat, you couldn't get up, and vice-versa.</span> <span id="s19">At, on the fourth night we, we arrived to Auschwitz, and we had to wait, and the train was waiting.</span> <span id="s20">Then, all of the sudden the doors opened, slid open, and we were ordered out.</span> <span id="s21">As we stepped out, head prisoners called Kapos rushed at us using their whips and so did the SS.</span> <span id="s22">They were beating, they're kicking, they're hitting everyone they could reach.</span> <span id="s23">And we were ordered to form a line, stand in line, men in one, women and small children in the other.</span> <span id="s24">Why the whip and the kicking and the beating was going on, after we lined up, I noticed that a SS, high ranking SS officer approached.</span> <span id="s25">He, that was the infamous Dr. Josef Mengele.</span> <span id="s26">The angel of death.</span> <span id="s27">The man who would decide our fate.</span> <span id="s28">Instant death in a gas chamber or lingering life of ----------, slavery.</span> <span id="s29">We had to file by him.</span> <span id="s30">As we did, I noticed that he had slender stick, actually it was a conductor's baton, being a musician, even at 13, so I recognized it, and he was waving it to the right or the left.</span> <span id="s31">He was pointing which way each individual who filed by him to go.</span> <span id="s32">My mother and younger sister, my Goldie, who was only nine years old.</span> <span id="s33">She was motioned to the left, along with my mother.</span> <span id="s34">My older sister Violet was motioned to the opposite side, to the right.</span> <span id="s35">My brother Zoltan, who was 15 and my father they, they next were in line, they were also motioned to the same side where Violet, my older sister.</span> <span id="s36">By the way, Violet was 18, I don't know if I mentioned it or not.</span> <span id="s37">But my turn came.</span> <span id="s38">To my great surprise, Mengele stopped me, motioned to stop, and he says, "Tell me little boy, how old are you?"</span> <span id="s39">"I am 13," I replied.</span> <span id="s40">Previously coached to say more than I was because this way I had a better chance to survive, and being sent to work rather than being sent immediately to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s41">When he was, Mengele was sort of looking at me with a suspicion, suspiciously, because I really didn't look, no, not even 13.</span> <span id="s42">My frail body, and pale, you know I didn't go out to play foot, football, soccer with the boys, but I was always practicing the violin.</span> <span id="s43">So, but miraculously he was motioning me to the group where my father and brother were.</span> <span id="s44">After the selection was were over, my mother, my younger sister, and the group that they were in were led away.</span> <span id="s45">I didn't, now that I've seen them, did -------.</span> <span id="s46">They were taken direct to the gas chamber, and they were told that that you have to take a shower, in order to camouflage really what they wanted to do, the SS will issue a towel and a bar of soap.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">We better stop for the siren.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Sync take 2 is up.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Beep.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">After the selections were over, my mother, my younger sister, and the group they were in were led away.</span> <span id="s51">I didn't know that I have seen them for the last time.</span> <span id="s52">They were taken directly to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s53">There was actually a house where was written the words, "Bade."</span> <span id="s54">Means bath.</span> <span id="s55">And each one of them were issued a bar of soap and a towel, and then they said, "You have to go in there and take a shower," but in reality, that was the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s56">As soon as they went in, the doors were locked behind them, and then the gas was flowing, and everybody had died.</span> <span id="s57">The terrible thing, maybe, to add to that, I should say, was that then the SS would send some of us prisoners to go and pick up the dead bodies and cart them away.</span> <span id="s58">When, when we were just getting to ourselves what happened, we were taken to uh another barrack, we were stripped completely, and had to take a little shower, and the very same gas chamber where these won-wonderful people and the poor, poor children were taken and were gassed, we really took a shower.</span> <span id="s59">When the, the gas where there were flowing through the pipes, now they let water through.</span> <span id="s60">I know because I was in it also to shower in reality.</span> <span id="s61">Then we were assigned to a barrack.</span> <span id="s62">We managed somehow to stay together.</span> <span id="s63">My father, my brother Zoltan and me.</span> <span id="s64">And one night, as we were standing in line to be count-counted, that was the final count, and Kapo, which means head prisoner, and we're going to be fair from now on, they were as a Kapo, came to our line, and he was picking prisoners for what they call a Zonder commando.</span> <span id="s65">And he, among other prisoners, he picked me too.</span> <span id="s66">A Zonder Commando had to go around to the camp, and pick up the dead, only the dead bodies, and cart them up to the crematorium.</span> <span id="s67">Now being in the Zonder commando, that meant separation from my father and brother.</span> <span id="s68">I was assigned to a different barrack.</span> <span id="s69">And, one occasion as I was picking up a body, I noticed that this, this man was not dead at all.</span> <span id="s70">And I turned to the Kapo, and I said, "Herr Kapo," you know, uh, "If we would give a little food or a little water, this man would, would survive."</span> <span id="s71">And then he turned around and hit me with his fist in my face so hard that I fell over, and he said, "You are not here to tell me who would survive.</span> <span id="s72">We're not here to make people survive.</span> <span id="s73">Now if you're not going to uh keep your mouth shut, I'm going to put you in the crematorium also.</span> <span id="s74">Now pick up that body, and put him up," and we did it, I, I didn't say no more, anything.</span> <span id="s75">But, all my life, even today, even as I am telling you this, I have the most awful feeling that I really had to burn my fellow prisoners, had to go and cart them out to the crematorium so that they would be burned, and they were alive.</span> <span id="s76">So we were doing this for about oh maybe 6 days.</span> <span id="s77">Now in that group where I was working the Zonder Commando, there was another Commando, a father...</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Now we do have to reload.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Beep.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Beep.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">To my great surprise, Mengele stopped me and talked to me, and he was asking, "Tell me little boy, how old are you?"</span> <span id="s82">I said, "I'm 16 and I can prove it."</span> <span id="s83">And I was gesturing to go into my pocket because I had the, this birth certificate that we falsified birth certificate, because previously my father, when we still, when we're still home, I have to qualify that we're, we're told, we were told by--unless you, you do, your minor children, like I was 13 before, I mean uh, before we were taken you know, and uh my uh sister was 9 years old so unless is getting uh different birth certificates, we're not going to survive.</span> <span id="s84">Now, we children didn't know about it, but our father did.</span> <span id="s85">So, paid a lot of money for that, but we did get certificates.</span> <span id="s86">So I pulled out, uh, but, he was looking at me, and miraculously he mo-waved me to the group where my father and my brother were .</span> <span id="s87">Now in the Zonder Commando, there was a man who was about same age as my father, and he had a son who was in the same barrack where my father and brother were, and the son was about the same age, maybe a year or two older than I, and he heard, word came to him that the very same barrack where his son was going to be evacuated, and they're going to go to France the very next day.</span> <span id="s88">So, he contrived an ingenious plan, and he says, listen, I tell you what, because you like to be with your father and brother, and I certainly love to be with my son.</span> <span id="s89">Now, when you see that all the prisoners running from every direction to regroup the final count, in the evening, go in, go into the line where my son is, and my son is going to take, get into this line, where this barrack line is and no one, nobody the wiser because we were only numbers, so the plan worked.</span> <span id="s90">He was reunited with his son, and I got back in the barrack where my father and brother were.</span> <span id="s91">Next morning, next day, we were off to France.</span> <span id="s92">I found out later that the very same day when we were transported to France, that all the Zonder Commandos were killed because the SS feared if one of the commandos or not, uh specifically the commandos, would escape, would tell the world of the atrocities, and of the, the terrible thing which the SS did to humanity.</span> <span id="s93">Because we were more witnesses to their uh machine, you know, death machine, than any other prisoners, because we were the one who were picking up dead bodies and, and took them and burned them on their order.</span> <span id="s94">And, I tell you, the image of this father and son will haunt me for the rest of my life.</span> <span id="s95">Now in, when we arrived in France, I was put to uh work in an ammunition factory, and in that factory they were making, it was and build a, I don't know exactly if the V-2 rocket, but rocket which was designed specifically to shoot airplanes, and of course, mainly the Americans and the Russians, and that was su-a such a tremendous force, they would, they would all the, all the uh the airplane if, if it got in contact with a rocket it would be torn to pieces.</span> <span id="s96">I was cutting parts to that rocket.</span> <span id="s97">Then, later, I was put to a machine which automatically filled explosive caps with the gun powder.</span> <span id="s98">One day a French prisoner approached me and he says, "What would you do to stop Hitler's madness?</span> <span id="s99">Would you give up your life?"</span> <span id="s100">Without hesitation, I said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s101">Now, I was operating a machine at that point, as I, I think I mentioned that, which beside filling uh, uh gun powder, we have to go back to that, I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s102">Yeah.</span> <span id="s103">Can I do that now?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">This French captain, uh forgive me, this French man, is, I forgot to tell, uh, what his rank was.</span> <span id="s106">He was actually a uh, captain in the underground movement, resistance movement, who was smuggled among us as a prisoner, and he organized a sabotage movement.</span> <span id="s107">So, this is how he approached me and if I would be, because to him, I was the most important person by, by working on that machine which filled gun powder, the caps with the gun powder, and he said to me, "I tell you what.</span> <span id="s108">You see those civilians?</span> <span id="s109">Those are all French men.</span> <span id="s110">Electricians.</span> <span id="s111">They were working around the ammunition factory."</span> <span id="s112">And he says, "I tell you what you do.</span> <span id="s113">Now these men will supply you sand, and I want you to put in this capsule which you've been filling with gun powder, sand and very little gun powder.</span> <span id="s114">So the machine that I was working would be filling the gun powder automatically as I just, all I had to do is just put it on.</span> <span id="s115">But now I had to put sand and mix, mix it with the gunpowder.</span> <span id="s116">And it worked.</span> <span id="s117">I mean it was fantastic how easy it really was to do that.</span> <span id="s118">One day, some new transport came with new prisoners, and another prisoner was put in that very near me, the machine, working, cutting parts, and it turned out that that was an a SS spy, wanted to know, they already detected, they were, they found out that this weapon, the second stage in impact did not work.</span> <span id="s119">And that was the idea.</span> <span id="s120">I didn't know that, I found out later that the sand was needed to uh, uh how can I say that stop the second stage from exploding, and uh, our leader was identified, this French captain.</span> <span id="s121">He was hanged, and all of us who were around that area had to watch him die, and we were not allowed to avert our eyes from him nor move away.</span> <span id="s122">After that, about 60 of us put, were put in, in a horizontal line and asked to stand still.</span> <span id="s123">Other words still stand, or stand at attention maybe in, in uh English, and an SS officer was going down the line picking prisoners at random.</span> <span id="s124">He passed me, and then was coming back and passed me again, they picked my right the one next time.</span> <span id="s125">And the third time he still went down the line just looking at prisoners which he sort of wanted to kill and passed me again.</span> <span id="s126">Three times I was to be taken to be shot to death, and all three times I was passed by.</span> <span id="s127">Now the ones that were chosen, they had to step out of line, they were taken out of the camp and shot to death.</span> <span id="s128">We were sent back to the barrack, and then were sent some Kapos and we had a beating in a ---------.</span> <span id="s129">I can't tell you we, our...face and, and body and, and, and were puffed up and, and uh as many of them, their ribs were broken in because we were around that area.</span> <span id="s130">Now I was a saboteur, and I got a, a uh sort of a form like a uh half circle written on my back and I, I 'saboteur.'</span> <span id="s131">(Sandy talking in background).</span></p> <p><span id="s132">You can just start with "I was a saboteur."</span> <span id="s133">I was a saboteur, and then go on.</span> <span id="s134">So I was a saboteur, and I was marked as such, on the, on the jacket of my back, and every time, I, any, a Kapo would pass by me or an SS officer or an SS guard, either would spat at me, spit on me or kick me, so, I believe in God because God saved my life so many times that that I was not patriot, in spite of all the three times that the SS went by picking people at random, um passed me by.</span> <span id="s135">I don't believe that was a coincidence.</span> <span id="s136">And uh, it was God's way of protecting me.</span> <span id="s137">And anyway, about two weeks later that I had that Saboteur jacket, all the jackets were taken from everybody, and for the, I couldn't belie-believe it, we had back new jackets which was clean, and the word saboteur disappeared off, off of my jacket, so I was again not molested anymore as a saboteur, but freely could walk back and forth over where I was working.</span> <span id="s138">So, I also give credit to God for that.</span> <span id="s139">Now, I must tell you something is an extremely interesting, and maybe one of the million or ten million or hundred million that can happen.</span> <span id="s140">I have to go to Cleveland, Ohio for a second, uh because it's, we are still with that sabotage things.</span> <span id="s141">Uh, when I was in Cleveland in 19, in 1958, --------------fifty, I was studying in the university, and um, one of my ---------uh gave me a check.</span> <span id="s142">Now he was an American, Hungarian and Jewish like myself, except I was not American unfortunately, and uh, he gave me a check to pay up a debt, which I uh, had been paying, paying, and never got smaller, so he says, "Go in any bank, and cash it."</span> <span id="s143">But you see, he didn't have an account in that bank or any bank in that area, and I didn't have an account anywhere at any bank.</span> <span id="s144">So, in fact, I didn't even speak English, very little, and I said to him, "How do I do this?</span> <span id="s145">I mean," "Oh no," he says, "It's very simple, here's the check, all you do is go up to the teller, and just say, cash, cash, give me cash."</span> <span id="s146">I said, "That's all?"</span> <span id="s147">He says, "Yeah."</span> <span id="s148">Now I went into, looked around where is a bank and I'm coming from uh around lunchtime you know and I had --------you had to go back to school in the afternoon classes.</span> <span id="s149">So I saw a bank, so I go in there.</span> <span id="s150">Cleveland Trust, I remember now.</span> <span id="s151">And, I went up to, waited in line and went up to what was the teller, put down and I said, "Cash cash."</span> <span id="s152">And and he looked at me, so other words, we couldn't communicate.</span> <span id="s153">So he was a compassionate man, he said, "Okay, just a second."</span> <span id="s154">He came from his window and escorted me to the President's office.</span> <span id="s155">Now he spoke several languages.</span> <span id="s156">Now we're going to find out what this foreigner wants, he thought, probably.</span> <span id="s157">So, I started with uh, I spoke to the uh it was the President of the bank, and I said, uh "Parlez francaise?"</span> <span id="s158">"Sprechens-y Duetshce?" "</span> <span id="s159">----------Hungarian."</span> <span id="s160">He says, "Spreche Duetsche."</span> <span id="s161">I'm I speak German.</span> <span id="s162">Thank God.</span> <span id="s163">So we start, and we waited a little because the teller had to find out if there is money on this account, and he says to me, "-------------------," speak French, are you French?</span> <span id="s164">I said, "No, I'm a Transylvanian."</span> <span id="s165">But I was in France, and looking at my violin case being next to me, he says, "Did you study music there?"</span> <span id="s166">I said, "No."</span> <span id="s167">But then I relented what I doing in France, that I was doing sabotage, putting sand instead of uh filling up with sand you know with gun powder, and when, when actually uh one of these uh planes are what the plane would be obliterated.</span> <span id="s168">And he stood, from, he sprung up from his chair, ran, ran to me, grab my hand, "God bless you, God bless you."</span> <span id="s169">I said, "Thank you.</span> <span id="s170">Thank you."</span> <span id="s171">I mean blessing comes always well, so I thank you for it."</span> <span id="s172">He says, "No please," he saw my puzzled face, he says, "Please let me explain.</span> <span id="s173">My son and nine crew, he was a captain over nine crew, and they were bombing around that area where the ammunition factory was, and they were shot with one of these rockets, which penetrated the airplane but did not explode.</span> <span id="s174">I think they were caught on the wing, and or the tail, whatever, and when they got back to the bases, very carefully, they took that weapon, that rocket apart to see why did not explode, they found sand in the capsule."</span> <span id="s175">So we both hugged and started to cry, and I knew, I knew then that if I would have been killed and died, it would not be in vain, because I knew that at least ten people, nine, nine plus the captain, ten lives were saved because of my sabotage.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">I want to jump to the incident in the salt mines.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Okay, with my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">--------------electric wires, that resistance because, before we run out.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">In September, we were transferred from France into Copendorf, which was a, a large salt mine, and was a terrible grueling work, and, and day of Yom Kippur, all of the sudden the whole area of the salt mine became dark, completely dark, and we put our uh hammers down and uh sat down immediately.</span> <span id="s181">A little rest, at least a little rest.</span> <span id="s182">We thought it was God's will that on Yom Kippur at least, you know, sending us something, darkness that we can rest, and one of, one of the prisoners started to chanting the -----------------, and honestly, I can hear it, I can hear it now, like, then the other one got into, and then another one.</span> <span id="s183">We were also about 60 to 80 persons around there, and we're sitting, and then even those who did not know the words, and they did not probably even know the melody, but they were humming along, along, and in, in a miracle too, the entire section was full of, of, of, of the ----------------, the song of, of the Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s184">We didn't know that the SS, we were not aware of it that the SS were listening in.</span> <span id="s185">Within ten minutes, the whole problem was found, restored and the light came on.</span> <span id="s186">Then we found out what was the source of the darkness.</span> <span id="s187">One of us in fact, it, he was which I did not put in my book that was a Hungarian uh Jew who used to show, in, he had secretly hidden his wife's and his little son's picture, and that gave him a little bit of will of, of, of living because constantly we had to talk him out of committing suicide, constantly, and my father was the one who always said, "No, you'll see, we're going to survive," and you know.</span> <span id="s188">But, he couldn't stand it any longer, and he went and cut the wire with the uh spoon made into sharpen the, like it was like a knife.</span> <span id="s189">He was beaten severely until he fell unconscious.</span> <span id="s190">Then we had to form another line, exactly like it was in France, and one was picked, the other one was let go, then he passed, the SS passed 2 then picked the third one the fourth, then again.</span> <span id="s191">So, here half of them were picked, taken out and shot to death.</span> <span id="s192">I also again was bypassed.</span> <span id="s193">So, I have, you have to, you have to puzzle, you have to think how come I didn't, I was saved one day before I would be killed as Zonder Commando, then in France I was bypassed three times.</span> <span id="s194">Now again, coincidences maybe.</span> <span id="s195">Who knows?</span> <span id="s196">I believe differently.</span> <span id="s197">So, we were severely beaten, the one that they were not picked.</span> <span id="s198">In, still in Copendorf, in February, my father turned 42.</span> <span id="s199">So my Wait we are going to run out.</span> <span id="s200">We should just start another roll.</span> <span id="s201">We're going to run out in about ten seconds.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Beep.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">In February 1945, my father turned 42, and we didn't have nothing to give him.</span> <span id="s204">We at home always used to exchange gifts.</span> <span id="s205">We children would put our little pennies together to buy for our parents' anniversary or, or birthday, but here we had nothing.</span> <span id="s206">The Nazis stripped us of everything.</span> <span id="s207">So I came up with the idea to give a ration of bread for a day to him as a birthday present, and I told Zolton, and he liked the idea.</span> <span id="s208">So, in the evening, we held out our hands, said, "Father, for you."</span> <span id="s209">He wouldn't think of it.</span> <span id="s210">He knew that bread, it means nourishment, it means life.</span> <span id="s211">We were starving.</span> <span id="s212">In fact we were on starving ration and that was the idea, let them work as long as they can and then drop dead, and then they're just going to take them away.</span> <span id="s213">We were not there really ever, ever to leave the concentration camp, any of us, none of us, but here's the bread, "No way," he says, "I'm not going to take it.</span> <span id="s214">You need that little nourishment."</span> <span id="s215">But we ins--kept on insisting so finally, not wanting to hurt our feelings, he accepted the gift, and he said, "Thank God that allowed me to live long enough to witness that gracious love from my sons."</span> <span id="s216">It was like, like he would have sensed being his last day on earth.</span> <span id="s217">Next morning at 5 o clock, we were already in line to go to the salt mines, but one prisoner was missing.</span> <span id="s218">After several recounts, the prisoner was still missing.</span> <span id="s219">The Kapo sent him to the barrack to look for him.</span> <span id="s220">They found a missing person sleeping in a corner, my father, so they dragged him in front of the SS, they picked him up from the cover, and it was bitter winter, and he just had his, his underalls on, his uh practically nothing, and he was ordered to stand still or at attention, and then the Kapo went to the SS and was whispering something, so when the SS turned to the and they asked the uh assembly and they said, "I understand that that dirty Jewish dog has here two sons.</span> <span id="s221">I want them to step out of line and come next to him and see what his punishment going to be because he kept Germany from victory ten minutes, because that's how long it took to find him.</span> <span id="s222">Then he gave a hard swift kick to my father , and this signaled the kapos to start it, the punishment.</span> <span id="s223">For every, every for every side, every corner, they started hitting him, kicking and beating him until he fell on the ground and Zolton and I begged, went on our knees, and went, begged the SS to s-to stop it and went and tried to grab the arm of the Kapos, then the, the hitting and the beating and the whipping were on our backs.</span> <span id="s224">And they were beating my father until he collapsed, and was so badly beaten he was unrecognizable.</span> <span id="s225">I started to chant the 22nd song.</span> <span id="s226">----------------------------.</span> <span id="s227">Oh God, my God, why hast thou forsaken us?</span> <span id="s228">So the beating finally stopped when my father was motionless, except for his lips, and I saw that he was trying, trying to say something, and I came close, and then I heard he was reciting the Shamah, the Declaration of the Faith of the Jew to God, and it says, "----------------------------------------," Hear Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one.</span> <span id="s229">Then he became very silent.</span> <span id="s230">He didn't speak no more.</span> <span id="s231">He didn't move no more.</span> <span id="s232">We went, Zolton and I we went off to the salt mine.</span> <span id="s233">The first time in my life that I lost faith in God.</span> <span id="s234">I was born in an Orthodox family.</span> <span id="s235">My father was a wonderful, wonderful human being, a very pious Jew.</span> <span id="s236">That he wouldn't harm a soul.</span> <span id="s237">In fact, in the concentration camp, he kept people alive, really alive, the lots of them went and touched the barbed wire to end, they couldn't stand it any longer, and he used to say, "No, no, you'll see, like God sent Moses to get the children of Israel out of Egypt, of our bondage, you'll see that he will send somebody to free us, and in fact, to take us back to Aris Israel."</span> <span id="s238">That means go to our homeland, Israel, and it was like, like, like he foresaw that.</span> <span id="s239">Like uh it was a prediction or, or not a prediction it was a, a prophecy sort of, you know.</span> <span id="s240">Now that wonderful man, no more.</span> <span id="s241">And I said, if God allowed that to happen, there is no God.</span> <span id="s242">If, if God allowed for, for him to be killed, then I don't believe anymore, and it thank God that it didn't last long because on the very same night, in my dream, my father appeared, and he said, called me on my Hebrew name "Yitzhok," he says, "Don't ever lose your faith in God.</span> <span id="s243">God is real.</span> <span id="s244">And you'll see that you will survive."</span> <span id="s245">What was, what was so strange to me that he said, "You," singular.</span> <span id="s246">He didn't say the plural, "You," meant that you and Zolton will survive.</span> <span id="s247">He said, "You will survive."</span> <span id="s248">Meanwhile, Zolton was so angry and so out of beside him uh what we witnessed that said uh, he's going to go and spring a -------, grab this SS guards, or SS officers neck and he's going to choke him to death.</span> <span id="s249">I said, "You couldn't get two feet next to him, close to him.</span> <span id="s250">Not even two feet, you will be shot."</span> <span id="s251">He says, "No, I will do it.</span> <span id="s252">You'll see I will do it," and Zolton was even though he was not quite 16 years old, he was very, very strong, since what like some people practice God knows what all day long, he was muscle build up, bodybuilder, I mean it incredibly so, and he says, "No, and I just go and I crush him to death because he killed our father."</span> <span id="s253">And I said, "Zolton, I tell you something.</span> <span id="s254">A miracle happened Zolton, my father appeared to me in my dream, and he said we should believe there is a God, and we should never lose our faith in God because we going to survive."</span> <span id="s255">He said that.</span> <span id="s256">You know our father, even in dream, said, he never said anything that wasn't so.</span> <span id="s257">So Zolton gave up the idea killing because that would be killing himself right away.</span> <span id="s258">Now, not long after that in the beginning of April, we were transferred at, from, from Copendorf to Dachau.</span> <span id="s259">The trip from Copendorf to Dachau was the worst that I have ever accounted.</span> <span id="s260">On one occa-one instance, in one occasion the SS stopped the train, there were American fliers very, very low, they wanted to see what is the train because there always cattle cars, you know.</span> <span id="s261">We were transported in cattle cars, we were so packed that I'm, I'm, I'm telling you worse than when we went to, to Dachau, I mean to uh Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s262">The Dachau trip was the worst I have ever, ever experienced.</span> <span id="s263">We were, for instance, you couldn't even sit down.</span> <span id="s264">Once you sat, like the same thing uh in Auschwitz, except in Ausch----------going to in Auschwitz, it was a little more, uh even if you didn't have uh no food and no water, but at least there was some more room that we could move a little bit better, but here there was no way, and the worst was that if you tried to move, then a bickering among uh prisoners themselves because they were trying and were shoving and pushing and, and, and, and were hitting uh with, with the elbows among prisoners.</span> <span id="s265">So, what happened is the American fliers came low enough because they want to see the SS stop the train and took cover under it and start shooting at the at the uh, uh airplane, at the pilot, fighter pilots.</span> <span id="s266">They shot back.</span> <span id="s267">The Americans shot back, and the bullets would go through the top of the cattle car, unfortunately hitting quite a few of the prisoners, and one man who, who was standing, now you could not sit down anymore, and there was a three days trip.</span> <span id="s268">He was all of the sudden says, "I am hit!"</span> <span id="s269">And then slowly he was going down and he landed on my foot.</span> <span id="s270">He was moaning, he was hurting terribly say, "Shut up, shut up, don't, don't move, don't scream."</span> <span id="s271">So the next, about a few hours later, he died right on my foot, and in ----------I was trying to push him off, because it was terrible, my food got numb, and I couldn't feel anymore but it was so uncomfortable, and I tried to push him off, and the others wouldn't let.</span> <span id="s272">There were j-just no room.</span> <span id="s273">There were absolutely none.</span> <span id="s274">So, when we finally arrived at Dachau, I was overwhelmed with happiness seeing from the other car, Zolton my brother also survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">We have to reload.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Beep.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Beep.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Second sticks??</span></p> <p><span id="s279">After we arrived at Dachau, I knew if something wouldn't happen soon, I would not survive.</span> <span id="s280">I could hardly walk, let alone do the chores or the work that I was required to do.</span> <span id="s281">For a second I'd like to go back to my childhood.</span> <span id="s282">When I was 4 years old, I got lost in a forest.</span> <span id="s283">My governess took us, took, we went for a walk, and we landed in the forest, and she sat down, after a while we got tired, and she said, later that she fell asleep, and when she woke up, I was nowhere to be found.</span> <span id="s284">I was wandering around and hopelessly lost, I started crying, and a little gypsy woman, a young gypsy woman I should say, was picking mushrooms, flowers, heard my cry and took me into their Gypsy camp, and that, this the first time in my life that I heard violin music, and it was beautiful.</span> <span id="s285">They could make it sound like a bird, chirp like a bird.</span> <span id="s286">They could play fast, they could play sweet, slow, I , I was just ----------.</span> <span id="s287">So, later on when finally I was home, I said to my parents, "I want this," and I mean---------the violin, "I want that, I want this."</span> <span id="s288">After about, I was four years old, as I mentioned, but a year later, when I was five, then finally they gave in since uh every single day I was pestering them for, for that violin, and I start formally taking lessons.</span> <span id="s289">When I was ten I gave a concert, it was my first debut, uh in --------------.</span> <span id="s290">And, when I was 13, I finished conservatory, which the diploma is right there, so it seems like my uh career was really well-established to go on tour, and uh, something high???</span> <span id="s291">However, a man named Hitler, thought it differently.</span> <span id="s292">Now, here I am in Dachau, and I was just praying God, "If you're not going to help me, I'm not going to survive."</span> <span id="s293">And at night, one night thereafter, an SS came to the barrack holding a violin up, and saying, announcing, "Who can play the violin to come to the front room, and if I like you the playing, I'm going to give food and water."</span> <span id="s294">When you mentioned food, we would do anything, and water, I mean anything.</span> <span id="s295">We couldn't think, talk, we dreamt about food.</span> <span id="s296">Nothing I could uh we had but food, food, food.</span> <span id="s297">So hungry.</span> <span id="s298">So, I eagerly volunteered, and so did two others.</span> <span id="s299">So we went to the front room where three Kapos, the SS and the barrack doctor were waiting.</span> <span id="s300">The violin was handed to the older one, it's about a 40 years old man, who tuned it, and the first few notes were shaky because he hadn't played the violin uh about a year or so like myself, but thereafter, he started to play the Zircon, Da Zarcon?</span> <span id="s301">One of the Sonatas.</span> <span id="s302">So beautiful, I had never heard anything like that in my life, and I thought what am I doing here?</span> <span id="s303">I mean this is, the man is going to get the food.</span> <span id="s304">The SS grimaced.</span> <span id="s305">He didn't like it, and signaled the Kapo.</span> <span id="s306">One Kapo went, took the violin away from this wonderful violinist.</span> <span id="s307">The other one picked up an iron pipe and went behind this wonderful man, and he hit him so hard, that he cracked his skull open.</span> <span id="s308">Blood and brain was splattered all over the floor.</span> <span id="s309">I got terribly scared.</span> <span id="s310">I’ve seen death around me but never nothing like that, and immediately I realized like in the past, they don't want really playing, they did not want that violin music, they just the way, that's a joke.</span> <span id="s311">Now we kill another one, and we having fun by that.</span> <span id="s312">So now the violin was handed to the next man who was about 25, and he was so scared that he couldn't play a straight note.</span> <span id="s313">He was standing there shivering, and, and, and, and (plays quivering violin simultaneously) just going like that.</span> <span id="s314">I never found out if he could or could not play.</span> <span id="s315">Well the SS was terribly angry.</span> <span id="s316">He says, "You said, you come out, how do you dare come out, and say that you can play?</span> <span id="s317">And you expect me to give you food for this?"</span> <span id="s318">They started kicking him and, and they were beating him to death.</span> <span id="s319">Now was my turn.</span> <span id="s320">When I came out of the barrack, I was intending if I have a chance to play, I'm going to play a Sonata by ----------- or one of those encore pieces, beautiful pieces by ---------------, after all, I was classically trained.</span> <span id="s321">But I was scared stiff.</span> <span id="s322">My mind went blank.</span> <span id="s323">When I got to him, I said, "My God, my God, how does the Sonatina start?</span> <span id="s324">How does Fitz ---------piece start?</span> <span id="s325">How does anything start?"</span> <span id="s326">And I noticed that the murder Kapo went for his pipe again.</span> <span id="s327">Was picking up and picked up his pipe and was walking toward me.</span> <span id="s328">Every nerve in my body was concentrating on the blow that I'm going to get killed now.</span> <span id="s329">And I was standing there about maybe few seconds, maybe five maybe ten, motionless, and then, incredibly, my right hand and my left hand started to move in perfect harmony, and this what came out of the violin.</span> <span id="s330">Plays.</span> <span id="s331">Beautiful -----------.</span> <span id="s332">Everybody looked at the SS, and the, the Kapo with the iron pipe waiting and waiting for the sign, "When shall I hit him?"</span> <span id="s333">And the Kapo was singing and humming the melody, and he was tapping his fingers uh at the at the table which like it was ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, so hitting the rhythm, and said, "Let him live."</span> <span id="s334">So really honestly I got food, but I was so terribly overtaken by what I've noticed, what I've witnessed that I couldn't eat it.</span> <span id="s335">So, but they let me live.</span> <span id="s336">The Kapo picked up his, up his guitar and accompanied me, and that gave the SS an idea.</span> <span id="s337">So, that wasn't the only time that I played for them.</span> <span id="s338">We had to go and entertain the SS.</span> <span id="s339">And after that specific debut which I did in the front room, I could play anything, it was okay.</span> <span id="s340">I could play anything, but when the SS got tired of, of our playing, our Kapo came along and accompanied me on the guitar.</span> <span id="s341">Then they played differently.</span> <span id="s342">He says, this is ---------, this is enough.</span> <span id="s343">So there we have to stand next to a brick wall, all of us, the Kapo also, and they were shooting at us, there was, I have to, I have to say the truth that it was accident shots.</span> <span id="s344">They were missing, they were aiming at uh my head for instance, right between my eyes, aiming, and at the last second, a little move, and the bullet went above my head, or side of me, and sometimes it came so close that I could f--I could feel the wind of the of the bullet.</span> <span id="s345">If somebody didn't, didn't have that they don't know what I'm talking about.</span> <span id="s346">You know?</span> <span id="s347">And every single time almost, was praying, I said, "God please, let him kill me because it's too much, it's just ten, fifteen, shooting at you, and I, at the end, I looked like a, a bloody mess because from the brick uh wall, little brick, chunk of bricks it would sometimes hit me and they would cut me, but he never, never touched a bullet---------------until later.</span> <span id="s348">I have to tell you that, it was very, there was, again, I use the word "debut," in quotation, and that night there was the back doctor, a French man, who heard me and he was drawn to me immediately because he had a son about the same age as I, and was very talented, and studied the violin, but Mengele thought he was too young to live.</span> <span id="s349">Mengele did not pass him in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s350">So, he was also in Auschwitz, and wound up in Dachau like myself, and but not at the same time as I was.</span> <span id="s351">He was already there, that uh doctor.</span> <span id="s352">And uh, he said, "When we're going to get liberated, I take you and you're going, I take you home, and I'm going to make your dream come true, you're going to be a great violinist, I'm going to take care of you, and in fact, you're going to be my son."</span> <span id="s353">We have to reload.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Beep.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">One day the SS came to our barrack and said, "Jews, Poles, Germans, any prisoners, out of the barrack.</span> <span id="s356">And Russians too.</span> <span id="s357">We're going to be evacuated."</span> <span id="s358">The Americans are close and they did not want us to fall in the Americans' hand.</span> <span id="s359">So, the barrack doctor would come and he said, " The barrack doctor is there and he is going to determine who is going to walk, who is able to walk, who will walk."</span> <span id="s360">It's the very famous death march, by the way, "And uh the others going to be put on cattle cars or on the train."</span> <span id="s361">And we're going to be evacuated, we're going to Tyrol.</span> <span id="s362">However, the truth was that we were taken, we were taken into a forest nearby, and the barrack doctor was also brought just to camouflage the whole things so that we're not going to find out really why we've been tak--taken in the forest.</span> <span id="s363">We were taken out of the barrack in fact.</span> <span id="s364">Now, he knew, and he was helping people to get organized would in a horizontal line, and the machine guns were hidden from our, our view ready to fire.</span> <span id="s365">And then all of the sudden he said to me, turned to me, this doctor, he says, "Alex, Alex, run, run!"</span> <span id="s366">And I then realized that it was no evacuation, it is the end.</span> <span id="s367">And I ran right into the forest for cover, and as I was running again chanting the Shamah Israel, uh the Shamah is Declaration of Faith of the Jew, something terribly hot entered my chest.</span> <span id="s368">And then I had difficulty breathing and I fell, and I was on the ground and I saw that blood was going, falling down on my body, and the doctor noticed the same thing, and I did not hear a shot.</span> <span id="s369">In other words, I did not hear the sound of the shot.</span> <span id="s370">I just heard something hit me and, and I was bloody, blood flowing, but I, I did not hear the shot, and then I had difficulty breathing.</span> <span id="s371">The doctor came right, right away ran toward me and he sort of on one knee down on the floor and took my pulse and, and SS guard was running right behind him with drawn revolver aiming to my head, and the this wonderful French doctor sort of turned back to him and he says, "Don't shoot.</span> <span id="s372">Trois minutes--kaput.</span> <span id="s373">Don't shoot, in three minutes he'll be dead."</span> <span id="s374">So the SS turned to the doctor and says, "Let this dirty Jewish dog suffer for 3 minutes because he's not worth the cost of another bullet.</span> <span id="s375">So he went and signaled another one of his compatriots, and they started the shooting.</span> <span id="s376">And the machine guns, that day, were something like 17,000 killed.</span> <span id="s377">Machine gun.</span> <span id="s378">Of course, they started the day before I'm sure, or or two, but we didn't know about it, and when uh, the trucks came, and the bodies were thrown on the truck and carried back to the camp, uh to, to be uh cremated or thrown in the ditch.</span> <span id="s379">The doctor gave order that the, his French prisoners were the one who have, no they were the Zonder Commando, and he told them that when they take the, pick me up and put ‘em on the, throw me on the top of the bodies.</span> <span id="s380">And I don't know anything about it, I was unconscious, but you can see how many death or dead bodies were among them because I was just wounded.</span> <span id="s381">Mortally wounded, but I wounded, I was not dead.</span> <span id="s382">Meanwhile, we were supposed to be thrown in the ditch or be cremated, but as I said, he, when we arrived in the back to the uh to the uh camp, they took me off of these bodies, and took me into a French barrack, and then he changed the insignia of a Jew to a Frenchman, to a French origin.</span> <span id="s383">He had tweezer or pocket knife.</span> <span id="s384">He fished the bullet out of my chest without any anesthetic, and next day, a wonderful Americans liberated Dachau, and the first thing what we did, they were uh, with their attention, the American's attention called on the very sick ones and the mortally wounded ones or wounded ones, and this is how somebody called the attention on me to the Americans, and they took me immediately to a hospital uh in Dachau right away, is there Dachau first, and they attended to me so I was told later that the doctors found very definitely that I will not survive because I had --------------, I had blood poisoning, and I had typhoid fever, among other thing that were, plus being malnutritioned, and frozen feet.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Now I want to ask you a couple of questions.</span> <span id="s386">Can you tell me how much mental or spiritual resistance played a role do you feel in the camps, not just for you but for others around you?</span> <span id="s387">Was it important?</span></p> <p><span id="s388">I would say spiritual, my uh, uh, my opinion about it, did not play a lot of role because once we got in and we were coming down, lower, uh lower than animal, there was no more, no more any spiritual uh, most people did not believe anymore in God, and the very, very religious ones like my father uh who did, and there were not that many who really believed.</span> <span id="s389">In other words, it was not, you could say that the spiritual uh feelings what dominated uh the camp, not at all, this is my f-findings and my opinion.</span> <span id="s390">In fact, so much so that a lot of people went or wanted to commit suicide by ------------.</span> <span id="s391">And the only reason they could not do that because of the mass suicide happened at Auschwitz, then later at Dachau which I experienced, were stopped by the SS, in a very stupid way, may I say it since they said, "If anybody comes three feet near to the barbed wire, they're gonna shoot him."</span> <span id="s392">I mean this is almost ridiculous because this is what you wanted, except you didn't wanted to, to die with blood flowing but you just touch it and then electrocuted.</span> <span id="s393">It's a better way than being shot to death.</span> <span id="s394">And really honestly, it happened even if you just accidentally got three feet or, or a little bit beyond that the, the SS from there, from their tower, would always the machine gun was aimed out into, into the camp, they would shoot you so that the mass suicide stopped, but not because uh they were spiritual and, and they believed in, in something that they should have believed in, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">What about other physical resistance other than the sand in the rockets?</span> <span id="s396">Were there other times where you know of sabotage?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Uh, there were I'm sure uh many, now for instance we found out that the, the lager fuehrer which means the uh the elder, there was one who is equivalent to the kapo, but he was already there for God knows how many years, and he was made by the SS, the head of the entire barrack.</span> <span id="s398">One person, the head of the entire barrack then the one that we had as I understood, he was a double agent.</span> <span id="s399">A spy for the Americans, and, and secretly he was sending messages.</span> <span id="s400">Now I found that one out, out after liberation.</span> <span id="s401">However this one interesting uh note about Dachau, in spite of all that it was my experience being shot and all this, I don't know 17,000 something killed, and there were still several thousand left in the camp, which the Dachau, the camp Dachau was mined.</span> <span id="s402">Nobody knew that.</span> <span id="s403">And the only reason that the Americans liberated Dachau when they did instead of doing it two or three days later because again an SS uh Guard or Officer, who was also a double agent, through the darkness during the night, went over the, the American line and throw that next very next day and I don't know the hour, the very next day, the entire Dachau is going to be mined, it was blown up.</span> <span id="s404">And not one of the prisoners is going to stay alive.</span> <span id="s405">So, the Americans came before that could have happened.</span> <span id="s406">Saved many, many lives.</span> <span id="s407">That was not known to many, and I cannot tell you, not because it's a secret, and I cannot tell you just how I found out, but I found out from a source, which very reliable.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">We have to reload.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Beep.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">I want to ask you about support systems.</span> <span id="s411">You had a family for a long time with you that helped you in the camps.</span> <span id="s412">Did you see a lot of other people who had friends who helped them or, or did you see the opposite?</span> <span id="s413">Was there, were ethics abandoned?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">What, you talking about a family meaning my brother and, and…</span></p> <p><span id="s415">And your father.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Yeah.</span> <span id="s417">Okay, I'll answer truthfully.</span> <span id="s418">There was a lot, very unfortunate what I seen in the camp among prisoners.</span> <span id="s419">They were instances when instead of some giving present as we did to our father, and giving up a piece of bread, which was, that was your ration, and we're talking about a piece of bread, I'm talking about it, was a little bit of size you know.</span> <span id="s420">Uh, they were stealing from each other, and there were unfortunately uh sons who turned against father or father against son, so that they can survive.</span> <span id="s421">At that point, not everybody, but I have seen quite a few, that they turned against each other and they were really, as I mentioned earlier, they were animal, they became animalistic.</span> <span id="s422">It was incredible.</span> <span id="s423">No matter how low we got, meaning me, uh and my, my brother plus of course father, and also others, they would not do that, and I have seen it done, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">I want you to tell me about age again.</span> <span id="s425">I want you to tell me how there was a selection in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s426">Who was selected as if I don't know anything about it.</span> <span id="s427">And I want you to do the story of you coming up in the line with Mengele, again as though you haven't told me before, just do it fresh again.</span> <span id="s428">So maybe you want to do the whole selection of your family again just coming off the train.</span> <span id="s429">Give a good picture of how the selection was done.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Well, when we, when we uh, the doors were opened and we had, we were ordered out, then, as I mentioned earlier, head prisoners called Kapos which were rushing toward us, and start hitting, kicking, beating, and the SS would hit us ----------faster, and stand in line, man in one, and women and small children in the other.</span> <span id="s431">And, after we lined up, I noticed a high-ranking SS officer, in fact, what I noticed he was a having a monocle and peering through that at us, peering at us with this monocle, and that was the infamous Dr. Josef Mengele.</span> <span id="s432">The Angel of Death, so-called Angel of Death, who decided our fate.</span> <span id="s433">Either you get immediately to the gas chamber or you had to stay and, and, and feel the pain of being alive.</span> <span id="s434">It was uh lingering torture --------------.</span> <span id="s435">And as I mentioned also that he had a stick in his hand which I identified as a baton, and he was like a conductor, conducting the people that they had to file by and, to the right and to the left.</span> <span id="s436">First was, first were in our family, my mother and uh younger sister, Goldie, her real name in Hungarian was Oronco.</span> <span id="s437">And they were sent to one side, to the left.</span> <span id="s438">Violet was the next.</span> <span id="s439">She was 18.</span> <span id="s440">Oronco was 9.</span> <span id="s441">She was sent to the opposite side to the right.</span> <span id="s442">That was followed by Zolton, and of course my father and Zolton, they were also sent to the same side as Violet, whose real name in Hungarian is Iboya, which means Viollet if you translate it into English.</span> <span id="s443">Then came my turn, and as I was, I was walking, was almost by Mengele when he gestured to me to stop, and then turn to me, very sweet voice, like a father, "Tell me, little boy, how old are you?"</span> <span id="s444">I said, "I'm 16, and I have the proof."</span> <span id="s445">And he looked at me, I'm sure he didn't believe me.</span> <span id="s446">In fact he had a sneer, sort of a smile on his face, which later I identified or at least uh saying that maybe he said to himself, "You're going to be sorry that you lied to me because death in a gas chamber will be easier than what you're going to go through," but nevertheless, he did motion me toward the group where my he ----------- my father and brother.</span> <span id="s447">When the selections were over, my mother, my younger sister and the group they were in, they were led away.</span> <span id="s448">That was a time that I didn't know that I will never, never see them again.</span> <span id="s449">They were, were taken directly to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s450">They were actually taken to a, as I mentioned, there was building which, building there that lettering, 'Bade', Bath.</span> <span id="s451">And then, then they were issued a towel and a bar of soap, and telling...</span></p> <p><span id="s452">That's, we got that part before.</span> <span id="s453">When you think back on all those things, tell me the things you remember from your senses.</span> <span id="s454">Sounds or smells or things like that that you that stick out in your memory.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Believe it or not, here sometimes, when I go by where, where the building streets, and those are the that category of , what do you call this in English by that, it's, it's, it's tar I think, they're laying the tar down, the smell of the tar brings back awful memories to me because those tars we were working on building also roads.</span> <span id="s456">Certain sounds, if you want me to uh tell you what kind of a sound, sometimes, I don't even realize why all of the sudden I just feel that I am, I am cornered, I am like the animals, it's, it's no, no way out, and then I realize that that's something triggered ------------in me, that what I saw in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s457">And the worst thing probably is the occasional dreams that that my family appears and not in a favorable position.</span> <span id="s458">I see picking up my mother, although I did not pick up my mother, but picking up my mother and my little sister and putting on the cart, and carting to the crematorium, and I would like you to know that I never never, never spoken to anyone about this, I I'm speaking about that.</span> <span id="s459">Do you know why I'm speaking about this now?</span> <span id="s460">Because, I believe there's so many things that one locked in.</span> <span id="s461">Maybe if I speak about it, I will be cured of these reoccurring dreams.</span> <span id="s462">And lately thank God, it's not coming back that often as they used to, but it still does and then Sherry, who is sleeps right next to me, goes, she will wake me up, and she knows, she does not ask me, "What kind of a dream did you have?"</span> <span id="s463">She just wakes me up and she knows.</span> <span id="s464">It was a bad dream going back to Auschwitz and Dachau.</span> <span id="s465">Actually I was in four camps.</span> <span id="s466">Started with Auschwitz, France, Copendorf, and now, then Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">People like to believe in humankind, and to believe in heroism.</span> <span id="s468">How do you feel about that after what you lived through?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Well, I will tell you one thing.</span> <span id="s470">I have to, of course, it's very personal.</span> <span id="s471">When I arrived and I uh, to Cleveland as I mentioned and got to go with this uh, uh --------------.</span> <span id="s472">He finding out what I have done was certainly not short of heroism, that what I was filling sands in capsules that I, that I know, which I already told you, there was ten, however since then, accidentally, one in a million again, I found another fighter pilot who was saved, who was shot by one of these shells, one of these rockets and escaped certain death.</span> <span id="s473">But, he this Bank Director wanted to make me into a hero.</span> <span id="s474">He wanted to get the newspapers, in fact, the only thing what I accepted was an invitation to his son to meet personally, and his family, and we had a dinner, but he wanted to alert the newspapers and all this, I said, "No.</span> <span id="s475">I did not do it for being a hero, for heroism, uh to take advantage of, maybe my career would go faster.</span> <span id="s476">I believe in something, and I was ready to give my life for that."</span> <span id="s477">We have to reload.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Changing film, Camera roll 8 is going up; Sync take 10 is up.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Beep.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Okay, so tell me why you risked your life and committed sabotage.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Well, all honestly, I didn't believe that we would ever get out of there.</span> <span id="s482">Down deep in my subconscious, maybe, I was hoping yes.</span> <span id="s483">Believe, no.</span> <span id="s484">And when he said, "Will you give up your life?"</span> <span id="s485">that that really meant for me that I'm going to die because I didn't believe that we could get away with it, but since it wasn't only that conversation between me and the this captain, the French captain.</span> <span id="s486">It were much more that we talked, not uh we couldn't sit talk uh like I'm talking to you because there were SS guards around it, and they would not like prisoners to converse.</span> <span id="s487">However, here and there we would, uh we could say a few words to each other.</span> <span id="s488">Uh, I really did not believe and I thought, if that helps, if just one person helps then Hitler did not uh get what he really wanted, to, to annihilate all the Jews, to kill all the Jews, or destroy the world.</span> <span id="s489">I was taken from home, a beautiful home, meaning home life, not as a building I'm speaking of.</span> <span id="s490">Very orthodox family.</span> <span id="s491">Very close-knit family.</span> <span id="s492">And, what I have seen over there and going to, I figured sooner or later I must meet my death because I just couldn’t go on dodging the, the bullets so to speak ---------------.</span> <span id="s493">I was not picked and there I was not picked, and then one, one of these picking and innocently, the people that they were around that managed the ammunition factory were taken at random.</span> <span id="s494">It was 30 people, they were not saboteurs at all.</span> <span id="s495">I was a saboteur, the captain was saboteur, and somebody else saboteur, and another thing, but they were not bad.</span> <span id="s496">If they were around anyone in the uh in Copendorf, which was the Salt Mine in Yom Kippur, I didn't cut the wire.</span> <span id="s497">It's only one man did it, but he was from our group.</span> <span id="s498">Half of these people were picked and shot to death, and the other half were beaten or, or almost to death, you know, so, how could I, how could I believe that I would be surviving.</span> <span id="s499">In spite of all the with my father who was a very strong force, and I still feel his even, even beyond the grave, believe it or not, I still feel his, his force on me, but he told me, I still trying, and I wish to God I could be half what he was, but at least started to fashion my life according what he, how he lived.</span> <span id="s500">Of course, I'm not speaking of keeping kosher, which we're not, but all the other decent and good things what he did, and there was one decent thing to do: sabotage.</span> <span id="s501">If and when the occasion arise, arose, and then it did.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Tell me about the Symphony of the Holocaust, tell me about the pieces you're going to play.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Well, the, I must uh very briefly say that uh, the Symphony of the Holocaust, the melodies came to me while in, in Con-Concentration Camp, and here is another thing that probably helped survive bes-beside God's will.</span> <span id="s504">Because when I got, they had this, this -------------, that terrible ------------, that I was about to touch the uh barbed wire, I would say to myself first, "Why don't you, why don't you just "play," (in quotation) meaning play, goes through in your head.</span> <span id="s505">Why don't you just play that movement which you just learned from before you were taken Mendelson's Violin Concerto.</span> <span id="s506">Let's see if you can rem-remember.</span> <span id="s507">That gave me strength.</span> <span id="s508">I went through while I was hitting the with, with the hammer or I was uh lifting the heavy uh things which I, I really couldn't lift, but I lift it because there is a world to lift you know that stone, the salt stone.</span> <span id="s509">Some of them they were dynamiting, you know, and they were not telling us in time, so they killed many, many of us.</span> <span id="s510">But anyway, so that gave me also an incentive to live, so this is how it started, and then another concentration camp, which where I went, different melodies came to me.</span> <span id="s511">I couldn't write it down, but it came over and over and over, and when I had a chance I wrote it down, but only about 5 or 6 years ago that I completed it in a form of a symphony, and of course, I will play some excerpt for it, from it, but, in all honesty, what I am saying, all those pain, all the sufferings, I wrote it on the symphony in such a way as certain instruments, like the flute or the clarinet or bassoon, and the violas and the violins, that they talking, they telling the story, the instruments telling the story, but in this case we still will play just a little excepts from here and there.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Tell me about the three movements.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Actually there is five movements, uh, the first one is entitled, 'The Song of the Holocaust,' the second one is the prayer where we turn to God to liberate us from that terrible, terrible ordeal, and the third one is 'The Song of Liberation,' which is rhythmical.</span> <span id="s514">When we finally saw the soldiers coming in, whoever could form a circle, start to dance a certain you know style or aura????</span> <span id="s515">Then when we realized that even though we survived that our loved ones were gone and we went to the to the ditch looking to the grave, see if we, if we recognize some of them.</span> <span id="s516">At least we know what happened.</span> <span id="s517">And that's 'The Song of Commemoration.'</span> <span id="s518">It's a slow rhythmical song, but life goes on and then we realize that our lives were given back, a new beginning, that we're alive, and we're happy so we felt as free as a bird, and this is the joy of life and freedom and, and one point in that song toward the end in a Credenza, to, for the violin of course, I imitating a bird, for a short, just a few bars, but I'm imitating a bird to express the joy and the freedom.</span> <span id="s519">So that's the fifth movement.</span> <span id="s520">But they all are short.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Let's cut.</span> <span id="s522">The following is 30 seconds of room tone for interview with Shony
