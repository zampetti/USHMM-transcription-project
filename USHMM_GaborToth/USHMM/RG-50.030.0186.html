Uh, welcome.</span> <span id="s12">And would you tell me your name, please?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A: My name is Liane Reif-Lehrer.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q: And where and when were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: I was born in Vienna, Austria, Zweitebitziek, on November 14th, 1934.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: Uh, tell me about your parents.</span> <span id="s17">Uh, what did your father do?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: Uh, my father was born in Poland, and came to Vienna to go to medical school.</span> <span id="s19">And then uh went on, after he finished medical school, to study dentistry; and then opened a dental practice uh in Vienna.</span> <span id="s20">Uh, my mother was also born in Poland; and came to Vienna, I think, probably for some frivolous reason--like a vacation, or to buy clothes or something like that.</span> <span id="s21">And somehow met my father.</span> <span id="s22">Uh, and they were married; and uh my mother stayed in Vienna.</span> <span id="s23">And uh they uh...I guess things were a little bit rough at first, getting my father's practice off the ground.</span> <span id="s24">And I think during those early years my mother helped out-- answering the phone and...and things like that.</span> <span id="s25">But then after that, she really did not work as long as we were still in Europe.</span> <span id="s26">And my father had a rather thriving practice, uh which was inside our house.</span> <span id="s27">There were two apartments that ...and they had the wall broken down between them.</span> <span id="s28">So that basically we had this... I guess there were fourteen rooms on one level.</span> <span id="s29">At one end was my father's practice, and the other end were our living quarters.</span> <span id="s30">Uh, so I guess it...it was fairly thriving.</span> <span id="s31">And I think there was a fair amount of uh...oh, social activity--in the sense of going to the opera, and uh... I don't know.</span> <span id="s32">Maybe some theater.</span> <span id="s33">And uh I think once a week they went to some relatives' and played cards.</span> <span id="s34">And uh, you know, probably the usual kind of thing that any middle-class family in that era would have been doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: Uh, what about your...your very uh early years?</span> <span id="s36">Uh, you were born in '34.</span> <span id="s37">What do you remember of your very early childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: Well, my memories are very spotty.</span> <span id="s39">Uh, but uh...I remember ...I remember my father's office, and I remember my own room and I remember parts of the layout of the apartment quite well.</span> <span id="s40">Not all of it.</span> <span id="s41">I mean, I don't think I could draw you a map.</span> <span id="s42">But I uh...I remember the dining room, for example; and I remember the kitchen.</span> <span id="s43">Uh, I think I liked messing around in the kitchen a lot.</span> <span id="s44">And I liked... We had a cook, and she let me uh play around in there and do things; although I seem to remember my mother didn't like me to do that.</span> <span id="s45">Uh ,the cook used to let me stand up on a chair and help dry the dishes; and I..</span> <span id="s46">.</span> <span id="s47">I think my mother was not too thrilled about that.</span> <span id="s48">Uh, one of the fun things that I remember is inter-act... We...there were other uh... I hate to use this word, but "servants," in the house.</span> <span id="s49">I mean, people who cleaned and uh scrubbed laundry and did all those things; and I think they were sort of fun for me.</span> <span id="s50">And I remember a fair number of...of things.</span> <span id="s51">Like when they uh ...they used to roll up the carpets and the runners and take them up to--I don't know, the roof maybe--to beat them with those old-fashioned paddles.</span> <span id="s52">And when they rolled up... Especially there were long hallways in the apartment.</span> <span id="s53">So we had these long runners, and they would let me stand or sit on one end; and as they rolled it up and kept pulling it, I got a ride.</span> <span id="s54">Uh, and then when they folded the laundry, I remember getting a ride; you know, getting swung in the sheets.</span> <span id="s55">Uh, and I remember getting rides on brooms.</span> <span id="s56">You know, I'd put my feet on the two parts of the broom and they would sweep along.</span> <span id="s57">Uh, so I remember that.</span> <span id="s58">I..</span> <span id="s59">.</span> <span id="s60">I remember ...uh I remember one of my governesses; uh, and I think she slept in my room, actually.</span> <span id="s61">I think in my room there was my uh sort of crib and...and maybe... I only remember that there was a crib, although as I look back on it by the age four it's hard to believe that I still slept in a crib.</span> <span id="s62">But who knows?</span> <span id="s63">And then right in...in uh line with that, there was this other bed where I think the governess slept.</span> <span id="s64">Uh, and I remember quite well the layout of my room and where there was a dresser, and I think there was a furry animal, and...and where the window was.</span> <span id="s65">Uh, I'm not sure I remember terribly much else about those early uh years.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: What about people?</span> <span id="s67">What about your parents?</span> <span id="s68">What do you remember about them?</span> <span id="s69">What do you remember about...?</span> <span id="s70">I believe you had a brother.</span> <span id="s71">Tell me about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: Uh, I don't...I don't really think I remember very much from the Vienna era about people.</span> <span id="s73">Uh, actually it's very bothersome that I uh...I think I remembered my father when I was younger.</span> <span id="s74">But then, at some stage when I was probably ten or eleven, uh and of course we were already in the United States long since by that time.</span> <span id="s75">But my mother always had a large picture of my father on her bed, uh her night table; and I remember a day when I looked at that picture and suddenly realized that the actual memory of my father that I remembered having then had been replaced by the memory of this photograph.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s77">Let's get a sense of...of... You described a child having a good time in the house.</span> <span id="s78">Uh, as the Hitler years progressed and we move toward the years uh of uh...to the Anschluss, uh can you tell me what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: Uh, the only thing that I can tell you about from my first-hand recollection is about Kristallnacht, because I remember that with incredible clarity.</span> <span id="s80">Uh, my mother was holding me in her arms, and my brother was holding onto her skirt.</span> <span id="s81">Uh, and there was this knock at the door.</span> <span id="s82">And uh I re...I mean, I remember that it was a very tense time and it was in the evening.</span> <span id="s83">And uh my mother went to... We had one of these peepholes that has like a metal cover, you know, that you push aside; and my mother pushed it aside, and somebody whammed the back of a revolver and broke the glass.</span> <span id="s84">And then the superintendent called out, "Don't worry for life.</span> <span id="s85">It's just me; let us in."</span> <span id="s86">I thought two men came in, but my brother tells me actually were five or six.</span> <span id="s87">Uh and then, I mean, they were very unpleasant.</span> <span id="s88">And uh I think they kind of totally ignored all three of us, actually.</span> <span id="s89">They kind of rummaged through the house.</span> <span id="s90">And I..</span> <span id="s91">.</span> <span id="s92">and I..</span> <span id="s93">.</span> <span id="s94">they took a lot of things; but the only thing that I specifically remember them taking is that the cook... There was a white closet in the kitchen where they kept uh, you know, like towels and kitchen-related things.</span> <span id="s95">And...and there was a uh...a tall can from these things called "pastilles," which came in either a one-tier or a three-tier kind.</span> <span id="s96">And this was the three-tier kind; and the cook used to save coins in it, groschen--which are sort of like pennies.</span> <span id="s97">And that must have been important to me, because I remember that they took that.</span> <span id="s98">And I was not disturbed...I don't remember being disturbed about them taking anything else.</span> <span id="s99">But I remember being disturbed about them taking that.</span> <span id="s100">And uh...so that evening is sort of like a frozen still photograph in my mind.</span> <span id="s101">But I..</span> <span id="s102">.</span> <span id="s103">you know, then it blacks out on either side of that.</span> <span id="s104">Uh, and one of the things that I just recently uh said to my brother--who has often asked me, you know, "Why do you think backwards instead of living your life forwards?"</span> <span id="s105">Uh, and I..</span> <span id="s106">.</span> <span id="s107">I mean, that's a hard question to answer.</span> <span id="s108">But about a year ago, when he asked me that, after we hung up the phone I sat down to write him a letter.</span> <span id="s109">I suddenly realized that I guess...I guess for him, because he has a continual memory of that era, it's perhaps a little easier.</span> <span id="s110">I mean, he sort of remembers what happened and then what happened and then what happened.</span> <span id="s111">And for me, I said to him, I feel as though there's kind of a black box there that I'm maybe constantly trying to pry open but I can't get it open.</span> <span id="s112">And uh I guess when I went to the reunion in June uh of the St. Louis survivors, I somehow...I suppose I was subconsciously or maybe more than subconsciously hoping that some person or some conversation or something there would just trigger something that would help to...to remind me of... But I..</span> <span id="s113">.</span> <span id="s114">I can't get it back.</span> <span id="s115">And uh...uh I mean, my mother used to tell me a lot about how...how much my father wanted a daughter and how fond he was of me, and...and so on.</span> <span id="s116">And I sort of would like to try to go back and remember what that relationship might have been like, but I can't.</span> <span id="s117">I can't bring it back.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: Alright.</span> <span id="s119">You've moved to your father.</span> <span id="s120">And let's talk about what happened, as it were, on either side of Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s121">You had started...your parents had started looking for papers to come to America, or a way to come to America?</span> <span id="s122">What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: Uh, my father uh... And I can't seem to get straight information from anybody; but my father was one of uh quite a few children.</span> <span id="s124">And some people say five, some people say seven, some people say nine.</span> <span id="s125">I don't know.</span> <span id="s126">I have a feeling it was either seven or nine.</span> <span id="s127">Uh, and there actually was a set of twins in the family.</span> <span id="s128">But, anyway, two of the siblings had come to America, uh I think maybe as early as 1920's.</span> <span id="s129">And there had been some talk in the family, apparently, of coming to America to join them.</span> <span id="s130">Uh, and I think as things got worse, that talk got more.</span> <span id="s131">Uh, but apparently my father's feeling was, you know, "Look, I'm forty years old.</span> <span id="s132">I don't know English.</span> <span id="s133">Uh, I wouldn't be able to practice dentistry or medicine in America without extensive re-training.</span> <span id="s134">How can I..</span> <span id="s135">.</span> <span id="s136">?</span> <span id="s137">And, you know, I have such a good practice here.</span> <span id="s138">How can I just get up and go?"</span> <span id="s139">Uh, well, my father never made it to Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s140">Uh, but anyway, they realized I think fairly late that they really had to leave.</span> <span id="s141">And so, uh on the morning of September 30th, 1938, my mother and father left the house in the morning to do a number of chores.</span> <span id="s142">And one of the chores was to pick up our passports, which they did.</span> <span id="s143">Uh, and then I guess at around lunchtime, they parted to do some separate things; and they were supposed to meet, I think, either at home or at the home of this cousin where they sometimes played cards.</span> <span id="s144">But anyway, they were supposed to meet in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s145">And my father never came back.</span> <span id="s146">And he was found dead at the bottom of a uh...a four-story stairwell.</span> <span id="s147">And the story over the years has been that he had been getting increasingly depressed--especially because in August he had to close his practice and he was no longer allowed to to work.</span> <span id="s148">Uh, and a lot of people were committing suicide.</span> <span id="s149">And so I kind of grew up with uh...I mean, a very strange thing.</span> <span id="s150">I mean, it was kind of talked about, that he had committed suicide.</span> <span id="s151">Uh, but uh...my mo..</span> <span id="s152">.</span> <span id="s153">my mother was very, very sensitive about that; and she...she was very adamant that I never tell anybody about that.</span> <span id="s154">And I think, really, that must have been a a very difficult thing for me as I was growing up.</span> <span id="s155">But anyway, you know, I didn't really think about it very much uh either.</span> <span id="s156">As an adult now, as I look back and I ask people, "Well, how...?"</span> <span id="s157">You know, and I hear from other survivors about the horrible things that were being done to people, my question has been: "How do you know that he jumped?"</span> <span id="s158">And, well, you know, and they say, "Well, we don't know that he jumped.</span> <span id="s159">But he was very depressed, and a lot of people were committing suicide."</span> <span id="s160">And uh...and my brother also provides a very rational uh reason, which is that he probably thought that the family would be better off without a male.</span> <span id="s161">Uh, and so it seems likely that...that he did this.</span> <span id="s162">But I can't help always wondering, with all the other stories I hear about, could somebody have pushed him?</span> <span id="s163">I mean, nobody would know the difference.</span> <span id="s164">So I don't know what the answer to that is.</span> <span id="s165">But, anyway, he never came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s167">So you and your mother now were left--this is at the end of September 1938--uh without a father and husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: And by the way, those passports that my mother got that morning were taken on Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s169">So...</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s171">So we move from September to November.</span> <span id="s172">Kristallnacht happens.</span> <span id="s173">You are without passports.</span> <span id="s174">What did your mother do?</span> <span id="s175">What did you do?</span> <span id="s176">All of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: Uh, I think there was a lot of scurry to try to get some new passports, uh which we ultimately did.</span> <span id="s178">I think there was probably a lot of correspondence with the Klinghoffer family, which was my father's sister in New York.</span> <span id="s179">Uh, and at some point--and I don't remember when this was, but I think I actually remember this happening--this enormous van came to the house.</span> <span id="s180">And my...my mother was really in, I think she was in really bad straights after my father's death.</span> <span id="s181">Uh, and this friend of ours who was a lawyer came and kind of supervised, I think, the packing of this van.</span> <span id="s182">Uh, and I don't remember what went into it; but I do remember what came out of it at the other end.</span> <span id="s183">And it was ... (Laughter) I mean, it was just a ridiculous assortment of some useful but many totally useless uh objects.</span> <span id="s184">But anyway, this van was packed, I suppose, without much thought and in a lot of hurry and sent off to New York; and it was in storage for three years until we finally came there.</span> <span id="s185">Uh, so I..</span> <span id="s186">.</span> <span id="s187">I do think I remember the day the van was being packed.</span> <span id="s188">But then again, there is...</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: What did you do?</span> <span id="s190">The van was packed; and then what did you and your mother do, specifically?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: Well, somehow uh there was this...there was news, I guess, of this ship that was leaving from Hamburg, this St. Louis--or the St. Louis, as they call it here.</span> <span id="s192">Uh, and because people were not allowed to take money out of the country--I think you were allowed four or ten dollars per person--uh I think we and a lot of people like us, who might not have bought first class tickets, uh bought first class tickets.</span> <span id="s193">Because you couldn't take the money anyway, so you might as well, you know, spend it on this.</span> <span id="s194">Uh, and so we...we got these tickets and we got these visas, uh which also cost a fair amount of money.</span> <span id="s195">Uh, and on...in early May of 1939, we took a train to Hamburg uh to get on this boat.</span> <span id="s196">Now, I don't remember anything about the voyage except, I think, I remember two things.</span> <span id="s197">One is that there's kind of a sense of fear that I still have whenever I have to uh go through any kind of checkpoints.</span> <span id="s198">And I think that part of that must have started at that time.</span> <span id="s199">And from what my brother tells me it was very scary in Hamburg, because you didn't know, you know, were you going to get on?</span> <span id="s200">Was something going to happen before you get on got on?</span> <span id="s201">And so on.</span> <span id="s202">Uh, and the other thing is that I remember and still have a little white sun-suit uh that I that I was wearing on the ship; and I just happen to remember--again, it's like a still photograph of me in this little uh white sun-suit with little shorts and discreet cover-ups on the...in the chest region.</span> <span id="s203">(Laughter) Uh, and then I don't remember anything else from from the ship.</span> <span id="s204">But uh...I mean, I know that the ship, of course, came to Cuba and we were not allowed in.</span> <span id="s205">Uh, and my brother tells me that uh this lawyer, whose name was [Kleinfeld (ph)], uh actually had already been in Cuba at that the time that the boat docked.</span> <span id="s206">And he rode out on a little boat to come and see us.</span> <span id="s207">Uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: Who was the lawyer?</span> <span id="s209">Was he a connection with you personally, or with your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: Well, we were quite friendly with them then when we came to the United States.</span> <span id="s211">But I think we were friends...I'm not sure that our parents were such good friends.</span> <span id="s212">I have a feeling that the friendship might have come about through the friendship between their son and my brother, but I'm not sure about that.</span> <span id="s213">But they certainly figured in our lives.</span> <span id="s214">I mean, I..</span> <span id="s215">.</span> <span id="s216">I remem...they were always talked about.</span> <span id="s217">Uh, so he came to the ship, to...to see us, apparently; and then, I mean, what--(coughing) excuse me--what happened on the ship is...is of course well-known, historically.</span> <span id="s218">And the ship was turned back, and we went to France.</span> <span id="s219">And that's when I start to have much more coherent memories.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: Tell us what happened when the ship docked.</span> <span id="s221">What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: You mean, when we got back to France?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: When you got back to France, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: Uh, well, we ended up first at uh a little town in uh centrally...central France called Loudun.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: How did you get there?</span> <span id="s226">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: I don't remember getting to Loudun.</span> <span id="s228">But uh in Loudun, we were put up in this hotel.</span> <span id="s229">And I guess there must have been a group of about twenty of us from the St. Louis.</span> <span id="s230">Uh, and I remember this hotel, and I remember this...what I thought was a very, very large square in front of the hotel.</span> <span id="s231">But in my adult life--when I went back in 1978, I think it was, to Loudun--the square didn't look nearly as large as I remembered it.</span> <span id="s232">(Laughter) Uh, uh the things I remember from the hotel in Loudun: uh, I remember where our room was--it was a little room on the side.</span> <span id="s233">And uh...and I remember some fairly dramatic things.</span> <span id="s234">I remember having this little so-called boyfriend that I guess I played with.</span> <span id="s235">Uh... What I remember much more dramatically are two things.</span> <span id="s236">Uh, well, first off, there are some trivial things I remember.</span> <span id="s237">I remember my mother was always very neat and clean.</span> <span id="s238">Uh, and I remember that my mother was really horrified at the lack of cleanliness in this hotel, and that there were cats running around on the food preparation tables.</span> <span id="s239">Uh, and I also remember that she was absolutely horrified because there was no place to bathe or shower in the hotel.</span> <span id="s240">There were toilets, but no, you know, bathing rooms.</span> <span id="s241">And so my mother apparently asked the woman who ran the hotel where the town bathing facilities were; and the woman apparently didn't know.</span> <span id="s242">And my mother was totally horrified by that.</span> <span id="s243">And uh, oh, for years later my mother always did talk about "You don't know how much perfume this lady wore," and so on.</span> <span id="s244">So I remember trivia like that, and I remember somehow running around.</span> <span id="s245">And I remember uh...I remember once these two older girls sort of held me and made me watch while they were killing uh a chicken that was going to be used for dinner.</span> <span id="s246">And...and that was really...I remember that with great horror.</span> <span id="s247">You know, I didn't want to watch that, and they sort of forced me.</span> <span id="s248">Uh, so I remember that.</span> <span id="s249">But the more dramatic things that I remember is that one morning we woke up and there uh was this incredible commotion outside.</span> <span id="s250">And there were uh shots; and, I mean, I didn't know that they were shots, but that's what they were.</span> <span id="s251">And the Germans had come in to Loudun.</span> <span id="s252">And uh so, for I guess what must have been a couple of weeks we lived in this hotel, and uh a lot of the German soldiers either... I don't know if they also lived there, but they certainly were around all the time and they had meals there.</span> <span id="s253">And one of the things that I remember, to this day, being incredibly puzzled about--because at this point uh I was only about five and a half or so--uh is that I was... First of all, you have to understand I was always a very "good girl," and I always did everything I was told.</span> <span id="s254">Uh, and I was told that under no circumstances was I to let on that I spoke German.</span> <span id="s255">Now, how they expected to perpetuate this hoax I don't know; because my mother spoke no French.</span> <span id="s256">My brother had had French lessons in Vienna, so he probably did have some command of French.</span> <span id="s257">But I was kind of cute as a little girl, and the soldiers would come up and talk to me.</span> <span id="s258">And I remember very clearly continually saying, as they spoke to me in German, "Je ne comprends pas.</span> <span id="s259">Je ne comprends pas."</span> <span id="s260">And I remember also thinking that there was something very funny about, I guess, having always been taught that you're not supposed to lie and here I was being instructed to tell this out-and-out lie.</span> <span id="s261">And also nobody explained to me why I was telling this lie.</span> <span id="s262">And so I was really very perplexed, I think, by this whole thing.</span> <span id="s263">But I did exactly what I was told.</span> <span id="s264">And I remember the soldiers saying all these things to me--which I, of course, understood perfectly--but just saying "Je ne comprends pas."</span> <span id="s265">So that was one thing.</span> <span id="s266">Another thing... Oh, even before that time, there was one other thing I remember.</span> <span id="s267">There was an air raid one night, and I..</span> <span id="s268">.</span> <span id="s269">somehow I..</span> <span id="s270">.</span> <span id="s271">I got away from my mother and I ran outside.</span> <span id="s272">And they had to come and retrieve me.</span> <span id="s273">I somehow thought it was interesting, or fun, or whatever.</span> <span id="s274">Uh, but anyway, uh...so for the two weeks or so that we stayed in this hotel in Loudun, in the morning the Germans would do these...I don't know.</span> <span id="s275">Whatever you call them--you know, maneuvers or something.</span> <span id="s276">They'd march around the hotel in formation, with their big boots and things.</span> <span id="s277">And uh my mother and my brother and I would watch from the window.</span> <span id="s278">And there was one soldier...and I don't remember his face, but I remember, I remember his form.</span> <span id="s279">And I remember that he had sort of wavy sandy-colored hair.</span> <span id="s280">And I..</span> <span id="s281">.</span> <span id="s282">I can't help wondering, in retrospect, maybe he didn't even know I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s283">I mean, or maybe he did.</span> <span id="s284">I don't know.</span> <span id="s285">I always sort of in the past assumed that he knew.</span> <span id="s286">But now I think, "Well, you know, maybe he didn't know."</span> <span id="s287">Who knows?</span> <span id="s288">But he threw me candies uh on a number of occasions.</span> <span id="s289">And my mother was sure they were poisoned, and...but I ate them anyway.</span> <span id="s290">And here I am.</span> <span id="s291">And then, on one of the last days we were there, he brought me a little doll.</span> <span id="s292">And I think that interaction through; I think that interaction very, very strongly colored my life attitudes.</span> <span id="s293">Uh, because I think...I think even then, you know, I somehow must have known that these were the bad guys.</span> <span id="s294">But this guy, who I have a feeling might have been you know eighteen or nineteen, uh was just nice, you know; and he was nice to me.</span> <span id="s295">Uh, and...and maybe I jump to conclusions on very naïve grounds; but several years later, when I came to the United States, and kids would and...and their parents ask me, you know, really ridiculous things to say to a child--like, uh, "How do you like America?"</span> <span id="s296">And, "Do you hate the Germans?"</span> <span id="s297">And I remember always saying, "No, I don't hate the Germans.</span> <span id="s298">There are good Germans, and there are bad Germans."</span> <span id="s299">And I ...I mean maybe this is simplistic, but I've always thought that it really had to do with this one soldier that somehow made me get a..</span> <span id="s300">.</span> <span id="s301">a very sensible attitude, even though I was so young, about the differences between people.</span> <span id="s302">And I've always sort of very fondly remembered that.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s304">So you were in Loudun, uh and you had these these memories.</span> <span id="s305">Uh, how long were you in Loudun?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: Uh, we must have been in Loudun for somewhere between nine months and a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: What is your perception of your mother during that period?</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: I think...I think in retrospect--and I wish I had realized this more when she was still around--my mother must have really, basically, been an incredibly strong person to have gone through that.</span> <span id="s309">Because when I try to think back on it, I often think I..</span> <span id="s310">.</span> <span id="s311">you know, I don't think I could have done the things that she did.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: That's not what I'm asking.</span> <span id="s313">I'm asking what your memory of her...</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: I..</span> <span id="s315">.</span> <span id="s316">I know what you're asking, and I..</span> <span id="s317">.</span> <span id="s318">I really had to give that preamble; because my...my sense of my mother during those years, and...and many years later, is that that she somehow never got it all together except for the practical things.</span> <span id="s319">That she somehow was so...I'm not sure what the right word is, but maybe almost frantic.</span> <span id="s320">I mean, she was... And who knows?</span> <span id="s321">I mean, maybe I would have been the same way.</span> <span id="s322">But I mean, she really...she was in mourning for my father for the rest of her life.</span> <span id="s323">And she only died in 1982 at age, you know, 84.</span> <span id="s324">I guess she was a woman who already had learned something like five languages, but she could not learn French.</span> <span id="s325">You know, it was not just there at that time.</span> <span id="s326">Uh, and I think uh... I wish I could remember the German word that that she used to use a lot.</span> <span id="s327">That she was just uh...she just didn't...she sort of didn't know what to do, you know, with herself or what was going on, and so on.</span> <span id="s328">Uh, and I think the... What she had always told me was that after the Germans came into Loudun, that my brother--who was uh about thirteen at that time, I guess, uh or twelve or thirteen--said one day that he was not staying in Loudun, and that whether she left or not he was leaving.</span> <span id="s329">Now, I'm not sure whether my brother really said that in those terms.</span> <span id="s330">What my brother tells me is that there was a meeting of the twenty-odd some refugees in the hotel, and that it was decided that they should get the Hell out of there.</span> <span id="s331">Uh, and there were...there was only one family, or possibly a family and one other person, who decided not to go.</span> <span id="s332">And that family uh is the family of the two sisters that I showed you the picture of before.</span> <span id="s333">And it was a mistake, because they didn't get here until 1947.</span> <span id="s334">But anyway, so I don't remember that.</span> <span id="s335">What I do remember is that one night we left everything that we owned--which was not much, but we did have, you know, suitcases and valises and stuff.</span> <span id="s336">We left everything, and we left in the dark of night.</span> <span id="s337">And I think I have a..</span> <span id="s338">.</span> <span id="s339">my recollection is that it was like midnight, uh with nothing except my brother's violin.</span> <span id="s340">And this group of us went; and somehow, in a way that was not quite kosher, got on a train that went to the south of France.</span> <span id="s341">Uh, and then uh so I remem....</span> <span id="s342">I remember walking to the train station in Loudun, but I don't remember anything of this trip.</span> <span id="s343">But what my brother tells me is that uh when we got to the border--which I guess was Poitiers--and we had to go through this uh...you know, whatever you do at borders, uh that at that time, uh which was now 1940, the lower echelon people in these offices were still French people rather than Germans.</span> <span id="s344">And apparently one woman in this group of twenty went up to this woman in this office, and said, "Look, you know, I've really got to get across the border, because I'm here and my husband is already on the other side."</span> <span id="s345">And so this woman said, "Yeah, alright."</span> <span id="s346">You know, and stamped her whatever you needed to get stamped.</span> <span id="s347">And then she turned and said, "You know, that's also the situation for all these other people.</span> <span id="s348">They also have somebody else waiting on the other side."</span> <span id="s349">And apparently this woman, in a rather nonchalant fashion, said, "Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s350">OK."</span> <span id="s351">And so we all got across.</span> <span id="s352">And we went to somehow uh to Limoges, and now that's where my memory picks up again.</span> <span id="s353">Uh, the first...I think the first night we slept in the railroad station; and I..</span> <span id="s354">.</span> <span id="s355">I remember, I think I slept on a..</span> <span id="s356">.</span> <span id="s357">on a scale.</span> <span id="s358">You know, the kind of thing you weigh the baggage on.</span> <span id="s359">Uh, and then the next night--and I thought it was just one night, but my brother tells me it was about six weeks--we were sent to sleep in an abandoned uh circus arena that was...I guess it was stone.</span> <span id="s360">And uh...and I remember waking up the first morning we were there and being all black and blue and sore uh from just sleeping on this...on this stone.</span> <span id="s361">Uh, but my brother tells me that we were there, as I said, for six weeks and that people graduated.</span> <span id="s362">You know, gradually people found places to live, and so you kind of got to move to the better seats.</span> <span id="s363">And then, apparently, the...the most desirable place was around the periphery of the arena.</span> <span id="s364">There were these uh...what I call orange crate make-shift beds that had straw mattresses in them.</span> <span id="s365">And so that was... for the last few days we were there, I guess, we got to sleep on...on those.</span> <span id="s366">And then, uh somehow there was a..</span> <span id="s367">.</span> <span id="s368">this Jewish committee that found...you know, was helping the refugees.</span> <span id="s369">And they found uh a uh place that I think had been a pool hall, and there was a small room that must have been... I mean, it was really not a very big room.</span> <span id="s370">It might have been maybe twenty feet by twenty feet, or twenty-five feet by twenty-five feet.</span> <span id="s371">Certainly not...not any bigger than that.</span> <span id="s372">Uh, and there were about thirty women who slept in that room.</span> <span id="s373">And then, right above that, there was another room where all the...the men slept.</span> <span id="s374">And I don't remember there being any other female children except for me.</span> <span id="s375">And I could be wrong about that, but I have no recollection of anything but adults.</span> <span id="s376">And my brother slept upstairs with the men; and I have a feeling he might have been the only, you know, minor in that group as well.</span> <span id="s377">But then, I mean, this is where I really start to remember.</span> <span id="s378">I mean, I remember this place well.</span> <span id="s379">And actually, I went back there in 1963 to visit it.</span> <span id="s380">And uh so we slept in this room; and at night we had these straw mattresses, and we'd line them up.</span> <span id="s381">It was body to body on the floor.</span> <span id="s382">Uh, and then in the morning, they would get piled up against the side of the room.</span> <span id="s383">And there were all these sort of orange crates, you know, really wooden kind of crates that got pulled out.</span> <span id="s384">And we sat on those and...and ate off them and...and so on.</span> <span id="s385">And uh so we were in this room for...I don't know, quite a long time.</span> <span id="s386">And I began going to school.</span> <span id="s387">My first year of schooling was in Limoges; and I remember walking to the school, and I remember the classroom.</span> <span id="s388">And I still have my three notebooks from that year.</span> <span id="s389">And I remember the teacher, uh who I remember as a quite not very pleasant woman.</span> <span id="s390">And uh she seemed very old to me them.</span> <span id="s391">I mean, she had sort of graying hair, uh you know, with a very harshly drawn back with a bun; and she sat up on a dias.</span> <span id="s392">And uh, I mean, I remember quite a few things from this; but two things that stand out in my mind.</span> <span id="s393">Uh one is that every morning she would come down every aisle of seats with a ruler and examine your head to see if you [had] nits or cooties--uh, lice, I guess.</span> <span id="s394">And uh I don't think it ever occurred to her that, by doing that, that she was actually spreading this.</span> <span id="s395">And so sure enough, one day I came home and one of the women spotted that I had lice.</span> <span id="s396">And I mean, my recollection is that there must have been five women every day who kind of attacked me and washed my hair with kerosene, and then combed it mercilessly with, you know, these incredibly fine-toothed combs until they cleaned my head out.</span> <span id="s397">So that was kind of horrible.</span> <span id="s398">The other thing that I remember is I was ...I was very anxious to be very good in school, and I did very well at almost everything except penmanship.</span> <span id="s399">I mean, penmanship was so stressed in that thing, in that system or whatever; and I remember this teacher constantly after me, because on French r's and s's you're supposed to have this little bump, you know at the top.</span> <span id="s400">And I could never quite get that right.</span> <span id="s401">I mean, she did...she accepted all the others.</span> <span id="s402">I've never had a good penmanship, but she accepted everything else.</span> <span id="s403">But she was constantly after me about that little, you know, squiggle that I couldn't get right.</span> <span id="s404">So I remember that.</span> <span id="s405">The other thing that I remember is that everything was, in terms of food, was incredibly difficult to get.</span> <span id="s406">And so uh I..</span> <span id="s407">.</span> <span id="s408">my brother was too old to get milk, but I was allowed to have about this much milk in uh something that sort of looked like a straightened version of a coke bottle.</span> <span id="s409">And my mother insisted that we share that.</span> <span id="s410">And so, every morning we would go down and collect this... this milk.</span> <span id="s411">Uh, the thing that I remember with great pain-- and it...I think it's only as an adult that I really have added to that a kind of feeling of maybe resentment--uh because I was cute I got sent into bakeries to beg for bread.</span> <span id="s412">And the line was, "I've got uh...I have...I have money, and I have ration coupons.</span> <span id="s413">But uh..." Or maybe we didn't have ration coupons, whatever it was, you know. "</span> <span id="s414">...we really need bread."</span> <span id="s415">And so that was my role.</span> <span id="s416">And I would...that bread was not only for us, but it would be shared with some of the other people.</span> <span id="s417">And when I was interviewing my brother last year--because I wrote an article about this--I..</span> <span id="s418">.</span> <span id="s419">I said to my brother, "Did it ever occur to anybody how incredibly demeaning it must have been to a little girl to have to go in and beg for bread?"</span> <span id="s420">And my brother, who is a very practical person, looked me straight in the eye and said, "It wasn't demeaning.</span> <span id="s421">It was bread."</span> <span id="s422">And uh...but somehow I can't feel that way about it.</span> <span id="s423">And uh...and I guess...I mean, I guess we shared duties in that he had to...all the...you know, he filled out all the forms, and when things had to be packed or when you had to go to an office to ask about visas, I mean, he got to do all that.</span> <span id="s424">And, of course, I was too young to do that.</span> <span id="s425">But uh but I got this horrible chore to do, because I was younger and cuter I guess.</span> <span id="s426">Uh, so I remember that.</span> <span id="s427">Uh, and then I remember very clearly, two times uh...I think you were allowed a pound of potatoes per month per person and one egg per month per person, according to these ration coupons.</span> <span id="s428">And so, one time my mother heard that there were eggs out in this farm, which was...I mean, I remember just walking what seemed like miles and miles and miles.</span> <span id="s429">And we came home with these eggs, and my mother opened them and they were all rotten.</span> <span id="s430">And then another time, we heard that there were potatoes.</span> <span id="s431">And again, I mean, you know, it seemed as though we walked for just ages and we came home with these three pounds of potatoes.</span> <span id="s432">And I guess we were just... this is like such a feast that uh my mother just cooked the three pounds of potatoes.</span> <span id="s433">And I think we just ate them all up.</span> <span id="s434">Uh, and then there was a..</span> <span id="s435">.</span> <span id="s436">probably the most wonderful birthday of my life happened in this period.</span> <span id="s437">I don't know how my mother pulled this off; but on my birthday, uh she came with a little brown paper bag.</span> <span id="s438">And in this paper bag was--I don't remember, I think it might have been like a peach, or...and one other big fruit and some dried fruits.</span> <span id="s439">And it was probably the nicest present I've ever gotten.</span> <span id="s440">So, uh so I remember that.</span> <span id="s441">And...and the two other dramatic things that I remember from that era is one that my brother somehow had a Bar Mitzvah in the midst of this.</span> <span id="s442">And I don't remember much about the Bar Mitzvah, except that he was given a..</span> <span id="s443">.</span> <span id="s444">a silk...a beautiful blue silk string bag--which we had for years--and it was filled with uh, I don't know, just a lot of different goodies that were kind of nice.</span> <span id="s445">Uh so that was one thing I remember.</span> <span id="s446">And the other thing--and we still have one of these, and it's in my son's car, as a matter of fact.</span> <span id="s447">And I just said to my son the other day, "Don't you ever lose this!"</span> <span id="s448">Uh, somewhere, after...I don't know whether it was weeks or months, uh two things happened.</span> <span id="s449">First of all--and I can't remember which happened first--but one day these two guys walked down.</span> <span id="s450">It was sort of a mild hill, the street we were on; and these two guys came down the hill, and each of them was holding one end of a bolt of grey blanket cloth.</span> <span id="s451">And it...I mean, I still have it.</span> <span id="s452">So I can tell you with with great accuracy that this is the...the worst quality fabric I have ever felt in my life.</span> <span id="s453">I..</span> <span id="s454">.</span> <span id="s455">I don't think it had an iota of warmth in it.</span> <span id="s456">But uh it was such a..</span> <span id="s457">.</span> <span id="s458">I remember that nice feeling of these guys coming with this blanket cloth, and they just had like a knife or something.</span> <span id="s459">And they just stood there and kind of, you know, pulled off...I don't know, maybe a yard and a half.</span> <span id="s460">Uh, and everybody kind of got a square of this, and...and we got two squares.</span> <span id="s461">Uh and that was, you know, that was like manna from heaven.</span> <span id="s462">Uh, and as I say, that grey blanket is in...in ... One of them got lost somewhere; but the other one is in my son's car.</span> <span id="s463">Uh, and then I guess somewhere along those uh months, the little house right next door to where we were staying became free.</span> <span id="s464">And I don't know why we had the good fortune, but the little place next door was a one...I think it was just a one story place, and it had two rooms.</span> <span id="s465">And there was a smaller inner room, and then this larger outer room.</span> <span id="s466">And my brother and mother and I were given that little inner room.</span> <span id="s467">And the outer room was kind of divided in half.</span> <span id="s468">And the back part of it was given to these two sisters who were married to two brothers.</span> <span id="s469">And one of the brothers was named [Lutz (ph)].</span> <span id="s470">I don't remember his last name.</span> <span id="s471">And he was almost blind.</span> <span id="s472">He had very bad vision, and he spent a lot of his time cutting out those kind of leather belt loops that, you know, you hook one into the other and make belts.</span> <span id="s473">And I..</span> <span id="s474">.</span> <span id="s475">I remember we used to help him do that sometimes.</span> <span id="s476">And he did that in the outer part of this room, which was like his workspace.</span> <span id="s477">Uh, so those are, those are some of my... Oh, there was one other nice thing that I remember from Limoges.</span> <span id="s478">There was a..</span> <span id="s479">.</span> <span id="s480">a carpenter that we somehow got to know.</span> <span id="s481">Uh, and I think he was kind of a very mellow-looking guy, with maybe reddish kind of hair and beard.</span> <span id="s482">And you know, he seemed old to me then; but in retrospect he probably was thirty-five or something.</span> <span id="s483">Uh but he made a wonderful little set of toy furniture for me out of wood, and then he...he glued little pieces of wallpaper on the chairs, you know, to make it look as though they were upholstered.</span> <span id="s484">And uh I certainly had those for years and years after that, and always treasured them greatly.</span> <span id="s485">Uh, so I guess those are uh... Oh.</span> <span id="s486">One thing that I didn't mention, uh and this was from Loudun.</span> <span id="s487">We went from Loudun to Paris, to try to get visas; and that must have been like late in August of 1939.</span> <span id="s488">Uh, and I remember there was an air raid.</span> <span id="s489">My mother and my brother and I were in a hotel.</span> <span id="s490">There was an air raid, and for some reason we didn't hear it and we didn't wake up.</span> <span id="s491">Somebody came and banged on our door and woke us up, and we all rushed to this air raid [shelter] in the middle of this huge boulevard.</span> <span id="s492">And what I remember is that the smell of dog doo in that air raid shelter was just overwhelming; and I remember that sort of scary feeling of being down there and the sirens and the commotion.</span> <span id="s493">And then...and then we were told to go back to Loudun, and that we would get visas in, you know, whatever it was--six weeks or something.</span> <span id="s494">But then, of course, the war officially started.</span> <span id="s495">The Germans came in, and uh...and...and we never got back there.</span> <span id="s496">But...but that I do remember--being in Paris in the air raid shelter.</span> <span id="s497">So then uh... Well, I remember a lot about school.</span> <span id="s498">I mean, I remember doing design in school.</span> <span id="s499">I guess that was one of my favorite subjects.</span> <span id="s500">It was uh...it was...it was a very controlled kind of art class.</span> <span id="s501">Design, it was...it was not the kind of thing that kids do now.</span> <span id="s502">And you know, you colored in and out the little squares and things.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: Did you have any friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: You know, that's a very interesting question.</span> <span id="s505">I don't remember having any friends in Limoges.</span> <span id="s506">I must have known some of the kids in my class.</span> <span id="s507">My brother, I think, had a very nice sort of older boy, who was a pianist, who took him under his wing and I think did a lot for him.</span> <span id="s508">But I don't remember...I don't remember any friends.</span> <span id="s509">And I..</span> <span id="s510">.</span> <span id="s511">I think it was a very lonesome time for me.</span> <span id="s512">Uh, but I, you know, somehow I..</span> <span id="s513">.</span> <span id="s514">I played, and I played with the little doll furniture; and I uh...I think I spent a lot of time in school, and I think my mother played with me.</span> <span id="s515">And I..</span> <span id="s516">.</span> <span id="s517">I do remember one thing, actually.</span> <span id="s518">And I think this was in Limoges, but I'm not sure.</span> <span id="s519">Uh, and I think this has also stayed with me for life.</span> <span id="s520">I remember my brother was playing with a group of kids his age, and they were running.</span> <span id="s521">Maybe they were playing hide-and-seek, or something.</span> <span id="s522">And I was trying to keep up with them.</span> <span id="s523">And I fell, and I remember having these enormous scabs on...on both knees for a long time.</span> <span id="s524">And I..</span> <span id="s525">.</span> <span id="s526">I..</span> <span id="s527">.</span> <span id="s528">I know I've always had a fear of falling.</span> <span id="s529">And when our kids were small, I..</span> <span id="s530">.</span> <span id="s531">I just found it intolerable to see them run.</span> <span id="s532">And so I would always let my husband take care of that, you know; and I would sort of turn the other way.</span> <span id="s533">Because I didn't want to inhibit them.</span> <span id="s534">But uh I..</span> <span id="s535">.</span> <span id="s536">I remember that day, I remember those bloody horrible knees.</span> <span id="s537">And...and you know, and uh...but I don't remember having any little friends of my own.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: Why... When did you leave Limoges, and why?</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: Uh, we had been in touch with my father's sister and her children, and they were trying very hard to get us visas.</span> <span id="s540">And apparently we would get a visa; the visas, I guess, expired in fairly short periods.</span> <span id="s541">And so we would... apparently, we would get a visa and there would be no ship, or we couldn't get to the ship.</span> <span id="s542">And then there would be a ship, but no visa.</span> <span id="s543">And...but apparently somehow things came together, and we left and went to Marseilles.</span> <span id="s544">And again, I thought that was just for a couple of days; but my brother tells me we were there for several weeks.</span> <span id="s545">Uh, and I don't remember Marseilles at all.</span> <span id="s546">But apparently my brother did a lot of uh leg work there, and it was a matter of just standing in line after line after line.</span> <span id="s547">And then, finally, everything worked out.</span> <span id="s548">You know, we had to get an entry visa for Spain, and an entry visa for Portugal, and an exit visa for France; and it had to be done in the right order, because, you know, one couldn't be had without the other one first.</span> <span id="s549">And apparently there was an incredible amount of... of red tape and bureaucracy and waiting lines, and there was no food; and it was just a mess.</span> <span id="s550">And I don't remember any of that.</span> <span id="s551">The only thing I remember quite clearly is getting on a train one night and going through Spain.</span> <span id="s552">Now I don't remember...I didn't remember, until my brother told me, that we stopped I guess twice in cities in Spain.</span> <span id="s553">But I remember sitting in this train, which was...I mean, it was like New York during rush hour.</span> <span id="s554">Uh, and I remember that it was like this sort of totally chaotic scene.</span> <span id="s555">I mean, there were women in babushkas with big baskets; and I think there was one woman who had a chicken in her basket, you know, tied up with a scarf.</span> <span id="s556">And uh this sort of pandemonium scene, and being on this train.</span> <span id="s557">And then I don't remember anything else until we got on the ship going to the U.S. Uh, but my brother uh has a lovely story about going through the uh border check, uh at the Portuguese border.</span> <span id="s558">And he said... you know, I mean, there was no food on the train.</span> <span id="s559">It was a mess.</span> <span id="s560">It was dirty and everything.</span> <span id="s561">And then everybody had to get off to go through customs; and my brother said, "When we got back on the train, it was like a different world.</span> <span id="s562">You could smell fresh rolls, and it was all clean."</span> <span id="s563">And uh so he...he just, you know... I mean, when he tells that, he just breaks out into this wonderful smile.</span> <span id="s564">Uh, and I don't remember being in Lisbon.</span> <span id="s565">Apparently, we walked around there for two weeks, waiting for this ship--which was called the S.S. Exeter--to sail.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: Let's hold it there for a minute.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: We skipped the St. Louis, huh?</span> <span id="s568">(Laughter)</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: We'll change tapes.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">TAPE #2</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: Let's pick up now.</span> <span id="s572">You are on the train, and you have arrived in Portugal.</span> <span id="s573">Uh, what happens when you get off the train?</span> <span id="s574">Where did you go?</span> <span id="s575">What do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: I don't remember anything until we got on the ship.</span> <span id="s577">And then I only remember something which is not very pleasant; and that is, that I guess on the ship uh there was, you know, suddenly food.</span> <span id="s578">I mean, real meals, and...you know, and a dining room which looked nice, and so on.</span> <span id="s579">But all three of us were seasick, essentially, the whole way across the Atlantic.</span> <span id="s580">And so uh I don't think we were able to, after finally getting to some nice food, uh to really avail ourselves of it.</span> <span id="s581">Uh, and I guess that's about all I remember about that trip, uh until we arrived in the U.S. And one of my earliest recollections, there was something that was very uh...it caused a lot of apprehension in me; because uh I had never seen an oral thermometer, because in Europe we use these underarm, you know, mammoth-sized thermometers.</span> <span id="s582">And these people, I think, in white uniforms came around; and I remember sitting in this big room in these chairs, and somebody came around and stuck an oral thermometer in everybody's mouth.</span> <span id="s583">Uh, so I think I was apprehensive, not only because I was little and I..</span> <span id="s584">.</span> <span id="s585">you know, this seemed like really weird.</span> <span id="s586">Uh, but as an adult, as I look back, I have a feeling that I also was very aware that this was still another check point and that you could still be turned away.</span> <span id="s587">And I don't know whether somebody had told me that, you know, if you weren't healthy you couldn't come in.</span> <span id="s588">I mean, maybe my mother had been talking about that or something.</span> <span id="s589">But I remember that arrival time as being a time of...of apprehension.</span> <span id="s590">And then I remember being picked up by the relatives.</span> <span id="s591">Uh, and what I..</span> <span id="s592">.</span> <span id="s593">what I remember most dramatically... Well, first of all, there was this...I think it was a big fancy black car.</span> <span id="s594">I mean, not fancy by American terms; but to a small kid who, you know, just had not seen anything like this for a long time.</span> <span id="s595">Uh, and I was sitting in the back seat with my mother and my brother.</span> <span id="s596">And my mother was next to me, and she was at the window seat; and my aunt lived in uh...in the lower part of Manhattan, which was not a very nice place--uh, Avenue D. And uh as we drove into that neighborhood, my mother...I mean, I could hear her.</span> <span id="s597">I could hear her very audibly.</span> <span id="s598">My mother whispered in German, under her breath, something like, "Have I suffered so long, and come all this way, for this?"</span> <span id="s599">And I think that that was...I mean, that struck me as being... I mean, in retrospect... As I think back on it, I don't know what I thought at the time.</span> <span id="s600">But in retrospect, it seems like such an ungrateful statement to make at that moment.</span> <span id="s601">Because, you know, I mean, suddenly we were free.</span> <span id="s602">And uh...but I think she was so appalled.</span> <span id="s603">And I don't...you know, I'm not sure why she was so appalled, because it surely must have been better than, you know, what had been in France, and so on.</span> <span id="s604">But uh...but anyway, that's ...I remember her saying that.</span> <span id="s605">And uh so then uh we went and lived in my Aunt Lena, who was Lena Klinghoffer.</span> <span id="s606">Uh she had what was really quite a small apartment, and she had five children.</span> <span id="s607">And they were grown; but three of them were still living in this apartment.</span> <span id="s608">Uh, and Leon and [Albe (ph)], the two boys, were living at home; and the youngest daughter, Dorothy.</span> <span id="s609">Uh, and somehow she made the kids double up.</span> <span id="s610">And...and so my brother and my mother and I got one tiny bedroom, and we actually lived there with her for about three months.</span> <span id="s611">And uh I guess my mother went out apartment hunting and job hunting, and so on.</span> <span id="s612">Uh, and I mean, I remember a lot of anecdotal things happened in my Aunt Lena's house.</span> <span id="s613">Like uh uh...I mean, everybody sort of assumed that, because we had been starving for the last two years, that we would eat anything that was put in front of us.</span> <span id="s614">Well, that was not true at all.</span> <span id="s615">My brother and I were the world's fussiest, pickiest eaters.</span> <span id="s616">And you know, and this food that was put in front of us was...I mean, it was very alien kind of...of food.</span> <span id="s617">Uh, and so we...we...and probably our stomachs were so shrunken anyway that we didn't need very much.</span> <span id="s618">And so we...we were very...you know, we didn't eat a lot of things that were put in front of us.</span> <span id="s619">And I think my aunt thought that was very peculiar.</span> <span id="s620">And uh uh...and then I..</span> <span id="s621">.</span> <span id="s622">I remember, uh you know, my mother had always been very proud of the fact that she never learned to cook, and that she...you know, that other people had done things for her.</span> <span id="s623">And uh, of course, she very quickly, when we got out apartment, learned how to cook a certain number of things.</span> <span id="s624">But uh she would always say, "I don't even know how to boil water."</span> <span id="s625">And then one time my Aunt Lena got sick, and the kids were out.</span> <span id="s626">And...and I think my mother really...I don't know, she was supposed to make some porridge or something.</span> <span id="s627">And she really...she sort of couldn't do it, you know.</span> <span id="s628">Hard to believe.</span> <span id="s629">And I don't know; I sometimes get the feeling that it was like almost, you know, could she really not do this?</span> <span id="s630">I mean, how do you get to grow up and not know how to do this?</span> <span id="s631">Or was it all a put-up job?</span> <span id="s632">Well, I don't know.</span> <span id="s633">Uh, turned out that my mother was a very talented lady.</span> <span id="s634">And uh...and uh very quickly learned how to do all the things that...that were needed.</span> <span id="s635">And I think the really sad thing is that uh there was nobody around to really guide her about what she should do.</span> <span id="s636">And you know, and...and my Aunt Lena was not a wealthy woman.</span> <span id="s637">And uh so I think it was...it was necessary to uh... to sort of quickly get something going.</span> <span id="s638">And so my mother did uh the easiest thing, and the first thing that came her way.</span> <span id="s639">And she spent the whole rest of her life working as a sewing machine operator in a factory.</span> <span id="s640">Which was kind of very heavy work, uh but I think... And she's a very hard worker, but... And I think it was not so much the hard work that bothered her; but I think she was...she was very, very bothered by the kinds of people that she met in the factory, and she felt totally alien from those people.</span> <span id="s641">You know, they uh... I mean, she was...she made acquaintances very easily, but she didn't make friends very easily.</span> <span id="s642">Uh, and I think the people that she tended to make real friendships with, insofar as she did, were always, you know, other people her age from Vienna, or other places like that, who sort of...you know, where they could talk about what had been, or whatever it was.</span> <span id="s643">Uh, and she just found the conditions in the factory appalling.</span> <span id="s644">Uh, I mean she was so ...first of all, she was so European and so formal.</span> <span id="s645">And I mean, it...it drove her crazy that people called her by her first name.</span> <span id="s646">I mean, nobody every would have done that.</span> <span id="s647">You know, she was "Frau Dr. Reif," and not, you know... And all of a sudden, she's "Klara."</span> <span id="s648">Uh, she would come home, and sometimes... I think one time she even cried, because she walked into an office and some guy was sitting at the desk with his feet up; and he didn't take his feet off the desk when she walked in.</span> <span id="s649">Well, you know, you didn't treat ladies that way.</span> <span id="s650">And uh uh...and then, I mean, the whole new thing to her was the kind of language that people used in the factory.</span> <span id="s651">I mean, she had never heard anything like this before.</span> <span id="s652">And so she...you know, and...and gradually she learned to cope with it, and she kind of... You know, she would kid around with people at work; but I don't think she ever, you know, really felt happy in that situation.</span> <span id="s653">And as I say, it wasn't just the hard work, but it was really more that she just felt this was not her milieu.</span> <span id="s654">Uh so she was a very...I mean, she was a very...basically a lonesome, unhappy woman in many ways in her life.</span> <span id="s655">But, on the other hand, on the surface she was not.</span> <span id="s656">I mean, she...you know, she always kept herself busy and very involved in this and that and the other thing.</span> <span id="s657">And she learned English, I think, relatively quickly.</span> <span id="s658">Uh, and uh she...you know, kept herself active and always knew where all the free concerts and free plays were, and took advantage of all those cultural things, and ran around to the museums.</span> <span id="s659">And uh uh...and so she did all those things.</span> <span id="s660">And I..</span> <span id="s661">.</span> <span id="s662">actually, I should say that really was much later; because in the early days, life uh... in the early years, life was very very difficult.</span> <span id="s663">So after three months, when we left my Aunt Lena's house and got an apartment in Brooklyn, uh I think at her first job she was earning $15 a week.</span> <span id="s664">And I think the rent was $45 a month in this apartment, or maybe $35 a month.</span> <span id="s665">So for...for a long time she hardly ate.</span> <span id="s666">I mean, you know, all her money went to paying the rent and feeding us.</span> <span id="s667">And uh...I mean, she was the usual, you know, Jewish mother.</span> <span id="s668">I mean, we came first always, everything, you know.</span> <span id="s669">Uh, and she gradually...you know, she...I..</span> <span id="s670">.</span> <span id="s671">she never... I mean, she would have been a fantastic bookkeeper, and she would have been so much happier, you know, if somebody had led her into that when she...once she mastered the language.</span> <span id="s672">But they didn't.</span> <span id="s673">So she spent the rest of the time in the factories.</span> <span id="s674">And uh she...uh she really...she did not... I don't know what to call it.</span> <span id="s675">I mean, for example, my brother and I never worked.</span> <span id="s676">You know, and in retrospect that's really weird.</span> <span id="s677">Nobody ever asked us to contribute to the family income.</span> <span id="s678">Uh, our job was to study; and everything, you know, kind of rotated around that.</span> <span id="s679">Uh, so that...and in some sense, I mean, you could say that I was a spoiled brat once I came here.</span> <span id="s680">Because when I wanted to do my homework, I told my mother she couldn't wash the dishes until after I finished.</span> <span id="s681">Because the noise of the water running bothered me.</span> <span id="s682">So here's this lady who's been working in the factory and then, you know, travelling and...and coming home.</span> <span id="s683">And I mean, I did help around the house a little bit.</span> <span id="s684">Uh, but I mean, she basically made dinner and she washed the dishes.</span> <span id="s685">I think I sometimes dried them.</span> <span id="s686">And uh so she did all this work, and then she...she did this incredible bookkeeping thing every night.</span> <span id="s687">She would not go to sleep until the amount of money in her change purse matched with this little...she had a little book she carried with her.</span> <span id="s688">And every...even if it was only two cents, it got written down; uh and it had to match to the penny.</span> <span id="s689">And she would go over it, and over it and over it again.</span> <span id="s690">You know, "Where did I spend that extra ...?"</span> <span id="s691">Whatever, even if it was only three cents, until that matched everyday.</span> <span id="s692">And it got to be funny, because in...in later years once I remember having a little argument with her about how much a certain dress that I had cost.</span> <span id="s693">And she just went right back and pulled out her book.</span> <span id="s694">"No, that was...you know, it was $13.95!"</span> <span id="s695">(Laughter)</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: What about uh you, during these years?</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: Well, uh I think I was kind of a..</span> <span id="s698">.</span> <span id="s699">in some sense, a dual personality kid.</span> <span id="s700">I mean, I was...I liked to play, and I was kind of, you know, fun-loving and...on one side.</span> <span id="s701">Uh, but there was this other side of me that was serious and thoughtful, and I guess introspective and a lot of other things.</span> <span id="s702">And...and lonesome.</span> <span id="s703">Uh, not the kind of lonesome that... I wrote a poem about this, actually.</span> <span id="s704">More thinking about my mother; but not the kind of lonesome that goes away when other people are around, but just a kind of inherent feeling of...I don't know.</span> <span id="s705">Uh, I mean, only now in recent years I very often think that the only way I can explain it is, you know, maybe it's what happens to a kid... I mean, what happens when a four year-old kid is told that she's never going to see her father again.</span> <span id="s706">Especially, you know, having been told that...that he was incredibly affectionate to me.</span> <span id="s707">I mean, what does that do?</span> <span id="s708">What does that mean?</span> <span id="s709">Uh, so I mean...I mean, I still am basically...I..</span> <span id="s710">.</span> <span id="s711">you know, I love to dance and I like to sing.</span> <span id="s712">I'm a very uh...and I love to tell jokes.</span> <span id="s713">And my brother and I love to tell jokes.</span> <span id="s714">Uh uh...but there's a very incredibly serious part of my brother, which is much more evident I think in him than in me.</span> <span id="s715">But there's a very morbid part of me also.</span> <span id="s716">I mean, it's a..</span> <span id="s717">.</span> <span id="s718">I don't, you know, it's...it's like a little sideline, but it never goes away.</span> <span id="s719">So uh...and then I think, I mean, my mother certainly tried very hard.</span> <span id="s720">But I think she did and said some things that were not really very good for kids growing up.</span> <span id="s721">She always told us that we were different.</span> <span id="s722">I don't think that was very good for us.</span> <span id="s723">Uh, we were supposed to be "aristocratic"--you know, in quotes.</span> <span id="s724">I mean, that was a myth.</span> <span id="s725">I don't...we were not aristocratic in Europe, either.</span> <span id="s726">I mean, we were just reasonable, middle-classed people.</span> <span id="s727">Uh, but uh so I always felt different.</span> <span id="s728">I felt different, anyway.</span> <span id="s729">I mean, you know, I come, here I am at age seven learning my third language, and sort of--if you consider the whole Judaic thing--my fourth culture uh by age seven.</span> <span id="s730">And I remember coming to school in the U.S.; and you know, all the little girls and boys around me are, you know, obviously talking about me.</span> <span id="s731">And I can't understand what they're saying.</span> <span id="s732">Well, I learned English really fast, let me tell you.</span> <span id="s733">Uh, but I always felt different.</span> <span id="s734">Well, you know, the more different you feel, somehow you stay different and you become different.</span> <span id="s735">And uh uh...and to this day, I still...I mean, no matter...I mean, I always feel different.</span> <span id="s736">And I think I never thought of it, but there was a Nobel Prize-winning physicist that they interviewed in the [Boston] Globe; and he said, "I always felt a little different, and it always hurt a little."</span> <span id="s737">And when I read that, I thought, "That's...that's really...that describes me."</span> <span id="s738">Because I think subconsciously, somehow I've always wanted to belong to certain, you know...I don't know-- whatever, you know, groups of things.</span> <span id="s739">Not ever to belong to...uh, I mean, I rarely sign things and I don't want to belong.</span> <span id="s740">I don't uh...I don't like being associated with divisive things.</span> <span id="s741">I mean, I have very mixed feelings about, you know, even about belonging to the...the quality of being Jewish, or whatever you want to call it.</span> <span id="s742">Uh, because I think that's very divisive.</span> <span id="s743">I mean, I..</span> <span id="s744">.</span> <span id="s745">you know, all the divisive things that have happened in history have happened because people are...you know, belong to...to some of these things.</span> <span id="s746">So that's not the kind of belonging that I want.</span> <span id="s747">But the...belonging to...to, for example, uh... Oh, you know.</span> <span id="s748">Within an academic environment, uh people who have similar interests or people who like to do some activity or something.</span> <span id="s749">And I always...I mean, I'm 55 years old but I still always feel that there is something different about me compared to all these other people.</span> <span id="s750">And it always...in some strange way, there's a difference.</span> <span id="s751">Uh, and then, of course, when I was little, the difference became greatly exacerbated because there was such an an emphasis put on learning and studying and so on.</span> <span id="s752">And that was not the favorite activity of most of the other kids at 1092 President Street.</span> <span id="s753">And so the other kids would come home and uh go out and, you know, play--this, that and the other thing.</span> <span id="s754">And I would very often...I mean, I did play outside in the street, too.</span> <span id="s755">But I did a Hell of a lot of homework.</span> <span id="s756">And in retrospect, I think I did a lot more homework than was ever assigned.</span> <span id="s757">Uh, so...and I, you know, I just...I mean, those kids were different.</span> <span id="s758">They were not interested.</span> <span id="s759">And I, at some very early age, decided I was going to be a scientist and I was going to do this and that and the other thing.</span> <span id="s760">And they, I mean, they didn't have any aspirations.</span> <span id="s761">And uh I suppose part of that was enhanced, in that, you know, I mean my mother just kind of expected that we would do things and she knew that they were not going to do things.</span> <span id="s762">And uh...and I think she did not let that pass quietly by.</span> <span id="s763">Uh, so anyway, I uh...you know, I was...I played and I uh...but I didn't do any...I was not allowed to do anything dangerous.</span> <span id="s764">And that included uh... My mother used to have a fit.</span> <span id="s765">I mean, in those days people thought that if you walked up and down the stairs--and we lived on a fourth-floor walk-up--that you'd get a heart attack.</span> <span id="s766">So you know, so it was a major issue about my walking, you know, every time I had to walk up and down the stairs.</span> <span id="s767">Uh, I was not allowed to uh ride a bicycle, uh when the other kids were learning to ride bicycles; and I think...I think partly that was a financial matter.</span> <span id="s768">You know, I mean, it took a quarter an hour to rent a bicycle.</span> <span id="s769">Uh, but I think mostly it was a safety matter.</span> <span id="s770">But one of the things that happened very early on is that uh...I mean, I had this brother who was almost eight years older, who was a very...we were very close; and I had my mother, who was a very worrisome Jewish mother.</span> <span id="s771">And I think very early on, there were many times when my mother would say "Black," and my brother would say, "White."</span> <span id="s772">And at a very early age, I think I discerned that my brother's responses came from the head and my mother's responses came straight from the gut.</span> <span id="s773">And that, obviously, from the head was better.</span> <span id="s774">And uh so whenever there was...you know, whenever I had to make a decision between the two opinions, I almost invariably did what my brother said.</span> <span id="s775">Uh, and he was very protective of me; and we had a very sort of uh weird family situation, probably, in retrospect.</span> <span id="s776">But it was a very uh uh loving, and very uh you know sort of...we were always, you know, sort of kissing and that kind of thing.</span> <span id="s777">And, by and large, people did not yell, and...and so on.</span> <span id="s778">But if my brother heard my mother say something to me in the kitchen, because I..</span> <span id="s779">.</span> <span id="s780">he had his own room but I studied in the kitchen, uh he would be right there.</span> <span id="s781">"What are you saying to this child?"</span> <span id="s782">And uh I remember funny things, like uh if I had a cold uh my mother would say, "Well, maybe you should stay home from school and stay in bed."</span> <span id="s783">And my brother said, "You take two handkerchiefs, and hang one out to dry while you're using the other one.</span> <span id="s784">And go to school."</span> <span id="s785">Well, I mean, I went to school with the two handkerchiefs; and uh uh...so and I guess...I guess, I probably spent or tried to spend and probably did spend a certain amount of time with my brother's friends, who were much older than me.</span> <span id="s786">I mean, they were adults and I was still a kid.</span> <span id="s787">And I think they were trying to get rid of me a certain amount of the time.</span> <span id="s788">I mean, they did...my brother took me to my first museum.</span> <span id="s789">And one of his friends took me to my first ballet, and so on.</span> <span id="s790">Uh, and I remember once my mother getting involved, because my brother didn't want to take me someplace he was going with a friend.</span> <span id="s791">And my mother - I remember this is so ridiculous - my mother said, "You can't go, because Fred is big enough to walk between the rain drops but you aren't."</span> <span id="s792">(Laughter) Uh, so it was not a typical childhood, in that sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s794">Thank you very much.</span> <span id="s795">You seem to have pulled a lot of it together.</span> <span id="s796">I think before we break, though, what I'd like to ask you... First of all, is there anything that you want to add that you haven't already covered?</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: Well, uh, yeah.</span> <span id="s798">I think maybe I'd like to mention that I talk about this very easily now, but that all the times when my mother was still alive and that she wanted to talk about some of these things, I really didn't want to hear about it.</span> <span id="s799">I didn't want to listen.</span> <span id="s800">Uh, first of all, because she would get very emotional, and I..</span> <span id="s801">.</span> <span id="s802">And I mean, in retrospect, I couldn't tolerate that.</span> <span id="s803">Uh, and I know sometimes now when I get emotional about something, I can see my kids responding in the same way.</span> <span id="s804">I mean, that [they] don't really need this.</span> <span id="s805">Uh, and so I really went through very many years, essentially, not thinking very much about this and making believe it never happened.</span> <span id="s806">And when the other kids or other people would ask me, "Well, what effect do you think your background had on you?"</span> <span id="s807">I would say, "Well, I was too young and I don't remember anything, and I don't think it had any effect on me."</span> <span id="s808">And I think uh--and I've been trying to write about some of these issues--I think that there's a certain age, and I see this in other people, when you have a period of great strength and you're sort of building your life and it's very easy to sort of not look back and push everything aside.</span> <span id="s809">And then I think there comes another period, when for me and for I think for other people also, somehow the back...background comes back to haunt you.</span> <span id="s810">And it wasn't really until after our kids were born, and...and uh you know maybe when I was about 35, that I started noticing that I..</span> <span id="s811">.</span> <span id="s812">that certain things I did were not really logically explainable by...by things that were happening then.</span> <span id="s813">And that the only logical explanation of why I was doing certain things in that way, or doing them at all, had to do probably with some of the things that had happened very early in life in Vienna.</span> <span id="s814">And you know, my father disappearing and uh...and things that happened in... in France and uh...and in that school in Limoges, and uh... and that whole business of sort always being on the run for those years, and being scared, and uh... And I think there is a lot of interesting material uh to explore there.</span> <span id="s815">Uh, and uh...and to explore with other people who have had similar experiences.</span> <span id="s816">Uh, I think the unfortunate thing--and being a scientist, I mean, I would always like to have a controlled experiment, and of course there is no controlled experiment--but trying to pick apart.</span> <span id="s817">Uh, and of course it's only conjectural, and it's like playing pick-up sticks; but somehow trying to define for myself, you know, what things that have stayed with me are really due to the things that happened because of the war and the things that happened in France, and so on.</span> <span id="s818">And what things are just because...you know, I mean everybody's parents by and large are crazy anyway.</span> <span id="s819">Right?</span> <span id="s820">And...and so you, your parents uh somehow inflict on you uh some of that craziness that they have.</span> <span id="s821">Uh, and it's hard to tell, because of course I don't know what kind of person my mother was before the war started.</span> <span id="s822">And it's only in recent years, and actually since she's died, that I've really thought enough about this to to realize that, you know, she might have been and probably was a very sort of, you know, happy carefree person in many ways uh but I never knew her.</span> <span id="s823">I mean, my mother wore black for years and years and years; and then she finally switched to navy.</span> <span id="s824">And it was, you know, it was only very very late, when I was already essentially an adult that she would ever wear anything that was red, or uh uh...and she always, you know, all the years she lived she kept up on [my] father's grave.</span> <span id="s825">She always you know, lit a uh yahrzeit candle.</span> <span id="s826">Uh uh she she always uh...you know, I mean, she always I think in...in many ways--in her thoughts, at least--she always lived in her past.</span> <span id="s827">Not...not in her actions, but you know... "If I only had my sister to talk to," and so on.</span> <span id="s828">And then one other thing that I should have mentioned, uh because I..</span> <span id="s829">.</span> <span id="s830">I do remember this and it was very dramatic was right after the war was over.</span> <span id="s831">There was a blue letter that arrived from...I think it was from a cousin of my mother's who ended up in Israel--and I don't know if he's still alive or not--uh sort of delineating what had happened to many of our relatives.</span> <span id="s832">And I mean, that, you know, I remember it as being horrendous; but now, when I think back, that must have been just such an incredible nightmare to my mother.</span> <span id="s833">Because the news in that letter, as you can imagine, was...I mean, essentially everybody was killed, and...and some of them in rather grotesque ways.</span> <span id="s834">Uh and I..</span> <span id="s835">.</span> <span id="s836">I guess I wish I could have been a little bit more understanding of me in relation to my background, and I think that would have lead to...to my having a better understanding and appreciation of my mother uh during those years.</span> <span id="s837">Uh, my mother and I, by the way, got along very well uh until the other girls started dating.</span> <span id="s838">And then she got... END OF TAPE ...like our live-in baby sitters.</span> <span id="s839">And I had my very strong, very very democratic ideas about uh...you know, the way those people should be done, should be treated.</span> <span id="s840">And I..</span> <span id="s841">.</span> <span id="s842">and I think in some sense there was kind of...I guess, she verbalized it often.</span> <span id="s843">She felt that we treated our live-in baby sitters better than we treated her.</span> <span id="s844">And that was probably true, because they didn't sort of interfere in our lives.</span> <span id="s845">And she somehow tried to continue to be a mother when she should have become a friend.</span> <span id="s846">And I think...I mean, in retrospect now that was because she was very lonesome.</span> <span id="s847">So there's a lot more, I suppose, to be said; but maybe I'll write it sometime.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s849">I hope you do.</span> <span id="s850">Uh, thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: Is there anything else you wanted to...?</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Q: As a postscript, yeah.</span> <span id="s853">We'll get to photos in a minute, but because you lived in the Klinghoffers...lived with the Klinghoffers for a while and there has been a great interest lately in Leon Klinghoffer, after the Achille Lauro incident, do you remember Leon?</span> <span id="s854">Can you describe him as a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A: Uh, I remember...I remember all five children uh very well.</span> <span id="s856">Uh, I guess I sort of uh really liked at first the youngest daughter best, because she was so pretty and dynamic and she dressed so nicely.</span> <span id="s857">And I was a little girl, and uh...and I guess, I didn't take very much interest in the two boys.</span> <span id="s858">I think partly because they were involved in, you know, they ran this hardware store and they were busy; but I think also they seemed a little gruff to me.</span> <span id="s859">Uh, the girls, all - actually it's funny - the girls were all very well-spoken even, though the boys come in the middle.</span> <span id="s860">But the boys have much more of a vernacular New York way of speaking, and uh... But anyway, they...they were - I don't know, they just didn't uh...they were not so interesting to me when I was a little girl.</span> <span id="s861">And I did occasionally go to the store and so on.</span> <span id="s862">But the thing that I remember just incredibly about Leon uh is that, somewhere along the years there, uh my mother said I could have some piano lessons with this absolutely horrible teacher.</span> <span id="s863">I mean, it was a dollar an hour.</span> <span id="s864">And I don't know whether that was a lot in those days - I think it was not even a lot in those days.</span> <span id="s865">But she was...she was not a very good teacher.</span> <span id="s866">Uh but anyway.</span> <span id="s867">And I only took lessons for maybe a year or something, but somehow in the course of that year--or maybe it was a little longer--there were two recitals where I played, you know, a diddley something-- "In My Country Garden," or something-- for you know thirty seconds.</span> <span id="s868">At one of these recitals uh... and you have to understand that in those days I could never have anything that any of the other kids had, and I rationalized it very well.</span> <span id="s869">I always said I didn't want any of the other things.</span> <span id="s870">But uh at Easter time, you know, the other kids would get new suits, and I..</span> <span id="s871">.</span> <span id="s872">I usually didn't, and so on.</span> <span id="s873">Leon Klinghoffer appeared at my little diddley piano recital with this unbelievable bouquet of pink peonies, you know; which are these really hugh full flowers.</span> <span id="s874">And I..</span> <span id="s875">.</span> <span id="s876">I just will never forget that.</span> <span id="s877">I mean, that was...that made quite an impression.</span> <span id="s878">And just a few months ago, I was thumbing through one of my mother's old photo albums and on one of the last pages this, there was this bunch of flower petals, and in one corner one of these flower petals - you know, they were all brown, there was still a little bit of pink and I suddenly realized that those were probably the left-over of the pink peonies uh so that was one thing.</span> <span id="s879">Then I remember Leon Klinghoffer went into the army and I remember hearing that he uh I don't know whether - but anyway something happened and I guess he was in Europe and he became hard of hearing in one ear uh and then he came back and he met this very attractive doll-like woman who he married, Marilyn Klinghoffer.</span> <span id="s880">Uh and I remember sort of thinking, because he was not really very attractive physically, and uh I think he already then maybe had a receding hairline and uh so he must have looked very old to me, and here, you know, he married this incredibly uh pretty uh woman uh and they went on to have kids.</span> <span id="s881">And my mother kind of kept contact and went to the wedding and I don't remember where I was at the time, but I I didn't go and I didn't see Leon Klinghoffer for a long time.</span> <span id="s882">I did occasionally, like in college I needed something and I went to his store to buy it and uh but about what must have been maybe 1983 maybe one of the other members of the family had a bar mitzvah in Worcester and Leon came.</span> <span id="s883">And by that time, he had already had a stroke.</span> <span id="s884">Uh, and he pulled me over to him--and I remember it just brought tears to my eyes, even then--he pulled me over.</span> <span id="s885">And his speech was quite slurred, because of the stroke, at that time; and we just talked for a little while.</span> <span id="s886">And he said, "You know, I want you to know that your mother was really a very good woman."</span> <span id="s887">Uh, and I..</span> <span id="s888">.</span> <span id="s889">I remember being incredibly impressed that night uh by talking to Marilyn.</span> <span id="s890">And she was still so attractive-looking; and thinking, you know, "What a fantastic lady this is!</span> <span id="s891">I mean, she takes care of him, she works..." And you know, and she had told me all these stories about the some of the things she did for her kids.</span> <span id="s892">And I..</span> <span id="s893">.</span> <span id="s894">I really felt this incredible feeling of respect for her; and I took her business card, because she was working I think for a publishing company at the time, and I put it on my bulletin board.</span> <span id="s895">And I said, "You know, I really think I ought to get to know Marilyn better."</span> <span id="s896">But then, of course, you know, she was in New York and I was in New England.</span> <span id="s897">And uh I guess I talked to her maybe once or twice more at another family function.</span> <span id="s898">And then there was this morning in October of '85.</span> <span id="s899">I was sitting at breakfast next to my husband, and he had the newspaper open.</span> <span id="s900">And I was reading something else.</span> <span id="s901">And I, out of the corner of my eye, I saw this picture.</span> <span id="s902">And the thought went through my mind, "Gee, that lady looks just like Marilyn Klinghoffer."</span> <span id="s903">And just seconds later, my husband said, "Isn't your cousin's name Klinghoffer?"</span> <span id="s904">And I said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s905">And he showed me this article uh about the highjacking of the Achille Lauro.</span> <span id="s906">And I..</span> <span id="s907">.</span> <span id="s908">I couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s909">And I think it was either later that same day or the next morning, we turned on the television and he had been shot.</span> <span id="s910">And I..</span> <span id="s911">.</span> <span id="s912">I mean, I was just totally incredulous.</span> <span id="s913">Uh, well, I think would have been incredulous if it had been anybody that I knew on that ship, anyway.</span> <span id="s914">But somehow for it to be this person who was part of the family, that helped get us over here; and it was now, you know, forty-five years later.</span> <span id="s915">Uh, I mean, I..</span> <span id="s916">.</span> <span id="s917">and you know, I kept...I kept thinking to myself, you know, "Statistically, what are the chances that these two events should be in the same person's life?"</span> <span id="s918">And I..</span> <span id="s919">.</span> <span id="s920">it was... Anyway, I went down to that funeral.</span> <span id="s921">And that whole family is very...they are very closed-mouthed about when things go wrong.</span> <span id="s922">I mean, in contrast to the people that I hang around with, who...who are very...you know, they sort of talk about this one's got this and this one just had an operation and so on.</span> <span id="s923">And so, when I was going down to the funeral, somebody--it was Dorothy, I think--said to me, "Well, you know, I think Marilyn's been ill."</span> <span id="s924">And because I have this morbid streak, I mean, immediately the worst thing crossed my mind.</span> <span id="s925">But I..</span> <span id="s926">.</span> <span id="s927">you know, nobody had said anything.</span> <span id="s928">And so... But then after the funeral, everybody went to Marilyn's house; and she just looked like living Hell.</span> <span id="s929">And I, as I was leaving to go back on the train, I..</span> <span id="s930">.</span> <span id="s931">I kissed her good-bye.</span> <span id="s932">And I ...and I said, you know, "Well, maybe you'd like to come up and visit us, or something.</span> <span id="s933">And I'll see you again."</span> <span id="s934">And she sort of looked at me; and she said, you know, "OK, darling.</span> <span id="s935">And uh...and I..</span> <span id="s936">.</span> <span id="s937">I thought, "Something is wrong with this woman."</span> <span id="s938">And a minute later, I said, you know, "Don't be silly!"</span> <span id="s939">I mean, you know, how would you look if you had just been through this whole thing, and...and your husband had been shot, and so on?</span> <span id="s940">And uh...and then nobody said anything.</span> <span id="s941">And then I remember, in...I guess it was in December, we wake up to the news; and the minute the news went on, the first thing was that Marilyn Klinghoffer had died of cancer.</span> <span id="s942">And, you know, it was just...well, I..</span> <span id="s943">.</span> <span id="s944">I never knew her that well.</span> <span id="s945">And I just...you know, I just felt very sad, because I somehow thought that I'd like to get to know her better and I never did.</span> <span id="s946">And all those other good things.</span> <span id="s947">But, so uh...that's the connection.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s949">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">DOCUMENTS &amp; PHOTOGRAPHS (1) Uh this is my mother and my father and I think this was probably uh shortly after they had gotten either engaged or married, which I think must have been about 1925.</span> <span id="s952">They got engaged in '25; so this is from that general period.</span> <span id="s953">My brother was born in '27.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">(2) This is a picture that was taken shortly after my father's death.</span> <span id="s955">And uh uh that's me cheek-to-cheek with my mother, and uh that's my brother on the other side.</span> <span id="s956">And uh I don't know.</span> <span id="s957">Somehow, to me this picture says it all.</span> <span id="s958">It's just, I mean, all the faces look very grief-stricken.</span> <span id="s959">And especially--I didn't mention this before, but--my brother.</span> <span id="s960">Who, of course, was much older; was uh...he, I guess he never got along very well with my mother.</span> <span id="s961">But he really liked my father very much.</span> <span id="s962">And I think he was incredibly devastated.</span> <span id="s963">And I think during those times when my father was so uh depressed, I know he told me that that my mother just couldn't take it anymore and she would go off and do other things.</span> <span id="s964">And he would stand in a dark room, just holding my father's hand.</span> <span id="s965">And I think...I think he was just totally, you know, knocked for a loop that his favorite parent was taken away from him that way.</span> <span id="s966">And I think it really shows in his face.</span> <span id="s967">And I think uh...I think you can see in my mother's face that she is just totally, you know, broken up; and...and I have a feeling that I probably didn't really understand too much about what was going on.</span> <span id="s968">But I think I must have reflected all the feelings that were happening around me.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">(3) Uh, this June there was a 50th reunion of the survivors of the St. Louis uh in Miami.</span> <span id="s970">And uh one evening, there was a dinner and a lot of people brought various artifacts.</span> <span id="s971">And this uh woman by the name of Mr.... Actually, a couple--the Irones (ph)--brought a photo album; and I was sort of thumbing through it, and I found these two photographs with me in it.</span> <span id="s972">And this one not only had me--and here I am, right here--uh but this one also had a picture of my brother looking absolutely miserable.</span> <span id="s973">And my first thought was that he look miserable because he was forced to wear a double-breasted suit with short pants.</span> <span id="s974">But uh I think he looked miserable because he just really knew what was going on; and I think he was very serious and unhappy on the trip.</span> <span id="s975">But I guess this was mostly a group of the children; uh and this is actually the woman with whom I roomed at the reunion, and who I had gone to visit about fifteen years ago.</span> <span id="s976">She lives near Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s977">Uh, so that was a great find.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">(4) This is a photograph of one page of our passport, which we have in a very well-preserved condition.</span> <span id="s979">It's the usual passport, with the swastika on the cover and a big red J; and uh it has a lot of information.</span> <span id="s980">It tells that we left from Hamburghafen on May 13th, 1939.</span> <span id="s981">And then it has a picture of my mother on one page, and our names with the uh the Jewish middle names--uh, Sarah for me--appended.</span> <span id="s982">And on this page, it says in French: "Refugees of the S.S. St. Louis.</span> <span id="s983">Reif, Chaje"--which is my mother's Jewish name--"et ses deux enfants, uh Friedrich et Liane"--"and her two children, Frederick and Liane."</span> <span id="s984">Uh, and of course there are many such passports.</span> <span id="s985">But for me, uh somehow especially because I didn't think about this for such a long time, every once in a while when this whole episode comes into my mind, I sort of think, you know, this...this can't possibly really have happened to me.</span> <span id="s986">This is some movie I saw, or some dream.</span> <span id="s987">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION.</span> <span id="s988">And then I go and fish out the passport, and convince myself that it really was real.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">Q: Alright.</span> <span id="s990">Liane, thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s991">Conclusion of Interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">USHMM Archives RG-50.030*186 page \* arabic45</span></p></body></html>
