telling me your name at the time and now at the present, your date of birth and where you were born.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">A: My name was Bylash Sharf.</span> <span id="s12">I was born in East , March 22, 1929.</span> <span id="s13">Q: Tell me a little bit about your family and your life before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: We were three sisters and a mother and a grandma, and we lived a fairly normal life, a happy life.</span> <span id="s15">I was going to school.</span> <span id="s16">Then when the war broke out, I was going to school in 1939, and in 1940, they started to talk that I wouldn't be able to go to school.</span> <span id="s17">This for me was the biggest blow, because when September came and I looked out of the window and I saw my friends are going to school and I had to remain home, this was a big pain for me.</span> <span id="s18">I could not understand as a little girl why this is happening, and everybody was worrying and there was such a panic and everybody was uncomfortable.</span> <span id="s19">Everybody was fearing, and they were talking that we should run away to Russia and to leave everything behind and my mother said, how can I leave here.</span> <span id="s20">I have the children and the family and whatever I worked all my life for and to run away to Russia, and we didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: Let me ask you a little bit more about .</span> <span id="s22">How large a town it was, what was the size of the Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: The town was a small town.</span> <span id="s24">It was a poor little town.</span> <span id="s25">There were a lot of -- there was a trade like markets, they were on certain days, and there were stores.</span> <span id="s26">People going to school, the daily life, but there were a lot of poor people.</span> <span id="s27">We considered ourselves better off.</span> <span id="s28">We had an uncle in the United States, and he was sending us money and mother took pretty good care of us that we were well dressed and she emphasized that we go to school and to be educated.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: Were there a lot of Jewish people in this town?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: Mostly Jewish people, yes.</span> <span id="s31">I think the population was around 2,000 people.</span> <span id="s32">There were synagogues and Hebrew schools.</span> <span id="s33">Just about the normal Jewish life what it was in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: And your family was traditionally religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: They were religious, but not too religious.</span> <span id="s36">We observed the holidays, and I was raised as a Jewish child, but I was going to -- I didn't go to a Jewish school, so I was mixing a lot with Polish children, and I spoke only Polish at that time, and I was a blonde little girl.</span> <span id="s37">I think that because of being blonde, and I realized that being blonde and speaking well Polish at that time, that I had hoped that this will be an issue that I will be able to survive among other children.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: Did you feel a difference when you were a little kid.</span> <span id="s39">Did you feel that the Polish children didn't like Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: Yes, I felt even before the war started, so when you were crossing from one end to the other town, or you went out of town, someplace with your parent, you were always called "dirty Jew," "dirty Jewish little girl, or you should go to Palestine, you shouldn't stay in Poland why are there so many Jews in Poland?"</span> <span id="s41">This I experienced since I was able to understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: Did you make sense of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: This is how it was.</span> <span id="s44">This is how it was.</span> <span id="s45">It came to a point that when we started to grow up and live a little better, so we had to hide if the Christian children didn't have as much as we had, we had to hide certain things like baked goodies or something like this, not to show off.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: But you had Christian friends from school?</span> <span id="s47">A: Yes, I did have Christian friends, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: Did your mother work?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: We had a little grocery store, so my mother had this and we had about three acres of land, and somebody took care of the land.</span> <span id="s50">We also had a little windmill that it was making flour, you know, so she was constantly busy.</span> <span id="s51">I suppose when my father died and when my grandfather died, my grandma came to live with us and she was the primary person that took care of us, and mother was the breadwinner.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: And your sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: And my sisters, right.</span> <span id="s54">Q: You have a twin sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: I have a twin sister and one almost two years older than I. Q: You were fairly young, but do you remember were there 01:07 political organizations, Zionist groups or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: Yes, they were, but I didn't belong.</span> <span id="s57">I guess I was too young at the time to belong to those</span></p> <p><span id="s58">organizations.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: Were you aware of what was going on in Germany after Hitler came to power or were you too young?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: When the war broke out people started to talk what was going on in German that Hitler came to power and he wants to -- not to kill the Jews that the Jews had to flee Germany or that they were not able to be educated.</span> <span id="s61">We started to read about and hear those stories.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: What is your memory of the beginning of the war?</span> <span id="s63">Did the Germans come into your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: The first, the beginning of the war we were bombed.</span> <span id="s65">There were three bombs that came down on that little town, and some of my relatives were killed.</span> <span id="s66">This was the first initial fear that I experienced.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: This was when?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: September?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: Maybe it was the end of September or October.</span> <span id="s71">I don't recall which month it was, but some of the relatives were killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: We didn't do nothing.</span> <span id="s74">We went out with our lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: Now, did things start changing all of a sudden.</span> <span id="s76">Were there decrees or restrictions on you?</span> <span id="s77">A: I recall that in 1940 -- as I said before Jewish children were not allowed to go to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">But I think the teacher -- not the teacher, he was in charge of the school.</span> <span id="s79">He liked us so much and we were very good students and he kind of overlooked this particular year 1940 and allowed us to go.</span> <span id="s80">But by 1941, we couldn't go to school anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: What else couldn't you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: We were not allowed to go outside the town, and people were just running and bringing in food, you know.</span> <span id="s83">Initially people were gathering in the houses and just listening what to do and how to go on with life.</span> <span id="s84">I had the grandma and I think there was</span></p> <p><span id="s85">01:10 an uncle that had two sons, and the parents were taken away and the two sons came to live with us.</span> <span id="s86">I asked my mother and my two sisters, we asked should we run away to a village to hide someplace and the grandma was ready to go with us.</span> <span id="s87">She was about 74 years old but she had from her son the other two children and she said where will I leave them.</span> <span id="s88">So, she remained.</span> <span id="s89">She remained and at that moment when we were ready to leave the little town for a village they started shooting.</span> <span id="s90">So, we run away quickly.</span> <span id="s91">We didn't know where we were running, but we run into a neighboring village that my mother was dealing with some of the people and we went into hiding into barns.</span> <span id="s92">They took us into barns and we couldn't go out during the day, only at night.</span> <span id="s93">We were there for quite a while and we were going from one family to the other.</span> <span id="s94">They took us for a while and then they said we cannot hold you because at that time, it came out a decree that if the polish people will hold Jews, they will be killed themselves.</span> <span id="s95">Or they gave them a prize, like five pounds of sugar to give out the Jewish person or the Jewish family.</span> <span id="s96">So, they were not able, even my mother's best friends, they said you know I would like to help you maybe by yourself but not with a whole family and you have to leave my premises.</span> <span id="s97">So we were wandering from one family to another.</span> <span id="s98">This was going on maybe more than a year that we were wandering from one family to another and this is how we lived,</span></p> <p><span id="s99">01:12 and then one day my mother went into a family that she was very poor and approximately her children were our age.</span> <span id="s100">How my mother came to the thought to buy or to offer her money she should go to the church and to take out some kind of documents that we should leave the place where we were born or the surrounding villages that they knew us, and she said she dressed us in very long dresses and scarves over the heads and we started to look like 15, 16 year old girls and at that time the Germans were catching people to go to work to Germany.</span> <span id="s101">You know we were working around the Germans, the Gestapo and nobody caught us.</span> <span id="s102">Nobody caught us and we were like disappointed.</span> <span id="s103">So, at one point my mother said she took the train, she brought the kids for the train and we went to Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s105">I want to stop you a moment.</span> <span id="s106">I have some questions.</span> <span id="s107">So, you were hiding out in these barns and fields and did you have to pay these people something to keep you?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: No.</span> <span id="s109">Those were the people that they really tried to help.</span> <span id="s110">They knew my mother very well and they respected her because there were times when they needed help my mother was always there to help them because we were a little bit better financially off than them.</span> <span id="s111">So, but there came a time when the rulings of the Germans was so that they were afraid for their lives.</span> <span id="s112">They were also afraid for their lives and of course they were ones -- I think once I remember that they caught my mother some place and</span></p> <p><span id="s113">01:14 they took away a ring from her and they said if she doesn't give the ring they will bring her to the Gestapo or something like that.</span> <span id="s114">This was the people that she was raised with them.</span> <span id="s115">Some were very vicious and some tried to be very helpful.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: What was their reaction towards the Germans and the Nazis?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: They liked them.</span> <span id="s118">The Germans -- in the beginning they brought in a certain prosperity.</span> <span id="s119">You know they were wheeling and dealing and selling things, I don't recall what kind of merchandise but there was a certain prosperity that arrived with the Germans at that time.</span> <span id="s120">The Polish population, they I would say that they were silently working together with the Germans.</span> <span id="s121">They were indifferent to the Jews.</span> <span id="s122">They wanted to get rid of these Jews.</span> <span id="s123">Poland had three million Jews before the war.</span> <span id="s124">This was the largest Jewish population in Poland, and the Polish people were 75 percent illiterate at that time and the churches had the big influence morally, politically whatnot and they knew, they were told that the Jews killed Jesus and the Jews are non desired to be there.</span> <span id="s125">So, like the rest of the world, they tried to overlook that you are human beings and when you are a Jew you</span></p> <p><span id="s126">01:16 have no right to live.</span> <span id="s127">There were very few of them, that they were real Catholics, and they really suffered from this point, that the people are getting killed like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: Your mother bought these birth certificates or identity --?</span> <span id="s129">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: She got them from these other children?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: From the family the peasants that were there.</span> <span id="s132">She went to the church and she took out a birth certificate for both of us and from her she took her birth certificate from her mother.</span> <span id="s133">My name at that time was Bronislava Bershenska.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: And your older sister was with you also?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: The older sister got the birth certificate from another family and her certificate was altered slightly, but she was traveling with this birth certificate, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: And these birth certificates said that you were catholic?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: That I am a Catholic, yes.</span> <span id="s138">That I am a catholic, so where were we.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: I have just one more question for you and you were going to tell me that you went to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s140">As a young girl was -- at this time was there a sense of adventure about this, or was it frightening, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: Ninety percent was fear, but there was maybe ten percent of adventure.</span> <span id="s142">I think in moment of fear you cannot appreciate life at all.</span> <span id="s143">You were trying to run from one place to another, just to survive, just to sleep over the night, just for another day and to hope that someday this will end.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: Now, your mother's plan was to then go to Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: It wasn't her plan to go to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s146">She wanted to run away from the territories that we were known, or maybe we could be recognized.</span> <span id="s147">So, we went and we bought tickets, she bought tickets for all of us and we went on a train and this train was going to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s148">There was a lot of people that they were smuggling like food and other articles from villages, the food probably mostly, and she started to talk to somebody on the train and she gave an address to a German Volksdeutsche, that they needed help for their homes.</span> <span id="s149">The Volksdeutsche, either she was a Volksdeutsche or he, so they had certain privileges by the German government they received all kinds of goodies.</span> <span id="s150">I don't know if they received any money, but they were especially elite like, and they started to hire help.</span> <span id="s151">So, my mother was hired in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s152">I don't know where we slept.</span> <span id="s153">We probably got up and got off the train at night or in the morning and she got this particular address from the other women.</span> <span id="s154">She was a Volksdeutsche, and he had a wife and four children and she was pregnant with the fifth and she needed help.</span> <span id="s155">So, he hired my mother right away with my twin sister and this lady directed me to my family also a Volksdeutsch family that at the time I think I was approaching 14 already.</span> <span id="s156">This was in 1943.</span> <span id="s157">She hired me to be with her children I should go to park and to play with children or go with children and do for the children things.</span> <span id="s158">So, my main job was to help a little in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s159">I did some marketing and basically to play with the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: Where did they think you came from?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: We told them that we run away from the territory of Lublin, that the Germans chased us out and they took away our possessions and they called us Fluechtlinge (refugees), we (were) chased out</span></p> <p><span id="s162">01:21 from our homes.</span> <span id="s163">And as I said, I emphasized that to speak very well Polish and to be from a small town, we thought we maybe assimilated as other Jews.</span> <span id="s164">In other words, our Polish language was so good that we could pass by that nobody should have a hint that we were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: So, this was in 1943 when you got to Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: We arrived I believe in late 1942 in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s167">It was around November, in the fall, and the Ghetto started to burn the next year, in 1943.</span> <span id="s168">So, I was at that time in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s169">I was going for walks with the children and I have seen Jews going from place to place like hundred Jews together.</span> <span id="s170">They were -- their clothes were torn.</span> <span id="s171">They had the yellow swastikas (means stars of David) on them and they were going from one place to another.</span> <span id="s172">I don't know where they were going, but I stopped and I looked at them and it inserted in me such a pain.</span> <span id="s173">In a way I was happy that I wasn't one of them.</span> <span id="s174">I could have been there among them, but the pain was unbearable.</span> <span id="s175">I turned away and I cried that nobody should see me that I was in such pain.</span> <span id="s176">When I was in this family, I think this was my mother's teaching that we should all go to church.</span> <span id="s177">So, I asked the family where is the nearest church, and I took the children every Sunday, and I dressed them and I went to church every Sunday with them.</span> <span id="s178">Around -- and this</span></p> <p><span id="s179">01:23:30 is how we lived.</span> <span id="s180">My sister had an incident the older one she was walking in the street and a woman from our place recognized her and she started to call her.</span> <span id="s181">So, she run away and we were told that.</span> <span id="s182">So, there was a period of time when we were afraid to walk the streets, you know, how big is whole Poland.</span> <span id="s183">There may be some people coming shopping and being on the street, somebody can recognize.</span> <span id="s184">So every moment, every step that you did, you had a certain fear in yourself.</span> <span id="s185">There was a fear of being recognized.</span> <span id="s186">At one point, my family, the husband of the wife brought up a girl and she had a document, she had dark hair, she looked like a typical Jewish girl, and he started to interrogate her and she had the paper and the seal was like of a penny, or a dime, and he started to question her and he took her away to the Gestapo, and he interrogated her in front of me.</span> <span id="s187">You can imagine how I felt at that time when he interrogated the girl and he did bring her to the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s188">But life was going on until about July when all of a sudden two Gestapos showed up in the</span></p> <p><span id="s189">01:25 apartment and they said to my lady, to the wife of this man, you have here "ein Juedisches Kind", you have a Jewess here.</span> <span id="s190">She looked at him, I have a Jewish girl here?</span> <span id="s191">This is not possible.</span> <span id="s192">And she opened the bedroom and she showed him Hitler.</span> <span id="s193">She said, Hitler is my god.</span> <span id="s194">How would I be able to hold a Jewish girl in my household.</span> <span id="s195">She denied it, and I will never forget this.</span> <span id="s196">I was peeling potatoes at that time, and I became almost stiff, and he was talking to her that this young girl has a mother with another girl, and so she started to swear to them that it's not possible that she's Jewish.</span> <span id="s197">Either her mother or the other sister is Jewish.</span> <span id="s198">She will swear by that.</span> <span id="s199">So, he said tell her and he spoke to me German but I stood with the back, not to understand from Jewish to German is very easily to be understood and I pretended I don't understand.</span> <span id="s200">So, she told me in Polish that I should get dressed and I should go to my mother.</span> <span id="s201">I had no other choice.</span> <span id="s202">It was July.</span> <span id="s203">It was hot, whatever I took and the two Gendarmes took me down to the street and I was going over to my mother and the fear in my mind what my mother will see if she will see me with the two Gendarmes going there.</span> <span id="s204">But while</span></p> <p><span id="s205">01:27: I was walking with them one to the other said, "Ich glaube nicht dass das ist ein Juedisches Kind", in German he said I don't believe that this is a Jewish child and this give me such a strength that I recovered myself of the initial fear and when I walked into my mother, my mother saw me, I saw my mother is pale and is dropping like she's falling and my sister and they start to talk to this man at the time, this wife of his just gave birth to the fifth child, and he happens to be home, the husband and he was a high official in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s206">He was an SS man, you know, he was working in Allee Sucha (??)</span> <span id="s207">.</span> <span id="s208">Allee Sucha was like they would arrest in a criminal court.</span> <span id="s209">Once you go in there, forget about it, nobody comes out.</span> <span id="s210">So, his wife started to cry.</span> <span id="s211">She said how can I be left alone.</span> <span id="s212">She gave birth and on top of it she was very ill I think she had a lung infection, pneumonia, and she was about to die.</span> <span id="s213">I think she eventually did.</span> <span id="s214">And he said to the Germans, to the two SS people, you know, I'll go with them.</span> <span id="s215">I can swear by God that they are not Jewish people, but I'll go with them.</span> <span id="s216">And he emphasized also that they are going to the church with my children and he would never allow himself to lose his high position that the was a high ranking man and to hold Jewish people in his place.</span> <span id="s217">He dressed himself and he went with us to Allee Shukha.</span> <span id="s218">When I arrived there I did not know my older sister was already there.</span> <span id="s219">What happened with my older sister, she said that she's from a village some place, but she had beautiful underwear and she wore glasses and this woman that she worked for, she said, you know, you don't look like a peasant.</span> <span id="s220">You look like you come from a learned family and you wear glasses.</span> <span id="s221">Tell me, I think you are Jewish.</span> <span id="s222">So, my sister didn't say yes or no, but she started to cry.</span> <span id="s223">As soon as she started to</span></p> <p><span id="s224">01:30: cry, they arrested her.</span> <span id="s225">They also took two Germans and they also brought her to Allee Shukha.</span> <span id="s226">When we came there I saw her in a different room with two Germans and I and my mother they took us by train, a trailer car.</span> <span id="s227">I looked at my mother, and I knew that within a couple of hours we will be dead, that we are already in the hands of the SS.</span> <span id="s228">When we arrived there, they started to ask us about religion, if I know the religion the prayers, so I knew the prayers by heart.</span> <span id="s229">We were prepared for that, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: Catholic prayers?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: Yes, catholic prayers.</span> <span id="s232">So, one came out to me and he said in German, tell me you are really a Jewish girl.</span> <span id="s233">You pretend to be a catholic.</span> <span id="s234">I think he started to speak to me in Polish because when they spoke to me German, to us in German in general, we didn't answer.</span> <span id="s235">We were standing like dummies.</span> <span id="s236">So, when the same SS man started to speak Polish I told him, you know, if you will persecute us, do away with us, you will have on your conscience, innocent children.</span> <span id="s237">That's what I answered him.</span> <span id="s238">I was only 14 years old.</span> <span id="s239">I stepped forward and I started to speak to them.</span> <span id="s240">That man that my mother was working for, he also started to tell that this is not possible.</span> <span id="s241">He was arguing with them and give them all the details about us.</span> <span id="s242">So, they asked my mother, they said they will make a deal with my mother.</span> <span id="s243">That they will allow us to leave this place for three weeks and bring my mother's marriage certificate, the death certificate of the</span></p> <p><span id="s244">01:32: father, the other documents which I needed, you know, and at that time in Poland I think I already had a Kennkarte and an Arbeitskarte, you know, so they released us, and I came back to the same family.</span> <span id="s245">She was glad to see me back, so did the husband of the sick woman glad to see mother back, also.</span> <span id="s246">And my older sister had no place to go because this woman that called the SS didn't want her anymore.</span> <span id="s247">So, she was a couple days with me.</span> <span id="s248">I went down and bought a paper.</span> <span id="s249">Imagine that at 14 years old, and looking for a job outside Warsaw.</span> <span id="s250">So, there was a farmer that wanted help, so we put my sister on the train and with the address of that farmer, and my younger sister went with her there and she remained over there.</span> <span id="s251">And the younger sister came back and within those three weeks that we were supposed to deliver all the papers and identify ourselves, we started to plan to run away.</span> <span id="s252">There was no other choice, just to leave the place.</span> <span id="s253">As ill as she was, my mother's lady, she was a very fine woman, but I guess survival is over taken everything and you run like animals at that time, and we started to make plans that one day</span></p> <p><span id="s254">01:34: we will meet at the main station and take a train and again to go into a place or maybe we will ask somebody where we will be able to work, or maybe we'll go to the Russian border and maybe we will be across the border to go to Russian that we shouldn't be under the German occupation.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: Before you go any further, I want to ask you a couple more questions about Warsaw.</span> <span id="s256">A: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: You said that you walked this park and you saw the Ghetto and people coming from the Ghetto, did you have any contact with those people?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: When the Warsaw Ghetto uprising took place in April of '43, what did you see, what were people talking about on the outside?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: The Jews are burning.</span> <span id="s261">The Jews are burning.</span> <span id="s262">The feathers were flying all over Warsaw, -- feathers, smoke, a smell.</span> <span id="s263">We knew that the Jews are burning in the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s264">But I couldn't do nothing.</span> <span id="s265">I had no contact, and I would be afraid frankly to go over and to look.</span> <span id="s266">I knew I would lose my life.</span> <span id="s267">We were hiding away, but at the same time, this time I think already we knew and the papers were writing that Stalingrad has fallen.</span> <span id="s268">Stalingrad has fallen and the Germans are receding back.</span> <span id="s269">That they didn't succeed to take Moscow.</span> <span id="s270">The Germans - - when I was still in Warsaw, the Germans had black flags.</span> <span id="s271">When they lost Stalingrad</span></p> <p><span id="s272">01:36:30 they put out that this was the saddest day for them.</span> <span id="s273">The military people were writing articles that this is the worst day for them, that they lost Stalingrad.</span> <span id="s274">Privately everybody knew that once they lost Stalingrad and they started around back, that they would lose the war.</span> <span id="s275">And everybody hoped that there would come a day that we will be liberated.</span> <span id="s276">And you only lived with one thought in mind, to live one day longer than Hitler, and then to die.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: So you had a lot of access to what the German people, or the Polish people were thinking on the other side of the wall?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: Yes, I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: Anything else you can remember in terms of their attitude?</span> <span id="s280">They didn't care whether the Ghetto is burning or did they talk about the camps or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: You see, I was with that Volksdeutsche family.</span> <span id="s282">They were against Polish people and they were against Jews.</span> <span id="s283">I was too young I guess to go into politics with adults and I tried to avoid even to have friends.</span> <span id="s284">I started to develop a young little lady and boys started to try to talk to me.</span> <span id="s285">I was bowing my head and I walked away.</span> <span id="s286">I was afraid to talk to them.</span> <span id="s287">So, I was too afraid to talk to anybody except what I was reading in the papers.</span> <span id="s288">I was very much interested in what is going on in the world, and I bought the Polish papers which I was able to read and whatever I could make out as a 14 years old and to understand what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: So, you had information on the war and what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: Yes, cover to end, prior that I left Warsaw, the Russians were bombarding already Warsaw.</span> <span id="s291">So, even that I knew that the bomb may hit, the cellar that I was sitting, I was going down with the children to those bunkers, you know, against the bombs, I was happy that the Russians are flying in the air over Warsaw and they are trying to fight the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: Your family had a private bunker?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: In each house at that time had a bunker.</span> <span id="s294">They had bunkers, 01:39: yes.</span> <span id="s295">So, they were like sirens, everybody was running to the bunker.</span> <span id="s296">In my heart, I was very happy that even if I get killed that I knew it was a Russian bomb, not a German bomb.</span> <span id="s297">I would think it was rather that.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: How much contact did you have with your mother and your sisters while you were in Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: Maybe twice a week, we met in the parks and we talked.</span> <span id="s300">We talked only on the outside about private matters about running away or something like that.</span> <span id="s301">Mother always said not to give way that we should hold up and maybe in the near future the war will end and we will survive the war and this was our daily hope.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: It must have been comforting that your mother was nearby?</span> <span id="s303">A: Of course, by myself it would be much harder.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: You don't think your family ever suspected?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: The family of me, that I am a Jewish child?</span> <span id="s306">I think at one time she said that I have a Jewish head on my shoulders.</span> <span id="s307">Yes.</span> <span id="s308">So, let me continue with what happened.</span> <span id="s309">I saw that Warsaw was burning and we had to run away.</span> <span id="s310">We went on the main station and we bought tickets and we were going further.</span> <span id="s311">We were traveling about eight hours by train.</span> <span id="s312">The older sister was already sent away to a farm near Warsaw, so we knew where she is but where we were going to be she wouldn't know, but we said that we will get in touch with her.</span> <span id="s313">We were traveling about eight hours.</span> <span id="s314">We were already tired and exhausted and on the train they said it's not possible to in Russian the border, it's not feasible because if they catch you on the border right away they will destroy us.</span> <span id="s315">So, we came off the train in a small village and we went to a family and asked for food.</span> <span id="s316">They gave us food and they asked who we are.</span> <span id="s317">At that time I think I told you I had an Arbeitskarte, I was no more a Jewish girl and my mother also had this document and I felt a little more secure with this document.</span> <span id="s318">She wouldn't let us to sleep in that house.</span> <span id="s319">We had to go to a superior of this little village to allow us to sleep there, and we went there in person and we presented our documentation what we had and he gave us permission to remain in the village.</span> <span id="s320">So, the first thing they said, could you work for me.</span> <span id="s321">I said yes, I can remain.</span> <span id="s322">I said what will be with my mother with my sister.</span> <span id="s323">She said, stay a week with us and we will find her something.</span> <span id="s324">So, I think I am talking about myself a lot, but this is true.</span> <span id="s325">I was going for the water, in the villages they didn't have yet water at that time in the houses so they had the wells, and somebody was passing by and I walked over and I said do you know somebody need help.</span> <span id="s326">My mother is looking for work.</span> <span id="s327">She said yes, there is a man that took over like a 40 or 50 acres of land and he needs some help in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s328">Do you think your mother would be willing to go there to take this job.</span> <span id="s329">I said yes, just give me the address.</span> <span id="s330">So, she gave me the address and the next day my mother and my sister went the eight kilometer, which was about four miles.</span> <span id="s331">He was a single man.</span> <span id="s332">He had a lot of step.</span> <span id="s333">It was I don't know how you should call it.</span> <span id="s334">He was in charge of a large</span></p> <p><span id="s335">01:44: piece of land, a big landowner.</span> <span id="s336">When my mother went there, he hired her right away, so she packed the little stuff that she had and she went away and I was very happy.</span> <span id="s337">I remained with this family for about another two, three weeks and they came an order from the Germans that from each family somebody has to go to work in the fields or somebody to collect potatoes or other -- you know you take down from the fields.</span> <span id="s338">I don't know how to express myself.</span> <span id="s339">And I went to work and they put a sack of potatoes on my back and I fell right away, and I saw that I couldn't work.</span> <span id="s340">I came home crying.</span> <span id="s341">I said I cannot go to work anymore.</span> <span id="s342">So, they gave me some other work, you know, in the garden a little fields, and I went with a cow here and there, and I said I cannot stay here.</span> <span id="s343">I have to go closer to where my mother is.</span> <span id="s344">So, I went around four kilometers and I was looking around, and I came in.</span> <span id="s345">It was a little town and it's called Sokolov ?</span> <span id="s346">Polaski.</span> <span id="s347">It wasn't far away from this place, and I went to a little store and I said do you have some work for me?</span> <span id="s348">She said what can you do?</span> <span id="s349">I said I can help you with whatever you like.</span> <span id="s350">I will do anything you will ask me to.</span> <span id="s351">So, she was having like a little bar, you know, and she was using me to bring in food or a</span></p> <p><span id="s352">01:46: little whiskey or something to carry into that little store and to help to serve the tables.</span> <span id="s353">So, I was there, and the store was like about two miles away from her home.</span> <span id="s354">She took me home and she didn't pay me, but I had food and I had a bed.</span> <span id="s355">She was also a woman by herself and she had an adopted daughter.</span> <span id="s356">She was also slaughtering pigs and making delis and she was selling that.</span> <span id="s357">She took me to the market to buy pigs and I fell right into this family and I was doing everything together.</span> <span id="s358">We went together to buy those pigs for the market and the illegal whiskey she was buying and selling and she was making a lot of money.</span> <span id="s359">The whole police station was there and I felt I am very secure there.</span> <span id="s360">She also had some a cow and some other things that had to be looked after and I did all of that.</span> <span id="s361">At one point, she said to me, you know you really have a Jewish head on her shoulder.</span> <span id="s362">When she told me that, I almost died inside myself.</span> <span id="s363">This was around December, the holidays came over and I had to look that everything I should do correctly when the holiday are there, and behave like a real Christian.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: A Jewish head, what did she mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: I was too smart.</span> <span id="s366">I was so smart that I am thinking like a 01:48: real Jew.</span> <span id="s367">So, she said this Easter you will go with me to the church and you will do the confession in front of a priest.</span> <span id="s368">When she told me that I almost died inside.</span> <span id="s369">I said how will I be able to do that?</span> <span id="s370">I went to the church.</span> <span id="s371">I was hiding someplace in the corner.</span> <span id="s372">I said the prayer, whatever I said, nobody was listening to me if I said correctly or not, and here I will have to stand in front of a priest and to say all those prayers, and she was standing right behind my back.</span> <span id="s373">I kneeled down -- again, I brought myself the catechism, this is a religious book, and there was no electricity and I bought candles, and where I took the money from the candles I don't recall, and at night I was learning the catechism from the beginning to the end.</span> <span id="s374">And I must say I had a terrific head.</span> <span id="s375">I had a good memory.</span> <span id="s376">I don't know if this was out of necessity or I was young or I was brilliant, and I knew all those prayers.</span> <span id="s377">So, the holidays came closer and I prepared myself like every night and when she went to sleep I put on the candle and I was studying and I went in front of the priest and I kneeled down and I said you have to unburden yourself with all the sins that you committed during the year, and I was I think past 14 at that time, and I really was an innocent child, what could I have sinned.</span> <span id="s378">You know what I told the priest?</span> <span id="s379">That I was saying bad things about my mother which wasn't true, but I had nothing else to say.</span> <span id="s380">He looked at me and he saw such a young face and he gave me a prayer 30 times to say I should cleanse myself with those prayers and I went to the corner of the church and I said all the prayers, and I came out of the church and I was very, very relieved.</span> <span id="s381">Believe me, since then she never said that I had a Jewish head on my shoulders.</span> <span id="s382">This was around Easter time.</span> <span id="s383">I think around end of June I started to see Russian soldiers coming in, and they said that the Germans are running away already from the territories that I was there, but I couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s384">They were dirty, they were torn.</span> <span id="s385">The uniforms that they wore they looked like they run away from concentration camps themselves.</span> <span id="s386">It didn't look to me like military people.</span> <span id="s387">I was sitting quiet but I was running over to my mother and I said you know I think the Germans are going.</span> <span id="s388">We have already the Russians.</span> <span id="s389">She said be quiet and sit still and don't talk to nobody.</span> <span id="s390">We have to see and wait what will go on.</span> <span id="s391">Then in August I don't know if I heard from people or papers, I saw that Lublin is already free.</span> <span id="s392">Lublin is freed by the Russian people.</span> <span id="s393">I went again to tell my mother this news, and she started -- I started to feel like you know she was stepping on me and I was doing a lot of chores and no matter what I did when she was killing a pig she needed maybe 50 pails of water and I had to carry it by myself and I just felt the evenings that I couldn't do this any more.</span> <span id="s394">She started to get very rude and I had the sense of feeling that I was already liberated in a way.</span> <span id="s395">The Russians are here already why should I perform such work and she doesn't deserve it.</span> <span id="s396">So, I went to my mother and I told her that I'm going to leave this lady because she became unbearable to me.</span> <span id="s397">She said sit another couple of months and we'll see what will</span></p> <p><span id="s398">01:53 develop.</span> <span id="s399">But I packed myself up.</span> <span id="s400">I can only tell you that I had only one pair of shoes and one little underwear, my whole thing was a little package, and I took this package one day and I said to mother I arrived at mother's place and said you can kill me here.</span> <span id="s401">I am not going back to that woman.</span> <span id="s402">She's a real witch, and I don't want to suffer any more.</span> <span id="s403">My clothes started to fall apart.</span> <span id="s404">You know as you grow you start to expand so I started to get holes in my clothes and she wouldn't buy me nothing.</span> <span id="s405">There was a certain resentment and anger, so I was working only for the food.</span> <span id="s406">But really the liberation and knowing that the Germans are going, I wanted to see what will be next.</span> <span id="s407">And when I said to my mother that even if she'll kill me, I'm not going back to the woman, she had no choice.</span> <span id="s408">So, she said okay you will sleep here.</span> <span id="s409">The next day I walked out into the garden and there were a lot of -- at this Volksdeutsch, the man that my mother worked for, he run away already.</span> <span id="s410">There was no supervision over nobody, over the food that they have grown it was just like everybody lived by themselves.</span> <span id="s411">I met a man, listen to that, and he was an adult, I was at the time already close to 15, and he took me aside in the garden and he said I suspect that you are a Jewish girl and your mother too, with the other sister.</span> <span id="s412">I can tell you that in Lublin there is already the Jewish committee from America that they came and they established, and you are too young to live here in the villages and you will ruin yourselves.</span> <span id="s413">Go to Lublin and there will be new hope for you.</span> <span id="s414">I was afraid to tell my mother.</span> <span id="s415">I couldn't believe my ears what he told me.</span> <span id="s416">I didn't know if he wants to convince me that you know that I'm Jewish that I should confess or he really wants to help me.</span> <span id="s417">So, I didn't tell my mother that this guy spoke to me.</span> <span id="s418">But I told my mother that I heard that the Lublin there are Jews already, that they are congregating the old survivors are there, that they are running to Lublin.</span> <span id="s419">So, she said let's sit another couple of</span></p> <p><span id="s420">01:56: months.</span> <span id="s421">Don't talk to nobody that you are Jewish and we'll see what will happen.</span> <span id="s422">She was pulling time.</span> <span id="s423">She wanted to reassure herself that we shouldn't be too hasty to make a step forward that we shouldn't get lost.</span> <span id="s424">You know what I did.</span> <span id="s425">Once a Russian soldier spoke to me and I asked him if he can bring me to Lublin and he said he's going in that direction&gt; I was fearless, and I said I'll go and I'll take a look by myself.</span> <span id="s426">I went on a big truck.</span> <span id="s427">He didn't touch me, you know I didn't think of it that he will abuse me or rape me or something like that.</span> <span id="s428">Somehow I was so innocent and I believed in the goodness of the people that they liberated me that he cannot do nothing wrong to me.</span> <span id="s429">I came to Lublin and I go on the street and I looked at someone that look to me like a Jewish person and I asked him in Polish do you know where the Jewish Gemeinde is here?</span> <span id="s430">So, he asked you are you Amkho.</span> <span id="s431">Amkho was Jewish code word for being Jewish.</span> <span id="s432">I couldn't answer him in the Jewish language because my tongue just couldn't speak any more Jewish.</span> <span id="s433">I told him in Polish that yes I am a Jewish girl.</span> <span id="s434">That I am one of the survivors and I am looking for the Gemeinde.</span> <span id="s435">When I came there, they met me there and they tried to talk to me and I told them that I have a mother left near Sokolove?</span> <span id="s436">Polaski, and he said that I should bring her here with my sister and they will be maybe able to give us some lodging and we will be able to start to live as Jews again.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: So, you arrived in Lublin and who are these people that you met?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: You know when we arrived in Lublin, they had a place they called Dom Peretz.</span> <span id="s441">A Peretz was a famous scholar [writer] or I think that was probably related with the history of Palestine before the war, so there was such a home like an organization where they met.</span> <span id="s442">It was called Dom Peretza, or the House of Peretz.</span> <span id="s443">People went there daily to meet other people and to hear what is going on, just to communicate and how to live and how to organize our lives.</span> <span id="s444">So, my mother met there people that she knew from before the war that they had already an apartment there and they recommended a small apartment on Lubartovska 18 in Lublin.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">02:03:</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: I think we're skipping something.</span> <span id="s447">If I remember when we stopped before you were there by yourself.</span> <span id="s448">Your mother wasn't there yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: And also, these people you met with, were they part of some international committee, the people in charge?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: I don't know if they were international committee, probably some.</span> <span id="s452">The leaders were, but they started probably to employ people that survived or were capable or giving or lending help.</span> <span id="s453">They were partisans that had survived and I think that the Russians, the military was also involved to help the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s454">I told you that I arrived in Poland by myself, right.</span> <span id="s455">I went back, and it took me maybe four weeks to convince my mother she should come with me to Lublin.</span> <span id="s456">Finally she did.</span> <span id="s457">So, she packed, not with everything, but she took a little belongings and you know what happened?</span> <span id="s458">We went on the train to Lublin.</span> <span id="s459">I went down to ask really the directions is this train is going to Lublin, the train started to go and my mother went there and I remained on the station by myself.</span> <span id="s460">So, I took the next train and then I went to that Gemeinde, and I met my mother over there, and I think it was with my twin sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: And your other sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: I skipped this part.</span> <span id="s463">You see when we were liberated already and I ran away from that lady and I didn't want to work with her, so and we were talking about Lublin so my mother took my twin sister and she bought her a ticket to go to the older sister where she was in Warsaw, and this is for the first time that she knew that we were alive and that she is alive and she was there and we brought her to us where we were together where my mother was when everybody was running away.</span> <span id="s464">I'm telling you there was food, plenty of everything because there was nobody to take charge so my mother was the whole housekeeper there.</span> <span id="s465">So, my sister came there too, and then all of us we proceeded to Lublin.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">02:06:</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: When you got Lublin, you found an apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: Somebody recommended my mother found friends there from the prewar from a nearby town that they knew her that they already had an apartment and they recommended.</span> <span id="s469">It was a two or three room apartment, but you know they, the committee, put in maybe ten people into it.</span> <span id="s470">There were four girls in one room and the other ones were in the other place, but it was fine as long as there was a floor to put our heads, we were happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: Who were alot of these other Jewish people who were in this area what were they like?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Where had they been?</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: There were a lot from the woods.</span> <span id="s474">They came out from the woods, the partisans, a lot of them they came out and also from hiding.</span> <span id="s475">My step father, that my mother married in 1945 he was in Sobibor, in the uprising of the Sobibor [camp].</span> <span id="s476">You probably heard about it.</span> <span id="s477">He was one of the members that they tried to get rid of the Germans at that time and run away, but unfortunately about 600 people remained the people because the top people that were the guards, the top of the building, they couldn't reach them and they had the ammunition they were shooting from there all around.</span> <span id="s478">So, they almost killed all the 600 Jews.</span> <span id="s479">I think after the war from the 600 that were supposed to be liberated maybe 30 survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: Were there any people there from Maidanek?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: At that time, maybe not yet, not yet.</span> <span id="s482">You know when I came to Lublin basically the people were there that survived the Polish territory.</span> <span id="s483">The partisans were hidden by the peasants or wherever.</span> <span id="s484">This was in 1944, but in 1945 when the concentration camps were liberated, I started to see those people from the concentration camps, those skeletons I started to see, and I just couldn't believe it that something like this exists because I was never exposed to something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: Hadn't you had any idea what was going on in other parts when you were in hiding?</span> <span id="s486">Did you know anything about what was happening to the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: No.</span> <span id="s488">No, I didn't know about the concentration camps at all.</span> <span id="s489">I knew they were being killed, but how and what and I couldn't perceive in my head you know to understand that something like this existed.</span> <span id="s490">In fact, in 1983 I was in Warsaw and this was for the opening of the synagogue in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s491">There was a lot of Jews coming from all over the world and I went just to be there as a survivor -- I lost my thought -- and I went for the first time they took us to Oswiecim, and they took us to Treblinka, and all those things.</span> <span id="s492">This is the first time that I had ever seen something like that.</span> <span id="s493">I have seen those glasses, the luggage and the shoes and all those clothes over there and the hair what I have seen.</span> <span id="s494">I almost fainted.</span> <span id="s495">I have never seen while I was living in Poland in the Polish territory I was fortunate enough not to be exposed to those things.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: So, I'll let you continue.</span> <span id="s497">We're in Lublin, you found a place with some other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">What was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: Well, we started to live rather well and together with a family.</span> <span id="s500">We were able I don't know how we got our food.</span> <span id="s501">I think we got the help from that Jewish Gemeinde, and also my mother remarried in 1945 a man that she knew from before the war.</span> <span id="s502">He was a landowner and he sold some of his land and he started wheeling and dealing and he already was making business and there wasn't any lack of food or anything in the house in 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Around February 1945 I started to inquire about school.</span> <span id="s504">I went to the sixth grade in February and by June I had a certificate that I finished six classes of elementary school.</span> <span id="s505">With that in the fall I started to go to a higher education, a gymnasium.</span> <span id="s506">My mother wanted that we should go to a gymnasium.</span> <span id="s507">So, I needed seven classes of public school to enter the second -- the second class of gymnasium and I didn't have this so I went to the Jewish Gemeinde and they gave me a paper that I finished seven classes.</span> <span id="s508">It wasn't real, but somehow I wanted just to be there for a higher education.</span> <span id="s509">But you know I was sitting and when they started to teach algebra and history and geography which was forbidden even in that time at Poland when I was in the fourth grade, I didn't have the slightest idea of what a map was looking and I didn't know what algebra meant.</span> <span id="s510">I thought I was such a brilliant girl and all of a sudden I am standing in front of a professor and he's talking to me and explaining and I just couldn't follow.</span> <span id="s511">So, I went home crying and I said I am not going to school.</span> <span id="s512">I am not prepared.</span> <span id="s513">I'm not going to be a dummy there.</span> <span id="s514">She was a clever woman and she said we'll give you some help and she brought in help, tutors and I needed help in mathematics, this was a high education in mathematics already.</span> <span id="s515">Of course in English, my English was not on level and other areas.</span> <span id="s516">So, for three months the tutors came in and helped me to the level that I was supposed to be, and after three months I had the exam in the school and I achieved the highest report card.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: This was Jewish school?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: No, this was a general gymnasium.</span> <span id="s519">But you know what happened later?</span> <span id="s520">The first month they selected me I should be the president of the class.</span> <span id="s521">The second month somehow they got to know that I was a Jewish girl, they took me away my position.</span> <span id="s522">They didn't like that and on top of it all we used to where a uniform, black uniforms and white collars and on the back they wrote you are a dirty Jewish girl.</span> <span id="s523">This was after the liberation in 1945 or maybe beginning of 1946.</span> <span id="s524">In 1946 I don't know if you</span></p> <p><span id="s525">02:15 remember a lot of Jews were returning from Russia that run away from Poland to Russia and then they came back home and those were the ones that were traveling by trains they were pulled down.</span> <span id="s526">There were two parties in Poland at that time.</span> <span id="s527">It was Army of Krajowa (AK)and it was the communist the Army of KKR was against the communist and the Jews went with KKR.</span> <span id="s528">The working together against the German government and because of that the AK which was the army which was against the Jews, and they were pulling down, in 1946 they were pulling down the Jews from the trains and killing them.</span> <span id="s529">So, they started to get againt such anti semitism so some tried to run away, and at that time the displaced camps opened in Germany already and everybody was telling us that if you go to Germany to displaced camps, you'll be able to immigrate to the United States.</span> <span id="s530">This was everybody's dream, to run away to a free country not to be persecuted any more.</span> <span id="s531">So, one day I came back from school.</span> <span id="s532">This was again around Easter holidays and we had the Shochet, do you know Shochet, kill chickens for the holidays for the Jews to have kosher meat.</span> <span id="s533">I come from school as a liberated, feeling liberated after such a war, you know surviving Hitler and all of a sudden in the hallways they are talking about the Jews killed a Polish child and there were about 200 people standing in that hall entering that house where I was living.</span> <span id="s534">When I heard that I said it's time to leave Poland.</span> <span id="s535">No more Poland.</span> <span id="s536">I have to get away from there.</span> <span id="s537">Of course I knew already my husband, my future husband.</span> <span id="s538">I was going out with that young man.</span> <span id="s539">I think my older sister got engaged also to a man that he came from Russia with the Sikorski Army.</span> <span id="s540">Maybe you know about this that there was</span></p> <p><span id="s541">02:18: Sikorsrki Army.</span> <span id="s542">He came back from Russia and he was in uniform as a military man and she got engaged to him and she left in February in 1946 to Germany to West Berlin, and I wanted also to go.</span> <span id="s543">I didn't want to stay in Poland especially after this incident when I came from school and they said that the Jews killed a Polish child for Matza.</span> <span id="s544">So, I made my business and I made up at that time to leave.</span> <span id="s545">Either my mother will allow me or not allow me to go, so I told my mother and she said of course I cannot go.</span> <span id="s546">I was only 17.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Yes I was 17 and she said you will go with that young man?</span> <span id="s548">I said yes I will go with that man.</span> <span id="s549">She said you are not married, you cannot go.</span> <span id="s550">So, I said so I'll marry him and then I'll go.</span> <span id="s551">So, she called up a couple of people witnesses and they put some liquor on the table and some cookies and candies and this was the whole wedding and the same night I went away to Germany.</span> <span id="s552">Not to Germany, I went to Breslau and I was there a couple of months with my husband.</span> <span id="s553">I married him already, and I became pregnant and the Jewish organization, the underground organization from Israel started to work to bring out as many Jews from Poland as they could.</span> <span id="s554">I think they approached us and we said yes and then one day they picked us up in the truck and we were crossing the Czechoslovakian border to Austria and as I said I was pregnant already.</span> <span id="s555">I was there six weeks and such a it was like a military barracks.</span> <span id="s556">This was Eichstadt near</span></p> <p><span id="s557">02:20:30 Munich, and I was there until my son was born.</span> <span id="s558">This was from November in 1946 until May in 1947, so I was in that Eichstadt camp, and my sister went from Berlin she went into Salsheim.</span> <span id="s559">They brought her into Salsheim near Frankfurt am Main.</span> <span id="s560">There was also a DP camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: Let me just ask you about the first camp.</span> <span id="s562">What were the living conditions like?</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: It was terrible.</span> <span id="s564">Maybe ten women had to cook on the one little stove.</span> <span id="s565">There was no running water.</span> <span id="s566">When I gave birth, I went to a military hospital and of course they said a child is having a child and they gave me a military blanket and what kind of a dish something you know that it looked like I should be able to bathe the child, and I went back to this barrack.</span> <span id="s567">The barrack was divided with pieces of wood.</span> <span id="s568">When this wood dried out everybody was looking into the other, like you know to the bedrooms.</span> <span id="s569">It was terrible, the living conditions were terrible.</span> <span id="s570">They were like animals.</span> <span id="s571">Those people that came out from the concentration camps they behaved like animals.</span> <span id="s572">They grabbed away everything that you had.</span> <span id="s573">They had no manners.</span> <span id="s574">They were so...you know I lived through certain fear but I had a mother to guide me and I didn't see those barbaric things.</span> <span id="s575">They came out and they were literally stepping over dead bodies, so they didn't care if I was standing in the line for my milk or something or the portions to get my food so they pushed me and I was nine months pregnant or something like that.</span> <span id="s576">It was really unbearable.</span> <span id="s577">I was rather depressed because I started to look back when I was with my mother and I was really -- I was with other people that they knew me and they treated me very well as a human being.</span> <span id="s578">Here in the displaced camp I started to feel very</span></p> <p><span id="s579">02:23: very low, very depressed.</span> <span id="s580">Also, I missed home, you know.</span> <span id="s581">I left my twin sister and being in a strange place in a strange country and I didn't know what my future was holding for me and having a small child.</span> <span id="s582">There was no diapers, there was no food for the baby, very little.</span> <span id="s583">I had to stand in line for every piece of food that I was getting.</span> <span id="s584">So, it was very bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: This camp was run by the U.S. military?</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s587">It was the -- the barracks were U.S. military.</span> <span id="s588">I think it was also run by the UNRRA.</span> <span id="s589">The UNRRA was running it.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: Did you befriend any of these people from the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: Yes, I did.</span> <span id="s592">Some of them I befriended but my aim was to go to my sister where she was in Saltzheim and she gave birth also to a child at that time and we wanted to be together so they saw to it that I should have a room.</span> <span id="s593">It was a little house like in each house was a family so I came there.</span> <span id="s594">We were there in Salzheim about seven months and they discontinued this displaced -- the DP camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: What was it like up there?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: We lived rather well.</span> <span id="s597">We didn't have good facilities, like one room was for every family.</span> <span id="s598">It was a little house we took away from the Germans -- I don't know if they took away or the Germans left, what facilities we had one room per family.</span> <span id="s599">There was also no water, no running water.</span> <span id="s600">I think there was electricity, but in general it was not bad.</span> <span id="s601">We didn't have to pay rent and we had portions of food.</span> <span id="s602">We got some clothes, so as young people I think we accepted this is not bad at all, but let's wait until we get to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: Was your husband working there or anything?</span> <span id="s604">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: Were there activities?</span> <span id="s606">Were there cultural things?</span> <span id="s607">Did they start training?</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: They started to train some of the young people, you know like to teach them how to sew and other trades.</span> <span id="s609">I think they brought in the old to teach some trade to the people, but I didn't because I had a small child.</span> <span id="s610">My husband I think he was doing some dealing and wheeling, like buying a few pounds of coffee and selling and exchanging for some other food.</span> <span id="s611">This was his activities.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: What about the Jewish religion?</span> <span id="s613">Did you observe any of the holidays or the Sabbath or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: None of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: No.</span> <span id="s617">This was far away.</span> <span id="s618">I don't recall even in Frankfurt when we arrived already everybody was a little bit on their feet and they started to live a more normal life that we started to go to synagogues.</span> <span id="s619">I don't recall it no.</span> <span id="s620">I was living among the Germans.</span> <span id="s621">I started to speak fluently German and by the end, the last eight months I even hired help for my child because I really didn't know if I was raising him properly or not.</span> <span id="s622">I did what nature told me to do, and when my husband started to deal a</span></p> <p><span id="s623">02:27:30 little more and he was selling those foods and we had a little more money, I hired -- she was a nurse.</span> <span id="s624">Actually she was a nurse.</span> <span id="s625">And at that time, I started to breath a little easier.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: Your mother was still where?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: My mother came already.</span> <span id="s628">She left in 1948 and she came to the United States and she was held over in Ellis Island.</span> <span id="s629">Supposedly she didn't know that those papers were illegal and they wanted them to return to go back to Poland or there was at that time there was a quota to go to Cuba.</span> <span id="s630">My mother had a brother here and her whole hope was to come here to see her brother but prior to her arrival he died.</span> <span id="s631">So, she was so disappointed that she wanted to go back to Poland, and the brother's children they tried to help her.</span> <span id="s632">They hired an attorney and she was sitting on Ellis Island for six weeks and she made a decision not to stay in the United States and not to go back to Poland but to go to Cuba.</span> <span id="s633">Actually, the attorneys I think advised her to go to Cuba, that she will stay for a short time.</span> <span id="s634">I think it was the attorney's decision that they should have them in Cuba and from Cuba they will be able to come to the United States in a very short time, but it took them two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">When they arrived in Cuba the living condition was also very, very poor where in Poland right after the war when my mother remarried that Mr. Mermelstein(?)</span> <span id="s636">, he came from a very wealthy family and he sold off some land so he considered himself a wealthy guy, and they lived rather well.</span> <span id="s637">In Cuba they weren't allowed to work.</span> <span id="s638">Immigrants weren't allowed to work and my mother was so proud that there were kitchens that you could eat free food, so she went a couple times and when she got to know that this was charity she was starving to death and she wouldn't go.</span> <span id="s639">She was a very proud woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">02:30</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q: What was your situation?</span> <span id="s642">How long did you stay in the Frankfurt area and how difficult was it for you to come over here?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: Well, we stayed there until we had the notices to come to the consulate and prepare ourselves for the immigration to the United States.</span> <span id="s644">I immigrated to the United States.</span> <span id="s645">Our arrival was May 9 in 1950.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: I want to back up a little bit because you spent several years pretending you weren't Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: And you had to learn the catholic prayers but I'm sure there were other things that you had to do to make sure you weren't caught.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: That I wasn't caught, I don't recall what other things I could do except to go to the church and to act as a Christian, and you almost become a Christian.</span> <span id="s650">You become -- you don't feel Jewish after a while, except mentally that I felt that I am Jewish, that I was born Jewish.</span> <span id="s651">But in my speech the knowledge of the Polish language was typical of a Polish little girl.</span> <span id="s652">There were moments I'm sure that I forgot that I am a Jewish girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: Were there things that you had to do so you wouldn't give yourself a way.</span> <span id="s654">Were there ways you need to act or do things a certain way?</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: I was afraid to get close to a friend.</span> <span id="s656">I remember a young boy started to smile at me for instance, and he wanted just to talk to me and I run away from him.</span> <span id="s657">I was running away from everybody that wanted to be close to me except my mother and my sisters.</span> <span id="s658">I was afraid to be close.</span> <span id="s659">I shouldn't talk to them.</span> <span id="s660">I shouldn't give away myself.</span> <span id="s661">So, I was always on the guard.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q: Were there any customs that were different for catholics than Jews that you had to pay attention to, any lifestyle things?</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: Life styles, I couldn't eat for instance a meal like pig meat, how you call it, pork, and the first time they gave me pork</span></p> <p><span id="s664">02:33 with potatoes I couldn't tell them that I don't eat them, and I was hungry.</span> <span id="s665">But when I ate it, I threw it up and I pretended to be ill at the time.</span> <span id="s666">I didn't tell them that I threw it up because it was pork.</span> <span id="s667">So, those were the things that in the beginning that it wasn't acceptable for me, but I had to hide my feelings, how I feel and not to give myself away.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: Was it important that you worked, you were just a kid basically?</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: I was a kid.</span> <span id="s670">It was important, of course it helped me mentally to be with somebody, but there was a rule in Poland at that time that the Jewish family cannot live together.</span> <span id="s671">This was a rule that came out I believe in late 1941 that the Jewish family cannot -- they started to disperse and there was a time that you could stay with other Polish people but not as a family together.</span> <span id="s672">So, to work for somebody was a basic survival for food and lodging.</span> <span id="s673">This is the only way that I could survive.</span> <span id="s674">I couldn't stay with my mother.</span> <span id="s675">I couldn't have my own room and I wasn't able to take care of myself.</span> <span id="s676">I had to be with another family to -- this was only through my work and ability whatever I could do to help those families this capacity of course I wasn't paid much, almost nothing.</span> <span id="s677">When they gave me a piece of clothes, I was very grateful.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: But you couldn't have stayed together as a Polish family?</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: No, no this was too dangerous.</span> <span id="s680">And where would my mother get the income?</span> <span id="s681">We lost our house, the piece of land -- we had about three acres of land.</span> <span id="s682">We had like a grocery store and we had milk, you know we lost all of that.</span> <span id="s683">This was taken away from us.</span> <span id="s684">So, what were the other resources to survive, then to work or stay with other families.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: Did you ever have a hiding place of something that in case you were caught you would go to?</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: Prior that I arrived in Warsaw and we went on that journey to be caught as a Polish woman and to go into the Warsaw to travel to Warsaw we were hidden in barns, in barns the people</span></p> <p><span id="s687">02:36 knew that we were there.</span> <span id="s688">They brought us the food at night.</span> <span id="s689">You couldn't go to the toilet the whole day.</span> <span id="s690">You had to wait until it got dark.</span> <span id="s691">So, this was the only times that we were hidden.</span> <span id="s692">Each time a couple of weeks with another family and this was going on for like a year.</span> <span id="s693">This was the most painful experience because the whole day you had to be hiding.</span> <span id="s694">Only at night could you be free to go to the bathroom or something, whatever was necessary things to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: But in Warsaw, you didn't have an alternative plan or a hiding place or something?</span> <span id="s696">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: Did you know or were you aware of other Jewish people who were hiding out in the Polish side of Russia?</span></p> <p><span id="s698">A: No, and frankly I didn't want to know.</span> <span id="s699">I was afraid.</span> <span id="s700">I was afraid.</span> <span id="s701">You know everybody became for themselves.</span> <span id="s702">I was concerned about my mother and my sisters but I was afraid to get in touch if somebody even looked like Jewish.</span> <span id="s703">Not because I was hating the Jews, this was because of fear and -- of deep fear and suffering and not to be exposed to unpleasant things.</span> <span id="s704">In other words, if somebody was to identify me with a friend that is Jewish, they would automatically say why am I siding with the Jewish girl.</span> <span id="s705">So, if I am siding with a Jewish girl, I am Jewish also and my life was threatened.</span> <span id="s706">I was very much aware that I shouldn't get close to nobody.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: And you learned about the catholic religion largely on your own?</span> <span id="s708">02:38:</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: On my own, and just by looking the way others did.</span> <span id="s710">How the children behaved, how the children of the people that I worked behaved, and I followed them or maybe I should use the word emulated them with great intensity.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: Did you resent being Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: If I resented being Jewish, I don't know if I had the ability at that time to understand why I was born Jewish, but there were moments when I saw a cat or a dog and they were walking around freely, I envied them.</span> <span id="s713">I really envied them.</span> <span id="s714">I said why couldn't I be a cat.</span> <span id="s715">Why couldn't I be a dog.</span> <span id="s716">I should be able to move, but if I was angry with myself that I was born Jewish, I don't think that I understood at that time that this was part of history that I was born into.</span> <span id="s717">I don't think that I could think rationally like that like I look back now at this.</span> <span id="s718">That this was the period of history that it's unfortunate for me that I had to be born at this time.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q: But you would have felt safer if you were born catholic?</span></p> <p><span id="s720">A: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Q: So, you must have wished that you were truly catholic girl?</span></p> <p><span id="s722">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s723">You know, when I was running at night from one place to another, and I saw those lights in the homes and sometimes I heard laughter or talking in a normal way, family to family, I was so envious that those people lived normal and I run like a beaten up dog with constant fear with constant such heaviness in my head.</span> <span id="s724">How will I survive the next day or the next minute.</span> <span id="s725">I was walking one night through the fields to another family to convey something, and they stopped me.</span> <span id="s726">This was the police and they asked me immediately what is my name.</span> <span id="s727">I told them Bernislava Bershenska and somehow they let me go.</span> <span id="s728">I was at that time afraid that this would be it.</span> <span id="s729">You know assume that I caught myself in such moments, I assumed that I will die very soon.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q: When you got to Lublin and you could be open about who you were, what did that feel like?</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: I think we were very happy that our wish came true, that we finally survived Hitler.</span> <span id="s732">You cannot imagine the wish of young and old that they wished to survive only one day after Hitler is gone and I can die in peace.</span> <span id="s733">This was the children spoke like that, the adults spoke like that and this was a sense of freedom.</span> <span id="s734">A sense of freedom but also it brought our problems how to go on, what to do with this freedom.</span> <span id="s735">How our lives should continue.</span> <span id="s736">What will be next.</span> <span id="s737">How to reconstruct a life.</span> <span id="s738">The people were basically they were happy.</span> <span id="s739">They were concentrating with each other and we all became survivors as a matter of fact we became like a family.</span> <span id="s740">They were all practically -- most of them they</span></p> <p><span id="s741">02:42:30 were young because old people couldn't survive and children couldn't survive.</span> <span id="s742">So, the young people they tried to get acquainted with one another to do things for one another to care for another.</span> <span id="s743">As a matter of fact, a girl knew a boy three weeks, this already was a long time.</span> <span id="s744">Let's get married.</span> <span id="s745">Everybody was seeking somebody to be close to, to be together, to function as a human being again.</span> <span id="s746">A lot of people were looking for the families and they couldn't find.</span> <span id="s747">Like my husband arrived with his brother, he survived in Russia and he went to his hometown and he saw nothing.</span> <span id="s748">He was very disappointed.</span> <span id="s749">He had I think three or four brothers.</span> <span id="s750">Nobody was alive.</span> <span id="s751">Not a sign of any life in his hometown, so he came to Lublin at that time also.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: Was it easy to get close to people?</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: To our own survivors, yes, but not to others.</span> <span id="s754">As a matter of fact, to this day I don't know if you know about this but all our survivors they stick together.</span> <span id="s755">They do business together, they invited each other to all the Simchas or whatever was going on in our life as they would be asked in that family.</span> <span id="s756">This was</span></p> <p><span id="s757">02:44 such an enormous bond of the survivors that you couldn't even get with the very educated people here in the United States.</span> <span id="s758">I came as a foreigner with a very little education, what kind of contact would a young lady for instance like you with a higher education, with a normal life span, how would you understand my feelings.</span> <span id="s759">What I have been through.</span> <span id="s760">I tell you something that I must emphasize.</span> <span id="s761">When my child was here about in the United States six or seven years and I tried to learn about New York and the history through the children, so I was volunteering to go wherever they went like a planetarium museum something like that, and I dressed myself always very nicely.</span> <span id="s762">I was very presentable, but my English wasn't as good as they, so one day the teacher assigned me ten children to go to the planetarium I believe it was, and there was one child that he was abnormal in growth and I took care of that child and I had additional nine children.</span> <span id="s763">I was happy to go there.</span> <span id="s764">I remember there were like picnic tables</span></p> <p><span id="s765">02:46: on the outside, and the one teacher came over to me and she said would you like to share with me her group of children and my group of children the table.</span> <span id="s766">So, I said with pleasure.</span> <span id="s767">As soon as I opened my mouth, she left me.</span> <span id="s768">She left me by myself with the ten children at the table.</span> <span id="s769">There was plenty of room for her too, with her group.</span> <span id="s770">And I felt at that time that only because my English was so poor that she really probably didn't have pleasure to sit with me or talk to me about it.</span> <span id="s771">This pain I experienced and maybe I inflicted the pain by myself in my own mind.</span> <span id="s772">I am not sure, but this is at the time how I felt and I must tell you I will never forget this experience.</span> <span id="s773">It was very, very painful.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q: Did you eagerly embrace Judaism again or did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A: My husband came from a Jewish family where he spoke only Jewish.</span> <span id="s776">Instead of Polish or English I took over the Jewish language.</span> <span id="s777">We went on the high holidays we knew that we are Jewish.</span> <span id="s778">We knew that the children were going to have to be bar mitzvahed.</span> <span id="s779">We sent them to school that they should have knowledge about Judaism but we should go every Saturday to synagogue, we did not.</span> <span id="s780">And we were injured in a certain way.</span> <span id="s781">We said we could survive a war like that and we saw small children being killed or heard about it, there is no God.</span> <span id="s782">But deep down in our roots and our minds we knew that we are Jewish that we have to have a sense of belonging that eventually it started with the children that the children grow up that we should send them to a Jewish school and they should be bar mitzvahed and they should continue a Jewish life.</span> <span id="s783">But we didn't emphasize too much on it.</span> <span id="s784">I think when I look back now I should have done more.</span> <span id="s785">It wasn't so important to us at that time.</span> <span id="s786">And the excuse was -- the reasoning was at that time there is no God.</span> <span id="s787">Where is God when you saw killings like that.</span> <span id="s788">If I didn't see it myself I saw it on the pictures or the pain that I have been through.</span> <span id="s789">Why did I have to suffer so much.</span> <span id="s790">Where was God to protect me and the most pious people that they were sent away or were killed.</span> <span id="s791">So</span></p> <p><span id="s792">02:49: there was a big controversy in our mind why we should be so devoted to religion when there was no God to help us.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: Do you think that even after 50 years there is still a lingering impact from these experiences?</span> <span id="s794">Can you talk about that a little?</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: Yes, definitely.</span> <span id="s796">I lost my husband 23 years ago.</span> <span id="s797">I went to work.</span> <span id="s798">I succeeded in business, but I don't consider myself, I was pretty capable and very intelligent in certain areas, but those fears, those nightmares, the life that we went through as a younger woman and coming to the United States and trying so very hard to establish ourselves and now as we grow older sometimes I feel that maybe it wasn't worth it.</span> <span id="s799">Maybe it wasn't worth it.</span> <span id="s800">It's coming from the Warsaw Ghetto said our generation is dying out now.</span> <span id="s801">We are living now in the time that we are getting older and all of my friends are much older than I. I was a child at that time, so you can imagine now I am 66 and my friends are over 70 so everybody is in pain and aching and complaining and life as you go along brings certain disappointments so every period has it's own how shall I express myself, every age has its own good and bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Q: But how do you think that those years affected you in the long run?</span></p> <p><span id="s803">A: The years and the experience in my life and the fear it made me more capable.</span> <span id="s804">I am more self assured.</span> <span id="s805">I am more assertive person because of those experiences.</span> <span id="s806">This was the lesson that I lived that you cannot be afraid to go on living.</span> <span id="s807">This is how I feel, but sometimes there are moments when you are thinking if it was worth it.</span> <span id="s808">Of course I brought two children into the world, but I am also disappointed in my life.</span> <span id="s809">I lost my husband 22 years ago and he left me with certain obligations and I did it quite well.</span> <span id="s810">I continued to go on living.</span> <span id="s811">I get it done and I have very nice children, but it's not easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q: There must have been some psychological impact of all of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A: Yes, definitely.</span> <span id="s814">We are all very frightened people.</span> <span id="s815">In a way we are brave.</span> <span id="s816">There is one side that we are very brave.</span> <span id="s817">We think we can conquer everything and there's a certain amount of fear that we have in daily lives, which remains I think from childhood.</span> <span id="s818">Now that the population is aging you fear being alone, you fear getting ill.</span> <span id="s819">The structure of the family life in the United States as you well know it's not the same as maybe in other cultures.</span> <span id="s820">The children go their separate ways.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">Q: Are these fears different than anyone else's?</span> <span id="s822">Those fears are similar to other people who didn't have your experience, don't you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s823">02:54:</span></p> <p><span id="s824">A: You see those people that they didn't have the experience, this frightening days and lost youth and not being educated, and trying so very hard, maybe they accept the life differently than I.</span> <span id="s825">You understand?</span> <span id="s826">I went so much through, I survived so much, I remained a widow and I started to go on living and to go on in life and as you're starting to age, sometime I express myself that it was a false gain.</span> <span id="s827">That the whole life is a false game.</span> <span id="s828">I don't know if this is a healthy expression or a healthy outlook or not, but this is how I feel.</span> <span id="s829">Because of this fear enormous fear that we live through and coming to a country without education, without language without any profession and to try so hard and you run and you run and you try everything and then you say for what?</span> <span id="s830">I don't know if this is the approaching age that speaks of me or maybe the fear of what I have suffered so much didn't pay off enough for me you know because I didn't have a wholesome life since my husband passed away.</span> <span id="s831">This is probably a combination of my feelings.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">Q: Is there anything else you want to add that you think is important?</span></p> <p><span id="s833">A: I think it's very important -- you know I went to Miami this February, I attended the meeting of 3,000 people and I was so very proud of myself that I was among them.</span> <span id="s834">That the world and the history shouldn't forget not only us as survivors but also those six million innocent people that were killed.</span> <span id="s835">It's very painful to read in the paper and this day and to hear that somebody can write a book and to deny our history what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">There is no humility in the human kind of something of this or people just want to get away from such times that we lived through which was so painful and people want to wash themselves clean and go away.</span> <span id="s837">I don't know if it's Germany or maybe any other nations they don't want to know about the Jews what happened and they want to forget.</span> <span id="s838">And this is really painful to hear that.</span> <span id="s839">That we are living in such -- we achieve so much technique in our lives but the basic human animalistic things I think remains even now, the way it was 50 years ago.</span> <span id="s840">This is my opinion.</span> <span id="s841">I don't know if I express myself right.</span> <span id="s842">Do you understand what I mean?</span> <span id="s843">This is very painful.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Q: Anything else you want to say?</span></p> <p><span id="s845">A: I'm glad that you came to interview me, that maybe through this tape and my expression somebody will benefit by it and gain by it, but I don't with no one in the world to experience such fear and such pain as I have been through.</span> <span id="s846">This is all I have to say.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">(Viewing pictures) This is 1943 where I was working for that lady where she had a little store selling liquor and alcohol and I worked there with her.</span> <span
