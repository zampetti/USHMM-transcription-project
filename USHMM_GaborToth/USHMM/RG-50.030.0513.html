always sent tickets for her to come.</span> <span id="s201">She was three times in New York visiting us for months, and we took -- and she was very excited, we took her to Niagara Falls, and [Ms. Zelazny quotes her mother, speaking in Yiddish.]</span> <span id="s202">, she say, “Is this true?</span> <span id="s203">I’m here, I’m here?”</span> <span id="s204">I say, “Yes Mom, here is the [indecipherable], this is New York, the big buildings.”</span> <span id="s205">[Ms. Zelazny quotes her mother, speaking in Yiddish.]</span> <span id="s206">She never saw them -- this is so beautiful.</span> <span id="s207">I am so happy to be -- and I tooked her to museums.</span> <span id="s208">She -- she was very -- she didn’t study, they didn’t have the right, Jews, to study a lot.</span> <span id="s209">Two, three grades.</span> <span id="s210">She knew to read and write Yiddish and Polish.</span> <span id="s211">My grandfather, her father, Todres Weinstein came from Kiev.</span> <span id="s212">He was a young man, came to -- you know, to peddle, he was a peddler.</span> <span id="s213">He was selling shoelaces, [indecipherable] material for -- for sewing.</span> <span id="s214">And he knew Russian, Yiddish, and then he learned Polish, and he was a very, very interesting man, and he taught my mom.</span> <span id="s215">My mom was talented, there were many sisters and brothers on my mother’s side, there was seven.</span> <span id="s216">My grandfather met this young woman with a child on the ca -- market.</span> <span id="s217">And he was selling ribbons and all kind of things, accessories.</span> <span id="s218">And she came, and he looked at her and he said, buy this, buy that.</span> <span id="s219">So she say, “I don’t have enough money, I’ll come another day.”</span> <span id="s220">He said, no, “I’ll give you this and then when you come another time, you pay me.”</span> <span id="s221">And he ask a question, “Where’s your husband?”</span> <span id="s222">Think she say, I’m a widow with a child.</span> <span id="s223">Her son’s name was Natan, Nute in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s224">And they fell in love.</span> <span id="s225">He was a bachelor and he married her, and he raised his chi -- my -- my Uncle Nute was a big man, tall.</span> <span id="s226">And the Polish people were very prejudiced against Jews, and if something happened, they say oh, dirty Jew, in Polish, or they beat up, or they bothered the girls, the Jewish girls.</span> <span id="s227">So my Uncle Nute beat them all up.</span> <span id="s228">And when he was coming, they yelled, Natan is coming, Natan is coming, so they knew to run away.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: He was like a fighter, he protected every girl, everybody.</span> <span id="s231">Was tall, I remember him.</span> <span id="s232">And then they have seven more children, my buba alte.</span> <span id="s233">They call her alte, in Yiddish alte is too old.</span> <span id="s234">Why they gave the name, I ask.</span> <span id="s235">Alte means old, and she should grow old --</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: To live and grow old.</span> <span id="s238">I don’t know the names why they gave, but this was this.</span> <span id="s239">And they lived in a different suburb in Praga.</span> <span id="s240">Poland had -- Warsaw had a few suburbs.</span> <span id="s241">We lived in the Warsaw area and they lived in Praga, be -- a little bit farther by tramway or bu -- to go.</span> <span id="s242">So they visited once in awhile, and I remember Zaide Todres, he was the only zaide I had, grandparent -- grandfather, because the other one died young, my father’s side.</span> <span id="s243">So I had two bubas, granddau -- ba -- mothers, they were wonderful, the family was wonderful and we were all living together, and happy.</span> <span id="s244">And Chanukah or other holidays, Jewish holidays, they gave us a lot of gifts and sweets, and we were happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: Were you -- bef -- by the time you were five years old, were you very conscious of yourself as a Jewish child?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: You were not.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: So there’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: There was no difference, we never discuss that we are different, or whatever.</span> <span id="s251">They spoke Polish, we spoke Jewish, but I was home.</span> <span id="s252">I never went to a kindergarten there.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: Because they decided we don’t have money, they poor people, they raise the children in the house, and there was a buba to -- to look after us, and there was an uncle [indecipherable] who lived together in the same area, so I never went then.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: And it was there that people became much more conscious of the religious differences?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: Yeah, when I became conscious, when Germany invaded Poland, and they bombed Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: Do you remember that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: What -- what -- what do you remember as a -- if you can describe it as [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: I -- I -- I remember many things.</span> <span id="s261">First of all I remember fire, burning houses, burning trees.</span> <span id="s262">Glass, broken glass, and people running and yelling and shooting.</span> <span id="s263">German, with the big German shepherd, the dogs --</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: -- with their uniform.</span> <span id="s266">Big, tall men with the German uniform with the hats, and the -- the boots, they had the high --</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: Boots.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: -- leather boots, and holding the dog next to.</span> <span id="s269">And we -- when Warsaw was bombed, we didn’t have electricity, didn’t have water in the apartment.</span> <span id="s270">So we were going -- first of all, my father was very active in a Jewish Bund.</span> <span id="s271">they call it, the organization, that he was always being arrested before the first of May or whatever, because they made riots.</span> <span id="s272">It was very political organization, used to wear a Jewish uniform.</span> <span id="s273">And he knew what’s going to happen, and said to the family, “We have to leave Warsaw, we have to go away, they’re going to kill all Jews, because Germans kill -- Germans do all that atrocity, I see and we know it.”</span> <span id="s274">But nobody was expecting anything.</span> <span id="s275">My grandmother Chana and the other brother says to my father, du meshugener, Moishe.</span> <span id="s276">“You crazy.</span> <span id="s277">Why you going away, why you want to run away?”</span> <span id="s278">He says, “I have to.”</span> <span id="s279">So my grandmother says, “But we have the war before,” 1914, the far -- first war, World War, “nothing happened, they da -- we were hungry, we didn’t have food, but nothing happened to us, nobody killed us.</span> <span id="s280">Just people who were on the front, in the line, they were killed sometime, but nothing will happen to us, why to run away?”</span> <span id="s281">He said, “I am going away.</span> <span id="s282">I take my wife and the children.</span> <span id="s283">Who wants to come with me?</span> <span id="s284">I’m going to hire a buggy with a horse, and we’ll run away from Warsaw.”</span> <span id="s285">Nobody listened.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: Did you hear these conversations, Sarah?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: Did you hear these conversa --</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: Yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: You did.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: -- they talking --</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: They talking in front of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: They were talking in front of me, and I was asking later questions when I understood more, why, and this and my father came -- well, first I want to tell you how I got encountered with the German, with the atrocity.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: Since there was no water in the house, we had to go with pails and get water on the cemetery, not far, they call it Powanski, the cemetery in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s296">So we have to get water, there was a pump, and water running.</span> <span id="s297">So people stood on line and got water in pails.</span> <span id="s298">So I had a little pail also I was carrying and my mother had two.</span> <span id="s299">We brought water, whatever we could we gave to the buba, to everybody.</span> <span id="s300">They also went to get water.</span> <span id="s301">So what I seen, young German soldiers with the dogs, with the shepherds, with the big stick wi -- you know, like a big pole and a rubber, very heavy rubber.</span> <span id="s302">They put a Jewish man that was walking, with a beard, you can see it’s a Chassidic Jew.</span> <span id="s303">They grabbed him, and the Germans said [speaks foreign language here] you dirty Jew.</span> <span id="s304">And took a knife out from his boot, and cut it with -- not just the beard, with the -- it was running blood, he touch his flesh, and pushed him aside, he fell.</span> <span id="s305">So many things that they stepped with the dogs, you know, like very vicious.</span> <span id="s306">And my father saw that, and I was crying and my mom said, Surele -- I was holding her dress because she -- her hands were busy with the two pi -- pails of water, I was holding her dress, and she said to me in Yiddish Surele [speaks Yiddish here], close your eyes, my child.</span> <span id="s307">Surele she called me all the time, and I loved that name.</span> <span id="s308">And she said, Surele [Yiddish], don’t look.</span> <span id="s309">Please let’s go fast home.</span> <span id="s310">And I saw that horses lying, electric poles, because they bombed Warsaw.</span> <span id="s311">So whatever there was bombing, houses destroyed, sa -- the streets, there was a chaos.</span> <span id="s312">People didn’t know where to go, what to do.</span> <span id="s313">So one evening my father decided to bring a carriage with a horse, and he said to my mom [speaks Yiddish], take whatever you can, but not [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s314">They sew in, because they had nice jewelry, nice clothe -- my father was dressed very elegant, in suit.</span> <span id="s315">I used to shine his shoes, it has to be like a mirror.</span> <span id="s316">In Poland still as a big girl I did that.</span> <span id="s317">He taught me.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: He taught you to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: He was so pedantic, so meticulous.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: But you were not a wealthy family.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: But -- but there were some things that --</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: Some things that -- yeah.</span> <span id="s324">My mother had a few rings, a wedding band, and a few rings, my father too.</span> <span id="s325">They sew it into the clothing, you know?</span> <span id="s326">They had dresses, a coat in winter.</span> <span id="s327">It was September, November already, it was cold and raining, so we gathered all the warm clothes.</span> <span id="s328">My mom had a few small suitcases with food for us.</span> <span id="s329">So my fa -- my si -- brother was dressed very nice, he had a -- a gray coat, a small, with a little heart, you know, you g -- pull it, close it here.</span> <span id="s330">He was so cute.</span> <span id="s331">And shoes, and they put us -- everybody cried, and nobody wanted to come with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: Were you frightened?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s334">I cried, too, and my mom held my eyes so that I should not see.</span> <span id="s335">It was nighttime and they were running and the city of Warsaw was burning.</span> <span id="s336">And people running and noises all over.</span> <span id="s337">I never forget that.</span> <span id="s338">And I ask a question once, my mom and dad -- we spoke mostly Yiddish at home --</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: Yes [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: -- but we knew Polish, too.</span> <span id="s341">I say [speaks foreign language here], “Why is this happening?</span> <span id="s342">Why?”</span> <span id="s343">So my father say, “Because we are Jews.</span> <span id="s344">Because Germans hate us, they want to destroy us.”</span> <span id="s345">I said, “But why?</span> <span id="s346">What did we do different.</span> <span id="s347">We are living here, you were born here, your father was born in -- everybody was living, they have roots.</span> <span id="s348">Why?”</span> <span id="s349">He said, “I cannot explain why, that’s what happens.”</span> <span id="s350">And we run, we run out of Warsaw, burning Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: Sarah, we have to stop the -- we have to stop the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: If you can remember where you are --</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: -- as you’re running away.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: Yeah, we run away.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">End of Tape One</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Beginning Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: Okay, Surele.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: Did you know that your father was a Bundist member?</span> <span id="s362">Did you understand what they meant really?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: I didn't understand then.</span> <span id="s364">I knew that he had a uniform and thing, and he used to disappear for days, you know, they used to arrest him, and th-the whole bunch.</span> <span id="s365">And I didn’t know that.</span> <span id="s366">Mom used to say, oh, your father went away, he’ll come home soon, he has some business, this and that.</span> <span id="s367">But at those days I -- I didn’t comprehend --</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: You didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: -- what it is, what Bund is, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: But he was a long, long, time member, and they were fighting against the Nazis --</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: -- and everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: So some Bund members stayed in Warsaw and others left, I’m sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: I don’t know if some left, I know that -- I know a few who just died.</span> <span id="s376">Meed was his name, Benjamin Meed.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: He was also in the same organizati-zation --</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: As your father.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: -- as my father, yeah, and he has this ghetto si -- Warsaw ghetto survivor organization --</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: -- that he was running it.</span> <span id="s383">I used to attend.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: You describe after the Nazis attacked that there was no running water.</span> <span id="s385">But you also said that prior to the Nazis there was no wa -- running water in your home, or is that not true?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: No.</span> <span id="s388">There was?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: There was, in the corridor -- li-lived in apartments and there was like a hallway.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: And in the hallway there was pump with water.</span> <span id="s392">So it was not running water in your kitchen or [indecipherable] we have to carry the water in pails, bring it to the apartment to kitchen, and use it.</span> <span id="s393">Or washing whatever you have to wash -- we didn’t have showers.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: Not even a bathroom in the room, we had to go outdoors.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: You have to go outdoors for the bathroom.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s398">And a -- a funny story.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: The bathroom thing that they used, my grandmother Chana used to take a pail of all the dirty stuff, that we peed, or other things and throw it out at night somewhere on a corner that doesn’t touch nobody or will not smell some in the middle of the street.</span> <span id="s401">So I -- she was very superstition.</span> <span id="s402">So, she took me with her sometime and sometime my mom.</span> <span id="s403">I didn’t understand then, but I will tell you what she did.</span> <span id="s404">They were so superstitious then that they believed that dead bodies, dead people walk at night around us, but we don’t see them.</span> <span id="s405">So she used to say, before she spilled that dirt, she used to say, “Scheidem, scheidem,” -- scheidem is like dead bodies, “Scheidem, gay avek, gay avek.”</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: Go away.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: Go away.</span> <span id="s408">We have things to do, go away, don’t stay in front of us.</span> <span id="s409">On all four sides.</span> <span id="s410">East, west, south, no-north, wherever.</span> <span id="s411">Four sides she turned, and she say the same thing --</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: -- scheidem, scheidem [indecipherable], please excuse me, go away.</span> <span id="s414">And then, after she went to all the four sides, she did the business, she threw it away.</span> <span id="s415">And I was standing, and I was really afraid.</span> <span id="s416">I didn’t know exactly what scheidem is, but she explained like dead bodies and this.</span> <span id="s417">I didn’t associate with d-dead bodies then, I didn’t see too many.</span> <span id="s418">So I couldn’t understand, but when I got older, I know the superstitious, you know, people had in the old days, everybody is superstitious.</span> <span id="s419">So I understood the way they treated the dead bodies with respect, that they might be hurt by her.</span> <span id="s420">This is a very funny thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: There are many things.</span> <span id="s423">I used to -- my Aunt Reisl, which is like a -- a rose, yeah?</span> <span id="s424">She was the only sister of six brothers.</span> <span id="s425">She was beautiful, she was a seamstress with her husband also, Herman.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: This is the sister of your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: Of my father.</span> <span id="s428">They had four children.</span> <span id="s429">Two of the names I remember.</span> <span id="s430">One, the name -- the first born by everybody in the family Szlinger was Mordechai, Mijatek.</span> <span id="s431">Okay, in Polish, Mijatek.</span> <span id="s432">Like a translation from Yiddish Mordechai.</span> <span id="s433">And the baby girl was Bronia, Bronka they call.</span> <span id="s434">And the two others, younger, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s435">They were all redheads.</span> <span id="s436">We were a family of redheads and I had a lot of freckles.</span> <span id="s437">I still have -- that hair, it’s colored, I’m not red originally, I have gray, and then my hair become very dark, after they were cutting my hair in Russia a lot, so it becames black, really changed the color.</span> <span id="s438">But it was a very happy family.</span> <span id="s439">They were not rich, but happy together and singing and dancing, all the movies they saw they were singing the songs.</span> <span id="s440">That’s what I talked about Molitik -- and how do I know Molly Pickens?</span> <span id="s441">From them.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: And then I saw her movies.</span> <span id="s444">I saw her in Yentl in “Fiddler on the Roof.”</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: You did, yes, in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: When -- when you -- you and your brother and your mother and father get on this horse and buggy, yes?</span> <span id="s450">And there’s no other family members, those --</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: They didn’t want to.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: They wou -- they wouldn’t go.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: No.</span> <span id="s454">My father came at night, and he prepared us before, told my mom to do some gathering things, clothing, food for the children, everything.</span> <span id="s455">It was fall, November was already cold and raining.</span> <span id="s456">And he asks the brothers and the sisters, also he can get some horses and buggies, renting for money, and run away.</span> <span id="s457">So my grandmother Chanaleh -- Chana and others say that my bro -- my father’s a meshugener, a crazy.</span> <span id="s458">Where you taking young children in such a cold bitterness, you running away, why?</span> <span id="s459">He says, “It’s going to be worse.</span> <span id="s460">Germany is going to kill every Jew, and they going to make camps.”</span> <span id="s461">So my buba Chana say, “You crazy.</span> <span id="s462">Before, in the 14’s, there was a war, nothing happened, we were only hungry.</span> <span id="s463">But nothing happened to Jews.”</span> <span id="s464">So he said, “Who wants to come with us?”</span> <span id="s465">He has a premonition or he knew something from the organization what’s going on -- to happen.</span> <span id="s466">And seeing dead body in the streets, and dead horses, and German running with German Shepherds, and beating every old man or young man, or taking Jewish beards and cut them with blood running.</span> <span id="s467">He saw that it’s not good, so he brought that at night, the horse, and my mom was ready.</span> <span id="s468">We did not understand anything then, I didn’t know what’s going on.</span> <span id="s469">I cried, my brother cried, we were -- you know, hushed up by my mom, my father, and we left.</span> <span id="s470">We left Warsaw burning, Warsaw was burning.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: Do you re --</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: I remember the fire.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: You do?</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: Like, do you see, “Gone With the Wind”, the burning of Atlanta?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: Mm-hm, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: That’s how --</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: That’s how it looked?</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: -- I remember that, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: And the smell.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: And the smell and everything and the danger.</span> <span id="s481">And the smell of dead bodies, and Germans standing all this, and Polacks standing, you know, they think that never happen to them, and they were happy, smiling, they showing like this.</span> <span id="s482">Like they going to be slaughtered like this, you know?</span> <span id="s483">They were happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: Did you see --</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: -- Polish gentiles doing that --</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: Yeah, yes.</span> <span id="s488">Yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: -- around the neck?</span> <span id="s490">Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s492">So, at night we didn’t know where we running.</span> <span id="s493">We’re running and running a few days.</span> <span id="s494">We went -- my father told my mom in Jewish that we’re going to a border between Poland and Russia.</span> <span id="s495">There’s many borders.</span> <span id="s496">We went to a place called Zaremby-Koscielne.</span> <span id="s497">It’s a Polish -- it’s a -- Koscielne means churches, a place of churches.</span> <span id="s498">There were probably a lot of churches in that, that’s why it’s called Zaremby-Koscielne in Polish.</span> <span id="s499">Kosciel is me -- is Polish, a church.</span> <span id="s500">So we went to Zaremby-Koscielne.</span> <span id="s501">It was raining, cold.</span> <span id="s502">We had some clothes, some this, but it was wet, we were soaked wet.</span> <span id="s503">They -- the horse and buggy -- the buggy wa -- the carriage was open, we didn’t have any cover, only a -- the blankets which were soaked already, and we came to that place.</span> <span id="s504">It was woods and a big field, raining, dark and -- and gray, very bitter cold, and we stopped there.</span> <span id="s505">The German -- that was a border between Russia and Polish.</span> <span id="s506">I don’t know exactly the geography, but it’s -- was somewhere in the south, it’s -- was -- bete -- we were supposed to go to Bialystok.</span> <span id="s507">It was Russian border then, now Bialystok is back Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: Bialystok means a white mountain, Bialystok.</span> <span id="s510">And we stood in Zaremby-Koscielne, Germans were around us with dogs, of course, and from the trees, the pine trees, my father made like a chalash, like the Indian live in this.</span> <span id="s511">But the rain penetrated anywhere, so we were wet there, the bedding that they brought, everything was soaked, we were cold, my feet were frozen, and my brother cried, my brother cried, he was always hungry.</span> <span id="s512">He was a baby, he didn’t understand.</span> <span id="s513">One day they took everybody out on the field, like gathering together.</span> <span id="s514">My father was holding my brother on his ha -- in his hand.</span> <span id="s515">I was holding my mother’s hand, nothing else, and the Germans came like making an ins-inspection.</span> <span id="s516">Who this and this and my brother cried, Mordechai cried, so my father held him like this and said, shh.</span> <span id="s517">So the German came over with this stick, the rubber stick, slashed my father’s face with it, and with such a rage.</span> <span id="s518">I don’t know why, there was no reason.</span> <span id="s519">He just beat him with that and cr -- and here was open and blood was running his -- over the -- his face, so my -- we all cried.</span> <span id="s520">I cried, my mom cried and my brother cried very much.</span> <span id="s521">So the German, zai schtul, mas schtul, be quite.</span> <span id="s522">And we stopped.</span> <span id="s523">So the German came, one German had a piece of salami like the [indecipherable] thing, he gave it to my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: Gave him a piece, or gave him the whole thing?</span> <span id="s525">A -- a little piece.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: Like -- like this length, yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: -- a narrow piece of good wurst, salami.</span> <span id="s529">And my father took and shared with all four of us, we ate.</span> <span id="s530">And he says to him, you have very nice children, but don’t stay here.</span> <span id="s531">That means he was human.</span> <span id="s532">He had to do his job, the German, but he told us, my father especially not to be here, because Germany is taking young men to the country and they started already, they prepared for concentration camps.</span> <span id="s533">We didn’t know that then, but now, after this, you know the history, they prepared that in Poland, the railroads and the barracks, they were built before the concentration -- years before, they prepared.</span> <span id="s534">And I don’t understand one thing.</span> <span id="s535">Did they not realize what is it for?</span> <span id="s536">Nobody spoke about it, nobody knew about it?</span> <span id="s537">That’s a puzzle to me, because it was done before, years before.</span> <span id="s538">All the barracks, all the railroads to go from all -- it was a big, big project to do, from all over Europe to bring trains to this place.</span> <span id="s539">To Treblinka, to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: You think they made new tracks?</span> <span id="s541">Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: They prepared long time before they started to do it.</span> <span id="s543">And I think the Polish government knew too, but it was not a Communist government there, it was other.</span> <span id="s544">So, when --</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: So he warned your father to go away.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: -- when -- when the German gave us salami and everything, where everybody was happy, they say go to your places, my father said to my mom -- I knew later, I didn’t know as a child what happened, that you stay with the children, try to break the border.</span> <span id="s547">Go to Russia, and I am running to Bialystok and I will wait for you in the synagogue.</span> <span id="s548">There was a big Jewish synagogue in Bialystok.</span> <span id="s549">And over there we will meet.</span> <span id="s550">I don’t know when we will come.</span> <span id="s551">My father disappeared the next day.</span> <span id="s552">We didn’t know anything, we cried.</span> <span id="s553">My mom said, shh to me.</span> <span id="s554">My brother didn’t understand, he was little.</span> <span id="s555">But she told me, “Surele, don’t cry.</span> <span id="s556">Your father will come.</span> <span id="s557">We will meet with Father.</span> <span id="s558">Just be good girl.”</span> <span id="s559">We didn’t have food, but the German didn’t bother then so much, so my mom went -- she left us alone with some other older people to watch, and she went to work.</span> <span id="s560">There were a lot of Jewish Polish families living there in Zaremby-Koscielne, and she went to look for work, whatever.</span> <span id="s561">She could cook, she could clean, she could do anything, watch children, and she found a little job by very rich family that they came from Russia pal -- they -- they send them to this place like, you know, a punishment, something, the Communists or whatever.</span> <span id="s562">And she cleaned there, she cooked and she brought some food for us, whatever leftover, potatoes, a little bit chicken, whatever, bread.</span> <span id="s563">We were happy to have that.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: Where are you staying?</span> <span id="s565">Are you outside?</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: On the field.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: On the field, are there other --</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: On the field as a -- for long.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: -- refugees there?</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: Refugee -- like a refugee place.</span> <span id="s571">It was not wired, nothing.</span> <span id="s572">It was [indecipherable] from all the sides surrounded.</span> <span id="s573">It was like a field, open field between woods.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: And you’re outside, you have no shelter?</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: No, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: Nothing, that -- the pine trees my father cut that they put together like in a V --</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: In the V.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: That was all.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: That was all.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: Everything.</span> <span id="s582">When was nice weather my mother took out the -- the goosefeathers, you know, the blanket from goosefeather, very heavy.</span> <span id="s583">They call it a perine in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s584">It’s like a goosefeather blanket, very heavy.</span> <span id="s585">I still have one.</span> <span id="s586">It’s good for the winter, it’s light.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: And what did she do, put it outside so it would dry?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: To dry, yeah, and then to cover us at night that we don’t feel cold.</span> <span id="s589">My feet were swollen from cold, I couldn’t walk.</span> <span id="s590">My toes, still today when it’s bad weather --</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: You feel it.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: -- I have my big toes swollen bigger, and they itch.</span> <span id="s593">Before, I had blisters, it was swollen from the cold and I had blisters, I couldn’t even walk.</span> <span id="s594">But there was no medication to -- to heal it, just time did it, but I still feel when it’s very cold I feel they bother me like needles coming through, and -- and psychological -- psychologically I will always remember this thing what happened, because it was a tremendous impact on my life as a child, to go through this and not understanding why.</span> <span id="s595">Now I know why.</span> <span id="s596">I know the politics, I know what happened, now I know why.</span> <span id="s597">But then, what the German did to children and later on with the camps, that was terrible what they did.</span> <span id="s598">That was the worst part.</span> <span id="s599">These were intelligent, educated people.</span> <span id="s600">Germany was a very advanced -- with everything, technologically, and a -- and how could a nation do that to every people in the world, and not just Jews, to Russian, [indecipherable] and Gypsies.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: How do you --</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: Exterminating millions and millions and the whole world stood still.</span> <span id="s603">Why?</span> <span id="s604">Nobody cared.</span> <span id="s605">Nobody said anything.</span> <span id="s606">So when we tried to smuggle the border, my mother tried every evening to -- there were the booths, and there was a Polish soldier on this side, Russian soldier -- you know, they like -- on the border they had a booth, yes, one Polish flag and one side the Russian flag, and soldiers in their uniforms.</span> <span id="s607">The Russians stood with the rifles, and the Polish with the rifles.</span> <span id="s608">So my mother took us every day, sometime in the evening, sometime in the afternoon, but not at dark, and she spoke Russian and she spoke Polish to the other.</span> <span id="s609">I remember the Russian soldier got upset, he took the rifle and say in Russian, “Davai na zad.”</span> <span id="s610">Go back.</span> <span id="s611">My mother didn’t want to move back, and she started to beg and cry.</span> <span id="s612">He pushed her with the carabine -- with the rifle, with the other side, with the wooden side, pushed her in here and my mother fell, and she didn't move.</span> <span id="s613">And we thought my -- the mother is dead.</span> <span id="s614">Me and my brother started to cry.</span> <span id="s615">Momma, Momma, we spoke Polish.</span> <span id="s616">Momma stine, Momma styoff in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s617">Get up, get up Momma.</span> <span id="s618">You not dead, you not dead.</span> <span id="s619">And the -- my mother was like fainted or whatever, she didn’t move.</span> <span id="s620">So the soldier came over, the Russian, yelling at us, davai na zad, but we didn’t know what davai na zad is.</span> <span id="s621">Go back, go back.</span> <span id="s622">But s -- I cry, I say Momma, Momma.</span> <span id="s623">And they spoke Polish on the border, the Russian spoke Polish.</span> <span id="s624">I said to him in Polish, “My mom is dead?</span> <span id="s625">My mom is not living?”</span> <span id="s626">So he say, “Your mom is going to be fine.”</span> <span id="s627">He went down, I don’t know what he said to her.</span> <span id="s628">She later told me.</span> <span id="s629">When she came to herself, sh -- he picked her up, he -- her -- she was all in mud, it was muddy, rainy, and we went back to our place.</span> <span id="s630">And she tried again.</span> <span id="s631">With the Polish soldier nothing, they -- they were very rude, they couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s632">One day -- she kept separ -- now I understand she kept secrets from me or brother -- my brother was little.</span> <span id="s633">She couldn’t tell me.</span> <span id="s634">And she said one day to me, “Surele, gather everything what we have the little bundles, put everything together and we go for a walk in the evening.”</span> <span id="s635">It was a nice evening, it was not raining and it wasn’t cold, it was dry.</span> <span id="s636">And we walked.</span> <span id="s637">I was holding my mom by the skirt because she was holding my brother, he couldn’t walk too much.</span> <span id="s638">And Mordechai, my brother, the chubby guy, always was hungry, always.</span> <span id="s639">He liked food and was hungry.</span> <span id="s640">He was crying because he was hungry.</span> <span id="s641">And whenever I had a piece of bread she gave us the same ration, I cut a piece for him later.</span> <span id="s642">I knew he will cry, so I gave him my share.</span> <span id="s643">One evening we went to the woods, didn’t tell us anything.</span> <span id="s644">She say we going here, maybe we’ll find something to eat, some grass growing or mushrooms, you know, wild mushrooms, wild grass, and we’ll find.</span> <span id="s645">And it was dark, it was twilight, you know, it wasn’t light any more.</span> <span id="s646">But we could still see, and we were walking along the line and there was a wire, you know, there were -- it was wired, the whole thing.</span> <span id="s647">And all of a sudden my mom says, “Sit here, let’s sit here.”</span> <span id="s648">We sat on the grass, my mother went to the wire to the gate, and underneath she pushed it up, there was like a hole.</span> <span id="s649">Later I find out that the soldier, when he beat her and she was laying like that, he told her, at night you go here, and there is a open wire.</span> <span id="s650">And you go to the woods.</span> <span id="s651">And he told her what to expect.</span> <span id="s652">She didn’t say anything to us, nothing, we were too little, and we could tell.</span> <span id="s653">So what happened?</span> <span id="s654">She digged a little bit, she pushed my brother underneath, fine, she pushed me, and then she made a little higher, I was holding up the wire a little bit, lifted it as much as I could for five years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: So we went through, and we had a little thing, my mother was holding my brother, I was her skirt, because she needed two hands, always with her skirt, she was wearing a long skirt, warm.</span> <span id="s657">And we’re walking, and it’s dark and I used to hear stories about wolves and -- and wild animals, that they going to eat us up, and my mom said, “Don’t worry, nobody is going to eat us, there’s nobody, it’s too cold.”</span> <span id="s658">All of a sudden -- we walk, we walk maybe an hour or more, I see some light.</span> <span id="s659">I had very good vision, I see some light far away like a little light.</span> <span id="s660">I said, Mama, Mama [speaks Yiddish] in Yiddish, I said to her, “Look, there’s some light.”</span> <span id="s661">She says, “Shh, don’t say.”</span> <span id="s662">She knew where we going.</span> <span id="s663">We came closer, there’s a little wooden shack, like, and lights.</span> <span id="s664">We came in, we knocked into the door, a older woman opened the door.</span> <span id="s665">And there was a man -- I feel chills when I tell that, because I remember that story well.</span> <span id="s666">And the woman said to her, to my mother, in Polish, “Who are you?”</span> <span id="s667">Kto ty jest?</span> <span id="s668">So my mom says, “I’m running from Warsaw, the Germans killed my f -- husband, he is not alive.</span> <span id="s669">I have two sick children, please help me.”</span> <span id="s670">So she say, “Come in.”</span> <span id="s671">Inside there was that woman, an older man, probably her husband and a young woman, maybe the daughter.</span> <span id="s672">They gave us food, they washed us, and they put us on the h-hay, there was hay on the floor.</span> <span id="s673">And she give us covers to cover ourself for night, and she says, in Polish she said to my mom, “Don’t say anything who let you through.</span> <span id="s674">This is the border between this -- we live here many years, we speak Polish and Russian.</span> <span id="s675">This is our home, but this is the border between Poland and Russia.”</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: We need -- we need to change the tape, so we’ll continue this story on the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">End of Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Beginning Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s681">Sarah, you were in this little house?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: Hut, hut.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q: Hut, it was really a hut.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: It’s a wooden hut.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: And -- and they put you on hay, and gave you some blankets.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s687">That was th --</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: And is your mother laying there as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: The three of you were laying there?</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: The three.</span> <span id="s692">We were not -- never separated.</span> <span id="s693">I clinged to my mother, my mother took care of the brother, the little baby boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: Boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: And because he always cried, he was not like I. I don’t understand myself how I was patient at this age of five, five and something, that I never cried and I never ask for anything, I always held my mother’s skirt.</span> <span id="s696">Be -- I -- I was afraid to be separated because people used to run and losing one another and yelling and not finding one another.</span> <span id="s697">That was terrible show.</span> <span id="s698">But I remember.</span> <span id="s699">So we slept, they gave us food in that little shack.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q: So they were nice to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s702">And they gave us dry clothes, you know, like a big rubashka, she will ask what it is, like a nightgown --</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: -- but made of cotton, rough cotton, you know, with long sleeve and long -- it was too long for me, for my age, but I kept warm.</span> <span id="s705">I was so warm, it was so good and dry, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: And she dried our clothes, and the next day she said to my mom -- my mother’s name was Perele in Yiddish, but the Russian call her Perla.</span> <span id="s708">Perla like a -- a -- a d -- no, Pearl.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: A pearl.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: So she said to my mom, “Perla, you can not stay here.</span> <span id="s713">This is a border gathering.</span> <span id="s714">The Russian sold -- soldiers come here to warm up, to drink something, to eat, and they leave.</span> <span id="s715">In the morning you will have to leave.”</span> <span id="s716">So my mom cried, she said, “Where would I go with the little sick children?</span> <span id="s717">My child’s legs are frozen, Sarah’s legs.”</span> <span id="s718">So she say -- she gave me some bandages to cover the wounds and she gave us food and my mom took out her wedding band and gave it to them because we didn’t have money to pay.</span> <span id="s719">She didn’t want to tell -- take it, as -- and Momma says, “Take it.</span> <span id="s720">Maybe one days you will help somebody also.</span> <span id="s721">You need that.”</span> <span id="s722">In the morning we were sleeping very comfortable then all of a sudden we woke up to light.</span> <span id="s723">There was like a flashlight coming down [indecipherable] on the floor, flashlight came to our face.</span> <span id="s724">I opened my eyes and got scared.</span> <span id="s725">And my mom say vynish, vynish, don’t cry.</span> <span id="s726">And the Russian ask my mom, “You a Russian?”</span> <span id="s727">Because her father came from Kiev, he taught her Russian, Yiddish, write and speak.</span> <span id="s728">My grandfather Todres from Kiev, he was an educated man.</span> <span id="s729">And she spoke to them in Russian, they spoke Russian and he ask her [indecipherable] and I remember he ask where are you from, why are you running, where is your husband?</span> <span id="s730">Fast.</span> <span id="s731">She say, “My husband is dead, the German killed him.”</span> <span id="s732">And I looked, I -- I didn’t say a word.</span> <span id="s733">And he ask me [speaks Russian here], in Russian.</span> <span id="s734">“Girl, come here, come here, we’ll give you some candies,” and this, and one of the soldier took me and he hugged me.</span> <span id="s735">He say that I have nice long hair, curly hair.</span> <span id="s736">I’m a nice looking girl, and my brother, he was holding us, gave us something to eat.</span> <span id="s737">And he say in Russian, “Where is your father?”</span> <span id="s738">I said, “I don’t know my father.”</span> <span id="s739">I started to cry, “I don’t know, the German took him.”</span> <span id="s740">So he says, “Okay.</span> <span id="s741">We came with the wagon, with the horse and we’re going to tel -- take you to the border.</span> <span id="s742">Whatever you have, gather.</span> <span id="s743">In a half an hour we’re going to take you away from here.</span> <span id="s744">You cannot stay here.”</span> <span id="s745">So the woman, that Polish woman told Mom in Polish that -- don’t be afraid, these Russian soldiers they don’t want any spies in the border because Russia was not at war then --</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: -- with Germany.</span> <span id="s748">But they were very careful.</span> <span id="s749">So they took us on a horse and buggy, and -- over the woods, it was still twilight -- it was like not yet day, you know, like four o’clock, five o’clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s750">And my mother was sitting in the wagon, also spread with the hay, and the horse took us and the soldiers in front with the carabine, you know, with the rifle, and we went.</span> <span id="s751">How long I don’t remember, it was long enough, over the woods, then we came on the sk -- on the skirts of the woods.</span> <span id="s752">There was a city.</span> <span id="s753">I see a city because I remember Warsaw was a big city, big houses and people running, this and that, and he brought us to the synagogue in Bialystok.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s755">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s756">We came with the Russian soldiers, with this, to Bialystok.</span> <span id="s757">In Bialystok it was a big shul.</span> <span id="s758">I remember many, many people, children, men, women.</span> <span id="s759">Everybody yelling, screaming, rushing, ri -- calling names, looking for names, Moishe, Chaim, all kind of Jewish names.</span> <span id="s760">Chani, [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s761">People were looking for one another.</span> <span id="s762">It was a big, big place with benches, you know, and -- and they were looking.</span> <span id="s763">And my mom started to yell my father’s name, Moishe, Moishe, you know, his name.</span> <span id="s764">And all of a sudden somebody came to my mom and say, “Who do you looking for?”</span> <span id="s765">[speaks foreign language here], who you looking for?</span> <span id="s766">She say, “Moishe Szlinger,” she said.</span> <span id="s767">“Oh, Moishe Szlinger, I know, I saw him yesterday.</span> <span id="s768">A tall man, skinny man with dark brown hair?”</span> <span id="s769">“Yes, yes, that’s my husband.”</span> <span id="s770">“I saw him.”</span> <span id="s771">He called another man, and he says, “Do you know where Moishe Szlinger is?</span> <span id="s772">That’s his wife and children.”</span> <span id="s773">He said, “Moishe, yeah, he has to come.</span> <span id="s774">He went somewhere, but he has to come.”</span> <span id="s775">Anyway, my father appeared after awhile, and we were all crazy crying.</span> <span id="s776">I hugged him by the feet because he was a tall man.</span> <span id="s777">And he -- he held my brother in his arm, and my mother, crying, everybody hugging, happy that we are alive.</span> <span id="s778">And he said, okay, now we going to stay here, we’ll find a place.</span> <span id="s779">After two days my mom find a job.</span> <span id="s780">There was a lot of Polish and Jewish rich people in Bialystok.</span> <span id="s781">They spoke Yiddish, Polish and Russian because it was on the border.</span> <span id="s782">To tell you the truth, the -- Bi-Bialystok Jews, according to my mom and father’s story, were not pleasant to us.</span> <span id="s783">They call us in Russian the runner ise -- the runner ups, the runners.</span> <span id="s784">They call it biezency in Russian.</span> <span id="s785">Biezency is people who are running.</span> <span id="s786">Biezency.</span> <span id="s787">So my mom find a job in a very good family.</span> <span id="s788">She was cooking, cleaning, washing, and we were staying with them.</span> <span id="s789">My father left --</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Q: Again?</span></p> <p><span id="s791">A: -- again.</span> <span id="s792">My father was involved with politics, he knew what was going on, that the German are still looking, you know.</span> <span id="s793">Bialystok is still Polish, but any day it can become either Russian, or Germany comes there.</span> <span id="s794">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: So the Russians had not occupied it yet, nor the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">A: No, the Russians, no.</span> <span id="s797">The Russians were in between, you know?</span> <span id="s798">So it was like already end of 1939, winter.</span> <span id="s799">We stood there a few months and then they -- there was rumors, there was writings that if Jews from Poland want to go to Russia to work for a year, they have to sign out papers that they going to be in Russia working, and after a year if they want to stay, they become Russian citizens.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s801">Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A: My father came to my mom and say, “Perla, what do you mean?</span> <span id="s803">To go or not?”</span> <span id="s804">She say, “I’m going.</span> <span id="s805">I don’t want to come to Warsaw because I don’t know if they are alive.</span> <span id="s806">Let’s sign.”</span> <span id="s807">So they signed.</span> <span id="s808">There were people around us, Polish, Russian speaking, and they signed like an affidavit to become Russian citizens and work in Russia.</span> <span id="s809">So they took --</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: So this means that the Russians are actually in Bialystok?</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: In Bialystok, yeah.</span> <span id="s812">There was a border between Poland, and it was like a neutral city.</span> <span id="s813">Everybody was there.</span> <span id="s814">So, there was a big gathering and my father discussed it with the mom.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Q: And did you hear that conversation?</span></p> <p><span id="s816">A: I hear --</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A: -- but I didn’t comprehend what is -- I -- later, when I became older, I ask all the question and we talked about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">A: How we came, why we came.</span> <span id="s821">So my father said to me, we came and we saved our lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">A: And all my brothers and sister went to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s824">But that’s later, I will tell you --</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">A: -- how we found out.</span> <span id="s827">So we signed and they send us to a border town, it’s called Ufa.</span> <span id="s828">It was -- I don’t know what kind -- because they have the oldest countries in Russia separated by this.</span> <span id="s829">Ufa, you ca -- spell it U-f-a.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: It’s [speaks foreign language here].</span> <span

unity.</span> <span id="s835">So we went to Ufa for a year.</span> <span id="s836">They signed to work.</span> <span id="s837">We came there, it was bitter cold, winter, snow up to -- over the head.</span> <span id="s838">They took me and my brother to like a kindergarten.</span> <span id="s839">They c -- it’s a center for children, it’s for six days a week.</span> <span id="s840">The seventh day they could take the children to their homes and return them the next day.</span> <span id="s841">We had food and clothing, whatever.</span> <span id="s842">There were many orphans there.</span> <span id="s843">They call it Yasly, Yasly like a kindergarten for younger children, you know, not -- there is another word for that, too, but it’s for little kids, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Q: So how did your mother and father explain to you, because you’ve not -- you’re not used to being away from them at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">A: I said, we cried.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">Q: You cried.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">A: We cried.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: They had to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: My mom was working like a factory, they were making bricks, from all kind of material and she used to carry this heavy stuff to put it away.</span> <span id="s852">And my father worked also with fire there, th-they were making all kind of ironwork.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">Q: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s854">A: Probably it

bricks, and this, and once the brick fell on her leg and she couldn’t walk, she was in a cast.</span> <span id="s857">And that was for one year.</span> <span id="s858">And I remember on Saturday night

id="s1165">He never was separated, never.</span> <span id="s1166">And since his death, I miss him very much.</span> <span id="s1167">We were very close.</span> <span id="s1168">We had a lot of good memories, and he called me Mama.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">Q: He did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">A: He called --</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">Q: As a -- as a child, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">A: As a child.</span> <span id="s1173">And I beat him up.</span> <span id="s1174">I say, I’m not your mama.</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">Q: You beat him up?</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1177">I say, “Mordechai, don’t call me mama, I’m not your mama.”</span> <span id="s1178">You know, I was seven, eight years old --</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">A: -- how can I be your mama?</span> <span id="s1181">You called me mama.</span> <span id="s1182">So I was angry, and as a child, I -- I wanted to defend myself to be more mature.</span> <span id="s1183">I don’t want you to call me mama, I’m not your mama.</span> <span id="s1184">I’m your sister, Sarah.</span> <span id="s1185">We spoke Russian then.</span> <span id="s1186">We -- with my mom we spoke Yiddish and Polish and with him, he was little, he didn’t know Yiddish or Polish then, spoke Russian to me.</span> <span id="s1187">So we spoke Russian.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">Q: So did he change?</span> <span id="s1189">Did he call you sister?</span> <span id="s1190">Or did he always call you mama?</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">A: Oh yeah, later on, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">A: He -- you saw the pictures, a very big man, very caring, very lovely, good looking man.</span> <span id="s1194">He has -- I -- I miss him very much.</span> <span id="s1195">My brother died of cancer of the liver, and he had diabetes.</span> <span id="s1196">And the last time I visited Israel in November, and I si -- I took him to the Dead Sea, to -- I knew he is sick, to give him some good time together, because my younger sister, who was so spoiled by us, we were taking care of her as a child, has no feelings.</span> <span id="s1197">And she doesn’t even talk to -- she didn’t talk to my brother, and doesn’t talk to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">A: I don’t understand.</span> <span id="s1200">We are from the same parents, and everybody has a different attitude.</span> <span id="s1201">Maybe because me and my brother were always attached to the hip because of the war, because of being by ourselves.</span> <span id="s1202">We didn’t have any trauma, no -- no problems to be with one another, always looked for me.</span> <span id="s1203">Even when I was 14 - 15 in Poland, used to go out with boys, and have friends and he always wanted to come to me.</span> <span id="s1204">I chased him away.</span> <span id="s1205">I said, “Go home.”</span> <span id="s1206">“I will tell Mom that you’re going out with boys.”</span> <span id="s1207">I said, “All right.</span> <span id="s1208">I’m going out with boys, these are my friends, you go home.”</span> <span id="s1209">It was very hard to separate him from me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">A: But we were very close all the time, even though I went to America, and he in Israel, we always kept in touch.</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">A: He married twice, he had the first wife, that’s -- you saw the picture, Tamara, she’s from Morocco Jews, Moroccan Jews, a nice family.</span> <span id="s1214">They have two children, a daughter, Anat, she’s now 46 or something, and named a son, Moishe, after my father, Mojes -- Moishe in Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1215">And Moishe has two beautiful daughters.</span> <span id="s1216">And now it was born on my brother’s birthday, December 14, 2006, a boy was born, looks exactly like my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">A: And they call him Mordechai Eli, and I spoke to them, they say that he is a copy of Mordechai.</span> <span id="s1219">I hope to see them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">Q: I hope so too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">A: I hope to see them.</span> <span id="s1222">Very lovely, I love them very much, and I am a very family oriented person.</span> <span id="s1223">I love my fa-family, I like my children, my grandchildren, everybody.</span> <span id="s1224">I don’t have grudges against nobody because my life was hard and I now will not concentrate on being angry at somebody or being against somebody or hating somebody.</span> <span id="s1225">I always find love in my heart for other people to be helpful.</span> <span id="s1226">And I miss my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">Q: Right, I bet you do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">A: I miss him very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">Q: Do y -- do you remember the day your father left to go to the Russian army?</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">Q: What was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">A: We didn’t understand too much.</span> <span id="s1233">My mom cried.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">Q: You were six.</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">Q: 1941, right?</span> <span id="s1237">So you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">Q: -- were six years old.</span> <span id="s1240">Or five.</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">A: He was a tall, nice looking man, slim.</span> <span id="s1242">And he said to us not to cry.</span> <span id="s1243">He hugged me, my brother, my mom, he said it wou -- “The war will not last long, and I will be back.</span> <span id="s1244">You just be good to one another, help your mom, and be good to your brother.”</span> <span id="s1245">I say, “Yes, I will, but I want you to come back.”</span> <span id="s1246">He say, “I will.”</span> <span id="s1247">So, when he left for the army, we didn’t know anything where he is, what he is doing, no letters, nothing.</span> <span id="s1248">We did not receive.</span> <span id="s1249">So, when my -- the war started in ’41, we stayed a few months with the -- in the Ukraine with that woman, Babushka we call her, grandma.</span> <span id="s1250">She was a very nice person, but my mom say, “I’m not going to stay in Ukraine.”</span> <span id="s1251">I -- she say, “Why Perlina?”</span> <span id="s1252">Perlina -- she was Perla in Yiddish, but in Russian they call her Perlina.</span> <span id="s1253">And -- “Why?</span> <span id="s1254">Stay here.</span> <span id="s1255">We’ll take care of the children, you will work.”</span> <span id="s1256">My mom say, I have -- she told me later, “I have memory from my father, born in Kiev, and telling me stories about anti-Semitism in Ukraine, how much they were against Jews.”</span> <span id="s1257">And they collaborated with the Germans, Ukraines, a lot of them.</span> <span id="s1258">So my mother remembered that, her father’s story, and she evacuated.</span> <span id="s1259">There was like a Jewish Polish organization that they provided.</span> <span id="s1260">So we were staying in a different place, and I don’t remember exactly, not long.</span> <span id="s1261">And then we find out -- oh, my father’s brother, Yukel, and his wife, and daughter and son were living in Magnito Gorsk.</span> <span id="s1262">It’s in Ural.</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">A: They found that my father was wounded, and he was living in Shchyokino, two -- near the forest --</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">Q: Near Tula.</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">A: Tula.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">A: So, somehow he -- he tried, my mother tried to write and there was like a Polish organization.</span> <span id="s1269">There was a Polish writer woman, was named Wanda Waszylewska.</span> <span id="s1270">You call it with a W, Wanda Waszylewska.</span> <span id="s1271">She was a writer and very active for Jews and Polish people to come together to live like a Polish society.</span> <span id="s1272">And through her we find where my father is and through my -- my uncle that they were keeping track of Jewish people and Polish people from Poland.</span> <span id="s1273">And we traveled, and my mom, my -- me, my -- my brother in trains, it was very far away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">Q: Yes, I imagine, from --</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1276">We traveled all over Russia.</span> <span id="s1277">They were not elegant trains, it was like cattle trains.</span> <span id="s1278">Hay in the middle, and there was a little stove, not to keep -- to keep warm, not cold.</span> <span id="s1279">So one day we had bread that was like put in the oven, and like toasted.</span> <span id="s1280">Dry bread toasted in a sack.</span> <span id="s1281">And we were transferred from one train to another, and Mom gave me the sack to hold on my back, that sack with bread.</span> <span id="s1282">It was not that heavy because it was dry, it was not heavy.</span> <span id="s1283">And pef -- people were running and pushing to go into the trains, and -- cattle train actually, it was very high up, there was no steps down, nothing.</span> <span id="s1284">They did not provide any luxury for the refugees.</span> <span id="s1285">And I remember somebody pulled me up to the train and my mom was behind and pushing my brother up.</span> <span id="s1286">So I held my brother’s hand and in one hand I had the sack.</span> <span id="s1287">All of a sudden I feel light, there is no sack.</span> <span id="s1288">Somebody took it away, we never find it.</span> <span id="s1289">We cried.</span> <span id="s1290">We didn’t have our chlebushka, you know, like my brother cried, Mama, chlebushka?</span> <span id="s1291">Mama, give me bread.</span> <span id="s1292">He was always hungry and he always cried.</span> <span id="s1293">Chlebushka.</span> <span id="s1294">I call him chlebushka always, you know?</span> <span id="s1295">That -- that was the Russian word for bread, but in a very nickname like -- like endearing.</span> <span id="s1296">It’s called chleb in Russian.</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">Q: Bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">A: But chlebushka is something like -- like somebody you love, you call babushka, like this, you know, they --</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">A: -- add.</span> <span id="s1301">So that was chlebushka for him, and we didn’t have it.</span> <span id="s1302">Imagine in such a situation, people running, hungry, somebody steals from a child, that sack with the -- we call it suchary, suchary, that dry bread.</span> <span id="s1303">And we didn’t have what to eat, and the train was going and going with no stop.</span> <span id="s1304">We didn’t know where we going.</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">Q: Oh, you weren't sure where you were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">A: Mm-mm, we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1307">And when it stopped, everybody run out, because people -- excuse, were relieving themself on the hay there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">A: On the straw.</span> <span id="s1310">So when there’s a train stop, we have to get -- jump down and go pee or do some other things.</span> <span id="s1311">And sometime the train all of a sudden start moving.</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">A: So my mom threw me to one wagon, my brother too, and somebody grabbed her by the hand to pull her to another wagon.</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">Q: Into another wagon.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">A: And the train goes and goes, how long we don’t know, and we cry, Mama, Mama, we both cry.</span> <span id="s1316">And finally, after a few hours it stops, so my mom came running to us, hugged us.</span> <span id="s1317">We cried, because we were happy to see.</span> <span id="s1318">So my mom say, never again we go, we always keep hands together.</span> <span id="s1319">Whatever happen, happen.</span> <span id="s1320">And the trains, at the station, they had hot water.</span> <span id="s1321">They call it in Russian kipiatok, kipiatok it’s like boiling water.</span> <span id="s1322">And we get the hot water and whoever had a piece of bread put it in that water so we have something warm to -- to have for the stomach, you know?</span> <span id="s1323">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">Q: But you didn’t have any food?</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">A: No.</span> <span id="s1326">But they gave us some, Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">Q: They did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">A: A piece of bread a day, or whatever, they gave us some, so we save for the next day.</span> <span id="s1331">I always saved bread.</span> <span id="s1332">I cut like a small piece and put under the pillow, it was not a pillow like here, soft and comfortable.</span> <span id="s1333">Something that you put under your head, and I always kept a piece of bread hidden.</span> <span id="s1334">And when my brother cried for chlebushka, to get bread, I always got a piece and gave it to him, and he was satisfied and happy.</span> <span id="s1335">We were very attached to one another.</span> <span id="s1336">And then we come, after months of traveling, we come to Tula.</span> <span id="s1337">That’s the city not far from Moscow, that city Tula, and from Tula the organizat-zation, a Polish organization brought us together and they transfer us to Shchyokino, where my father was, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">Q: So your father was not in Tula --</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">Q: -- he was in Shchyokino.</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">A: It was cold in the Russian Gora Shchyokino, the city of Shchyokino, and Tulskaya Obles, Tula like -- like Washington [indecipherable] Maryland, yeah?</span> <span id="s1342">That was the region.</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">A: Tulskaya Obles, the -- the suburbs or whatever, of Tula.</span> <span id="s1345">Tula was not far away, but it was a nice, big city, because later we went there.</span> <span id="s1346">And my father lived in a place called in Russian obszy zycie, it’s communal life, communal life like a community in barracks.</span> <span id="s1347">Everybody had a bed like two, four or five people in one room, with a small petition like in the hospital, you know, they have this curtain --</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">Q: Curtain.</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">A: -- on the bed, and -- and we didn’t see our father for a long time, I didn’t recognize him.</span> <span id="s1350">He got -- he was wounded in the -- in his leg, so he limped a little bit.</span> <span id="s1351">But he got skinny and not the father I remember.</span> <span id="s1352">And we were also children that grew a little bit and got skinny, without hair.</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">Q: So you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">A: So we all cried.</span> <span id="s1355">We cried.</span> <span id="s1356">It was like kind of frightened of him, the way he looked.</span> <span id="s1357">And he cried to find us and my mom.</span> <span id="s1358">And life started.</span> <span id="s1359">So, as a family, we got a little room, separate from the place where he stayed single.</span> <span id="s1360">We got a little room, a long, little co -- like the same width, but longer, with one window, two beds with straw mattresses and a stove in the middle, like they call it [speaks Russian here], the Russian stove that you burn on coal or wood, and no gas.</span> <span id="s1361">And no running water, never in the house, not --</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">Q: You haven’t had running water for a very long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">A: We used to carry, my mom -- in the Russia, if you see Russian old movies, you have like a -- a wooden [indecipherable] like it’s half round and it has two hooks, one hook for one pail, and the other, and you carry it on your shoulder like this, with the -- I used to carry that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1368">But smaller buckets, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">Q: Right, because you were smaller.</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">A: I used to sit down, kneel it -- kneel, and then pick it up with my shoulder, and stand up.</span> <span id="s1371">And of course the water was -- because I was shaking, not steady on my legs, so this was spilling, you know, spill.</span> <span id="s1372">But I run, barefoot, and was summertime, and we didn’t have clothes enough and my mom, from whatever she could do over her clothes she sew for me like a sarafan, you know, like with no sleeves underneath, you wear a blouse and whatever.</span> <span id="s1373">And that’s what -- and barefoot all summer long we run barefoot, and I had a glass splinters in my legs, and wood in my legs, and you ask he -- I looked like a tomboy.</span> <span id="s1374">I was very active.</span> <span id="s1375">My hair was shaven, still cor -- short, didn’t have hair.</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">A: Just a little bit in front, like here, and straight, with freckles.</span> <span id="s1378">I still have freckles, I cover them with --</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">Q: Not too many.</span> <span id="s1380">You cover them up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">A: -- with make-up a little bit.</span> <span id="s1382">With freckles, my brother also had freckles.</span> <span id="s1383">I even have on my hands freckles.</span> <span id="s1384">But -- and then we were happy to be together with my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">Q: How long did it take you to get used to your father again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">A: Oh, it took awhile, months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">Q: It did?</span> <span id="s1388">A: I -- yeah.</span> <span id="s1389">And he --</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">Q: Were you frightened of him in some way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">A: No, we were not frightened.</span> <span id="s1392">It just -- he was not the same person like we remember, warm and loving.</span> <span id="s1393">He was like keeping distance from the army, from being wounded, and he start drinking, and the -- they taught him how to drink alcohol.</span> <span id="s1394">He started to drink, so -- he worked very hard, he worked with iron.</span> <span id="s1395">They were melting iron in a big factory, and making like all kind of -- I don’t know, ammunition or whatever, parts or whatever.</span> <span id="s1396">He worked very hard, and they were rationing us with bread.</span> <span id="s1397">So while he was working very hard, a physical job, he got a ration of bread daily, a kilo bread.</span> <span id="s1398">Kilo bread is like two -- two and something pounds.</span> <span id="s1399">A kilo bread.</span> <span id="s1400">My mom had a half of it, half a kilo bread, and we got together, me and my brother, half a kilo.</span> <span id="s1401">So we had two kilo breads, which you will think it’s a lot, yeah, it’s like a loaf of bread for four people.</span> <span id="s1402">But except bread, we didn’t have anything to eat.</span> <span id="s1403">We didn’t have butter, we didn’t have marmalade, we didn’t have any butter or whatever.</span> <span id="s1404">And my mom used to say, in Yiddish she say, “God, when I am going to eat a piece of white bread with butter?”</span> <span id="s1405">I looked at her, “Mama, what is butter?”</span> <span id="s1406">[speaks foreign language here].</span> <span id="s1407">You know it?</span> <span id="s1408">That’s what she wanted.</span> <span id="s1409">White bread --</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">Q: Bread with butter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">A: -- with butter.</span> <span id="s1412">Then I went to school --</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">Q: Tell me something.</span> <span id="s1414">Were you sick at all, you and -- besides the malaria --</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">Q: -- because of not getting proper nutrition?</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s1418">At this place, we got sick with the eyes.</span> <span id="s1419">My a -- my eyes and my brother’s eyes, when it come evening, we didn’t see anything.</span> <span id="s1420">Why -- and his eyes got swollen with a lot of pus coming out, like -- like this, like balloons.</span> <span id="s1421">My -- we didn’t see, we were walking like blind, like this, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">Q: At night?</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">A: In the evening, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">Q: Evening.</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">A: Stretching my brother behind me, holding me like this, and I was walking like --</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">Q: What was [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">A: -- like a zombie.</span> <span id="s1428">We didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1429">Later I find out.</span> <span id="s1430">My mother took us to the doctors there, to a clinic and they used to put very strong drops into our eyes.</span> <span id="s1431">It was burning like hell.</span> <span id="s1432">We cried just that when she touched us.</span> <span id="s1433">They put drops and she washed our eyes with some lukewarm water, with the nice cleaning, you know, ma -- fabric.</span> <span id="s1434">So she wiped our eyes.</span> <span id="s1435">During the day it was fine, we could see.</span> <span id="s1436">When evening came -- they call it in Russian -- I will say and then translate kurina slepota.</span> <span id="s1437">Kurina means chicken blindness.</span> <span id="s1438">That’s how they call it.</span> <span id="s1439">It was not a professional medical name.</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">A: But that was the symptoms that a lot of people, usually children, had because we didn’t have vitamins, we didn’t have proper food and hygiene, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">A: So that’s -- children were dying like flies there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1444">Q: Of

sickness.</span> <span id="s1449">They were swollen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">Q: They had what sickness?</span> <span id="s1451">Whe --</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">A: Brain.</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">Q: Brain.</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">A: The brain -- was attacking the children’s brain, they died like flies.</span> <span id="s1455">We -- remember that every other day we lived in a barrack, it was -- each one had their own, like 30 families and we knew one another.</span> <span id="s1456">Every other day there was a -- a funeral for the children.</span> <span id="s1457">And one family, two, three kids died.</span> <span id="s1458">They got swollen and this and brain damage or whatever, fever, and they died.</span> <span id="s1459">And you know, out of this sadness, we run to the cemetery because there was a tradition that when they buried somebody, they gave you a little bit -- a small piece of bread with honey.</span> <span id="s1460">And this for us, it’s irony, it’s sad, was like a holiday to get a piece of bread with honey, we never saw honey.</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">A: And that was a tradition.</span> <span id="s1463">And they were buried, a lot of friends I remember, in particular one little girl with blue eyes, her name was Nina.</span> <span id="s1464">And then her brother, younger brother died, too.</span> <span id="s1465">But life must go on.</span> <span id="s1466">We had -- I went to school -- I went to second grade, third grade.</span> <span id="s1467">I learned very fast Russian, to write in Russian and read.</span> <span id="s1468">We didn’t have books, or didn’t have paper to write, like you have nice paper.</span> <span id="s1469">My father cut up from the newspaper the white side, sewed it up with the needle and thread and I used to write on this my homework and everything.</span> <span id="s1470">I-It’s not a fairy tale --</span></p> <p><span

Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">A: We call it clocks</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">Q: Especially on the newspaper it would spread.</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">Q: We have to stop the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1491">Oh my God.</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">End of Tape Four</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">Beginning Tape Five</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">Q: We ended where you were going to school, but I want to go back to all of these sicknesses and the children dying.</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">Q: Was this very hard on you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">A: Very.</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">Q: -- to see all these children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">Q: Were you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">A: We were actually very scared.</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">A: And especially my parents.</span> <span id="s1504">You couldn’t help it, what’s -- was happening, it was like an epidemic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">A: And young children were dying.</span> <span id="s1507">Nobody could explain why and how it comes, they just got swollen, got high fever, like a brain fever or whatever, and then the next day or two they were gone.</span> <span id="s1508">And was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">Q: So it was really fast, also?</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">A: It was fast, it was fast and there were too many children age six, seven, like that, died.</span> <span id="s1511">And out of that tragedy that I understand today, we were happy to run to the cemetery to get this piece of bread with honey.</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1513">So it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">A: Can you imagine --</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">Q: Yes, I can imagine --</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">A: -- that survival --</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">Q: -- what survival does.</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">A: -- that survival does.</span> <span id="s1519">We were crying.</span> <span id="s1520">I remember that Ninotchka -- her name was Ninotchka with blue eyes, blonde hair, Russian child, was beautiful, always playing, she was chubby.</span> <span id="s1521">And I was the skinny one and the mother sometime brought me a piece of potato, like baked in the oven.</span> <span id="s1522">They call it kartoshka in Russian.</span> <span id="s1523">And they were very nice people, Russian people, the peasants or whatever.</span> <span id="s1524">They were very hospitable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">A: Very nice people.</span> <span id="s1527">And we live like brothers and sisters, we played.</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">Q: Then she died.</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">A: A lot.</span> <span id="s1532">And then her little brother died, too [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1533">I remem --</span></p> <p><span id="s1534">Q: Were you scared?</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">A: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">Q: You were scared.</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">A: But we didn’t understand about dead too much, because they said -- they were very religious, the people, the Russian and they said that they go to heaven.</span> <span id="s1538">I ask my mom what is heaven because we were not religious at all.</span> <span id="s1539">We knew Jewish, we knew we Jewish, and my mom say, “In heaven it’s a place of like beautiful trees, beautiful green flowers and nice weather and all the people are happy and playing together, children, so she went to heaven.”</span> <span id="s1540">So one day I cry, I say, “I don’t want to go to heaven.”</span> <span id="s1541">She say, “Why?”</span> <span id="s1542">I say, “Because she’s not around here.</span> <span id="s1543">I miss her and if I go to heaven I will not see you or my brother.”</span> <span id="s1544">I already started to think about things like that.</span> <span id="s1545">I say, “I don’t want to go to heaven, I want to be here with you.”</span> <span id="s1546">And my mom hugged me, she say, “Okay Surele, you’re not going to heaven.</span> <span id="s1547">You’re growing old here, and this is the hell.”</span> <span id="s1548">So we live -- we are in hell now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">Q: Did you get sick again, or was it the eye sickness, maybe --</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">A: No, after the eye sickness, we were eating better, because my mom worked and my father worked, and they had a lot of -- we didn’t have enough bread probably, but there was on the market always, potatoes, or a carrot to buy and this, and she cooked soup, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">A: She cooked a lot of soup with bread, if you can.</span> <span id="s1553">And so we put a piece of bread like this, in the spoon like that, it was dripping --</span></p> <p><span id="s1554">Q: Dripping onto the bread</span></p> <p><span id="s1555">A: -- so we don’t lose the liquid, so it went on the bread, and then the bread was, you know, e-eaten.</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">A: It was very dear, like a commodity.</span> <span id="s1558">If you give me today gold, I will not cherish that like that piece of bread and soup.</span> <span id="s1559">Then my sister came.</span> <span id="s1560">We did not know that Mom is pregnant and I did not understand.</span> <span id="s1561">I was already nine years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">A: It was ’45, ni -- April of ’45, and my mom got sick.</span> <span id="s1564">We thought that my mom is going to die, me and my brother, we cried.</span> <span id="s1565">We didn’t know, they didn’t tell us what sh -- what is -- I saw my mom a little bit rounded like she is gaining weight.</span> <span id="s1566">Looks good, and she worked, and that was all, you know?</span> <span id="s1567">In the meantime, in the summer, I was running with the girls, dancing, they had music or they play and dance, you know the Russian folks dances, they -- they sing chastushki, chastushki means like the -- the couplets, like the words that -- the folk songs about girls and boys loving one another and this and singing.</span> <span id="s1568">I remember the songs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">Q: [indecipherable] can you sing one of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1570">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">Q: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">A: [sings in Russian]</span></p> <p><span id="s1573">Q: So what does that mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">A: Oh, that’s what -- like pay attention to that song, put your ears on top of your head so you hear better, because they going to sing that folk song chastushki -- there is no explanation what chastushki is, so it will be -- you will be very happy about that.</span> <span id="s1575">And then you make ee-ee noises and dance and you’re like this, like that, you know, the Russian folks dancer, have you seen sometime Russian folk dancers --</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">Q: Really [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1577">A: -- or th-they’re -- they’re very like country songs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">A: Right, like square dancers?</span> <span id="s1580">That’s -- that’s what, very nice, and I was an expert in that with the girls.</span> <span id="s1581">Always Szurka, Szurka, they call me Szurka, [indecipherable] go dance.</span> <span id="s1582">I say no, I was shy in the beginning.</span> <span id="s1583">But then I -- I dance and sang.</span> <span id="s1584">Barefoot, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">Q: Always barefoot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">A: We didn’t have shoes.</span> <span id="s1587">So, it was very happy, and there were bigger girls, and in summertime they had woods, beautiful woods -- forest.</span> <span id="s1588">They used to go summertime to the forest, the girls, like they were maybe 12 - 14 or older.</span> <span id="s1589">Nice Russian girls, only girls, going to the woods to pick berries, they had white berries, wild.</span> <span id="s1590">Wild nuts growing, with the green things.</span> <span id="s1591">And sometimes we had, like in the spring, on the fields, some potatoes leftover from the previous years, so they were frozen from the winter, we picked.</span> <span id="s1592">So I told my mom, make a sack.</span> <span id="s1593">From a sack, make like a -- a -- like a rucksack, to have strings here --</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">Q: So you can put them in a bag.</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">A: -- so put it together, string it, and I have it on my bag, whatever I pick.</span> <span id="s1596">And then she gave me a big container with the close-up, you know, and a mu -- a long one, like a pail, and [indecipherable] in the summer, four -- four o’clock in the summer, the girls didn’t want to take me with them.</span> <span id="s1597">They were older and they were afraid that I will start crying, I will be tired, so they always when they saw me, Szurka, go home.</span> <span id="s1598">You not coming with us to the woods.</span> <span id="s1599">We’re not going to take, there is a bridge to cross, there is water, you can fall in.</span> <span id="s1600">We don’t want you.</span> <span id="s1601">But I will pick for you.</span> <span id="s1602">I will help you pick berries, everything.</span> <span id="s1603">Please take me.</span> <span id="s1604">I will not cry.</span> <span id="s1605">No, you go home.</span> <span id="s1606">So what I do?</span> <span id="s1607">I told my mom, I was crying, I say “They don’t want to take me.”</span> <span id="s1608">And she say, “They’re right.</span> <span id="s1609">You a little girl and you don’t go there, we don’t need that.”</span> <span id="s1610">I say, “Mom, I am going.”</span> <span id="s1611">So what I did, I woke up earlier, like two o’clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s1612">I didn’t sleep probably a whole night, and it was like grayish outside, in the summer, i-it’s like April, May, something, I was going.</span> <span id="s1613">I went by myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">Q: Through the woods.</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">A: Through the woods.</span> <span id="s1616">I knew the way and I was far away ahead of them, and when they saw me, they chased me with -- with rocks.</span> <span id="s1617">I said, do whatever, I am on my own, not going with you.</span> <span id="s1618">I am going by myself.</span> <span id="s1619">This is my woods too.</span> <span id="s1620">You know, I was then not letting do anything to me.</span> <span id="s1621">So I picked -- first what I did, I ate the berries, whatever they grow.</span> <span id="s1622">The toot -- the blueberries, and all kind of berries, the raspberries, everything.</span> <span id="s1623">First what I did, I ate.</span> <span id="s1624">I stuffed my face with it, I was all red around, I didn’t care, it was good.</span> <span id="s1625">Then I picked the -- from the trees the nuts with the green covers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">A: Put in the sack, and put mushrooms.</span> <span id="s1628">I pick mushroom.</span> <span id="s1629">I knew each mushroom by name and which mushroom is poisonous.</span> <span id="s1630">I learned from them.</span> <span id="s1631">So I put the mushrooms in this.</span> <span id="s1632">And there was also wild, like -- it was like -- no, green -- no, how you call it, the green chives?</span></p> <p><span id="s1633">Q: Oh, chives, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">A: The green chives?</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">A: But that was wild.</span> <span id="s1637">But it looks the same.</span> <span id="s1638">I pulled it out with the roots.</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">A: It has a little head, white head, I put it in the sack.</span> <span id="s1641">Everything, I brought home, whatever the -- and the mushrooms and everything.</span> <span id="s1642">I even learned to eat raw mushrooms then.</span> <span id="s1643">I ate.</span> <span id="s1644">I picked up everything, I helped them to pick, there -- there was a river, they went swimming in the river, washing up, washing the mushrooms, everything.</span> <span id="s1645">And we had a picnic.</span> <span id="s1646">We were singing and dancing together.</span> <span id="s1647">I never was behind them, I never let them be, you know, letting me down.</span> <span id="s1648">And I -- I -- that was good memories for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">Q: So you did -- so you went with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">A: Later they accepted me, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1651">Q: They did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">A: They accepted, they were waiting for me, I was waiting before them.</span> <span id="s1653">They accepted me.</span> <span id="s1654">And then they didn’t know about who we are, Jewish, they call us we are Polacks.</span> <span id="s1655">We are Polish refugee.</span> <span id="s1656">There was no anti-Semitism there then.</span> <span id="s1657">They didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1658">Maybe it’s because of a small place, they didn’t know that we are Jews or that -- they call me Szurka, that’s -- that was a Russian name.</span> <span id="s1659">Surele my mom called me, and Szurka in Russian.</span> <span id="s1660">So it’s -- it’s a short name from Alexandra in Russian.</span></p> <p><span id="s1661">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">A: Alexandra means they called Szura as a nickname, you know?</span> <span id="s1663">So I was Szurka.</span> <span id="s1664">And when I came home, my mom saw all this [indecipherable] so she say in Yiddish -- my mom was very frighten about poisonous things, so she say, [speaks Yiddish here].</span> <span id="s1665">“What happened?</span> <span id="s1666">Like a disease, she’s going to poison us all with all this stuff she brought.</span> <span id="s1667">You know, who is going to do?</span> <span id="s1668">I said, “I know how to do.”</span> <span id="s1669">I cleaned it, the mushrooms.</span> <span id="s1670">We cut the mushrooms.</span> <span id="s1671">If we had the -- the sibilus, the yel -- the green thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">Q: The chives?</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">A: Chives, we call it sibilus in Yiddish, cebula in Polish.</span> <span id="s1674">And wi -- my mom washed it, she chopped it and put water and put the mushrooms.</span> <span id="s1675">We didn’t have any grease or butter, whatever.</span> <span id="s1676">It was a good soup with bread, and we all ate.</span> <span id="s1677">And that was summer, we were not hungry, and happy.</span> <span id="s1678">And I had a good time with them, they -- they learned to respect me, to dance and sing gu -- together.</span> <span id="s1679">And they were going out with boys of course, they were older than me and then was one man -- wa -- young boy, Pyeta was his name, he liked me to be his girlfriend.</span> <span id="s1680">I didn't understand that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1681">Q: But you were 10 years old [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1682">A: Yes, I said -- they started young then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1683">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1684">A: Some of them even were pregnant, the girls, they didn’t care if there was a husband, and --</span></p> <p><span

id="s1689">And a lot of tragedies --</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1691">A: -- you know, but that was life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">Q: Yo-You didn’t have shoes?</span> <span id="s1693">This was [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">A: No, barefoot, barefoot.</span> <span id="s1695">All summer barefoot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1696">Q: And in the winter, what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1697">A: In the winter I was wearing my mom’s shoes.</span> <span id="s1698">I’ll tell you what happened in April when my sister was supposed to get born.</span> <span id="s1699">My mom was pregnant and my father used to work night shifts.</span> <span id="s1700">It was like 24 hours, from time when he went to work, it was like 24 hours, then he came home.</span> <span id="s1701">He was earning good money, and bread, you know.</span> <span id="s1702">There was rations, bread.</span> <span id="s1703">So one night in the morning, it was like two o’clock in the morning, my s -- mother started to -- I don’t know how you say in English, is [Yiddish word] like in Yiddish, oy, oy, she was moaning.</span> <span id="s1704">I said, “Mama, what

woke me up, Surele, Surele.</span> <span id="s1709">When there was something wrong, she spoke to me in Yiddish, not in Russian, you know?</span> <span id="s1710">So I woke up, I say, “Mama, what

lady.</span> <span id="s1715">It was like from our place to go through a railroad that was a slope going up -- up, and there was a railroad and then you go down to the village, and I knew where she lived, the babushka.</span> <span id="s1716">So, it was almost three in the morning, I run, and it was April.</span> <span id="s1717">It was raining before, it was mud all over because the roads were not paved, there were no roads in the village.</span> <span id="s1718">And I put my mother’s shoes, of course, her size was, I think, 39 then, and I was little.</span> <span id="s1719">I put my mother’s shoes, and I’m running.</span> <span id="s1720">I put something on myself, I don’t remember what I put, something, and I running and crying, running and crying.</span> <span id="s1721">And that -- my mother should not die, my mother should not die, my mother is sick.</span> <span id="s1722">I go fast to -- to get babushka, she will help her.</span> <span id="s1723">So, the babushka lived in a small hut also, nobody had a hou -- tall houses, nobody.</span> <span id="s1724">It was a barrack, one room and that’s it.</span> <span id="s1725">No luxuries.</span> <span id="s1726">So I knocked in the window, in the babushka’s window.</span> <span id="s1727">M -- she was prepared.</span> <span id="s1728">She told my mother, if something happened to you, send Szuritska -- send Szura to call me, and I will come.</span> <span id="s1729">So, I knocked in the window a few times, nobody answer, and I start screaming, “Babushka, Babushka, come, my mom is dying.”</span> <span id="s1730">In Russian [speaks Russian].</span> <span id="s1731">I -- I thought my mom is dying.</span> <span id="s1732">So she say, Szurka, like this, she was an old woman -- I don’t know, maybe she was not old then.</span> <span id="s1733">She was wearing that scarf on the head.</span> <span id="s1734">A short woman, blue eyes, I remember her.</span> <span id="s1735">We call her babushka, we didn’t know the name.</span> <span id="s1736">And the babushka came out, she said to me, “Relax, what happened?”</span> <span id="s1737">I say, “Mama is dying, Mama is in pain, Mama is dying.</span> <span id="s1738">She send me to you to come.”</span> <span id="s1739">Okay.</span> <span id="s1740">So we’re running, running, and there is water, dark, and my mother’s shoes were stuck in the mud, and I left it there.</span> <span id="s1741">I didn’t have time to go back to ge-get it, so I took the other shoe off, I’m barefoot, I run, and I remember where that shoe is, you know?</span> <span id="s1742">So, my mom’s shoes, and she came to the room, she saw my mother, she took me and my brother out, pushed us out of the door.</span> <span id="s1743">And she said, “Stay here, don’t come in.”</span> <span id="s1744">We don’t know what happened to Mom, we crying.</span> <span id="s1745">My brother even more than me, he was crying.</span> <span id="s1746">He say, “What happened to mom, she is going to die.”</span> <span id="s1747">I said, “Don’t worry Mordechai.</span> <span id="s1748">Stay put quiet, be quiet.</span> <span id="s1749">We won’t -- we don’t know, maybe she will not die.</span> <span id="s1750">The babushka will help.”</span> <span id="s1751">We -- I don’t know how long we stayed, a few hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s1752">Q: And your brother is about

eat.</span> <span id="s1776">So she said, the babushka, “This is your little sister.”</span> <span id="s1777">Now we -- we were happy that Mom didn’t die, but there was a sister, we didn’t know how it comes, why?</span> <span id="s1778">So, we went in -- I went with babushka back, I got that shoe, I didn’t forget -- forget my shoe --</span></p> <p><span id="s1779">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span

you hear about death factories?</span></p> <p><span id="s1859">A: Yeah, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1860">Q: You do?</span> <span id="s1861">In -- in Russia, you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1862">A: Yeah, yes.</span> <span id="s1863">People actually came before the war ended, wounded men without legs, invalids, without an arm, without an eye.</span> <span id="s1864">So people ask, what happened to you?</span> <span id="s1865">And since it was an open community that we lived, and I was going to school, and there were also Russian propaganda, and they were telling about concentration camps, I knew about Auschwitz, Dachau --</span></p> <p><span id="s1866">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1867">A: -- Treblinka, yeah.</span> <span id="s1868">But I did not understand

Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1872">A: And when we came back to Poland after that, and we came in July of ’45, we came to Poland, it took a few months after the war, not too long, because of the organization and w-we came to the city, not to Warsaw where my -- my father and mom was born, we came to Wroclaw, it was before Germany --</span></p> <p><span id="s1873">Q: Breslau.</span></p> <p><span id="s1874">A: Breslau.</span></p> <p><span id="s1875">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1876">A: Th-They call it [speaks foreign language here] taking over land.</span> <span id="s1877">It used to belong to Silesia.</span> <span id="s1878">In Silesia they call it Shlonsk in Poland.</span> <span id="s1879">There’s upper Silesia and middle Silesia in German, there’s a higher and lower Silesia.</span> <span id="s1880">It still now belonged to Poland.</span> <span id="s1881">That’s why we came.</span> <span id="s1882">We came to Wroclaw, a torn down, burned down city, huge city in ruins.</span> <span id="s1883">We came because my father’s brother Yukel with his family was there.</span> <span id="s1884">They met us, Luba, my cousin, his daughter, Yukel’s daughter, and the boy, Mordechai met us.</span> <span id="s1885">So my father ask, where is my brother, Yukel?</span> <span id="s1886">So she burst into tears and she said that he is no more.</span> <span id="s1887">He died a month ago.</span> <span id="s1888">He had tuberculosis, he was very sick and his wife Gitl died in Russia before that.</span> <span id="s1889">So he came to Poland with the two children.</span> <span id="s1890">Luba was a lot older than me, 10 years older, and Mordechai, my cousin is two years older than me.</span> <span id="s1891">So we came and the two, girl and boy had an apartment where they live and -- with the father.</span> <span id="s1892">We came to their apartment, the four of us, how many -- five of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1893">Q: Five of you now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1894">A: Yeah, my sister was there, the baby, a few months old.</span> <span id="s1895">She was born in April, that was July something, so she was a few months old, and we came to live with them.</span> <span id="s1896">We didn’t have anything, no clothes, no nothing, no shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1897">Q: So you came very quickly after the war --</span></p> <p><span id="s1898">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1899">Q: -- you didn’t wait in Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1900">A: My father didn’t want to stay one single day longer and my mom.</span> <span id="s1901">They wanted to come home and seek if somebody is still alive, because we corresponded with them.</span> <span id="s1902">They got letters in Russia from Warsaw up to 1943.</span> <span id="s1903">They were writing -- that’s what my mom told me in Yiddish, that they have to leave their apartments, and they going to give them another apartments, all Jews together, it’s -- it was a ghetto creating in Warsaw, but they didn't know any better what will happen to them.</span> <span id="s1904">So don’t worry about us, the apartment that you left with the things is intact.</span> <span id="s1905">We closed the doors and everything is being checked, and nobody touched anything.</span> <span id="s1906">That was so important to them, the apartment with the furniture.</span></p> <p><span id="s1907">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1908">A: To us it was not relevant then.</span> <span id="s1909">What we went through, running away and leaving things -- while running you leave the heavy stuff because you cannot carry it.</span> <span id="s1910">So -- and that was the end and we did not see one of them, nobody was alive.</span> <span id="s1911">They all perished in the Warsaw ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1912">Q: Did you go to war -- did your parents and you go to Warsaw first --</span></p> <p><span id="s1913">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1914">Q: -- and then -- and then brat --</span></p> <p><span id="s1915">A: No.</span> <span id="s1916">First we came from Russia to Wroclaw to live with his brother, and we didn’t find my -- my uncle alive, so we took another apartment next door, to live separate, and my cousin Luba, his -- Yukel’s daughter --</span></p> <p><span id="s1917">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1918">A: -- was older, she was 18 or something, she was working.</span> <span id="s1919">A beautiful girl.</span> <span id="s1920">And Mordechai, my cousin, was 14, and then they were creating kibbutz’s -- kibbutz for young Jewish people to emigrate to Israel.</span> <span id="s1921">Since he didn’t have a father and mother, at age of 14, when we came we met Mordechai, my cousin, very lovely, he was in a kibbutz already, Shomer Hatzair, they called the kibbutz, and he was on his way to emigrate to Israel.</span> <span id="s1922">The sister, Luba was older, she didn’t want him to go, but he didn’t want to stay in Poland and he emigrated to Israel, is still til today, he lives all his life in a kibbutz.</span> <span id="s1923">He married there, he has a daughter, and he lives now in Golan Heights, Kibbutz Dafna.</span></p> <p><span id="s1924">Q: And did he go before the State of Israel was formed, or after?</span> <span id="s1925">Do you know</span></p> <p><span id="s1926">A: In ’48.</span></p> <p><span id="s1927">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1928">So it may have been after.</span></p> <p><span id="s1929">A: After.</span></p> <p><span id="s1930">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1931">A:

they were heroes.</span> <span id="s1943">They fought for the Eretz -- Eretz Israel, for their country.</span> <span id="s1944">They were very patriotic, young people.</span> <span id="s1945">We settled in -- in Wroclaw.</span> <span id="s1946">I went to a Polish school nearby because I didn’t know to write and to read in Polish, only in Russian.</span></p> <p><span id="s1947">Q: And you had gone t -- up to what grade in --</span></p> <p><span id="s1948">A: Three.</span> <span id="s1949">Third.</span></p> <p><span id="s1950">Q: Three?</span></p> <p><span id="s1951">A: Mm-hm, third

id="s1958">And that was nearby, like second street from our house, and my mom sent us to school because it was close, and that she didn’t have to take us far away because she was working and my father.</span> <span id="s1959">So we live in one room apartment with a kitchen, but there was running water in the house, and electricity.</span></p> <p><span id="s1960">Q: Oh, really, running water -- really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1961">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1962">Q: Ever after the -- even right after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1963">A: Yeah, after the war, it was -- Wroclaw was a very beautiful German city.</span> <span id="s1964">After the war was taking over, and I saw German people being thrown out from the apartments, took whatever they could with them.</span> <span id="s1965">It was a long, long walk.</span> <span id="s1966">And I stood with tears in my eyes, although Germans did a lot of atrocity to us, but they were children and old people, mostly, because young Germans were killed in the front or whatever.</span> <span id="s1967">They were orphans with grandparents, walking and pushing the pushcarts in a long line.</span> <span id="s1968">As a child that went through a lot, I felt very sorry.</span> <span id="s1969">Some Polacks threw rocks at them.</span> <span id="s1970">Farflucta ju -- Deutsche, they called them dirty Deutsch like they called farflucta Juden to us, the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1971">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1972">A: And at school, in the Polish school, I felt terrible.</span> <span id="s1973">First of all the Polacks are all blonde mostly, blue eyes.</span> <span id="s1974">I had dark hair.</span> <span id="s1975">They pulled my hair all the time.</span> <span id="s1976">Oh, look at that Jewess.</span> <span id="s1977">[speaks Polish here].</span> <span id="s1978">You know in Polish [Polish] in a nice way, that Jewess has dark hair.</span> <span id="s1979">Where did you come from?</span> <span id="s1980">You killed our Jesus.</span> <span id="s1981">I didn’t know what Jesus is, what religion, nothing then.</span> <span id="s1982">In Russia there was no religion, nobody talked about anything.</span> <span id="s1983">I came home crying, dirty Jew, dirty Jew [Polish] like in Polish the parshiva like somebody has a disease, you know, uncurable disease.</span> <span id="s1984">I never seen such hatreds during the war with the Russian like I encountered in Poland.</span> <span id="s1985">They were so against everything and everybody, especially Jews.</span> <span id="s1986">Jews killed Jesus, Jews are bad, we have to kill the Jews.</span> <span id="s1987">I said to my mom, I’m not going to that school.</span> <span id="s1988">My mom said, where would you go?</span> <span id="s1989">It’s far away, this is close.</span> <span id="s1990">I said, I’m not going to that school, they call me names and I don’t know even why.</span> <span id="s1991">One day she went there and there was a priest, a young priest and she spoke to that priest.</span> <span id="s1992">He was teaching religion.</span> <span id="s1993">I approached that priest, I said in Polish -- I learned fast, I said [speaks Polish] you -- like your highness, priests, in Polish there’s an expression, “Can I stay on the lesson when you teaching religion?”</span> <span id="s1994">He say, “Why?</span> <span id="s1995">You not Catholic.”</span> <span id="s1996">I says, “What’s the difference?</span> <span id="s1997">I want to know why they call me dirty Jew, can you explain that to me?</span> <span id="s1998">Am I dirty?</span> <span id="s1999">I have dark hair, but I went through the war, and I am surviving, and now I came to free Poland, and I am a dirty Jew.”</span> <span id="s2000">He said, “Well, I’ll give you a book about the New Testament, and if you don’t understand something, you ask.”</span> <span id="s2001">I read that New Testament, about how the world was created, and about Jesus, where he was born and the Holy Mary.</span> <span id="s2002">I see they are Jewish too, you know, they came from Israel, from Nazareth, from the -- Jesus Christ came from the dynasty of David the King.</span> <span id="s2003">King David.</span> <span id="s2004">I started to analyze, I said, “Why am I a dirty Jew?</span> <span id="s2005">You also Jewish.”</span> <span id="s2006">I asked the priest -- I started to -- to be more political.</span> <span id="s2007">You also Jewish, because Jesus Christ and Holy Mary was Jewish.</span> <span id="s2008">And I read the New Testament, but I don’t know the Old Testament.</span> <span id="s2009">I don’t know anything about religion because in my house they told us we are Jewish and that was it.</span> <span id="s2010">We didn’t go to synagogue, my parents didn’t go nowhere.</span> <span id="s2011">There was later, a Jewish synagogue, beautiful, built 800 years ago by German Jews in that city, and Hitler used to come to Wroclaw and had speeches in a big hall, which is still there.</span> <span id="s2012">It’s a beautiful city.</span> <span id="s2013">I started bec -- I became very conscious of ma -- about my past, and who am I. I ask question, Mama -- in Polish then -- who are we?</span> <span id="s2014">We Jewish, you say.</span> <span id="s2015">Why don’t we go to pray?</span> <span id="s2016">Why the Polacks have churches, and they call us dirty Jew, why?</span> <span id="s2017">Always why.</span> <span id="s2018">M-My mom said, “I cannot answer you all this.</span> <span id="s2019">They don’t like us and that’s all, because they claim we killed Jesus Christ.”</span> <span id="s2020">I say, “But that’s not true.</span> <span id="s2021">He was Jewish.”</span> <span id="s2022">And then there were the Romans.</span> <span id="s2023">You know, I know very well the history, and I just pushed them like this.</span> <span id="s2024">Nobody can win with me.</span> <span id="s2025">I said, “I am who I am and you are who you are.”</span> <span id="s2026">You have to be human.</span> <span id="s2027">And I found out that there is opening a Jewish school, but it’s very far away from us, where we live.</span> <span id="s2028">And I said to Mom, “Mama, I’m going to Jewish school.”</span> <span id="s2029">She started [speaks foreign language here] “Where are you running?”</span> <span id="s2030">I said, “I’m going to a Jewish school.”</span> <span id="s2031">And while we going to a Jewish school, they will not call us dirty Jew, and no anti-Semites, and I don’t want to see them.</span> <span id="s2032">And beside, they going to feed us there.</span> <span id="s2033">Food is very important.</span> <span id="s2034">They going to give us lunch at school.</span> <span id="s2035">What I did, like I am a organizer that they call me always, commander, my friends, I’m a very organizer, so I said to my friends at the street, Jewish chi-children, “You know what?</span> <span id="s2036">Let’s go register.”</span> <span id="s2037">That was summertime.</span> <span id="s2038">We go to register to a Jewish school, and it’s very far away, we have to take two tramways, there was electric s --</span></p> <p><span id="s2039">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2040">A: -- streetcars, and then the communication of buses.</span> <span id="s2041">It took like an hour to get each way.</span> <span id="s2042">I got all my friends, my Jewish friends from this street, from the other street, we went in the summer, we registered.</span> <span id="s2043">And now is a problem.</span> <span id="s2044">The school starts.</span> <span id="s2045">All of the children speak Russian, they came from Russia, different ages, nobody knows to write or read Polish or Russian, and we s -- all speak rush -- Polish or Yiddish, and we speak Russian.</span> <span id="s2046">It’s like [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2047">So, the teachers were some of them older, some of them -- and they had a dilemma with different ages, how to place the children in classes, according to their brain and intelligence, everything.</span> <span id="s2048">They put older children, like 10 - 11, because we’re -- I was in the first grade.</span> <span id="s2049">I was a big girl, and they were little kids.</span> <span id="s2050">I was embarrassed.</span> <span id="s2051">I was taller than them.</span> <span id="s2052">I said, “I’m not going to that class.”</span> <span id="s2053">So what they did, very good thing, they gather all the older children that they don’t belong to the first grade, 10 - 11 - 12 even, and we got into one class, it was intensive study, because we had background in Russian, we already knew how to read.</span></p> <p><span id="s2054">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2055">A: To study Yiddish and Polish.</span> <span id="s2056">And it to -- they call it a chong.</span> <span id="s2057">Chong means to pull, you know, pull everybody out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2058">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2059">A: And they call it the chong, and we studied for a year, very intensely.</span> <span id="s2060">I knew mathematic better than everybody because I was there in third grade, in Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s2061">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2062">A: And I knew how to multiply and this, they didn't know how to put one and one together.</span> <span id="s2063">So, I was good, and then we studied Polish and Yiddish to write alphabet and everything for a whole year.</span> <span id="s2064">And then, according to ages, they placed us in different classes.</span> <span id="s2065">I went to the fourth grade, so I didn’t lose too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s2066">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2067">A: So I studied history, Jewish history, I still have -- it was then in Polish history [Polish] I have that book, the history of Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s2068">Q: Of Jews, yeah.</span></p> <p><span

id="s2073">First of all, they gave us lunch in the Jewish school.</span> <span id="s2074">We studied Russian, Polish, Yiddish, history, geography, whatever other gr -- in the same grade.</span> <span id="s2075">Mathematics, and I knew mathematics good because from Russia.</span> <span id="s2076">And we were very happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2077">Q: Did you sign up Mordechai as well?</span></p>

<p><span id="s2086">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2087">A: He was not.</span></p> <p><span id="s2088">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2089">But that was okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2090">A: But he

Two tramways we took, and you know, switched?</span> <span id="s2098">It took like an hour and a half to get each way, but we didn’t mind.</span> <span id="s2099">We walked home, back, if we wanted to save money to see a movie.</span></p> <p><span id="s2100">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2101">A: Mama couldn’t give us money to go see a movie.</span> <span id="s2102">It was not that expensive, but for them it was, so we always sneaked in without money.</span></p> <p><span id="s2103">Q: But you also told me off camera that you snuck into all sorts of things.</span></p> <p><span id="s2104">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2105">Q: Opera --</span></p> <p><span id="s2106">A: Opera.</span></p> <p><span id="s2107">Q: -- concerts --</span></p> <p><span id="s2108">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span

id="s2264">At the beginning I didn’t like him when he used to come to us because I was more cultured girl from a big city --</span></p> <p><span id="s2265">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2266">A: -- going to theaters, behaving nice, talking quiet.</span> <span id="s2267">He came from this small town and [indecipherable] yelling, screaming, gesticulating with the hands, and this, running.</span> <span id="s2268">And I was embarrassed to go out with him.</span> <span id="s2269">Then -- he used to come, not too often in the summer, to stay with us with his father because his father and mother and my parents were the best friend in Warsaw, Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s2270">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2271">A: We kind of grew up together, but I did not

<span id="s2274">And of course we didn’t do anything, we were very naïve children in those days.</span> <span id="s2275">But he called me my sweetheart, and my sunshine, and I was embarrassed to hear that, you know?</span> <span id="s2276">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s2277">Q: That was too open for you, or something?</span></p> <p><span id="s2278">A: Too open --</span></p> <p><span id="s2279">Q:
