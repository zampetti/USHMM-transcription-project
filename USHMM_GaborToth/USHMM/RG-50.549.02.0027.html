Before we go on and talk about -- even though this is a post Holocaust interview, just say for the record that we’re going to talk about some pre-war and wartime things that weren’t covered in the first interview.</span> <span id="s15">And one of the things that I wanted to know from you has to do with just your very early years, your -- I wanted the names of your family and something about the relationships within the family.</span> <span id="s16">I know you -- you mentioned in the first interview you had two brothers and two sisters.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Answer: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: And their names and their ages relative to you and -- and then also your parents names, and you didn’t say anything about your -- your mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: Well, our family consists of father and mother and two sisters and two brothers and myself, of course.</span> <span id="s20">My father’s name, Hebrew name was Eliakim.</span> <span id="s21">In Polish, he was Yakob, which is Jacob, but it’s no -- no connection to the Hebrew name.</span> <span id="s22">My mother’s name was Rosa -- Raisil in Yiddish, but the Polish name was Rosa.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: And her maiden name?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: Her maiden name was Kirzner.</span> <span id="s25">And my brother next to me was Chaim and was born in 1917, then we have a sa -- I have the sister, Miriam, who was born 1920.</span> <span id="s26">And next came my brother Reuben, who survived the war, still lives in Boston now.</span> <span id="s27">And he was born 1922.</span> <span id="s28">And had a little sister who was born in 1927.</span> <span id="s29">She -- I was 12 years old when she was born.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: And her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: And her name was Hannah.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: Were you -- and -- were you particularly close with any of your brothers or sisters?</span> <span id="s33">A: We were very close, we were very close, but my problem was that I did not live at -- with all of them all the time, because since I lived in a small village and my father wanted me to get some kind of education, which started about three years old.</span> <span id="s34">I was shipped off to the next town, which was about 12 mile -- 12 kilometers from our town, where there was a teacher.</span> <span id="s35">As a matter of fact, my father worked there one year as a teacher, after he lost his job, which I talked about in the -- on the videotape.</span> <span id="s36">And I used to be away from them for awhile.</span> <span id="s37">And later on, I was sent to a high school in Koven, which is the big city not far from where we lived.</span> <span id="s38">And again, I -- I missed my family.</span> <span id="s39">I was there only one year.</span> <span id="s40">This was my formal education.</span> <span id="s41">And then when I was 16, I left town also, to go in search of a -- learning a professional job in the city of Lodz.</span> <span id="s42">And sin -- fr-from then on, I was away for quite a few years, returned about a year or two before the war came.</span> <span id="s43">Then a year before the war, I came -- I -- I got married.</span> <span id="s44">A son was born.</span> <span id="s45">His -- My wife’s name was Rifka.</span> <span id="s46">This was in 1938.</span> <span id="s47">I omitted it from my videotape.</span> <span id="s48">And my son’s name was Benjamin -- Benjamin.</span> <span id="s49">He -- He -- He lived only three years.</span> <span id="s50">He was born in ni -- you know, we were married in 1938, he was born in 1939 and in 1942, in September, a week before Rosh Hashanah, the 23 days in the month of Ell, Hebrew month, they were all taken out and shot, including my little boy.</span> <span id="s51">That’s [indecipherable] was my family.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: Where was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: This was in that -- in a village called Povorsk, which we visited two years ago.</span> <span id="s54">I think my wife told you about a visit to -- the trip there.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: She talked about the trip to Vilno, but didn’t talk about your trip to Povorsk.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: Yeah, well, it started with Povorsk.</span> <span id="s57">A -- I -- I was not there when the tragedy happened.</span> <span id="s58">I was in the Soviet Union, working a coal mine.</span> <span id="s59">And I found out about -- I knew -- I -- I -- the Soviet -- I -- I read the Soviet press, even though I worked for a slave labor camp, we had a cultural life.</span> <span id="s60">There were -- there was a library with papers and books which you could read.</span> <span id="s61">As a matter of fact, I ha -- even had the privilege of subscribing for -- to -- to the Pravda, one of the Soviet papers, for a short while, for a few months, because the librarian, who was also a internee like myself, had about half a dozen papers he could give, to give us a semblance of kind of freedom and culture.</span> <span id="s62">So, he gave me the privilege of sur-surpri -- which was dirt cheap, it was pennies.</span> <span id="s63">But, to me it had a big value besides reading it, I could read it in the library.</span> <span id="s64">But I could sell it afterward for the purpose of rolling cigarettes.</span> <span id="s65">I, myself, was smoking.</span> <span id="s66">And we used to have a kind of -- there was some commerce in the camp.</span> <span id="s67">Womens used to come out from outside and had a little -- put like a -- a kiosk in the camp.</span> <span id="s68">And if you had money, you could buy things.</span> <span id="s69">They used to bring in milk, he used to bring in tobacco, which was sold by the glass.</span> <span id="s70">Actually, that was not even tobacco, it was tobacco roots, which were chopped up with an ax and you rolled it in newspaper.</span> <span id="s71">Now, once a mon -- once a week, I used to sell my bread ration in this commerce in -- intercamp commerce -- intracamp commerce, and buy tobacco.</span> <span id="s72">But I had to buy a newspaper.</span> <span id="s73">A newspaper cost 10 rubles.</span> <span id="s74">So, when I had five newspapers or six newspapers a week, I could sell five of them and one use for my own needs and with others I used to get the 50 rubles and use it to buy the tobacco roots, see?</span> <span id="s75">So, while I had it, I was in very good shape, financially.</span> <span id="s76">I didn’t have to sell my bread ration.</span> <span id="s77">So -- and in the press, there wasn’t much about the Final Solution.</span> <span id="s78">The Soviet press didn’t write much about it, they wrote about atrocities committed against the Soviet people, none that mentioned Jews.</span> <span id="s79">Of course the particular Jews [indecipherable] designed to be exterminated.</span> <span id="s80">But -- And they knew about it, of course, but they didn’t -- I remember when the revolt broke out in the Warsaw ghetto, there was a little column, one column, but about four or five inches tall, about a revolt in the Warsaw ghetto, which was liquidated by -- the Warsaw ghetto was liquidated by the German -- the German occupiers.</span> <span id="s81">Not mentioning much about just one word to the Jews.</span> <span id="s82">The ghetto, of course, they had to mention the ghetto, because there’s only one kind of a ghetto, a Jewish ghetto.</span> <span id="s83">So they mentioned it.</span> <span id="s84">So there wasn’t much about it.</span> <span id="s85">But one day, when the forces -- the Soviet forces approached not far from where my town was located, I wrote a letter from camp to the -- somebody in the ci -- town council, asking if there’s any information about my family.</span> <span id="s86">It so happened that the town was not liberated yet.</span> <span id="s87">It was still -- there was still the -- the -- the front was there in the -- the next city.</span> <span id="s88">For quite awhile, places changed hands back and forth, but I -- another town close to it, was already liberated.</span> <span id="s89">And a friend of mine, who was a former partisan, where my brother was also a partisan of the sa -- the same place, the same time.</span> <span id="s90">He was already liberated and he was working in the post office.</span> <span id="s91">And when they saw my name -- my return address, with my name on it, he opened the letter and he sent it to my brother.</span> <span id="s92">He read it, sent to my brother and my brother answered it.</span> <span id="s93">And he -- he just wrote me that he is -- he knows that he -- he is -- he is alive, everything is -- all is well.</span> <span id="s94">He works now as -- doing -- as a guard in an NKVD, secret -- secret police farm.</span> <span id="s95">And he sent me -- he would sent me some money.</span> <span id="s96">Course, they used to speculate theirselves by [indecipherable] and he knew that I was in bad shape, so he send me some money.</span> <span id="s97">A few days later, I got a letter from one of my friend -- a former brother-in-law of mine, as a matter of fact, and then his brother, describing what happened and how it happened and who survived and did not survive.</span> <span id="s98">So I knew -- then I find out what happened.</span> <span id="s99">And I had in mind that my wi -- in 1945, after the war, the Poles and the Soviets conclude an agreement to let -- this ha -- by the way, this information is in the videotape, but I’m telling you so you understand what I am talking about -- had an agreement to let all of those who were former Polish citizens, til ‘39, coo -- provided they are Jews or Poles, not Ukrainians or Russians, could get out, back to Poland.</span> <span id="s100">And after a year, they find -- this is a long story, but doesn’t make any sense, it repeats again.</span> <span id="s101">I left the Soviet Union, you know, and then came to Poland.</span> <span id="s102">But, I ha -- I thought I’ll be able to go by this town and see what -- you know, where the place was, at least, fo-found out what happened.</span> <span id="s103">But luckily, luckily, I could not stop there, because th-they routed me through a different way, through Belarus, through Minsk and -- but I always dreamed about coming back to Povorsk and putting up a monument, which was impossible during Soviet days.</span> <span id="s104">First of all, they didn’t allow any monuments which specifically said Jews perished there.</span> <span id="s105">Soviet citizens, yes, but not Jews.</span> <span id="s106">So, i-in -- in -- and at that time, this -- this was a very dangerous place to be, because Ukrainian nationalists already harassed the Soviet army and killed the Jews, just like the Poles did after the war, yeah.</span> <span id="s107">So, is good that they did not go through.</span> <span id="s108">But I -- I -- It was a kind of -- became an obsession for me to come and put up a monument.</span> <span id="s109">Now, when you co -- then they st -- they started allowing already do -- before Gorbachov’s time already, they start allowing put up with and even in Yiddish or in Hebrew, what happened -- descriptions on these monuments, and they allowed to have Jews.</span> <span id="s110">I don’t know if you know about that pol -- a Soviet write up of the name of Viefter Schenko, who wrote a poem about, “There’s no monument in Babier,” which is Kiev -- probably heard about it.</span> <span id="s111">And he wrote he’s ashamed being a Russian, that they did not allow to put up m-monuments in these places, so they did allow, finally they did allow.</span> <span id="s112">And then, in the beg -- middle of this decade, since ‘95, I think, Ukraine became independent and they allowed, already.</span> <span id="s113">And there was a fellow in our -- in -- in the -- in the province there, who, as a matter of fact, he’s -- he -- he was the -- the -- the secretary of the Communist party in the -- in the -- yeah, he was half Jewish, too, but he didn’t -- he said himself Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s114">And he started putting up this monument with government help, first Soviet and then the independent Ukraine.</span> <span id="s115">I got in touch with him, I found out there is in Israel a organization, it’s called the House of Waleen.</span> <span id="s116">Waleen is the name of the province which has records of many.</span> <span id="s117">There’s probably, in that part, hundreds of thousands of Jews perished.</span> <span id="s118">They didn’t send them to -- to concentration camps, they killed them right then and there.</span> <span id="s119">In our town, it was exploded dump, oil dump that the Soviets built and they exploded it and then they used it for when they killed th-the German [indecipherable] they dump the Jews in there, you know.</span> <span id="s120">And this is the place -- so it was a military zone, belonged to the army.</span> <span id="s121">And you could not go into any place in army during Soviet days.</span> <span id="s122">They agreed they’ll let us put up the monument.</span> <span id="s123">We -- We -- We a-agreed on a price with -- how much it’ll cost.</span> <span id="s124">But it came the day when they’re supposed -- already the monument is ready and they decided nyet, they’re not allowed to on the mili-military.</span> <span id="s125">So, I -- finally it was ready, we are ready to go in 19 -- in 19 -- this was what, 60, now is 90 -- 98 and 96.</span> <span id="s126">95, we had a date and I had a group, the -- a woman from the local -- well, W -- WMG -- GME, I think it is.</span> <span id="s127">That used to be WGAM.</span> <span id="s128">This is affiliate of CBS.</span> <span id="s129">No, wait a minute, was NBC.</span> <span id="s130">NBC, ABC, what’s it, the other one?</span> <span id="s131">Q: CBS.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: CBS, yeah, CBS, with a cameraman and a reporter.</span> <span id="s133">Reluctantly the station agreed to pay her expenses, she wanted to go very badly, but you couldn’t go, because they said they wouldn’t allow to -- later on I found out they did allow it, make a long story short, and we -- we scheduled a trip for the next year, 1960 -- 96, yeah.</span> <span id="s134">I had a group of about 12 people.</span> <span id="s135">There was myself, my wife and my daughter from Louisiana.</span> <span id="s136">The one from Israel couldn’t make it, she couldn’t get vacation at that time, which I hope by next year to take her and some of my grandchildren, [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s137">And we f -- and two women, one -- both of them lived in New York, one now is in Boston and the other one works in New York, daughters of survivors.</span> <span id="s138">And then there was another son of survivors, whose father was a partisan with my brother.</span> <span id="s139">My brother and his wife and his three children, made a group of 12 people.</span> <span id="s140">And a friend of mine who lives in Warsaw came with us and Rochelle, of course.</span> <span id="s141">And we came -- we visited Warsaw.</span> <span id="s142">We went to Povorsk, this town.</span> <span id="s143">We -- I have some pictures, I’ll show you, of this.</span> <span id="s144">I also have a tape from that time, to all -- put this all in.</span> <span id="s145">We were met by the officials of the local government -- the head of the local council and by the officials, the hea -- the head of the -- deputy chairman of the regional council, which probably that’s about 20 to 30 village -- like a county, approximately, here.</span> <span id="s146">Went with us with -- they -- we rented a bus and we stayed at a hotel, without cold water.</span> <span id="s147">My wife probably told you about the toilets [indecipherable] tell you.</span> <span id="s148">And we stayed there two days.</span> <span id="s149">We visited this town, we put up the monument.</span> <span id="s150">We made -- you know, dedicated -- dedicated the monu -- the monument was standing already.</span> <span id="s151">It was -- had the description of Hebrew, Ukrainian and -- and English, not in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s152">And we started talking among ourselves, my friend from Poland, this -- remarked it should be in Yiddish also, even though nobody can understand, nobody can read it, we are here, you know, the few of us old ones to understand, will be gone soon.</span> <span id="s153">So we commissioned him, developer there, to put -- and we gave a few hundred more dollars, to put up the -- I had my -- the inscription in Yiddish, I had prepared all the -- all of them, all the descriptions.</span> <span id="s154">So I gave him a copy of it and he sent me a photo that it’s already there, it’s put on.</span> <span id="s155">They also decided to -- we decided it needs a wider, more -- under the -- what do you call it?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: Base?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: The base, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: Pedestal?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: No, well you put under the house, what’s under the house?</span> <span id="s160">Q: Foundation?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: Foundation.</span> <span id="s162">A wider foundation because it might topple.</span> <span id="s163">It looks good.</span> <span id="s164">It was a beautiful [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s165">So, we visited there one day and the same day we went to -- to more neighboring towns.</span> <span id="s166">One, the town where I was born, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: Which was?</span> <span id="s168">What was the name?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: Which was called Threeanoffka, Threeanoffka.</span> <span id="s170">And the -- there is a monument they put up themselves, place it is sa -- they say 345 Jews were buried there.</span> <span id="s171">I don’t know who counted them, but that’s what they did.</span> <span id="s172">It’s in Hebrew and in Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s173">But in this town, there is a Jewish cemetery, par-part of which survived, ironically, a -- a cemetery that survives here, because the -- most cemeteries didn’t.</span> <span id="s174">But, after the day, I was so -- we as -- we have to go to another town, we had relatives there and the -- one of the participants, [indecipherable] his parents lived there.</span> <span id="s175">So, there was already late and he talked me in, th-the fellow that put up the [indecipherable] talked me into go.</span> <span id="s176">Not -- It was only a few minutes away, I realized afterward.</span> <span id="s177">So, hopefully I’ll go there again next year.</span> <span id="s178">And there, I know, there’s a -- there’s some stones still standing, one -- including I know one from my grandmother, my paternal grandmother is buried there.</span> <span id="s179">And all -- all my relatives are buried there that died naturally, you know, the -- over generations.</span> <span id="s180">I don’t know how much of it is left though, but I can’t wait to see it.</span> <span id="s181">And we went to another town, where there about -- over 3,000 people buried.</span> <span id="s182">And we came back to the big city, city where I went to high school, we came to the hotel and we lied down there fo -- to have a nap, to have supper late -- oh, yeah, th -- I didn’t tell you about this story.</span> <span id="s183">They invited us to dinner.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: Who did?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: The -- The officials invite us to dinner and there might have been about 20 people there.</span> <span id="s186">The commandant of the base and his little girl and a few other people, th-the driver, the photographer.</span> <span id="s187">We had -- We had the video photographer, yeah.</span> <span id="s188">Whom -- For whom, you know, we paid, but it -- pennies, you know, si -- their -- their currency was so -- it was 280,000 rubles.</span> <span id="s189">Ukrainian rubles, not Russian rubles, because [indecipherable] at that time, forpa dollars, stack like this.</span> <span id="s190">And -- And the vodka flow -- flowed like water, you know, and we had borsht and we had pilmani, which is Jewish, kreplach, you know.</span> <span id="s191">Familiar dishes.</span> <span id="s192">And -- And pork.</span> <span id="s193">This was [indecipherable] bread, great br-bread was good.</span> <span id="s194">And steak, it was kind of a cook steak and a -- it was good, was a good meal.</span> <span id="s195">And they made speeches and of course, whoever spoke.</span> <span id="s196">I spoke, during the dedication of the monument.</span> <span id="s197">I’ll show you, if you have -- if you’ll have time, I’ll show you part of it.</span> <span id="s198">You might get the -- the feeling what -- how it was there.</span> <span id="s199">And we said some prayers, and the Kaddish.</span> <span id="s200">So, when we came back to the hotel -- the hotel was a beautiful building with -- nice and clean, nice bed, but there’s no cold wa -- no hot water, cold water, so you couldn’t take a shower.</span> <span id="s201">So we lied down, we think it’ll be later on -- this was already what, six, seven o’clock, have to have a nap, because it’s so em-emotionally charged you know, and then -- and then the -- physically tired and exhausted.</span> <span id="s202">So we lied down for -- figure for about an hour and figure then we’ll go out and have dinner or supper, whatever [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s203">We woke up eight o’clock in the morning, without -- and dress [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s204">That’s how we -- tired we were.</span> <span id="s205">So then we went to Warsaw and from Warsaw, we split, my brother and his family -- and his family went to Lodz, where my sister-in-law was born, with their kids.</span> <span id="s206">His name was Reuben, her name was -- is Bella and the three kids was Ruth and Allen and -- and Audrey.</span> <span id="s207">And the two girls went to France, to have a good time, to Paris.</span> <span id="s208">And we went to Vilna with Rochelle, she told you about this trip, very, very emotional.</span> <span id="s209">So that’s how we -- then we came back to Warsaw, because there’s no direct flights from Vilna, or -- so they had to go through Warsaw and my -- my friend, who was -- who prepared dinner for us, it happened to be our anniversary.</span> <span id="s210">This was June 22nd.</span> <span id="s211">We went on the 17th, th-this was June 22nd, which is -- turned to -- our wedding anniversary, it’s also the anniversary of the beginning of the war between Germany and Russia -- Soviet Union, 19 -- 1942.</span> <span id="s212">And from Vilna, we came back to Warsaw, stayed a couple of days.</span> <span id="s213">Warsaw, of course, is a beautiful city.</span> <span id="s214">I knew Warsaw from before the war.</span> <span id="s215">It looks exactly the way it did look and -- and sa -- improved.</span> <span id="s216">They have nice set of -- of cross the busy sections, you had underground shopping centers like, underground.</span> <span id="s217">And if you cross, you know Mashallkosco is the main street, you go under -- you cannot cross the street.</span> <span id="s218">And the -- the -- the traffic is unbelievable, it looked beautiful.</span> <span id="s219">And the situation, my sister-in-law told me Lodz was not as good.</span> <span id="s220">Warsaw’s fine, but the -- the countryside is not -- not good.</span> <span id="s221">Economic situation not good.</span> <span id="s222">But through, of course we were interest -- we went -- I went to look at the ghetto and I had an uncle and an aunt and cousins living there.</span> <span id="s223">And there’s nothing.</span> <span id="s224">Empty, but signs -- signs of streets that don’t exist and signs of bunkers where the -- the Warsaw ghetto fighters came out or went into the sewers.</span> <span id="s225">Lamila, aiteen and some other places.</span> <span id="s226">Of course, it’s -- it affected us very badly.</span> <span id="s227">The rest of the city is beautiful, except the ghetto, nothing there.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: Who was it in your family who was killed in Povorsk?</span> <span id="s229">Per -- From your wife and son and your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: My -- My parents, my two sisters and then one brother was killed in the partisan group.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: Which brother was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: This was Chaim, the second oldest, after me.</span> <span id="s233">H-He was, you know, there was a group that came out -- I’m repeating the same thing you have already, on the videotapes, a group of Jewish boys and girls came out just days before, they’re prepared already, weeks before, to leave the town, because Poles didn’t have a ghetto.</span> <span id="s234">There were -- There used -- The -- The -- There was one -- one German in town, Usunderfuerer.</span> <span id="s235">He was a good man, helped a lot of Jews.</span> <span id="s236">But the -- his official thing was to -- to collect whatever he could, you know, the furs, gold, anything of -- of value from the Jews.</span> <span id="s237">And then he had the Jews working in this exploded oil dump, to squeeze out the oil that seeped through into the sand.</span> <span id="s238">Cause this is pra -- what was high -- high octane fuel -- aviation fuel, yeah, when the Soviets exploded it.</span> <span id="s239">An-And they had to turn it in, but at the same time, they used to steal some of it, in bottles, in su -- having the coat and put it under the coat.</span> <span id="s240">And they -- For a year, they lived from that.</span> <span id="s241">They used to exchange it with the peasants, which used it for -- for lightning fuel, you know, for kerosene.</span> <span id="s242">They found a way, because this was very dangerous, they have to put some salt in it.</span> <span id="s243">And salt was very, very expensive.</span> <span id="s244">Salt is -- was a -- you know, ver -- at a higher value than gold, salt.</span> <span id="s245">Th-Their -- Their diets require a lot of sa -- well, everybody, Europeans need a lot of salt.</span> <span id="s246">So for the preserving pork you had to need sa -- you need salt.</span> <span id="s247">And to -- for cooking, for anything, you need salt.</span> <span id="s248">So salt was very expen -- but still, they put in some salt and they could use kerosene lamps.</span> <span id="s249">There was no electricity in that region.</span> <span id="s250">So that’s what they did.</span> <span id="s251">So, for a year, they were not molested.</span> <span id="s252">Well, they were, but not to -- to such an extent as in other cities.</span> <span id="s253">The Ukrainian police was the worst, of course.</span> <span id="s254">There was no Germans in town, they were at the front.</span> <span id="s255">Only this one German.</span> <span id="s256">A friend of mine was his orderly.</span> <span id="s257">Used to do the -- in the day when they killed the Jews, he -- he t-told them, “Take this horse out to the field, this horse.”</span> <span id="s258">In -- In other words, he gave him opportunity to run away and he did survive this way.</span> <span id="s259">So -- And the rest of the towns, and my wife’s parents -- the brothers escaped -- three brothers escaped, one -- and the fourth one is -- oh -- there -- she had four brothers and three of them escaped.</span> <span id="s260">One of them escaped with the -- he worked for the Soviet railroad.</span> <span id="s261">Later on, he was accused that he let the one train run with the other -- Soviet -- the Soviet law is very strict and they put him in jail and he died in jail.</span> <span id="s262">You know that.</span> <span id="s263">And many friends -- we didn’t have any more relatives in this town, my relatives lived in the next town, which I told you about, Rhiannoffka.</span> <span id="s264">And everywhere there was my relatives there.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: Can you describe what it was like to be back in Povorsk after all those years, emotionally.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: It’s -- It’s -- It’s very difficult to describe it, but I’ll try.</span> <span id="s267">We were -- I didn’t recognize th-the -- the village.</span> <span id="s268">This changed entirely, the roads are different.</span> <span id="s269">They are paved roads, they weren’t in those days.</span> <span id="s270">And we came -- we lived near the railroad station, about a hundred meter or a hundred yards from the railroad, right across.</span> <span id="s271">And there was a water tower.</span> <span id="s272">Railroad -- Belonged to the railroads, was for the purpose of filling the locomotives with water.</span> <span id="s273">It was, in that time, all locomotives were all coal -- coal and steam.</span> <span id="s274">So it needs lots of water.</span> <span id="s275">There was a pipeline from -- from the -- from a lake, about three kilometers away, about two miles approximately, to this water tower.</span> <span id="s276">And from u -- the water towers was between the railroad and us, which is as close as from here to Wayside Road.</span> <span id="s277">And there’s nothing there.</span> <span id="s278">Our houses were -- a matter of fact, they have a picture of our house.</span> <span id="s279">It’s -- Somebody found it and I don’t know where they got it, sent it to -- to a friend of mine in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: Tape one, side B, of an interview with Jerry Slivka.</span> <span id="s282">So y-you just repeat about -- about your house?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: Yeah, well, half of the house is on this picture.</span> <span id="s284">And then the three neighbor’s houses -- four neighbor’s houses, five -- five or six neighbor’s house in same row.</span> <span id="s285">And then there was a flour mill, which is -- this -- it’s not there.</span> <span id="s286">Nothing there now.</span> <span id="s287">Behind that, about 20 yards away, there’s a whole new section built of new homes.</span> <span id="s288">And I have the suspicion they were built from the materials of these houses.</span> <span id="s289">They didn’t want to live in these houses, you know, in case somebody claims them or what.</span> <span id="s290">E-Even though they thought everybody died anyway.</span> <span id="s291">But, it would better, you know, to pull them apart and build new houses.</span> <span id="s292">So, I have -- I will show you that picture.</span> <span id="s293">In the front there, in this picture, the front of the houses, there’s military vehicles.</span> <span id="s294">I don’t know was tanks or half tracks or something like that.</span> <span id="s295">And I don’t -- maybe they are Polish or they are Soviet.</span> <span id="s296">It looked like it’s a wide -- wide picture.</span> <span id="s297">It looked like sake -- taken by -- either by the military or by some other coun -- I don’t know, it’s -- it’s not the amateur or a regular photographer picture.</span> <span id="s298">It looked like the scroll, it was rolled up into a storn, what it is fixed and I cou -- I recognized the houses.</span> <span id="s299">And we were standing there and nothing there.</span> <span id="s300">Th-The -- The whole -- The whole -- The whole trip was very emotional.</span> <span id="s301">We got on a train in Warsaw and I knew I -- many times I was traveling this, from Warsaw to -- from -- not so from Warsaw, ulefell from Lodz, travel mi -- and I knew every station, I knew every town.</span> <span id="s302">And every one of them had Jewish people there.</span> <span id="s303">They -- Probably 70 - 80 - 90 percent, some of them were Jewish, the -- the peasants lived in the villages.</span> <span id="s304">Jews lived in the small towns, so called shtetla, see, and some bigger cities.</span> <span id="s305">In the city, you were -- Koven, where I went to school, which is not far from Povorsk, had a population of about 30,000 - 22 to 25,000 were Jewish.</span> <span id="s306">And this -- Now, it’s a cit-city of 60,000, and there isn’t a single Jew.</span> <span id="s307">And the city was completely destroyed in the war and rebuilt by the Soviets, you know, in these drab, long multi-story buildings, which fall a -- which started to fall apart the minute they were built, and they’ re still -- so it wa -- this was very emotional.</span> <span id="s308">In time, you come to the station, I knew that station.</span> <span id="s309">The station was rebuilt exactly the way it was before the war.</span> <span id="s310">Looks -- This was a beautiful station and it still looks beautiful, til you come into it.</span> <span id="s311">You see there -- Rochelle had to go to the bathroom in the hole in the floor, she -- with a half partition in between the men and the women.</span> <span id="s312">Luckily, our daughter went in with her, so she could help her to get up.</span> <span id="s313">She has problem with her back.</span> <span id="s314">Otherwise, I know what would happen there.</span> <span id="s315">And there -- the -- the -- there’s the bazaar, you can buy anything you want, there’s no -- nothing in the store, there is no stores.</span> <span id="s316">One or two stores in the whole city.</span> <span id="s317">Used to be a lively, you know, commercial center, nothing.</span> <span id="s318">I don’t know, there might be a few Jews.</span> <span id="s319">Somebody said there might be two or three Jews in town, but I -- I never -- the -- nobody came.</span> <span id="s320">None of the population came to this dedication, except the officials.</span> <span id="s321">And they make speeches about, you know, their former citizens and former, you know, survivors of the -- the -- and talking about peace and love among the nations and so forth and so on.</span> <span id="s322">I thanked them for putting up the monument, I thanked them for -- I -- I carried with me a oak seedling, grown from an acorn in my backyard, right here.</span> <span id="s323">And when I opened it up, they couldn’t -- I -- I wrapped it in soil, you know, potting -- like potting soil, that’s wh -- potting soil, what they use, you know, for growing flowers, and they couldn’t -- admired th-the -- the beauty of the soil, you know, such -- looks like rich, fertile soil, because they have sandy soil.</span> <span id="s324">Even the Ukraine has beautiful soil.</span> <span id="s325">And I planted it there and it is not growing so good, because I got a picture from it -- a friend of -- somebody, a friend of mine in Israel, knows a -- non-Jewish, who used to be a neighbor of ours, and they took a picture.</span> <span id="s326">And my brother sends them a check every so often and this fellow there sent them packages.</span> <span id="s327">So they take care of it.</span> <span id="s328">The head of the local council promised that he’ll assign a high school class to take care of it.</span> <span id="s329">So, every year I send them a hundred dollars, which is there a fortune.</span> <span id="s330">And he wouldn’t answer me, so I -- last year I cal -- finally got his telephone number.</span> <span id="s331">I couldn’t reach him at his pla -- place o -- office.</span> <span id="s332">So I got from somebody else in his home, I call him, oh, he was very happy that -- but he didn’t write [indecipherable] he -- maybe he doesn’t know how to write, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s333">But he said oh, they are taking care of it.</span> <span id="s334">I don’t see what they do there, but I can see there’s a -- kind of to protect it, like a little cage.</span> <span id="s335">But it didn’t grow.</span> <span id="s336">The soil is not so good, least probably some fertilizer.</span> <span id="s337">We’ll be there next year, be -- I hope.</span> <span id="s338">I hope, but with me, it was -- I -- th -- th -- this is my -- if I ever accomplished anything in my life, this would be at the -- at the top of it.</span> <span id="s339">Most important thing I did.</span> <span id="s340">I feel I did something my -- they will approve -- would have approved -- th-th-the victims.</span> <span id="s341">So, there are some others aware of that and want to hear about it.</span> <span id="s342">Some contributed to it.</span> <span id="s343">I didn’t want -- it was not decide -- of course, I would pay for it with myself, see?</span> <span id="s344">But I wanted them to participate and to have a stake in it, see?</span> <span id="s345">And whoever I asked, they contributed some.</span> <span id="s346">I didn’t ask, I wrote them a letter them, if you can and want, contribute.</span> <span id="s347">If not, we’ll do it anyway, see?</span> <span id="s348">So, sa -- he ask him, of course, to come visit.</span> <span id="s349">Most of them did not want to.</span> <span id="s350">Most of -- there’s not too many, there’s only a handful.</span> <span id="s351">So this was our trip.</span> <span id="s352">She told you about her -- she stood in the middle of the -- middle of the street and cried.</span> <span id="s353">Vilna -- I don’t know if she told you, Vilna was the culture capital -- the -- the cul -- the Jewish -- Jewish culture.</span> <span id="s354">This was the only place where there was teacher seminars for Hebrew teachers, Yiddish teachers and Polish Yiddish teachers for Vilna -- for high schools.</span> <span id="s355">It had a beautiful library called a streshun library.</span> <span id="s356">And it had a very active, dynamic, Jewish population from -- from the extreme left to the extreme right and the Hasidim -- there were no Hasidim, no, cause Vil-Vilna is just the opposite.</span> <span id="s357">Op -- They opposed Hasidism, see?</span> <span id="s358">So, there was a -- the gowan of Vilna is -- was a rabbi from the 18th century, 18th or 19th.</span> <span id="s359">Yeah, they -- they s-still two streets, they are -- streets of the gowan’s name.</span> <span id="s360">Gowan means a genius in Hebrew, yeah.</span> <span id="s361">And there’s the Jewish street.</span> <span id="s362">Street of the Jews.</span> <span id="s363">Still named so, but there’s no gowan, and no -- the cemetery where her mother was buried is not there, there’s a park there now.</span> <span id="s364">But they’re building in this place at -- some -- some broken monuments and they’re trying to build a little monument composed of all these -- that -- the pieces that they found.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: Will you tell a little bit more about the years before you had gone back and actually erected this monument?</span> <span id="s366">Had you been -- Had it been a dream of yours for a long time to do this?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: It has been -- no-not a -- it was an obsession.</span> <span id="s368">I -- I was waiting for the day that it could be -- I had a feeling one days we’ll do it.</span> <span id="s369">I had a feeling.</span> <span id="s370">It is it -- I never expected that the Soviet Union will collapse this way.</span> <span id="s371">I knew them, I -- they kept everything so strong and it would be -- never believed it, but it did happen.</span> <span id="s372">And I saw that time that I ca -- I can realize my -- my -- my dream.</span> <span id="s373">I wanted very badly to do that, you see.</span> <span id="s374">I -- I -- I could hear -- you know, to this day, when I’m on my lawn, I hear their cries.</span> <span id="s375">Th-The noise of the -- of the lawnmower -- I -- I -- I -- when I was sitting in the mine -- when I found out what happened, I hear their cries.</span> <span id="s376">And I -- I -- At that time, I couldn’t even cry myself.</span> <span id="s377">Now, I can, very easily.</span> <span id="s378">But at that time, I couldn’t and I wonder what happened to me, wh-wh-where is my human emotions?</span> <span id="s379">There were none.</span> <span id="s380">I -- There was nobody to talk to about it.</span> <span id="s381">It is very difficult to describe the feeling, very difficult.</span> <span id="s382">But I hoped to do it.</span> <span id="s383">And we did.</span> <span id="s384">I hope to be again -- I want all my grandchildren to see it, to remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: Did your ability to talk about your first wife and child have anything to do with the erection of the monument?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: No.</span> <span id="s387">No, no, no.</span> <span id="s388">I -- I felt to everybody the [indecipherable] you know, it was my family, my friend, my grandmother.</span> <span id="s389">My grandmother, in the next town, escaped when they started shooting the -- tha -- surrounding the town, th-the Ukrainian police.</span> <span id="s390">This was a town th-the -- the -- a lot of s-small agriculture.</span> <span id="s391">Every house had a garden and my grandmother had a beanstalks, you know, which made it like a maze of -- place you c -- you could run away.</span> <span id="s392">Not far, bu -- a-and around town, there was a lot of forests.</span> <span id="s393">A lot of them escaped to the forest.</span> <span id="s394">And my grandmother ran away with two of her grandchildren, one my namesake.</span> <span id="s395">M-My aunts -- cousin of mine.</span> <span id="s396">And another cousin of mine who survived the war was in the partisans, he was a bricklayer.</span> <span id="s397">So, they needed in the partisans, you know, to build stoves in the -- in these trenches like, see?</span> <span id="s398">Those little buildings in a -- in a hole under ground and he used to build these things.</span> <span id="s399">And he escaped also to the forest, he found my grandmother na -- the next day, dead, with two kids, holding hands.</span> <span id="s400">So, I felt obligation to all of them, not -- not just my wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: Will you talk a little more about the process then, of how you actually made it happen?</span> <span id="s402">The monument.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: Well, I -- I told you before, it wa --</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: I meant --</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: I tried, I got in touch with these people with the -- ma -- build these monuments.</span> <span id="s406">You -- They made a business out of it, not just monuments for the Holocau -- in general, they put in the import.</span> <span id="s407">Import -- they bring the stone.</span> <span id="s408">It is -- It is black granite.</span> <span id="s409">And they started selling, you know, for -- for local needs.</span> <span id="s410">With this, I guess this created a new industry there for them.</span> <span id="s411">So, when I got in touch with them already, I -- I spoke to them quite often on the telephone, tried to write them.</span> <span id="s412">But when they said no -- when the military said no, then I got in touch with Senator Cohen’s office here, ask him what to do, how to -- I wrote to the -- to -- to the Ukrainian embassy and I told them, you know, U-Ukraine now is the largest country in Europe.</span> <span id="s413">And I wrote them, “You are this largest country, can’t you as -- allow a piece of land f-for your former citizens?”</span> <span id="s414">They didn’t answer.</span> <span id="s415">Then, Cohen’s office told me to write -- there’s a -- in Washington an agency -- American Commission for the Preservation of Historic si -- US historic sites abroad, which includes Holocaust sites.</span> <span id="s416">And they wrote to the embassy.</span> <span id="s417">And Senator Cohen wrote to the embassy, no answer.</span> <span id="s418">When we came back in 19 -- in 1995, when I ca -- we went to Israel.</span> <span id="s419">We had planned to go to Israel and from Israel to go to -- to the -- to -- to -- to Ukraine.</span> <span id="s420">But since we couldn’t make it, you know, we went a year later, we went to Israel anyway, to see our daughter, kids.</span> <span id="s421">And when I came back, there was a letter to the commission, that they understand I’m going to Povorsk to sup -- put up a monument to my -- for my parents.</span> <span id="s422">I don’t know where they got this idea.</span> <span id="s423">The monument was already there, it was standing already.</span> <span id="s424">And they promise that the local authorities will cooperate with me to make it possible, which was great.</span> <span id="s425">But there was no civilians, not ci -- nobody came from the local population.</span> <span id="s426">If we go now, I’ll -- my brother, we decided, if we go, we go for a few days, we walk around among -- among the civilians of the village and find out -- I -- I am sure there are some people my age or a little younger, even, that will remember our family.</span> <span id="s427">I know what ha -- you know what happened, there is nothing to find out, see?</span> <span id="s428">They’re there and is the right place, because I have a picture of this place.</span> <span id="s429">A friend of mine sent somebody there while he’s in the Ukraine, he say -- gave him a -- filled up his car with -- a Ukrainian -- with gas and he gave him a camera with film, take pictures of this place.</span> <span id="s430">He did and there was a lot of bones lying on the ground, cause he’s holding one bone that looks like a human.</span> <span id="s431">As a matter of fact, one of us -- one of this -- from Boston fellow, found a little bone and I gis -- gave it to the local police to send the -- to FBI l-lab to -- it turned out was not human.</span> <span id="s432">I don’t know, it was -- I don’t know if they parted with it, but anyway, he told me, it’s not human, that’s just -- so, it was -- it took -- took -- it didn’t take this long, it took several years, but the dream was there, th-the obsession was there -- the -- th-the -- it was very important.</span> <span id="s433">So this is, if I accomplished anything in my life, this is the thing, the most important thing I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: What was it then that made -- I mean, yo-you mentioned before we started the tapes that when you did your interview with the Holocaust museum -- your video interview eight years ago, that you hadn’t told the story about your first wife and your son.</span> <span id="s435">What happened that made you feel really --</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: I don’t know, just too -- too painful about my son and the -- the marriage was a misalliance.</span> <span id="s437">I -- I cannot talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: Will you say -- I -- It sounds as if your family had a long history in the town where you were born.</span> <span id="s439">Just for the record, will you say something about you family’s history in that area?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: Well, it’s -- was a town, you know, which, like most small towns that size, was mixed Ukrainian and Jewish.</span> <span id="s441">It was -- I -- I can still picture the way it looked.</span> <span id="s442">There was a big marketplace, like in a square, in the middle of town.</span> <span id="s443">And right in the center was the u -- the Ukrainian church, which is the same, the provis -- they called it provis lauw -- the Russian Orthodox church used to be there.</span> <span id="s444">And ri-right next to it, almost, in the square -- not in the middle of the square, but among the houses, was the Jewish synagogue.</span> <span id="s445">And ar -- and all the center was occupied by Jewish homes.</span> <span id="s446">A little out further, there were peasants, Ukrainian peasants, who had their parcels of land on them, and they were now basically agricultural people, you know, they grew -- grew stuff.</span> <span id="s447">The Jews in this town were all artisans.</span> <span id="s448">Blacksmiths, carpenters, who built furniture and houses and all kinds of carpentry.</span> <span id="s449">Tailors, who work for the local non-Jewish population mostly, but they were the majority.</span> <span id="s450">They used to go to villages where -- for six months, to build a house or to sew clothes for a couple who got married, you know, stayed there.</span> <span id="s451">They were all very pious.</span> <span id="s452">Used to go, when they were in town, they used to go three times a day to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s453">Lately, not so much.</span> <span id="s454">Most of them had grown beards, the majority, except after the s-second World War, there were some that did shave their -- their faces.</span> <span id="s455">They were strong believers in a rab -- Hasidic rabe, which exists now in New York.</span> <span id="s456">It was called a stollena chasidim.</span> <span id="s457">It was a typical, what we called -- we lived in the next town, it was only 12 kilometers away, the same kind of people, we called them backward, cause they were very observant.</span> <span id="s458">But there was no railroad sta -- the railroad station was six kilometers away.</span> <span id="s459">So you had to, if you’re going to go by tra -- by train, you had to walk to the railroad station or take a horse and wagon.</span> <span id="s460">I -- And this was the kind of -- and there was ha -- at least half of the -- half of the town were Kirzners, my mother’s maiden name.</span> <span id="s461">And they were -- And I don’t know even how they were related, but the one I knew were very close, cousins, uncles, aunts.</span> <span id="s462">There must have been at least 70 to a hundred people perished of my relatives.</span> <span id="s463">I had two grandmother that -- wa -- one died a natural death many years ago and the other one I told you, was found, was running away with two grandchildren.</span> <span id="s464">I had the cousins by the dozens.</span> <span id="s465">This was the kind of a town it was.</span> <span id="s466">In th -- As I told you before, we -- we -- I lived in a town that was new.</span> <span id="s467">This one had a tradition way back, it was for generations -- during the war, the first World War, it was occupied by the Germans and they evacuated us.</span> <span id="s468">I was born during the first World War and we were evacuated into the hinterland -- German, by Austro-Hungarians, which operated this sector of the front.</span> <span id="s469">I remember mother used to tell me I was probably s-six months old, it was January, I was born in July.</span> <span id="s470">So, I was about five, six months old and they evacuate us in -- in cattle cars.</span> <span id="s471">Later Hitler used this for -- for sending -- but it was not -- these were not evacuated for -- to -- to -- to die, they were evacu -- to -- to save their lives, s-so they can move the front, you know, they we -- without hindrance by [indecipherable] civilian population.</span> <span id="s472">And when I ca -- When you came to the destination, which was only about 50 to 60 miles away, I was half frozen.</span> <span id="s473">So the Hungarian soldiers who operated that sector of the front, threw me -- they stood -- to -- stood in a line and threw me from hand to hand til they revived me.</span> <span id="s474">Later in, the same Hungarians sent Jews to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s475">See the difference?</span> <span id="s476">That’s why a lot of people did not escape, because we knew the Germans from the first World War.</span> <span id="s477">My father spoke Germans perfe -- German perfectly, and he worked for the Germans the first World War, as an interpreter.</span> <span id="s478">And who would expect that the most civilized country in Europe -- nobody believed -- just the Germans who didn’t believe it -- that last long, so that we, who lived under the Germans in the first World War, we were waiting for them.</span> <span id="s479">Because the Czarist -- th-the -- the enemy was the Czarist army, the Cossacks.</span> <span id="s480">See, there was no Jewish officers in the -- in the Czarist army, but there were Jewish officers in the German army.</span> <span id="s481">Or in the Hungarian -- Hungaria -- the Austro-Hungarian army.</span> <span id="s482">So nobody expected it.</span> <span id="s483">A lot of them could have been saved, a lot of them could have been evacuated.</span> <span id="s484">My parents could have.</span> <span id="s485">But how do you leave?</span> <span id="s486">You have a home, you have a cow, you have a -- a barn, you have -- you know, everything there.</span> <span id="s487">Not -- Not much, but a place to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: Will you say something about your mother?</span> <span id="s489">I don’t think we’ve heard anything about her.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: M-M-My mom, she’s an housewi -- housewife, worked very hard.</span> <span id="s491">She was a excellent cook and baker.</span> <span id="s492">She used to bake whe -- even though there were several bakers, she used to bake bread and we used to sell it at a little store.</span> <span id="s493">And we also kept -- she has a few -- one, two boarders, used to come for dinner in our house and sometimes -- there was no hotel in this village, so she used to also ser -- have a room prepared in case somebody came and decided to stay overnight, to stay over there.</span> <span id="s494">Hard working, good mother, wonderful lady.</span> <span id="s495">And had a tough life.</span> <span id="s496">So we -- did we all.</span> <span id="s497">My fa-father was the -- the learned Jew in town.</span> <span id="s498">He used to -- He used to write -- if they had to petition the court -- which was in the big city used to come to my father to write petition, it was to be in Polish, very few people knew Polish.</span> <span id="s499">Very few people knew Russian before that.</span> <span id="s500">He spoke both of them.</span> <span id="s501">Three of them were German, Russian and ba -- and Hebrew of course.</span> <span id="s502">But I think I inherited his ability to languages.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: Do you still have a -- a strong interest in languages?</span> <span id="s504">A: Oh, very much so.</span> <span id="s505">I -- Now I don’t so mu -- I used to -- I used to teach Hebrew and Yiddish.</span> <span id="s506">I taught a course here in Portland High School, evening classes, in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s507">I had some student, non-Jewish, took Yiddish.</span> <span id="s508">And then I had a course in the temple for Hebrew.</span> <span id="s509">I had one in Florida, where we lived now, a Hebrew class, but it dwindled.</span> <span id="s510">It’s a very few.</span> <span id="s511">I was the official interpreter here for many years and for the Maine Medical Center, the county jail and police station and Diocese Refugee Resettlement Center and the Jewish Federation Settlement Center.</span> <span id="s512">All the Jews that came in from Russia all went through me.</span> <span id="s513">I was their first -- I met them at the plane, somebody else brought the flowers.</span> <span id="s514">I greeted them in their own language.</span> <span id="s515">We took them over to the apartment which we’d prepared, with a refrigerator full of groceries for at least a week.</span> <span id="s516">Take their kid to schools, every new immigrant had to be taken to the hospital for a tuberculosis test, that was my job.</span> <span id="s517">I -- I had to translate -- the women had to be examined and I had to find the words for mun -- the -- the monthly period and so many things I had to look up in the dictionary.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: How did you become involved in that?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: Because I was the only one here that knew these languages.</span> <span id="s520">Nobody knew them.</span> <span id="s521">Later on, some of them -- a few years later, some of them did do it.</span> <span id="s522">But the -- the diocese, which took care, you know, of the non-Jewish immigrants, for the state resettlement center, needed Polish interpreters.</span> <span id="s523">So, they had some of their own, but ga -- you -- you know, you never can find -- when you need -- all of a sudden you need somebody, it’s -- it’s -- I was on call.</span> <span id="s524">The -- The immigration department has an office here in Portland and they caught some Poles who bought Social Security numbers -- cards in New York, at 50 dollars apiece and they worked in a fancy hotel in Kennebunk.</span> <span id="s525">They got -- are illegal immigrants -- to read them their rights.</span> <span id="s526">Called me up in the middle of the night, little girl got sick, Polish and they don’t speak English and they don’t know how to explain to the doctor when they -- they won’t do anything until they know what -- what they can and can not do.</span> <span id="s527">Three in the morning, two in the morning, come over there and we -- it has it’s rewards, though, you see -- you come there and within minutes, you explain to them what the girls might be allergic to something, or they give her a shot or something and the girl starts smiling.</span> <span id="s528">Great.</span> <span id="s529">An-And I had a prejudice, you know, I had to fight my prejudice against Poles, cause I knew how they treated us.</span> <span id="s530">But it’s not their fault.</span> <span id="s531">Not their fault, so -- so you had to -- it -- it isn’t always easy.</span> <span id="s532">You -- Sometimes you -- Derogatory remarks about Jews from the same people you are trying to help, see?</span> <span id="s533">You’re not -- you know, unwillingly, i-i-it sticks through, you know, sticks through.</span> <span id="s534">I had one fellow that I work with, he was -- he -- he had an accident, he worked in the construction and he couldn’t work.</span> <span id="s535">He lifted something and disc came out and they operated on him, probably they shouldn’t have operated.</span> <span id="s536">And he -- But he knew how to collect workmen’s compensation for several years.</span> <span id="s537">And he comes to -- he’s not employed and he says he -- but he went to Florida, you try a place where there are no Blacks.</span> <span id="s538">I’m sure he’ll look where there are not Jews either.</span> <span id="s539">He even -- I says, “What do you got against Black?”</span> <span id="s540">He says, “I have nothing against them, but I don’t want to l-live near.”</span> <span id="s541">Yo-You -- You know, you -- there’s a -- subtle ways of -- to show your, you know, discrimination and hatred and all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: D-Does everybody you work with know that you’re Jewish in these cases?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s544">Well th-the Jewish, of course, immigrants knew and they also knew, they knew they were -- I’m Jewish.</span> <span id="s545">I never made any secret of it.</span> <span id="s546">And never made any secret of when it was dangerous.</span> <span id="s547">I lived in Russia with the Russian people in the coal mines [indecipherable], they wonder how come you are -- you are the only one working here and the -- the director of the mine is a Jew.</span> <span id="s548">Little did they know I -- he is another [indecipherable] kind of a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: This is tape two, side A, of an interview with Jerry Slivka.</span> <span id="s551">So, even -- I -- I was curious about that, when you mentioned about your time in the coal mines and you were talk -- you just said that you didn’t make any secret of -- of being a Jew, I was wondering di -- how -- how people knew that you were Jewish.</span> <span id="s552">Did you -- Did you tell them or did they just know --</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: Oh yeah, yeah [indecipherable] they -- they -- they couldn’t tell, because my Russian was perfect, I spoke only Russian there, I lived there for several years with them.</span> <span id="s554">I -- I adopted their -- their mannerism, adopted their way.</span> <span id="s555">But ma -- every so often, we talked about this and I was -- I was not -- made no secret of it.</span> <span id="s556">I told them that there are good Jews and there are bad Jews as [indecipherable] good Russians and bad Russians and good Ukrainians and bad Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s557">And I remember one fellow who was -- he was talking about -- I know this -- he was anti-Semitic, no question about and he was talking out about me and talk about the -- the director of the -- the -- the mine, and so -- and I say -- and I told him -- his name was Vanya, which is short for Ivan, I says -- I say, “Look, every Russianality has it’s bad and -- and good people, every national -- every nationality has bad traits as a nationality, you know, get bad ones and good one,” I says, “but in you,” I says, “all the bad ones.</span> <span id="s558">Jewish, Ukrainian, Russian, are concentrated in you.”</span> <span id="s559">Shut him up right away.</span> <span id="s560">Didn’t know what to say.</span> <span id="s561">So I was -- I was not afraid.</span> <span id="s562">That time especially, th -- it was a crime to -- to show national intolerance -- with Stalin, for calling somebody a dirty Jew or a kike or that -- any -- any kind of nationality, that’s 15 years in jail.</span> <span id="s563">Later on, it became official policy, anti-Semitism, but not in that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: Can you talk more about your relationship with Communism?</span> <span id="s565">I mean, back then you were -- you were somewhat -- I -- I -- I’m interested in your perspective on Communism back in the 19 -- I guess it was 1941 when you were working with the Communist Youth League, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: [inaudible] I like we start a little earlier?</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: When I was young, my teenagers -- teenaged years, youngsters in Poland were very busy in politics.</span> <span id="s569">We have nothing else to do.</span> <span id="s570">There was no work, there wa -- we had to find the enemy and who the enemy was, who knows?</span> <span id="s571">The Poles were course, hated -- hated us.</span> <span id="s572">We didn’t see any future for ourselves as Jews -- y-young -- Jewish youngsters.</span> <span id="s573">So we -- first of all, I wer -- I was probably 14 -15, is I joined the group Socialist Zionists, the Shamara Zaheer and then the -- they’re the one that pioneered in Israel, in the kibbutzim, way to the left.</span> <span id="s574">The atheist Socialist Nationalist Jews.</span> <span id="s575">Then the -- I -- I didn’t like this kind of Socialism, so I became a Rightist youngster, you know for the -- was -- with -- they called it that time, the Revisionist Zionist again, Zionist again.</span> <span id="s576">And I was disappointed then and because it was somewhat semi-Fascist, the -- the uniforms were brown like -- like German SS.</span> <span id="s577">That what -- they had it before the German SS, you know, but I mean, there was fights between the left and the right and I was basically Zionist, but not -- I -- I don’t know what the solution would be, to -- I -- a Jewish homeland and Palestine or not the Jewish homeland and Palestine.</span> <span id="s578">So if you’re born here, we should have the rights here.</span> <span id="s579">So I joined the group, which was anti-Fascist.</span> <span id="s580">Little did I know the anti-Fascist group was a -- the poli -- this Communist party was illegal in Poland.</span> <span id="s581">This was a way for them to -- from within, to come into the -- some kind of legal way and this was the anti-Fascist, they preached Socialist unity among the Je -- Je-Jewish Socialist parties -- so cal -- so called progressive, Polish so called progressive and they f-formed this, but later on I realized this was a Communist front.</span> <span id="s582">So I quit this party.</span> <span id="s583">But I -- I loved the Hebrew language, you know, I -- I was educated in it and the Communist forbid -- forbade Zionism and the language -- not just Zionism, but the language.</span> <span id="s584">Yiddish was the language.</span> <span id="s585">I says, “Why can’t we have two languages?</span> <span id="s586">It’s a language that we -- you know, it’s -- is a l -- you know, come -- is already several thousand years in our history, why should we abandon?</span> <span id="s587">It’s a beautiful language, I like it.”</span> <span id="s588">So, I could not fit in into a frame.</span> <span id="s589">I could not fi -- I -- I couldn’t be a Communist.</span> <span id="s590">I was a Zionist -- a partial Zionist.</span> <span id="s591">I had my own ideas.</span> <span id="s592">The same with religion, I was not -- I could not conform to the official religion.</span> <span id="s593">I had atheistic or agnostic -- I don’t know -- feelings, see?</span> <span id="s594">But like -- like many others, I didn’t know what -- I couldn’t make -- I -- I -- til this day I don’t know what I want, and I’m sure that many other people don’t either.</span> <span id="s595">Then came the Communists, in 1939.</span> <span id="s596">Even though what I didn’t know what’s going on in the Soviet Union, I saw right away something is wrong there.</span> <span id="s597">First of all, they arrested Communists, who was -- one jail -- spent in jail, idealists, people idealist with -- spent in Polish jail five, 10 years, for nothing.</span> <span id="s598">For raising a red flag, for speaking out against the government, they were sent away.</span> <span id="s599">Th-They’d say -- when they came in, the ri -- the first victims were these people, they sent them away.</span> <span id="s600">I got a -- I -- I worked -- during the beginning, I tried to organize a school that will t-teach Yiddish, because since we didn’t have enough population to -- to introduce the Yiddish language, Yiddish history, Jewish history, into the curriculum [indecipherable] my 20’s, [indecipherable] are married, a-a-and -- and then to the Ukrainian school, because the -- the majority were the Ukrainian, and they rebuffed me.</span> <span id="s601">It all -- It all -- They almost accused me of being Nationalist and this was a big -- oh, either Nationalist or Cosmopolitan, both of them were non-kosher.</span> <span id="s602">So I gave up, I couldn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s603">I got a job, because I was doing a good job for th -- I was -- you know, I ha -- I worked with the -- at that time there were Yiddish papers that came from Kiev and in the beginning were the honeymoon.</span> <span id="s604">So, the local pol -- di -- g-ga-gave me the job of managing the local store.</span> <span id="s605">There wasn’t much in it, but whatever was, I was the first one that I could use for myself, see?</span> <span id="s606">And my family.</span> <span id="s607">And my father got the job because he spoke Russian perfectly.</span> <span id="s608">I didn’t speak Russian, but I -- I knew Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s609">Never learned it, but from the -- we lived among the Ukrainians, I knew Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s610">Then, the war started and I left.</span> <span id="s611">I was in the army and when I came there, they -- they -- because -- I -- I -- I -- I fell into -- it’s a long story, I don’t -- not trying to tell the whole thing.</span> <span id="s612">I was in -- in -- in German encirclement and I risked my life to get out of there and they took and they put me on the front and then they took me off the front, because I was -- I am unreliable, because I was -- lived in Poland before ‘39.</span> <span id="s613">Thousands and thousands and thousands of people, they took out the front.</span> <span id="s614">They didn’t take off local Ukrainians, who deserted every day from the place where I was.</span> <span id="s615">I did not desert, because I know desertion mean death.</span> <span id="s616">Th-The Germans capture me, that’s -- that’s it, it’ll be the end.</span> <span id="s617">So -- and then they put me on -- on the build-building a railroad.</span> <span id="s618">It’s already the second year of the war and -- near Stalingrad, on the other side of the Volga, because there was none there to put on this side -- on the east -- west side -- you never know which [indecipherable] it was.</span> <span id="s619">And we build this railroad and it was built by the NKVD.</span> <span id="s620">This is the -- the secret police, th-the -- the prison authorities.</span> <span id="s621">And they took us as work battalions -- military work battalions, and treated just like the -- these con -- co -- con -- convicts, see?</span> <span id="s622">And these were also mostly for political crimes.</span> <span id="s623">Those who had a lot of si -- land, you know, the Kulaks and so forth.</span> <span id="s624">Some were there for next to nothing.</span> <span id="s625">They stole something from the place of work.</span> <span id="s626">Five years, 10 years, 15 years, you know, Stalin -- Stalin’s pogrom.</span> <span id="s627">Then I realized -- I saw the -- th-the real face of Communism, because I remember them and I wo-work in the coal mine and I figured if I only knew -- if Stalin only knew -- see how blind I was -- what -- what they do to us.</span> <span id="s628">Little did I know this was Stalin’s orders.</span> <span id="s629">And we build a railroad before we went in the mine, there used to be a -- a NKVD official by the name of Brienin.</span> <span id="s630">Brienin I know was a Hebrew writer and I think it must be the same family, it’s not -- it’s very unusual name.</span> <span id="s631">Because I met a girl in Portland here, she’s not a local.</span> <span id="s632">And when I told her that I remember from the Hebrew literature, we studied -- a fellow by the name Reuben Brienin, she said that’s -- was her uncle.</span> <span id="s633">She lived in -- I don’t know, Pennsylvania or somewhere.</span> <span id="s634">She knew who it was.</span> <span id="s635">He stayed in the Soviet Union and this must be a -- from this same family and he was wearing elegant white shirt -- clean, white shirt and shiny boots, with military, navy pants and he used to walk -- see - - and now we had to -- it was in the Steppests, you know, the flat land.</span> <span id="s636">We had to dig the soil out and we had to do so many cubic meters.</span> <span id="s637">An-And -- And we -- with -- and wheelbarrows, all by hand, without any machinery, go up, you know, like second floor high to put the trestle -- on the trestle and then somebody will stand there -- not one, in the hundreds, and -- and the temperature, it’ll be hard so we can put the rails on it.</span> <span id="s638">And he used to come and go with this -- check out this.</span> <span id="s639">And he was -- he looked very well fed a-and we were -- we were -- if you did the norm, that’s a five cubic yards of soil, you get a certain soup.</span> <span id="s640">There were three kinds of soup.</span> <span id="s641">Was millet -- millet, it’s -- was thicker or thinner.</span> <span id="s642">Some was from water, all the way, you know to a little thick se -- or more bread.</span> <span id="s643">An-And it was like a vicious circle, if you couldn’t make your norm, you got less to eat.</span> <span id="s644">You had less to eat, you had less strength to -- to -- to do any.</span> <span id="s645">So you were doomed.</span> <span id="s646">Luckily, this -- after four months, th-th-this was finished and I survived it.</span> <span id="s647">I went from -- probably from 150 pounds to about 100 pounds in -- in no time.</span> <span id="s648">Then I realized the real -- what the real Soviet order is, what Communism is.</span> <span id="s649">But I was supported before and I was happy because in the beginning, you know, there were Jews in high -- high officials.</span> <span id="s650">Not too many too high.</span> <span id="s651">There was one Awon Kakanovich that survived, it was -- he was Stalin’s brother-in-law, a Jew.</span> <span id="s652">The rest of them were killed afterward.</span> <span id="s653">Especially 1948, but I was out at that time.</span> <span id="s654">But it -- it was a great letdown.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: What about when you came to America and you’re here in the 1950’s and you’re in the midst of the American response to Communism during the -- the Cold War?</span> <span id="s656">Did you -- What was -- Did -- What was your understanding?</span> <span id="s657">Did you -- could you relate to American policy?</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: Oh yeah, I did relate to [indecipherable] more so -- more so, because this was a thousand percent improvement on what we had.</span> <span id="s659">I never lived in a free country.</span> <span id="s660">I came and I got a job in Woonsocket, Rhode Island.</span> <span id="s661">And Woonsocket Rhode Island’s a small town and I saw -- I -- I already started reading -- knew enough English to read a paper.</span> <span id="s662">And I saw in the paper -- this was Hanukah holiday.</span> <span id="s663">And in the local paper, there an article about Hanukah.</span> <span id="s664">The -- With a picture of a Menorah.</span> <span id="s665">The Hebrew school and so -- I couldn’t understand it, see?</span> <span id="s666">To me, this was -- no -- no American paid -- paid attention to it, it’s -- it’s normal, right?</span> <span id="s667">To me, it was not normal, it was -- it made me idealize America, even though there were many things later on I found out that I knew it was not so great.</span> <span id="s668">But compared to what we had, this was paradise.</span> <span id="s669">I made my first wages, a dollar five an hour, union wages, that’s a help on a truck.</span> <span id="s670">I was a Hebrew teacher, the gets -- first I got a job as a Hebrew teacher.</span> <span id="s671">This was 1948, there was some -- a lot of unemployment.</span> <span id="s672">Truman was just elected and they -- they thought the country’s go-going on to the dogs, economically, see?</span> <span id="s673">It was very difficult.</span> <span id="s674">So I stayed -- it was in Boston.</span> <span id="s675">So when I came, they gave me a job in a Hebrew school.</span> <span id="s676">They knew I knew Hebrew.</span> <span id="s677">Some of my relatives -- relative’s relatives in Chelsea, in Massachusetts and I came there.</span> <span id="s678">I did not -- my English was zero.</span> <span id="s679">And their Hebrew was zero -- and they gave me first a fifth grade with their teacher supervising me.</span> <span id="s680">Well, I didn’t do badly because they understood some Hebrew.</span> <span id="s681">I have a natural knack of teaching, even though I have no academic preparation for it.</span> <span id="s682">But I -- I could convey, you know, whatever I know to others.</span> <span id="s683">And I did all right, he says, “You have promise.”</span> <span id="s684">So then, there was -- th-the-then the school year ended and there was a teacher, a young lady in the first grade and her contract called for the school year, she quit.</span> <span id="s685">They decided to keep the school open another two months -- do -- two weeks or three weeks, I don’t remember what.</span> <span id="s686">The parents, they are paying tuition for the year, they wanted to have -- you know, let them have the kids another two years in scho -- two weeks in school, not to be at their backs.</span> <span id="s687">Was a small, poor town, Chelsea.</span> <span id="s688">So, they gave me this first grade.</span> <span id="s689">I am by myself with a classroom about 30 kids, don’t understand a word of Hebrew.</span> <span id="s690">They can’t read already, hardly and I don’t understand a word of Eng -- they smelled a rat right away and this was the worst time of my life.</span> <span id="s691">So, anyway, wi -- it lasted only a couple of weeks and the principal said, “Maybe start the new year, I’ll send for you.”</span> <span id="s692">Meantime I went to Woonsocket, I got this job in the -- dollar five an hour, union wages.</span> <span id="s693">Hebrew school used to pay 75 dollars a week for about three hours a day, few days a week, which was great.</span> <span id="s694">And the -- also, he ga -- they send me to the -- Boston has it -- used to have a Hebrew teacher’s college.</span> <span id="s695">Now it’s called the Hebrew college, which awards degrees, you know, the undergraduate and -- and the masters.</span> <span id="s696">They wanted to accept me in the third year -- it was a four year school, third year, nights.</span> <span id="s697">And I -- when I thought -- w-we’re -- with the kids -- September came, he sent for me, he wanted me to come and I said, “Nothing doing, I don’t want it, it’s enough.”</span> <span id="s698">So, I -- I went to -- later on, I lost the job.</span> <span id="s699">So, over the summer, I came back to Boston, I got another job and there I went to Hebrew college and they told me they’ll let me into a third -- I -- I had to take a-an exam in a few -- I -- a few subjects I did not know.</span> <span id="s700">Talmud, I think it was and some other -- Hebrew, I -- the la-language and I didn’t have problems.</span> <span id="s701">But I didn’t decide -- but I had a cousin -- my cousin’s wife, who’s to me like a sister and that -- she died already, and she says, “Working in this place is not for you.”</span> <span id="s702">It was a [indecipherable], I was a foreman there.</span> <span id="s703">It was 20 women.</span> <span id="s704">It was not easy either, but I managed.</span> <span id="s705">They pay me -- what -- came from 42 dollars a week union wages, I got 32 dollars as a supervisor, you know.</span> <span id="s706">Foreman, 32 dollars a week.</span> <span id="s707">The girl that worked there made -- the -- the -- the minimum wage went up to 75 cents an hour.</span> <span id="s708">Was 30 dol -- they -- they made more -- more than I did, almost.</span> <span id="s709">So, she says, “You have to go to school, you have to learn.</span> <span id="s710">So it’s either Hebrew college, or --” she sa -- I says, “My father was an accountant, self taught.”</span> <span id="s711">He is got some correspondence course.</span> <span id="s712">So I knew a little bit about bookkeeping.</span> <span id="s713">So I went to Bentley’s -- Bentley College, which is now a big school.</span> <span id="s714">At that [indecipherable], it was a little -- little school in Boylston Street and I took accounting.</span> <span id="s715">So, I worked for three -- three years in Boston, then we got married -- I got married, had a daughter, we came to Portland.</span> <span id="s716">So -- What were they talking about -- we talked abou-about something else, we were talking about America, America.</span> <span id="s717">I -- America I thought, to me -- to me it was the greatest country in the world.</span> <span id="s718">So, of course, I knew the Soviet Union, I knew it already.</span> <span id="s719">I kn -- I -- it was an evil empire, no question about it.</span> <span id="s720">I couldn’t see how can American defend the system they don’t know -- think about, which a lot of American did.</span> <span id="s721">There are many bad things, you know, the Nixon and this and -- McCarthy.</span> <span id="s722">But these were things that did not apply to me.</span> <span id="s723">I knew I can go anyplace -- I knew -- none -- it wasn’t easy at that time, either, Brandeis was built, because it was hard for Jewish student to go to college, they had a -- they had the certain number they would accept.</span> <span id="s724">But they were a certain number, not zero.</span> <span id="s725">Poland it was, well, not zero.</span> <span id="s726">Point point something, see?</span> <span id="s727">And we were 10 percent the population in Poland.</span> <span id="s728">And then the Soviet Union, so this, to me, is ideal, to -- I didn’t miss an election.</span> <span id="s729">I took my Americanism very, very seriously.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q: When did you become a citizen?</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: I had -- usually, it takes five years.</span> <span id="s732">So, I came in ‘48, I was entitled to be in ‘53.</span> <span id="s733">But, in ‘53, we moved to Portland and you have to be a citizen of the state for at least a year.</span> <span id="s734">So I have to wait in -- one more year.</span> <span id="s735">And Rochelle became a citizen the year after and she was the first one to be on television.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q: She didn’t tell me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: Yeah, she was on television, on the -- it was on November 11.</span> <span id="s738">November 11 she became a citizen in the supreme co -- federal court, right here.</span> <span id="s739">I became active in the Jewish organization [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s740">I became one time friend -- a neighbor said, “I would like you to come to see a group.</span> <span id="s741">We are meeting every week, you might find it interesting.”</span> <span id="s742">I was, you know, very much aware of my accent.</span> <span id="s743">I got a job here as an office manager, but still -- my accent’s still heavy, the way it is now.</span> <span id="s744">This was, you know, 1953.</span> <span id="s745">So, he took me in an-and they used to meet in the Congregational church, Woodfras Congregational Church, in the basement.</span> <span id="s746">And I come in there and the -- the group didn’t tell me what is -- what they do and what is -- it’s, “Come in, you -- you’ll like it.”</span> <span id="s747">Boucher was his name, Frenchman.</span> <span id="s748">So I come in there and it is a group of Toastmasters International, a group that learns public speaking, yeah.</span> <span id="s749">And this exactly what I needed, because I was -- I’m -- I am by nature very bashful.</span> <span id="s750">Sometimes doesn’t show so much, but I am.</span> <span id="s751">And -- And I am very much aware of my accent, which I lost -- this I lost afterward.</span> <span id="s752">Not the accent, but being -- being, you know, considering an impediment, yeah.</span> <span id="s753">It is not.</span> <span id="s754">I -- I learned that if you have to say something, people listen, even if you speak with an accent.</span> <span id="s755">So, I belong to this group and all of a sudden, when I made my first -- you have to, after a few weeks, you make your so called icebreaker speech and I told them what my story, I came to this country -- I still have it.</span> <span id="s756">And they -- they applauded, so it was great.</span> <span id="s757">And then I became active in the many other Jewish organizations.</span> <span id="s758">Jewish federation, Jewish Home for the Aged.</span> <span id="s759">I became, after -- at age 50, I quit my job and I started -- open my own office for the practice of public accounting.</span> <span id="s760">And I developed a very nice practice, people liked me, I did well.</span> <span id="s761">A few years ago, well, it’s long -- le -- it’s the nin -- 90 -- 1990, Rochelle and I and Senator Mitchell and Senator Cohen were honored.</span> <span id="s762">She told you -- I think she showed you this, this thing there.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: No, she didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: No.</span> <span id="s765">There is three of these in the state of Maine.</span> <span id="s766">One, Senator C -- Mitchell and one Senator Cohen and Rochelle and roch -- and Jerry Slivka.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Q: And this is a -- this trophy in the middle?</span></p> <p><span id="s768">A: From the Jewish community, yeah, Jewish community for work with immigrants -- work with immi -- so, this was the largest gathering of Jews in the sta -- in the history of Portland, over 600 people there.</span> <span id="s769">[indecipherable] an evening.</span> <span id="s770">So, this is another achievement I think which we are very proud of.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: And this was something you -- the immigrant work was something that you happened into because of your language ability?</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: And -- But it took ha -- ha -- that -- then it evolved from there, I imagine to where you were very --</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: Oh, well there a lot of work there.</span> <span id="s775">I knew what it means to be an immigrant.</span> <span id="s776">I felt for them, I knew and I understood them.</span> <span id="s777">I -- I know what they are talking about, see?</span> <span id="s778">And not only my -- Rochelle did a lot of work.</span> <span id="s779">We had -- We organized once a marriage for three couples, a mass marriage in the Temple.</span> <span id="s780">The rabbi, everything.</span> <span id="s781">Three couples.</span> <span id="s782">I made a Bar Mitzvah for a boy.</span> <span id="s783">Organized a dinner for a hundred, 125 people, lunch.</span> <span id="s784">I taught them to read Hebrew, then I send them to the girl to teach them to chant.</span> <span id="s785">It didn’t wor -- they -- they have nothing to do with -- with the Portland -- Jewish institutions here.</span> <span id="s786">The same people.</span> <span id="s787">I even had a funeral -- had to get -- you know, talk to the professionals in charge.</span> <span id="s788">There was no money to buy the gr -- for the grave, for the ceremony, for the casket and -- so there was a lot of work.</span> <span id="s789">I am -- Now I am an honorary member of the -- life honorary member of the Jewish Federation.</span> <span id="s790">I am life honorary member of the Jewish -- used to be the Jewish home for the aged, now it’s called Cedar’s.</span> <span id="s791">And now -- now I work mostly with the Holocaust Human Rights Center of Maine.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: Which you helped --</span></p> <p><span id="s793">A: Found.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q: To found.</span> <span id="s795">Will you say something about that?</span> <span id="s796">How is your --</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: It is a very interesting organization.</span> <span id="s798">You know, it’s a state that has not too many Jews.</span> <span id="s799">I remember when we came in the beginning, and th-the Yom HaShoah, Day of Remembrance came and we used to sit like mourners, real mourners.</span> <span id="s800">Nobody paid any attention.</span> <span id="s801">You didn’t read about it, you didn’t hear about it.</span> <span id="s802">Some congregations in Boston used to have a -- a memorial, you know.</span> <span id="s803">But Portland, nothing.</span> <span id="s804">Not in the synagogue, even to this day, nothing.</span> <span id="s805">A-And I figured, we have to do something about it.</span> <span id="s806">Gerda called me up, Gerda Haas.</span> <span id="s807">First of all, we went to Bangor, there was a theological seminary in there, non-Jewish, that wanted to have some kind -- it didn’t work out.</span> <span id="s808">So then one day she calls me, we having the -- Bates co -- Walden College had the seminar on the Holocaust, which she organized with some other professors from Walden and other colleges, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: Wha -- Arou-Around when is this?</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q: Around when is this?</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: This was a four -- about 14 years ago.</span> <span id="s813">We are celebrating Bar Mitzvah last -- last year, it’s almost 14 years.</span> <span id="s814">And there are some non-Jewish people and some Jewish people and we all going to dif -- no budget.</span> <span id="s815">There was no money.</span> <span id="s816">We operate for about two years, we run out of money and we needed -- we had an executive director, she paid very little, but we didn’t have a -- so we borrowed from a bank and we gave our per-personal signatures.</span> <span id="s817">You know, th-then we started raising more money.</span> <span id="s818">We have now budget -- not much, but for a state like Maine, 100,000 dollars, we pay 40,000 for a executive director, who does all the work.</span> <span id="s819">And we have our annual meeting, to which we bring a speaker.</span> <span id="s820">I established a little fund.</span> <span id="s821">Rochelle used to speak in schools and I used to speak and -- and the honorarium we get goes to this fund.</span> <span id="s822">And [indecipherable] 10,00 dollars, now the income from it pays for speakers once a year.</span> <span id="s823">We have a trip to Poland every two years, for teachers.</span> <span id="s824">We have two teachers seminars every year and Bates college used to have one upstate.</span> <span id="s825">This year was the first year we had only one, cause there were not enough.</span> <span id="s826">And we’re [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s827">We designed curriculum for kindergarten to fifth grade -- through fourth grade, I think.</span> <span id="s828">And then to eighth grade.</span> <span id="s829">And now they’re ta -- eight to 12.</span> <span id="s830">We’re talking about -- curriculum for eight to 12, which includes -- it’s literature based curriculum.</span> <span id="s831">Also includes Maine specific problems like the French minority in Maine and now other minority, we participate in fighting prejudice and the same time we tried to rid ourselves of prejudice.</span> <span id="s832">A few weeks ago, they dabbed the swastikas on the synagogue, Presque Isle, where there’s probably 10 Jews.</span> <span id="s833">And just the day before Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s834">Swastika with a -- said, “Burn Jews.”</span> <span id="s835">They didn’t -- still didn’t catch.</span> <span id="s836">Then there was, in another church, another town not far upstate, no Jews there.</span> <span id="s837">And they’re -- And this -- and they -- this vandalant, they caught two kids that vandalized, you know, the piano and chairs and equipment in a church, mind you.</span> <span id="s838">An-And -- End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q: Tape two, side B of an interview with Jerry Slivka.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A: What was I talking about, the --</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: Just -- Just mentioning the -- the church that was vandalized in Presque Isle.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A: Yeah, in -- just a few weeks ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: We did a lot of work against -- we had a ca -- a law -- we had a law, you know, the ho-homosexuals and the -- discrimination against homosexuals and lesbians, which when th-the -- the main religious right ga -- organized the -- a what do you call it?</span> <span id="s845">Referendum, and they voided that law.</span> <span id="s846">Trying some other way to get it, maybe a federal law or something.</span> <span id="s847">But we did a lot of good work.</span> <span id="s848">We meet once a month.</span> <span id="s849">I’m the treasurer of it as of now.</span> <span id="s850">We’re going away next -- in a few weeks, I’ll -- but we -- I have a fax and I have a telephone, I have a e-mail now, so we -- I can do the work from there.</span> <span id="s851">We have an assist-assistant so she’ll sign the checks here, if necessary, and I think we are doing great work.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Q: Can you tell me about when you first came to Maine, the atmosphere and the general level of understanding that you encountered in the Jewish community and outside, as far as understanding the Holocaust and how that has changed or not changed since the establishment of Human Rights Center and since your work here?</span></p> <p><span id="s853">A: Well, the Human Rights Center is a great influence in -- in Portland.</span> <span id="s854">Not so much among the Jewish population, I -- yeah -- it did -- we have a lot of Jewish members, no -- we -- membership is part of our budget.</span> <span id="s855">And we have a lot of -- and especially when we have the annual meeting.</span> <span id="s856">We pur -- we have about 150 - 200 people come and quite a few Jews.</span> <span id="s857">But the interest among the schools, young people mostly, is the non-Jewish schools.</span> <span id="s858">Rochelle goes to quite a few schools to speak, I go with her.</span> <span id="s859">Sometimes, when I see she is tired, I will try to answer some questions, cause sometime they’ll ask questions which she doesn’t know and I will do.</span> <span id="s860">Sometimes I speak on subjects of resistance, which I know from second hand, but still I know it, cause my brother was there.</span> <span id="s861">So I know quite a b-bit about it.</span> <span id="s862">Th-They -- Our presence is felt.</span> <span id="s863">Our presence is felt now in the state of Maine.</span> <span id="s864">As far as Maine, how did we integrate into Maine life when we came to Maine, I think sh --Rochelle told you, sh-she -- she had a hard time, very difficult time.</span> <span id="s865">I worked -- I was busy and I worked many hours.</span> <span id="s866">My job was seven days and -- and -- and two evenings.</span> <span id="s867">Six days.</span> <span id="s868">Six days and two evenings I used to work.</span> <span id="s869">And then I started building my own practice, doing some tax returns and the other -- the other five evenings, and Sundays.</span> <span id="s870">So, it was difficult.</span> <span id="s871">But I was too busy.</span> <span id="s872">She had a child, we didn’t have a car, we didn’t have a television.</span> <span id="s873">We used to sit and listen to the radio, Fibber Magee, Molly, probably not aware what it is.</span> <span id="s874">Was a very popular, you know, sitcom without TV, radio.</span> <span id="s875">A year later we got the radio and we got a car, we made some friends.</span> <span id="s876">Portland -- not just Portland, all of Maine, Jewish and non-Jewish societies, they were closed, kind of, you know.</span> <span id="s877">If you were from away, you were not born here, regardless how long you lived, you were -- you were a stranger, yeah.</span> <span id="s878">What do they know?</span> <span id="s879">Now, the thing has changed, because there a lot of people -- there a lot of newcomers and the Jewish community -- the leadership of the Jewish community are newcomers.</span> <span id="s880">At that time, when I was a director of the federation board, I was probably the only away fa -- persons.</span> <span id="s881">Now there are a lot of people, away.</span> <span id="s882">So, it doesn’t -- you don’t need the local, you know, little niche, you know, with the -- they had to join.</span> <span id="s883">You can find some people, you know, in your situation, which is -- which is mu-much, much better.</span> <span id="s884">But this was, you know, it was -- it was a provincial town.</span> <span id="s885">It isn’t now.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q: Did you experience any discrimination?</span></p> <p><span id="s887">A: As a Jew?</span> <span id="s888">No, not at all.</span> <span id="s889">It ne -- It never ca -- came t -- I never -- never had to put to -- needed to.</span> <span id="s890">I -- Pro-Probably existed.</span> <span id="s891">It existed -- I know it existed in the clubs.</span> <span id="s892">We lived across the street from Woodfras Club, our first place.</span> <span id="s893">And Woodfras Club didn’t have any Jewish members til the 60’s, when they started, you know, fighting discrimination.</span> <span id="s894">What helped?</span> <span id="s895">They to -- They didn’t give them -- for discrimin -- the state passed a law -- the organization that discriminate cannot get a liquor license.</span> <span id="s896">And this was a great deal -- without a liquor license.</span> <span id="s897">The same happened w-with Woodfras Club, the same a -- ha -- with the Elks Club, the same act with Cumberland Club, va -- ga -- Cumberland -- Cumberland Country Club, you know, with the golf course.</span> <span id="s898">Now there are -- people are fighting for Jewish membership, to get Jewish members in there.</span> <span id="s899">Jews are good to -- fundraisers, you know, Jews can -- can contribute a lot, see?</span> <span id="s900">So now there are Jewish regis -- and the -- in the Portl -- Portland cun -- Cumberland Country Club, which is in Portland.</span> <span id="s901">Things that never expected.</span> <span id="s902">There was a -- a -- that town here, Poland Springs, beautiful town on a hill, and this will be the -- beautiful hotels there and -- and the sign was no dukes -- dogs or Jews welcome.</span> <span id="s903">So what happened, a bos -- Boston Jew ca -- bought it.</span> <span id="s904">Of course it -- it wa -- out -- it’s out of business now, the motel down there.</span> <span id="s905">But, they start accept -- there’s no problem now.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q: When you started to make friends in the Portland area, who did you make friends with and how did that [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s907">A: Well, the fir -- the first one was newcomers.</span> <span id="s908">We had some friends, survivors.</span> <span id="s909">Not all of them were likable.</span> <span id="s910">Not all -- Not all of them were favorite friends, but we had something in common, at least.</span> <span id="s911">But then we kind of drifted apart.</span> <span id="s912">We found people on our level.</span> <span id="s913">Doesn’t mean that their level was lower than ours, but you found many -- th-the -- the good thing was about it, that people were seeking us out, you know, to -- as friends, which was great, much better than when you -- you are asked to be a -- not -- you’re asked, you don’t have to be a gi -- you know, people -- by the language, you know, determines, shows that somebody wants you as a friend.</span> <span id="s914">So, most of our friends are not -- well, there -- there aren’t many left.</span> <span id="s915">There aren’t any, practically, survivors.</span> <span id="s916">There’s one or two survivors that we know, we keep in touch, but that’s about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: Are -- Do you find friendships with survivors to be different in -- in [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A: No, now it -- it’s in deft, they all changed.</span> <span id="s919">They all changed, some for the worse, some for the better.</span> <span id="s920">But we don’t have to choose friend because of our common past.</span> <span id="s921">There plenty people we find -- we -- we have a friend now that doesn’t understand what it means to be a survivor.</span> <span id="s922">Sh-She’s look -- she ca -- sits right here and she looks at this and we know -- sh-she knows Rochelle is talking to her about the Holocaust and she says, “Th-This crystal, that’s your mother leave you.”</span> <span id="s923">It’s not so funny, but it’s [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s924">Your mother left.</span> <span id="s925">We da -- we don’t know what to give it to.</span> <span id="s926">Nobody wants to get that one.</span> <span id="s927">But we made -- we made our mark here on this town.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Q: Did you talk a-about your past?</span> <span id="s929">Have you always talked and have you always been able to remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s931">Have to.</span> <span id="s932">If there were listeners, we were ready to talk.</span> <span id="s933">Not for t -- not for our satisfaction, to teach, only.</span> <span id="s934">Just -- Just to let -- we are trying to make people aware what can happen if there is hatred, what can happen when there is intolerance.</span> <span id="s935">And that’s where it’s not easy, not easy.</span> <span id="s936">I can see how -- she talk -- she can be very tough.</span> <span id="s937">She wa -- I start talking and all of a sudden I break down, because see now, where -- even when I tas -- it comes through, certain things, certain happenings, I -- I have to control myself, very -- it’s very difficult to control, not to -- stop the com -- breakdown.</span> <span id="s938">She doesn’t have this problem.</span> <span id="s939">Sh-She used to -- She used to smoke, so when she used to speak before a school and get out afterwards, first thing, she’ll take a cigarette.</span> <span id="s940">Now she doesn’t.</span> <span id="s941">She had an angina attack and I convinced her not to smoke.</span> <span id="s942">It wasn’t easy, cause she thought she cannot go to the bathroom without the cigarette.</span> <span id="s943">That’s a necessities.</span> <span id="s944">I -- I says, “Try this time, try this time.”</span> <span id="s945">Slowly, gradually, she stopped smo -- she doesn’t smoke much anyway.</span> <span id="s946">I used to smoke a lot, but I gave it up.</span> <span id="s947">I -- I -- I also loved to take a drink, too, you know, in the Soviet Union, everybody drinks.</span> <span id="s948">And if you were -- if I were in the Soviet Union, I wouldn’t be alive by now, I’m sure, from the cigarettes and the drinking, I would be kaput.</span> <span id="s949">But I knew -- I needed a drink to -- being to express myself.</span> <span id="s950">Not much, just a little.</span> <span id="s951">I don’t need it now, I can do it.</span> <span id="s952">I needed a cigarette to calm my nerves.</span> <span id="s953">At that time, it had another purpose, i-it helped not to feel the hunger pains.</span> <span id="s954">You take a deep puff and you feel it right here, almost in the stomach.</span> <span id="s955">But now, I don’t need it.</span> <span id="s956">There were many mistakes we made.</span> <span id="s957">She had problems when we came and all of a sudden she finds herself in a strange town, without friends, with a little girl, confined.</span> <span id="s958">She was young.</span> <span id="s959">So she got depression, you know, from the past and all this.</span> <span id="s960">And the doctor made a mistake, he did not involve me.</span> <span id="s961">He did agree -- he treated her with, you know, a general practitioner, he treated her with pills to keep her, but we -- we should have -- as -- talked to me and talk us together and try to solve the problems we had.</span> <span id="s962">We didn’t.</span> <span id="s963">That’s a mistake we made.</span> <span id="s964">She never learned to talk to me.</span> <span id="s965">She can talk to an audience, but not to me, about herself.</span> <span id="s966">Talks about what happened to her during the Holocaust, but problems that we have, which hu-human beings do, regardless how much you might love or not love, it’s -- is -- they have problems and he -- that didn’t -- I didn’t realize -- she takes pills, it’s -- it’s all.</span> <span id="s967">We didn’t know how to relate our kids.</span> <span id="s968">We didn’t do badly.</span> <span id="s969">I think we brought up good kids.</span> <span id="s970">But, I wish I would known 40 years ago what I know now.</span> <span id="s971">We could have done better.</span> <span id="s972">But, there’s no limit.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">Q: What did -- What do you know now, that you didn’t know then, that would have been --</span></p> <p><span id="s974">A: Well, re-relationships.</span> <span id="s975">Relationship between husband and wife or a father and -- and daughter.</span> <span id="s976">We have a daughter who is overweight and we didn’t know how to stop her.</span> <span id="s977">Something was bothering, you know, you know, and we didn’t know what.</span> <span id="s978">She’s -- grew up to be a wonderful human being.</span> <span id="s979">She’s a teacher.</span> <span id="s980">She has her Master’s in education.</span> <span id="s981">Parents used to come when she used to teach class -- now, she does teach reading, you know, she has sev-several school -- used to come with -- they had once -- one kid, the sibling grew up to -- they came to the school, ask her to put her i-in Harriet’s class.</span> <span id="s982">Is excellent teacher.</span> <span id="s983">Perhaps I could have done something about it.</span> <span id="s984">Perhaps I did something wrong, which I shouldn’t have done.</span> <span id="s985">I have my doubts.</span> <span id="s986">I don’t know, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s987">People think she’s the greatest person in the world.</span> <span id="s988">She weighs probably 200 pounds, which is unhealthy.</span> <span id="s989">And every time we see her, I -- we don’t talk about it.</span> <span id="s990">I wrote her a letter a couple years ago, explaining to her how I feel.</span> <span id="s991">I cannot -- I can better express myself when I write.</span> <span id="s992">And I just asked her, “Do you -- Did you see my letter?”</span> <span id="s993">“Yes,” she said.</span> <span id="s994">“Are you going to answer?”</span> <span id="s995">“Someday.”</span> <span id="s996">Now, of course, she’s a woman in her 40’s.</span> <span id="s997">She’s not -- she’s not a kid I can tell what to do.</span> <span id="s998">But, we could have made our lifes a little easier, perhaps, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s999">But oh, there’s so much [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1001">All right.</span> <span id="s1002">It’s now October the 23rd, 1998, and we are continuing the interview with Jerry Slivka.</span> <span id="s1003">And if -- I was thinking we could go back a little.</span> <span id="s1004">We didn’t discuss so much yesterday about the period right after you had arrived in the United States and your -- and your journey to the US, and we discussed it only very briefly in your videotaped interview.</span> <span id="s1005">So why don’t we start with your journey here, and talk about --</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">A: [indecipherable] arrived in the United States --</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">Q: Yes, and -- and your trip from.</span> <span id="s1008">Where did you leave from, what was the -- what was the atmosphere on the ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">A: Well, I was in the -- I came here directly from Italy, where I stayed in a DP camp.</span> <span id="s1010">From 1946, about -- the fall of 1946.</span> <span id="s1011">I told you about my brother, my brother was there right before, couple years.</span> <span id="s1012">And I came to Austria, by the underground -- it was called the Bricha -- on the way to Israel [indecipherable] with my kibbutz.</span> <span id="s1013">And when I came to Italy, there was a telegram waiting for me at the Joint Distribution Committee, the Jewish relief organization, which had my name with that telegram from my brother, with -- and his address where he is, in which camp.</span> <span id="s1014">So I -- he -- I got it right away, I was very much amazed, this was very efficient of them to do that.</span> <span id="s1015">And I got in touch right away with my brother and then some of his friends, we used to do some business, traveling all over Italy, you know, buying sa -- u-used clothing, mostly, and selling it on the open air markets and they took me with them -- with me -- they took me with them.</span> <span id="s1016">And I came to a town called Santa Maria deBarny in the Necce -- Lecce province, near Bari.</span> <span id="s1017">It was in south -- south -- on the -- I forgot the name of -- of which one is the Adriatic and which one is the -- the other sea.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">Q: [indecipherable] on the east, on the west coast is the Adriatic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">A: Adriatic.</span> <span id="s1022">This is the -- This is the west coast.</span> <span id="s1023">The east coast is -- The east coast is Rome.</span> <span id="s1024">Naples, the east coast is the -- and this is the west coast, is right there.</span> <span id="s1025">And we stayed there in villas, these were villas -- the rich people, they used to have, you know, recreation homes, there was summer homes and winter homes, probably winter homes.</span> <span id="s1026">And -- But they were very bad shape now, for several years, nothing was done there, but it was still beautiful villas.</span> <span id="s1027">And so we stayed there for a few months and then the owners of the villas wanted to get their villas back, so they moved us to a place near Bari, a camp that was used -- it was a -- this was a Italian military camp before the war and during the war, the ge -- the Fascists kept their internees -- Jews from Germany and from Yugoslavia, were interned there.</span> <span id="s1028">Luckily, they didn’t get to them and quite a few of them survived, see?</span> <span id="s1029">So a long barracks, without ceilings in the rooms, just the -- like a -- a roof and the -- with cubicles where you lived, you know, two, three families in a -- in a little cubicle about the size of this room here.</span> <span id="s1030">We lived with -- in a house, like the administration was before, which was a similar kind of a room and there were again, four families.</span> <span id="s1031">There was a couple, friend of mine, with his wife, lived in one.</span> <span id="s1032">The partitions were with blankets, there were no -- no permanent walls there.</span> <span id="s1033">They were in one corner, my brother and wife was another corner and there was a third couple in the third corner and a fourth couple in the fourth corner.</span> <span id="s1034">The -- One of the couples was a Yugoslavian rabbi, which was a [indecipherable] not the kind of rabbis I knew that, you know, spoke Yiddish and -- they spoke Ladino, which is a Jewish language of Sephardic Jews.</span> <span id="s1035">But we realized all of a sudden, there are some common words there and this was the Hebrew th-that was mixed in with Yiddish and with this Ladino, very interest -- very interesting couple.</span> <span id="s1036">And we stayed there.</span> <span id="s1037">This camp was for people mostly who wanted to go to America.</span> <span id="s1038">They had -- most of them had relatives in America.</span> <span id="s1039">They were get in touch with them and they already -- some of them in possession of affidavits from their relatives in -- but it was impossible to come, b-because most of us were Polish born, the Polish quota was -- even though I was cha -- as I was born, it was Russia, the Russia quota wa-was empty, so the -- I finally got in in the Russian quota, but my brother couldn’t, they changed it to a German quota.</span> <span id="s1040">Anyway, a lot of people changed their place of birth in Europe, just to get in.</span> <span id="s1041">But still, I waited from 1946, until 1948, two years.</span> <span id="s1042">We did nothing there.</span> <span id="s1043">I did not go back to my kibbutz, I -- I -- I -- I had in my mind to take my brother, join back -- rejoin my kibbutz with him and then go to Israel.</span> <span id="s1044">But within a few months, they left on illegal boat.</span> <span id="s1045">You probably heard about the illegal Alliasa [indecipherable] you know, people who -- the -- the -- the Jewish agency and other Jewish organizations bought some boats that were not really seaworthy, but loaded them with -- tried to get past the -- the British pra -- blo-Blockade, to get them into Palestine.</span> <span id="s1046">Well, I didn’t go, my brother go -- already had papers from relatives.</span> <span id="s1047">We found our relatives in America, Boston.</span> <span id="s1048">And he -- he -- As a matter of fact, he put an ad to the paper, to the Jewish organizations and the -- there wa -- in the Jewish paper, in New York, Yiddish, looking for his uncle, whose name was Decter.</span> <span id="s1049">Decter -- the C is pronounced in Polish like a Z, so it sounded Dezter.</span> <span id="s1050">His name was Deecter, actually, but they changed it here to Decter, a complicated affair.</span> <span id="s1051">But he put it in the -- in the New York -- the Jewish Forwards, which still being published now, it’s a weekly, that Rupert and so, so and so’s [indecipherable] Slivka is looking for his relatives in the name of David Decter.</span> <span id="s1052">And he assumed that mo -- that most of the Jews lived in Brooklyn, see, who lived in Brooklyn, Ne-New York.</span> <span id="s1053">Course, he didn’t know, it so happened he lives in Rhode Island.</span> <span id="s1054">But my an -- aunt used to read the Yiddish paper and she found this name and through another, got in touch, It was -- It was this -- It was this -- Our uncle in Rhode Island, who [indecipherable], and that’s how he got in touch with her.</span> <span id="s1055">And then we had some relatives in Worcester, we had some relatives in Boston, and in Brighton.</span> <span id="s1056">So he got already papers.</span> <span id="s1057">I didn’t, but the minute I came, he tried to convince me that we should go to America, not to Israel, because it’s -- he had enough war, so did I.</span> <span id="s1058">He had -- He was in the partisan all through the war.</span> <span id="s1059">So, he says, “Let American Jew go fight, for I have enough fighting.”</span> <span id="s1060">And we decided not to part and I gave in and we decided we will go to America.</span> <span id="s1061">But, we waited about two years.</span> <span id="s1062">Finally, 1948, in June 19, I arrived in this country.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">Q: Before you go onto that, what di -- what were you doing during those two years?</span> <span id="s1064">You were staying in the camp [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">A: I think -- I -- My brother had a job in the local -- they call it a canteen, it was like a co-op store that used to sell some groceries, fruits, you know for the inhabitants of the camp.</span> <span id="s1066">And some had some, but not too much.</span> <span id="s1067">They used to get the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1068">Then I did the bookkeeping for them [indecipherable] a little that -- knew a little bit about bookkeeping, so prepared statements for them every month and -- and we -- and then other -- we used to go every week to buy stuff, we used to go to the -- Taranto, it’s at the -- the -- the tip -- the -- of the boot, of the boot, you know, the ma -- imagine [indecipherable] boot about here, [indecipherable] peninsula, right near Sicily.</span> <span id="s1069">Used to go buy their fruit and vegetables and some other things that people might buy.</span> <span id="s1070">And a lot of people --they used to have a truck to their disposal, you know, to bring the stuff and a lot of people used to do business, used to sneak into the truck, it’s a big, white there -- th-they didn’t have room to -- to load their stuff, because people had their merchandise an-and how do you accuse people -- not let -- they make a living this way.</span> <span id="s1071">But, we were not great businessmen, so he and I did not do any -- any business.</span> <span id="s1072">So, it was black market things, you know, just to try to get along somehow.</span> <span id="s1073">It was -- we -- it took some lessons, some less -- the -- in Italian or in English.</span> <span id="s1074">I didn’t take right away, I wasted time.</span> <span id="s1075">It was not -- I don’t know, the mood was not to study, it was kind of subdued.</span> <span id="s1076">We didn’t know we’ll be -- we’ll be able to get out, what we going to know, so the time flew by.</span> <span id="s1077">We were fed twice a day [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1078">No, once a day we used to get lunch and then they gave us produce products to prepare for ourselves a breakfast, you know, coffee and what else and bread.</span> <span id="s1079">We used to stand in line and get -- we didn’t have the utilities, we didn’t have the -- any cutlery.</span> <span id="s1080">So we used -- we used cans from margarine, which was just enough to get some soup in it, and was unbelievable life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">Q: Who was running the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">A: This was the UNRRA, United Nations Rehabilitation.</span> <span id="s1083">Lasted during distribution.</span> <span id="s1084">The Jewish camps were around during -- during distribution, subsidized by the UNRRA.</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">Q: So was this an all Jewish camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">A: No, this one was not.</span> <span id="s1087">This was Jewish and there were a lot of Yugoslav non-Jews.</span> <span id="s1088">Serbs -- mostly Serbs, they fought among themselves, Serbs and Croats and -- and Greeks, all -- all stateless, all refugees who were waiting to get to some new country [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">Q: Were these groups mixed?</span> <span id="s1090">Did you mix at all with the other --</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">A: Very little, very little.</span> <span id="s1092">We didn’t speak each other’s language, but we tried to get along somehow.</span> <span id="s1093">Sometimes there was, I mean, friction.</span> <span id="s1094">There was more friction among the Croats and the -- and the Serbs than among Jews and Yugoslavs.</span> <span id="s1095">So, but we got along somehow.</span> <span id="s1096">We got the sh -- same rations.</span> <span id="s1097">Of course we -- we used to get more rations from the Joint Distribution Committee, which took care of the Jewish refugees and then they had some other church groups that did help support them.</span> <span id="s1098">It was a community -- a funny community, all different languages, different nationalities.</span> <span id="s1099">Everybody waiting for that piece paper -- visa to go to -- to America mostly.</span> <span id="s1100">And some went to Australia with [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1101">Some went to Canada.</span> <span id="s1102">But for Jews it was very difficult.</span> <span id="s1103">[indecipherable] Canada [indecipherable] Jews and so did the United States, but finally there was a -- Truman introduced a law into Congress and they -- to let in all refugees of the second war.</span> <span id="s1104">So, finally everybody who wanted to come, did come, unless they could prove that they’re Nazi.</span> <span id="s1105">The question were -- we -- we had to go to CIA and they ask you, “Were you a prostitute, were you a Communist, were you a -- a Nazi, were you a Fascist?”</span> <span id="s1106">N-Nobody, of course would sa -- tell that he was, but -- and then we had to go through a medical examination, if you’re healthy.</span> <span id="s1107">And they checked your documents out, genuine or not.</span> <span id="s1108">But two years was a very miserable life there.</span> <span id="s1109">But we -- we organized -- tried to organize wha -- there were -- there were some children, very few, but there was some children and there was a school, a Jewish school.</span> <span id="s1110">[indecipherable] didn’t have it.</span> <span id="s1111">Was a Jewish school.</span> <span id="s1112">We had a library, Jewish and English -- not Jewi -- Yiddish and Hebrew books and some English books were located in it.</span> <span id="s1113">I learned a little -- little bit -- very, very, little English, some Italian, you know, to get along when I went to town.</span> <span id="s1114">We were -- I remember once going to the opera in -- in Bari, which was quite an event.</span> <span id="s1115">And -- But, was a miserable life.</span> <span id="s1116">Not enough food, there was food, but nothing like -- too good.</span> <span id="s1117">So, then I came in 1948, June 19th.</span> <span id="s1118">It was a Saturday.</span> <span id="s1119">It was a cloudy day, but I could see the Statue of Liberty.</span> <span id="s1120">I -- I also -- I told you before that I enjoyed the -- the cro -- End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">Q: Tape number three, side A, of an interview with Jerry Slivka.</span> <span id="s1122">So, you were saying about the Toastmasters?</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">A: Yeah, when I made my speech, the so-called icebreaking speech, is bi -- fi-first speech you make is to introduce yourself to the group.</span> <span id="s1124">I -- I entitled it the -- “I’m an American by Choice,” and I spoke about my arrival to this -- to the United States here.</span> <span id="s1125">I stood there on the deck bec -- i-it was a ship, I think it was called the Marine Perch.</span> <span id="s1126">It was a converted troop ship, so we slept -- there were no -- i-i-in the -- the bowels of the ship in -- on hammocks, like the sailors used to sleep.</span> <span id="s1127">We were women separately, men separately.</span> <span id="s1128">And I came with a cousin of mine, from Naples, who was -- he came from Thriamaca, the town where I was born, I told you about, he died later, in Washington, DC.</span> <span id="s1129">And the -- the minute we came on this ship, they served supper, and I was amazed at the -- the co -- quantity of food.</span> <span id="s1130">And -- And most, of course, the ship were Italians.</span> <span id="s1131">This was before the -- the law -- the law was already passed about mat -- matbegin, but I came as a regular immigrant, for which I paid.</span> <span id="s1132">It was paid passen -- you had to pay for -- my -- my aunt sent me the money and the boat -- I don’t remember what it cost -- it cost about 300 dollars that time.</span> <span id="s1133">Was -- Was a lot of money.</span> <span id="s1134">And the -- the Italian people stood on the deck in Naples and you know, it was a three -- three story, three decks.</span> <span id="s1135">Not a big ship, but there was a quite a few people there and they were throwing slices of bread to their relatives, so th-they -- th-the situation -- the [indecipherable] situation apparently was very bad after the war.</span> <span id="s1136">This was already two years after the war, was still -- was still occupied.</span> <span id="s1137">So -- And I -- We had tables for 10, we were assigned a table and after a few days, [indecipherable], we got to the Mediterranean, it cuts across from the Gibraltar, becomes stormy and people got sick.</span> <span id="s1138">But I -- I -- There were days when I was all alone at the table.</span> <span id="s1139">I used to take some oranges to take to my friend and we made a few more other friends, a few more that came from the camps, we met on the ship there, half a dozen people.</span> <span id="s1140">Yo-You know, we had something in common to talk about, we spoke the same language.</span> <span id="s1141">But there were there days when I was all by myself, and the waiter says -- urged me to eat.</span> <span id="s1142">He told me to [indecipherable], and I did.</span> <span id="s1143">I was always hungry, I could eat a lot at that time.</span> <span id="s1144">And I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">Q: Did you get sick?</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">A: Not at -- Not today, I -- the last few days, I got a little bit dizzy-like, you know, when we -- the -- the -- it was not too la-large a ship, it didn’t have stabilize-stabilizers in, like we have now.</span> <span id="s1147">So, it went up and down, up and down and ma -- so [indecipherable] my hat, you know, but I did not throw up, I did -- and I did not lose my appetite.</span> <span id="s1148">I could eat all the time.</span> <span id="s1149">When I came, we stood and we went through Halifax, it took about two weeks, a long time.</span> <span id="s1150">We stopped at Halifax and then we came in to New York.</span> <span id="s1151">My cousin came to pick me up, but it took some time before the -- we had to go to Custom, but the Custom didn’t take long, we -- I didn’t have much, a little suitcase with a change of underwear, that’s all.</span> <span id="s1152">And I was standing there, I was thinking about the Statue of Liberty.</span> <span id="s1153">I -- I knew about it and I knew about the inscription, which was by a Jewish girl, Emma -- Emma -- Emma Lazarus.</span> <span id="s1154">Give me your tired, you know, your poor and that -- I -- I still get a little bit emotional about it and I was thinking, “Wh-What’ll happen to me?”</span> <span id="s1155">I don’t -- I -- I -- I didn’t have any trade or profession.</span> <span id="s1156">I didn’t know the language except for a few -- a few sentences, probably.</span> <span id="s1157">And I wondered what -- what -- what’s going to happen.</span> <span id="s1158">And then I came down and I met my cousin, he was holding a picture and he thought [indecipherable] pictures, well, see, I didn’t look like my picture, because the picture would look too beautiful.</span> <span id="s1159">I was not as hand -- handsome as he thought I was from the picture.</span> <span id="s1160">And he took me to a friend of his, because he -- he had the -- his father-in-law lived with them, his wife’s father, who was a observant Jew.</span> <span id="s1161">They were observant also, but not as -- as strict.</span> <span id="s1162">And we didn’t -- couldn’t come in and it was Saturday, Shabbat, cannot -- [indecipherable] travel.</span> <span id="s1163">So we waited til sundown and we took a train to Boston, and came in and when we came to Boston, we -- Back Bays -- it was Back Bay station.</span> <span id="s1164">And we came Commonwealth Avenue, it’s a major thoroughfare in Boston and I saw a lot of cars and I thought was a -- it was a demonstration or a -- what do you call it, a -- well, like a -- like a holiday, you know?</span> <span id="s1165">There were, you know, a lot of cars, I’ve never seen this many cars in my life, even, in Naples or Rome, were no-not this many.</span> <span id="s1166">They lived just off Brighton Ave. We took -- We took a cab.</span> <span id="s1167">And we came in there and there was their family, my -- my cousin’s wife’s family.</span> <span id="s1168">They have a large family.</span> <span id="s1169">My cousin didn’t have such a bi-big -- only my aunt and he had two sisters.</span> <span id="s1170">They lived in -- one lived in Worcester, one in Woonsocket, Rhode Island.</span> <span id="s1171">They lived around Boston area and they all came to meet me.</span> <span id="s1172">Th-They were somewhat disappointed.</span> <span id="s1173">They were very observant, religious Jews and they expected somebody with a beard, you know, ear locks, and this was not it.</span> <span id="s1174">And they knew -- they knew my parents.</span> <span id="s1175">They were about the age of my parents, some of them.</span> <span id="s1176">They may -- And they knew us from home, so -- then I got, I told you, I got the -- through them, I got the jo -- some of them lived in Chelsea and I got the job in the Hebrew school.</span> <span id="s1177">That la-lasted a couple of weeks.</span> <span id="s1178">Then I went to Woonsocket and got the job in the Woolweist company, helper on a truck.</span> <span id="s1179">This was -- I work -- I made union wages.</span> <span id="s1180">I joined the union right away, a dollar five an hour.</span> <span id="s1181">And they took me into a store and bought a suit, you know, on installments, paid 50 cents a week or a dollar a week.</span> <span id="s1182">Life was good, I stayed with my aunt.</span> <span id="s1183">She lived with her daughter.</span> <span id="s1184">Her name was Decter -- Anna Decter.</span> <span id="s1185">My uncle was dead already.</span> <span id="s1186">She died a few years later from cancer.</span> <span id="s1187">She was my -- my father’s sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">Q: Where was your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">A: My brother was still in Italy.</span> <span id="s1190">E-Even though he got his papers before, I got the visa first.</span> <span id="s1191">So I came in June, and the minute I start working, I se-sent him money.</span> <span id="s1192">And -- And he came in December, same year.</span> <span id="s1193">And we both were -- h-he joined me.</span> <span id="s1194">I -- I went to pick him up at the -- he also came by boat, but this was a luxury ship, a Italian luxury ship, and -- forgot the name of it.</span> <span id="s1195">And again, we went to school, there was Americanization classes in Woonsocket, Rhode Island.</span> <span id="s1196">I was this teacher’s star pupil.</span> <span id="s1197">Name of MacIntosh, a -- a Scotsman -- Scotsman.</span> <span id="s1198">And we had -- I already had enough vocabulary so that I could talk to him and most of the class were Ukrainian women who lived -- who came before the war, but they never learned English.</span> <span id="s1199">Now, they have to become citizen of the -- Social Security started and they had to become citizens, so they had to take the same Americanization classes.</span> <span id="s1200">But they -- they didn’t know the language.</span> <span id="s1201">They spoke Ukrainian, which I understood.</span> <span id="s1202">There was a Pole, one Pole who had difficult, very difficult -- it’s very difficult to [indecipherable] the English language.</span> <span id="s1203">I -- I got it very easily, so did my brother.</span> <span id="s1204">He was -- Later, they had a show, you know, to celebrate the -- I think it was Armistice Day [inaudible] -- the melting pot.</span> <span id="s1205">A co-concept that’s not used now any more.</span> <span id="s1206">No more melting pot.</span> <span id="s1207">The [indecipherable] in style now.</span> <span id="s1208">So, but I stayed up til February -- February 20 -- I never forget this day, it was later, on February 22nd.</span> <span id="s1209">It was a -- not a -- it was the -- what holiday is February 22nd?</span> <span id="s1210">Washington?</span> <span id="s1211">February 22nd is a holiday, which was -- and Rhode Island was not -- it was [indecipherable] the -- I -- was a holiday in Massachusetts, but not in Rhode Island.</span> <span id="s1212">What -- I can’t -- can’t think of the [inaudible].</span> <span id="s1213">So, I -- I -- I was stunned, I wa -- this was the greater disappointment I ever had.</span> <span id="s1214">I already was settled and I want to go to -- I wanted to go to school, you know, take more courses there.</span> <span id="s1215">And all of a sudden, I got a slip, I’m laid off.</span> <span id="s1216">And -- And my brother got another job, also, another factory, very low, low paying jobs, and we lived with -- with our relatives.</span> <span id="s1217">They have a big house.</span> <span id="s1218">My aunt gave us her room.</span> <span id="s1219">She used to -- the house where she lived, later on she gave it to her daughter, she was with her.</span> <span id="s1220">But she had her own room and then this cousin had two dau -- two little girls.</span> <span id="s1221">So my aunt slept in their room and they gave us her room, two of us slept there.</span> <span id="s1222">And she cooked for us.</span> <span id="s1223">She made sure, in the morning [indecipherable] I leave for work, that I have hot cereal.</span> <span id="s1224">Very nice, this lady.</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">Q: Does your family talk together about the war?</span> <span id="s1226">Di-Did you talk to your family about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">A: Yes, she told them a-about.</span> <span id="s1228">And at that time, when I started talking, I -- just like now, I -- I break down, co -- even more so.</span> <span id="s1229">I just st-started crying.</span> <span id="s1230">In -- In Russia, when I heard abou -- I -- I couldn’t cry.</span> <span id="s1231">I didn’t cry til I come and I didn’t -- no, til I met my brother mi -- when we met together, here.</span> <span id="s1232">But he did not, I did.</span> <span id="s1233">Now, he cries and -- you just mention and he -- he cannot control his emotions.</span> <span id="s1234">But at that time, my aunt, who used to go -- she was a sick woman, she had hay fever -- fever.</span> <span id="s1235">So, in the summer, at the end of the summer, she used to go to the White Mountains to spend a few weeks, to ease the pain of the pollen.</span> <span id="s1236">But she stayed with us.</span> <span id="s1237">My cousins went to a few weeks vacation.</span> <span id="s1238">They went to Narragansett, Narragansett Beach.</span> <span id="s1239">But she stayed with me and my brother.</span> <span id="s1240">Oh, my brother came [inaudible].</span> <span id="s1241">She stayed with me, she cook -- and she used to put a plate of meat, with this -- and a loaf of bread and I used to clean it up in no time.</span> <span id="s1242">I probably gained 30 pounds with her, within a few weeks.</span> <span id="s1243">But I worked hard, so I would [indecipherable] some.</span> <span id="s1244">But I did not observe any diet.</span> <span id="s1245">loved to eat.</span> <span id="s1246">It was many years in which I didn’t have any decent, you know.</span> <span id="s1247">So, then, when I lost my job fa -- in February, there was a -- a group -- and every town had a group, too, just -- the work that I did later on, i-in Portland -- there were some people who did it before, they used to help refugees find jobs, find unemployment, find apartments and so forth, because there were some had families and children.</span> <span id="s1248">So, one took me over.</span> <span id="s1249">H-He had an appointment to find a job for my brother, but my brother was already working on the job, so he took me.</span> <span id="s1250">I needed a job very badly.</span> <span id="s1251">And so he took me to Boston, and I got the job in the suburb of Boston.</span> <span id="s1252">From the da -- da -- da -- 42 dollars a week, in ra -- I got to 30 -- 30 -- 35 dollars, and I became a foreman already, I kn-knew enough English and I knew a little bit about the Woolweist business, you know, textile, cause I used to work textile before the war also, in Poland.</span> <span id="s1253">So I became foreman.</span> <span id="s1254">And then the Korean war started.</span> <span id="s1255">So, this business started booming, textile.</span> <span id="s1256">They had -- need uniforms for the army and so forth [indecipherable] did.</span> <span id="s1257">We re-re-reprocess waste into new stuff.</span> <span id="s1258">And in the meantime, the fellow that I worked for, who was -- he was the chairman of the Republican party in Rhode Island.</span> <span id="s1259">And when Truman was elected [indecipherable], no sense in being in business, this is -- the -- the country is going to the dogs.</span> <span id="s1260">He made enough money during the war, so he slodi -- sold out.</span> <span id="s1261">But this fellow in Massachusetts just opened, he started buying stuff and sure enough, the Korean war started, he had warehouse full of stuff and the prices went up and price controls and -- and wage controls.</span> <span id="s1262">He says he couldn’t give me a raise, cause there’s wage controls.</span> <span id="s1263">But the higher pr-priced -- the higher paid employees, he could find, but he didn’t.</span> <span id="s1264">Anyway, I worked there for about three years, but I was -- in the meantime when I enrolled into Bentley College, which was called that time Bentley School of Accounting and Finance.</span> <span id="s1265">And that all they taught us, accounting.</span> <span id="s1266">So, it worked out all right.</span> <span id="s1267">We get a little apartment, with my brother.</span> <span id="s1268">And then my brother, who didn’t want to go to fight for, you know, for independent Israel, came to United States and he was draft age -- it wasn’t e-even his real age.</span> <span id="s1269">They -- They used to think that if you’re young as kids, easier to get in, so he changed his age.</span> <span id="s1270">When he came he was drafted, Korean war started.</span> <span id="s1271">And they drafted and took him down.</span> <span id="s1272">He spent a year in Korea.</span> <span id="s1273">So, he did not avoid this -- this war.</span> <span id="s1274">But the only good thing about it, he had, under the bill of rights, GI Bill of Rights, he could go to school and they paid the tuition.</span> <span id="s1275">So he got the degree in -- a degree -- Associate degree in Engineering and a degree in Business Administration and when he graduated, he got a job in engineering.</span> <span id="s1276">But then Boston, which is, you know, the scientific capital of, you know, state, all of a sudden there was no one with the -- war ended, the Korean war ended.</span> <span id="s1277">It was elaborate -- called elaborate electronics [indecipherable] and he lost his job.</span> <span id="s1278">So, they wanted to give him a job, transfer him, you know, to California or some -- midwest or -- and he -- he -- my sister-in-law, he meet um -- met a girl and he married her.</span> <span id="s1279">So, she didn’t want to leave Boston.</span> <span id="s1280">She went to Hebrew college, just for the fun of it, she didn’t [indecipherable] her here, she had a little kid and another one.</span> <span id="s1281">So, she didn’t want to leave Boston, so he decided run business of his own.</span> <span id="s1282">He op -- ap -- opened a little sandwich shop, which is only -- two degrees, had a little sandwich -- but he made a good living, did all right.</span> <span id="s1283">Took time.</span> <span id="s1284">And I worked in this place for three years and then I met Rochelle and we got married.</span> <span id="s1285">This is the boiler.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">Q: Will you talk about how you met Rochelle?</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">A: Well, my sister-in-law and her aunt, both Auschwitz survivors, and they were in Germany, my brother’s wife and her aunt who just died lately.</span> <span id="s1288">I -- When I tell the story, I kid about and say she’s never -- til this day she is mad at her stepm -- with her aunt because she introduced us.</span> <span id="s1289">[indecipherable] So, she invited us for dinner and it clicked, we had something in common.</span> <span id="s1290">Lots in common.</span> <span id="s1291">We decided to get married.</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">Q: What did you have in common?</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">A: Well, we have the same background, we both attended the same te -- kind of schools and we both speak Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1294">And our education was similar and we both speak Yiddish and we both survivors.</span> <span id="s1295">Of course she -- she survived in Nazi concentration camps and I was in Soviet camps.</span> <span id="s1296">But we both lost our families, so we have a lot in common.</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">Q: Were you interested in getting married at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">A: Yeah, I was.</span> <span id="s1299">I was ready to.</span> <span id="s1300">I wasn’t economically ready, but figure well, some way we’ll sa -- get along.</span> <span id="s1301">She worked.</span> <span id="s1302">I was making about 65 dollars a week and she was making 30 dollars a week.</span> <span id="s1303">But s-she -- I -- kidding, I -- I told her -- she got herself pregnant, see?</span> <span id="s1304">She says, yeah, she got herself preg -- an-and she fell, she would go by the streetcar to work and she fell off, injured herself.</span> <span id="s1305">But she went to doctors, she’s pregnant, so she quit her job, she worked only a few weeks.</span> <span id="s1306">But somehow we survived on -- on my salary.</span> <span id="s1307">She never worked since.</span> <span id="s1308">We -- We lived there for a year, in Boston.</span> <span id="s1309">We had my bachelor apartment, one room studio apartment, a highrise, like.</span> <span id="s1310">The bed that doubles into a -- so-sofa that doubles into a bed.</span> <span id="s1311">And we had this table there [indecipherable] a gate-like table, it opens up to seat 12.</span> <span id="s1312">We had party, had 12 people for dinner.</span> <span id="s1313">There was a kitchenette and a bathroom, and we managed somehow.</span> <span id="s1314">After a year, we took -- I graduated and I looked for a job and again, it was very difficult to get -- they used to start a junior in accounting at that time for half what I was getting my job.</span> <span id="s1315">So finally, we -- we went -- she had an uncle in Pittsfield, we went to visit them.</span> <span id="s1316">He wa -- H-He died, but his widow and the kids were -- the son was there, his business, he wanted to go partner and I was not cut out to be this kind of business.</span> <span id="s1317">But I was looking for an office job.</span> <span id="s1318">So, nothing came of it.</span> <span id="s1319">It was -- the [indecipherable], then we stopped in Portland, we went by train.</span> <span id="s1320">We stopped in Portland, because she had an aunt here also.</span> <span id="s1321">And her husband -- she was very lonely, she was a sick woman.</span> <span id="s1322">Her husband was a doctor and he was overprotective.</span> <span id="s1323">She didn’t go out, she was sitting in the house, and -- and she was very -- she just fell in love with our little girl.</span> <span id="s1324">We had a little girl, three months old.</span> <span id="s1325">She said, “Why don’t you move to Portland?”</span> <span id="s1326">So jokingly, I say, “All right.</span> <span id="s1327">Find me a job and we move to Portland.”</span> <span id="s1328">Came home and in two days she calls me, couple interviews.</span> <span id="s1329">I came and I worked -- I got on this job of office manager for a large furniture store that had -- small chain, they had three stores.</span> <span id="s1330">Did the bookkeeping and took care of the shipping and everything, except selling.</span> <span id="s1331">Selling I never could do, never knew how.</span> <span id="s1332">So, I worked for them for 13 years.</span> <span id="s1333">And then same time, I built up -- I took in some tax work, it was evenings, I was working sec -- six days and two evenings, the store was open.</span> <span id="s1334">And finally I said, I want to work only 40 hours.</span> <span id="s1335">Because I got enough to do besides that.</span> <span id="s1336">And then I gave them notice and I am trying to open my own office.</span> <span id="s1337">So, luckily, the auditor -- our auditor died -- luckily, I feel -- it so happened, it was [indecipherable] feel bad, he was a nice man.</span> <span id="s1338">And this -- this was my first substantial account, I took it over.</span> <span id="s1339">Was, you know, tack -- it was -- he died just before he got to do audit -- to prepare the tax returns for the -- for the year.</span> <span id="s1340">So, at age 50, I left a job, which paid a decent salary, to go on my own.</span> <span id="s1341">I didn’t get along with the manager, the manager thought that I am after his job, which I never -- never intended to.</span> <span id="s1342">Afterward, we became very good friends -- after I quit.</span> <span id="s1343">And he died also and the -- the fellow I worked for was a very rich man by standards of 40 years ago --yeah, almost 40 -- and he -- he didn’t have any children.</span> <span id="s1344">So all his money that he left, went into a foundation -- a charitable foundation, he was a very charitable man.</span> <span id="s1345">And I was appointed the trustee to this foundation.</span> <span id="s1346">So until this day, I [indecipherable] enough, and it was a little less than a million now, so about a million and a half dollars.</span> <span id="s1347">And we give away in between 80 and 100,000 dollars a year to charities, to local [indecipherable] of all, religious synagogue he belonged to -- he built a synagogue and a Hebrew day school.</span> <span id="s1348">And then the Maine Medical Center, which used to be that time, the [inaudible] they used that -- wait a minute, now it’s Maine Medical Center.</span> <span id="s1349">And he [indecipherable] fund all the Jewish and non-Jewish.</span> <span id="s1350">[indecipherable] be having a meeting next week, to meet with the supervisory board that has to approve our grants.</span> <span id="s1351">We have no -- no -- we cannot -- all we can do, approve or not approve, but I mean, the power of the [indecipherable] is ours, myself and one more trustee, which I appointed.</span> <span id="s1352">There was a -- a relative of his before, and he died, so I appoint another in the back of three trustees.</span> <span id="s1353">Until this day, we give away a lot of money.</span> <span id="s1354">Built the -- Now, they are fixing the cemetery where he is buried.</span> <span id="s1355">We pledged them 50,000 dollars.</span> <span id="s1356">And the Hebrew school, which was -- they’re trying to revive, it doesn’t work.</span> <span id="s1357">Not enough parents, [indecipherable] but now this year, there’s a lot of young people who want their ki-kids to have a Hebrew education, trying to revive this Hebrew day school, a school which gives secular end religious education.</span> <span id="s1358">And we gave them 45,000 dollars, too.</span> <span id="s1359">A matching grant, they have to -- can raise another 45 to get the an educator and an organizer to try to get the school.</span> <span id="s1360">So, this is another thing I’m busy with.</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">Q: Has --</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">A: What -- What I’m busy now is with the Holocaust Center.</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">Q: Ha-Has your work been, and your career been an important part of your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">A: Very much so, certainly.</span> <span id="s1365">I -- I always -- since I -- we came to Portland [indecipherable] couple of years when I -- before I settled -- after I settled, became known and I started working, I was appointed to the [indecipherable] board.</span> <span id="s1366">So I have been active in every Jewish organization in town.</span> <span id="s1367">And the one -- for a few years I was in the Toastmaster’s International.</span> <span id="s1368">I was treasurer -- always treasurer, never president.</span> <span id="s1369">And -- So I was busy.</span> <span id="s1370">The -- Then the immigrants start coming and the city need -- needed interpreters for several -- I -- I was registered, I told you yesterday, f-for -- I was interpreter of five languages.</span> <span id="s1371">There’s Hebrew, Yiddish, there’s Russian, Ukrainian and Polish.</span> <span id="s1372">I worked in all of them.</span> <span id="s1373">I even -- I wo-worked with Czechs, I don’t know Czech, but is similar to Polish, so -- and they didn’t have anybody.</span> <span id="s1374">Then I worked to some Bulgarians, was like Russian.</span> <span id="s1375">Very similar to Russian.</span> <span id="s1376">And then I worked with the group -- with the -- our sister city is Ar-Archangel, so we used -- exchanged immigrations every year and I used to work with them to go visit, to translate for them.</span> <span id="s1377">They were very happy with me, they liked it, because they had -- I came in once and they had one -- one group, they were, I told you, tourist group.</span> <span id="s1378">I worked with them.</span> <span id="s1379">We have no problem.</span> <span id="s1380">But there’s another group, I think it’s fisheries.</span> <span id="s1381">[indecipherable] the fishing industry.</span> <span id="s1382">And there was a fellow sitting there -- he -- their interpreter, with two big dictionaries and he wanted to transfer some -- translate something, started looking up.</span> <span id="s1383">So I very seldom had to look up a word.</span> <span id="s1384">Now I -- I can -- can’t remember, but 10 years ago, five years ago, I still could remember.</span> <span id="s1385">And then I heard them say, “We were lucky, we got a very good interpreter [indecipherable].”</span> <span id="s1386">So, the other group came over to me and asked me to try to do something, I says, “I -- I cannot mix in, you know.</span> <span id="s1387">They -- You have your -- it wouldn’t -- wouldn’t be nice to, you know, try to mix in to somebody else’s business,” I says.</span> <span id="s1388">Th-They had one Russian who spoke some English, so somehow they got along all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">Q: And was this all volunteer work, your interpreting?</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">A: All volunteer, all volunteer.</span> <span id="s1391">No pay -- used to do some quite often [indecipherable] pick you up [indecipherable] hospital or jail, police, immigration department.</span> <span id="s1392">A lot of work.</span> <span id="s1393">And got busy and Rochelle busy now, speaking with the schools, and I go with her.</span> <span id="s1394">Sometimes I participate in her -- when they ask -- start asking questions.</span> <span id="s1395">I’m a little older, so I remember what happened.</span> <span id="s1396">How life was in Poland they want to know, she does not remember.</span> <span id="s1397">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">Q: Do you speak about your experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1400">I -- I talk also about -- about resistance, because my brother told me a lot about -- it’s a subject that’s not known too well.</span> <span id="s1401">Very -- Lately, they write something about.</span> <span id="s1402">Was quite a few b -- few books written lately that are -- that seems -- End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">Q: Tape three, side B, of an interview with Jerry Slivka.</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">A: And th-there were times when survivors did not want to speak.</span> <span id="s1405">Now everybody writes books.</span> <span id="s1406">Some are good, some are not so good.</span> <span id="s1407">It’s a -- It’s a good thing.</span> <span id="s1408">It’s a -- So, to be on the -- it -- it will be a short time before all of us are gone, you know.</span> <span id="s1409">I am 83.</span> <span id="s1410">Some are a little younger and some a little older.</span> <span id="s1411">So -- And every so often you hear -- some of our friends are gone, died.</span> <span id="s1412">So, if there’s nothing left, might be forgotten.</span> <span id="s1413">And it shouldn’t be forgotten.</span> <span id="s1414">Because it’s still happening, you know, th-the ethnic cleansing, what’s going on in the former Yugoslavia and all over the world, not just there.</span> <span id="s1415">And if we don’t teach it to the future generations, this might repeat itself.</span> <span id="s1416">But there’s not compare -- it never happened, such a tragedy, you know, i-in Jewish history or in an-any oth -- any other history, where the -- a -- a -- pr -- people developed a -- designed a program to destroy another people, using all means available to them.</span> <span id="s1417">For -- For using their technique, they’re using their sophistication just to kill people.</span> <span id="s1418">So it never happened before, and it ha -- we -- so -- so it -- it’s incumbent upon us to see to it that it -- it doesn’t happen again, to anybody.</span> <span id="s1419">We try to do all we can to prevent it.</span> <span id="s1420">So, I’m thinking maybe I’m doing a very good job, the Maine Holocaust [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1421">But, by the way, we are on the internet.</span> <span id="s1422">We have a page you can look it up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">Q: Will you say a little bit about your relationship with your brother, that’s been an important --</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">A: Oh yes, w-we are friends -- the ca -- I wish all brothers would be so close, we’re very close.</span> <span id="s1425">I have a little problem with him, he’s very generous.</span> <span id="s1426">We come t -- go out to eat and we fight, who -- who going to pay -- pick up the check, th -- sa -- sa -- somehow I gave in with him.</span> <span id="s1427">I have a problem now with him.</span> <span id="s1428">I used to do his tax return.</span> <span id="s1429">His and his kids.</span> <span id="s1430">Of course, I never charged him for it, never dream of charging him.</span> <span id="s1431">And now I got a co -- I got a computer.</span> <span id="s1432">Last year, I did my -- my tax re -- did theirs by hand, an-and a friend of mine who had a computer did mine on computer.</span> <span id="s1433">An-And it was a -- came out exactly -- so, I ga -- I do th -- there’s also my -- my sister-in-law’s aunt, who died a few months ago, and I did hers.</span> <span id="s1434">And his daughter, ma -- my niece, has a computer.</span> <span id="s1435">She -- She’s a lawyer now, as a matter of fact, she works -- she has a job, she didn’t want this, you know, rat race law profession, you work 24 hours a day, [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1436">She wants a job where she can take her time, she can work out, you know, she’s -- she’s single, she’s in her 30’s, and she wants to enjoy life, and go on vacation.</span> <span id="s1437">So, she got a job now with -- she jus -- she graduated -- you know, she -- for a few years she worked and then she went to law school, after college.</span> <span id="s1438">So she just got -- a few years ago, she got her Maine -- New Hampshire, sh -- well, she clerked for a co -- for a judge in New Hampshire.</span> <span id="s1439">So she got the New Hampshire -- she passed the New Hampshire Bar, Maine Bar and Massachusetts Bar.</span> <span id="s1440">And she works now for a investment firm, Fidelity -- Fidelity Investment, you know, it’s one of the largest in the world and she worked there, you know, in the law department.</span> <span id="s1441">She was -- it was legal [indecipherable] legal.</span> <span id="s1442">So she -- when I got the program, the program like this, cost me about 30 dollars.</span> <span id="s1443">I -- I was -- I -- I was the first accountant in Maine to use a -- to use a computer for tax returns, 30 years ago.</span> <span id="s1444">I paid for a computer, 25,000 dollars.</span> <span id="s1445">Now you buy it for 2,000.</span> <span id="s1446">Besides the 25,000, I had to pay 5,000 for maintenance of the software, changing the tax -- enhancing the programs and so on.</span> <span id="s1447">And five for the hardware.</span> <span id="s1448">Something goes wrong, which it went a lot, now it -- now it’s already no problem, but it was as big as -- twice the size of this table.</span> <span id="s1449">And it made a noise like it was, you know, it had a -- the first printer was like the ball printer, the IBM typewriters had.</span> <span id="s1450">Now, of course, you buy a computer for -- for 2,000 dollars, it has everything.</span> <span id="s1451">And you buy a program, a tax program, which has 29 states beside the federal, for 30 dollars.</span> <span id="s1452">And you don’t even need forms, they -- it prints on plain paper.</span> <span id="s1453">Rochelle used to come and to help me, she used to collate the forms and they were with -- with carbon.</span> <span id="s1454">You’d get -- all of a sudden, you start mixing up, you know, [indecipherable] paper over the carbon, or the printout are wrong.</span> <span id="s1455">So, anyway, she -- so, sh-she took her -- her aunts, you know, my -- my sister-in-law’s aunt, she put her through -- from my handwritten, and put it through their computer.</span> <span id="s1456">So I told them I’ll get a computer myself, you know, not just [indecipherable] don’t do much, just my family.</span> <span id="s1457">Says I -- I’ll get a computer and so, this coming year, I will print you out a computer on my computer, you won’t have to -- so, he sends me a check for 3,000 dollars, to -- to pay for the computer.</span> <span id="s1458">I said, “What do you have?</span> <span id="s1459">I -- I don’t want you to pay for my com --” We-Well, she died, the son died, she says, she would want you to have some of her money.</span> <span id="s1460">I says, “I don’t think it’s [indecipherable] to leave it for your children.”</span> <span id="s1461">So I -- I couldn’t -- couldn’t help it, so I took the check, you know, I -- but I didn’t deposit it.</span> <span id="s1462">I came home, I tore out the signature and I have it to keep.</span> <span id="s1463">He calls me up, “I got my statement, didn’t get my check,” he says.</span> <span id="s1464">“I’m going to write you a letter, the minute I can learn how to type.”</span> <span id="s1465">I’m teaching my computer to read my dic -- you know, type my dictation, cause I -- I don’t -- I type [indecipherable] finger here.</span> <span id="s1466">It’s very, very slow.</span> <span id="s1467">I -- I use it for e-mail, you know, I still type.</span> <span id="s1468">But I have to wait.</span> <span id="s1469">Wh-When we go to Florida, we’ll have time to train the computer to recognize my voice and -- and type.</span> <span id="s1470">So I have a difficult time with he -- with him.</span> <span id="s1471">He’s very generous.</span> <span id="s1472">And he -- I can -- I cannot fight with him.</span> <span id="s1473">[indecipherable] is not a fighter, actually, but -- so I -- I have to write him a letter.</span> <span id="s1474">Explain to him I don’t want any -- any money matters between us.</span> <span id="s1475">W-We are very devoted to each other as we -- we -- we -- as much as we see -- we can see each other.</span> <span id="s1476">We have problem [indecipherable] so -- so, when he comes here, because Rochelle makes -- usually she makes dinner and sometimes when we go out of course, I have a good excuse.</span> <span id="s1477">You are my guest, so I pay.</span> <span id="s1478">But he come there [indecipherable], he was in Florida and came to us for a week the first time, because her aunt used to be sick, she too-took care of her mo -- better than a daughter.</span> <span id="s1479">Was very, very sick, she wa -- survived Auschwitz and Rochelle -- that’s how Rochelle met her.</span> <span id="s1480">She went to see a friend of hers in the hospital and she met her own -- my -- my sister-in-law’s aunt.</span> <span id="s1481">We became friends.</span> <span id="s1482">So you can imagine, after the war, she was so sick that they carried her.</span> <span id="s1483">She weighed about 50 pounds.</span> <span id="s1484">Nobody expected she survived.</span> <span id="s1485">But she survived, she married, couldn’t have any children.</span> <span id="s1486">And he died, she’s -- was my age.</span> <span id="s1487">She just died a few months ago.</span> <span id="s1488">So, we are getting along fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">Q: Where does he live?</span> <span id="s1490">Where does your brother --</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">A: He lives in Boston, he’s retired now.</span> <span id="s1492">And so, he went to Israel in 1973, just couldn’t acclimate himself there, couldn’t get a job.</span> <span id="s1493">Came back to -- the kids didn’t like it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">Q: Did you continue to have interest in -- in going to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">A: Who?</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">Q: You.</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">A: Well, I -- I thought to -- about it, but at that time I was 50 years old already and it was -- I’m glad I didn’t, because [indecipherable] a hard time to get [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1498">If I would have come there originally, just like anybody else, I would have adapted myself to this life.</span> <span id="s1499">Now I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1500">My daughter did, though.</span> <span id="s1501">She -- I am amazed.</span> <span id="s1502">When she left for Israel, we gave her six months.</span> <span id="s1503">We thought, six months, she’ll come back, because she lived very well, she had -- the first year in college, she was in a dorm, and then she got an apartment, with a few other girls.</span> <span id="s1504">She come from a -- junior year, she had a car and then -- and the car was -- and when she used to call up and she says -- says to my wife, she said, “Let me talk to daddy,” she knew what -- she need some money.</span> <span id="s1505">So, after she graduated, she didn’t know what -- so she wanted to go to a graduate school.</span> <span id="s1506">She was considering either law or journalism.</span> <span id="s1507">And then she decided she will go to Israel and see what’s going on.</span> <span id="s1508">They were looking for teachers and social workers -- English teachers.</span> <span id="s1509">And she had a teaching certificate from Brandeis.</span> <span id="s1510">That’s all she had.</span> <span id="s1511">And she went there, started teaching and she hated.</span> <span id="s1512">For a year, she was in absorption center, learning the language.</span> <span id="s1513">And she went to Brandeis, which is a Jewish college, which had the best Judaica courses in the -- in the United States, and she didn’t take a single one.</span> <span id="s1514">Not the language, Hebrew, not a -- no Bible, no anything, nothing.</span> <span id="s1515">And then she comes there and she gets a job and she says, “I wish I would listen to my father.”</span> <span id="s1516">Too late.</span> <span id="s1517">But she speaks Hebrew now, fluently.</span> <span id="s1518">She works with immigrants -- English speaking immigrants, mostly.</span> <span id="s1519">And Israelis, with the -- she’s a representative to the Ministry of the Interior in the town, in the city hall.</span> <span id="s1520">So some maybe say a -- a passport, that’s her job.</span> <span id="s1521">Someone has a problem, you know, with the Ministry of the Interior, or immigrants, especially, especially, so-called Anglo-Saxon, you know, English speaking, which have a difficult time to learn Hebrew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">Q: So she took after you in the work that she does.</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">A: Yeah, yeah, she [inaudible].</span> <span id="s1524">A low salary, but she’s [indecipherable] and she married a man who’s Iranian, entirely different backgrounds, different -- but the family -- his family th-think that she is God, she -- that she -- she knows everything.</span> <span id="s1525">They’re very plain people, hardly speak Hebrew, but they have to get -- get along.</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">Q: Is he an Iranian Jew, or is he non-Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1527">A: Iranian Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">Q: How have your feelings about religion changed over the years?</span> <span id="s1529">Did you have a strong sense of faith before the Holocaust and did it change after the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">A: I had -- Well, I was never religious, but I had religious background, I knew about religion, I knew the Bible backward and forward.</span> <span id="s1531">And I learned it since I was three years old, I knew it.</span> <span id="s1532">I always had a kind of a -- I don’t know how to describe my relationship with religion.</span> <span id="s1533">It’s -- It’s -- Rochelle has a hate - love, mostly hate.</span> <span id="s1534">We -- We have problem when I discuss it with her, I say, “All right, G-God, if he did do the Holocaust, you know, if G-God did the Holocaust, all right, I can understand your hating him.</span> <span id="s1535">But at the same time, you agree that He exists.</span> <span id="s1536">He or She or whatever It is.</span> <span id="s1537">Because you cannot be -- be mad at something that doesn’t exist, can you?”</span> <span id="s1538">I partic -- I -- I was active here in every facet of Jewish life in Portland except religious institutions.</span> <span id="s1539">I belonged to a Temple, but I was several times elected to the board, I did not accept it.</span> <span id="s1540">I did not -- I was of the opinion, if you are a leader in a religious organization, you have to at least have set some example of -- of religious practice.</span> <span id="s1541">And I could not do that.</span> <span id="s1542">I consider religion -- Jewish religion as part of Jewish culture.</span> <span id="s1543">It is in our past.</span> <span id="s1544">Is there a God or isn’t a God?</span> <span id="s1545">I cannot determine.</span> <span id="s1546">I -- I think by my philosophy, I’m agnostic.</span> <span id="s1547">But I cannot deny -- that means I cannot deny there isn’t one, nor can there is one.</span> <span id="s1548">But, the-these tr -- the trappings of religion do exist in our culture.</span> <span id="s1549">This ha -- This is part of our inheritance.</span> <span id="s1550">We do go on high holidays.</span> <span id="s1551">I go, when I have chance, practically every Saturday here, when I’m in Portland.</span> <span id="s1552">And in Florida, there is a big synagogue and you don’t just -- there -- you’re not welcome, as a -- as a snowbird, w-we are snowbirds.</span> <span id="s1553">That’s people that stay for the season.</span> <span id="s1554">They accept membership, you know, for a low fee.</span> <span id="s1555">Membership are very high there, but for a low fee, for the few months you are there, but they -- you never get -- you-you’re a second class member.</span> <span id="s1556">So we -- I don’t -- didn’t join.</span> <span id="s1557">Once in awhile we go, they had cultural events in the synagogue, shows and concerts, we go there.</span> <span id="s1558">But that’s about it.</span> <span id="s1559">Again, to put it in a nutshell, religion is part of our inheritance.</span> <span id="s1560">I don’t think we are ready to give it up yet.</span> <span id="s1561">The idea would be, if there was one religion, one world religion, where they recognize one force, call it God, call it whatever you want to, a non-sectarian.</span> <span id="s1562">Will it ever be?</span> <span id="s1563">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1564">The Soviet Union tried to suppress religion for 70 years and they did not succeed.</span> <span id="s1565">It is strong, it’s alive and people need it in their lives.</span> <span id="s1566">I never prayed.</span> <span id="s1567">If I do pray, I pray for national or global salvation.</span> <span id="s1568">Peace.</span> <span id="s1569">Very important to me.</span> <span id="s1570">Never -- I never prayed God for myself, help me get a good job, or -- I don’t think this power, which we call God, is designed for individual concern.</span> <span id="s1571">I envy people that can have a personal religion.</span> <span id="s1572">This is my God, I pray, you know, and He answers me.</span> <span id="s1573">If they have it, more power to them.</span> <span id="s1574">I cannot do that.</span> <span id="s1575">I see, when I did the prayers, you know, that we say on the high holidays, it’s poetry.</span> <span id="s1576">The adulation of a power which we call God, see?</span> <span id="s1577">I can’t understand why do we have to bless God?</span> <span id="s1578">This a power -- a omnipotent power that blesses us, right?</span> <span id="s1579">So what -- what does my little blessing -- you know, we say a blessing, in Jewish life, there are lots of blessings, you know, that -- that 613, it’s what?</span> <span id="s1580">Commandments.</span> <span id="s1581">We have -- whatever you do, you make a blessing.</span> <span id="s1582">Blessed are thou, you know [indecipherable] brought forth from the soil.</span> <span id="s1583">But you have to bring it yourself from the soil.</span> <span id="s1584">Gives you th-the -- the tools of doing it, see?</span> <span id="s1585">So, i-if it’s a blessing, I have to ask for a blessing.</span> <span id="s1586">So I don’t think I’m more important a creature, as a ment, or any other creature.</span> <span id="s1587">So, I have -- I -- I think I’m in that class by myself.</span> <span id="s1588">I don’t think anybody has the same -- everybody has his own -- his own belief, his own bi -- philosophy.</span> <span id="s1589">I don’t think -- I’m sure that others have their own, other kinds of philosophies or -- or beliefs, or whatever and they think that theirs is right.</span> <span id="s1590">But I -- I would like to see if there’s a relationship -- if there has -- a religion has to exist, let there be one.</span> <span id="s1591">We -- We consider ourselves the chosen people.</span> <span id="s1592">Of course, they say we -- we were chosen to teach other peoples, but we taught enough -- yeah, we can taught enough.</span> <span id="s1593">We -- Everybody knows the Christian Right knows the Bible backward and forward, you know, and they use it just for their needs, just what they want.</span> <span id="s1594">They, you know, they quote.</span> <span id="s1595">But the other thing, the good things are there, which they do not.</span> <span id="s1596">So, until -- now, you see, you take the Muslim world.</span> <span id="s1597">Religion is upswing in the Muslim, Jewish and Christian.</span> <span id="s1598">The same even with India, which was a very tolerant -- you know, the Hindu, mostly Hindu, we’ll talk about the -- what do you call it?</span> <span id="s1599">Eastern religions --</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">Q: Buddhists?</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">A: Buddim -- Buddhism and the -- the Hindu I think was th-the most liberal one.</span> <span id="s1602">They tolerated other religions.</span> <span id="s1603">But they -- Now they -- they -- they developed atomic bomb into the Hindu bomb.</span> <span id="s1604">The -- Pak-Pakistan developed a atomic bomb and it is the Muslim, Islamic bomb.</span> <span id="s1605">So Israel will have a Jewish bomb and Russia has a Russian bomb and we start bringing in religion into politics.</span> <span id="s1606">The greatest -- The greatest danger to the world is when we come on behalf, we c -- we represent God.</span> <span id="s1607">[indecipherable] my God, you know.</span> <span id="s1608">The Germans had on their buckles of the -- the belts, God metoons, God is with us.</span> <span id="s1609">The Czars had the same thing in Russian, see?</span> <span id="s1610">So, th-this is the -- the greatest danger is when religion -- when somebody thinks that he represents the right religion and the others -- oth-others do not.</span> <span id="s1611">So, unless it is a -- a global religion, one that recognizes the right of man, human beings, man [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1612">We have now a rabbi, a woman rabbi and they go and hire a woman cantor.</span> <span id="s1613">And some women don’t like two women on the pulpit -- on the, you know, stage there.</span> <span id="s1614">Women.</span> <span id="s1615">What’s the difference it make if you -- if you have the same rights, why not?</span> <span id="s1616">They are -- They’re more than 50 percent of population now are women.</span> <span id="s1617">The most important people in my life are women.</span> <span id="s1618">I have a wife.</span> <span id="s1619">I have two daughters, I have three granddaughters and three grandsons.</span> <span id="s1620">So I hope I -- I hope I -- y-you get the gist of what I am talking about, because I myself don’t get it too clear.</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">Q: I have just one more question I think, and then if you want to add anything, but it -- do you think you can sum up, or explain something about how the -- your experiences living through the Holocaust in the wartime years ha-has affected your outlook on life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">A: Oh, it affected me greatly.</span> <span id="s1623">I -- I -- I lived through unusual times, unusual periods of history.</span> <span id="s1624">I lived -- Don’t forget, I was born in a -- during the first World War, that’s 83 years ago.</span> <span id="s1625">There was no electricity in the town I lived, til the day I left it.</span> <span id="s1626">There was one for -- in the flour mill, it had electricity just for the -- for the -- for one house in the -- the -- in the mill.</span> <span id="s1627">And I came fr-from -- from the wagon, you know, horse and wagon -- horse and buggy, from the railroad -- from the -- the invention of electricity to space travel.</span> <span id="s1628">They were all during my lifetime.</span> <span id="s1629">Telephone, which I don’t understand eve -- still, how it works, see -- was invented by the time why I was born.</span> <span id="s1630">I am operating a computer and I can get into a network which has -- I’m trying to find one -- one subject, Yiddish, a language of a people which is gone, almost a dead language.</span> <span id="s1631">It’s trying to be revived by non-Jews studying it.</span> <span id="s1632">And -- And there’s 590 pages on the computer about Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1633">There’s thousands of thousands and thousands of pages about science an-and then things which in my little laptop -- so, I am a product of a -- probably that covered a civilization which did not change from the fifte -- 1500’s to the 2,000’s.</span> <span id="s1634">In the span of my lifetime, these things happened.</span> <span id="s1635">I used to go from -- with the wagon of bu -- a horse and buggy from Povorsk, from my -- the town where they lived, to Koven, to buy merchandise, which is three -- 33 kilometers.</span> <span id="s1636">Seven -- 16 miles, all night.</span> <span id="s1637">Course, there were no paved roads, it was sand, it was very difficult to get there.</span> <span id="s1638">I go now to Israel, 6,000 miles, in the same time, by plane.</span> <span id="s1639">So, and -- and I still cannot digest it, I cannot understand it.</span> <span id="s1640">And I find that the -- the human race is way ahead in it’s technology, but way behind in it’s conception of life, all together.</span> <span id="s1641">I think, if you made this much progress, i-if you could have made this much progress in -- in our lifes with each other, the people’s, countries, the systems, religions, if you could find a way to regulate our lifes to the same measuring stick as the technology went, we should be wonderful and be -- be able to get along fine.</span> <span id="s1642">And it’s getting worse.</span> <span id="s1643">That’s what bothers me.</span> <span id="s1644">I am worried that my grandchildren will run out of food by the time they’re grown up.</span> <span id="s1645">And I know what it means being hungry.</span> <span id="s1646">I wouldn’t wish it on anybody.</span> <span id="s1647">An-And the same time, you think -- yo-you don’t see them, so you don’t think of them, but the way I do think of it.</span> <span id="s1648">There are millions of peop -- children every day, die from hunger -- starvation.</span> <span id="s1649">Every day in the world.</span> <span id="s1650">Some are worried that they got too many people being born.</span> <span id="s1651">And the same time, the same people are dying every day.</span> <span id="s1652">And -- And I -- I am worried about what -- what will happen, you know, with the developed countries and undeveloped countries.</span> <span id="s1653">You can see now people coming into the United States, you cannot stop that.</span> <span id="s1654">You know, from other cultures.</span> <span id="s1655">But not so much culture, they come from the next door, from Mexico, who cannot --no living there.</span> <span id="s1656">And th-the world is getting so small.</span> <span id="s1657">And -- And the -- the means of destruction are getting so awesome, that who knows what will happen?</span> <span id="s1658">I am worried, worried.</span> <span id="s1659">And I think something should be done.</span> <span id="s1660">Course I [indecipherable] one person cannot do much.</span> <span id="s1661">I wish I had the -- the gift of writing -- perhaps write a book about it, what -- what bothers me.</span> <span id="s1662">But I don’t -- This doesn’t answer you question actually, does it?</span> <span id="s1663">Your questions of what did I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">Q: It starts to.</span> <span id="s1665">[indecipherable] H-How --</span></p> <p><span id="s1666">A: I -- I cannot give you an answer and I ca -- I -- I can -- I can raise a lot of questions on your question.</span> <span id="s1667">But how to solve it, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1668">There is sitting now a group of people in -- in -- in Washington, the same race, believers of one God.</span> <span id="s1669">They have wa -- wa -- one prophet more than we have, see, and -- and they cannot get along.</span> <span id="s1670">Similar [indecipherable], similar languages.</span> <span id="s1671">Same race.</span> <span id="s1672">Same race.</span> <span id="s1673">And we can’t find the way to -- to settle their differences.</span> <span id="s1674">And again, is it because it’s my God is -- is the true God and I -- the -- the -- there’s a -- there’s a -- a little mountain and -- and a hill in Jerusalem, where the Jewish Temple stood.</span> <span id="s1675">And there are Jews that want to build another Temple.</span> <span id="s1676">But we have been away from there a thousand years -- 2,000 years, and they built another sanctuary there.</span> <span id="s1677">Why can’t people live side by side?</span> <span id="s1678">It -- It worries me a great deal.</span> <span id="s1679">Now, of course, I have no -- I have no worries about making a living, even though I have nightmares.</span> <span id="s1680">I have very strange nightmares.</span> <span id="s1681">I -- I -- I -- I don’t have -- I don’t know where my next meal is coming from.</span> <span id="s1682">I’m hungry and I haven’t got a few dollars to buy myself a loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s1683">Which -- It happened during my lifetime.</span> <span id="s1684">And I -- And I get up, you know, it wakes me up and I really thank God that I ha -- I have -- the refrigerator’s full.</span> <span id="s1685">And I have, you know, what to live on.</span> <span id="s1686">And so that the -- the -- the -- the threat is gone.</span> <span id="s1687">But I fall asleep and the same -- the same would continue.</span></p> <p><span id="s1688">End of Tape Three, Side B Beginning of Tape Four, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">A: [indecipherable] convey [indecipherable] my feelings.</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">Q: Yeah, yeah, I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1691">A: [inaudible] Maybe I’m incoherent, but I am trying to -- to tell you what worries me about the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">Q: It -- It makes -- It makes sense.</span> <span id="s1693">I mean it’s -- it’s not anything that it -- that really makes -- that you can make sense of, but I think you’re --</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">A: It’s getting even more complicated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">Q: Do you have anything else you want to say?</span></p> <p><span id="s1696">A: Well, I think it was a good idea to interview us, or -- or other survivors, about the time from liberation, or our arrival in this country.</span> <span id="s1697">It’s very important, what you could make of yourself.</span> <span id="s1698">Most of us did well, even though we had to pick up pieces and start from the beginning.</span> <span id="s1699">New country, new language, new customs, new modes of behavior, everything’s new.</span> <span id="s1700">We stepped into it and somehow we did it.</span> <span id="s1701">I think what the driving force behind it, it was kind of a rev-revenge.</span> <span id="s1702">Revenge of Hitler.</span> <span id="s1703">And -- And when I -- when I see my grandchildren, I feel it.</span> <span id="s1704">It’s -- I have two groups of grandchildren, growing up in different cultures.</span> <span id="s1705">I’m trying to keep them together, I’m trying to -- to have them see each other as often as they can and to retain the relationship, even though they’re different backgrounds and different ideas, trying to accomplish it.</span> <span id="s1706">I hope they remember me for it.</span> <span id="s1707">Now for my sake, it doesn’t matter, when I am gone, that’s it.</span> <span id="s1708">But, I might be the common denominator for them.</span> <span id="s1709">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1710">Q: That’s interesting to hear you say you think that a lot of the success of the survivors in the United States has been motivated by that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1711">A: Consciously or subconsciously, but it was a part of it.</span> <span id="s1712">Could -- a lot -- we accomplished a lot -- some born Americans did -- could not accomplish, who had all the advantages of language and upbringing and education and we -- we did it.</span> <span id="s1713">We did it, so -- well, the majority.</span> <span id="s1714">There are a lot of people that are sick and poor among survivors.</span> <span id="s1715">I hope they get the money from -- from sw -- from Switzerland now, so they can live their few -- their last few years in comfort.</span> <span id="s1716">But there are some.</span> <span id="s1717">But the majority I think did all right, economically.</span> <span id="s1718">Some countries, [indecipherable] that.</span> <span id="s1719">We didn’t.</span> <span id="s1720">We -- We worried about our children, we wanted them to be -- grow up as good human beings.</span> <span id="s1721">I think, in a way, we succeeded.</span> <span id="s1722">They -- Many think they couldn’t understand us, see?</span> <span id="s1723">They couldn’t, but the older they get, the smarter we look to them.</span> <span id="s1724">They finally realized that the-there was -- there was not wasted.</span> <span id="s1725">Was not wasted, they know.</span> <span id="s1726">And this is the most important -- the most important things in our lives are -- are the children and grandchildren.</span> <span id="s1727">We hope they retain being Jewish, not because we are better than other people, but we are -- we are the endangered species.</span> <span id="s1728">I would like it to survive.</span> <span id="s1729">We contributed a lot to the world as Jews.</span> <span id="s1730">So, let us exist as Jews.</span> <span id="s1731">Again, not because we are better, I hope ev-every -- every people have -- can contribute something.</span> <span id="s1732">That’s why they got rid of, you know, this melting pot, it didn’t work, even though, up to an extent it did work.</span> <span id="s1733">But I think it’s -- they -- it is a -- diversity is very important.</span> <span id="s1734">Everybody can contribute something to life in the -- the -- America -- America itself is a concept that did not exist til -- til -- til America.</span> <span id="s1735">A country of immigrants.</span> <span id="s1736">A country where everybody contributed something, good or bad, both.</span> <span id="s1737">A country where th-the patriotism is not just religious like in theocracies which exist in this world.</span> <span id="s1738">A country where you can love just for -- for being America.</span> <span id="s1739">What -- For the freedom, for the opportunity.</span> <span id="s1740">A lot to be done.</span> <span id="s1741">A lot yet to be done.</span> <span id="s1742">It worries me that the -- the Black belligerence, Farrakhan, the Muslim.</span> <span id="s1743">Not -- Not because the -- ma -- Islam -- the nation of Islam, the Muslim religion.</span> <span id="s1744">Fine, if they want to believe -- whatever they want to believe, but not to be the -- there’s still a big problem for them to be integrated into this society, into the econ-conomy.</span> <span id="s1745">Though, a lot of them did already.</span> <span id="s1746">I hope they succeed more.</span> <span id="s1747">Otherwise -- Otherwise, there will be a race war here.</span> <span id="s1748">This’ll be very dangerous.</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">Q: Were you following the -- that -- those issues closely, in the 60’s, when the Civil Rights movement was happening and -- and the controversies --</span></p> <p><span id="s1750">A: Oh, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1751">Q: -- about segregation and integration?</span></p> <p><span id="s1752">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1753">Q: What were your feelings about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1754">A: Well, I -- I -- I -- I’m all for it.</span> <span id="s1755">I’m all for it.</span> <span id="s1756">I was -- I -- Many times I could not understand.</span> <span id="s1757">Like, for instance, the Vietnamese war.</span> <span id="s1758">The Vietnamese war.</span> <span id="s1759">I was for victory in Vietnam, because of Communism.</span> <span id="s1760">But this was entirely different, cause it’s not Soviet Communism.</span> <span id="s1761">It is a nationalism.</span> <span id="s1762">They fought for -- They fought for the Vietnam, not for Communist [indecipherable], it was Vietnam they wanted.</span> <span id="s1763">Their own -- Their own tradition, their own -- th-the fact that -- what was his name, the leader of -- my memory’s getting bad -- the founder of Vietnamese -- the North Vietnam [indecipherable] name.</span> <span id="s1764">You know, the President of North Vietnam, he adopted Communism.</span> <span id="s1765">But -- But the Communism, the -- the co -- Soviet Communism collapsed.</span> <span id="s1766">-- such a strong dictatorship, it collapsed.</span> <span id="s1767">So you see, you cannot rule by force alone.</span> <span id="s1768">It’s impossible.</span> <span id="s1769">People have to love their country and to love the -- and this regime, that was not loved and it had to collapse.</span> <span id="s1770">So, I had many, you know, misconceptions, but as far as Blacks are concerned or integration [indecipherable], this has to be -- has to be achieved.</span> <span id="s1771">Has to be achieved.</span></p> <p><span id="s1772">Q: [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s1773">A: No, I think -- I think I gave you my -- I -- I believe in America.</span> <span id="s1774">I believe in the -- I think this is a society which will -- it is still being developed, not -- there are many, many bad things, which have to be straightened out.</span> <span id="s1775">I hope we understand [indecipherable] because our leaders understand it.</span> <span id="s1776">I hope all the generations younger than I am, you know, could -- we -- I think we on the right track.</span> <span id="s1777">I think it ta-take some time.</span> <span id="s1778">Hopefully it will be a -- it will be a -- some example -- exemplary society, America.</span> <span id="s1779">We have the resources and we have the -- the -- the conditions.</span> <span id="s1780">We have the historical conditions and we have the human condition, the k-kind of people we have now.</span> <span id="s1781">And we have a great future, provided we don’t spoil it ourselves.</span> <span id="s1782">The most important thing is to integrate the Black population, which is 10 percent, that’s a large percentage.</span> <span id="s1783">Try to inter -- into the economy first.</span> <span id="s1784">Later on, in the way of thinking, in the philosophy of this country, country of minorities, cause there’s no majority left.</span> <span id="s1785">There’s no single group in the United States that is a majority, except by religion, maybe.</span> <span id="s1786">Chr-Christian, the Christian religion, because they will dominate -- but I mean, the split -- the split, you know, there’s Catholics and Protestant.</span> <span id="s1787">Many, many different kinds of [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1788">An-And if they -- they succeed in think-thinking this is a Christian country or a Protestant country or a Catholic country, it’ll be a big mistake.</span> <span id="s1789">We are -- We have to create a new kind of patriotism.</span> <span id="s1790">Patriotism for America, for -- for -- for human -- human beings, for human rights.</span> <span id="s1791">And first of all, we have to fix our -- our own -- our own place here, our own country.</span></p> <p><span id="s1792">Q: Thank you very much.</span> <span id="s1793">This concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Jerry
