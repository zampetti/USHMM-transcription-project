Interviews: January 25, 1979</span></p> <p><span id="s3">A: I was born in Berlin Germany April 23, 1927 and I was youngest child.</span> <span id="s4">I had one older sister, seven years older and my parents were middle class people.</span> <span id="s5">Both of my grandfathers were pretty well off.</span> <span id="s6">They were both self employed.</span> <span id="s7">It was the time when you worked and wanted to get somewhere you could get where you could accomplish something.</span> <span id="s8">They operated stores and they were pretty well educated and worked very hard.</span> <span id="s9">I never met my mother’s father.</span> <span id="s10">I met my father’s father and I knew he was what you call in German a tailor master.</span> <span id="s11">It took nine years to become a tailor master.</span> <span id="s12">Then you could have your own business, which he had in an apartment building.</span> <span id="s13">He spoke French, English and German and was rather strict.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">My father was the youngest of the three sons he had, and his wife died rather early.</span> <span id="s15">My father was a typical young German Jew of his age.</span> <span id="s16">He was in the military, at first he was educated in what you call the gymnasium, not as an officer but for the people who were more educated.</span> <span id="s17">He had a rather good time, they all did, the three brothers and they all served as very proud Germans.</span> <span id="s18">They were good Jews.</span> <span id="s19">They were what you call here, maybe, conservative.</span> <span id="s20">They did keep kosher at home, but since their mother had died, things were not observed that strictly.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: But they did attend the synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: Oh, my grandfather was kind of a big wheel at the synagogue and it was very important to him that he had his name in the records.</span> <span id="s23">He was a very aware Jew and that was the thing in Germany and Berlin, anyway the southern part of Berlin.</span> <span id="s24">My family comes, not only my grandfather, but my great grandfather comes from there.</span> <span id="s25">They were a really old family and were very well thought of by the people who very much accepted the Jews.</span> <span id="s26">On the High Holy Days, everybody went with a top hat and morning coat and striped trousers and their prayer books and everybody wished them happy holiday and happy new year.</span> <span id="s27">They were accepted.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: And you lived then in a neighborhood that was not primarily Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: No.</span> <span id="s30">We didn’t have that sort of thing except in the part of Berlin which mostly contained very Orthodox Jews.</span> <span id="s31">These Jews came mainly from Poland.</span> <span id="s32">This was like a little ghetto so to speak, but the rest of the population lived in segregated sections.</span> <span id="s33">But, anyway, my father and mother got married and my mother is from South Germany, from Darmstadt and from about the same background as my father, as was customary.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Well, it was kind of an arranged marriage like they used to do.</span> <span id="s35">Both of my sets of grandparents went for a vacation to the sea and they met and found out one had four daughters and the other had three sons.</span> <span id="s36">My maternal grandfather had a business selling women’s clothes and such.</span> <span id="s37">He owned the building where it was.</span> <span id="s38">My other grandfather sold men’s clothing in Berlin.</span> <span id="s39">He came to Berlin to do the buying and took a daughter along.</span> <span id="s40">Different daughters met different sons and my parents met.</span> <span id="s41">My mother didn’t want to get married, but I guess she finally broke down and thought well, all right.</span> <span id="s42">She met him and they corresponded.</span> <span id="s43">Then they got engaged.</span> <span id="s44">She never even knew how old he was.</span> <span id="s45">But, in those days she was about twenty-six and practically an old maid and she turned down everybody, so she finally said OK.</span> <span id="s46">They got married in February 1914.</span> <span id="s47">My mother was not in love.</span> <span id="s48">She was never very happy.</span> <span id="s49">It was such a very different way of life.</span> <span id="s50">July my father had to go to do active duty, since he had been in the military, he had to go once a year and serve for a month, like here in the National Guard.</span> <span id="s51">July he went for his full time and the war broke out and he never came back for four years.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: Your mother was pregnant?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: She was pregnant, of course.</span> <span id="s54">He came home when the baby was about a year old.</span> <span id="s55">He came home on a leave and left my mother pregnant again.</span> <span id="s56">Then he didn’t come home until the end of the war.</span> <span id="s57">The second child died during the war when he was a year old because he had problems.</span> <span id="s58">My mother went to South Germany to stay with her sister and then they had almost no problems compared to the last war.</span> <span id="s59">They had a little bit of air raids and such.</span> <span id="s60">The baby caught pneumonia and died.</span> <span id="s61">They didn’t have penicillin.</span> <span id="s62">So my father came back after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Back during the war my mother gave up keeping a kosher house because of problems to get the food and she was a pretty helpless person anyway.</span> <span id="s64">She was spoiled, not like you would meet here in the States.</span> <span id="s65">She was very simple and very kind and a very unworldly person, but she was brought up to run a house.</span> <span id="s66">She studied music and had been in France for a year in finishing school.</span> <span id="s67">She learned to speak French.</span> <span id="s68">She knew how to tell the girl what to cook, how to set the table, to entertain, but she was very helpless when common sense came.</span> <span id="s69">She was just not able to cope very well.</span> <span id="s70">Especially being alone like that.</span> <span id="s71">She never had had to.</span> <span id="s72">She was kind of a dependent person.</span> <span id="s73">My father came back from the war and started to have a business of his own.</span> <span id="s74">He wanted to get away from his father and his two brothers.</span> <span id="s75">It wasn’t too easy anyway.</span> <span id="s76">In 1921 he decided to take another honeymoon.</span> <span id="s77">For the first they went all over, Italy, etc.</span> <span id="s78">The second they went to the North Sea and Helgoland which is a little island.</span> <span id="s79">That’s how I got my name.</span> <span id="s80">That’s how I was born, so it’s kind of an afterthought.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: It was just you and your sister, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: About ten years difference in age?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: No, seven years.</span> <span id="s85">When we grew up we didn’t have anything special, really.</span> <span id="s86">We lived in a nice apartment in a very nice building in Berlin.</span> <span id="s87">I was born right in the house where we lived.</span> <span id="s88">We had hardwood floors and the big rooms in a nice section of Berlin.</span> <span id="s89">We went to school.</span> <span id="s90">We were then conservative and a little more liberal.</span> <span id="s91">We kept up with all the Jewish holidays.</span> <span id="s92">We had friends.</span> <span id="s93">My parents didn’t have only Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s94">We did not have religious school like we do here.</span> <span id="s95">We had religion in the public school.</span> <span id="s96">Mostly the kids were Protestant and one teacher taught.</span> <span id="s97">We had two Catholic girls, so they had a priest come in and we had about ten Jewish kids.</span> <span id="s98">In elementary school we had a lady come in.</span> <span id="s99">She was terrible as a teacher.</span> <span id="s100">We went to Temple on the High Holy Days and my grandfather went every Friday night.</span> <span id="s101">My sister and I had to visit my grandfather.</span> <span id="s102">He had remarried then and we weren’t too fond of her.</span> <span id="s103">We went Friday nights, had to go, didn’t want to go because he wasn’t exactly the friendliest of people.</span> <span id="s104">He gave us a blessing, religiously, it was sign of love.</span> <span id="s105">We loved the High Holy Days.</span> <span id="s106">Like I said everybody, just everybody knew about it.</span> <span id="s107">Everybody put on their best clothes and just went around, showing everybody how well off you were.</span> <span id="s108">You’d dress up and dress up the kids.</span> <span id="s109">The kids carried on a lot, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">We had dinner on Passover, everything was at our house because we were the only kids in the family.</span> <span id="s111">My older uncle, the one I was closest to, my father’s middle brother, he didn’t get married until later.</span> <span id="s112">He was living with a German woman.</span> <span id="s113">She was from the wrong side of the tracks.</span> <span id="s114">My oldest uncle had married a lady who was older than him, she couldn’t have any kids, so they were always at our house.</span> <span id="s115">I remember Passover dinners when you drink a lot of wine, I don’t know if you’re familiar with that, but it’s a big thing that you have to drink four glasses.</span> <span id="s116">Of course we got to drink a little bit of wine, but still we fell asleep on the floor before the whole thing was over.</span> <span id="s117">I guess we were rather spoiled.</span> <span id="s118">I was spoiled because I was the youngest and there were only two kids there.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">We did go to my grandmother in Darmstadt once a year.</span> <span id="s120">Vacation time we had four weeks summer vacation, we did spend it there.</span> <span id="s121">I didn’t like it there.</span> <span id="s122">She was very strict and she thought we were very spoiled.</span> <span id="s123">She had money, but she was very tight.</span> <span id="s124">To eat butter and jam on bread, that was already a sin.</span> <span id="s125">Don’t waste it, and she still kept strictly kosher.</span> <span id="s126">She disapproved very much of our non-kosher home.</span> <span id="s127">She’d ask, we were just little kids, “What do you want for dinner?”</span> <span id="s128">I’d say, “Ham sandwich.”</span> <span id="s129">She’d just say, “Ahh!</span> <span id="s130">!</span> <span id="s131">Ahh!</span> <span id="s132">!</span> <span id="s133">Gatz!”</span> <span id="s134">We were pretty happy generally.</span> <span id="s135">I had, especially, one little girl friend that was my very best friend from the first day of school.</span> <span id="s136">She lived on the same street I lived, just about a block up.</span> <span id="s137">We walked to school together, came home together, stayed at each other house.</span> <span id="s138">I went to her’s on Christmas, she came over on Hannukah.</span> <span id="s139">You know it was really a very close relationship.</span> <span id="s140">She was a very cute little girl, all around nice.</span> <span id="s141">Then, of course, in 1933, it started.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: Were you still in school at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: Oh yes, sure!</span> <span id="s144">I was about eleven years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: It is hard to realize how old people are.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: Yes, we heard my parents talk.</span> <span id="s147">We didn’t pay much attention, but of course we heard that there were elections.</span> <span id="s148">One day my sister and I walked home from school.</span> <span id="s149">Of course we didn’t stay home from school, but I remember my father coming home that night from business.</span> <span id="s150">He was ordinarily very calm and he was a very smart man.</span> <span id="s151">He was generally very well liked.</span> <span id="s152">He was talking about the SA (Schutz-Abteilung, these were the “Brown Shirts” i.e. the general type of uniformed Hitler party people) on the subway and collecting money to buy “knives for the Jews.”</span> <span id="s153">This was the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: Before that you really hadn’t felt anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s156">Really and truly not one thing.</span> <span id="s157">Of course, maybe a lot of other Jewish people told us how we were too assimilated into German society.</span> <span id="s158">We were very proud that my father served in the war, in spite of the fact that he probably would not have had to go because his hearing was bad.</span> <span id="s159">He had been decorated with the Iron Cross (one of the highest decoration a combatant could receive for acts in the war).</span> <span id="s160">It had been in the paper, since it was a big thing.</span> <span id="s161">The religion was in the background as compared to anything like that, that had never been involved.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Of course, as I said, the religion was not so much except for the people who lived in the ghetto and who spoke Yiddish, which we did not understand.</span> <span id="s163">(Yiddish was a language, written in Hebrew characters, with words derived mainly from German, but also from local dialects and Polish and other languages which had been used in transactions between Jews of Eastern Europe).</span> <span id="s164">We did learn Hebrew in school and used it in our prayers, but we did not know Yiddish.</span> <span id="s165">We did not have any special language or anything like that.</span> <span id="s166">(Living in the ghetto was a different life).</span> <span id="s167">They (the Jews from the ghetto) went around and wore their own clothing.</span> <span id="s168">The black coat, and the black hat and the earlocks and stuff.</span> <span id="s169">We really had nothing to do with them, we just didn’t have anything in common with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: Tell me exactly what part of town you did live in.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: We lived in West Berlin, in Charlottenburg, which is a part of Berlin.</span> <span id="s172">My grandfather had his store in Charlottenburg in one of the larger buildings.</span> <span id="s173">My father opened his own store in town, in the downtown district of Berlin proper.</span> <span id="s174">We lived outside of town.</span> <span id="s175">My grandfather lived in the old part of Charlottenburg.</span> <span id="s176">We lived in the new part of it.</span> <span id="s177">The younger people moved out, just as they do here.</span> <span id="s178">I had never in my life been subjected to anything as far as anti-Semitism went.</span> <span id="s179">I really hadn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: So when your father came home you were surprised?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: It was very much of a shock.</span> <span id="s182">I was very shocked!</span> <span id="s183">There was always some kind of feeling amongst the German people against the Jews who came from Poland and tried to live their own way of life and did not try to fit into the existing society.</span> <span id="s184">I guess that you heard about them and subconsciously, as kids you disapproved of them.</span> <span id="s185">We also disapproved, especially my mother would, after all I did describe to you the kind of person she was, showing off their wealth, dripping with minks and diamonds and such, and talking loud.</span> <span id="s186">Anything like that was to her, just a horror, she couldn’t handle that at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">It started pretty fast.</span> <span id="s188">So when it started, because I was in public school, mornings, when we used to come in -- I don’t quite remember how it was -- yes -- we didn’t move anything, we used to say “Good Morning.”</span> <span id="s189">The teacher said “Good Morning” and used to talk in typical German formal sentences -- so then we started the day by saying “Heil Hitler” and singing the “Horst Wessel song” (that is the marching song of the party of Hitler which was utilized).</span> <span id="s190">I remember my father taking my sister and me and telling us “No Heil Hitler” and you are not going to sing the “Horst Wessel song.”</span> <span id="s191">You stand up when everyone stands up, but you keep your mouth shut.</span> <span id="s192">You don’t have to (say that and sing that) this is a thing they want to do against us and we are not going to go along with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: How did the other children react?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: The children did not react at all, at first.</span> <span id="s195">The children did not!</span> <span id="s196">It came home to me through the girl friend of mine I told you about.</span> <span id="s197">Her family were very nice people.</span> <span id="s198">Her father had bad luck, he couldn’t make enough money.</span> <span id="s199">Times were bad I guess.</span> <span id="s200">Lots of people couldn’t make it.</span> <span id="s201">My father had (financial) problems, but he could fall back on my grandfather.</span> <span id="s202">These people really had problems, he couldn’t make it.</span> <span id="s203">He had four daughters and a wife who liked to live pretty good.</span> <span id="s204">The apartments were expensive.</span> <span id="s205">Everything was expensive, clothing for the kids, all that kind of stuff.</span> <span id="s206">So he was one of the first to join the (Hitler) party.</span> <span id="s207">I remember that on one occasion, the first occasion when you could fly the flag, he flew the Swastika.</span> <span id="s208">Of course, I told my parents about it.</span> <span id="s209">My father told me “Now I don’t think that he wants to interfere with your friendship.</span> <span id="s210">I think that he just wants the Jews out who don’t belong here in Germany.</span> <span id="s211">I don’t think that he means anything against you.</span> <span id="s212">He wants those out who came from Poland, from Romania to leave.</span> <span id="s213">Your father is a war veteran and your family has been here for generations.</span> <span id="s214">You have nothing to do with that.”</span> <span id="s215">He probably did believe that.</span> <span id="s216">I believe that he sincerely believed in this.</span> <span id="s217">I believe that my father did.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: So did you continue the friendship?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: We continued the friendship.</span> <span id="s220">I said that I was eleven years old in 1933 and by the time 1935 rolled around it was not possible anymore.</span> <span id="s221">My sister, this is a thing you might be interested in, was ready to graduate from high school.</span> <span id="s222">High school is different over there.</span> <span id="s223">It is a lot more important and I guess a little more advanced than here.</span> <span id="s224">Once you graduate there, you have the Abitur, which is about equal to one year of college.</span> <span id="s225">Anyway, each student had to present a thesis on a chosen subject.</span> <span id="s226">Then the students were questioned by the teachers and professors from other places.</span> <span id="s227">It was an important thing.</span> <span id="s228">My sister, of course, being seven years older, realized a lot more of what went on than I did.</span> <span id="s229">She picked a subject which no one had ever picked before.</span> <span id="s230">The Jewish religion.</span> <span id="s231">At that time, that was 1934, she had a young rabbi helping her.</span> <span id="s232">She did just marvelously.</span> <span id="s233">They had to give her straight A on it.</span> <span id="s234">She wanted to make a point, which was pretty brave at that time.</span> <span id="s235">I think that the reason she realized it more than I did was she was older and therefore more exposed.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">In Berlin we did not feel much, but in South Germany, where my mother was born they started immediately (to persecute) in 1933.</span> <span id="s237">They had immediately smashed stores, arrested people.</span> <span id="s238">My uncle was arrested.</span> <span id="s239">That was my mother’s youngest brother.</span> <span id="s240">He was a physician, a very successful one.</span> <span id="s241">He was living with a German woman.</span> <span id="s242">That was the excuse they used to put him in a concentration camp right away.</span> <span id="s243">He was extremely lucky.</span> <span id="s244">They kept him in, but they told him that if he signed that he would leave Germany immediately after they released him, they would let him go.</span> <span id="s245">So he spent only about four weeks in the camp.</span> <span id="s246">He was able to take all his belongings with him and he went to Israel (Palestine at that time).</span> <span id="s247">His then girl friend followed him there and they got married and they are still alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">My sister was more aware of these things as a teenager.</span> <span id="s249">She got to know some Zionist organizations and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s250">She got a little bit involved.</span> <span id="s251">So my grandmother from Darmstadt kept writing to my parents that they should take me out of school.</span> <span id="s252">It was about high time for that because teachers had their rules about what to say and how to say it and I guess maybe it was 50/50; some of them enjoyed it and some didn’t.</span> <span id="s253">I can’t judge.</span> <span id="s254">I was too young at that time, but it was getting pretty sticky.</span> <span id="s255">So I transferred to a Jewish school.</span> <span id="s256">There was a private Jewish school, the only one in Berlin, which was a high school.</span> <span id="s257">It was a super orthodox school.</span> <span id="s258">It was a very big adjustment for me.</span> <span id="s259">I didn’t have much of a Jewish education and it was so much harder than the public school.</span> <span id="s260">It was so that you had to use your brain.</span> <span id="s261">Everyone talked and there was no discipline.</span> <span id="s262">I have to say that I missed the discipline.</span> <span id="s263">I always had top grades and I barely made it that first semester.</span> <span id="s264">I really had a rough time.</span> <span id="s265">Then I worried a lot.</span> <span id="s266">I learned an awful lot and I had to take extra Hebrew lessons, but everything else.</span> <span id="s267">French, English, etc. we had an excellent English teacher, who hit us left and right, but she taught us.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: How far away was this school (from your home)?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: I took the El (elevated train).</span> <span id="s270">It took about fifteen minutes to get there and I was always late.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: You were by yourself, since your sister had already finished high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: I was thirteen.</span> <span id="s273">I was old enough to go.</span> <span id="s274">It was on the Tiergang, I don’t know if you ever heard of that, near the Zoo.</span> <span id="s275">That is a beautiful park.</span> <span id="s276">It is still in West Berlin, but it is closer to the center of Berlin.</span> <span id="s277">Of course (as is the custom in Europe) we had (separate) schools for boys and for girls in both the German public schools and the Jewish schools.</span> <span id="s278">They were super-orthodox and I became very religious there.</span> <span id="s279">Yes I gave my parents a terrible time.</span> <span id="s280">I would not ride on Saturday and I wouldn’t eat certain things.</span> <span id="s281">I went to the really super orthodox synagogue, you know where the men and women prayed in separate sections.</span> <span id="s282">I prayed a lot.</span> <span id="s283">My parents were not used to this.</span> <span id="s284">Then I learned that when I had something on my mind I said that they taught us this in school and my parents let it go.</span> <span id="s285">You know the manners were the thing when we were growing up.</span> <span id="s286">You know my mother always said.</span> <span id="s287">“A girl has to be a lady.”</span> <span id="s288">You know, that was it!</span> <span id="s289">They were not pious, but they got used to it.</span> <span id="s290">After that experience, I was an excellent student in school.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: How long did you go to that (Jewish) school?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: I went there for three and a half years.</span> <span id="s293">I graduated with a prize, what you don’t have here.</span> <span id="s294">When you don’t finish school, they graduate you when you don’t complete all the requirements.</span> <span id="s295">I went as far as “Oberskunda” (actually the second year of the two highest grades corresponding to eleventh grade).</span> <span id="s296">If I had gone for one more year, I would have finished and received the Arbitur, like my sister had; but I didn’t want to stay in school anymore.</span> <span id="s297">I had had it by then.</span> <span id="s298">I wanted to get out, and I fought with my parents about it, but they let me do it.</span> <span id="s299">I was getting involved in Zionist organizations also.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: What year was that?</span> <span id="s301">The school was continuing?</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: The school was continuing.</span> <span id="s303">I quit in 1938!</span> <span id="s304">That was just when “Kristallnacht” took place.</span> <span id="s305">I quit before that.</span> <span id="s306">The school stopped right after that anyway.</span> <span id="s307">I couldn’t have gone anymore.</span> <span id="s308">So I got out of school and my father said, “You have to do something.</span> <span id="s309">You can’t just lay around.”</span> <span id="s310">Of course, people were talking about that you have to leave, maybe leave the country.</span> <span id="s311">My father didn’t want to.</span> <span id="s312">My mother didn’t want to (leave the country).</span> <span id="s313">Neither one of them wanted to, but my sister wanted to and she did.</span> <span id="s314">She left in 1936.</span> <span id="s315">She went to my uncle when she was twenty-one.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: To Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: To Israel.</span> <span id="s318">She went, but my parents didn’t want to and my parents had all these friends who said, “Why should you leave, because of this guy.</span> <span id="s319">He is not even a German, he comes from Austria?</span> <span id="s320">You have been here for generations, you fought in the war, stick it out!</span> <span id="s321">Stick it out!”</span> <span id="s322">These were very smart people who said not to go anywhere.</span> <span id="s323">They didn’t want to go, they really didn’t want to go.</span> <span id="s324">As I said, I joined a Zionist organization, which upset my father quite a bit</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: He really was not a Zionist then?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: No!</span> <span id="s327">Neither was my mother.</span> <span id="s328">I belonged to another group.</span> <span id="s329">When things got bad in public school, I joined a German-Jewish organization and I made friends there.</span> <span id="s330">It seemed kind of pointless.</span> <span id="s331">When I got a little older, I joined the Zionist group.</span> <span id="s332">The Zionist group was kind of a radical labor group and my father thought that they marched with the red flag (symbol of Communism) and I thought that he would die.</span> <span id="s333">He said, “Never again are you going to go near these people!”</span> <span id="s334">So he enrolled me as a tailor apprentice with somebody, in a really high class place in West Berlin, on Kurfuerstendam.</span> <span id="s335">I stayed there for about four months and I learned things.</span> <span id="s336">I got to know a very nice Polish Jewish couple, a young couple with two children.</span> <span id="s337">He was a furrier and she was a seamstress.</span> <span id="s338">It was a salon, really a beautiful place.</span> <span id="s339">I imitated them.</span> <span id="s340">They did not speak very good German.</span> <span id="s341">They were very nice to me and they were trying to get to Australia.</span> <span id="s342">They asked my parents, if they would let me go with them, because they had these two young children who had to be managed and they would take care of me and all that.</span> <span id="s343">My father said no.</span> <span id="s344">I wish that I could have gone.</span> <span id="s345">So that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Then came Kristallncht.</span> <span id="s347">We heard about it.</span> <span id="s348">That this fellow had shot this Herr von Radt (the German attaché to the Embassy in Paris whose murder gave the pretext to confiscatory fines being levied against Jews and finally to Kristallnacht), and we felt very uncomfortable.</span> <span id="s349">Some good friends, German (gentile) friends came to my father and said “You better get out for awhile because they will come to arrest everyone.”</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: Your own area was not really attacked on Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: We had moved after my sister left, and our apartment was now in the old part of Charlottenburg, practically where my father was born, near where my grandfather’s store was.</span> <span id="s352">The store was of course damaged, not quite as bad as it could have been.</span> <span id="s353">At that time they did not destroy the apartments.</span> <span id="s354">They arrested all the men, except for the really old ones.</span> <span id="s355">We stayed with a real old couple, in their eighties, who were cousins of my grandfather’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: Your father and mother and you?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: Yes, We stayed there for about a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: You left everything in your own home?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A; Oh yes!</span> <span id="s360">We left everything, we just took overnight cases and stayed with Aunt Jennie and Uncle Felix and we figured what is going to happen will happen.</span> <span id="s361">Then of course we heard that a lot of arrests were made.</span> <span id="s362">They still had a relatively hard time in Berlin because the people there were a little different than those in the rest of the country.</span> <span id="s363">They did love to make up their own minds so they imported troops from South Germany and from West Prussia and from all over to do their dirty work for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: Did your father still have his business at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A; No, by that time he had given it up, because he had had a heart attack.</span> <span id="s366">We had great trouble with physicians.</span> <span id="s367">My father had a friend with whom he had been together in the war, a physician, and he treated him.</span> <span id="s368">We had, however, great trouble at that time.</span> <span id="s369">It was still customary to make house calls, but no (gentile) German doctor would come to a Jewish house.</span> <span id="s370">You were not allowed to have a maid anymore unless she was over 45 or 50 years old.</span> <span id="s371">The implication was that the Jewish men would, you know.</span> <span id="s372">That was truly ridiculous.</span> <span id="s373">My parents put on the wedding for the maid we had (when they got married) and everything else.</span> <span id="s374">We went and visited them and brought food from the country and everything.</span> <span id="s375">So we came back after Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s376">That was when my grandfather had to give up his store.</span> <span id="s377">He was forced to sell.</span> <span id="s378">They said, “If you don’t sell, they are going to take it.”</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: Was he able to sell it very well?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: No, it didn’t matter.</span> <span id="s381">They took the money and put it in a certain account that we had no access to.</span> <span id="s382">That is how my grandmother lost her place and that is the way my parents lost theirs, it was all like this.</span> <span id="s383">“We buy it but it goes into a special account.”</span> <span id="s384">So you lost it.</span> <span id="s385">We had to give up our gold and silver and diamonds and whatever and even the pets.</span> <span id="s386">That was the only time my mother put up a battle.</span> <span id="s387">She didn’t seem to care about anything else, but she would not give up her parakeet.</span> <span id="s388">She would not take it to the place where you had to hand it in, and she found a lady who did agree to take care of the parakeet and she would have visiting rights to the parakeet.</span> <span id="s389">She would not hear of anything else.</span> <span id="s390">My mother was so mild, so gentle, but with that parakeet she was like a tiger.</span> <span id="s391">She would not give her bird to the Nazis, no way!</span> <span id="s392">You know, she did not appear to care about anything else, let them have the silver.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: After you visited with the “aunt” and “uncle’, after Kristallnacht, you came back?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: We came back, and of course finally my father was a sick man by then.</span> <span id="s395">He had angina pectoris and he traveled around with a nitroglycerin bottle.</span> <span id="s396">He had had several attacks.</span> <span id="s397">I took care of him more or less.</span> <span id="s398">He was very nervous.</span> <span id="s399">He couldn’t stand anyone around him except me.</span> <span id="s400">My mother got so flustered, she just would make him more nervous.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">However, he realized then that there was no way we were going to make it (to outlast the Nazis).</span> <span id="s402">Finally, he thought that maybe we should leave.</span> <span id="s403">By that time, of course, it was too late.</span> <span id="s404">So they tried and tried.</span> <span id="s405">They finally found out that some people could go to Shanghai.</span> <span id="s406">We heard that quite a number of Jews went to Shanghai.</span> <span id="s407">Then all of a sudden he of course realized that I could go to Israel with the Hachsharah.</span> <span id="s408">That is a group of young people who proposed to live on the community farms in Israel, the kibbutz.</span> <span id="s409">Before that he would never let me go since “it was all so immoral there,’ that is what he thought.</span> <span id="s410">You know boys and girls together.</span> <span id="s411">Oh my!</span> <span id="s412">He didn’t let me go before.</span> <span id="s413">I did stay in the country for a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: He did let you go then?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: Oh no, no.</span> <span id="s416">I never got to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: No, but I made preparations to go to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: Oh, and where was that that you made your preparations)?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: Outside of Berlin.</span> <span id="s421">I was in several community farms.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: Oh yes, so there was actually still time to prepare to go to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: Well we thought that there was time, but actually there was only one more ship going, and that was it.</span> <span id="s424">But we stayed on these farms and we learned how to milk cows and how to make butter and clean the barns and what have you.</span> <span id="s425">It was great.</span> <span id="s426">We had campfires and we had community singing and we had Jewish services.</span> <span id="s427">We had everything.</span> <span id="s428">We had a self-contained little community and it was beautiful.</span> <span id="s429">It couldn’t get any better.</span> <span id="s430">We were away from everybody.</span> <span id="s431">We just lived there away from everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: No soldiers, no troops, came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: No, they didn’t come.</span> <span id="s434">We did have our own guards, because things did happen.</span> <span id="s435">I don’t remember any particular things, that people would come, I don’t know if it was SA or private people who were anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s436">They would generally throw firebombs inside (our perimeter), but since we were pretty much isolated nothing much happened.</span> <span id="s437">My parents tried to get out somewhere.</span> <span id="s438">They tried to get out to Shanghai, but it was too late.</span> <span id="s439">So they stayed in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Then the forced labor came in.</span> <span id="s441">They got my mother for forced labor.</span> <span id="s442">My father was certified too sick -- he couldn’t work.</span> <span id="s443">You can imagine how sick he was if the Nazis told him that he didn’t have to go.</span> <span id="s444">Of course, there was a lot of difficulties to live in Berlin then.</span> <span id="s445">I remember the one time when my father was crossing this street and some SS (Schutz Staffel the black shirted or elite Nazi troopers) came and hit him because he wanted to and we all had to wear the yellow stars.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: They started that right after Kristallnacht?</span> <span id="s447">You had to do that immediately?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s449">We had to wear the yellow star, after Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s450">We had a lot of kids sneak by without it because we had the curfew at 8PM.</span> <span id="s451">You know they just made spot checks.</span> <span id="s452">They went just through the house and just grabbed what they wanted, a mirror, or whatever.</span> <span id="s453">You were just scared to death and didn’t say a thing.</span> <span id="s454">You had a star on your door also, so they know where Jews lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: When you were at the farm, your parents continued to stay in the apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: Did you visit them at times?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: Yes, I went there.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: Transportation.</span> <span id="s460">Wasn’t that difficult?</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A: No, it wasn’t bad.</span> <span id="s462">We weren’t allowed to go too often.</span> <span id="s463">They didn’t want us to become too obvious.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: When your mother went into forced labor, where did she go to?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: They made her work in the Berlin insane asylum.</span> <span id="s466">She had to be there at 6 AM and it was way out of town on the subway lines for about one hour.</span> <span id="s467">She had never worked in her life.</span> <span id="s468">She had to be on her legs all day long.</span> <span id="s469">She couldn’t even understand half of what the people were talking about.</span> <span id="s470">You know she had never heard bad language in her life.</span> <span id="s471">The two of them were just so sweet, they just couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s472">She was just so sweet so they didn’t even treat her badly.</span> <span id="s473">She was just so sweet and simple so that they didn’t do anything to her.</span> <span id="s474">But she was so exhausted, she had never done anything like this.</span> <span id="s475">You know she had to do the hard work.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: So your father just stayed home then?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: He stayed because he couldn’t go elsewhere.</span> <span id="s478">And when I found that out I came home and I had bad frostbites.</span> <span id="s479">In had frostbites on my hands and my feet.</span> <span id="s480">My father said, “I think that you should have stayed home.”</span> <span id="s481">So I came home and you know you had to register at the police office.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: They told you where to register?</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s484">I did register and then I stayed with them until my parents were taken away.</span> <span id="s485">I worked in a factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: How were you treated in the factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: I wrote about that.</span> <span id="s488">We were completely regimented.</span> <span id="s489">We had a floor lady.</span> <span id="s490">In the morning we had to stand in front of the building on a certain spot.</span> <span id="s491">Everybody had to be there.</span> <span id="s492">The floor lady came and she marched you up to your place of work.</span> <span id="s493">We sat there and you better not open your mouth.</span> <span id="s494">I believe that once I stood back.</span> <span id="s495">She watched us.</span> <span id="s496">At lunch we sat right there and you ate your sandwich or whatever you had.</span> <span id="s497">We didn’t have much food, we didn’t have any coffee or butter since 1935.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: But you were able to buy food in the stores, what food there was?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: Yes, on ration tickets, whatever there was,</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: Almost the same as the other Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: No, we didn’t get all that they got, but if you had some good friends they were happy to help you.</span> <span id="s502">Our old maid came and sat there and tried to bring me something.</span> <span id="s503">When my father was sick and he needed something.</span> <span id="s504">Somebody came to help, you know with food.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: Was everyone Jewish who was working in the factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: On the floor where I worked they were all Jewish, but they also had French prisoners of war on the other side.</span> <span id="s507">(If they were French this must have been after 1939 since France entered the war in 1939 and the “phony war” lasted until May 1940).</span> <span id="s508">They kept us apart though.</span> <span id="s509">There was a lot happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: You marched?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: You marched in and you marched out.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: How long did you work there?</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s514">I believe that we worked about nine hours.</span> <span id="s515">It wasn’t quite as far (from home) as my mother (had to go) so I was lucky.</span> <span id="s516">It was kind of bad we went on the trolley.</span> <span id="s517">We weren’t allowed inside (the compartment), we had to stand on the platform.</span> <span id="s518">That was open and it was fun when it was raining.</span> <span id="s519">When it was really crowded, people pinched you whenever they felt like it.</span> <span id="s520">Our floor lady, (I believe it must have been as assembly line), made us work so much harder than I had ever worked before, it was so much harder.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: You must have been with it for two years.</span> <span id="s522">There must have been many people you worked with.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: Yes, I don’t remember the work we did.</span> <span id="s524">When I think back I remember one or two of the people I worked with.</span> <span id="s525">You just did your work and you waited for the day to be over and then you went home.</span> <span id="s526">Of course, the curfew started at 8PM so you didn’t have much time.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: You just got back from your work.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: What happened if you didn’t make it?</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: Well you were arrested.</span> <span id="s531">But of course the young people we sneaked out, we went into the house, took the star off and sneaked out and tried to have a fun party or something.</span> <span id="s532">But I couldn’t do that because I had to tend to my father.</span> <span id="s533">When I was five minutes late he was up and wild with worries about his heart.</span> <span id="s534">I knew that he had had several heart attacks and he was just very prone to problems.</span> <span id="s535">On the other hand I was lucky again my whole life was ahead of me.</span> <span id="s536">I don’t know about lucky, I should have been killed right there and then.</span> <span id="s537">I would have been better off.</span> <span id="s538">But, you know, I loved my father and about three months later they arrested him and shipped him off.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">This appears to be the end of interview #1.</span> <span id="s540">Interview #2 follows.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: I think that you can say as much as you want, because otherwise we may not have a (complete) story that can be related to.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: My father’s name was Martin Levy and my mother’s maiden name was Gertrude Berger, which is a good German name.</span> <span id="s543">I told you that she had to work in a factory there.</span> <span id="s544">(That appears to be a slight discrepancy, but it appears obvious that the Jewish forced laborers were shifted around as ever the whim struck someone).</span></p> <p><span id="s545">There was also a second cousin of my father’s living with us at the time.</span> <span id="s546">She was a spinster, about forty years of age.</span> <span id="s547">She had been with us during the time when I was in the country.</span> <span id="s548">She worked of course also in the forced labor setup.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: She was conscripted?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: Oh yes, yes!</span> <span id="s551">I don’t remember where she worked.</span> <span id="s552">It was not so far as I did because I know that I was the last one to come home at night usually.</span> <span id="s553">Of course, by that time, we knew that people were taken (meaning deportation of Jewish people) every day.</span> <span id="s554">There were hardly any of our friends left -- if we didn’t hear from them, they were gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">At first people got notices, postcards, which said: “You are to appear on this and this day at this and this place.</span> <span id="s556">You can bring one suitcase.”</span> <span id="s557">You were supposed to be there and German Jews were a lot like other Germans.</span> <span id="s558">That was an order.</span> <span id="s559">You did it!</span> <span id="s560">You did not question it!</span> <span id="s561">This is what people today, do not understand.</span> <span id="s562">“They were cowards!”</span> <span id="s563">“How come you did go along with this?”</span> <span id="s564">This is something, kind of instilled in the German people.</span> <span id="s565">You have rules and regulations in your life.</span> <span id="s566">You do live by these.</span> <span id="s567">You do not question them.</span> <span id="s568">It is not cowardice, it is just a way of life which is very hard to switch, especially for older people.</span> <span id="s569">To say all of a sudden, ‘hey, I am not going to do that why should I report?”</span> <span id="s570">(It is noteworthy that this is not just a German mode of behavior, as an example, if we receive a summons to be a witness or a jury notice, we obviously answer it.</span> <span id="s571">As long as a draft existed anyone who received a notice answered it or one violated the law).</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Also, the notices never stated one’s ultimate fate, but one’s fate was known if one failed to answer the summons.</span> <span id="s573">The young people did what their parents told them to, they were not raised like today’s children.</span> <span id="s574">When I met the first Americans, when I met a cousin of my mother’s and their kids talked back to him and I thought “Oh wow!”</span> <span id="s575">You know, we would never have done that.</span> <span id="s576">It was really a different way of upbringing and raising than we had had.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Then it came to the point where they did not send cards anymore.</span> <span id="s578">People assembled and of course, they thought that they were being sent away to a kind of ghetto settlement where they would work.</span> <span id="s579">They thought, of course, that the Jews should not contaminate the Aryans, that they should live by themselves.</span> <span id="s580">They provided them a place to live where they could follow their trade or whatever.</span> <span id="s581">Well this didn’t sound too bad, it really did not, and the foreign radio to which we listened even though we were not allowed to, (at least we tried to listen to it), did not say one word about what was going on.</span> <span id="s582">I do not know whether they did know what was going on.</span> <span id="s583">I am certain that the higher echelon knew about it later on as books claim -- but the radio did not tell us.</span> <span id="s584">It did not say “Go on, save yourselves, they are going to kill you.</span> <span id="s585">They are going to do something to you!”</span> <span id="s586">They didn’t tell us that.</span> <span id="s587">Nobody told us that!</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: Well you just assumed that?</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: It was a real location (stated on the cards) and we figured that the war would be over soon, and then the whole thing will be over, and later, if we can live through it, why not.</span> <span id="s590">Why not be with the others?</span> <span id="s591">Why not be with your own kind.</span> <span id="s592">There is nothing wrong with that (idea).</span> <span id="s593">You know what is there.</span> <span id="s594">At that time, I didn’t believe anyone cared about the money anymore because they figured that they will take that away anyway.</span> <span id="s595">However, then it came to the point that they no longer sent the cards -- they just showed up.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">This is what happened, it was on the 13th of August 1942 and I can never, to this day, I just hate Friday the 13th.</span> <span id="s597">My mother had always been very superstitious.</span> <span id="s598">We always laughed about how superstitious she was, but to this day I can never live through a Friday the 13th without thinking that something horrible is going to happen.</span> <span id="s599">Because it is what happened on Friday the 13th and it started as a routine day, it was the end of the week.</span> <span id="s600">I came home and I knew that I did not have to go to the factory (the next day).</span> <span id="s601">My mother was home already -- and I told you that she had very bad legs -- she was lying on the couch and my cousin Lotte was there, and my father, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">We were ready to sit down for dinner.</span> <span id="s603">We were just getting ready for the Shabbat and we were sitting there and then somebody knocked at the door.</span> <span id="s604">When someone knocked at the door, your heart fell about down to your knees, or to your toes.</span> <span id="s605">My father opened the door, because none of us were brave enough to go except my father.</span> <span id="s606">My father was an extremely “together man”, sick as he was, he was a smart man, he was a personable man, he was very dignified, he just looked good.</span> <span id="s607">He had been through the war.</span> <span id="s608">He had seen things.</span> <span id="s609">He went.</span> <span id="s610">Of course, there was the Gestapo (members of the “Geheime Stats Polizei” i.e. secret state police).</span> <span id="s611">There were just two average looking men in civilian clothes standing there.</span> <span id="s612">They didn’t look any different than, maybe, your husband or some other fellow in the street.</span> <span id="s613">They said “Martin Levy?’</span> <span id="s614">“Yes”.</span> <span id="s615">“We have the order for you and Gertrude your wife, to be ready for deportation.</span> <span id="s616">We are ready to come and get you.”</span> <span id="s617">Almost everyone had things just about packed and ready, but you know, it is always unexpected.</span> <span id="s618">My mother, of course, started crying, just right away.</span> <span id="s619">She just couldn’t handle it.</span> <span id="s620">So they said, “Well, you have about one hour.</span> <span id="s621">Get your things together.</span> <span id="s622">You know if you want to take warm blankets (go ahead).”</span> <span id="s623">You see, they kind of made us feel that it was a deportation.</span> <span id="s624">“So you probably will go to Russia, somewhere, so OK., you have about one hour.</span> <span id="s625">We will come back in one hour.”</span> <span id="s626">This is how certain they were that you were going to go.</span> <span id="s627">They left you there, at home, for an hour.</span> <span id="s628">Naturally there were some people who killed themselves -- a number of people -- but I don’t think anyone ran away.</span> <span id="s629">So they left.</span> <span id="s630">So we started, my mother, Lotte and I started like chickens with their heads cut off, getting things together.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">We had the suitcases and my father wanted a picture of my sister and he wanted a picture of me and he wanted this and that.</span> <span id="s632">We got the things together.</span> <span id="s633">My father got things organized.</span> <span id="s634">My mother kept saying, “You should come with us, I don’t see why not.”</span> <span id="s635">I forget whether she asked him (the Gestapo man) right away -- but I think that she asked him right away -- “How about my daughter, can she come?”</span> <span id="s636">The Gestapo man said “We don’t have an order for her.”</span> <span id="s637">So they asked me where I worked and I said at “Siemens” and he said that they were not going to take me because that was the biggest munitions factory and it was most important that I continue to work there.</span> <span id="s638">My mother was determined that I should come.</span> <span id="s639">My father wasn’t; I don’t know if he thought that I had a chance, but he made some preparations for this eventuality (our separation and deportation).</span> <span id="s640">He had money which he had not reported and had bought some jewelry which also had not been reported.</span> <span id="s641">The other jewelry (the ones people knew we had) had to be turned in.</span> <span id="s642">So he had bought some gold items some of which we had given to several of our German gentile friends whom he considered trustworthy.</span> <span id="s643">He had converted some stock into things which could be sold easily.</span> <span id="s644">Of these several people, some of them gave things to me and some didn’t.</span> <span id="s645">He kept telling me again, “There and there and there I have a lot of stuff.”</span> <span id="s646">If you need it it is yours, see what you can do.”</span> <span id="s647">Of course, after an hour, the Gestapo fellows came back.</span> <span id="s648">I asked them if I could go with my parents for a little bit.</span> <span id="s649">The meeting point, where everyone had to assemble was at the synagogue, a beautiful old synagogue, about a fifteen minute walk from our apartment.</span> <span id="s650">Then, on the street, a number of young people were gathered who shouted, ‘Dirty Jews!</span> <span id="s651">Get out!</span> <span id="s652">Get away!”</span> <span id="s653">You know, applauding the entire proceedings.</span> <span id="s654">So we came to the synagogue and they processed my parents through the door -- I wanted to go with them, but they wouldn’t let me.</span> <span id="s655">I was getting pretty hysterical by that time, you know standing there.</span> <span id="s656">Then one of the guys got rough with me, some SS guy: “You are going to get out of here!”</span> <span id="s657">You know that kind of thing.</span> <span id="s658">So I went home and my cousin Lotte was there.</span> <span id="s659">She was not a big help, she was just there.</span> <span id="s660">We were not really close or anything like that.</span> <span id="s661">But at that time I didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s662">I really didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s663">We had a balcony as part of our apartment, and I really wanted to jump off from it, because I was so disoriented at that time.</span> <span id="s664">Even try.</span> <span id="s665">You know why should I keep going to that darn factory and then finally wind up the same way?</span> <span id="s666">But then I thought well, you know, you might as well go on.</span> <span id="s667">Then Lotte talked to me.</span> <span id="s668">I don’t know I don’t believe that I slept that night.</span> <span id="s669">I didn’t want to go to bed.</span> <span id="s670">I stayed away the next day from the factory.</span> <span id="s671">I couldn’t face foul weather, I couldn’t handle it.</span> <span id="s672">I know that much.</span> <span id="s673">I didn’t call in, I didn’t do anything and the Gestapo came the next day and took inventory.</span> <span id="s674">We had beautiful furniture.</span> <span id="s675">That is most of it was handmade and there was so much china and crystal and stuff my mother had from her trousseau.</span> <span id="s676">Some of the things she hadn’t even wanted to use, china and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s677">She almost killed me once when I took it out when kids came over as company.</span> <span id="s678">So they took the inventory and all the stuff was divided among the SS party official who wanted the stuff.</span> <span id="s679">They told me that it would be all picked up in about a week.</span> <span id="s680">They asked me what belonged to me and, of course, my cousin Lotte was older and was wiser -- she was a pretty smart cookie and she said: ”this is mine” and “this is mine” and she could claim a lot of things (that way).</span> <span id="s681">I was too stoned and I was too hurt and too ignorant to even say anything so finally one of the Gestapo men said: I guess that bed is yours and that lamp is yours and that dresser is yours.</span> <span id="s682">I said yes, I guess so.</span> <span id="s683">Then he said you have about two weeks and then you have to vacate the premises.</span> <span id="s684">So that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">So I went back to work the next day.</span> <span id="s686">I had no choice.</span> <span id="s687">Furthermore, I had to find a place to live.</span> <span id="s688">It was pretty hard to find a place to live because Jews were assigned into small places for so many people.</span> <span id="s689">This one family I knew offered to take me in.</span> <span id="s690">They were some friends of my parents, but they were so overcrowded already that it was ridiculous.</span> <span id="s691">I was over at their house and they introduced me to a man.</span> <span id="s692">I guess that he was in his middle thirties.</span> <span id="s693">He had just been through the same thing.</span> <span id="s694">He had been living with his mother and his sister and they were both deported.</span> <span id="s695">They told him that he could keep the apartment if he rents to two more people.</span> <span id="s696">He already had rented to one girl in her thirties and he said, “I have another room, if you want to move in that would be OK.”</span> <span id="s697">I looked at the place and it looked all right, so I said that I would move in.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: Where did your cousin go to?</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: My cousin was an old maid like I said, she was forty and she was pretty ugly.</span> <span id="s700">She never really had had a good life.</span> <span id="s701">They were kind of the poor part of the family.</span> <span id="s702">Each child had to work, and all that.</span> <span id="s703">So she found herself a man whose wife had been deported and he offered her to move in with him.</span> <span id="s704">So she said, “Oh boy, that’s my chance!”</span> <span id="s705">She had led a sheltered life before so she said, “Kid, you are on your own!”</span> <span id="s706">So she moved in with that fellow.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: What about your grandparents?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: The only one who was left of the entire family was my grandmother in Darmstadt who was 78 at the time, I think.</span> <span id="s709">I had not been on good terms with her since I was thirteen because she didn’t like my father and I loved my father.</span> <span id="s710">Anyway, I wrote her that my parents had been deported.</span> <span id="s711">She had lived with my youngest aunt who had never been married.</span> <span id="s712">All her other children had either been married or had died or gone overseas like my uncle who was in Israel.</span> <span id="s713">The other uncle had died overseas in Buenos Airs.</span> <span id="s714">So there was no one else left.</span> <span id="s715">And that aunt, who had been the youngest one had been deported already, which left my grandmother alone.</span> <span id="s716">She was not only 78, but also partially blind when I wrote her that letter about my parents.</span> <span id="s717">I got a letter from her and she knitted me three pairs of underpants with long legs for the time when I would be deported so that I would have something warm to wear.</span> <span id="s718">That was the last I heard from her.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">She was deported to Theresienstadt, which camp was supposed to be the show place, but which really was no better as they found out later.</span> <span id="s720">However, that was the place where the Germans took the Red Cross and they reported that it was gorgeous and that everything was fine; that they had trees and that the people were walking around, dressed up.</span> <span id="s721">Naturally, behind the scenes they were killing the people in great numbers.</span> <span id="s722">Anyway, she was shipped to Theresienstadt at the age of 78.</span> <span id="s723">That was my maternal grandmother.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: Your other grandparents were already dead?</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: They had died during the early Hitler period of natural causes.</span> <span id="s726">My other aunt and uncles had all died.</span> <span id="s727">So my grandmother was the last one.</span> <span id="s728">My sister was with my uncle (and his wife) in Israel.</span> <span id="s729">I had some cousins in Uruguay, Paraguay, Buenos Aires (Argentina), Cuba, etc.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q: You were the only one still in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: I was the only one left, that is right.</span> <span id="s732">So I lived in the apartment and I became friendly with this girl and this man I lived with.</span> <span id="s733">The girl was talking a lot.</span> <span id="s734">This is the first time I knew that people went into hiding.</span> <span id="s735">Nobody really talked much about it because everyone was kind of afraid of it.</span> <span id="s736">Nobody wanted to give too much away, because somebody might let something slip somewhere.</span> <span id="s737">This girl was kind of tough anyway.</span> <span id="s738">She was at least ten years older than I was.</span> <span id="s739">I guess she was an orphan, she was kind of rough.</span> <span id="s740">She knew her way around.</span> <span id="s741">So I heard that she tried to make connections.</span> <span id="s742">She worked too, of course, forced labor, all of us did.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Now I have to backtrack and say something which happened.</span> <span id="s744">About two months before my parents got deported, my father had met a German gentile man through some business deal.</span> <span id="s745">It had something to do with property.</span> <span id="s746">My grandfather had owned a house and an apartment building and my father had tried to save something.</span> <span id="s747">It was connected with mortgages.</span> <span id="s748">This man had bought some mortgages which became due.</span> <span id="s749">He could have called them in and we would have been without anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">However, as it happened, this gentleman was very much anti-Hitler, a very devout Catholic.</span> <span id="s751">He was an old bachelor in his sixties.</span> <span id="s752">He had met my father and for some reason, the two men had really hit it off.</span> <span id="s753">They had talked together.</span> <span id="s754">I hadn’t met the man.</span> <span id="s755">I was at work (when he came over).</span> <span id="s756">They had talked and they had decided that the man would call in the mortgage and, therefore, get the house, but on the sly, he would pay something to my father.</span> <span id="s757">That payment was some of the money which my father then converted in the gold and valuables (he told me about before being deported).</span> <span id="s758">Of course, this was just like a gift from heaven.</span> <span id="s759">So the man did that and, since he and my father hit it off so well, he said that he would come by again in a little while, just to talk to him.</span> <span id="s760">He did come back I think twice, just to talk to my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">This man had properties all over Germany.</span> <span id="s762">His old parents were living on a farm near Berlin and he got some fresh food from this farm.</span> <span id="s763">You know my father kept raving what a nice man he was.</span> <span id="s764">So in the two weeks, while I was sitting in the empty apartment with nowhere to go, this man showed up.</span> <span id="s765">That was the first time I met him.</span> <span id="s766">His name was Emil Kreutziglor, (or something like this, the name is not clear on the tape).</span> <span id="s767">I saw this little grey haired man -- he gave me his name so I knew who he was.</span> <span id="s768">He wanted to know what happened and, of course I told him.</span> <span id="s769">He was absolutely put out -- he was terrified -- he seemed to blame himself (for the deportation).</span> <span id="s770">He was one of those German gentiles who was convinced that it just had to be over, it had to be over.</span> <span id="s771">It couldn’t last much longer.</span> <span id="s772">He said, “I should have taken your parents to the farm with me.</span> <span id="s773">They could have been there.”</span> <span id="s774">Now my mother looked like the typical gentile German, no one would ever have thought that she was Jewish, but nobody.</span> <span id="s775">My father did not look typically Jewish either.</span> <span id="s776">It would have been pretty easy for either one of them to get by (pass for non-Jewish), but my mother particularly.</span> <span id="s777">I know that you question that and I know that most Christians have a preconceived idea what a Jew looks like and how they act in certain ways.</span> <span id="s778">My mother had none of the mannerisms you would expect, in her speech or looks, or anything.</span> <span id="s779">She could certainly have gotten by.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">So anyway, this man said, “Well, what are you going to do?”</span> <span id="s781">I answered: “Nothing, I am trying to find a place to live and I am continuing to work at the factory.</span> <span id="s782">I guess they are going to get me one of these days and I hope that maybe I will hear from my parents.</span> <span id="s783">So maybe, if I am lucky, I will get to the same place.”</span> <span id="s784">And he answered, “Well, I will tell you this, this is my card here.</span> <span id="s785">If you feel that the time is coming that they are going to deport you -- it can’t last much longer -- l will certainly try to help you and take you to the farm.</span> <span id="s786">I will put you somewhere, if you want to.</span> <span id="s787">Get in touch with me, this is my address.</span> <span id="s788">This is my card.”</span> <span id="s789">Well, OK.</span> <span id="s790">OK.</span> <span id="s791">I took his card and I kept it.</span> <span id="s792">I really didn’t understand, you know, my mind wasn’t on that.</span> <span id="s793">I just didn’t know where I was going to sleep, what I was going to do, what was coming off.</span> <span id="s794">The only friends I had were a couple of young kids – about my age.</span> <span id="s795">I had been in Hachsharah with, and they all didn’t know what they were going to do.</span> <span id="s796">So anyway, I moved to the apartment and I went to the factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Well, there were just rumors every day.</span> <span id="s798">We went to work and we came home.</span> <span id="s799">We tried to listen to the BBC (British Broadcasting System).</span> <span id="s800">They furnished regular newscasts in all different languages to the various German and occupied countries at specific times every evening or night.</span> <span id="s801">This task was later taken up by the (Voice of America network) to try to see how the war was going.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">I didn’t hear a single word from my parents.</span> <span id="s803">We heard that some people had received news or about people who had been deported.</span> <span id="s804">We had reports that some of them said that everything was OK.</span> <span id="s805">That it was primitive, but that it was basically acceptable.</span> <span id="s806">Later on we found out that they were forced to give this news.</span> <span id="s807">Some of them of course got a letter which said that the ashes had been delivered.</span> <span id="s808">You know they all died (reportedly) of pneumonia.</span> <span id="s809">(The above all pertains to news received from the camps).</span> <span id="s810">Nobody died of anything else.</span> <span id="s811">So I lived there (in that apartment with that fellow and this girl).</span></p> <p><span id="s812">It was August when my parents were taken and early the next year, we had a meeting at the factory where they said that they were going to get new workers.</span> <span id="s813">The German soldiers went through the streets in Poland and in the Baltic states, which they had conquered.</span> <span id="s814">What they did is that they drove around in trucks and they picked up women from the streets as they walked, they shipped them to Germany.</span> <span id="s815">They put them in camps and then they proceeded to use them as forced laborers, as we were being used.</span> <span id="s816">Therefore, a whole bunch of women had arrived and were put in a camp near the Siemens factory.</span> <span id="s817">So they said, “they are going to work here and you are going to show them what you have been doing” -- you know, us Jews.</span> <span id="s818">So these people could not speak German, they were pathetic!</span> <span id="s819">They had come from their own countries -- with just their coats on their backs -- without anything else.</span> <span id="s820">They were just dumped there.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">I came home that night.</span> <span id="s822">Of course, I had discussed all of that with this man (the owner of the apartment) and that girl.</span> <span id="s823">He said, “You know, you got to do something.</span> <span id="s824">If you’re ever going to do something you got to do something now!</span> <span id="s825">As soon as the people stop your work, you are going to be deported.</span> <span id="s826">The new people are going to be in so that the Jews are naturally going to be out.”</span> <span id="s827">I remember that night.</span> <span id="s828">We sat up all night long and he kept asking me, “Isn’t there anybody you know who can help you, or do something?”</span> <span id="s829">I think that it was like two in the morning when I said, “Well there was this man my father knew.</span> <span id="s830">He gave me his card and maybe I should contact him.”</span> <span id="s831">He said, “You write him!”</span> <span id="s832">and he dictated this letter.</span> <span id="s833">He said “mail the card” I wrote just “this is where I live and I would like to see you as soon as possible.”</span> <span id="s834">I got an instant reply in the mail two days later.</span> <span id="s835">I received a card that he was going to come and see me the following Sunday.</span> <span id="s836">Of course this was extremely brave of this man, just to go into a Jewish house, with the star outside and everything.</span> <span id="s837">He did come on Sunday morning and I told him what was happening.</span> <span id="s838">I said that I felt it was a matter of maybe two weeks, or at the most four weeks, and that would be it.</span> <span id="s839">So he said “OK.</span> <span id="s840">Let me think!”</span> <span id="s841">This is the thing which is so strange when people think that you go underground and you read these books and see these movies.</span> <span id="s842">You think that they are spy stories with the code words, the raincoats and everything like that.</span> <span id="s843">It was nothing like that.</span> <span id="s844">This man had wealth, as I said, he was a very wealthy man with property all over Germany.</span> <span id="s845">He said, “Listen, I own an apartment building in Heiligensee,” which is a good part of town, but it was far enough from where I had been born so that I was not familiar with these people, that no one would know me.</span> <span id="s846">“I have a tenant there, she is a sick lady.</span> <span id="s847">She has a three-year old child.</span> <span id="s848">She rents the smoke shop.”</span> <span id="s849">Every apartment building had one smoke shop.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">The residential neighborhood in Heiligensee was beautiful.</span> <span id="s851">The man told me that she had had a hard life, she had a rough time, the kid is three years old and she still doesn’t know who the father is.</span> <span id="s852">She is incorrigible.</span> <span id="s853">She is hanging around with three guys.</span> <span id="s854">However, the war brought her some prosperity because a smoke shop -- of cigarettes, she had all kinds of black market cigarettes, she just had had everything so that she could pay her rent.</span> <span id="s855">But she was grateful to the man that he had let her go on for all these years without evicting her.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">“Let’s go there!</span> <span id="s857">I will call.</span> <span id="s858">I think that she has an extra room.”</span> <span id="s859">She had a little apartment behind the smoke shop.</span> <span id="s860">We went there that same afternoon.</span> <span id="s861">We had decided that he would introduce me as his niece, from out of town who had been bombed out.</span> <span id="s862">This made a lot of sense because many cities throughout Germany had been bombed.</span> <span id="s863">A lot of people were running around in Berlin, they were from out of town, they had lost their houses or/ and family, they were kind of at loose ends.</span> <span id="s864">So we just went there and we met the lady.</span> <span id="s865">He introduced me.</span> <span id="s866">“This is my niece Burger.”</span> <span id="s867">I had decided to take my mother’s maiden name, because I couldn’t very well continue with “Levy.”</span> <span id="s868">He said, “Well she has lost her family and things.</span> <span id="s869">I would like her to go into your spare room.”</span> <span id="s870">The woman said, “OK sure.”</span> <span id="s871">She shows me the room.</span> <span id="s872">It’s 10 PM and Herr Kreutz said, “OK here is the first weeks rent, and she will move in tomorrow.”</span> <span id="s873">That was all there was to it.</span> <span id="s874">So, of course, it was kind of strange.</span> <span id="s875">I had never seen anything like it.</span> <span id="s876">I don’t know if you want to hear any details about it or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">I never met anybody like Frau Winneman.</span> <span id="s878">She had that little apartment behind the smoke shop.</span> <span id="s879">It was filthy, it was cluttered up and it was dark.</span> <span id="s880">She was a woman in her thirties.</span> <span id="s881">She could have been pretty.</span> <span id="s882">She was small.</span> <span id="s883">She had some nice features, but she had pockmarks all over and she had kind of yellow stumps for teeth.</span> <span id="s884">So she wasn’t exactly beautiful.</span> <span id="s885">She wore her nightgown all day long but she managed to buy a fur coat.</span> <span id="s886">She wore that over her nightgown and she wore her felt slippers and she had a cigarette hanging out of her mouth.</span> <span id="s887">Constantly she played solitaire.</span> <span id="s888">Then there was chocolate all over the house and smoked eel and everything.</span> <span id="s889">It was filthy.</span> <span id="s890">The kid was on the floor and she had the most expensive toys in the world.</span> <span id="s891">She sat on the filthy floor with her dirty torn underwear, just having a good time on the floor.</span> <span id="s892">The kid (little Karen) was a darling little kid.</span> <span id="s893">You know, a little blond blue-eyed child.</span> <span id="s894">Just as sweet as could be.</span> <span id="s895">There also was a big fat cat.</span> <span id="s896">That cat was fed better than anyone in the entire German Reich.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Q: You lived in a room within her apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: Oh yes, indeed.</span> <span id="s899">She had her bedroom, then she had one room in the back which she didn’t use and I found out that the mattress was full of bed bugs.</span> <span id="s900">This was not very attractive, you know.</span> <span id="s901">But, anyway, she did not ask any questions -- so I moved in there.</span> <span id="s902">Now my problem was where to spend the days, because nobody -- in those days -- could fail to work.</span> <span id="s903">It was just impossible for someone not to work.</span> <span id="s904">You know every man worked.</span> <span id="s905">If he was young enough they joined the army.</span> <span id="s906">If they were too old they were somehow involved in some kind of military thing, outside the home.</span> <span id="s907">Every woman worked unless she had children or something to do with children.</span> <span id="s908">So I had to tell her that I worked somewhere.</span> <span id="s909">So I had to invent an office which was super secret and that is why she couldn’t call me there.</span> <span id="s910">You know I couldn’t take a chance that she would call to check up on me.</span> <span id="s911">Of course everyone was afraid -- the Germans were afraid.</span> <span id="s912">You know, secret, secret!</span> <span id="s913">You got to stay away from that.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">So, in the beginning I went back to the old apartment.</span> <span id="s915">You know I left in the morning at eight and didn’t come home until five or six.</span> <span id="s916">I do forget what time I set my hours.</span> <span id="s917">In the beginning I also went back to the old place where I had worked -- but that didn’t last very long because the guy said “Hey any day now they are going to get me!”</span> <span id="s918">He had no chance at all to go underground.</span> <span id="s919">His looks were against him.</span> <span id="s920">He had very long ears and a very big nose.</span> <span id="s921">You know that he would have been identified as a Jew anywhere.</span> <span id="s922">He just had no choice!</span> <span id="s923">He knew that it was going to happen.</span> <span id="s924">The girl was going to leave also to go into the underground.</span> <span id="s925">So I spent my days there for about six weeks and then he told me “you can’t come anymore.</span> <span id="s926">It is too dangerous!”</span> <span id="s927">They had deported a couple of families from that house.</span> <span id="s928">One young couple -- the woman was pregnant, at the time -- and they had a three-year old child, they took them.</span> <span id="s929">So my problem was what to do all day long.</span> <span id="s930">I covered the city of Berlin.</span> <span id="s931">I went to movies, I sat through movies four times.</span> <span id="s932">I went into museums.</span> <span id="s933">I went into parks when the weather was nice.</span> <span id="s934">I stayed away from my old neighborhood.</span> <span id="s935">I had, at this time, no papers whatsoever, because I had had to throw all papers (with the name Levy) away, and I had not been able to get any others.</span> <span id="s936">I had no connections through whom I could have gotten papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: Were you ever afraid that you might be stopped?</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: I was constantly afraid of being stopped!</span> <span id="s939">Anybody looking at me half way, I thought that that is what they were getting ready to do.</span> <span id="s940">You know, I thought that they were going to get me.</span> <span id="s941">Another problem was that (without proper identification papers), I had absolutely no rationing ticket.</span> <span id="s942">You only got your food rationing tickets at the police station where you were to register.</span> <span id="s943">If you weren’t registered, you didn’t get any food stamps.</span> <span id="s944">So I had no food stamps (i.e. rationing tickets were needed to buy food in war time Europe, not like our food stamps to get food for free).</span> <span id="s945">Mr. Kreutz gave me a few food stamps and I had some contacts on the black market (those were the collection of places including some stores where you could buy things often at exorbitant prices, without the proper amount of rationing cards) but the prices were like 100 DM for one pound of butter and prices along these lines.</span> <span id="s946">It was very hard to get and it was not necessary.</span> <span id="s947">Of course my landlady thought that, as was normally done, I would give her the food stamps, since she cooked for me.</span> <span id="s948">So I had to make up excuses, or go to a restaurant or whatever.</span> <span id="s949">Of course she had so much food that it was spoiling, it was rotting and she fed me anyway.</span> <span id="s950">I guess she like me.</span> <span id="s951">I became so involved with her and the kid and they had no one else in the world.</span> <span id="s952">They took me in like.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Q: So you were able to manage (through her?</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A: They took me in like family.</span> <span id="s955">I didn’t eat there regularly, just whenever it happened.</span> <span id="s956">Then I kept on thinking, “What in the heck am I going to do!”</span> <span id="s957">I remembered a Chinese fellow who owned a restaurant, we used to go there for years and years, my father, my mother and I.</span> <span id="s958">The man had been born in China and he came illegally to Germany and he told us how he was against Hitler.</span> <span id="s959">He had been through hell and he told us how he always had been against Hitler, and stuff.</span> <span id="s960">I contacted him after his restaurant was closed and he helped me out.</span> <span id="s961">He tried to feed me, he gave me some food rationing tickets.</span> <span id="s962">So you see, I just snacked wherever I could, that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">However, the hardest part was where to spend the time.</span> <span id="s964">That was another danger.</span> <span id="s965">Very few, but there were some of the Jewish people who had made a deal with the Gestapo -- and I don’t blame them, if it saved their own necks; they went around the streets trying to find people like me.</span> <span id="s966">I met one girl, now I didn’t talk to anybody.</span> <span id="s967">I just looked at them, but I met one girl and I knew that she was one of them because I had worked with her in the factory.</span> <span id="s968">She saw me very clearly, just as I saw her, and for some reason she let me go.</span> <span id="s969">They got her in the end.</span> <span id="s970">I feel very bad about it.</span> <span id="s971">I can’t blame her.</span> <span id="s972">No one can blame anybody, since when it comes to saving your own neck no one knows what he or she is going to do.</span> <span id="s973">No one can judge anybody.</span> <span id="s974">So the days went by OK.</span> <span id="s975">I tried to stay pretty far away from my landlady and all that, but it was impossible because you were suspect, if you weren’t friendly.</span> <span id="s976">Then came the question, if you weren’t friendly, why were you not friendly.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">I got into a situation which I believe that it was easier.</span> <span id="s978">I think that the kid was going to be four years old and she had a Christening.</span> <span id="s979">She was going to have her baptized.</span> <span id="s980">They still hadn’t found out who the father was.</span> <span id="s981">You had to have the name of the father to have her baptized.</span> <span id="s982">So she cleaned out the apartment for once.</span> <span id="s983">She put clothes on and there was a lot of food and a lot of booze and I helped with all the preparations, but I didn’t want to go home (to the apartment) that night because I was so scared since I knew that they were going to have a lot of people there.</span> <span id="s984">I didn’t know who was going to ask me what questions, so I came home late and she was just furious with me.</span> <span id="s985">They made me drink a glass full of schnapps (brandy) which is unreal and I of course, wasn’t used to that.</span> <span id="s986">Maybe I drank a little wine or a taste of beer.</span> <span id="s987">They made me drink that, and I became deathly ill as a matter of fact as ill as I ever was in all my life.</span> <span id="s988">She thought that that was great, that that was just cool, you know.</span> <span id="s989">You know, get drunk and being sick.</span> <span id="s990">They woke me up with aspirin and coffee.</span> <span id="s991">Then she did accept me.</span> <span id="s992">Now that I was a person like everybody else (who got drunk) that was great.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">Then we had neighbors.</span> <span id="s994">He was a white Russian and she was a German.</span> <span id="s995">I guess that she used to be a call girl, at one time, but she was OK.</span> <span id="s996">His name was Ivan Rickhoffhausen von Alteis, but we called him Ivan, that was the Russian who came over during the revolution.</span> <span id="s997">They made vodka in the basement.</span> <span id="s998">Every night we drank vodka endlessly and ate zekuska as the Russians do.</span> <span id="s999">He thought that if you drink and eat with it, that is how you keep from getting drunk, you eat smoked fish, caviar, whatever, but drink that vodka is what Frau Winneman kept saying, also.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Then the bombing raids came, and we had to drag everything to the bunker.</span> <span id="s1001">We took Karen’s baby buggy and loaded that buggy, threw the kid on top.</span> <span id="s1002">The kid was asleep and the cat jumped in and we all dragged everything to the bunker.</span> <span id="s1003">The bunker was about three blocks away.</span> <span id="s1004">Everyone who has never been through a bombing cannot imagine what it is like.</span> <span id="s1005">You sit there and you hear a whistling and you hear the crash and then the entire business shakes.</span> <span id="s1006">And that was a building which was built for a bunker, that means a massive building.</span> <span id="s1007">Everyone sits around with these bright lights and the Volksturm, the old men who were not in the service directing everything.</span> <span id="s1008">So everyone sat there waiting.</span> <span id="s1009">They had as many clothes on as they could possibly wear because they didn’t know whether they would find anything when they came home after an air raid.</span> <span id="s1010">Half of the women got hysterical.</span> <span id="s1011">Some of them would just sit there, perfectly rigid.</span> <span id="s1012">Kids usually slept through it.</span> <span id="s1013">They were so conditioned.</span> <span id="s1014">Then, when it was all over you walked out and then you looked and saw the fires and the ruins and you wonder; “Oh, my God, is there something to come home to?”</span> <span id="s1015">Our neighbor used to get so drunk when he heard the siren that he went out in the street and yell “Come-on you little bombs, come on!”</span> <span id="s1016">We had to drag him back into the house.</span> <span id="s1017">He would pass out in the basement.</span> <span id="s1018">My landlady would pass out on the sidewalk.</span> <span id="s1019">We had to drag her also.</span> <span id="s1020">It was wild!</span> <span id="s1021">It was really wild.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">My money was running out and I did not have any connections to sell the jewelry.</span> <span id="s1023">It was getting worse to spend all that time on the street.</span> <span id="s1024">In addition to that, my landlady had a neighbor who started asking a lot of questions.</span> <span id="s1025">This was an older gentile German woman who would never normally associate with my landlady.</span> <span id="s1026">She was much too high class (for my landlady), but the war was going on and she was a smoker (so she wanted something from my landlady).</span> <span id="s1027">She started asking questions.</span> <span id="s1028">My landlady told me that she was annoyed about it.</span> <span id="s1029">She had no suspicion about me, but this woman evidently had suspicions.</span> <span id="s1030">What gave my landlady suspicions is that I would not go out with the German soldiers, that annoyed her.</span> <span id="s1031">She could not understand why I wouldn’t date anybody.</span> <span id="s1032">She said; “you are a young girl, why shouldn’t you go out and date?”</span> <span id="s1033">I told her that I had a dead fiancé and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s1034">So anyway, it was getting tenuous and I didn’t know how long I could hold out anymore.</span> <span id="s1035">So I turned out to be very lucky again by fate.</span> <span id="s1036">All my life it was never anything I did with my own brains.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">Q: I was going to ask you about how long did you stay (at Frau Winneman’s?)</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">A: I stayed with her about three fourths of a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: Through the winter and the summer then.</span> <span id="s1040">How were you able to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">A: Well, that is what I said, with movies through which I sat two or three times.</span> <span id="s1042">I went to museums, you know, Berlin is full of museums.</span> <span id="s1043">You can go into the big department stores, I spent a lot of time there.</span> <span id="s1044">You get very resourceful if you have to.</span> <span id="s1045">You know your feet hurt, but you just plain have to find a different place to go every day.</span> <span id="s1046">You couldn’t go to the same place, or they would recognize you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Well, anyway, this girl I used to share the apartment with (before I went underground), she had a boy friend at the time.</span> <span id="s1048">He used to come and spend the weekend.</span> <span id="s1049">We all suspected that he definitely would go underground, and as a matter of fact, that he already lived underground because he never wore a star.</span> <span id="s1050">He looked very average, you know, sandy hair, freckles and all around just average.</span> <span id="s1051">He was thirty.</span> <span id="s1052">I never knew too much about him.</span> <span id="s1053">As I said, nobody asked anybody any questions, you just kind of kept your mouth shut.</span> <span id="s1054">So I figured that he had gone underground and that the girl had gone underground.</span> <span id="s1055">I did figure that they still would be together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">Well, one day on the street, somebody called me by name and I thought, “Well that’s it!”</span> <span id="s1057">So I turned around and it was this guy.</span> <span id="s1058">His name was Emil Messerstruck (or something close to this name).</span> <span id="s1059">I don’t think that I ever was so glad to see anyone in my life.</span> <span id="s1060">You know, that was the only one.</span> <span id="s1061">You have to realize that for all this time I had not be in contact with any other Jewish person.</span> <span id="s1062">I had not listened to any BBC or anything.</span> <span id="s1063">I had no idea of what was going on in the war.</span> <span id="s1064">You know the papers were full of German victories all along.</span> <span id="s1065">Of course, I knew that the air raids were taking place, but we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1066">So anyway, he and I went into some coffee or restaurant and he told me that the girl -- his girlfriend -- had been caught also.</span> <span id="s1067">She was ready to go underground but she wanted to pick up her last pay check from work in the factory.</span> <span id="s1068">She picked up the pay check.</span> <span id="s1069">At that time the Gestapo raided everybody and she got caught for that last pay check.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">So he was living in hiding and he had gotten hold of some papers and he worked for a German grocer as an accountant.</span> <span id="s1071">He had been working for him for years.</span> <span id="s1072">He knew him.</span> <span id="s1073">He was a very smart cookie.</span> <span id="s1074">The gentile German grocer figured that it is a good idea to keep a Jew handy because, if the war goes wrong, they would go into business together.</span> <span id="s1075">They had plans to set up a chain store such as the A &amp;P, big plans you know.</span> <span id="s1076">Emil worked for this grocer.</span> <span id="s1077">He got food from him, which one can expect from a grocer.</span> <span id="s1078">He got ration tickets from him.</span> <span id="s1079">The guy took him in and gave him some.</span> <span id="s1080">You know, you could pull deals that way.</span> <span id="s1081">He had a room out in the suburbs of Berlin.</span> <span id="s1082">He had some papers that he was draft deferred because of some kind of heart ailment.</span> <span id="s1083">You could say that he was in pretty good shape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">So I told him what I was doing.</span> <span id="s1085">He said, “Hey, you got to cut this out.</span> <span id="s1086">This is an awfully dangerous game you are playing, that running around.</span> <span id="s1087">Let me get you some papers to start with.”</span> <span id="s1088">He got me an identification card stating that I was working at such and such a place, with a photograph.</span> <span id="s1089">That was an awfully good thing to have.</span> <span id="s1090">He said that he was going to try to find another place for me.</span> <span id="s1091">He had connections on the black market and stuff.</span> <span id="s1092">He could help me sell all the jewelry.</span> <span id="s1093">He started coming to the house.</span> <span id="s1094">My landlady didn’t like him.</span> <span id="s1095">She thought that he was too old for me, that he wasn’t good looking enough.</span> <span id="s1096">She just didn’t like him.</span> <span id="s1097">He was kind of a standoffish person, you know, he didn’t like to be bothered.</span> <span id="s1098">He had had a very tough life.</span> <span id="s1099">His parents were from Lithuania.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">After a while, in a very poor section of Berlin, we found an apartment house, with a courtyard and an other apartment house behind it.</span> <span id="s1101">There we found a room on the ground floor.</span> <span id="s1102">It was a dark, back apartment building, really grungy and grimy with a toilet in the hall.</span> <span id="s1103">We established that we were a couple and that I was not well, and therefore could not work, so now I could spend my days in the house in the house without having to run around in the streets while he went to work every day, which was a good thing.</span> <span id="s1104">He had a place to go and he did work and he brought the food and stuff.</span> <span id="s1105">We sold the jewelry, as we needed to, little by little, because we had to get clothes and food and other things.</span> <span id="s1106">These things, including the incidentals mostly came from the black market.</span> <span id="s1107">I still kept in touch with the Chinese man from the restaurant, because you could not afford to lose contact with anybody.</span> <span id="s1108">You might need them again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">Q: Did the landlady question you that you had a wedding or was she just satisfied that you had gone off to live together?</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">A: Oh no!</span> <span id="s1111">Oh no!</span> <span id="s1112">that would have been impossible.</span> <span id="s1113">We said that we were married.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">Q: But you didn’t ask the landlady to the wedding and she was not insulted?</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">A: No, no, no!</span> <span id="s1116">She thought that Emil and I had gotten married and that I was a fool.</span> <span id="s1117">That was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">Q: I was wondering why she did not want to throw a big wedding knowing how she was about parties.</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">A: She just didn’t like him, like I said.</span> <span id="s1120">However, I went to visit her by myself.</span> <span id="s1121">However, the new landlady knew what was going on.</span> <span id="s1122">I think that I might mention her boy friend because that was important that nut or whoever he was was out for the money.</span> <span id="s1123">We paid an exorbitant price for that place, something like it these days we would pay $300 for a place like that, or maybe even $500 (depending on the value of the DM).</span> <span id="s1124">So we lived there because they wanted the money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">In the meantime, the old scrub lady stayed with her son.</span> <span id="s1126">You know it was her apartment (which she rented to us) but she stayed with her son.</span> <span id="s1127">The apartment was a room with a hot plate and a toilet down the hall.</span> <span id="s1128">So I played my records a lot and I visited the Chinese restaurant and I visited my former landlady.</span> <span id="s1129">My friend Emil got very angry at me when I did that.</span> <span id="s1130">He thought that I was taking chances.</span> <span id="s1131">I just couldn’t handle it.</span> <span id="s1132">You go nuts if you don’t go out and see somebody sometime.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">One day I got sick on the street.</span> <span id="s1134">I fainted and they had to get an ambulance.</span> <span id="s1135">I thought that was going to be it, but for some reason they didn’t question who I was.</span> <span id="s1136">As it turned out, it was a pretty good thing, because the people in the apartment building truly believed (after that) that I was really sick.</span> <span id="s1137">As it turned out, I only had the cramps, that I passed out, but it all kind of helped.</span> <span id="s1138">So we lived there for a while and then the landlady’s boy friend got greedy.</span> <span id="s1139">He wanted more money.</span> <span id="s1140">We kind of offered to meet him half way up to what he demanded.</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">That went on for a few weeks and then Frau Gieser came and talked to us one day.</span> <span id="s1142">She said, “Hey, that man is going to turn you in, he wants more money, he thinks that he can get someone else and then get more money.</span> <span id="s1143">So either you pay him a lot or he is going to turn you in.”</span> <span id="s1144">That was pretty decent of her.</span> <span id="s1145">That was half way decent, but half way she was scared to death that someone would find out that she is involved.</span> <span id="s1146">You know, if it was known that she was hiding Jews, that would be her neck just the same.</span> <span id="s1147">When she told us that, we had to get out the same night.</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">Now Emil could go back to his old room where he used to live -- because they never knew that anything was wrong.</span> <span id="s1149">He had told them that he was out of town and other stories.</span> <span id="s1150">I had no place to go.</span> <span id="s1151">I went to Frau Winneman for one night.</span> <span id="s1152">I said that I had had a fight (with Emil) and “Can I stay here overnight?”</span> <span id="s1153">She said “sure!”</span> <span id="s1154">However I couldn’t stay there longer because that would have been really worse with that one lady asking.</span> <span id="s1155">It was impossible.</span> <span id="s1156">I had no idea what to do.</span> <span id="s1157">This Frau Gieser who had rented us a place, her son was a janitor in another apartment building.</span> <span id="s1158">His wife and kids had been sent to the country because of the bombing and they did decide that I could stay there for a while.</span> <span id="s1159">So I went there.</span> <span id="s1160">I stayed there one night when he started to get awfully friendly.</span> <span id="s1161">I just freaked out and the next morning I got hold of Emil at work.</span> <span id="s1162">I said that I was not going to stay there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">I wondered, “Who am I going to call and what will I do?”</span> <span id="s1164">Then I remembered that my uncle, my favorite uncle, had been married to a gentile German woman.</span> <span id="s1165">He had divorced her because she was very fond of men and very fond of drink.</span> <span id="s1166">However, in spite of the divorce they had remained on good terms.</span> <span id="s1167">The uncle had passed away and my father had given her all the furniture and everything and we had remained on good terms.</span> <span id="s1168">She had really loved my uncle.</span> <span id="s1169">She was crazy about him.</span> <span id="s1170">It was just one of those things, she was just too fond of men and drink and that was it.</span> <span id="s1171">So, I decided to call her.</span> <span id="s1172">I found her in the phone book and I called her.</span> <span id="s1173">She just about passed out when I told who I was.</span> <span id="s1174">I said: “I have got to talk to you.”</span> <span id="s1175">She said, “Come on!”</span> <span id="s1176">She had an apartment way across town.</span> <span id="s1177">It was a good thing that Berlin is a great big city.</span> <span id="s1178">I went there and told her that I had to have a place to stay.</span> <span id="s1179">She had had no idea that I was still around.</span> <span id="s1180">She had figured that everyone of us was dead.</span> <span id="s1181">She worked in some war office and had a boy friend who was a big shot general who was, thank God, out of town.</span> <span id="s1182">She said, ‘Now, you can stay here, but you can’t go in and out.</span> <span id="s1183">You have to be completely quiet because some of the people know that I used to be married to a Jew at one time, and it is too dangerous with the general and all that stuff.</span> <span id="s1184">See what you can do and I will see what I can do and we’ll figure something out.</span> <span id="s1185">In the meantime, you have to stay here.”</span> <span id="s1186">Now this was on the fourth floor and there were a lot of bombing raids and, of course, I could not go to the basement which was kind of creepy because staying on the fourth floor is no fun when you see the crash!</span> <span id="s1187">And everything (of an air raid).</span> <span id="s1188">So I stayed there for about two weeks.</span> <span id="s1189">Food was no problem.</span> <span id="s1190">It was clean, it was nice, it was like a kind of vacation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">Then this so called aunt, well we have always called her aunt Friedl.</span> <span id="s1192">She had an aunt who was an older lady who worked in a factory, an old maid “Tante Emma.”</span> <span id="s1193">Tante Emma (Tante is the German word for aunt) had a little cottage outside of Berlin, a weekend cottage you know, a little frame place where she used to go on weekends.</span> <span id="s1194">She still worked in the factory.</span> <span id="s1195">So, she decided that I could have that cottage.</span> <span id="s1196">There were some neighbors around, but they were not the nosy type.</span> <span id="s1197">They were pretty nice people.</span> <span id="s1198">One was a school principal who had retired and was living there with his wife.</span> <span id="s1199">A lot of people went out there because of the bombing of Berlin it was so bad, that it was not unusual to go there and stay there.</span> <span id="s1200">So I went there and we established right there and then that I was married and my husband was working in town and that he would come out over the weekend.</span> <span id="s1201">This way, a working set-up was determined.</span> <span id="s1202">I stayed there all through the week and Emil came over the weekend and brought me food and whatever I needed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">Tante Emma came on her bicycle.</span> <span id="s1204">She had learned how to ride a bicycle when she was 65 -- and she had a pet.</span> <span id="s1205">You wouldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s1206">It was a chicken without legs which she called Chicky.</span> <span id="s1207">She had it on the back of her bicycle.</span> <span id="s1208">When she got to the cottage she put the chicken in the lettuce.</span> <span id="s1209">The poor thing couldn’t walk.</span> <span id="s1210">So we stayed there and I became acquainted with the neighbors.</span> <span id="s1211">You couldn’t help but get acquainted, especially with the school principal and his wife.</span> <span id="s1212">They were older people and they were very nice.</span> <span id="s1213">He went hunting.</span> <span id="s1214">They took me in like a daughter, really, they were very nice people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">I stayed there for two months and then the bombings became too bad.</span> <span id="s1216">The bombing shifted to the outskirts of Berlin, and we had absolutely no shelters.</span> <span id="s1217">We had no basements.</span> <span id="s1218">We had nothing.</span> <span id="s1219">We were standing in the fields.</span> <span id="s1220">You could see the bomb runs.</span> <span id="s1221">When the planes came over, they dropped what we called Christmas trees.</span> <span id="s1222">These were the markers where the bombs were going to fall.</span> <span id="s1223">Then the German planes went up and tried to fight them.</span> <span id="s1224">then came the flag (the Fliegerabwehr i.e. antiaircraft guns) and they had the air fights.</span> <span id="s1225">As it happened, it was always directly over us.</span> <span id="s1226">When the allied bombers reached the point they were supposed to reach, of course they dropped the bombs.</span> <span id="s1227">You know they wanted to get rid of them before they went home.</span> <span id="s1228">So it came to a point that it was impossible, you know, no shelter, no nothing, these air fights going on, the bombing going on.</span> <span id="s1229">It was getting to be something which was almost impossible to bear.</span> <span id="s1230">It was also getting to be harder and harder to get back and forth, even when going with the train, thought it was only one hour from Berlin.</span> <span id="s1231">It was hard to go there and I couldn’t get my food.</span> <span id="s1232">so I knew that I had to go back.</span> <span id="s1233">There was just no way that we could stay there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">So I decided to go back to Frau Winneman my first landlady because by now it was pretty clear that the war was lost (for Germany).</span> <span id="s1235">They had started drafting men fifty-five years old and kids like sixteen years old.</span> <span id="s1236">We heard from the people coming back from Russia.</span> <span id="s1237">It was pathetic, the way they looked.</span> <span id="s1238">You knew it was just about hopeless.</span> <span id="s1239">So I decided to go to my first landlady, Mrs. Winneman.</span> <span id="s1240">I had not been in touch with Herr Kreutzig at all.</span> <span id="s1241">I didn’t know whether he was traveling, whether he didn’t have the time or what.</span> <span id="s1242">So I went to her in spite of the fact that Emil was very much against it.</span> <span id="s1243">I told him that I didn’t care, that I had it up to here now, I am going back to her.</span> <span id="s1244">I am going to tell her the truth and I am going to see whether she will keep me anyway.</span> <span id="s1245">So I went to Berlin and I talked to her and I said “Hey, listen, this is the story.</span> <span id="s1246">I am a Jew.</span> <span id="s1247">I have been hiding all this time.</span> <span id="s1248">I am not Mr. Kreutzig’s niece.</span> <span id="s1249">I am in your hands, whatever.</span> <span id="s1250">So what you want.”</span> <span id="s1251">She said, “Look, you are one of the family, you come here, you stay here, that’s it.</span> <span id="s1252">Of course I guess she figured that it wouldn’t be bad either if I would be there at the end of the war.</span> <span id="s1253">Now she knew too that the war was ending.</span> <span id="s1254">So I moved back!</span> <span id="s1255">Now she was a little better prepared to deal with that gentile German neighbor woman (who had been making a nuisance of herself).</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">Emil came by and he looked in this little room there anyway.</span> <span id="s1257">I stayed home and I forget what story we made up for the people.</span> <span id="s1258">No, I remember now, we didn’t make up any excuse; I stayed in the back room all day long.</span> <span id="s1259">I didn’t come out, I didn’t go out into the store anymore like I used to and I still pretended as if I was working.</span> <span id="s1260">I just used to show up at night.</span> <span id="s1261">I thought that I almost had it made to lay low for the time, but this German neighbor woman put her two cents in again.</span> <span id="s1262">I had known a man from the neighborhood who had tried to pick me up lots of time.</span> <span id="s1263">I always kind of put him off.</span> <span id="s1264">He had a big (Nazi) party sign on his door.</span> <span id="s1265">This neighbor woman came in and she told my landlady that this man had been asking questions about me and that she thought that he was Gestapo.</span> <span id="s1266">That was a big lie.</span> <span id="s1267">However, I said to Frau Winneman, “I have got to get out of here because I am not going to endanger your life and Karen’s life!”</span> <span id="s1268">I was particularly fond of Karen and of her.</span> <span id="s1269">They may have been low class people, but they were good hearted people and they were nice to me.</span> <span id="s1270">I added.</span> <span id="s1271">“I am going to get out of here.</span> <span id="s1272">I kind of doubt that that fellow is Gestapo, but I am going to take the bull by the horn and I am going over to his apartment.”</span> <span id="s1273">I did.</span> <span id="s1274">I asked him, “Have you been asking a lot of questions about me?</span> <span id="s1275">Now what is the story?”</span> <span id="s1276">he said, “Well, nothing”.</span> <span id="s1277">He just wanted to ask about me.</span> <span id="s1278">He was “interested.”</span> <span id="s1279">So I said, “Well you got me in a lot of trouble because I can’t afford to be asked about.</span> <span id="s1280">This is why: I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s1281">I am hiding out!</span> <span id="s1282">This has spoiled it for me!</span> <span id="s1283">I can’t stay where I am and I haven’t got another place yet.”</span> <span id="s1284">He says, “Well, you can stay here for awhile.”</span> <span id="s1285">“OK” “For a price.”</span> <span id="s1286">I still had some heavy gold watches.</span> <span id="s1287">He seemed very willing to take them.</span> <span id="s1288">this man turned out to be a complete pervert.</span> <span id="s1289">People were going in and out.</span> <span id="s1290">The weirdest people you have ever seen!</span> <span id="s1291">It was just wild!</span> <span id="s1292">Everybody coming in said “Heil Hitler!”</span> <span id="s1293">I had never heard that, so I thought, “I can’t stay here either.”</span> <span id="s1294">So one night I went over to Frau Winneman and I said; “Hey, I don’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s1295">I can’t stay there either.”</span> <span id="s1296">So, again, I was extremely lucky!</span> <span id="s1297">A friend of hers showed up, an old school friend who was a widow who lived in the East part of Berlin.</span> <span id="s1298">She lived by herself, a very nice person, a Social Democrat, real old fashioned, you know, union people.</span> <span id="s1299">You know, like they are here, strong left leaning affiliation.</span> <span id="s1300">We decided to tell her the story.</span> <span id="s1301">What can we do?</span> <span id="s1302">This can’t go on much longer!</span> <span id="s1303">She said, “Pack your things, come with me!”</span> <span id="s1304">We went out to her place and I stayed with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">By this time the bombings were day and night, all the time.</span> <span id="s1306">We stayed in the bunker.</span> <span id="s1307">We met people.</span> <span id="s1308">People started talking.</span> <span id="s1309">We met some German soldiers who did turn out to be from Alsace-Loraine (the French provinces on the left bank of the Rhine which Germany annexed in 1870 and, again in 1940), really French all the way, just biding their time, trying to pick the right moment to desert and get in with the French prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s1310">So we were just waiting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">By now we knew that the Russians and the Americans were stopped on either side of Berlin.</span> <span id="s1312">We were thinking that the Americans would come in.</span> <span id="s1313">We were positive that the Americans would come in from the West, and the Russians from the East.</span> <span id="s1314">Since we were living in the East, were we going to see the first Russians?</span> <span id="s1315">That was a frightening sight.</span> <span id="s1316">These Russians would scare the hell lout of you.</span> <span id="s1317">I mean they just looked scary, that’s all.</span> <span id="s1318">So they came and we knew that the battle would occur pretty soon.</span> <span id="s1319">We heard shooting in the distance already.</span> <span id="s1320">We saw the prisoners of war, everything was bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">My old landlady, Frau Winneman, called me from the West.</span> <span id="s1322">She said, “Hey, this is going to be the end, I wish you could come back here, because I don’t want to be alone with Karen.”</span> <span id="s1323">Well, I couldn’t blame her, alone with a little girl!</span> <span id="s1324">I owed her so much, so I said “OK, I am going back there.”</span> <span id="s1325">By this time nothing is running in Berlin.</span> <span id="s1326">No trolleys, no nothing, but a lot of cars.</span> <span id="s1327">All the big shots, army, SS, SA, party officials, in their cars taking off to the West, getting out of Berlin, getting the hell over into the American territory, hopefully, so I hitched a ride.</span> <span id="s1328">It took me about five hours to get through the city and to Heiligensee.</span> <span id="s1329">I went with a bunch of big shot Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">By this time, I had nothing of value left, I don’t remember if I took a suitcase.</span> <span id="s1331">I believe I had a small bag and I had about three rings left, about three diamond rings which were worth something.</span> <span id="s1332">But, while going from car to car I managed to lose them.</span> <span id="s1333">So I had nothing.</span> <span id="s1334">I got to Frau Winneman’s with the clothes on my back, and that was all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">Then the bombing started in earnest.</span> <span id="s1336">We heard artillery all day long and we moved after a couple of days the beds and all our belongings into the basement.</span> <span id="s1337">.</span> <span id="s1338">We couldn’t go into the bunker anymore, because by now we had the Russian planes also.</span> <span id="s1339">You see they had the Russian fighter planes.</span> <span id="s1340">They came down really low and threw firebombs.</span> <span id="s1341">By that time, the stores were mostly closed and you had to go and stand in line to get bread or milk, or whatever, that is, with your ration tickets.</span> <span id="s1342">So the Russian planes came over and machine-gunned the people who were standing in the lines.</span> <span id="s1343">People were laying all over the streets, you know dead, and nobody came to take them away.</span> <span id="s1344">They just put paper over them.</span> <span id="s1345">Here you would see an arm sticking out, there you’d see a leg sticking out.</span> <span id="s1346">You know, you have that constant artillery in the background and you don’t know, in the basement.</span> <span id="s1347">They were just trying to get through it.</span> <span id="s1348">(the bombardment).</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">The funny part was that this guy showed up.</span> <span id="s1350">The guy I spend a couple of nights with, that pervert, and he says, “Now look, I just want to remind you of the time I helped you.</span> <span id="s1351">You know, when things go wrong my name is.”</span> <span id="s1352">I thought “OK.”</span> <span id="s1353">So we stayed in the basement and we would have been OK.</span> <span id="s1354">but, just maybe two weeks before the whole thing was over, the house was finally bombed.</span> <span id="s1355">We had to get out of the basement.</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">We got the little girl, of course, and we got most of her things.</span> <span id="s1357">That was the main thing.</span> <span id="s1358">We got as much food as we could and we wound up in the apartment house kiddy corner from the one we used to live in.</span> <span id="s1359">That was the house where that nosy neighbor lady lived.</span> <span id="s1360">We then stayed in that basement.</span> <span id="s1361">We were living there.</span> <span id="s1362">There was a young pharmacist and another young girl and several other people, we were all living there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">Then people started turning the SD (Schutz Dienst) i.e. protective service, i.e. a paramilitary unit set up by the Nazis) out.</span> <span id="s1364">When the German soldiers came in, nobody wanted them in.</span> <span id="s1365">Everybody said “Get out!</span> <span id="s1366">find another place.”</span> <span id="s1367">“We don’t want any soldiers here!</span> <span id="s1368">No Nazis!”</span> <span id="s1369">One crazy guy, one diehard Nazi decided to go on the 4th floor of the apartment building with a machine gun.</span> <span id="s1370">He started shooting out of a window.</span> <span id="s1371">In front of the house there already was a Russian tank.</span> <span id="s1372">So he started shooting with a machine gun.</span> <span id="s1373">Of course, they were going to blow us to kingdom come.</span> <span id="s1374">So, finally some guys managed to get rid of him and get the gun away from him.</span> <span id="s1375">We all sat in the basement while we were waiting for the shooting to stop.</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">Goebbels was still talking over the radio.</span> <span id="s1377">“We are going to hold Berlin and our Volksturm (the peoples defense forces), you know the 75 year old men without teeth and shaking all over, are going to fight to the death.</span> <span id="s1378">We are going to win!”</span> <span id="s1379">The food was getting so scarce that when a horse fell down in the street -- (now I had eaten enough horse meat during the war, we had it in the country because it was available without ration stamps), -- but his was not a horse which had been slaughtered.</span> <span id="s1380">We ran between the bombings with a knife to cut a piece of meat and cook it, because you knew you are hungry and you had to eat.</span> <span id="s1381">That was it.</span> <span id="s1382">That was the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">One day the shooting kind of stopped and that was it.</span> <span id="s1384">Then we were afraid to come out of the basement, because we didn’t know what was up there.</span> <span id="s1385">So then we went up there, of course.</span> <span id="s1386">I, stupid me, I am so glad that the war is over.</span> <span id="s1387">I made it!</span> <span id="s1388">Oh boy, the Russians are here.</span> <span id="s1389">We didn’t know if they are Americans, didn’t know if they are Russians.</span> <span id="s1390">We hoped that they are Americans!</span> <span id="s1391">But anything is better than the Germans!</span> <span id="s1392">My neighbor, the White Russian taught me the phrase: “I am not German, I am Jewish!”</span> <span id="s1393">in Russian.</span> <span id="s1394">I learned it!</span> <span id="s1395">So, OK.</span> <span id="s1396">Fine.</span> <span id="s1397">We go out in the street, we see the Russian soldiers with machine guns going around, you know.</span> <span id="s1398">So we went back into the basement.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">The Russians came in waves and waves.</span> <span id="s1400">All the Germans, all the German women!</span> <span id="s1401">That was the big word “Frau-Komm!”</span> <span id="s1402">that meant come on, female.</span> <span id="s1403">Rapings happened all over the place.</span> <span id="s1404">Most of them were drunk when they came in.</span> <span id="s1405">They were drunk like skunks.</span> <span id="s1406">When they were in a good mood, they just raped the women and when they were in a bad mood, they shot the whole place to hell.</span> <span id="s1407">They just shot around.</span> <span id="s1408">You can’t imagine.</span> <span id="s1409">I saw apartments afterwards, nice apartments in which the Russian soldiers had been in.</span> <span id="s1410">You wouldn’t believe it, but everything was shot up, telephones were ripped out.</span> <span id="s1411">They took things which they thought they could use.</span> <span id="s1412">They were so far behind in their technology and everything.</span> <span id="s1413">They used any place in the house as a bathroom.</span> <span id="s1414">They probably didn’t have any at home.</span> <span id="s1415">They probably didn’t know what a W.C. was.</span> <span id="s1416">It was just perfectly disgusting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">First, when I was so ignorant and carefree and happy, you remember, and I tried to talk to them.</span> <span id="s1418">first, I got my share of rapings, and afterwards I got wise to it.</span> <span id="s1419">We had a great big wardrobe in the basement and all of the women we hid behind there.</span> <span id="s1420">The men kind of positioned it in a way that it looked as if it was right along the wall.</span> <span id="s1421">They just left a few of the older women up front.</span> <span id="s1422">They took the old women too, of course, but they were not in as much danger as we were.</span> <span id="s1423">So we hid behind there for about three days, because things happened which were so bad like a fourteen year old girl being raped by about twenty of them, and the father standing there.</span> <span id="s1424">The only one nobody touched was my landlady Frau Winneman.</span> <span id="s1425">She was dying for guys!</span> <span id="s1426">She was always dying for guys and she sat right in front and so help me, nobody ever touched her.</span> <span id="s1427">I never could get over that!</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">So that was the end of the war!</span> <span id="s1429">That was when the Russians settled down.</span> <span id="s1430">We were very disappointed with the allies that they didn’t send us the Americans or the British or somebody else civilized.</span> <span id="s1431">But they didn’t.</span> <span id="s1432">We had curfews.</span> <span id="s1433">We lived with the Russians.</span> <span id="s1434">We had to be off the streets at 8:00 P.M. I moved in with another German girl and we were very careful, because the Russians were still dragging every woman off the street.</span> <span id="s1435">They stole every watch.</span> <span id="s1436">They had a thing about a watch, that is what they wanted, watches and money!</span> <span id="s1437">Anybody with a watch.</span> <span id="s1438">“Uhr!</span> <span id="s1439">Uhr!</span> <span id="s1440">Uhr!</span> <span id="s1441">“ (The German for watch is Uhr).</span> <span id="s1442">They didn’t know how to tell time!</span> <span id="s1443">One guy called me over on the street once and wanted me to show him how to read a watch, which he had stolen.</span> <span id="s1444">They stayed about, I guess, one month until they set up the division of Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">The second ones were the Canadians, who came in.</span> <span id="s1446">The Canadians, of course, that was heaven.</span> <span id="s1447">They stayed for a little longer.</span> <span id="s1448">They went around and gave candies, and gave cigarettes and were nice.</span> <span id="s1449">The German girl I lived with, of course couldn’t speak a word of English, but she had a Canadian boyfriend right away.</span> <span id="s1450">He left after two weeks and of course she had a little souvenir; she was pregnant.</span> <span id="s1451">I told her that she was going to have a terrible time because the kid is not going to understand German and how was she going to talk to it in English.</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">Q: Did you speak English?</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">A: Oh yes!</span> <span id="s1454">I had learned in school.</span> <span id="s1455">I had learned several languages.</span> <span id="s1456">So that was it.</span> <span id="s1457">Then that was it and the Canadians left, and we had the British come in.</span> <span id="s1458">the British were quite another story.</span> <span id="s1459">They were really very proper.</span> <span id="s1460">Before they picked up the girls, they questioned them whether they went to church every time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">Q: It was all right then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">A: Yes, that made it OK.</span> <span id="s1463">When, finally, they left, thank God, then the Americans came and finally, order came.</span> <span id="s1464">Then everything became established.</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">Q: It was all so interesting that I would like you to continue about why you came to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">A: OK.</span> <span id="s1467">So I still lived with that German girl who was getting a little heavy around the stomach.</span> <span id="s1468">She was kind of dumb, but she was a good girl.</span> <span id="s1469">We used to go swimming.</span> <span id="s1470">We had nothing to do.</span> <span id="s1471">There was no work or anything like that.</span> <span id="s1472">So we kind of helped each other out.</span> <span id="s1473">We got some ration tickets.</span> <span id="s1474">We got some food from the allies then.</span> <span id="s1475">So we went swimming and we were swimming one afternoon on one lake out there in Gruenwaldt when a jeep came by and I saw my first Americans.</span> <span id="s1476">Two guys jumped out and they wanted to find the way to somewhere.</span> <span id="s1477">So we told them the way and later on we found that they knew that way well, since they picked up the mail every day there!</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">However, that was the very first American I had met.</span> <span id="s1479">Bill McDaniel, is the one who brought me over to this country.</span> <span id="s1480">He was a mail clerk in the First Army.</span> <span id="s1481">We became acquainted and I told him about myself.</span> <span id="s1482">He said: “Hey, do you want a job?”</span> <span id="s1483">I said, “Sure!”</span> <span id="s1484">So he said, “Well, OK.</span> <span id="s1485">We can use somebody who speaks some English, and knows something about selling.”</span> <span id="s1486">So, since my father was in the retail business, he took me to his commanding officer and they requisitioned.</span> <span id="s1487">Now the Americans “requisitioned”, they didn’t steal.</span> <span id="s1488">The Russians “stole”, the Americans “requisitioned”.</span> <span id="s1489">These two are the same thing, of course, but who is going to argue the point.</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">They had me set up a tailor shop for them.</span> <span id="s1491">I hired three German women for them and we set up a little room with an ironing board and a sewing machine.</span> <span id="s1492">I could interpret.</span> <span id="s1493">The G.I.’s came and had their uniforms either pressed or if the pants needed to be taken up or the sleeves or the stripes sewn up, collar fixed or whatever -- they came in and they told me what they wanted done.</span> <span id="s1494">I told the old ladies what they wanted done.</span> <span id="s1495">I usually slept there since there was a big table here, so that was OK.</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">Q: Were the old ladies paid?</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">A: Yes, by the German government, not by the Americans.</span> <span id="s1498">I don’t know if it was the city government or the Reich government.</span> <span id="s1499">The German government paid us, but I don’t know from what pocket.</span> <span id="s1500">Then the First Army left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">In the meantime, a cousin of my mother’s came to Berlin from here -- from the States.</span> <span id="s1502">He had been in the States for years, long before Hitler.</span> <span id="s1503">He was one of the black sheeps in the family, whom they all chipped in and bought a one-way ticket and said; “Go to America!”</span> <span id="s1504">So he came back as a War Department employee with an equivalent officer’s rank and a fancy uniform.</span> <span id="s1505">I guess that he was about fifty and he never had had too much money here.</span> <span id="s1506">He was from Queens, N.Y. where he had a wife and three kids.</span> <span id="s1507">He was living over there, in an elegant villa.</span> <span id="s1508">He had a German girlfriend.</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">Anyway, he came to hunt for me at the request of my sister.</span> <span id="s1510">My sister had written him a letter.</span> <span id="s1511">In that letter she wanted to know what was left of the house and of me and my cousins and all that.</span> <span id="s1512">This cousin of my mother’s worked in a part where the Americans were hiring Germans to check the mail which was going out of the country or coming into the country so as to see just what was being said.</span> <span id="s1513">Everything was still being censored.</span> <span id="s1514">They hired a lot of Germans to do that and the German government paid for it.</span> <span id="s1515">So when the group left where I had that tailor shop, my second cousin got me a job up there where he worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">Since I could understand English very well, and I didn’t have to sit there and do that lettering.</span> <span id="s1517">They put me in the supply room with a G.I. I worked with a sergeant Eddy Homesen (or something close to that).</span> <span id="s1518">He was a big fat guy from Chicago.</span> <span id="s1519">Of course, I could understand English, but I was not very fluent in it and I didn’t know that colloquialisms.</span> <span id="s1520">He answered the phone: “Sergeant Homesen” and I thought that when he was gone that is what I was supposed to say.</span> <span id="s1521">So I said “Sergeant Homesen” and they came back, “My, your voice has changed!”</span> <span id="s1522">They were kidding, and they taught me to curse, to say things that were really fierce.</span> <span id="s1523">I didn’t know what I was saying.</span> <span id="s1524">They were great to me, all the guys were great to me, but they really taught me to curse.</span> <span id="s1525">When I came over here, I thought the M.P. would drop his teeth when I let loose.</span> <span id="s1526">I had no idea what I was saying.</span></p> <p><span id="s1527">Anyway, this guy whom I had met, Bill McDaniel, and had set up this tailor shop, he had gone home when his turn came up, he wanted me to come over here.</span> <span id="s1528">We were supposed to get married -- and he did get over here.</span> <span id="s1529">You know, I worked for the Americans in Weimar.</span> <span id="s1530">He wrote me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">Q: What happened to Emil?</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">A: You see I forget when I don’t write things down.</span> <span id="s1533">Emil got caught.</span> <span id="s1534">He got killed.</span> <span id="s1535">We met when I moved back to Frau Winneman’s.</span> <span id="s1536">We met every afternoon at a certain spot.</span> <span id="s1537">He would bring me food and everything.</span> <span id="s1538">We would talk and we would cheer each other up.</span> <span id="s1539">One day he didn’t show up.</span> <span id="s1540">I waited and the next day he didn’t show up either.</span> <span id="s1541">So I knew that something was wrong, and I went to his boss and he hadn’t shown up.</span> <span id="s1542">So I had his boss call his landlady and all his things were there.</span> <span id="s1543">The only thing which really got me, he had a gun.</span> <span id="s1544">He had bought himself a gun, a revolver, and he had said that whenever he gets caught he at least would take someone with him, that he would not go without a struggle.</span> <span id="s1545">At the time he was caught, he did not have the revolver with him.</span> <span id="s1546">So I did assume that he was killed instantly, because, after the war, they had places where you could check up on people to see what happened to them, on the ones who came back from the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1547">I had one year after the war to check on him.</span> <span id="s1548">He was killed.</span> <span id="s1549">He was killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">Q: You were talking about working with the U.S, army.</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">A: Yes, I enjoyed working with the Americans.</span> <span id="s1552">I worked in the supply room and I learned a lot of things.</span> <span id="s1553">I particularly learned English, which helped me a lot.</span> <span id="s1554">I also learned a lot about the behavior of Americans, which was a great help.</span> <span id="s1555">I corresponded with Bill and he was trying to get me out of Germany and I was trying to leave.</span> <span id="s1556">All the people I worked with also tried to help me get out!</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">The one officer who was in charge for a while, Captain Sargent, became the consul or something like that.</span> <span id="s1558">I went to see him and I was considered a “Displaced Person”, at least I called myself a Displaced Person.</span> <span id="s1559">They said, “Where were you born?”</span> <span id="s1560">I said, “In Berlin.”</span> <span id="s1561">They said, “Why are you displaced?”</span> <span id="s1562">Well, anyway, between what they did for me -- the officers I worked for -- and Bill, from Iowa, they got me a visa to come over here.</span> <span id="s1563">Bill paid the ticket for me.</span> <span id="s1564">I was here barely after the war was over.</span> <span id="s1565">I came over on the second boat, because they were all working to get me here, that is, all the guys I was working for.</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">Q: Where did you leave from?</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">A: From Bremerhaven.</span> <span id="s1568">We had to be in a camp for two weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">Q: A Displaced Persons Camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1570">A: No.</span> <span id="s1571">It was a camp in preparation mostly I guess to check that you did not have any contagious diseases, or other illnesses.</span> <span id="s1572">We were questioned.</span> <span id="s1573">I was questioned by the CIC (the outfit which was later renamed the CIA).</span> <span id="s1574">They questioned us very closely and one had to show proof who one was and what one was, because at that time they were very strict as to who came over here, especially right after the war.</span> <span id="s1575">So I went through all of that questioning, but it was a big help that I had worked with the American army, and they (my former employers) could help me in a lot of ways.</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">We stayed in Bremerhaven and we embarked on a troop transport to come over.</span> <span id="s1577">It was no luxury ship.</span> <span id="s1578">The troop transport was called the S.S. Marine Flasher.</span> <span id="s1579">I got to the U.S. on June 26, 1945.</span> <span id="s1580">The boat was marvelous (according to my memory).</span> <span id="s1581">Boy, that food!</span> <span id="s1582">I hadn’t seen any food (without rationing) since 1936.</span> <span id="s1583">Everyone was seasick except this one girl I met on the boat and I, and we ate “like there was no tomorrow.”</span> <span id="s1584">Wow!</span> <span id="s1585">That food!</span> <span id="s1586">Oh that was the very best thing of the whole trip.</span> <span id="s1587">We hadn’t seen anything like that!</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">Q: Were there any G.I’s on the ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">A: No, no just Displaced Persons and such.</span> <span id="s1590">There were mostly Jews, some Germans who had been political prisoners and people like that.</span> <span id="s1591">That was all.</span> <span id="s1592">I had a visa not from any organization.</span> <span id="s1593">I had a private visa from Bill.</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">Q: Was Bill there to pick you up?</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">A: That was messed up.</span> <span id="s1596">They did not notify him of my scheduled arrival.</span> <span id="s1597">I spent about four days in New York with a Jewish organization which picked me up and tried to talk me out of going to Iowa.</span> <span id="s1598">As it turned out, they were right.</span> <span id="s1599">I shouldn’t have gone, but I didn’t know that then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">Q: How did you get to that Jewish organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">A: They met all the boats and they took care of anybody who was not met by somebody.</span> <span id="s1602">They took anybody who was left over and put them up in a hotel.</span> <span id="s1603">We landed in New York on the night of a big fight.</span> <span id="s1604">Some great boxers were fighting.</span> <span id="s1605">So, New York was just jammed packed.</span> <span id="s1606">We were taken from the boat to a hotel and on the way we were stopped by people who asked, “Do you know where we can get a hotel room!”</span> <span id="s1607">It was just impossible to find a place in New York.</span> <span id="s1608">Bill came after about four days with his sister and brother-in-law.</span> <span id="s1609">I had met the brother-in-law overseas also.</span> <span id="s1610">He was stationed in Berlin too.</span> <span id="s1611">They took me to Iowa.</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">Q: Can you talk about Iowa?</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">A: No!</span> <span id="s1614">Not in any detail.</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">Q: We are interested in your adaptation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">A: All right!</span> <span id="s1617">When I told the guys in Berlin where I was going, especially Captain Sargent, they asked me “Where are you going?”</span> <span id="s1618">I said “Newton, Iowa!”</span> <span id="s1619">Captain Sargent and others had an absolutely hysterical fit!</span> <span id="s1620">He said, ‘I am going to show you a map.”</span> <span id="s1621">He said, ‘you were born here in Berlin and you lived here.</span> <span id="s1622">You will never make it in Newton, Iowa!”</span> <span id="s1623">I said, “Well, I am going.</span> <span id="s1624">Bill is waiting!</span> <span id="s1625">I love him!</span> <span id="s1626">He is cute as a button!</span> <span id="s1627">He is wonderful to me.</span> <span id="s1628">He sent me clothes.</span> <span id="s1629">He is a nice guy!”</span> <span id="s1630">We went, first of all, by car with his sister and brother-in-law.</span> <span id="s1631">I couldn’t get over the American customs.</span> <span id="s1632">She had pin curls all over when I met her.</span> <span id="s1633">So I thought “Oh, my God!”</span> <span id="s1634">She wore jeans.</span> <span id="s1635">So I thought “Oh Lord!</span> <span id="s1636">What is that?”</span> <span id="s1637">All the old ladies in New York with the red hats and the yellow hats and the flowers, and the bright red lipstick and the nail polish.</span> <span id="s1638">You know that is how loose women looked in Germany!</span> <span id="s1639">I know that in Germany they would have been Madams, or something like that.</span> <span id="s1640">Especially with the blue hair.</span> <span id="s1641">All the girls in jeans!</span></p> <p><span id="s1642">We went to Niagara Falls on our way to Newton, Iowa and there we had quite an experience.</span> <span id="s1643">They wanted to see the falls from the Canadian side also.</span> <span id="s1644">They had never been there.</span> <span id="s1645">So we went.</span> <span id="s1646">There is that long bridge (probably the Rainbow Bridge).</span> <span id="s1647">The Americans let us out without any difficulties.</span> <span id="s1648">The Canadians asked everybody “Where were you born?”</span> <span id="s1649">(That is always what the question is at any crossing into Canada since all those who are not U.S. or British citizens need a visa to enter Canada.</span> <span id="s1650">Those who are not native born U.S. citizens have to prove U’s; citizenship upon request).</span></p> <p><span id="s1651">“Newton, Iowa, where were you born?”</span> <span id="s1652">Washington, Iowa, were you born?”</span> <span id="s1653">Berlin, Germany, come on out!”</span> <span id="s1654">So in there (in the Canadian custom house) they questioned me.</span> <span id="s1655">They saw my papers.</span> <span id="s1656">“No way are you going to go into Canada!”</span> <span id="s1657">They think that I am a German spy.</span> <span id="s1658">(Actually what The Canadians were concerned about was illegal immigration).</span> <span id="s1659">“No way are you going into Canada!”</span> <span id="s1660">They scared me to death by telling the people who couldn’t come in because of failure to prove U.S. citizenship to the satisfaction of the Canadians that the U.S. border guards would not let them back into the U.S. I was crying.</span> <span id="s1661">I was hysterical.</span> <span id="s1662">They kept me for one hour.</span> <span id="s1663">Then they let me loose.</span> <span id="s1664">They said, ‘OK, you go on back and you will be lucky if the Americans will let you back in!”</span> <span id="s1665">because supposedly I only had a visa not permanent residency.</span></p> <p><span id="s1666">I was ready to jump off the bridge!</span> <span id="s1667">I just could see myself being on that bridge forever, you know, between the two border guards.</span> <span id="s1668">So they gave me a note to hand to the Americans.</span> <span id="s1669">I don’t know what it said, probably “This is a German spy, don’t let her in!”</span> <span id="s1670">So, at the American station, I handed them the note.</span> <span id="s1671">They said, “Come on in.”</span> <span id="s1672">So I sat there and he says, “How long have you been in the U.S.?”</span> <span id="s1673">I said, “Ten days.”</span> <span id="s1674">So he said, “but I think that you have plenty of time to see Canada, why don’t you see the U.S. first!</span> <span id="s1675">Have a good time!”</span> <span id="s1676">The U.S. border guard was just great, but I was just afraid.</span> <span id="s1677">You know that that comes after so many years of being afraid of anyone wearing a uniform or even part of a uniform or even talking with any authority.</span> <span id="s1678">It was terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1679">So we got to Newton, Iowa.</span> <span id="s1680">I was waiting for Newton, Iowa, you can imagine.</span> <span id="s1681">We passed a little town, that is a little town square and two pigs and one movie.</span> <span id="s1682">So I said, “where is Newton, Iowa?”</span> <span id="s1683">They said, “We just drove through it!”</span> <span id="s1684">And so it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1685">Then I met the family and found out that Bill had told nobody that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1686">Besides that, Jews are not too well liked in Newton, Iowa.</span> <span id="s1687">There are exactly eight Jewish families and nobody would socialize with them, I believe to this day.</span> <span id="s1688">The Jewish families own stores and stuff and sent their kids away to school.</span> <span id="s1689">So Bill hadn’t told anybody that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1690">He told them that I was a French girl.</span> <span id="s1691">However, the problem was that there was a real French girl living in that place.</span> <span id="s1692">I was scared to death that I would be running into her, because I couldn’t talk French that well at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1693">His mother and father were good people, nice people, but they were just as scared of me as I was of them.</span> <span id="s1694">His mother told me later on that she thought that anyone from Europe had two heads or something.</span> <span id="s1695">I mean she didn’t know!</span> <span id="s1696">I mean that she was the sweetest thing.</span> <span id="s1697">We became finally acquainted and I liked her a lot.</span> <span id="s1698">We kept in touch for a number of years.</span> <span id="s1699">I told her that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1700">They were Methodists.</span> <span id="s1701">You know, the mother had more sense than all of the kids put together.</span> <span id="s1702">The kids thought that she didn’t know that they drank and smoked.</span> <span id="s1703">I told her that I did.</span> <span id="s1704">“You know, my religion has nothing against it.”</span> <span id="s1705">She said, ‘I know that they do it.</span> <span id="s1706">They just think that I don’t know.”</span> <span id="s1707">Anyway, I couldn’t handle it.</span> <span id="s1708">Being in Newton, Iowa!</span> <span id="s1709">Such a small town!</span> <span id="s1710">So I left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1711">Q: Were you married?</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">A: No, we didn’t get married.</span> <span id="s1713">No, I couldn’t see it and he had been seeing another girl while I was still in Germany.</span> <span id="s1714">I thought that our life styles were so different that it wouldn’t have worked out.</span> <span id="s1715">We,, we didn’t break up completely.</span> <span id="s1716">I took a job in a tailor shop in Newton, Iowa.</span> <span id="s1717">This guy, I talked to him, he seemed an OK guy.</span> <span id="s1718">I told him, “I can’t live like this.”</span> <span id="s1719">So he told me: “Well, this one is a Jewish person.</span> <span id="s1720">Go talk to him.”</span> <span id="s1721">So I did talk to this one man and he said, “You don’t have a chance as a Jew, and you’ll make this man miserable.</span> <span id="s1722">Get out!”</span> <span id="s1723">So they collected, I think $38, for me to buy a ticket to return to New York, so I left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">Q: You went back to New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">A: I went to New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s1726">Q: What kind of contacts did you make in New York?</span> <span id="s1727">Just getting a job?</span></p> <p><span id="s1728">A: No, I didn’t stay in New York.</span> <span id="s1729">Thank God I met a girl I had been on the boat with and in Bremerhaven.</span> <span id="s1730">She was on the same train (heading to New York) that I was.</span> <span id="s1731">She was from Rochester, New York and I was coming from Iowa.</span> <span id="s1732">We met on the train.</span> <span id="s1733">She was very unhappy.</span> <span id="s1734">She was living with an 86 year-old uncle.</span> <span id="s1735">She was a nineteen-year old girl.</span> <span id="s1736">He was coming to New York for an operation.</span> <span id="s1737">He was a professor of Biblical Languages and a Methodist Minister.</span> <span id="s1738">He had converted, you know.</span> <span id="s1739">He had been born Jewish.</span> <span id="s1740">Anyway, she said that if she wasn’t going to stay with this uncle she wanted to stay with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1741">I was supposed to stay with somebody whom I knew from the boat who was supposed to have plenty of furnished rooms.</span> <span id="s1742">This man met me.</span> <span id="s1743">It was a man in his fifties.</span> <span id="s1744">I found out the first night that he didn’t have a room, but that he thought that it would be a good arrangement if I would stay with him.</span> <span id="s1745">So I spent one night in the chair and the next morning I called that girl and her uncle at their hotel.</span> <span id="s1746">We told her uncle, and I moved in with them.</span> <span id="s1747">I stayed with them in New York in the hotel while he had his operation, a cataract operation.</span> <span id="s1748">She told her uncle that either Helga is coming with us or I am staying with her, when he was making plans to leave New York City.</span> <span id="s1749">So I went with them to Florida where he had a place.</span> <span id="s1750">We stayed there for a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s1751">Q: Did you get a job in Florida?</span></p> <p><span id="s1752">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s1753">We got some jobs.</span> <span id="s1754">At first we stayed with the uncle.</span> <span id="s1755">One of the jobs we got was as chambermaids once.</span> <span id="s1756">That was in a little boardinghouse where they had a lot of old ladies.</span> <span id="s1757">People thought; ‘Oh boy, these girls are from Germany!</span> <span id="s1758">They will be really clean.”</span> <span id="s1759">We didn’t even know how to clean a house.</span> <span id="s1760">We went without a broom, just with a dust rag.</span> <span id="s1761">We had never cleaned anywhere before.</span> <span id="s1762">Then we left and went up to Jacksonville and took regular jobs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1763">Q: So by this time you felt that you had gotten acclimated?</span></p> <p><span id="s1764">A: Oh, I didn’t like the country at all at first.</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">Q: You had gotten the job and gotten along.</span></p> <p><span id="s1766">A: Yes, we were able to make a living then.</span> <span id="s1767">Yes, we did.</span> <span id="s1768">We worked in Jacksonville, both of us.</span> <span id="s1769">I worked in a store, a very nice dress store and she worked in another store.</span> <span id="s1770">We made out OK.</span></p> <p><span id="s1771">Q: Well, how did you come to Dayton?</span></p> <p><span id="s1772">A: This girl was going with a guy from Germany who had come from Germany to Cincinnati.</span> <span id="s1773">She eventually went to Cincinnati.</span> <span id="s1774">She wanted me to come to join her.</span> <span id="s1775">I went to Cincinnati.</span> <span id="s1776">She broke up with this guy.</span> <span id="s1777">I took up with him.</span> <span id="s1778">I married him and stayed in Cincinnati from then on most of my life.</span> <span id="s1779">Then I filed for divorce.</span> <span id="s1780">He went to Dayton, got another job here.</span> <span id="s1781">He talked me into dropping the divorce.</span> <span id="s1782">I came to Dayton with the kids and got stuck.</span> <span id="s1783">I finally got a divorce after all and got stuck here in Dayton.</span></p></body></html>
