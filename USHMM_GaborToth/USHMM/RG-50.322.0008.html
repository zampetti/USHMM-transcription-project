Farnbacher.</span></p> <p><span id="s5">Q: May I ask your age?</span></p> <p><span id="s6">A: I will be 61 on my next birthday.</span></p> <p><span id="s7">Q: Where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s8">A: In Augsburg (48.22N, 10.53E) in Bavaria, near Munich.</span> <span id="s9">Incidentally Augsburg is now a sister city of Dayton, I don’t know if you knew that.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">Q: No, I did not know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">A: There is a sister city of Dayton in Japan and one in Germany, and Augsburg happens to be the sister city in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Q: Did you grow up there?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A: I was born in 1923 and I lived there until 1936.</span> <span id="s14">So I was 13 years old when I went to England.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: What was Augsburg like?</span> <span id="s16">Was it a small town or a big town?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: No.</span> <span id="s18">Augsburg is very similar to Dayton.</span> <span id="s19">It is the second or third largest city in Bavaria.</span> <span id="s20">It is the capital of a county and at its center.</span> <span id="s21">It was formed by the Romans some 2,000 years ago.</span> <span id="s22">Next year will be their 2,000th anniversary.</span> <span id="s23">It is located on two streams, one of them is a big similar to Dayton.</span> <span id="s24">There are quite a few similarities and that is why they selected each other as sister cities, it does include the fact that NCR has a large plant there.</span> <span id="s25">They also make Messerschmitt airplanes in Augsburg, or rather they did; I don’t know if they still do.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: Was it an industrial city?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: Yes, it was a city with very heavy industry.</span> <span id="s28">I believe that it has about 200,000 inhabitants.</span> <span id="s29">That is a large city for Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: Did you have brothers and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: Yes, I have one brother.</span> <span id="s32">He also lives in Dayton, now.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: Is he younger than you?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: Yes, he is 2 years younger.</span> <span id="s35">He will be 59 this year.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: Did anyone else live in your home?</span> <span id="s37">Other relatives?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: My mother and father.</span> <span id="s39">My grandparents, on my mother’s side, were living in Augsburg at the time I left Germany.</span> <span id="s40">They were from another area of Germany, near Koblentz, that is near the Rhine River.</span> <span id="s41">(Koblentz is located 50.21N,7.36E) Things got very difficult there for Jewish people, so they came to live with us.</span> <span id="s42">They were also older so they were to the point that they were glad no longer to maintain a separate household.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: What language was spoken in your house?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: Oh, German!</span> <span id="s45">We didn’t know anything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: You didn’t learn any language in school?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: I mainly learned Latin in school.</span> <span id="s48">I went for 3 years to a Catholic Gymnasium.</span> <span id="s49">Incidentally that school sent its choir to Dayton several times.</span> <span id="s50">In any case, the main foreign language there is Latin because it is a Roman Catholic institution.</span> <span id="s51">I also had some private lessons in French, so I spoke some French, when I left Germany, no English, whatsoever.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: What kind of education did your parents have?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s54">I believe that my mother had a primary school education.</span> <span id="s55">Something like 4 years of grade school and 4 years of high school.</span> <span id="s56">I believe that at the time 8 years was the norm.</span> <span id="s57">My father had some additional training.</span> <span id="s58">He went to business school, then he was an officer in the German army in WWI.</span> <span id="s59">He owned a large business.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: What kind of business was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: It was a large wholesale merchandising company.</span> <span id="s62">He also owned two factories.</span> <span id="s63">One of them was making toys, the other one made belts and suspenders.</span> <span id="s64">That was owned by my father and his brother, my uncle.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: Did your mother work at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: No.</span> <span id="s67">She was very busy running two maids.</span> <span id="s68">It was like a business enterprise.</span> <span id="s69">She was in charge of taking care of the maids, the cook, and the seamstress, in other words running the household.</span> <span id="s70">In Germany, at that time, women did not usually work.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: Do you know how your father came to be in Augsburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: No, my mother is from Montebar (not certain of the spelling).</span> <span id="s73">That is the small town near Koblentz from where her parents came.</span> <span id="s74">My father’s family can be traced back prior to 1800 in Augsburg.</span> <span id="s75">How they got to Augsburg prior to that time I wouldn’t know.</span> <span id="s76">I believe that they founded their business about 1810.</span> <span id="s77">That was my great great grandfather.</span> <span id="s78">I have a picture incidentally of some of the people here.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: I would like to see these pictures sometime.</span> <span id="s80">So they were in Augsburg then for generations.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: Yes, I have records of their living in Augsburg prior to the year 1800.</span> <span id="s82">Naturally we have no information about anything prior to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: Was your family very religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: Were they more assimilated then?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: Well, in Germany, most of the Jews were not very religious.</span> <span id="s87">I don’t believe that we know any one who was what you call here Orthodox.</span> <span id="s88">I don’t remember anybody either Orthodox or Conservative.</span> <span id="s89">Everybody was pretty much like the Reformed group.</span> <span id="s90">They were, as you said, pretty much assimilated.</span> <span id="s91">They did not consider themselves different from the other Germans.</span> <span id="s92">They did not go to the Catholic church, the Dome.</span> <span id="s93">They went to Synagogue on Saturday not Sunday.</span> <span id="s94">That was the main difference.</span> <span id="s95">Our customs were pretty much like those of the rest of the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: Did you attend Synagogue regularly?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: Yes, usually at least until Bar Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s98">I believe that in order to prepare for Bar Mitzvah, we had to attend quite often and I believe that we usually went on Saturday morning.</span> <span id="s99">They didn’t do much on Friday nights, it was not like here where the main thing is on Friday night - at least it is for the Reformed Jews.</span> <span id="s100">Saturday morning was the main Service.</span> <span id="s101">We also always did go on the High Holy days.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: Did your family belong to groups connected with the Synagogue?</span> <span id="s103">Was the Synagogue the cultural or social center for that?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: I don’t believe so.</span> <span id="s105">I don’t know that they were.</span> <span id="s106">My parents just went there and they know that their friends went there.</span> <span id="s107">It did not assume the social function as it does here.</span> <span id="s108">It was a small, religious and educational organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: Did they join any outside clubs?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: Did they tend to go to the theatre or opera?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: Yes, to the opera.</span> <span id="s113">They liked the opera.</span> <span id="s114">Of course, and this again was very common in Germany, there actually was an opera in Augsburg, and they had a season through the fall.</span> <span id="s115">They went to most of the performances.</span> <span id="s116">I even went to some when I was 10 or 11 years old.</span> <span id="s117">We were generally told what the opera was all about, ahead of time so that we could follow the action, even if it was not in German.</span> <span id="s118">They also had concerts there.</span> <span id="s119">I think that there were cultural possibilities for most everyone.</span> <span id="s120">We didn’t listen to the news much and there was no other kind of entertainment.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: Do you recall much about your parents’ political affiliations?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: No.</span> <span id="s123">I really don’t.</span> <span id="s124">They were not active.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: Do you remember much about your early childhood?</span> <span id="s126">Before you started school.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: Very little.</span> <span id="s128">It has been a long time ago.</span> <span id="s129">I went to see my grandparents in Montebar near Koblentz, several times.</span> <span id="s130">We also used to go on vacations every year, and, that, I remember very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: Where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: Oh, to some nice places, such as in Italy, or Austria, in the Alps.</span> <span id="s133">We also went on winter vacations.</span> <span id="s134">We were not poor, we disposed of a lot of money.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: You said that you went to school in a Catholic school?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s137">After the first 4 years.</span> <span id="s138">There were 4 years of compulsory elementary school, similar to what we have.</span> <span id="s139">After these 4 years you didn’t have to go to school.</span> <span id="s140">Then you went to what you called: “Hochschule.”</span> <span id="s141">That corresponds to our high school, for 8 years, which is a public school, or you could go to private schools if you wanted better education.</span> <span id="s142">The best education in Augsburg, at that time was a Catholic Gymnasium.</span> <span id="s143">This was private and you paid tuition there.</span> <span id="s144">That school would prepare you to enter college.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: So for the first 4 years you went to public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s147">I was only there until I was 13, and for 3 years I went to that Catholic Gymnasium.</span> <span id="s148">The emphasis was on Latin and Algebra, mathematics, mostly academic subjects.</span> <span id="s149">Nothing at all in the way of vocational or practical skills.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: So you were preparing to enter college?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: Yes although I did not think that far ahead at the time.</span> <span id="s152">You know that is when Hitler started and there were other things to think about.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: Were there any overt expressions of anti-Semitism in either of these two schools?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s155">In the first 4 years from 1929 to 1933, there was not very much of Hitler.</span> <span id="s156">He came to power in 1932 and assumed power in 1933.</span> <span id="s157">As I left the public school, at the Catholic school which was called St. Stephan, there were some things.</span> <span id="s158">However, these things were mostly from public school students rather than from the people at the Catholic school.</span> <span id="s159">Hitler also persecuted the Catholic faith.</span> <span id="s160">The priests, the fathers, etc., were also under some pressure.</span> <span id="s161">Now, I should have said that Bavaria is 99 percent Catholic, one-half Jewish, one-half Protestant, so most people were Catholic.</span> <span id="s162">The people who went to the Gymnasium were less influenced by the church.</span> <span id="s163">The brothers and the priests, who were doing the teaching they were not going to preach race hatred, as the teachers in the public schools did.</span> <span id="s164">So anti-Semitism was less pronounced where I went to school, than it was in public schools.</span> <span id="s165">So the incidents were more likely to happen with students who were not in the gymnasium.</span> <span id="s166">However, I did hear things.</span> <span id="s167">I did leave in 1933, which was prior to when things got really bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: So you left the Catholic school in 1933?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: No, I started there in 1933 and I left in 1936 to go to England.</span> <span id="s170">My father had decided in 1935 that it was time to get out of Germany.</span> <span id="s171">He had come to the United States but he decided that we had to go somewhere else since the United States wouldn’t let Jews in (actually this means that the United States made no exceptions of the immigration laws in favor of the Jews).</span> <span id="s172">The next best thing they could think about was to send me and my brother to England to learn English, then they would get out themselves and then wait to go to the United States.</span> <span id="s173">That was the only way they could think to solve the problem.</span> <span id="s174">It turned out that that is how they saved our lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: So did you leave before the “Nuremberg Laws” came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: Oh yes!</span> <span id="s177">They just had a few laws when I was there.</span> <span id="s178">In 1936, things were not quite as difficult.</span> <span id="s179">The worst outbreak of violence started in 1938 when someone was shot.</span> <span id="s180">You may know more about it than I do.</span> <span id="s181">They called the first pogrom the Kristalnacht.</span> <span id="s182">At that time my father was interned.</span> <span id="s183">My brother was still there.</span> <span id="s184">They took away their maid.</span> <span id="s185">You had to give up all the jewelry and gold etc.</span> <span id="s186">For a while there was a permanent police in their apartment.</span> <span id="s187">My father was one of the leading citizens of the town, something like David Rike in Dayton.</span> <span id="s188">He had a very big business and everybody knew him.</span> <span id="s189">They did not take him to a concentration camp because of that; he had some friends who said: “You can’t take Mr. Farnbacher to a concentration camp.”</span> <span id="s190">So they interned him in his home, that was much better than what happened to anyone else, than to any of the people who went to concentration camps.</span> <span id="s191">A lot of the people never came back.</span> <span id="s192">At the time I was in England so I don’t know these things first hand.</span> <span id="s193">I just heard about it later.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: So you were in England?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: I was in England.</span> <span id="s196">I was only 13.</span> <span id="s197">I couldn’t speak English.</span> <span id="s198">That made it very difficult.</span> <span id="s199">My parents did some very tricky negotiations with the German government.</span> <span id="s200">My parents did some exporting of toys and leather goods and things, to the United States and to other countries.</span> <span id="s201">They said that if we could run this business with someone who knows English, we can export more.</span> <span id="s202">The German government was very hungry for foreign currency.</span> <span id="s203">They got someone to go along with this idea, so they could transfer the funds needed for my education.</span> <span id="s204">After a while the German government said “No, we are not going to do that!</span> <span id="s205">No funds.”</span> <span id="s206">Then the English Jewish community did help me by supporting me financially.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: You said that about 1935 your father had decided that it was time to leave Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s209">He was in the United States, actually in New York, and he saw that people here could say anything whereas in Germany things are limited.</span> <span id="s210">So he said: “We must leave.”</span> <span id="s211">He was partner with his brother, my uncle, in this big business.</span> <span id="s212">His brother said, “No, we are not going to do this, it is going to get better.”</span> <span id="s213">So my father said: “Well, you stay and we are leaving!”</span> <span id="s214">So he applied for visas for all of us.</span> <span id="s215">Of course there was a long wait; 4 years or so.</span> <span id="s216">My father, however said: “We have to get out of here.”</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: So your father did not have anything special during this trip?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: No, just seeing the United States and realizing how things were in Augsburg made him decide to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: When did you first become aware of Hitler?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: In 1932, just before he came to power.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: What were your thoughts then?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: I was very young then.</span> <span id="s223">I was about 9 years old.</span> <span id="s224">I don’t remember much.</span> <span id="s225">Maybe I thought: “Gee, I hope that this guy does not get elected.</span> <span id="s226">You see Hitler was elected by a possibly fraudulent vote.</span> <span id="s227">Everybody said that they voted against him, but somehow he had the majority.</span> <span id="s228">I believe that Hindenburg was President at the time.</span> <span id="s229">They threw everybody else out and they took over.</span> <span id="s230">I remember sometimes sitting up in our apartment.</span> <span id="s231">We had a very nice apartment.</span> <span id="s232">I showed you a picture of it.</span> <span id="s233">It was up high and was overlooking a beautiful park.</span> <span id="s234">We would see the NAZI’s down there, in their brown uniforms, searching up and down.</span> <span id="s235">They scared everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: Do you remember specifically what you were afraid of?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: Well, their coming, taking us prisoners and killing us.</span> <span id="s238">You know pretty much what they had in mind.</span> <span id="s239">They were going to take everything we had and kill us.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: I talked to several other people who, at the time were children.</span> <span id="s241">That is why I asked, because at times their perceptions are so much clearer than those of adults.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: Nobody came right out and told us that, we just know (the NAZI songs which they sang while marching stated their intentions in so many words that Jews were in danger).</span> <span id="s243">They called us Jews and other things (the yellow stars of David which all Jews had to wear by NAZI law).</span> <span id="s244">By that time I was already gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: You went to England then without your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: Yes, I went all by myself.</span> <span id="s247">I believe that my father went with me when I left to get me started.</span> <span id="s248">He actually couldn’t speak English either.</span> <span id="s249">We went to a boarding school in the South of England, near Brighton (50.50N,0.10W), near Bournemouth (50.43N,1.54W).</span> <span id="s250">We had made arrangements that some funds, which he had somehow transferred, would pay since the boarding school was not cheap.</span> <span id="s251">I only returned to Germany for one vacation.</span> <span id="s252">After that I did not dare go back because they might not let me back out.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: What was the name of the school you went to?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: It was called Oldfield School in a little town near Bournemouth.</span> <span id="s255">The little town was Swanage (50.37N,1.58W) in Dorset.</span> <span id="s256">That was a primary school, sort of like a grade school.</span> <span id="s257">I graduated from there, then I went to another school called Hirstubine College which is one of the famous English Public Schools.</span> <span id="s258">These schools, in England were anything but public.</span> <span id="s259">You pay tuition.</span> <span id="s260">They are a good way to get into Oxford or Cambridge.</span> <span id="s261">These are the ultimate in England.</span> <span id="s262">They are the two top universities.</span> <span id="s263">You take examinations there.</span> <span id="s264">I took the School certificate and then the Higher certificate.</span> <span id="s265">That qualified me for entrance into Cambridge or Oxford without anything further.</span> <span id="s266">This was then accepted here, in the United States, where I went to Ohio University, University of Dayton, and Ohio State University.</span> <span id="s267">They accepted my credits, together with some test as being equivalent to something beyond United States High School graduation.</span> <span id="s268">I was able to get into some mathematics classes at the Sophomore or Junior level.</span> <span id="s269">So the education of an English Public School is similar to high school in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: So, how long were you in England?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: I was there from 1936 to April 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: Did your brother come along?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: My brother came then two weeks later.</span> <span id="s274">They tried to do the same thing then (it is suspected that Interviewee means years rather than weeks) but they couldn’t get the money.</span> <span id="s275">I was able to, through the Jewish Community in Bournemouth.</span> <span id="s276">They were able to get a scholarship at the same school where I went.</span> <span id="s277">He went there while I went to the Public School.</span> <span id="s278">He was there for about 2 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: You lived at the school?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s281">These were both boarding schools.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: You must have had a language problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: Oh, yes!</span> <span id="s284">You can say that.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: How quickly did you learn English?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: You learn it pretty quickly when you have to.</span> <span id="s287">I think that it took about 6 months.</span> <span id="s288">At first I knew “Yes” and “No,” that was about it.</span> <span id="s289">Some of them know some French and some know a little Latin.</span> <span id="s290">I know Latin quite well; I had had 3 or 4 years of it, and I had had 5 years of French.</span> <span id="s291">That is how we got by.</span> <span id="s292">I listened, and I remembered.</span> <span id="s293">This boarding school had little children from 6 years on up.</span> <span id="s294">I was 13 then, so I was one of the older ones.</span> <span id="s295">I remember that these little children could speak English so well.</span> <span id="s296">I couldn’t believe how they could do it, and I had so much trouble.</span> <span id="s297">I had to think so hard to learn how to speak English.</span> <span id="s298">But you soon learn, when you are forced to.</span> <span id="s299">I was never able to completely eliminate the accent.</span> <span id="s300">My brother, however, has no accent in English.</span> <span id="s301">He lost his.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: Was there a large Jewish Community in the area of Bournemouth?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: In Bournemouth there was but I never met any Jewish people in Swanage.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: There were no Jews in the school.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: Oh no.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: Did you experience some anti-Semitism at the school?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: No.</span> <span id="s308">None at all.</span> <span id="s309">They were very friendly.</span> <span id="s310">They knew that I was different since I couldn’t speak English - and so I was.</span> <span id="s311">However, I tried to participate and I tried to learn.</span> <span id="s312">I could keep up with them in athletics, pretty well; so, other than for the language problem I could keep up.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: What did your parents do while you were in England?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: I wasn’t there so I really don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: Did you write pretty much?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: My father had that big business.</span> <span id="s317">In 1938 they forced them to sell it.</span> <span id="s318">The forced sale was all legal.</span> <span id="s319">You know in Germany everything had to be done by the book.</span> <span id="s320">It was all legally taken away from you.</span> <span id="s321">They sold it and then all the money was confiscated.</span> <span id="s322">I know that there were large sums involved.</span> <span id="s323">They did that and then they packed their things.</span> <span id="s324">My mother was probably very busy just arranging everything.</span> <span id="s325">They packed what they called a “lift van” (a prefabricated container which was then transshipped by boat) with all the physical belongings and they sent it to the Untied States.</span> <span id="s326">It just got here when the war broke out.</span> <span id="s327">It was about 1 week too late, so they did not unload it.</span> <span id="s328">They took it back to Europe and unloaded it in Holland.</span> <span id="s329">Then it got lost.</span> <span id="s330">The next thing was to get my brother out.</span> <span id="s331">They got him out in 1938.</span> <span id="s332">Then they mainly spent their time getting out of Germany.</span> <span id="s333">The way they got out was interesting since they couldn’t get to the United States because of the quota system.</span> <span id="s334">I was at Hirstubine College then (transcriber is not certain about the exact name).</span> <span id="s335">They told me that if you could get an affidavit to come to England they could get out of Germany.</span> <span id="s336">However, they wouldn’t let you in unless you had someone guarantee that you would not become a burden to the state, just like they required in the United States.</span> <span id="s337">I became friendly with several of my English classmates.</span> <span id="s338">One was fairly wealthy.</span> <span id="s339">I believe that this father was in real estate.</span> <span id="s340">He lived in a town north of London.</span> <span id="s341">When I couldn’t go anywhere (when school was in recess) they invited me to stay with them on holy days.</span> <span id="s342">England does not have a long summer recess as we do.</span> <span id="s343">They have one month, in either July or August.</span> <span id="s344">I told them my predicament that my parents couldn’t get out.</span> <span id="s345">It turned out, I don’t know the details that this man gave the affidavit that he would make sure that my parents would not become a burden to the state, such as welfare, or anything like that.</span> <span id="s346">For the British my parents had to agree not to work.</span> <span id="s347">You were not allowed either to work or to get welfare.</span> <span id="s348">That is not what we do with the refugees who come here now; however, in England it is still pretty much that way.</span> <span id="s349">You cannot come to England and become a burden.</span> <span id="s350">This man guaranteed that, and my parents scraped together whatever little money they had and lived in London.</span> <span id="s351">They came out 2 days before the war started.</span> <span id="s352">The war started September 3, 1939.</span> <span id="s353">They came out September 2, 1939; they came to Amsterdam, then to England based on this man’s affidavit.</span> <span id="s354">They stayed in London, asking the United States Government to please get on the quota.</span> <span id="s355">When the war broke out in September 1939, everything changed since all the Jews were caught in Germany and could no longer come to the United States, then the German quota got a lot more open.</span> <span id="s356">We were still considered Germans, although we were in England, because we had been born in Germany, as far as the quota went.</span> <span id="s357">So our number (a family received one quota number if traveling together) came up in April 1940, much sooner than would have otherwise have been the case.</span> <span id="s358">As soon as it came up we got tickets to come to New York.</span> <span id="s359">So I left school and came with the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: You said that you went home to Germany on one vacation.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: Was that in 1938?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: I imagine.</span> <span id="s364">I started in England in 1936.</span> <span id="s365">I remember that the routing was to take a train from London then a ferry across to Belgium and the Bremerhaven (53.33N,8.35E) in Germany.</span> <span id="s366">I remember arriving in Augsburg and seeing my parents and being very happy and a few weeks later I took the train back.</span> <span id="s367">I was pretty worried when the Germans had my passport, since they controlled everything.</span> <span id="s368">I said: “I hope they don’t make difficulties, that I pass their border controls.”</span> <span id="s369">Then I got back on the ferry to England and back to school.</span> <span id="s370">After that my parents told me not to come back because they might not let me back out.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: When your parents came to London where did they live?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: In a very small apartment.</span> <span id="s373">They didn’t have any money.</span> <span id="s374">They had to leave all their money in Germany.</span> <span id="s375">They had a one room efficiency in some inexpensive London tenement I imagine.</span> <span id="s376">I was there for only 2 days because I stayed at the school I went to.</span> <span id="s377">That was until 2 days before the ship left; then I came to London with whatever few possessions I had.</span> <span id="s378">Then we went to Liverpool and we took the ship to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: How long did they live in London?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: They came over in September 1939 and we left in April 1940.</span> <span id="s381">About 7 months.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: I am just curious how they paid for the apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s384">They were able to take a little bit with them, somehow, very little.</span> <span id="s385">They left everything behind them.</span> <span id="s386">I don’t know how they did things.</span> <span id="s387">When we came to New York, we had just had enough means to pay for the passage on the Cunard White Star line.</span> <span id="s388">We had no money for anything when we got to New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: Do you recall your first impressions of New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: The Statue of Liberty was very impressive.</span> <span id="s391">I said: “Gee, at last we are free!”</span> <span id="s392">(The English passenger ship had operated under blackout conditions in order to outrun the German submarines).</span> <span id="s393">.</span> <span id="s394">You do of course get a little overwhelmed by the city.</span> <span id="s395">I had an aunt and uncle who lived in New York and we were still hoping to see them.</span> <span id="s396">They had not wanted to get involved (give us affidavits) because they did not want to have to support us either, although he was quite wealthy.</span> <span id="s397">However, they were nice to us, at least they met us.</span> <span id="s398">They rented a small apartment for us.</span> <span id="s399">After that, it was up to us.</span> <span id="s400">We had been hoping that at least someone would meet us at the boat so that we would know where to go.</span> <span id="s401">It is so overpowering when you come in.</span> <span id="s402">However, by then I could speak English, that was a big advantage.</span> <span id="s403">In England it was worse since we couldn’t speak any English and they didn’t speak any German in England.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: So your parents came basically without jobs, or money?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: Oh yes, without anything!</span> <span id="s406">Yes, just the clothes on our back.</span> <span id="s407">All our furniture and our valuables were in the lift-van which was returned to Holland.</span> <span id="s408">You know, it is something like today’s container boxes.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: Are they crates?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: It is like today when we buy toys (The Farnbacher Co. in Dayton sold toys wholesale) in containers from Japan or Hong Kong, or whatever.</span> <span id="s411">They can fill the entire thing full of stuff.</span> <span id="s412">The container is then loaded on a ship by a crane then unloaded and put on a truck and you can ship it anywheres.</span> <span id="s413">All the furnishings and other earthly belongings were in that thing, and then it was not unloaded.</span> <span id="s414">The ship came to new York, they unloaded the humans - the passengers - that was when the war broke out so they said that they didn’t have enough time.</span> <span id="s415">The German government ordered the ship back to Germany.</span> <span id="s416">They asked: “What about the stuff in the cargo hold?”</span> <span id="s417">They said: “Forget it, just get back here!”</span> <span id="s418">As is ended up all these lift-vans, I am certain that there were also others, they ended up in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s419">Either they were broken into and effects stolen or otherwise destroyed during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: You were about 16 when you came here?</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: I was actually 17 when I came to the United States, or nearly so.</span> <span id="s422">I had my 17th birthday in September of the year where we arrived in April.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: How long did you live in New York City?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: Not very long.</span> <span id="s425">I received a scholarship to go to Ohio University in Athens.</span> <span id="s426">The school (OU) started right after Labor Day.</span> <span id="s427">I worked in a factory, you know we needed money.</span> <span id="s428">My uncle had an egg farm in New Jersey and he would send us 30 dozen eggs in a crate; we took them out and candled them (that is the act of holding the eggs between a source of light and the eyes to detect staleness, blood clots, etc.) then we packed them up in 1 dozen egg crates and we went from one apartment to the other, trying to sell eggs.</span> <span id="s429">That was the first thing we did, and how we made a little money.</span> <span id="s430">It was hard work and the financial return was very little.</span> <span id="s431">Then I got a job for about $12.00 a week (30 cents an hour at the time was federally established minimum wages) in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s432">We lived up on 207th Street in Manhattan, that is a long ways from Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s433">I took the subway at 5:30 or 6:00 am.</span> <span id="s434">I did that for 44 hours a week and made about $12.00.</span> <span id="s435">In 1940 that ws better than nothing.</span> <span id="s436">In 1940 I was the main wage earner.</span> <span id="s437">I did that from April until I got the scholarship when the school started in September.</span> <span id="s438">I went to Athens, Ohio and I started my engineering studies.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: Did your father work in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: He had a very hard time.</span> <span id="s441">He was at least 55, or he could have been 60.</span> <span id="s442">He was selling these eggs but it was very hard to make a living that way.</span> <span id="s443">So that winter, when I went to OU, they went down to Florida to manage an apartment for one of the people who had given them the affidavits.</span> <span id="s444">This man, a friend of theirs, lived in New Haven, CT.</span> <span id="s445">He owned apartment houses in Hollywood, FL.</span> <span id="s446">They ran these apartment houses like a janitor and a maintenance man.</span> <span id="s447">My father had 2 left thumbs, you know that he had been a businessman.</span> <span id="s448">My mother had never cleaned anything.</span> <span id="s449">She had always had 2 or 3 maids and she now was the cleaning woman to clean up and rent the apartments.</span> <span id="s450">They did that that winter and then that was 1940 - 1941, they ended up here in Dayton, because I was at OU.</span> <span id="s451">There was another couple who lived in Dayton and who were from Augsburg.</span> <span id="s452">They heard that it was Ohio, so they thought that it is in Ohio, that is where John is going to school.</span> <span id="s453">They figured that it would be right next door.</span> <span id="s454">Of course Athens is about 200 miles from Dayton.</span> <span id="s455">I guess that they ever looked at a map.</span> <span id="s456">They figured that it would be easy to visit their son.</span> <span id="s457">So they came to Dayton and the Jewish Community helped them.</span> <span id="s458">They helped them very little, but they helped them a little to find a place.</span> <span id="s459">They gave them some real terrible old, used furniture, but at least they had something.</span> <span id="s460">The rented a small, terrible place, just over a grocery store for them.</span> <span id="s461">It was on Broadway and Riverview.</span> <span id="s462">It was real minimal.</span> <span id="s463">Today it is a service station.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: Did they have any trouble learning English?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: No, they had studied English in Germany.</span> <span id="s466">They knew where they were going.</span> <span id="s467">They also lived in England for several months.</span> <span id="s468">I had had no notice as to where I was going.</span> <span id="s469">I had not known exactly when I was going to go to England, once the decision was made that I was to go.</span> <span id="s470">I just quit school and took a crash course in English.</span> <span id="s471">I had had only about 2 or 3 weeks.</span> <span id="s472">After I went to England my parents and my brother took English lessons.</span> <span id="s473">So we could understand some and when you spoke slowly they could keep up with you.</span> <span id="s474">Then I believe that my father got a job at Rike’s.</span> <span id="s475">My mother finally went to work also.</span> <span id="s476">It is amazing what you have to do when you have no money.</span> <span id="s477">I believe that my father worked in the warehouse, as a stockman, maybe he was doing such things as pricing merchandise.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: What did your mother do?</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: She first started in the stockroom and then since she can sell very well, she ended up in the Moraine room selling coats, and better dresses.</span> <span id="s480">There she made a little more money.</span> <span id="s481">Then when the war came along, 1941 - 1942, and things got tough in the department stores they heard that the people at Wright Field were looking for people who could speak German.</span> <span id="s482">They had captured some German things (documents) already then.</span> <span id="s483">Later on it became a flood.</span> <span id="s484">They captured all these German documents, and they wanted people to translate them.</span> <span id="s485">During the period of 1943 - 1944, they then worked for the Air Force at Wright Field and made reasonably good money.</span> <span id="s486">Then I was drafted into the Air Force in 1944 I believe.</span> <span id="s487">Then I was stationed out there also because they mentioned that I was in the Air Force and that I could speak German.</span> <span id="s488">They were desperate for people who could speak German.</span> <span id="s489">They captured so many documents that no one could go through it all.</span> <span id="s490">They had crates after crates of things.</span> <span id="s491">So I was employed over there also in the Intelligence Division, in G2.</span> <span id="s492">With my engineering background I could - I have 2 engineering degrees - not only translate the documents but also figure out what they were talking about.</span> <span id="s493">So I helped classify and translate documents for the Air Force.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: Did you get drafted after you graduated from College?</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: Yes, in 1944 or 1945, I guess.</span> <span id="s496">I was first drafted (called in for the draft but not sworn in) in 1941 but I am nearsighted and in the beginning of the war if you were not a perfect 100 percent specimen you got classified 4F or 2A.</span> <span id="s497">So I was turned down because of my glasses.</span> <span id="s498">Later on in the war, when you were breathing you were plenty good for the army, then I was drafted into the Air Corps.</span> <span id="s499">I was all set to go overseas, to Japan, I believe, but then the Air Corps, somehow heard about me.</span> <span id="s500">I was lucky that I was in the Air Corps, not the Army.</span> <span id="s501">The Air Corps had all their documents and were looking for people who could speak German.</span> <span id="s502">Somehow my parents did tell someone about my language, just in time, because the entire group that I went to basic training and then mechanics training and other training with, the whole troop was going overseas.</span> <span id="s503">I got my orders one day before they got theirs.</span> <span id="s504">Their orders were to go to Okinawa, I believe.</span> <span id="s505">I was sent up to Wright Patterson.</span> <span id="s506">That was very nice.</span> <span id="s507">I lived at home and translated, all for $50.00 a month, or whatever they paid me.</span> <span id="s508">Maybe it was $75.00 monthly.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: Did you have a Masters degree at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: No, I had my Bachelors degree.</span> <span id="s511">Later, after I got discharged of course, I was entitled to the GI Bill.</span> <span id="s512">I thought: “Why not use it?”</span> <span id="s513">So I went to get my Masters degree at Ohio State University.</span> <span id="s514">Then I went to work after I graduated.</span> <span id="s515">That is where I met this young lady.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: I should have asked earlier: “Did your parents ever keep Kashrut at home?”</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: No!</span> <span id="s518">My grandfather did.</span> <span id="s519">You know my mother’s father.</span> <span id="s520">They were considerable more religious.</span> <span id="s521">The entire community in Augsburg was very easy going, in so far as religion goes.</span> <span id="s522">They went to Synagogue regularly, but that was it.</span> <span id="s523">That is all they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: I was also wondering whether their religious practices changed after they came to this country.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: Were you religious when you were away from home, at school?</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: Not really because I had no occasion.</span> <span id="s528">There was no Synagogue in England.</span> <span id="s529">There was one in London of course.</span> <span id="s530">Then I felt, and this goes into my deep inner feelings, that what happened to me is something which I certainly don’t want to happen to any children of mine.</span> <span id="s531">So I married a Catholic wife and my children are Catholic.</span> <span id="s532">I have never joined their faith because that would make me feel a little hypocritical doing that but I feel that, if I hadn’t been Jewish, I still would be in Germany.</span> <span id="s533">Well, maybe then I would be worse off.</span> <span id="s534">I felt that I don’t want my children to have to go through what I have had to go through.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: Did you lose a lot of family?</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: Yes, everybody.</span> <span id="s537">I just had my parents.</span> <span id="s538">They lived in this country.</span> <span id="s539">They passed away of natural causes.</span> <span id="s540">I also have my brother who came with us.</span> <span id="s541">The only other members of my family I mentioned my father’s brother, who wanted to stay there.</span> <span id="s542">He and his wife and all his children, except his one daughter, perished.</span> <span id="s543">The daughter lives in Chicago.</span> <span id="s544">We got her to come here.</span> <span id="s545">She is a little older than I am.</span> <span id="s546">She had lived in England and had a very hard life, so we talked her into coming to the United States.</span> <span id="s547">Actually, she met a very nice lawyer and she is very happy in Chicago.</span> <span id="s548">The only other member of my family who survived are: my mother had a sister, this aunt and my uncle, they came to the United States, about the time we did.</span> <span id="s549">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s550">They live in Providence but they are quite elderly.</span> <span id="s551">He is 92 and she is 81 or 82.</span> <span id="s552">They have one son who is about 58.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: Everybody else got killed?</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: Yes, everybody else got killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: Did you ever try to find out what happened to them, after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: Well, we know what happened to them.</span> <span id="s557">The last we heard is that they were taken to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s558">My mother tried desperately to get them out, after we were here.</span> <span id="s559">They had even picked a spot to go through Russia.</span> <span id="s560">They were going to go that way because you could no longer go through Europe.</span> <span id="s561">Nothing worked.</span> <span id="s562">They just couldn’t get them out.</span> <span id="s563">Actually we didn’t have a very big family.</span> <span id="s564">My father’s parents had died earlier, they were older.</span> <span id="s565">But my mother’s parents and all my uncles got killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: So your degrees are in engineering?</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: Yes, I have 2 engineering degrees, but I worked in engineering for only 10 years.</span> <span id="s568">I got my 2nd degree in 1947, and in 1957 I got out.</span> <span id="s569">After the war my father didn’t want to go back (probably meaning Europe).</span> <span id="s570">He said “I don’t know anything else so I will start a business in retailing.”</span> <span id="s571">We said: “You can’t start a business in the United States!”</span> <span id="s572">He said: “Why?</span> <span id="s573">I am going to do it anyway!</span> <span id="s574">I can’t do anything else.”</span> <span id="s575">So he took some little toy samples, because he ha been in the toy business, and he took a street car, which they then had in Dayton - the street car out to Soldier’s Home with his little samples and walked all the way back.</span> <span id="s576">He was trying to sell these little toys.</span> <span id="s577">Then he had toys shipped to his house on Lexington Avenue and he took them on the street car to sell them.</span> <span id="s578">Then Rike’s helped us.</span> <span id="s579">He met the toy buyer at Rike’s and he bought from my father.</span> <span id="s580">That is how our business got started.</span> <span id="s581">We had a pretty large business, toy business.</span> <span id="s582">He started this in 1947, right after the war, then my brother got into it in about 1951.</span> <span id="s583">My mother was in it.</span> <span id="s584">It kept getting bigger.</span> <span id="s585">Then in 1957 - I had a pretty good job at GHR Foundry, which just recently closed, however.</span> <span id="s586">I was up high in the management - they told me “Well, why don’t you join us?”</span> <span id="s587">We debated for a long time whether to do that.</span> <span id="s588">We finally decided that I should.</span> <span id="s589">My brother and I, after my father died, we made this business pretty large.</span> <span id="s590">We had about 30 employees.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: What is the name of the business?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: It is no longer in existence.</span> <span id="s593">Farnbacher co.</span> <span id="s594">In 1978 we had a very big fire.</span> <span id="s595">It all burned down.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: I remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: You were here then?</span> <span id="s598">We then had the toy business in Dayton.</span> <span id="s599">So we lost 2 businesses in our lifetime.</span> <span id="s600">However, this time was not quite so bad.</span> <span id="s601">We had substantial insurance.</span> <span id="s602">At first it was a tragedy and my wife thought that I would have a heart attack, while it was happening, however, when things began to settle we were able to collect 90 percent, no 99 percent of our accounts.</span> <span id="s603">We could pay our bills and after it was all settled we had more money than we thought we had.</span> <span id="s604">So now I work for what was then our competition, the Fink Co., which is a local wholesaler.</span> <span id="s605">I take care of all their toys.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: You said that you had your children raised Catholic?</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: Because you were afraid of something like this happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: I wouldn’t want anything like that.</span> <span id="s610">Of course Sally is Catholic, so it would be natural to her.</span> <span id="s611">However, I was looking for a Christian wife because I felt “well this can happen again.”</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: Did you suffer a lot while you were growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: I think that in the United States the Jews have a better chance.</span> <span id="s614">However, I do sometimes feel, you know, what New York Jews seem like, especially when you go abroad or when you go to Florida.</span> <span id="s615">They have loud voices, and they want everything and they are very rich.</span> <span id="s616">They attract attention.</span> <span id="s617">This is what we used to do in Germany.</span> <span id="s618">I always think, well, of course, we didn’t do that, but others, friends of ours did.</span> <span id="s619">My parents were always introverted.</span> <span id="s620">However, we went to the finest places and we had the best dinners.</span> <span id="s621">Incidentally we didn’t have cars.</span> <span id="s622">My parents had, I believe, 6 or 8 cars which belonged to the business, but my father never learned to drive, so we always had a chauffeur.</span> <span id="s623">Of course we never did these things, but I felt that that is part of what happened to the Jews in Germany.</span> <span id="s624">Being very wealthy, they were in control and they showed it to everybody.</span> <span id="s625">I often think that when you go to Miami or some other places where the wealthy Jews are, they are asking for trouble.</span> <span id="s626">You know, if you are inconspicuous and just do your business nobody cares how much money you have.</span> <span id="s627">It doesn’t matter.</span> <span id="s628">But if you tell everybody how rich you are it makes people envious.</span> <span id="s629">We felt that the Jews in Germany did that.</span> <span id="s630">We hope that they don’t do that here.</span></p></body></html>
