<p><span id="s12">Q: Would you tell me your name please?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A: My name is Barbara Rodbell, currently.</span> <span id="s14">My maiden was Lederman.</span> <span id="s15">Q: And where and when were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: I was born in Berlin, Germany, September 4, 1925.</span> <span id="s17">My mother's name was Else Citroen Citon, which means lemon, and it is a Dutch name because her father was from Holland had come from -- to Germany from Holland, and married my grandmother, Ellen Citreon Sileppe.</span> <span id="s18">Her name was Sileppe in Berlin.</span> <span id="s19">And so that is how the Dutch family lived in Berlin because that's where they married.</span> <span id="s20">They were three children, the old— four children actually, the oldest died very -- at 18.</span> <span id="s21">She was a poet and a wonderfully, well loved child, and she had a brain tumor and died.</span> <span id="s22">It took a while year and my youngest uncle tells that he has never seen his mother in anything but black ever after.</span> <span id="s23">So I saw her in other clothes, but he never saw her in anything but black as he grew up.</span> <span id="s24">At least that's how he sees it.</span> <span id="s25">People sees things in different ways.</span> <span id="s26">My mother, I remember as a childhood, as being relatively happy and her oldest brother was Paul, and he was lively and he was a painter.</span> <span id="s27">Didn't pay attention to anything but painting and art.</span> <span id="s28">And then she -- then it was she, and then it was a brother, Hans who also survived the war.</span> <span id="s29">The -- they all -- the brothers survived the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Each of them had their own story, but they all survived the war.</span> <span id="s31">We lived in Berlin, and I had a sister, named Susannah who was three years younger than I was.</span> <span id="s32">And we -- my father was a lawyer, born in Hisberg, Silesian, over Silesian, and in Germany and studied in Verslomberland, later in Geneva for his Ph.D. in law.</span> <span id="s33">And he had a good practice.</span> <span id="s34">And he was quite old really.</span> <span id="s35">He was 35 when he married my mother.</span> <span id="s36">My mother was 20.</span> <span id="s37">That was done that way, that way, in those days.</span> <span id="s38">Anyway, I was born a year later and I remember my childhood in Berlin as being wonderful.</span> <span id="s39">It was -- my father loved Berlin, and we went all over Berlin as soon as I could walk.</span> <span id="s40">And he showed me absolutely everything.</span> <span id="s41">Every little corner, and he liked history and music and we went to museums and I still remember where the Rembrandt hung in this museum in Ber-- in Berlin because he loved it so.</span> <span id="s42">And I remember the trains from Casovillan trains, and the stories he told me about how Casovillan used to have big dinners in those trains, and he was a very faster easter, Casovillan was.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Nobody ever got anything to eat because he was always finished before the last person was served and everybody had to leave very hungry.</span> <span id="s44">This was one of my father's story, stories.</span> <span id="s45">And my sister was born three years later, and we were very happy.</span> <span id="s46">We always went to Holland on vacation.</span> <span id="s47">And in 1933, when we went to Holland on vacation, one of my many cousins of my father's, Uncle Biet Pierson who was a journalist, a editor of a paper in The Hague said to my mother he felt that she should not go back.</span> <span id="s48">This was 1933.</span> <span id="s49">And Uncle Biet had, when he was very young -- when he was 19 and, and just learning to be a journalist, he had been sent to Munich to cover a trial.</span> <span id="s50">And nobody in Holland paid in attention to this trial.</span> <span id="s51">And when he came back and he wrote up his paper, they said to him, "Why are you making such a fuss?"</span> <span id="s52">And he said, "You pay attention to this trial.</span> <span id="s53">This is going to end up being something quite awful and better everybody pay attention.”</span> <span id="s54">It was Hitler's trial in 1923.</span> <span id="s55">And he was, you know, he was the only of them paid any attention to it.</span> <span id="s56">Took 10 years til things really heated up.</span> <span id="s57">So my mother, who always listened to my father because my father was the older one and, you know, he was the leader in our family said to my father, "I think we shouldn't go back.”</span> <span id="s58">And my father said, "What does a lawyer do in a foreign country?"</span> <span id="s59">That's not a very good idea, and what am I going to do?"</span> <span id="s60">And she said, "Well, I don't know.</span> <span id="s61">You'll find something to do.</span> <span id="s62">It's -- I really think we should not go back.”</span> <span id="s63">And so father said, "Well, I'm going to go back and see what I can do.”</span> <span id="s64">I mean he had -- I think he graduated he'd already been a lawyer for 25 years.</span> <span id="s65">I mean it was -- it was practically impossible for him to start over.</span> <span id="s66">He spoke a few words of Dutch, but not very much.</span> <span id="s67">He got to Berlin and he went into his office and there were his secretaries and his assistants and stuff.</span> <span id="s68">There was also a big letter from the government, which said that from now on, he could only have Jewish clients.</span> <span id="s69">My father had no -- had very few, I should say, Jewish clients.</span> <span id="s70">I didn't know any Jewish clients that he had.</span> <span id="s71">But he had things like the Mid- European Watch Industry, a , Swiss Watch industry.</span> <span id="s72">He had big companies that were his clients, and now he could not represent them anymore.</span> <span id="s73">He packed up.</span> <span id="s74">And we could still -- I mean he could ship as much as he wanted to Holland.</span> <span id="s75">And we had two grand pianos, and he sold them because he didn't think that we could -- would have the money to have enough house or an apartment big enough to hold grand pianos so there was a big change in our standard of living.</span> <span id="s76">I mean I was raised with nurses and governesses and with English and French and you have Dutch and all those various things, with horse back riding and good schools.</span> <span id="s77">And when we got to Holland, of course, we had a little apartment.</span> <span id="s78">My father had to go back to school, to the -- to the university.</span> <span id="s79">He worked for a Dutch .</span> <span id="s80">He worked for a Dutch lawyer, but he had to learn Dutch, of course.</span> <span id="s81">He handled the clients who were very much like him who had come to Holland and, you know, he couldn't practice along because he didn't have the Dutch degree.</span> <span id="s82">So he went to the university, and I think he was now -- how old was he in ‘34, ’35?</span> <span id="s83">He graduated in three years in a foreign language.</span> <span id="s84">I was -- we were very proud of him.</span> <span id="s85">It was very hard.</span> <span id="s86">He also worked at the same time.</span> <span id="s87">There was a big party and everybody came and then a few years later the Germans walked in, and it was all over.</span> <span id="s88">We are now getting to the point where my -- Let me go back and say that when we got to Holland and I got to my first school, in my class was a girl named Margo Frank.</span> <span id="s89">And they lived right behind us on the .</span> <span id="s90">We lived at the which was the back of the same kind of development that they lived in.</span> <span id="s91">And we -- we always played at .</span> <span id="s92">That's how we met.</span> <span id="s93">And then our parents, of course, met, having coming from Germany the same year and having a lot of common and the Frank's and my parents socialized a lot and, of course, the kids played.</span> <span id="s94">As a matter of fact, Margo dragged me through school.</span> <span id="s95">Without her, I would have never made anything done anything because I was full of play and I was -- wanted to become a dancer and I worked very, very hard at that, but not at much else.</span> <span id="s96">So without her saying, "Today, we study," I wouldn't have been able to get through.</span> <span id="s97">So here we are in school and working hard and my sister's doing very, very well.</span> <span id="s98">She was very smart.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">And my father had great hopes she'd become a lawyer like he was.</span> <span id="s100">He would've like me to become a lawyer, but I think he gave up on me long -- very early because that was not my thing.</span> <span id="s101">I was more the way my mother's family was.</span> <span id="s102">More playful and -- and liked imaginary games and things like that.</span> <span id="s103">Let's see, where shall we go now?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: Let's -- let's talk a little more about your friends and your childhood.</span> <span id="s105">Did you meet Ann Frank too?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: Well, of course, we all played together, you know.</span> <span id="s107">And Ann came to the house a lot and we went to her house a lot.</span> <span id="s108">When my kids grew up, I -- I could see that, you know, the same kind of thing, you know.</span> <span id="s109">You -- you go around to the people in your neighborhood and you work together for the schools and you do various things and My sister was a lot more serious than Ann was.</span> <span id="s110">Anne liked games the way I did.</span> <span id="s111">And she liked to play and have imagina -- imaginary games, and she was very high strung -- very easily upset, and -- .</span> <span id="s112">My sister tried to get along with all that, but it wasn't always easy.</span> <span id="s113">Ann was a very difficult child, an extremely difficult child.</span> <span id="s114">And not just for her family, but in school and she went to a special school, a Montessori kind of school I think or Dalton in one of those two kinds of school.</span> <span id="s115">And she did very well there.</span> <span id="s116">Not as well as Margaret, who was an absolute genius, if you ask me.</span> <span id="s117">But who -- Margaret also was very calm, and at least what I always saw of her was very calm, very deliberate, very, very beautiful.</span> <span id="s118">Margaret was very beautiful.</span> <span id="s119">Had great big brown eyes -- a very serious person.</span> <span id="s120">She would have made a real mark in the world.</span> <span id="s121">I know that.</span> <span id="s122">Just like my sister.</span> <span id="s123">My sister -- .</span> <span id="s124">I can't even imagine how wonderful she would have been.</span> <span id="s125">She was so smart and so sweet and -- and she was very anxious to be very close to me which was amazing, you know, for a young girl.</span> <span id="s126">She wanted to see what I was doing and later on, as I got older, she was very interested in my friends and she always had very -- a lot of good advice for me.</span> <span id="s127">This is no good, and this is very good, and you know, she was just -- and she was so sensible.</span> <span id="s128">It was amazing!</span> <span id="s129">One of the letters I gave you is from her, and there you will see all that.</span> <span id="s130">It's a very good letter.</span> <span id="s131">Very, very young girl!</span> <span id="s132">Anyway, we had a normal, very happy kind of childhood with a lot of music and my Uncle Paul was a painter and a Dutchman, a Dutch painter, with a enormous German accent, but his nationality was Dutch.</span> <span id="s133">He was born in Berlin, but at 18 he had to choose whether he wanted to be German or Dutch because he was born in Germany but -- but he had a Dutch passport because of his father.</span> <span id="s134">And something in him made him make the right choice and he chose Holland and he went to Holland and -- and lived there even since, and became quite a well known painter and had a very happy life in -- in Holland.</span> <span id="s135">Married a beautiful woman, had a daughter, and I have two very close relatives about my same age.</span> <span id="s136">One is his daughter, Paulinka, and one is the daughter of my Uncle Hans, the younger brother of my mother who is Tamara and she is in Israel.</span> <span id="s137">She lives in Israel with her family.</span> <span id="s138">And now why was I telling you all this?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: Family and friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: Family and friends.</span> <span id="s141">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: Can we go back a little bit?</span> <span id="s143">I would like to go back just cause it has some relevance to your childhood.</span> <span id="s144">There was a group of friends with you and Ann Frank and Margo.</span> <span id="s145">You had talked Hanna.</span> <span id="s146">You had talked about Tummi.</span> <span id="s147">And there's a picture all of you playing at the party.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s149">Well</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: Tell us about that circle and tell us about that party.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: Well, these were -- these were mostly -- mostly, because on some of those pictures are also a lot of Dutch kids who were playing also who only were living in the same neighborhood.</span> <span id="s152">By the neighborhood was entirely mixed.</span> <span id="s153">Wasn't all Jewish.</span> <span id="s154">Was a completely mixed neighborhood.</span> <span id="s155">And as far as I knew the Dutch Jews and the Germans Jews got along very well.</span> <span id="s156">And I have just read a book which said that they were really pretty separate when it came to it.</span> <span id="s157">.</span> <span id="s158">you know when things got tight.</span> <span id="s159">But I personally have never -- have never experienced that.</span> <span id="s160">And when I got to think about it not until I got in with a group of young people who were stridently trying to survive was it really all German?</span> <span id="s161">-- at that point I realize it was all German.</span> <span id="s162">It wasn't really my family that created that kind of atmosphere, but it was more when we were on our own, without family, you know, that it suddenly appeared that I really was in a German Jewish circle.</span> <span id="s163">This was when we were trying to save ourselves, you understand?</span> <span id="s164">As -- as children we played altogether -- everybody played together and was very good relationships between everybody.</span> <span id="s165">I've never heard my parents or Otto Frank, who by the way was an absolute angel, ever, you know, say anything nasty or have -- had any kind of problem with Dutch with the Dutch people.</span> <span id="s166">And, of course, I was half Dutch anyway.</span> <span id="s167">And the first time I realized I really wasn't Dutch was when the Germans came to Holland and there was five days where -- before -- before the Queen left Holland, while the Germans were there -- while the Dutch were fighting the Germans we were not allowed -- we had a great curfew.</span> <span id="s168">We were not allowed in the streets.</span> <span id="s169">And my grandparents and my neighbors had to bring -- my grandmother and my neighbor had to bring us food and everything because they wouldn't allow Germans -- we were then taken as Germans, not -- not as German Jews, but as Germans, and we weren't allowed to go out and to buy food except very limited periods of time during the day.</span> <span id="s170">It was the first time that I realized that "Hey.</span> <span id="s171">Hey.</span> <span id="s172">I'm really German.</span> <span id="s173">I'm not really Dutch.”</span> <span id="s174">I never, you know, it -- I wasn't even aware of it, except when I came from Berlin and I went to school.</span> <span id="s175">I was in the -- I was in the 3rd Grade.</span> <span id="s176">I was put into the 3rd Grade.</span> <span id="s177">I was eight years old.</span> <span id="s178">And I had to write what they called in which write, you know, somebody reads something to you and you write it down.</span> <span id="s179">I had 40 mistakes I think in -- in 30 words, or something like that because I couldn't.</span> <span id="s180">I think even Margo had 25 mistakes, but still it was a lot less than I had.</span> <span id="s181">That was -- you know, there I realized, you know, that it.</span> <span id="s182">.</span> <span id="s183">that it was hard.</span> <span id="s184">And my clothes were all wrong.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Because Berlin was very -- we were very elegant in Berlin, you know.</span> <span id="s186">I had fur coats and a hat -- you know, ridiculous really if you think about it now, it's -- but that's how it was in those days.</span> <span id="s187">In Holland, the kids were pretty much more still more , more plain, even in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s188">And the clothes I had were absolutely inappropriate.</span> <span id="s189">So at some point there, I said to my mother, "This is it.</span> <span id="s190">That coat goes."</span> <span id="s191">I had a Russian -- I had Russian coat which was embroidered with a Russian hat, you know, with the embroidery around and stuff and I said, "Never am I going to wear this thing again.”</span> <span id="s192">"You give it away to somebody in Germany.”</span> <span id="s193">I mean I -- I -- it was too embarrassing.</span> <span id="s194">Nobody wore clothes that.</span> <span id="s195">So I had to get used to, you know, a lot of things like that.</span> <span id="s196">But I had lot more freedom than I had in Berlin.</span> <span id="s197">I mean Berlin was a big city and playing out in the street was impossible.</span> <span id="s198">And it -- it - - it was a very different life.</span> <span id="s199">It was a certain kind of freedom and relaxation.</span> <span id="s200">I didn't have a nurse or a governess with me all the time.</span> <span id="s201">I could go, you know -- I wasn't supposed to, but I go more or less where I wanted to.</span> <span id="s202">And it was a more relaxed life.</span> <span id="s203">It was very hard for my mother, although I didn't hear her ever complain.</span> <span id="s204">And my -- I have a cousin who came to visit the other day from Holland and she's much younger.</span> <span id="s205">She was much younger than my mother, and she said that my mother never complained.</span> <span id="s206">Never!</span> <span id="s207">Never!</span> <span id="s208">And -- my mother -- I mean she'd had a -- a cook, a cleaning woman, a maid, a nurse for governess for us.</span> <span id="s209">You know, she never had anything like that to do.</span> <span id="s210">She did that social work.</span> <span id="s211">That's what people did.</span> <span id="s212">And of course, not for pay.</span> <span id="s213">I mean she did social work and now she had to learn to cook.</span> <span id="s214">My mother never knew had to cook.</span> <span id="s215">So she -- her mother was there.</span> <span id="s216">My -- my grandmother had gone to Holland before my -- my -- my parents and she taught my mother how to cook because my mother didn't know how.</span> <span id="s217">And she -- she had -- I think she had some help every day for a few hours, but that was -- I mean for her, it must have been an enormous change.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">An apartment, it had two stories but it was still a relatively small apartment compared to what she used to have and -- Of course, she was surrounded by family which she had not -- never had her own family.</span> <span id="s219">She had a lot of my father's family, but never much of her own.</span> <span id="s220">And here it was very different.</span> <span id="s221">And because the family was Dutch, of course, we slid very fast into the Dutch way of life and aside from my father and my mother and for the children, it was very nice.</span> <span id="s222">So I loved it in -- in Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: You had again the friends of the children you played with these photographs that you showed us of all of you in a sandbox.</span> <span id="s224">and the more famous of one actually shows Ann Frank in there, but all of you were together.</span> <span id="s225">Can you tell us about the children in that sandbox.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">What were you doing and what was it like?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: Well, we had -- I think we had a -- I don't remember now exactly, but my cousin she's now called Tamera Cidor, but her name was Dolly Citreon .</span> <span id="s228">And -- and she was visiting and we took her over to other family of ours who lived also on the , who lived downstairs so they had a garden.</span> <span id="s229">And they had also a little baby or a brother.</span> <span id="s230">She was now l years old.</span> <span id="s231">Hanna too -- Hanna was her name.</span> <span id="s232">And we went over there to play, so there was my -- myself, my sister, Dolly, my cousin, and Hanna, Tobby, and we were a family.</span> <span id="s233">And then Hanna and Ann Frank also came because they were friends of my sisters.</span> <span id="s234">So we were all playing there in the garden.</span> <span id="s235">And then my mother came and said, "I'm going to take - let me take a picture of all of you because we're together here.”</span> <span id="s236">And she took what is now known as the sandbox picture.</span> <span id="s237">And Ann is in there.</span> <span id="s238">Then later on she says, "Well now -- no - only the family.”</span> <span id="s239">Oh, the poor kids -- I can hear it.</span> <span id="s240">So.</span> <span id="s241">.</span> <span id="s242">uh Ann and Hanna -- Hanna -- .</span> <span id="s243">Hanna went away and we put the baby between us on -- at the -- on the table, and you have that picture.</span> <span id="s244">She took that picture.</span> <span id="s245">On the second tape that you have, there is the mother of Hanna, now of course much older, and she said she took the picture.</span> <span id="s246">I was so surprised.</span> <span id="s247">I couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s248">My mother took the picture.</span> <span id="s249">It's in my album and it's a long time ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Even so, one could confused.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: Sure you could.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: Yal.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: You -- you said before that your sister, Susannah, was friends with Ann Frank.</span> <span id="s254">A: Yal.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: Can you tell us the kinds of things that they did?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: Well, to my great surprise it seems they were much closer than -- than I had thought because again this cousin from Holland who came to visit recently and who told that my mother was -- was never complaining and working very hard and really wasn't very strong, she was telling me that my sister, Susannah, used to bring Anna -- Ann Frank with her every time they came to visit.</span> <span id="s257">And they would visit in -- in The Hague, and they would visit in Glebare, where they had a little summer house, and they would stay for weeks and she describes on the tape, which by the way, I do have but I didn't bring with me she describes how difficult Anna was.</span> <span id="s258">And she says how -- now they were older then.</span> <span id="s259">I think -- let me see -- I'm -- I was 16 so my sister was 13, and Anna was maybe 12 at that time.</span> <span id="s260">So this is a later period that we are actually talking about now.</span> <span id="s261">And she describes that Anna was so very much more developed than my sister.</span> <span id="s262">Although my sister was only a year older, and how her interests were so very difficult and how difficult it was to keep her calm and interested and uncomplaining and -- and just regular you know.</span> <span id="s263">It's a very cute tape actually that little piece of it about Ann.</span> <span id="s264">It -- it was amazing to -- to most people, you know.</span> <span id="s265">I mean the book is, but - but I could see a little bit of that I could see that she was thinking about many things.</span> <span id="s266">She thought about boys way before Susie ever dreamed of boys.</span> <span id="s267">And -- and she -- she would tell me that Susie is really very childish.</span> <span id="s268">Susie would say to me, "Ann is just silly.</span> <span id="s269">Always with these boys.</span> <span id="s270">Who watches that," she says.</span> <span id="s271">You know, she didn't want to play.</span> <span id="s272">So that's why I was surprised when I heard that at the very end even Ann would go with Susie visiting of -- our family and stuff.</span> <span id="s273">Yal.</span> <span id="s274">The families were very close.</span> <span id="s275">I mean it was due to the fact that it got -- .</span> <span id="s276">they're at the time and they were in the same same age more or less.</span> <span id="s277">The children were the same age.</span> <span id="s278">The interests were a lot alike.</span> <span id="s279">My father was a lawyer and -- and Otto, of course, had a business.</span> <span id="s280">I don't know if my father worked for him or anything or if he did any of his work, but I'm sure he helped him if there were any problems.</span> <span id="s281">So there were a lot of -- a lot of reasons that our families were close.</span> <span id="s282">One forgets, you know.</span> <span id="s283">One forgets how -- how logical these things develop.</span> <span id="s284">There's nothing special.</span> <span id="s285">On that other tape that I gave you, Barry Spaanyard keeps asking the mother of Hanna -- Hanna's mother -- keeps saying, "Now how come you didn't know Anna so well?</span> <span id="s286">Anna's family.</span> <span id="s287">How come you didn't know the Frank's so well?</span> <span id="s288">Or how come you didn't -- " And she finally gets impatient with him and she said, "Well, we were families with the Ledermann's and it was just through them that Anna Frank came to play with us.”</span> <span id="s289">They were not that friendly.</span> <span id="s290">I mean it's just -- why should be friend -- nobody is friendly with everybody.</span> <span id="s291">So there was no special reason or dislike or like or anything.</span> <span id="s292">You know, people know each other or they don't know each other.</span> <span id="s293">So that's was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: What.</span> <span id="s295">.</span> <span id="s296">what were the the Frank parents like.</span> <span id="s297">Otto --</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: Uh Well, I said already, you know, how fantastic Otto was.</span> <span id="s299">He was wonderful with children.</span> <span id="s300">He was just incredible with children.</span> <span id="s301">He was patient.</span> <span id="s302">He was loving.</span> <span id="s303">He was everything you sort of wanted somebody -- he was also patient with this whole situation -- with the fact that he had to leave all of a sudden.</span> <span id="s304">I'm sure they came from the kind of background we did -- and they were reduced to what we were.</span> <span id="s305">I think they would probably this was very much the same.</span> <span id="s306">It was very much the same.</span> <span id="s307">He was very patient with it, and he worked very hard in his business, and he did well for the short time, you know, that -- that he had it.</span> <span id="s308">And now the mother -- I don't have that much of an impression of her.</span> <span id="s309">I can see her.</span> <span id="s310">And, again, I see this beautiful woman.</span> <span id="s311">I mean the eyes, and the hair, and just a beautiful woman.</span> <span id="s312">And, of course, I'm looking at her now not the way a child would.</span> <span id="s313">You know, I'm looking at her from my point of view now.</span> <span id="s314">And I realize what in the world she went through.</span> <span id="s315">I mean for a woman -- she came from the way my mother was -- had been and -- and she didn't have the the .</span> <span id="s316">She had to stay in the house with children and deal with every day things -- her own shopping, doing her grocery, her own cooking, her own -- It was very different from the way she was brought up.</span> <span id="s317">Anyway, she was not as patient.</span> <span id="s318">She didn't have the patience for Ann who was really extremely difficult.</span> <span id="s319">I mean I wasn't easy at all, but Ann was impossible practically.</span> <span id="s320">I mean she was she was difficult.</span> <span id="s321">And -- and -- Edith did not have that -- .</span> <span id="s322">the patience for her.</span> <span id="s323">She did what she could.</span> <span id="s324">She was not a nasty mother or an angry mother or hitting mother or anything.</span> <span id="s325">She would -- she did what she could and Ann was very luck to have Otto and -- and to calm the waters between her and her mother.</span> <span id="s326">So it was a happy family really.</span> <span id="s327">And Otto had to work hard to keep Edith happy and to .</span> <span id="s328">to keep everything going.</span> <span id="s329">And, of course, Margaret did her best.</span> <span id="s330">She was more like her father.</span> <span id="s331">And it was a happy family.</span> <span id="s332">And we saw a lot of them.</span> <span id="s333">All the time!</span> <span id="s334">I just read a book, which I gave to you.</span> <span id="s335">The one on the and in the book, it tells something about Edith, and that's it's the most amazing thing.</span> <span id="s336">They interviewed -- the people who wrote the book, the writers, interviewed two women who had been saved from -- in Auschwitz -- from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s337">And what had happened was, of course, they got ill like everybody else.</span> <span id="s338">I don't know if it was typhoid or diphtheria or one of those horrible diseases, and she said there were two women who didn't give a hoot about what -- whether they would be punished or not punished or whatever they did, and they were very strong.</span> <span id="s339">And they knew that that one of the barracks in Auschwitz -- that everybody had already been sent away.</span> <span id="s340">And they put these two girls in those empty barracks, and they stole food and they gave -- fed them, and they took care of them, and they survived because of these two women.</span> <span id="s341">And one of them was Edith Frank.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">And I don't think that.</span> <span id="s343">.</span> <span id="s344">that there's anybody who knew about that, because I had never heard anything like it.</span> <span id="s345">And I wonder if Otto knowed, because the book just came out now.</span> <span id="s346">And I don't know if -- you know, he'd dead.</span> <span id="s347">I don't know if he ever knew how fantastic she was.</span> <span id="s348">She found her -- she found her feet -- her sea legs, you know.</span> <span id="s349">And she -- she -- she decided, you know -- she didn't see her own kids, so she decided: Go for it!</span> <span id="s350">She did it.</span> <span id="s351">And I'm very happy to hear that.</span> <span id="s352">I sort of heard the same sort of thing about my mother and she -- .</span> <span id="s353">not about Auschwitz, because I don't know what happened to my mother in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s354">But I have a friend who got relieved from -- I think it was from Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s355">She had a sister in Sweden.</span> <span id="s356">This was Anna Marie Rosenbaum.</span> <span id="s357">And Anna Marie had a sister in Sweden, and this -- and she.</span> <span id="s358">.</span> <span id="s359">they got exchanged.</span> <span id="s360">She got exchanged, I think, for Germans who had -- I don't know exactly how it all got together.</span> <span id="s361">Anyway, she managed to get exchanged, and she got to Sweden.</span> <span id="s362">And, of course, she had -- had it very tough in Sweden.</span> <span id="s363">She had to work as a maid for years and things like that.</span> <span id="s364">Nevertheless, she made it through.</span> <span id="s365">And Anna Marie had talked to my mother in Westerborg, and my mother had told Anna Marie that when it was -- if she ever got out of this alive, she was going to go to the university and become a professional social worker and she was going to make a life of her own and she finally decided to do something for herself.</span> <span id="s366">Something that was important for her rather than just working for the family and doing what my father wanted and -- The fellow who saved my life and myself -- one of the reason we didn't end up married after the war was that we had the most terrible fights.</span> <span id="s367">And one of the fights was about the fact that he would say that my father murdered my whole family and my -- because by not wanting to go underground -- He had gotten papers for my mother and my sister and my father -- this friend of mine.</span> <span id="s368">His name was Monfred.</span> <span id="s369">Monfred had gotten papers for all of us.</span> <span id="s370">I had it way before from somebody else, but he also got papers for the rest.</span> <span id="s371">And my mother had given him the mother for it, so he could get it for her.</span> <span id="s372">And, of course, they didn't use it.</span> <span id="s373">I will tell later, you know, how -- how this all came about.</span> <span id="s374">But they didn't use it.</span> <span id="s375">But Monfred used to say, "He killed your mother.</span> <span id="s376">He killed your mother.”</span> <span id="s377">You know, and I would -- I mean we were young.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Right?</span> <span id="s379">I was like 18 -- 17 or 18.</span> <span id="s380">I -- I -- no, you didn't -- and I practically would even scratch him and fight and argue and -- Now, I -- I mean it's impossible to point blame.</span> <span id="s381">I mean it's impossible.</span> <span id="s382">But I think women now would have thought a little bit more for themselves -- maybe for herself.</span> <span id="s383">Maybe she would have said -- a woman now would have said, "Well, my dear.</span> <span id="s384">As much as I hate it, you know, you do your thing.</span> <span id="s385">But this is my life.</span> <span id="s386">And this is my child's life, and we are staying.</span> <span id="s387">We are taking a chance.”</span> <span id="s388">My father -- he was older than my mother.</span> <span id="s389">And he was more staid, and he was -- and she wouldn't leave him.</span> <span id="s390">I mean when it came to it, she went along.</span> <span id="s391">And when she went, my sister went, who was only 14 then, you know, although I had told her -- we all had told her, you know, that we would take care of her and we had a place for her and all that kind of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: Let's see if we can get this in the -- in some sequence.</span> <span id="s393">A: It would be better to have it in sequence.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: Let's go back and do it and so we know what happened.</span> <span id="s395">You've had this child -- you're growing up.</span> <span id="s396">We're coming to the late ‘30s.</span> <span id="s397">Tell us what happened as the war came closer.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: Well, as far as I was concerned, until the Germans walked into Holland, I didn't know very much about anything.</span> <span id="s399">I mean I knew that there was Hitler and that Germany was for us, you know.</span> <span id="s400">Things were bad.</span> <span id="s401">But I was just playing and going to school and dancing and having a good, you know, a good time.</span> <span id="s402">And then one day there was -- the radio started talking and -- and then we heard this lot of noise and we heard the bombardment of Rotterdam.</span> <span id="s403">We heard it all the way in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s404">I mean it was just -- the planes, the low hum of the planes, and the wait of it.</span> <span id="s405">And I remember standing at the window and my father, you know -- the Germans were marching in right through our street which was the main street in .</span> <span id="s406">It now has a different name, but it was then.</span> <span id="s407">I see them singling marching in you know, marching into, over the into the through the toward the center of the town.</span> <span id="s408">And my father standing in the window and saying to me, "Take care of your mother.”</span> <span id="s409">I was 15.</span> <span id="s410">Take care of the -- your mother.</span> <span id="s411">You know, they'll come for me tomorrow.</span> <span id="s412">And my -- my father was not political.</span> <span id="s413">He'd never been political.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">And that's probably.</span> <span id="s415">.</span> <span id="s416">that's one of the things I'd like to talk about -- about the intellectuals in Germany who felt that they were too good to talk politics.</span> <span id="s417">To talk politics was a terrible thing, and you didn't talk.</span> <span id="s418">It was for -- for who -- not very good people.</span> <span id="s419">I mean you couldn't - you shouldn't talk politics, you know.</span> <span id="s420">So they didn't.</span> <span id="s421">And it's we all must be involved and.</span> <span id="s422">.</span> <span id="s423">and fight against things that are bad now, you know, so it doesn't -- terrible things don't happen later.</span> <span id="s424">But that's not what they did.</span> <span id="s425">And then -- so he thought he was going to be picked up tomorrow.</span> <span id="s426">Of course, it took a year and a half, but, you know, it did happen in the end.</span> <span id="s427">The -- the first thing that happened, well, many terrible things happened then.</span> <span id="s428">People started -- Jews starting jumping out of windows and out of -- of balconies and -- and into -- killed themselves with gas and I remember standing on the balcony.</span> <span id="s429">We lived on the third floor, and the balcony was on the back of the house and -- and there was a center which had the -- had the gardens in -- in the bottom and then balconies everywhere, three stories high.</span> <span id="s430">And I remember a man being saved from trying to gas himself and him yelling and screaming I don't want to.</span> <span id="s431">Don't do this.</span> <span id="s432">Don't do this, you know.</span> <span id="s433">Don't save me, you know.</span> <span id="s434">I want to die.</span> <span id="s435">I want to die, you know.</span> <span id="s436">And I was 15.</span> <span id="s437">I mean this made a helluva impression on me.</span> <span id="s438">And I said to me mother, "What -- why does he want to die?"</span> <span id="s439">You know, I mean who wants to die?</span> <span id="s440">And then there was -- I mean a period there where people it wasn't one or two -- that's what I want to say.</span> <span id="s441">It was heaps of people killed themselves.</span> <span id="s442">And then my parents told me it's because they're Jews and -- and Hitler, you know, doesn't like Jews and it was the first time I was really aware of -- We're weren't religious so we'd never had any kind of -- or very little connection with it, although my grandparents, I think, were.</span> <span id="s443">And I remember going to temple with my grandfather when he was still alive and in -- in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">He died in early -- in Berlin while we still living in Berlin.</span> <span id="s445">And I remember it being a happy experience.</span> <span id="s446">He put me on his back.</span> <span id="s447">It was the -- I -- what -- what is the day when when they finish reading the Torah and they start over.</span> <span id="s448">Which one?</span> <span id="s449">Whatever.</span> <span id="s450">And he put me on his back and they danced around, you know, and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s451">I -- it was pretty wonderful.</span> <span id="s452">And I remember him laying the Tefillin and I never knew what it meant and and we had Christmas at home.</span> <span id="s453">I remember the Christmas tree in Berlin was great, with the real candles and the applies and the and the nuts and the the gifts for.</span> <span id="s454">.</span> <span id="s455">for the maids and for everybody, you know.</span> <span id="s456">Everybody had gifts and presents.</span> <span id="s457">Took my mother two months to get ready for Christmas.</span> <span id="s458">And I don't remember Hanukkah in Germany at all.</span> <span id="s459">And I don't remember it really until the Germans came into Holland.</span> <span id="s460">Then that year -- and I think it was the Frank's also -- I think we -- we joined for the first time a reformed temple.</span> <span id="s461">I remember the Rabbi’s name.</span> <span id="s462">His name was Malhe, and that was spelled with a E, not an A. And I remember him so -- so clearly, and I even learned to read a little bit of Hebrew which I have entirely forgotten because it only lasted a year.</span> <span id="s463">And my sister also went there, and I think Margaret and Ann and -- and quite a lot of.</span> <span id="s464">.</span> <span id="s465">of people.</span> <span id="s466">That was the occasion.</span> <span id="s467">I mean once the Hitler didn't shove us back into the old mold of life.</span> <span id="s468">And it made a big difference in any case.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: What was your question?</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: You're doing just fine.</span> <span id="s471">Just tell us what happened now.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s473">School.</span> <span id="s474">We went to school and we had a headmaster who was very anti-Nazi.</span> <span id="s475">And much too outspoken.</span> <span id="s476">I mean nobody knew what to do and how to behave in those days.</span> <span id="s477">There was one group who knew a little bit and that was the communists.</span> <span id="s478">But I didn't -- didn't know anything about communists, but they were the ones who knew already a little bit because they had had some people who had escaped from camps in German, you know.</span> <span id="s479">That was possible to escape.</span> <span id="s480">I mean at the very beginning in 1940, ‘41, people could escape from camps in Germany.</span> <span id="s481">And these -- these communists had already been picked up in Germany, put in camps, and they had come through Holland and they had told a little bit of what they had seen and what they had heard.</span> <span id="s482">And so they informed their Dutch friends -- the Dutch communists, a little bit about things -- what things were like.</span> <span id="s483">So the communists were a little bit prepared, but nobody else was prepared in Holland.</span> <span id="s484">And</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: What happened to you?</span> <span id="s486">You started to say --</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: The school.</span> <span id="s488">The school.</span> <span id="s489">Well, the -- the headmaster called assembly and made a large, big speech about the fact that, you know, about the Germans and that we were a free country and we shall remain free and we all sang the song, you know, the national anthem, and.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Anyway, he got picked up very early, and he died very early because that was -- somebody, of course, told on him.</span> <span id="s491">They were fascists in the schools.</span> <span id="s492">And then one started to hear about fascists right and left.</span> <span id="s493">And one started to hear about our neighbors downstairs who turned out to be not too good, and then we suddenly started to hear things like our neighbors on the other side -- well, he was Jewish, but she was not.</span> <span id="s494">Boy, they're lucky.</span> <span id="s495">I mean things like that, you know, which you'd never -- I'd never thought they were lucky.</span> <span id="s496">I -- you know, I mean, they're know different from us, and weird things -- weird things like that.</span> <span id="s497">As far as the school was concerned, I think we could go to school for a little while, but then, again, there was an assembly and we were told that the Jewish kids now had to leave the school and go to a -- a Jewish school, and have be separated from the others.</span> <span id="s498">And I went to my parents and -- and I said, "I don't want to go to a Jewish school.</span> <span id="s499">I'm not going to a Jewish school.</span> <span id="s500">I will not go to a Jewish school.”</span> <span id="s501">And I can just see my children coming to me and saying I'm not going to go to this school.</span> <span id="s502">You know, I can just see the shock.</span> <span id="s503">I -- it was impossible.</span> <span id="s504">I was really impossible.</span> <span id="s505">I got to be very, very rebellious in every way, and I would not go to school.</span> <span id="s506">My sister did.</span> <span id="s507">She went to a Jewish school.</span> <span id="s508">And it was very frightening because what the Germans started to do is to isolate the Jews into various groups.</span> <span id="s509">I mean they -- at a later date, not right then in the beginning, but at a later date, they would go and pick up the kids in the school, and then make the parents come to get the kids and, of course, keep the parents and that was the end of that you know.</span> <span id="s510">Some people were then sent home again if their parents had good papers, you know some kind of exceptional papers.</span> <span id="s511">But I was -- every time I heard that the school -- the Germans or -- or green police or the Dutch cooperators -- the Nazis, the Dutch Nazi, and anaspears.</span> <span id="s512">They were called then anaspears marching toward the school, you know, I would run to that school and finally after I had Monfred as a friend, he said to me, "The one thing you do when the Germans go somewhere is not go there.”</span> <span id="s513">You know, I mean I was so stupid, but we all -- most of us were because what did we know, you know, about how to save yourself and that you had to save yourself.</span> <span id="s514">You had to be careful.</span> <span id="s515">You have to learn to be scared.</span> <span id="s516">And I was not that scared.</span> <span id="s517">You know, I was dumb.</span> <span id="s518">I was plain old dumb.</span> <span id="s519">But it was very frightening to have my sister in a Jewish school separated in the eastern part of Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s520">We lived in the south and they had to go to Oster, Amsterdam -- Amsterdam ost .</span> <span id="s521">to school.</span> <span id="s522">Most of my friends did do that.</span> <span id="s523">Most of my friends that were Jewish did go to school.</span> <span id="s524">Some of them were picked up, and their parents and them shipped off.</span> <span id="s525">Others, somehow, survived, you know, just like me.</span> <span id="s526">You never know what's going to happen to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: What did you do during the day?</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: I went -- I had to go to school.</span> <span id="s529">And I wanted -- I told you I wanted to be a dancer.</span> <span id="s530">And there was school ran by Alice Kayser in Amsterdam, in .</span> <span id="s531">And she had a dancing school as well, where you learned other things as well.</span> <span id="s532">So it was -- it was recognized as a school.</span> <span id="s533">And my Uncle Paul came and talked my parents into into letting me go.</span> <span id="s534">He was always my savior in that respect because he had -- .</span> <span id="s535">my father was just adamant I was going to go to a academic school.</span> <span id="s536">He didn't understand what was going on at all.</span> <span id="s537">I don't know if it was a wish dream, if it was something he didn't want to understand, or whether it was just incomprehensible to him because he had been raised in a human -- humanitarian fashion and the Germans he knew were like that.</span> <span id="s538">He knew many, many good Germans, and, of course, there were many, many good Germans.</span> <span id="s539">What -- but they -- they didn't have any power.</span> <span id="s540">So my father had trouble to understand and to -- he had great trouble to go along and make wise decisions in regard to the situation which -- which deteriorated from day to day.</span> <span id="s541">the first thing that happened was that the Germans took the German passport that my father had, so he had no nationality.</span> <span id="s542">He was stateless.</span> <span id="s543">We had applied for Dutch citizenship.</span> <span id="s544">You had to be there five years or I forget how many years before you could apply for Dutch citizenship and it's going to be granted in May of 1940.</span> <span id="s545">And the Germans got there just a bit too fast.</span> <span id="s546">It -- this is very bad for me later on, because the Dutch -- dear Dutch after the war when, you know, my parents were dead.</span> <span id="s547">I was alone and they would not give me the Dutch citizenship, because they said your father applied, not you -- that your father applied.</span> <span id="s548">Now at the time, I was under 16 and if you were under 16 the whole family was all naturalized at the same time.</span> <span id="s549">But after the war, you know, I was nearly 20 and I was so called a grown-up and I had to apply for myself and they -- even though, you know, I went through all this S-H-I-T, and they would not give me that citizenship.</span> <span id="s550">They sent me back the money.</span> <span id="s551">My father had paid 200 Gilden, and they sent it back I mean the bureaucracy was just so incredible.</span> <span id="s552">There were many other things which I'll tell when we get to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: Let's get back.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s555">So anyway, the school was -- I went to Alice Kayser, and I went there for -- as long as my parents were there and could pay for it.</span> <span id="s556">I went to Alice Kayser.</span> <span id="s557">In the end she was also taken away.</span> <span id="s558">And then that part of my life was over.</span> <span id="s559">My grandmother -- and I don't know the exact date now -- it was 19 -- it must be ‘42 my grandmother had a home for elderly people.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">These were old people who brought their own furniture and their own things.</span> <span id="s561">They were -- and she had nurses.</span> <span id="s562">It was like -- what would you call it now?</span> <span id="s563">A home for the elderly I mean.</span> <span id="s564">and she ran it.</span> <span id="s565">It was her.</span> <span id="s566">I mean she set it up.</span> <span id="s567">She -- she had to make -- to earn money and and this is what she did.</span> <span id="s568">She had help, of course.</span> <span id="s569">And one day they came and took everybody including her.</span> <span id="s570">They had just emptied out the place.</span> <span id="s571">The Germans they had came.</span> <span id="s572">And my mother was beside herself -- beside herself.</span> <span id="s573">What to do?</span> <span id="s574">We had to get her back.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Now the youngest brother, my mother's youngest brother was -- lived in France, and if you want to, I can tell that story.</span> <span id="s576">But he lived in France.</span> <span id="s577">The older brother lived in The Hague, near The Hague in Gosmer and had no funds, you know, whatsoever.</span> <span id="s578">So my mother went and took our jewelry to a jeweler.</span> <span id="s579">She got in touch with a guy named Putcomer, who was known to mediate between Germans and other people and -- to get people free.</span> <span id="s580">And he said to her that she had to give industrial -- the Germans would take industrial diamonds for my grandmother.</span> <span id="s581">Well, my mother went and gave to Nave who was a jeweler, her jewelry and said, "I need industrial diamonds.</span> <span id="s582">Just see what you can do.”</span> <span id="s583">And Nave came back and said there are no more industrial -- you know, Holland was closed up and -- there were other people besides us that were looking for that -- industrial diamonds and -- and he didn't have any more.</span> <span id="s584">So Putcomer told the Germans.</span> <span id="s585">The Germans came back and said we will take gold bullion -- gold bars, thick gold bars.</span> <span id="s586">So my mother said to Nave, "It's gold bars.</span> <span id="s587">Get us gold bars.”</span> <span id="s588">And then Nave managed to make or get or somehow gold bars, using my mother's jewelry as payment.</span> <span id="s589">And I remember that one day after my class at -- was it after class -- I think -- well, whenever I was told to go on my bicycle and pick up a package from Nave.</span> <span id="s590">And I had -- I had two bags, you know, these -- these Dutch bicycles -- these black bicycles with a -- with the saddle bags.</span> <span id="s591">In one side was my books and the other side was -- was -- the gold bouillon.</span> <span id="s592">And Nave just handled them to me.</span> <span id="s593">I think he wrapped him.</span> <span id="s594">Not very much.</span> <span id="s595">I saw them.</span> <span id="s596">And I brought them to my mother.</span> <span id="s597">And my mother gave them to Mr. Putcomer and Mr. Putcomer gave them to the Germans and my grandmother got out.</span> <span id="s598">And she then, of course, she couldn't live in her house because that was -- they closed the house then.</span> <span id="s599">So she came and lived with us.</span> <span id="s600">And it was terrible.</span> <span id="s601">I mean, for my mother.</span> <span id="s602">It was extremely hard to have another mouth to feed.</span> <span id="s603">It was very -- it started -- you had to start buying on the black market.</span> <span id="s604">It was starting to be very difficult.</span> <span id="s605">I don't know if we already had ration coupons at this time or not but any case and my mother was so worried about my grandmother -- that she would be sick.</span> <span id="s606">She was in pretty good shape, but she was a tyrannical old lady.</span> <span id="s607">And I can just see my poor mother between my father, who was so scared he was starting to get heart trouble and a little ulcer and -- and trying to keep us kids calm and trying to run the house and trying to get the food on the table and we -- it must have been -- and she started to get very, very thin.</span> <span id="s608">I mean my mother got very thin.</span> <span id="s609">And I -- I was very busy with myself.</span> <span id="s610">I was discovering boys and I was 16 and, you know, I..</span> <span id="s611">and but I even noticed she was getting very, very thin.</span> <span id="s612">And I -- I loved her to distraction.</span> <span id="s613">I mean she was my one solid -- my, you know, and -- and so was my father except I started to see he was scared and that was very scary.</span> <span id="s614">Well, where were we?</span> <span id="s615">So anyway</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: Your grandmother has gotten out.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: The grandmother came back.</span> <span id="s618">Yal.</span> <span id="s619">That -- So one day my tyrannical smart, but what do you call it when you -- impulsive grandmother said, I have to get some of my paintings.</span> <span id="s620">I have to get some of my rugs.</span> <span id="s621">I have to get some of my this, and I have to get my silver and my -- Else, you need it, she said to my mother.</span> <span id="s622">You should have it.</span> <span id="s623">I mean why should the German get it.</span> <span id="s624">What the Germans used to do was after they took everybody out of the house, they would go and take all the furniture and whatever was there and I am -- I don't know what they did with it.</span> <span id="s625">I think they probably later on gave it to the people who were bombed out, or they gave it to Goering and he took what he wanted and then gave it to -- I mean I just don't know where the stuff went.</span> <span id="s626">But my grandmother went, without telling my mother, went to her house.</span> <span id="s627">Of course, she had the key and she went in and, of course, the house was being watched, and my grandmother was taken again.</span> <span id="s628">And that was it.</span> <span id="s629">I mean there was no jewelry to sell.</span> <span id="s630">and Mr. Putcomer -- my mother starting running around to Putcomer, to this, to that, and she couldn't get my grandmother back out.</span> <span id="s631">And I have letters of hers and I mean which are so -- so touching.</span> <span id="s632">There's just no words for it, you know, I mean, where she says – “Oh, my poor Mooty,” she calls her Mooty, of course, “and Mooty, she doesn't even have a blanket and she doesn't even have a sweater.</span> <span id="s633">I mean she just went there.</span> <span id="s634">Right?</span> <span id="s635">She does have anything, and how am I going to get to her?”</span> <span id="s636">And these letters are also a brother in Voltsneir who couldn't budge.</span> <span id="s637">He couldn't -- Anyway, and she managed, she got to somebody who managed to bring my grandmother a blanket and to bring my grandmother a sweater and to bring her some shoes while she was still in -- on the , there was which was a Jewish theatre.</span> <span id="s638">It was in the Amsterdan Oldst, which had become a Jewish section.</span> <span id="s639">There was a Jewish theatre where -- where plays and musicals and stuff were being performed and that was now used for a collection place for Jews from Amsterdam and that were going to be shipped to Westerborg.</span> <span id="s640">And while my grandmother was still in Westerborg -- sorry -- while she was still in this there, my grand -- my mother managed to get things to her.</span> <span id="s641">People took it in.</span> <span id="s642">I don't know how.</span> <span id="s643">But she managed it.</span> <span id="s644">And she agonized.</span> <span id="s645">And she got thinner and thinner.</span> <span id="s646">And then one horrible thing after another happened.</span> <span id="s647">My Uncle Hans and Ava -- my cousin Ava, who came to visit me just now, told me these stories about Ann that I mentioned.</span> <span id="s648">Hans and Ava who had a little baby did go underground.</span> <span id="s649">And my -- my father was just so upset because he said oh, if they ever find them they will be punished more than the Jews are already punished.</span> <span id="s650">At the time they thought all Jews would go to labor camp and just work, you know.</span> <span id="s651">And my father was very worried about that.</span> <span id="s652">Hans was his favorite cousin and he really was worried about that.</span> <span id="s653">Anyway, Hans and Ava -- You want their story?</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: You -- just very briefly.</span> <span id="s657">In fact, this is a good place to stop.</span> <span id="s658">I think we're going to change tape and then we'll pick up the story again.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q: I'll like to come back to Grandma, would you please.</span> <span id="s663">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: Would you both tell us her name and tell us what happened to her?</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: Her name is Ellen Citreon Sleppe.</span> <span id="s666">Her name is Sleppe.</span> <span id="s667">I think I mentioned her when I spoke about Berlin.</span> <span id="s668">What happened to her was that she was first sent to Westerborg, where she was quite awhile.</span> <span id="s669">She stayed quite awhile, and then she was sent to Bergen-Belsen which was, in a way, not as bad as Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s670">It was bad enough and she did died there.</span> <span id="s671">She died of illness, but the stories that come back about her are fantastic.</span> <span id="s672">Again, this Anna Marie Rosenbaum I talked about earlier who was exchanged to Sweden, she was telling about my grandmother and she actually brought me a little purse which my grandmother -- .</span> <span id="s673">send it to me, which my grandmother had given her.</span> <span id="s674">she said that my grandmother always had some tea.</span> <span id="s675">If it was made out of thistles or if it was made out of anything you know or what I sent -- I -- we did send packages to them in Westerborg.</span> <span id="s676">We managed to do that.</span> <span id="s677">And she had tea and she would have a -- a napkin over an orange crate and she would always have something when people came to visit, and she was always upbeat and she was always brave.</span> <span id="s678">And my grandmother had been a volun -- done voluntary work as a nurse and she was doing that in the camp.</span> <span id="s679">She was 72.</span> <span id="s680">She wasn't old.</span> <span id="s681">And she was extremely energetic, and so when she was sent to Bergen-Belsen, she lasted quite awhile there, but in the end, she did die in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s682">But we heard nothing but nice things about her.</span> <span id="s683">Anyway where shall we go now?</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q: What happened to you?</span> <span id="s685">Grandma has been taken away.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: Grandma has been taken away.</span> <span id="s687">And we are now starting to -- to get -- people my age -- I was -- let's say, I was 16 going on 17 I guess.</span> <span id="s688">The Germans started to call up young Jewish children like me who were 16 and up.</span> <span id="s689">At 16 you were considered a family on your own by the Germans.</span> <span id="s690">And they would call up -- these German -- .</span> <span id="s691">young people by name, not in big , but by name.</span> <span id="s692">And I had many friends who were called up and we used to have -- they had parties before they -- the night before they went, they would have parties and they would sit around and they would say oh, what we're going to do.</span> <span id="s693">We're all going to get together.</span> <span id="s694">It was like , you know, as if they were going to Israel, like it was going to be a -- a summer camp or, you know, a holiday camp or something.</span> <span id="s695">Yes, we going to work very hard, but in the evening we'll put on your lipstick and we'll all be together and we will sing and when the war is over, the Americans will come and we will be saved, you know -- this kind of atmosphere.</span> <span id="s696">Now when I was 16, I needed -- my father worked for the Yotsrat, which was one of the things that gave you a permit to -- it postponed you're being, supposedly, your being taken away.</span> <span id="s697">And when I was 16 I had to get my own security.</span> <span id="s698">I didn't -- I wasn't secure anymore under his permit so I needed a permit of my own.</span> <span id="s699">And they looked around and they looked around and it turned -- I managed -- they managed to get it for me.</span> <span id="s700">I don't know how, but I had to go to work work in Amsterdam Oldst, -- eastern Amsterdam and I got a place in what was called the Cultural Mission and it was to .</span> <span id="s701">I think it was to I am not sure.</span> <span id="s702">That's the one that described in the book, and that's where I met Monfred, and that's where -- I think that's where -- that was the .</span> <span id="s703">Now there it was mostly, perhaps even all, and I'm not sure of that, because I didn't pay attention to it, X-German Jews.</span> <span id="s704">It was - and there was -- they were a lot of communists there.</span> <span id="s705">And that was the first time that I ever heard the word, and that I, you know, ever came near to hearing but there was some kind of organization.</span> <span id="s706">What happened was I had to work -- I worked in organizing courses.</span> <span id="s707">God help us.</span> <span id="s708">Courses for people who were going to be shipped and killed and murdered in various ways which we supposedly didn't know, which -- but what I was -- which I was told by the people for the first time are the people in .</span> <span id="s709">They told me -- the young people there -- they were conscious.</span> <span id="s710">They were political, and they were conscious of what was going on and they said to me, "All the young people that you're sitting around with -- you silly goose.</span> <span id="s711">They're all going to be dead within two weeks.”</span> <span id="s712">Now that might have not been true, but that's what they told me.</span> <span id="s713">And I started -- I said that's not true.</span> <span id="s714">I went home and I told my father.</span> <span id="s715">I said you know, I was told that.</span> <span id="s716">And he said, "That's nonsense.</span> <span id="s717">Germans would never do a thing like that.”</span> <span id="s718">And -- and I -- at that time I had met Monfred and I told Monfred and Monfred, who was my friend -- my boyfriend, he was 20 -- .</span> <span id="s719">who became a boyfriend.</span> <span id="s720">Matter of fact, I met him in .</span> <span id="s721">I took courses as well as organizing the classes for others.</span> <span id="s722">And in one of the courses and, of course, on very necessary for people who were going to get killed.</span> <span id="s723">And in a course on I met -- there were two fellows actually that I liked, and one of them was Monfred.</span> <span id="s724">And Monfred and I started going out vaguely if there was such a thing.</span> <span id="s725">I mean he walked me home and, you know, picked me up and we walked.</span> <span id="s726">There was no transportation so we walked to .</span> <span id="s727">And he said to me about this remark of my father's -- Germans wouldn't do a thing like that.</span> <span id="s728">He said, "But your father doesn't know these Germans.</span> <span id="s729">These are not the Germans your father knows -- knew.</span> <span id="s730">These are different Germans.”</span> <span id="s731">He said to me, "Look at the soldiers.</span> <span id="s732">Look at them.</span> <span id="s733">That's the kind of German.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Look at the Nazi.</span> <span id="s735">Don't look at the kind of Germans -- the lawyers and doctors and the kind of people that your father knew in the voluntary organization.</span> <span id="s736">Look at who is running this place.”</span> <span id="s737">And he tried to educate me, you know, to tell me.</span> <span id="s738">It was hard because I believed my father.</span> <span id="s739">You know, I mean he was my everything and I -- I couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s740">But I told my mother.</span> <span id="s741">And my mother said, "Mon might very well be right."</span> <span id="s742">And she said, "Bring him home.”</span> <span id="s743">And I brought Monfred home and he and my mother and my sister became fast friends.</span> <span id="s744">I mean they believed in Monfred, more than I believed in Monfred because I had something to protect.</span> <span id="s745">And so -- but he -- he -- he was everything they said he was, you know.</span> <span id="s746">He was the rock of the ages, and at 20.</span> <span id="s747">He came from a different kind of family also from Germany, but very different.</span> <span id="s748">And he was political from a very, very early age, and so was his -- his sister was less political, but very conscious of the situation.</span> <span id="s749">And anyway Monfred told me that I would be murdered if I -- "If you get called up," he said to me, "you do not go.”</span> <span id="s750">And I said, "That is impossible.</span> <span id="s751">I mean what would happen to my parents if I don't go.”</span> <span id="s752">And Monfred said to me, "Nothing that wouldn't happen otherwise," he said.</span> <span id="s753">And it was terrible.</span> <span id="s754">I mean I said, "What do you mean?"</span> <span id="s755">And he said, "Everyone who goes and gets into their hands will be killed.”</span> <span id="s756">He said, "They are all going to die.”</span> <span id="s757">And I wouldn't believe it and I couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s758">So he took me to a party -- one of those parties with the kids and everybody was sitting around saying we're going tomorrow and rah rah -- and Monfred said to me, "You see this guy over there, Leo Vials?"</span> <span id="s759">"Yes.”</span> <span id="s760">He says, "He's not going.”</span> <span id="s761">I said, "That's impossible.”</span> <span id="s762">He's saying he's going.</span> <span id="s763">He said, "That's what you have to do.</span> <span id="s764">Nobody has to know that he's not going, but he's part of us.</span> <span id="s765">And he is not going.”</span> <span id="s766">And then it took him about three hours to explain to me how anybody could not go, and what you'd do if you don't go.</span> <span id="s767">And -- and how you survive, and where do you get food.</span> <span id="s768">And where do you get money and -- And this was my first acquaintance with the possibility, you know, of not going.</span> <span id="s769">And then in my dance class -- I went after work to a dance class -- I met a fellow named and he had a friend who he told me could get me false papers.</span> <span id="s770">Ike came to me and he said, "It is time for you to start thinking.”</span> <span id="s771">Now he was Dutch.</span> <span id="s772">He was not Jewish -- and he said to me, "It is time for you to start thinking about doing something about not going.”</span> <span id="s773">I said, "Where do you go come on.</span> <span id="s774">Where do you take it.”</span> <span id="s775">He said, "I have a friend who told me all about it.”</span> <span id="s776">He said, "You need paper.”</span> <span id="s777">And he said, "It'll be 300 gilden.”</span> <span id="s778">I remember that.</span> <span id="s779">300 gilden.</span> <span id="s780">That was a lot of money you know.</span> <span id="s781">And I came home and I said to my Mother that I needed the money and she said, "What for?"</span> <span id="s782">And I said, "For the papers.”</span> <span id="s783">And she said, "Tomorrow, when you go back to school you'll have it.”</span> <span id="s784">And those were my first false papers.</span> <span id="s785">And they were very bad.</span> <span id="s786">But they saved my life.</span> <span id="s787">And on the papers -- in -- in those days, at the early days, the -- the false papers were people who died or people who had happened to have really lost them or various ways that you could get papers and what they would do is they would take out the picture of the person -- the original person, and insert your -- your picture and your fingerprint and whatever else they had to change -- to change.</span> <span id="s788">And, of course, these were not papers that had a J on it, which those were identify papers without a J.</span> <span id="s789">They looked very authentic.</span> <span id="s790">Now mine was of a 22 year old girl.</span> <span id="s791">I was 17 maybe and I looked like 13.</span> <span id="s792">Pigtails, little.</span> <span id="s793">So they were unlikely papers.</span> <span id="s794">If anybody really stood there and looked as it said, this girl is 22 years old you know.</span> <span id="s795">So those were my papers.</span> <span id="s796">And I had them.</span> <span id="s797">And then one night -- oh, he also, Monfred also -- then I told Monfred I had the papers and he looked at them and he said, "They're not bad.</span> <span id="s798">They're not bad.</span> <span id="s799">They're very good.</span> <span id="s800">Keep them where you can get to them.”</span> <span id="s801">And then we went to another party, and there he had organized that one of the escaped communists from Germany was there and he took off his shirt and it was, you know, he had welts and -- and x-cuts and I mean it was pretty bad to look at it.</span> <span id="s802">And he -- and this guy told us that, you know, that he'd gotten that in one of the camps, you know, and he had -- I think Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s803">He had escaped and he was, he was telling us about the camps.</span> <span id="s804">And he was telling us about the salt mines and he was telling us about all sorts of things, you know, that and when we were through with that, Monfred said to me, "Do you believe me now?"</span> <span id="s805">I believed him.</span> <span id="s806">I believed him!</span> <span id="s807">And I came home and I said to my father -- I told my father I had the papers, my false papers and I said to him, "I'm not going.</span> <span id="s808">Whenever they call me, "I said, "I'm not going.”</span> <span id="s809">And my father said, "You have to go.”</span> <span id="s810">He said, "What will happen to us.”</span> <span id="s811">And there came this beautiful guilt was put on me like a hood you know, all over.</span> <span id="s812">If you try to save yourself, that's what it meant, you know, we will all die.</span> <span id="s813">Because in that -- in Westerborg, they had various kinds of barracks.</span> <span id="s814">They had barracks for -- the normal barracks for people were picked up normally, and they had barracks that had a big S on it for Straasburger, and in those barracks were the people who had been bad, you know.</span> <span id="s815">And that would -- would be them.</span> <span id="s816">And those people would go on transports first.</span> <span id="s817">They would -- in during the selections.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">I think because I know very well that some of them escaped and some of them got out and some survived just as much I guess.</span> <span id="s819">Maybe a less percentage, but just as much as anybody else, which in Holland wasn't good.</span> <span id="s820">So for months, I tried to live with that, you know, and say, "Okay.</span> <span id="s821">I can't kill my family.”</span> <span id="s822">And my father, he felt he had calmed me down.</span> <span id="s823">And then one night we were sitting on our big window in the living room and we were looking out.</span> <span id="s824">It was -- already it was curfew.</span> <span id="s825">There were curfews at night.</span> <span id="s826">And all of a sudden, we see trucks come out.</span> <span id="s827">Long rows of trucks.</span> <span id="s828">And they're starting at the at the -- at the high rise that you saw in the picture.</span> <span id="s829">On the not on the on where we lived -- and they were coming out.</span> <span id="s830">And I -- I mean I couldn't believe what was happening.</span> <span id="s831">They were pick -- going into every -- the way this -- and the street is set up that they were -- every entrance had steps going up to a platform, and then a wide staircase going up to another platform and on that platform were six apartments.</span> <span id="s832">I think there were six.</span> <span id="s833">And they would -- at that point they did not just pick up everybody, you know.</span> <span id="s834">They -- they came with lists and they picked up people by name and they took -- I know I remember it as today, they picked up old Mrs. Triman Mr. Triman was married to a Gentile lady and he was okay.</span> <span id="s835">But they picked up his mother.</span> <span id="s836">And she could hardly walk.</span> <span id="s837">She was a very old lady, and I -- my stomach -- they were good friends of ours.</span> <span id="s838">My stomach just turned.</span> <span id="s839">They picked up all the people I knew.</span> <span id="s840">And they stopped about two stoops before ours -- two -- you know, two platforms before ours.</span> <span id="s841">And, however, Monfred always knew what was going on.</span> <span id="s842">And he knew -- he lived in another part of town.</span> <span id="s843">And he knew that they were doing our street.</span> <span id="s844">And he sent this Leo Vial that I mentioned -- the guy.</span> <span id="s845">He had good false papers.</span> <span id="s846">He was a German civilian -- German soldier of some sort.</span> <span id="s847">He had -- wore a long leather coat and he was on a motor bike and had hood on.</span> <span id="s848">I mean you can imagine he looked like.</span> <span id="s849">And right in the middle of all this going on, the door bell rang and, of course, we -- my parents thought they were gonna -- I mean I thought I was gonna die and we thought how come.</span> <span id="s850">You know, the trucks aren't this far away.</span> <span id="s851">They aren't at our house yet.</span> <span id="s852">How come?</span> <span id="s853">What's going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s854">And it was Leo Vial, and he came to get me.</span> <span id="s855">Monfred had sent him to get me.</span> <span id="s856">Right in the middle of all this thing going on.</span> <span id="s857">This curfew and everything!</span> <span id="s858">Right?</span> <span id="s859">So I put my false papers in my pocket and I said to my, of course, the J was not on my clothes.</span> <span id="s860">I took it off.</span> <span id="s861">And I said to my father, "Goodbye.”</span> <span id="s862">He grabbed me, and he kicked Leo down the stairs and Leo drove off and told Monfred, "I can't get her.</span> <span id="s863">She -- they won't let her go.</span> <span id="s864">I can't make a fuss.</span> <span id="s865">If I make a fuss, I get arrested.</span> <span id="s866">So I can't, you know, make a fuss.”</span> <span id="s867">So he left and I was left there and, of course, that -- as I said, they stopped two platforms before us so nothing happened to us that night.</span> <span id="s868">But that was -- after the next getting together I went to and I talked to all the people there and they didn't trust me because I was blabber mouth and everything, but they said -- they said to Monfred, "Hide her if you can.”</span> <span id="s869">And that's what happened.</span> <span id="s870">Monfred's father had a factory where they made cosmetics, I think, and soap bottles and all this little stuff, and the first night I spent -- I was hidden in the factory.</span> <span id="s871">And it was right close to Ann Frank were -- the Ann Frank house.</span> <span id="s872">I mean it was on the same kind of a canal.</span> <span id="s873">I don't know if it was on the Frank's house, but it was on one of the canals.</span> <span id="s874">It was the same building, the same situation.</span> <span id="s875">And I stayed there, but they weren't planning for me to stay there.</span> <span id="s876">They couldn't have people stay in that house, so some how Monfred had arranged for me to go to a paisson where the woman didn't know anything about me.</span> <span id="s877">She got my false papers and she thought I was that person and she registered me with the police under that name and the police didn't you know, they just registered me and that was it.</span> <span id="s878">And I lived there and that's where you have the pictures from -- the pictures of Monfred and me.</span> <span id="s879">They were taken in my room at that paisson.</span> <span id="s880">That was -- that was my first underground place.</span> <span id="s881">And I even got mail.</span> <span id="s882">They arranged even for me to get mail so the woman wouldn't get suspicious that I was alone -- a loner and that maybe, you know, there was something wrong with me.</span> <span id="s883">And she got my coupons.</span> <span id="s884">I got food coupons, which Monfred somehow got.</span> <span id="s885">I had everything.</span> <span id="s886">I went to ballet class, a different school, of course, not -- because Alice Kayser had already been picked up, so I went to a different school and I will tell you about that school later, but in any case, I lived a relatively normal life.</span> <span id="s887">I was no more hungry than anybody else and -- and it wasn't so bad then anyway during that early period.</span> <span id="s888">And Monfred and I became very good friends and, you know, I couldn't go to anymore, of course.</span> <span id="s889">I was finished with that part of my life.</span> <span id="s890">I was underground.</span> <span id="s891">My parents were still there.</span> <span id="s892">You know, I forgot -- let's see.</span> <span id="s893">My parents were picked up twice.</span> <span id="s894">And the first time it might have been before I finally left, but I'm not sure.</span> <span id="s895">Maybe it was.</span> <span id="s896">I came home.</span> <span id="s897">It might have been before I finally left.</span> <span id="s898">That was when Ike said, "Now you need papers.”</span> <span id="s899">said -- .</span> <span id="s900">Yes it was before I finally left.</span> <span id="s901">Again, I was sitting -- and was up in the attic with a girl from next door who was half Jewish, and we heard all that noise.</span> <span id="s902">And there was this during the day and the green police were picking up everybody in the street, everybody who was Jewish on that street.</span> <span id="s903">And what they hadn't done -- they hadn't stopped the traffic and they hadn't stopped the trollies.</span> <span id="s904">They hadn't stopped every -- anything.</span> <span id="s905">It was during the day and everything was going on normally and they were just having themselves a little rautsey there.</span> <span id="s906">And I -- the girl next door went over the roof to her house and I went down and my father wasn't home because it was a working day, you know, and I took off the J and I took my false papers and I went -- no, I didn't have false papers.</span> <span id="s907">I had nothing!</span> <span id="s908">That's right.</span> <span id="s909">I had nothing.</span> <span id="s910">And I went down the stairs and again with the pig tail, you know, the whole works.</span> <span id="s911">I came on the lower platform and two German soldiers jumped up on it.</span> <span id="s912">And I was standing there in the middle.</span> <span id="s913">LIttle German girl in pig tails.</span> <span id="s914">Right?</span> <span id="s915">Little bag that said gym class.</span> <span id="s916">And they said to me, "Get the Hell out of here.</span> <span id="s917">We've got work to do" or some kind of thing.</span> <span id="s918">That's what they said.</span> <span id="s919">.</span> <span id="s920">And it -- and I went and then I went on the trolley.</span> <span id="s921">I mean the trolley was running.</span> <span id="s922">I went on the trolley and I went -- I went to -- to Ike mother house -- mother's house.</span> <span id="s923">And he -- they hid me.</span> <span id="s924">And then when he said, "You need false papers.”</span> <span id="s925">That's how it was -- coming back to me.</span> <span id="s926">That's when I got my first false papers.</span> <span id="s927">And his mother hid me for three days and during those three days I kept calling home and finally, of course, I didn't get an answer because they had taken my sister and my -- and my mother, and my father, of course, went there -- there too.</span> <span id="s928">They had taken them in some gym room of a high school where they assembled them.</span> <span id="s929">And at that time my father's paper which said that he was working for the Yotserat and had -- had given him a freedom a permit and he -- and they let him out.</span> <span id="s930">They let my family out.</span> <span id="s931">And that was -- that was the first time they were taken away.</span> <span id="s932">Now, here I'm now going back to where I was in this paission.</span> <span id="s933">My mother at that time -- she had given some things to some Gentile neighbors below us.</span> <span id="s934">She had given silver, some clothes, some valuables -- things that she wanted to keep that she thought might be safer with them in case of an emergency.</span> <span id="s935">She had given things to one of my uncles, Yohan , who later became the head -- the director of the big theatre in Amsterdam after the war.</span> <span id="s936">paintings and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s937">Anyway, I'm in this paission and I'm going to school and everything.</span> <span id="s938">And I hadn't seen my parents for a long time.</span> <span id="s939">We talked over the phone.</span> <span id="s940">I -- I'm very homesick, very homesick.</span> <span id="s941">And they are -- they want to see me.</span> <span id="s942">Right?</span> <span id="s943">And it's -- it's going to be a holiday.</span> <span id="s944">It's something we call , which I think is but I'm not sure.</span> <span id="s945">It was about June 18th that I went there or June 19th, 1942.</span> <span id="s946">And I -- Monfred says to me, "You are crazy.</span> <span id="s947">You should not do such a thing.</span> <span id="s948">You never know what's going to happen, you know.”</span> <span id="s949">I mean nothing has been announced.</span> <span id="s950">He hasn't heard through his sources that anything's going to happen, but you just don't know and it's better not and why should you.</span> <span id="s951">You know, I had to put up a star and -- and a J to go to my -- to go home.</span> <span id="s952">I mean if the neighbors would see me without, you know, I mean, they would know that I was -- it was It was terribly dangerous.</span> <span id="s953">It was stupid.</span> <span id="s954">It was dangerous.</span> <span id="s955">And I did it anyway.</span> <span id="s956">I -- I went to somebody's house, sewed on the J, lightly but I sewed it on, and I went to see my parents and my sister.</span> <span id="s957">And, of course, there was a lot of crying and there was a lot of happiness that we were still there and we were still together and it's now 1943, June 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">And everything goes fine that first evening and then the next morning at six, six o'clock -- in the letter that I wrote later, I write the right time a woman we used to call Cassandra came -- comes up and said, "I just heard.</span> <span id="s959">This whole area is closed off and we're all -- this is the big deal for this area.</span> <span id="s960">All the Jews are going to go.</span> <span id="s961">This is not a little rautsey by name.</span> <span id="s962">This is not by name.</span> <span id="s963">This is everything.</span> <span id="s964">Everybody!"</span> <span id="s965">And I was there.</span> <span id="s966">I was there!</span> <span id="s967">I was caught!</span> <span id="s968">I was -- I couldn't -- I mean it was terrible.</span> <span id="s969">At the same time, you know, I was with my family and if anything happened to them, it would happen to me and this was it, you know.</span> <span id="s970">And my mother said to my father, "Frans, ," which means Frans, she goes.</span> <span id="s971">She has to leave, you know.</span> <span id="s972">And I had my papers.</span> <span id="s973">I had my papers.</span> <span id="s974">Couldn't take a thing.</span> <span id="s975">My father says to me, "Bless you.</span> <span id="s976">Go.</span> <span id="s977">This is the end.</span> <span id="s978">I think this is it.</span> <span id="s979">This really is it.</span> <span id="s980">This is the last time.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">This is it.”</span> <span id="s982">He said, "You go.</span> <span id="s983">You go.</span> <span id="s984">Try it.</span> <span id="s985">Doesn't matter anymore, you know.</span> <span id="s986">Just try it.”</span> <span id="s987">And I didn't even think how fantastic that was, you know, that I had his -- at least at the last moment that he said I agree with you, go.</span> <span id="s988">And not that it lessens the guilt.</span> <span id="s989">Really, it doesn't lessen the guilt of not being with them, you know, not participating in that thing that happened to them.</span> <span id="s990">We had a hiding place in the house which was in the attic where there were two nice rooms in the attic and there was a double wall and we had suitcases.</span> <span id="s991">They used to be called elephants.</span> <span id="s992">They were more like trunks with a rounded top and they were grey, and that's why they're called elephants and on the back of one of those, my mother had made a handle, and she had made a big hole in the wall and you know, Susie -- she promised me she would put Susie in that hole.</span> <span id="s993">And I said to her, we will come and get her, you know.</span> <span id="s994">And you can go in there too.</span> <span id="s995">She had papers.</span> <span id="s996">Monfred had gotten her papers, and had gotten Susie and -- and my father papers.</span> <span id="s997">He said, Monfred had said to me, "You father will never use them, but I don't want to have it on my conscious that he can't if he needs to, you know," and so as I left, you know, I said to them, "Put Susannah in -- in there, you know, in that hole.</span> <span id="s998">Give her her papers.</span> <span id="s999">Make her pull the thing.</span> <span id="s1000">And you to , you know.”</span> <span id="s1001">All of you.</span> <span id="s1002">Go in there.”</span> <span id="s1003">And -- and, of course, they didn't, I mean.</span> <span id="s1004">They didn't even use it.</span> <span id="s1005">They didn't use the papers.</span> <span id="s1006">They didn't use -- they didn't go in the hole.</span> <span id="s1007">They didn't do anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">Anyway, I went down -- down and it was a beautiful day.</span> <span id="s1009">It was like this morning except cooler you know.</span> <span id="s1010">Sunny, warm, June day in Holland.</span> <span id="s1011">So beautiful.</span> <span id="s1012">Little clouds and -- It's so easy to close a neighborhood off in Holland in Amsterdam because there are water everywhere.</span> <span id="s1013">Right!</span> <span id="s1014">All you have to do is stand on the bridges.</span> <span id="s1015">Just stand on the bridges.</span> <span id="s1016">You can stop anybody.</span> <span id="s1017">I didn't know where to go.</span> <span id="s1018">I had no where to go.</span> <span id="s1019">I didn't know the bridges were closed off, so I went to the bridges.</span> <span id="s1020">And I went to the first bridge and I saw there was somebody standing in it.</span> <span id="s1021">And then I remembered that there were people from where I had worked who had good hiding places, who were communists, you know, and who would certainly hide a little blonde girl.</span> <span id="s1022">Right?</span> <span id="s1023">So I went there.</span> <span id="s1024">And man, they were so angry.</span> <span id="s1025">They told me I'm stupid.</span> <span id="s1026">I was endangering them.</span> <span id="s1027">How would I dare come to a house, you know, people might be watching me.</span> <span id="s1028">I'm coming into a house -- nobody else is on the street and here's this kid walking down the street and it's coming to their house, and they have to be saved because they later on want to save Germany.</span> <span id="s1029">Right?</span> <span id="s1030">After the war, they want to make into a great communist country.</span> <span id="s1031">Or anyway they want to change Germany into something good, and I was endangering them.</span> <span id="s1032">And away with me!</span> <span id="s1033">That was the end of my communisms if I ever had any.</span> <span id="s1034">I'm telling you I didn't know what it was, but I -- right there, I knew that, you know, these people were no different from anybody else and it's dog eat dog and save yourself and, you know, I didn't think all of that right then.</span> <span id="s1035">I just knew I had no place to go.</span> <span id="s1036">All of a sudden, loud speakers all over the place.</span> <span id="s1037">"All Jews had to prepare themselves.</span> <span id="s1038">Gentiles are not allowed in the streets.”</span> <span id="s1039">Loud and clear.</span> <span id="s1040">All over.</span> <span id="s1041">And I'm in the streets.</span> <span id="s1042">The only person in the street except for those damn people on the bridges.</span> <span id="s1043">Right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">There were no trucks going yet, because they gave them an hour or something to get ready.</span> <span id="s1045">So I was the only one on the street.</span> <span id="s1046">Of course, there were people in the windows, and they saw me.</span> <span id="s1047">Right?</span> <span id="s1048">I was already out of my neighborhood, so it must probable that people who saw didn't know who I was and and I'm walking along and I come to that -- to the first bridge, and there's two soldier, a green soldier, you know, and there is a black anspera on that bridge.</span> <span id="s1049">And I didn't know what to say, you know.</span> <span id="s1050">And I go up there and I say and they say, "What the Hell are you doing.”</span> <span id="s1051">I mean I had -- there was nobody there.</span> <span id="s1052">And I said, "Well, I had come to that part of Amsterdam on the trolley in the morning to go swimming with a girlfriend.</span> <span id="s1053">We were going out far away and -- and anyway, I tell this long story and they look and me and they say, "Boy, you are lying because no trolley has come into this section the entire morning.”</span> <span id="s1054">And I, of course, didn't know that.</span> <span id="s1055">Trolleys start at six and I -- So they said, "If we could get off this bridge, we'd take you to the police, but we're supposed to stand here and we're only ones on the bridge and we can't go anywhere, so -- " They said, "You better get away from here and go home.</span> <span id="s1056">Go back to your girlfriend's house or something.”</span> <span id="s1057">So I went to the next bridge, and the next bridge I already know something you know.</span> <span id="s1058">I know.</span> <span id="s1059">And I say, "While I was staying over with a girlfriend overnight to -- to go swimming in the morning and now I hear all this going on and I think my mother is going to be very worried about me, and I better go back home and I -- I want to get home, and I have to go over there.</span> <span id="s1060">And -- and he said, "Like to make a date for you tonight, but right now, you know, I can't get off the bridge and you can't go over there.</span> <span id="s1061">It's against the rules and I can't -- I can't do it.”</span> <span id="s1062">I'm getting very scared.</span> <span id="s1063">I'm -- because it's only one more bridge that's not too far before they come in with the trucks and I -- I thought what am I going to say?</span> <span id="s1064">What am I going to say?</span> <span id="s1065">And I couldn't think of anything to say.</span> <span id="s1066">And I get to the bridge and there's one German soldier.</span> <span id="s1067">Just a young, German soldier.</span> <span id="s1068">And, again, this total surprise, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">And he says, .</span> <span id="s1070">And I'm crying.</span> <span id="s1071">in German, you know, and I'm crying and he gets all upset.</span> <span id="s1072">You know, he's young.</span> <span id="s1073">He thinks I am his sister no doubt.</span> <span id="s1074">And he says .</span> <span id="s1075">Where is your mother?</span> <span id="s1076">Where is she?</span> <span id="s1077">And I say .</span> <span id="s1078">"Get over there.</span> <span id="s1079">Hurry!"</span> <span id="s1080">That was it.</span> <span id="s1081">Saved by life.</span> <span id="s1082">Sunday, beautiful Sunday over there.</span> <span id="s1083">People going to church.</span> <span id="s1084">Quiet.</span> <span id="s1085">Nothing going on.</span> <span id="s1086">Two streets up nobody knows what's happening one street further.</span> <span id="s1087">I go to Monfred, not to my passion because I'd said I'd be gone for several days and I don't want to suddenly show you up, you know, on a day where there is a rausea in another place, you know.</span> <span id="s1088">So I got to Monfred's house.</span> <span id="s1089">They are sleeping.</span> <span id="s1090">Now, you have to know that Monfred -- he says now, he's not tied in with anything.</span> <span id="s1091">I don't know.</span> <span id="s1092">He always knew.</span> <span id="s1093">He always knew what was going in -- on, and he knew nothing.</span> <span id="s1094">He knew nothing!</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">They had ways to get into closed off areas.</span> <span id="s1096">Again, there were the leather coats and the German accents and the papers.</span> <span id="s1097">They had everything.</span> <span id="s1098">So they tried to get over there, to get my parents, to get their friends.</span> <span id="s1099">They couldn't.</span> <span id="s1100">They couldn't get in.</span> <span id="s1101">This time everything was closed up.</span> <span id="s1102">He couldn't believe it either.</span> <span id="s1103">He just -- we tried everything.</span> <span id="s1104">Just everything.</span> <span id="s1105">Of course, the phones didn't work.</span> <span id="s1106">I heard later that the Jews just came down the steps.</span> <span id="s1107">They just came down the steps.</span> <span id="s1108">And they just climbed on those wagons.</span> <span id="s1109">They helped each other up there, and they sat and they were taken away.</span> <span id="s1110">Now, you have to know that I had many friends.</span> <span id="s1111">I had a friend named Marie Austria, who was a photographer, my teacher -- photography teacher later on, and her sister later on, and she lived on .</span> <span id="s1112">She lived about two of these stoops away from Ann Frank.</span> <span id="s1113">And I had modeled for her.</span> <span id="s1114">She's the one who took all the pictures that you have -- the big ones.</span> <span id="s1115">And she she decided -- she and her sister decided.</span> <span id="s1116">This is big rausea.</span> <span id="s1117">This is a mixed neighborhood.</span> <span id="s1118">How do the -- this is Sunday.</span> <span id="s1119">How do they know who's where?</span> <span id="s1120">Which door is what.</span> <span id="s1121">It's not as if they come with a list.</span> <span id="s1122">They didn't come with a list.</span> <span id="s1123">And so they had a hiding -- the same hiding place that we had.</span> <span id="s1124">You know, in the double wall behind -- with some -- well, I don't know what they had hiding that hole in the wall, but that's where they went.</span> <span id="s1125">They went up.</span> <span id="s1126">They never opened the door when they knocked on their door.</span> <span id="s1127">They didn't open.</span> <span id="s1128">And it was a big rausea, and they didn't break any doors.</span> <span id="s1129">They did nothing.</span> <span id="s1130">They just passed that door up.</span> <span id="s1131">Nobody opened the door.</span> <span id="s1132">It might be people that are away on a trip.</span> <span id="s1133">It's Sunday.</span> <span id="s1134">They -- anyway, in the evening they left.</span> <span id="s1135">And they survived the war.</span> <span id="s1136">I mean -- you know -- it's just -- there were other circumstances that they survived the war and they had other dangers later on.</span> <span id="s1137">But we're talking about that moment of decision.</span> <span id="s1138">That moment!</span> <span id="s1139">That moment of decision.</span> <span id="s1140">One little thing.</span> <span id="s1141">One little thing.</span> <span id="s1142">One decision made.</span> <span id="s1143">I later heard of people -- actually friends of Marie Austria or a friend of Marie Austria, a woman who had been in Auschwitz and had lost most of her teeth, you know, and looked like Hell, and when the Germans left Auschwitz, they walked the people.</span> <span id="s1144">You have heard of that.</span> <span id="s1145">and they walked them and many of them died because of the bombardments on the middle of the road, etc., like that.</span> <span id="s1146">But she -- who was French.</span> <span id="s1147">She was French.</span> <span id="s1148">And she at one corner where all the Germans said, "And now to the right," she went to the left.</span> <span id="s1149">And she survived the war.</span> <span id="s1150">She came home.</span> <span id="s1151">Back to France.</span> <span id="s1152">She found her husband who really -- that was really a story.</span> <span id="s1153">I mean I'm getting off the track here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">Q: Let's -- Let's come back to you.</span> <span id="s1155">Okay?</span> <span id="s1156">A: Yal.</span> <span id="s1157">Yal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">Q: June ‘43, what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">A: Anyway, June 20th, so I went -- I went, after a few days, you know, I went back to my paission.</span> <span id="s1160">I stayed with Monfred and his mother and his sister and her fiance.</span> <span id="s1161">They all lived together in a -- how had they found the place where they were going to survive the war in 91 Valarstraats in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s1162">Monfred's sister, Marga, whose picture you have was a very inventive and a very intelligent, very bright young woman.</span> <span id="s1163">She was -- I don't -- I imagine she was three years or two years older than I was, maybe four.</span> <span id="s1164">I'm not sure.</span> <span id="s1165">But she had always sort of helped support with sewing.</span> <span id="s1166">She was a genius in -- in clothing design and manufacturing.</span> <span id="s1167">And she always was much more practical.</span> <span id="s1168">She wasn't at all a girl who went to school or anything, but she always had her hand in things.</span> <span id="s1169">And she know how to get acquainted with people that were important.</span> <span id="s1170">for her!</span> <span id="s1171">For what she wanted!</span> <span id="s1172">She saw an ad in a paper for the upstairs of a house in the Valarstraat with a family of Anespairs -- actually Dutch fascists.</span> <span id="s1173">And she went there.</span> <span id="s1174">And she said, "We would like that.</span> <span id="s1175">We would very much like that and the apartment, and there will be various number of people because all of us travel.</span> <span id="s1176">We work for the German for the Wehrmacht and we do this and we do that -- you know, speaking German very well.</span> <span id="s1177">And this was a Dutch woman who could not speak German very well.</span> <span id="s1178">Her husband was an Anespair and -- and she and her son were living down stairs while the guy worked for the Germans somewhere in Germany.</span> <span id="s1179">And that's how they got that first apartment.</span> <span id="s1180">So it was a pretty safe place to work -- live if you didn't give it away.</span> <span id="s1181">If not something, you know, you couldn't have assemblies there.</span> <span id="s1182">You couldn't -- you know, you had to take into account what kind of place it was, but all of us, nearly all of us -- of this particular group were not hidden away like Ann Frank was where you couldn't move.</span> <span id="s1183">I mean we all were on the streets.</span> <span id="s1184">It was dangerous, very dangerous.</span> <span id="s1185">I mean I was well known in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s1186">My family was well known in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s1187">It's a small town, you know.</span> <span id="s1188">It's not like now, millions of people.</span> <span id="s1189">You -- you were very well known in your neighborhood.</span> <span id="s1190">And I wasn't in the exact same neighborhood.</span> <span id="s1191">I was still in Amsterdam south, but it was the old south, rather than the new south.</span> <span id="s1192">And I was not as well known there, except by a few people.</span> <span id="s1193">So the way they made your papers, your false papers -- they gave you the same first name that you really had.</span> <span id="s1194">So if somebody would suddenly see you and yell, "Hey, Barbara," it would be okay.</span> <span id="s1195">You don't call each by the last name so you know -- so -- That's my paper -- my name always was Barbara, which was very helpful.</span> <span id="s1196">So that was why I went to see Monfred that night when we after -- or that morning after my parents were taken.</span> <span id="s1197">Anyway, I heard that they were all taken away, and they -- again, they tried to get free with these papers, but the papers were now null and void.</span> <span id="s1198">It was pass the period that these papers would do anything for anybody.</span> <span id="s1199">And they were sent to Westerborg, which is the assembly camp.</span> <span id="s1200">In the -- in the assembly camp was already my cousin Heinz.</span> <span id="s1201">I've told you about him and his wife.</span> <span id="s1202">My cousin Heintz was hidden through the Dutch underground -- some kind of channel.</span> <span id="s1203">The way -- the way it seemed to have happened was all through individuals.</span> <span id="s1204">You knew somebody who knew somebody who knew somebody.</span> <span id="s1205">There wasn't a great big organization where people all knew each other.</span> <span id="s1206">It was one person knew another knew another knew another.</span> <span id="s1207">The less you knew the better, because if you get caught you can give away maybe one person.</span> <span id="s1208">Maybe!</span> <span id="s1209">If you were not tough as nails.</span> <span id="s1210">And this is what happened with my aunt and uncle.</span> <span id="s1211">They -- rather my cousin.</span> <span id="s1212">They were hidden by a -- a Dutch family, and it so happened that the son of that Dutch family also did other things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">Most people who hid people were not allowed to do anything else, but they, of course, didn't know about their son who was receiving weapons which were dropped by the British in Holland for the resistance -- to be used by the resistance in the middle of the night -- .</span> <span id="s1214">planes that flew low, you know, whatever it was.</span> <span id="s1215">And he he was given away by somebody and they came to that house and they took -- they took the men.</span> <span id="s1216">Just the men.</span> <span id="s1217">Not my cousin, my cousin Ava.</span> <span id="s1218">They didn't take her or the wife.</span> <span id="s1219">And Ava was immediately put somewhere else.</span> <span id="s1220">But Heinz was caught and he was then sent to Westerborg as a Jew.</span> <span id="s1221">The -- This other person -- the Gentile survived the war which was a miracle, but he had somebody who got him out in somewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">Q: Let's come back to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">A: To me.</span> <span id="s1224">Okay.</span> <span id="s1225">Well, my Uncle Heintz -- my cousin Heintz was already in -- in Westerborg, and he, of course, he saw his mother.</span> <span id="s1226">He saw my mother.</span> <span id="s1227">He saw my father.</span> <span id="s1228">He saw my sister.</span> <span id="s1229">He saw my grandmother.</span> <span id="s1230">All going through there!</span> <span id="s1231">And Heintz did survive the war in Westerborg.</span> <span id="s1232">There were very, very few people who did.</span> <span id="s1233">There were -- I think there were 300 at the end.</span> <span id="s1234">And he was one of them who survived.</span> <span id="s1235">And they actually kept him in the camp for a little while just to make sure he didn't happen to be -- because of his German, again, his German business.</span> <span id="s1236">But he wasn't a German who was trying to hide as a Jew -- in a Jewish camp, which happened a heck of a lot.</span> <span id="s1237">I mean, any -- later on, it was the Germans who were trying to save their lives and -- and hide and -- and try to stay alive.</span> <span id="s1238">What about me?</span> <span id="s1239">During the war, I must say that most of the war really spent standing in line for food.</span> <span id="s1240">Because of the way I looked I could do that.</span> <span id="s1241">And we had -- we hid a lot of people.</span> <span id="s1242">And that really was -- after reading the book, I realize that it was true, that what the little groups did was try to help themselves and each other staying alive.</span> <span id="s1243">It was less a big picture, you know, that you -- that the underground would attack something or somebody, although I guess that happened, but not with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">Q: Tell us about you!</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">A: About me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">Q: I'm not interested in the book right now.</span> <span id="s1247">Okay?</span> <span id="s1248">I want to know about you and what you did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1250">I stood in line for food.</span> <span id="s1251">I also did a few other things.</span> <span id="s1252">I was -- as -- as I say, they had to be careful with me because I was pretty stupid.</span> <span id="s1253">And I -- they put me to work -- they put me -- I was a dancer.</span> <span id="s1254">Right?</span> <span id="s1255">And there was a ballet company in Amsterdan run by Evan Geeorgi, -- Evan Geeorgi who was a great dancer from somewhere in Germany, and Hamburg or Hanover -- something like that, and she was put by the Germans in into the Dutch large state theater to run the ballet company.</span> <span id="s1256">I went into her ballet school and took classes and I was then asked to join the company.</span> <span id="s1257">And I asked if -- the underground, "Was it alright?"</span> <span id="s1258">"Oh, Yes!"</span> <span id="s1259">Because you got fantastic papers when you went there -- into this company.</span> <span id="s1260">Because the company traveled, you got papers to be out after curfew.</span> <span id="s1261">And that way I could help shift people from one hiding place to another or like American soldiers -- shot down people other people who were underground -- .</span> <span id="s1262">And let me tell you how this was done.</span> <span id="s1263">There were no more trucks, taxis.</span> <span id="s1264">And there were very few cars, because there was no gasoline for them to use.</span> <span id="s1265">So what they had was people on bicycles pulling, you know, like in third world countries, they would pull little wagons behind them.</span> <span id="s1266">Some of them were covered so that when it rained, which it does a lot in Holland, you know, people wouldn't get wet.</span> <span id="s1267">And others were open.</span> <span id="s1268">All sorts of various ways of transportation.</span> <span id="s1269">And the few people that I moved were moved in the middle of the night, you know, I mean after curfew.</span> <span id="s1270">With them being the bench and me sitting, you know, sitting like this bent over and me sitting on top on -- on sitting on their backs with a rather short skirt and my very good papers, with make-up on still from the ballet and when the Germans stuck their -- when the Dutch police stuck their head in there and saying, "What is this?"</span> <span id="s1271">you know.</span> <span id="s1272">Curfew is on -- you could -- I would have a smile and papers.</span> <span id="s1273">And I shifted a lot of people.</span> <span id="s1274">That way!</span> <span id="s1275">You know, from one hiding place that had gotten dangerous to another one which is new, hopefully better.</span> <span id="s1276">And I did little things like that.</span> <span id="s1277">Also, Monfred would distribute the which was the communist newspaper.</span> <span id="s1278">Marga was distributing the which was the regular -- the -- the other newspaper.</span> <span id="s1279">And I would be sent carrying bags of those with lettuce and tomatoes and carrots on top.</span> <span id="s1280">And, again, you know I would be -- I would be told, "You bring this to a certain little portal with and just somebody will come and get it.”</span> <span id="s1281">I didn't know who was going to get it.</span> <span id="s1282">I didn't know when they were there.</span> <span id="s1283">If they were there before me or after me.</span> <span id="s1284">I -- you know, I would go.</span> <span id="s1285">I would watch the portal and if I saw somebody go into a specific corner of it, and not ring the bell or -- or, you know, whatever it was that I thought these were the right people, I would walk up with the bag.</span> <span id="s1286">And if they took it, they were the right people.</span> <span id="s1287">If they didn't, I would walk on.</span> <span id="s1288">Little things like that.</span> <span id="s1289">I also Marga's fiance -- we were constantly short of money of course.</span> <span id="s1290">That was a big problem.</span> <span id="s1291">And Monfred in his letter to me just now said that some money we had because some more jewelry of my -- they had a lot of jewelry that was being sold and I had little pieces left that I could sell.</span> <span id="s1292">It was sold to Dutch people who, you know, wanted it as an investment.</span> <span id="s1293">And the money was used for us to eat and -- and live, rent and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s1294">Later on Leo Vial would transport Dutch workers to France.</span> <span id="s1295">We tried to mix-up people, because the Germans were taking all the young people to Germany to work in those factories, not particularly in concentration camps, just in factories while their own people went to the various fronts.</span> <span id="s1296">And we would mix-up these.</span> <span id="s1297">We would have Frenchmen in Holland, and Dutchman -- and when the Germans would find them, the French would say, "We were sent here to work in -- in Holland and for the Dutch -- for the German industry," And the Dutchman in France would say, "But we were shipped here by the Germans to work for the for the French industry.”</span> <span id="s1298">I mean it was a total mix-up.</span> <span id="s1299">Some people also would be sent, if we were lucky, would be sent through France and Spain into Portugal and would then join the Dutch Free Forces on the British 8th Brigade in England if one would be able to get there.</span> <span id="s1300">But our Leo only took them to France.</span> <span id="s1301">Well, on his way home he would often bring suitcases full of lipsticks and , you know, all these wonderful French things that you couldn't get.</span> <span id="s1302">And perfumes and other things that the French and that Holland didn't have.</span> <span id="s1303">And then me, I would be sent to sell them.</span> <span id="s1304">And I would go to -- he even wrote the addresses down where I would go to sell them downtown in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s1305">And people would buy them like crazy.</span> <span id="s1306">I mean I didn't -- I sold them wholesale.</span> <span id="s1307">I sold the whole suitcase full all at once, and we would eat.</span> <span id="s1308">And one time I came home and I saw the Dutch police all over the place, watching -- in our house.</span> <span id="s1309">Well, I knew enough, Thank God, not to go home.</span> <span id="s1310">So I stood on the corner watching til they came back out and -- and they had made a mistake.</span> <span id="s1311">Of course, they didn't.</span> <span id="s1312">I don't know what Monfred did, but he got rid of them.</span> <span id="s1313">And -- I mean there -- there were always -- always these horrible moments, you know, where you think, "Now, this is it.</span> <span id="s1314">This is it.”</span> <span id="s1315">And also one time I drove -- rode my bike up a one-way street the wrong way.</span> <span id="s1316">I..</span> <span id="s1317">I was really confused.</span> <span id="s1318">It was downtown and there was a lot of traffic.</span> <span id="s1319">And I got stopped.</span> <span id="s1320">And, of course, they looked at my papers.</span> <span id="s1321">By that time, I had much better papers.</span> <span id="s1322">Now, with the dancing, that ended because somebody told Evan that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1323">Now she was supposedly pro-Hitler and pro this and pro that, but she knew that I was Jewish and she never did anything about it.</span> <span id="s1324">Never!</span> <span id="s1325">She called -- did call me in and she said, "It would be better if you had a little more training before you go on further trips.”</span> <span id="s1326">She put that very well.</span> <span id="s1327">She never said, you know, "I put you into this company because you were so good and what the Hell have you done to me?"</span> <span id="s1328">She said exactly what I told you.</span> <span id="s1329">She said, "A little more training would be good for you, so just go to school.”</span> <span id="s1330">So that she -- you know, wouldn't be endangered and I would be must less endangered.</span> <span id="s1331">And the strange thing was that she had been told by people who were actually watching out for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">Was a different group of people.</span> <span id="s1333">It was Maria Austria and her friend, , who are all in the book who thought it was much too dangerous for me to do what I did, and who didn't want me to do it.</span> <span id="s1334">And I wouldn't listen.</span> <span id="s1335">And so that's how they did it.</span> <span id="s1336">They went and they told Yvonne Geoorgi about that.</span> <span id="s1337">So I have -- I have a picture of Yvonne Geeorgi which she had signed for me and -- and, you know, and I gave her her book and we -- we left.</span> <span id="s1338">I never did believe that was really a fascist.</span> <span id="s1339">She was a artist who -- who maybe didn't have as much character as one was supposed to have, but she was a German and she was -- I don't know.</span> <span id="s1340">I -- who's going to throw the first stone.</span> <span id="s1341">She didn't kill me.</span> <span id="s1342">She was good to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">Really.</span> <span id="s1344">And after the war, when all the artists marched -- you know in the -- in the -- what's the big festival after we were liberated -- liberated?</span> <span id="s1345">I was not allowed to march because I had worked for the German, you know, in the ballet, during -- Nobody ever said -- nobody ever said: But she did it because of the papers.</span> <span id="s1346">The underground didn't say anything.</span> <span id="s1347">Monfred didn't say anything.</span> <span id="s1348">Nobody -- I mean, Monfred probably didn't think it was very important.</span> <span id="s1349">I thought it was terrible!</span> <span id="s1350">I should have been able to march with the others and, anyway, this is after war stuff.</span> <span id="s1351">That's German -- Dutch bureaucracy kicked in and -- and everything was -- was, you know, back to the way they thought life should be run.</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1353">We need to pause here and change tapes.</span> <span id="s1354">End of Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1357">Now we go.</span> <span id="s1358">You were going to tell us a little more about your underground activities, particularly in smuggling packages?</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">A: I didn't smuggle.</span> <span id="s1360">I sent them by mail.</span> <span id="s1361">The Germans would let you send packages to people in Westerborg, and I managed during the nine months that my parents were there -- I managed to send a lot of packages.</span> <span id="s1362">And I was always collecting things, you know, as I went along.</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">And, of course, we had ration coupons so it was hard, and I always got letters back.</span> <span id="s1364">Actually, we had mail from there.</span> <span id="s1365">Regular mail -- .</span> <span id="s1366">regular mail from my parents.</span> <span id="s1367">And the mail I guess was read, but it was sent on.</span> <span id="s1368">And they received everything I sent.</span> <span id="s1369">Nothing was dis -- had disappeared.</span> <span id="s1370">I also want to say that, you know, when they were taken away that I never knew that they were in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1371">I didn't know where they had gone.</span> <span id="s1372">I heard they had been sent on, and that was it.</span> <span id="s1373">And it now appears that it was in January of ‘44.</span> <span id="s1374">And it was -- it was a terrible shock.</span> <span id="s1375">It was just really incredible shock.</span> <span id="s1376">And I also want to say that I think I survived because I was 17 or you know, by that time 19.</span> <span id="s1377">It's the sort and it was exciting, you know, this living alone and not knowing -- everyday it was something else, and not knowing what was going to happen.</span> <span id="s1378">The drudgery, you know, of trying to get food and of survival and -- Okay.</span> <span id="s1379">At 19 they felt I was getting old enough to do some other things also.</span> <span id="s1380">You know, since I couldn't be in the ballet anymore, I had to be good for something.</span> <span id="s1381">And besides standing in line for food, which was hard in the winter in the rain and in the cold I can tell you.</span> <span id="s1382">We took care of a lot of other people who were underground who could not be out.</span> <span id="s1383">I mean from the point of view of -- I didn't particularly see these people, but I had to supply food, you know, get food for them.</span> <span id="s1384">Somebody made me or helped me -- I forgot how, but I rented an apartment.</span> <span id="s1385">Was the same apartment with the same street, the 91, you know, where we had been before.</span> <span id="s1386">This was now an 86.</span> <span id="s1387">was on the second floor of 80 -- number 86 in the Valarastratt.</span> <span id="s1388">We might have just heard that it was coming free, you know, because we were right there in the neighborhood.</span> <span id="s1389">Anyway, it was rented under my name my false name, of course.</span> <span id="s1390">And then a very difficult time started.</span> <span id="s1391">Very difficult!</span> <span id="s1392">First of all, we went into the hunger winter.</span> <span id="s1393">You know the time that the south was liberated, south being Braba -- north Braba, and all those.</span> <span id="s1394">And that only did provinces around were still occupied and was coming up along the Rhine and we were stuck in that area.</span> <span id="s1395">Not only us, but also the Germans.</span> <span id="s1396">They couldn't get out.</span> <span id="s1397">And this was the first time that they also had less food.</span> <span id="s1398">They started to be hungry.</span> <span id="s1399">And we started -- they started to be scared of the underground who had all the weapons -- had so many weapons.</span> <span id="s1400">And they had weapons, but they were mostly old men and kids, you know, and it was just a very, very scary situation.</span> <span id="s1401">And during that time I had the apartment and apartment had big windows.</span> <span id="s1402">And I met the neighbors from across the street, and they were telling me that the people downstairs would go upstairs to our apartment when we were out and steal the food out of the closet.</span> <span id="s1403">Well, that was one thing.</span> <span id="s1404">But we also were hiding people there.</span> <span id="s1405">And that was another thing!</span> <span id="s1406">Right?</span> <span id="s1407">And the -- imagine them running into these people.</span> <span id="s1408">So we had hiding places.</span> <span id="s1409">You know, we had closets -- what used to be closets, was now papered over and there was an entrance via the floor and there was a rug that went up to it.</span> <span id="s1410">And, of course, the people we hid knew how to get into these closets.</span> <span id="s1411">Of course, the Germans weren't stupid either and if something was going in -- on, you know, if they did have a rautsea , if they did have a check into various apartments, they would stick their bayonets into the walls and into the floors and, you know, looking for people.</span> <span id="s1412">And There was one guy which was assigned to our -- to my apartment where I lived with Monfred and with various other people of the group whoever was around at the time.</span> <span id="s1413">And this man was, I think, a Czech -- Czechish communist.</span> <span id="s1414">And he would give lectures in our apartment and we weren't allowed to have more than three or four people, so this very scary, and I started to be very scared.</span> <span id="s1415">And, first of all, I didn't like what he said and I said to Mon, "You know, I do not want this anymore.</span> <span id="s1416">This is my apart -- you know, I hired under my name and I would -- I'm responsible and it's dangerous.</span> <span id="s1417">And these people, they will tell on us.</span> <span id="s1418">And Monfred said, It's nothing to be done.</span> <span id="s1419">We have to have him.”</span> <span id="s1420">He also had to have his wife on weekends.</span> <span id="s1421">So she was hidden somewhere else.</span> <span id="s1422">RIght?</span> <span id="s1423">But on weekends, she came to our place.</span> <span id="s1424">And one day this -- this one woman and I who took care of the apartment were told that the Germans were going to check into place, and in several in the neighborhood.</span> <span id="s1425">So we had to move him.</span> <span id="s1426">We had to move him.</span> <span id="s1427">And we moved him at night some -- to another apartment -- another place.</span> <span id="s1428">And then we had to clean up to see that they didn't see that there had been a man anywhere, because there was supposed to be two women living in this apartment.</span> <span id="s1429">So we started -- we went into his apartment -- into his room and he had left everything.</span> <span id="s1430">Cigars!</span> <span id="s1431">First of all, how did he have cigars?</span> <span id="s1432">Nobody had cigars.</span> <span id="s1433">Apples!</span> <span id="s1434">Foods!</span> <span id="s1435">Cheese!</span> <span id="s1436">We didn't give it to him.</span> <span id="s1437">How did he get it?</span> <span id="s1438">And when -- finally when all this was over, you know, the Germans never did come to visit -- to us to check up, but when it was all over, I said to my friend, "I do not want this guy.”</span> <span id="s1439">It's terrible.</span> <span id="s1440">I mean he was a hoarder, somebody who hoarded things.</span> <span id="s1441">We were supposed to share everything, you know.</span> <span id="s1442">This was very important.</span> <span id="s1443">And he was a communist.</span> <span id="s1444">He should know how to share.</span> <span id="s1445">Anyway, he -- I told Monfred, "he has to go.”</span> <span id="s1446">And Monfred got very, very angry.</span> <span id="s1447">They beat up on me because they were so angry that I would, you know, and I -- and they said, "Well, what can you do to us.</span> <span id="s1448">You can't do anything anything to us.”</span> <span id="s1449">I said -- and I stupid -- my old stupid, I said, "Yes, I can go to the police.”</span> <span id="s1450">Can you believe it?</span> <span id="s1451">I was just impossibly stupid.</span> <span id="s1452">I mean I was so desperate.</span> <span id="s1453">You know I thought we're all going to be caught.</span> <span id="s1454">You know, we're all -- and -- and I'll never forget that guy.</span> <span id="s1455">It was awful, and his red headed wife.</span> <span id="s1456">Impossible!</span> <span id="s1457">So anyway, those are -- were some of the adventures, you know, during the -- and, of course, the Americans -- New Year's Eve -- American soldiers, who had to be hidden, you know, from -- they would be shot down by the Germans over -- the -- the -- the planes would come flying.</span> <span id="s1458">They were full of bombs, you know.</span> <span id="s1459">And on the way home, he might have a bomb left.</span> <span id="s1460">And they would drop a bomb.</span> <span id="s1461">They would just drop the bomb -- the -- the Americans.</span> <span id="s1462">So sometimes the Germans got one of those planes, and we got somebody to hide -- English, American, whatever.</span> <span id="s1463">New Year's Eve, the American went on the roof and shot off his gun.</span> <span id="s1464">I mean I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s1465">Ohhhh!</span> <span id="s1466">So -- uh -- then the -- the hunger got so great that the -- and we got to the end -- toward the end, you know, the Germans knew -- toward the end.</span> <span id="s1467">And they let the Red Cross drop food in Amsterdam -- in and around Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s1468">And the Red Cross -- we had flat roofs.</span> <span id="s1469">You know, the roofs in Amsterdam behind the decorations are flat.</span> <span id="s1470">So they dropped cases of food on the roofs or in the parks or in open space, and the Germans were so scared by that time they didn't dare to pick them up.</span> <span id="s1471">And the underground and -- I -- the food was distributed evenly, you know.</span> <span id="s1472">You had to give whatever -- if you found one on your roof, you know, you better take it.</span> <span id="s1473">And we were all starving.</span> <span id="s1474">We were really -- the bread was -- had gone sour.</span> <span id="s1475">We ate everything, you know, that -- that they dropped.</span> <span id="s1476">And then the -- we heard that the Canadians were coming to liberate us.</span> <span id="s1477">I haven't told you about Akmier.</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">Q: I'd like you to go back and tell us about Akmier.</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1480">Well, toward the end of the war, I kept hearing about a man man Almier who was a German, and who did fantastic things for the underground, the Dutch underground.</span> <span id="s1481">And Monfred said one day that Akmier's place of hiding was not very good and Akmier should, perhaps, if it was alright -- it was my apartment -- right?</span> <span id="s1482">-- Akmier should come to us.</span> <span id="s1483">Well, Akmier came to visit -- to see if that was alright.</span> <span id="s1484">Well we also arranged a girl for him to come that he might like.</span> <span id="s1485">We wanted him to come because it was dangerous for him.</span> <span id="s1486">We didn't want him to get into trouble.</span> <span id="s1487">Now it turned out that -- that he was -- he really had to stay where he was he felt for a little while.</span> <span id="s1488">And the underground came to him to Monfred and said you have to get him out of there because if he is -- when we get liberated, if he is where he is now, we might have to send him back to Germany or anyway he'll be in deep trouble.</span> <span id="s1489">And so they sent me to get him.</span> <span id="s1490">And I went over there I said you have to come and stay us and you have to come.</span> <span id="s1491">You have to come.</span> <span id="s1492">So Akmier came.</span> <span id="s1493">And then I heard his whole story.</span> <span id="s1494">He -- he was a German -- was involved in a Munich story where the six people were hanged.</span> <span id="s1495">Six students -- they turned over a whole suitcase full of pamphlets on -- on an assembly in -- of Munich University full of anti-Hitler propaganda.</span> <span id="s1496">And in one -- of course, they all got caught.</span> <span id="s1497">I mean it was very early on and nobody knew what to do.</span> <span id="s1498">So -- so in one of their books was his name?</span> <span id="s1499">-- in one of his -- the notebooks, address books was his name, and somehow they managed to get him out of Germany.</span> <span id="s1500">He had just finished his medical studies and he was sent to Villemina Hot Towers in Amsterdam, which is a mental institution and hospital in Amsterdam, and he was supposed to study further psychiatry.</span> <span id="s1501">He wanted to go into psychiatry.</span> <span id="s1502">So he studied there and worked there, and he started working with the underground.</span> <span id="s1503">And he -- he's the one -- one of the people who supplied us with all the serums -- of in.</span> <span id="s1504">.</span> <span id="s1505">inoculations, of all the diseases you caught during the war.</span> <span id="s1506">He got us a piece of soap once in awhile.</span> <span id="s1507">He he helped people.</span> <span id="s1508">He moved people from one place to -- he did a whole lot probably that I don't even know about.</span> <span id="s1509">And then the Germans shifted him to France because there were big battles going on in France, and they needed psychiatrists -- some people to help.</span> <span id="s1510">And in France and once -- once he got there, the situation was so disastrous that he was supposed to tell the soldiers it was worthwhile fighting for Germany.</span> <span id="s1511">It was worthwhile fighting.</span> <span id="s1512">And he saw -- he couldn't do that It was idiotic.</span> <span id="s1513">It was ridiculous to fight.</span> <span id="s1514">And one of the lucky things, then -- more or less, lucky -- was terrible for him -- was that they needed surgeons worse than they needed psychiatrists in the end you know.</span> <span id="s1515">And he was made to work sewing up these left over pieces of flesh and he absolutely lost his mind.</span> <span id="s1516">He just couldn't.</span> <span id="s1517">That was not his nature.</span> <span id="s1518">He couldn't stand -- stand it.</span> <span id="s1519">And so toward V-J day, he had a little Fiat -- little thing, you know, that they had the one -- for one person like bug, they used to call little bug, and he got in it and he -- he rode.</span> <span id="s1520">He got to Belgium and there were Germans there and they painted big white zeros, circles on -- on all the cars that went through.</span> <span id="s1521">So Akmier said to himself that doesn't look too good, you know, why should I have a mark like that on my car.</span> <span id="s1522">And he went to the next town and he washed off the zero -- the -- the -- and he drove on and he heard shooting and he saw a whole lot of cars with big white zeros and there were men and women standing up against the cars being shot, one after the other.</span> <span id="s1523">Deserters.</span> <span id="s1524">Shooting the deserters!</span> <span id="s1525">He didn't have a zero on his car, and he made to Holland.</span> <span id="s1526">And in Holland, he called the underground and the underground -- the car had broken down so he had to walk a little bit.</span> <span id="s1527">And in Holland the -- the underground brought him a suit, took his and buried it -- his uniform and buried it, and took him to Amsterdam and hid him.</span> <span id="s1528">And Akmier did a little bit of work, but not too much then because he could -- what could he do, you know.</span> <span id="s1529">He was, himself, endangered.</span> <span id="s1530">And -- and then after the wa, Akmier stayed in Holland.</span> <span id="s1531">He got this -- you know, the Queen said he was a guy and he could stay -- a good German, and he was -- he was really very marvelous.</span> <span id="s1532">But he had a lot of damage done to his physic during the war, and he never, you know, he just -- he was a psychiatrist and just -- just by himself you know.</span> <span id="s1533">He didn't -- he worked as a psychiatrist, but not -- he doesn't share.</span> <span id="s1534">He doesn't -- I often I always asked him, you know, "Don't you share with others?</span> <span id="s1535">Don't you discuss your cases with others, don't you?"</span> <span id="s1536">“Uh- huh.”</span> <span id="s1537">Nothing.</span> <span id="s1538">Nothing.</span> <span id="s1539">Just sit.</span> <span id="s1540">And</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">Q: You and Akmier became involved.</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">A: We became very involved, but in the end I decided to come to the States anyway.</span> <span id="s1543">No, I -- I wanted children and Akmier did not want children.</span> <span id="s1544">He said, "This is not a world" -- this is one of the things that was done to him.</span> <span id="s1545">I mean, what happened to him.</span> <span id="s1546">He couldn't get passed it, shall we say.</span> <span id="s1547">He said this is not a world for -- for any children.</span> <span id="s1548">And he ended up marrying a woman who already had a child and couldn't have anymore.</span> <span id="s1549">I mean he really looked for somebody like that and he found somebody who was divorced and had the kind of blood disease that she couldn't have any more children then.</span> <span id="s1550">He -- he -- it was terrible.</span> <span id="s1551">It really was so sad.</span> <span id="s1552">And he -- he had such talent.</span> <span id="s1553">You know, he played the violin, and he was very well educated.</span> <span id="s1554">His father was an incredible person.</span> <span id="s1555">His father -- there were three sons.</span> <span id="s1556">Now let me just say that because you have to hear something good about Germans.</span> <span id="s1557">His father was the headmaster of a school and when this all came about and Hitler came up -- his father called his three sons and he said, "There's only one God.”</span> <span id="s1558">They were all Catholic.</span> <span id="s1559">"There's only one God and he is not on this earth.</span> <span id="s1560">And there is only one law, and it's God's law.”</span> <span id="s1561">That's what his father said.</span> <span id="s1562">And all the boys were terrific.</span> <span id="s1563">I mean two of them did go to the front, but they all survived.</span> <span id="s1564">But I mean there are people like that.</span> <span id="s1565">And he lost his job.</span> <span id="s1566">The father was thrown out.</span> <span id="s1567">Right?</span> <span id="s1568">But they needed teachers so bad, he ended up teaching, just plain old teaching then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">Q: Come back to you.</span> <span id="s1570">The war's end is approaching.</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">A: The war's ending.</span> <span id="s1572">The war's ending, and people are showing up.</span> <span id="s1573">People come popping out of the woodwork.</span> <span id="s1574">My cousin, Ava comes back.</span> <span id="s1575">She says, "Here I am.”</span> <span id="s1576">And she told me they were all -- my cousins -- you know, I started learning who was alive and who was dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1577">Q: Tell us -- tell us about the day of liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">A: Well, you know that was a day -- we knew -- there was a terrible thing that happened at the last.</span> <span id="s1579">You might have already have heard about that where the underground had been able to absolutely -- and was not able to do anything because it -- you know -- it -- and they were so frustrated.</span> <span id="s1580">I mean they did do things like shoot a soldier -- shoot -- shoot somebody, you know, or -- or blow up some trains.</span> <span id="s1581">I -- I guess they did some things like that, you know.</span> <span id="s1582">But they had all these weapons.</span> <span id="s1583">And they hadn't been able to get their hands on the Germans, and they really wanted that.</span> <span id="s1584">And in Amsterdam, you know, we knew the -- the Canadians were coming and -- and everybody went downtown to the Dom, which is the big place in front of the town.</span> <span id="s1585">And on the Dam also was the German officer's Club, right -- I mean the Palace of the Queen is, shall we say, to the north and officer's club just a little street apart, maybe 10 feet, 12 feet.</span> <span id="s1586">There was the German Officers Club.</span> <span id="s1587">And who was in this club?</span> <span id="s1588">Old guys and boys of 15!</span> <span id="s1589">I mean really the Germans had nobody left that, so the -- some how somebody had a big shotgun in -- in the Palace -- the underground had a big shotgun and shot into the club.</span> <span id="s1590">And, of course, the Germans then had to fight and I think since there were so many people standing right there in the Dom, I think 147 people died -- and -- and I -- many Germans died.</span> <span id="s1591">I mean it was totally useless.</span> <span id="s1592">It was one of those things that happened in total confusion and fear on both sides, fear and loathing on both sides, and just a horrible, stupid, awful thing.</span> <span id="s1593">Well, during that period we were getting sort of ready.</span> <span id="s1594">You knew you could already go on the streets.</span> <span id="s1595">You knew you didn't have to be as afraid.</span> <span id="s1596">And they were coming.</span> <span id="s1597">And they did come.</span> <span id="s1598">They came.</span> <span id="s1599">And I remember looking at the trucks coming and full of these healthy pink and blond and blue and black-eyed guys.</span> <span id="s1600">I -- I thought our -- our guys were great looking, you know.</span> <span id="s1601">I'd never seen so much flesh.</span> <span id="s1602">I mean it was incredible.</span> <span id="s1603">And, of course, we went out there and screamed.</span> <span id="s1604">We just screamed.</span> <span id="s1605">And all my dance buddies, you know, my ballet -- my friends, they all -- I heard all of them -- they all had boyfriends.</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">They all got boyfriends, and this and that.</span> <span id="s1607">I, of course, had a friend and I did not.</span> <span id="s1608">I had always been scared to death of any kind of soldiers, so I never had anything to do with any kind of soldier.</span> <span id="s1609">Anyway, gun carrying, uniformed person.</span> <span id="s1610">It was awful.</span> <span id="s1611">It was -- I mean it was wonderful.</span> <span id="s1612">It was heavenly, and it was scary.</span> <span id="s1613">Very, very scary!</span> <span id="s1614">Because I didn't really know where I belonged then, you know.</span> <span id="s1615">I knew I had -- I had immediately withdrawn because I got into the ballet.</span> <span id="s1616">The ballet 1945 was started right then.</span> <span id="s1617">It had already been started for a whole month before that, and we had rehearsed to get ready for -- for the ballet.</span> <span id="s1618">But then it really started and I started to work nearly immediately after the war was over in the Ballet 1945.</span> <span id="s1619">Then later we came to the States, Ballet Company, grew out of that.</span> <span id="s1620">And then they had a festival, a wonderful festival.</span> <span id="s1621">And, of course, there were no lights.</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">There was not yet any electricity.</span> <span id="s1623">By that time we had to go down and get water to the third floor in buckets between three and five, you get -- got assigned periods where you get water in buckets and we were pretty starved.</span> <span id="s1624">I mean during that we ate from the fox kitchen.</span> <span id="s1625">We ate bulbs flower bulbs, soup made out of flower bulbs and we ate -- well, whatever the soup kitchen came up with, that's what we ate.</span> <span id="s1626">You know, you had three little pots and one of you had to go and get it.</span> <span id="s1627">And the amazing thing was that the formerly poor people complained much more than the people who formerly had money.</span> <span id="s1628">It was very, very funny.</span> <span id="s1629">And the articles in the paper were a riot.</span> <span id="s1630">But hunger was not funny.</span> <span id="s1631">And we would go up and get up in the morning and have -- have a ship's cracker, you know, one of these hard tack things, and we haven't -- hadn't had any butter or fat for so long that we were freezing to death.</span> <span id="s1632">I was always cold.</span> <span id="s1633">I was -- and this is still one of my greatest fear.</span> <span id="s1634">I can stand hunger better than cold.</span> <span id="s1635">It was terribly cold.</span> <span id="s1636">We would take -- there was six of us or seven of us in the apartment -- we would go all in one bed and put everybody's blankets and mattresses on top of us and we still were cold, you know.</span> <span id="s1637">And eat a hard tack before getting up, and then only cold water to wash with.</span> <span id="s1638">And, of course, after -- right after -- oh, we had no coal to heat -- heat the stove, which by the way was the only thing to cook on.</span> <span id="s1639">Remember gas wasn't there anymore.</span> <span id="s1640">So we got -- Monfred had a big he got a lot of peach from outside and -- and we brought -- we had a whole room, small room, storage room full of peat.</span> <span id="s1641">And we used the peat to -- to cook on the stove which was just a little heating, which also heated the room.</span></p> <p><span id="s1642">And that peat was full of fleas and we had a flea plague on top of the cold and the hunger.</span> <span id="s1643">And one night I caught 84 fleas.</span> <span id="s1644">I killed 84 fleas.</span> <span id="s1645">I mean we were covered, and actually we didn't get rid of it til the Americans gave us some DDT, which was brand new then.</span> <span id="s1646">I mean I don't think there even.</span> <span id="s1647">I mean it was just in total disaster.</span> <span id="s1648">We were hungry, cold, and full of fleas by the end of the war.</span> <span id="s1649">It was outrageous.</span> <span id="s1650">And then there was this wonderful festival where they made fires everywhere and they had -- I don't know where they got lights, but at night we had lights and boats were laid across the canals and you could walk from one side from one to the other just over -- over the boat.</span> <span id="s1651">I was in love.</span> <span id="s1652">And it was wonderful.</span> <span id="s1653">It was the most wonderful -- wonderful day in my -- I can ever remember.</span> <span id="s1654">And I didn't think -- I didn't let myself think about my parents and my -- for that one day.</span> <span id="s1655">And then afterwards, I said, "Now what?</span> <span id="s1656">Now what?"</span> <span id="s1657">And then we started hearing that -- oh, they are lists.</span> <span id="s1658">They are lists of people who were coming back, and your mother is on one of the lists.</span> <span id="s1659">Well, Monfred said to me then, "Don't believe it.”</span> <span id="s1660">And I -- I already hated him with a passion.</span></p> <p><span id="s1661">Right?</span> <span id="s1662">Because he had done all these horrible things.</span> <span id="s1663">And he said, "Don't believe it.”</span> <span id="s1664">And I said, "I'm going to believe it.”</span> <span id="s1665">We then knew -- we knew about concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1666">In ‘45.</span> <span id="s1667">So I started going to the train stations.</span> <span id="s1668">And, of course, I stood there.</span> <span id="s1669">When I had the time, I stood there and I stood there and I stood there.</span> <span id="s1670">I asked -- and when I see these films, you know, they are films made by the French.</span> <span id="s1671">They were wonderful French films, but and -- and they're these people going to -- other people coming out of trains, you know, and they have their shaved and they looked awful and there are these people coming back from camps and you ask -- that's how it was -- and you asked, did you know so and so?</span> <span id="s1672">Did you know so and son?</span> <span id="s1673">No.</span> <span id="s1674">No.</span> <span id="s1675">No.</span> <span id="s1676">Now I think that one of those people was somebody took my mother's name to get back to Holland.</span> <span id="s1677">I'm sure of it.</span> <span id="s1678">And recently somebody showed up with my sister's name.</span> <span id="s1679">And, of course, when I started looking, she was gone.</span> <span id="s1680">I mean there was nobody to find.</span> <span id="s1681">And it's the same sort of thing and then I started waving goodbye to people.</span> <span id="s1682">I had girlfriends who met Americans and who married them.</span> <span id="s1683">And I started seeing people who were not good and women who were not good in the war.</span> <span id="s1684">And I was waving goodbye to them because they were marrying American soldiers.</span> <span id="s1685">What do the American soldiers know?</span> <span id="s1686">They know nothing!</span> <span id="s1687">And if they had known, what would it have mattered?</span> <span id="s1688">They were in love.</span> <span id="s1689">You know, such is human nature.</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">Q: We need to move.</span> <span id="s1691">Can you tell me just tell me what, very briefly, what you did now and -- .</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">A: Well, after the war, of course, I -- I worked for two years in the Ballet.</span> <span id="s1693">I danced.</span> <span id="s1694">That's how I make money.</span> <span id="s1695">And I started to realize that every time I got a job, they had to ask for a work permit because I was not a Dutch citizen.</span> <span id="s1696">And it was a lot of work for them and bless them, they did it.</span> <span id="s1697">I mean I did not -- I thought I wouldn't have done it.</span> <span id="s1698">I can get another girl, you know.</span> <span id="s1699">But I always had a job.</span> <span id="s1700">And Akmier, of course, was working by that time, and so we managed.</span> <span id="s1701">But when I decided -- a friend of my family Lotta Kalinaski, also from Berlin who was -- is quite a well known psychiatrist here in the States I think -- .</span> <span id="s1702">I went for shock treatments and things.</span> <span id="s1703">And Lotta was looking for my parents.</span> <span id="s1704">I had gone to my older apartment -- our -- our apartment where I lived with my family and had told the woman there where I was living and to please forward any mail that she would get and to please let me look in the hiding places that we had around the house.</span> <span id="s1705">And, of course, she'd found the hiding places.</span> <span id="s1706">There was nothing there.</span> <span id="s1707">And then the woman below us, who was a fascist during the war, she said, "I saw you got on -- you know, it was dangerous for her -- dangerous period for her.</span> <span id="s1708">She might have been shipped to Germany or killed by the where all the Dutch wanted to take revenge on their people -- and she said, "I didn't give you away when you ran away.</span> <span id="s1709">You helped me.”</span> <span id="s1710">And I said, "You were helped enough.”</span> <span id="s1711">Because she had a lot of our stuff, and I didn't get anything back.</span> <span id="s1712">So I -- I said, "I won't give you away, just like you didn't give me away.”</span> <span id="s1713">And that was all I ever did for her.</span> <span id="s1714">I didn't give her away.</span> <span id="s1715">I said, "If they catch on to you, that's not my fault.</span> <span id="s1716">I don't -- you know, it's your.”</span> <span id="s1717">Anyway, I got a -- I got a lot of mail from all over the world, from Australia, from Canada, from America, from -- all -- all over the world where people had managed to escape to.</span> <span id="s1718">And one of the letters I got was from the Kanaski's and they asked me to come to the States.</span> <span id="s1719">At the time I was in the Ballet and I was with Akmier and I thought Akmier would get over the fact that he didn't want to have children, which I knew I had to have children.</span> <span id="s1720">So I said to Kanaski, let's wait.</span> <span id="s1721">Let's wait.</span> <span id="s1722">He said, "I'll give you an affidavit and you come.”</span> <span id="s1723">And he kept coming by because he -- he went to Berlin to lecture.</span> <span id="s1724">He helped set up the free university of Berlin as psychiatry -- department of psychiatry there, and giving lectures.</span> <span id="s1725">So he came every year two or three times and he said, "Now you must come.”</span> <span id="s1726">And made -- he sent me the affidavit and made me sign it, and by that time I thought it would be better and that's how I came to the States.</span> <span id="s1727">He was very -- they were very good to me -- very good to me.</span> <span id="s1728">And I also have other family here.</span> <span id="s1729">They were also good to me.</span> <span id="s1730">So -- and I worked as a ballet -- as a dancer.</span> <span id="s1731">And that's it!</span> <span id="s1732">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">Q: I want to thank you.</span> <span id="s1734">Very much!</span></p> <p><span id="s1735">A: Thank you.</span> <span id="s1736">You're welcome.</span> <span id="s1737">You don't want to know I have four children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1738">Q: Bonnie, turn it back on so the lady can tell us okay, she has four children.</span> <span id="s1739">Can you turn it back on for a minute please?</span></p> <p><span id="s1740">A: No.</span> <span id="s1741">That's alright.</span></p> <p><span id="s1742">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1743">Tell us about your children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1744">A: I just wanted to say that -- you know, you hear all these horrible, horrible stories that I made it through and I have a nice husband and four children , who are very, very happy.</span> <span id="s1745">And my husband's name is Mike Rodbell.</span> <span id="s1746">And we live in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, and everything's fine.</span> <span id="s1747">I survived.</span> <span id="s1748">Yal</span></p>
