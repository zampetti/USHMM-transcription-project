Ruth Goodman I was born in 1954 in Kiev, which is the capitol of the Ukraine.</span> <span id="s15">My father and mother were from Kiev too.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">I studied in the Kiev special English school.</span> <span id="s17">We studied English, as a foreign language, from the first grade.</span> <span id="s18">For ten years I studied English - my parents prepared me for America from my early childhood.</span> <span id="s19">--- That was a joke.</span> <span id="s20">They did a lot for me but some of this wasn't too helpful to me.</span> <span id="s21">They wanted to give me a good education.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">When we were young we did not make any decisions, our parents thought for us.</span> <span id="s23">They decided, of course, until we were about twenty.</span> <span id="s24">I respected my parents, I trusted them, and I knew that they tried to do what was best for me.</span> <span id="s25">For Serge, too, this is true.</span> <span id="s26">I have a very good mother-in-law, she is my best friend.</span> <span id="s27">So I think that he did what she suggested.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">The history of my family is the same as almost all Jewish families in Russia.</span> <span id="s29">My mother's cousin left Russia in 1924, after the Revolution.</span> <span id="s30">My mother's mother was not allowed to leave because the door was closed at that time and the family was divided.</span> <span id="s31">A brother and sister were in America and another sister and brother stayed in Russia.</span> <span id="s32">During the years when Stalin was the leader of Communist Party they did not receive any information from each other.</span> <span id="s33">Only in 1978 were my mother's two sisters in Russia and I saw them for the first time in my life.</span> <span id="s34">I had heard about them but had never seen them.</span> <span id="s35">Now we keep in touch with them.</span> <span id="s36">They are in New York with their families and their children and they are American.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">My father and mother and my brother with his family, are in America for two months.</span> <span id="s38">They are very happy here after a tough time.</span> <span id="s39">Before, in Russia we got all bad news about pogroms, about anti-Semitic groups, Jewish discrimination, and we were very worried about them.</span> <span id="s40">First of all, what was difficult was that we were separated.</span> <span id="s41">It is very hard for all mothers to know that you can't call your daughter every evening, you can't ask her everything about your grandchild.</span> <span id="s42">Nobody knew if we will have a chance to see each other again.</span> <span id="s43">It was very hard when some left and others stayed behind.</span> <span id="s44">We were very afraid, so when they came here we were very happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">As you know, policy in the Soviet Union changes every day so we were very afraid that something might happen and, who knows?</span> <span id="s46">Four years ago Gorbachev opened the gate but he can also close the gate and that's it.</span> <span id="s47">That is what happened ten years ago.</span> <span id="s48">You know a few examples of this, that some people came here and the parents or children did not get to come because Brezhnev closed the door and that was that.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">It is hard to describe our concerns about this because they are now here!</span> <span id="s50">You know, when we were in Italy and we got calls from them that we were supposed to meet them on such and such a day, but what could I do about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">My father used to work as some kind of mechanic in Russia.</span> <span id="s52">He could not get a higher education, he was not allowed to enter the university.</span> <span id="s53">The time after the Second World War was a very hard time for all people, all around the world and especially in Russia.</span> <span id="s54">Both my grandfathers were gone, after the war, they were killed in the fighting.</span> <span id="s55">It was a very hard time for our family.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">The Post-War Period was a difficult time for all Soviet people because during this time all the livestock, factories, etc., had been destroyed.</span> <span id="s57">A lot of people died on the battlefield and probably you heard about Baby Yar.</span> <span id="s58">All Jewish people in Kiev were killed and it was a major tragedy.</span> <span id="s59">Fortunately, all of my parents and grandmothers had relocated from Kiev and they survived.</span> <span id="s60">After the war, when my mother, my grandmother, returned back to Kiev (my grandfather died during the war, he was killed).</span> <span id="s61">She worked hard to raise her four children.</span> <span id="s62">My mother was seventeen so at that time she worked and at other times she took classes at the Institute because she wanted to be something special.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">When my father and his mother returned from the capitol of Armenia, the apartment where they lived at the beginning of the war was filled with other people and they did not want to allow my grandmother to live in her old apartment.</span> <span id="s64">They had relatives who allowed them to live with them for a while.</span> <span id="s65">These relative's of my father were the neighbors of relatives of my mother and so they met each other.</span> <span id="s66">Later they were married.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">My father took classes and when my brother was born in 1947, just after the War, there was nothing to eat and it very hard time in the life of most Soviet people.</span> <span id="s68">My mother told me that he was born too soon and was very weak.</span> <span id="s69">He could not walk on his own until he was about seven years old.</span> <span id="s70">Because my mother was very weak and the child, of course, was also very weak.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Then, when I was born in 1954, in the Soviet Union, - even now!</span> <span id="s72">- clinics and hospitals were in terrible condition.</span> <span id="s73">Antiseptic conditions are very bad.</span> <span id="s74">You can imagine how it was in 1954, and my Mom got an infection in her blood and she almost died.</span> <span id="s75">She wrote a letter to my Dad about my older brother, his name is Yury, and she asked my grandmother to raise Yury, and my Dad to raise me.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">When I was four months old the doctors allowed us to leave the hospital and to come back home.</span> <span id="s77">When she was at the hospital it was necessary to feed her better, with good food, vegetables.</span> <span id="s78">My father was forced to stop his classes and find a second job, and a third job, and he never had a chance to finish his education.</span> <span id="s79">He needed to work many jobs to be able to get better food for my mother and his children.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Probably in America, children don't have this, but when children have very, very, big head, out of proportion to their body, it is because of lack of fresh air, lack of sun.</span> <span id="s81">This affected me.</span> <span id="s82">Because of lack of nutrition - the Russian word translates to scurvy in your dictionary.</span> <span id="s83">Then, after we were at home, everything became better and better, and I know that doctors suggest to give these little kids, Vitamin D.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">About Baby Yar, our parents and our friends, all Jewish people, and not just Jewish people, know about Baby Yar because it was a tragedy.</span> <span id="s85">There were a lot of Jewish people who were killed during this time and it was a tragedy of Soviet people that the government at that time didn't want to tell people that, in this place, were killed so many Jewish people.</span> <span id="s86">And the rest of the people asked them to build a memorial there for the memory of all generations.</span> <span id="s87">First of all, the government didn't want to do this because of the Jewish people there.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">They put in New Russian that there were no Jewish people there.</span> <span id="s89">They put up a big rock with a sign that says that Jews during the Second World War and a lot of Soviet people and members of the Communist Party were killed.</span> <span id="s90">But this is a special place where a lot of Jewish people were killed.</span> <span id="s91">It is true a lot of other Russians, writers, poets, Ukrainians and a lot of other intelligent people were gathered there and killed.</span> <span id="s92">They read the poems and they told very warm words, it was September 29th, I remember that day.</span> <span id="s93">The Government did not allow it as a memorial.</span> <span id="s94">The police did not allow people to go there and place flowers.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">My grandmother with my Dad, and my second grandma with her children were evacuated.</span> <span id="s96">A lot of people were evacuated at that time.</span> <span id="s97">I think that they saw that most of their friends were evacuated and I think they did a very smart thing and left too, to save their children.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">My mother was the eldest one in the family.</span> <span id="s99">She had two sisters and one brother.</span> <span id="s100">The brother now has his family in Israel and the sister is still in Russia.</span> <span id="s101">My mother, thank God, did get a higher education and she worked as a bookkeeper and accountant.</span> <span id="s102">They tried to give their kids a good education like most Jewish parents want for their children, the best they can.</span> <span id="s103">We studied English and then Music and Sportcraft and we grew up like all Soviet children but, as I remember from my early childhood I had some problems in school and during all my ten years at school.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">I remember exactly that in my school and my class I had many classmates who abused me - they called me 'Kike.'</span> <span id="s105">You can believe that when I was a small girl I didn't know what that meant so I asked my mother.</span> <span id="s106">I said I didn't want to be a 'kike.'</span> <span id="s107">And my mother explained that 'Kike' is a very dirty word and it means Jew.</span> <span id="s108">She said, "I am a Jew and your grandmother is a Jew and your father is a Jew.</span> <span id="s109">Are we dirt?"</span> <span id="s110">So, I knew they were good people and that it wasn't so bad to be a Jew and that those people who called me 'Kike' were probably stupid and not to mind what they said.</span> <span id="s111">My mother taught me that you are supposed to study hard and do very well, get the highest marks, because you are Jewish.</span> <span id="s112">You are supposed to be ten times greater than your classmates.</span> <span id="s113">This was my first lesson.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">So the next time when they tried to call me these names I could defend myself.</span> <span id="s115">And one boy, I bit him, and when my parents were called forward to the principal I explained everything and it was all right.</span> <span id="s116">I knew that I was a Jew and when anybody tells me ---.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">During the ten years in regular school I got only the 5's, they are the best marks you can get in Russia, like A's here.</span> <span id="s118">So in those ten years I got only 5's.</span> <span id="s119">There is a great award for the graduates, the best students are supposed to have only 5's for all subjects and I had ten examinations after ten classes to get my certificate.</span> <span id="s120">One of these exams was to write an article about Ukrainian literature and some poems, I don't remember exactly.</span> <span id="s121">The teacher of Ukrainian Literature gave me only a 4, so I did not have any chance for this award.</span> <span id="s122">I was upset and I can't explain my feelings at that time, it was incredible to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">I wanted to go to the University or some prestigious Institute.</span> <span id="s124">My mother hired two tutors and so I had 5's in my school, I was supposed to do my homework, I started in English school, I had a lot of things to study, to learn, to do, and after my school I studied more than my school programs demanded.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">This I did to be able to pass the test to go to the University, but I couldn't go to the University because I am Jewish so - but I passed all tests for the Agriculture Academy.</span> <span id="s126">The main students of this Academy were kids from the country, from the rural areas, and the level of education there was low and, on this level, my knowledge was huge so I passed all these entrance tests and I was admitted to this Academy.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">As I said, most of the other students were from the country and most of them were very strongly anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s128">I had a very hard time there.</span> <span id="s129">At the time I was studying at this Academy there was some office that checked everything, what is good, what is bad and what is wrong.</span> <span id="s130">They checked all the time, I don't know how to explain.</span> <span id="s131">There was one institute in Kiev at that time where Jewish kids would pass exams and because of the way it was set up, it was very difficult to study.</span> <span id="s132">There were probably three or four people for each desk.</span> <span id="s133">Here you pay your money and you can study what you want.</span> <span id="s134">In the Soviet, it is different.</span> <span id="s135">You are supposed to pass tests and when you pass the tests and you got good marks, you can take classes at this Institute.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">(Serge: Because education is free of charge in Russia.</span> <span id="s137">So for people to be admitted to the Institutes they have to pass first round exams.</span> <span id="s138">A lot of them don't know the subjects too well so a lot of people try.</span> <span id="s139">All the Jewish people are never admitted to the Institutes because there are a lot of other people who are trying to enter.</span> <span id="s140">At the time Lena is speaking of, a little child could pass these exams and there was a committee from the police who checked for bribes.</span> <span id="s141">Some representatives were at the exams to see how students answered the questions and that they got the correct marks.</span> <span id="s142">There are two written exams, and two oral exams.</span> <span id="s143">They were checking to see if a student could not answer the question and if he still got a high mark, then there is either something wrong with the student or with the teacher.)</span> <span id="s144">In the Soviet Union, they had three kinds of educational programs, a day program, an evening program - for those who work during the day.</span> <span id="s145">If you are a student at the Institute you are supposed to be there every day, five days a week.</span> <span id="s146">If there is a lecture, you are supposed to be there.</span> <span id="s147">The third kind, you are supposed to study by yourself with books, with literature and do some work and send assignments to the teacher and if your work on the assignments is good you are supposed to come to the Institute to take an exam and if your work is good you are supposed to take another subject.</span> <span id="s148">You need not be in the same town as the Institute.</span> <span id="s149">A lot of people in Russia have this sort of higher education but a lot of them do not have knowledge.</span> <span id="s150">They enter the Institute and spend the four or five years but really acquire no knowledge.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">(Serge: A lot of people simply pass the exams and get this certification or diploma and not study.</span> <span id="s152">In Russia you can have a diploma and get paid less than a worker because a worker is the most important class.</span> <span id="s153">Sometimes, if you have a diploma you are paid less, particularly if you are an engineer.</span> <span id="s154">You get paid less than a laborer.</span> <span id="s155">So this higher education in Russia doesn't mean anything financially, but our higher education is very helpful for us here.)</span> <span id="s156">In my primary school, there were a lot of Jewish kids.</span> <span id="s157">So my friends were only other Jews.</span> <span id="s158">Some of the teachers were anti-Semitic and in my early school years I did not understood that this was because I was Jewish and that the teacher might be an anti-Semite or not.</span> <span id="s159">I could not understand what happened to me or what was wrong with me.</span> <span id="s160">I asked my mother, "Mom, what is wrong with me, why don't they like me?"</span> <span id="s161">Because we were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">I knew I was Jewish because my grandmother spoke Yiddish and my father and mother understood it and they spoke - not very good - but they spoke Yiddish.</span> <span id="s163">When they wanted the kids to not understand - they spoke Yiddish.</span> <span id="s164">There was a time when I saw that to be Jewish was a shame, because when my grandmother began to speak Yiddish on the street, my mother stopped her.</span> <span id="s165">My mother was afraid.</span> <span id="s166">She was afraid for her, she didn't want her to be abused.</span> <span id="s167">If you are Jewish, some people don't like you, they can call you 'Kike' and you are supposed to swallow this.</span> <span id="s168">Not to answer.</span> <span id="s169">It is not very pretty to hear this kind of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">My mother grew up in a religious household.</span> <span id="s171">My mother's grandfather was a very religious man and in a very small shtetl he was the man who took care of the matzo and sold this matzo to people.</span> <span id="s172">It was a family legend that he was very religious and he could not refuse matzo to anyone who needed it on Pesach.</span> <span id="s173">He would sell what he could and then he left matzo for his family.</span> <span id="s174">My great-grandmother (I was named after her, she was Leah and I am Lena) and my great-grandmother would say, so-and-so needs matzo and cannot afford to buy it, and my great-grandfather would say, "Okay, give him a little bit."</span> <span id="s175">Another one and then another one would ask and he could not refuse.</span> <span id="s176">My grandmother noticed that the matzo was the same amount as what they started out to sell.</span> <span id="s177">It was like a miracle!</span> <span id="s178">And when she said, after this, the like was changed, like more and more and more.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">My mother told me about this family story, but we did not keep the Jewish customs in our house.</span> <span id="s180">I know that we have Pesach and we were supposed to eat Matzo.</span> <span id="s181">My mother prepared very delicious dishes and we children liked these dishes, but we did not know anything about why we ate them, or were supposed to eat them.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">When we were students, we decided to go to the synagogue and my husband was there.</span> <span id="s183">While he was there, his mother was got a call and they told her, "If you don't want your son to be dismissed from this Institute, you should tell him that he will not never go there again."</span> <span id="s184">In Russia we celebrated Pesach and Rosh Hashonah and Chanukah, because my mother always gave me Chanukah Gelt.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">(Serge: But we celebrated all these holidays only in our house-) We celebrated with relatives and friends.</span> <span id="s186">You could not talk about these holidays with your friends on the job or at work, because, first of all, they could not understand them.</span> <span id="s187">You are always afraid to tell that you celebrated Jewish holidays.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">(Serge: We did not celebrate too openly even in the home because there were always small children around and if they asked what we were doing, and we told them, they would go out and tell their friends.)</span> <span id="s189">We never told our son that he was Jewish and he did not know about this until we came here.</span> <span id="s190">It is a problem to know the right way to handle this.</span> <span id="s191">Then he told us, when we were in Italy, that now he understands why his teacher in his Kindergarten didn't like him, why she did such and such things to him.</span> <span id="s192">We never allowed him to walk with his friends without any parents or grandparents along.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">I will tell you why we didn't tell him.</span> <span id="s194">My mother used to work when I was 3, 4, 5 years old and I was supposed to go to the Kindergarten and then I was supposed to go to school; to be among the Russian Ukrainian kids.</span> <span id="s195">Ten years ago we were refused by the Russians.</span> <span id="s196">For ten years we hoped that our dream would come true - and we will leave the Soviet Union.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Eugene was able to get into Kindergarten but not for a long time.</span> <span id="s198">Most of the time he spent at home or with our mothers.</span> <span id="s199">He was only in the first grade, at school, for three months before we left.</span> <span id="s200">So it was not necessary to prepare him.</span> <span id="s201">We got a teacher to teach him English; he studied English in Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">I was twenty-one when I finished Agricultural Institute.</span> <span id="s203">Serge and I met shortly after I graduated from this Institute.</span> <span id="s204">I did not know what a Bar Mitzvah was then and I had no way to meet Jewish boys.</span> <span id="s205">In Russia, boys and girls like to go to dancing clubs.</span> <span id="s206">Some of them like to meet and go to the Museums or to each other's apartment where parents were, for the warmth if nothing else.</span> <span id="s207">They would listen to music and watch TV and speak about many different things.</span> <span id="s208">A lot depends on what each person wants to do.</span> <span id="s209">Most of our time we spent playing different games.</span> <span id="s210">We would take one word and we would create from this word another different word.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">We knew each other between three and six months when we were married.</span> <span id="s212">We were married by a judge, not in a religious ceremony.</span> <span id="s213">We signed the papers and that is it.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">I think that we were very lucky, it was eleven years ago, and you know that most young couples had to live with their parents and this is a big problem in Russia.</span> <span id="s215">We did not have a one-bedroom apartment or a two-bedroom apartment.</span> <span id="s216">We had a two room apartment.</span> <span id="s217">We were so happy from the beginning, Serge and me, without any parents, without any suggestions and we built our family by ourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">How we got the apartment was an interesting history.</span> <span id="s219">Go ahead, Serge.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">(Serge: The trouble in Russia is that you can't rent an apartment or buy an apartment.</span> <span id="s221">Everything belongs to the government.</span> <span id="s222">To get an apartment you have to go to some office and --I cannot even explain it so that you can understand it!</span> <span id="s223">You will maybe get put on a list, not only because you want an apartment but how many square feet there should be in this apartment for the number of people.</span> <span id="s224">Is there less square feet per person than there should be in this rate?</span> <span id="s225">Then you cannot be put in this apartment.</span> <span id="s226">For example, you live five persons in an apartment where there is such-and-such square feet.</span> <span id="s227">If you divide this square footage by the number of people, you will have the rate for this apartment.</span> <span id="s228">If your rate is less than the official rate, you can move, or be put into another apartment.</span> <span id="s229">You might have to wait for five, ten or fifteen years to get this different apartment.)</span> <span id="s230">You know what people did?</span> <span id="s231">They decided to have another baby so they could get a larger apartment!</span></p> <p><span id="s232">(Serge: The only way you can get an apartment without the long wait is to exchange with someone else.</span> <span id="s233">So, we did this.</span> <span id="s234">My in-laws, all five of them, had this three-room apartment.</span> <span id="s235">Not three bedrooms, just three rooms, there were only two bedrooms.</span> <span id="s236">And we changed with other people for two different apartments, which was the only way to have separate apartments.)</span> <span id="s237">The other people were all related and they had two separate small apartments and they preferred to live together.</span> <span id="s238">We all met together and made this exchange.</span> <span id="s239">But -- it should be approved by the government.</span> <span id="s240">You have to get any move approved.</span> <span id="s241">We had to give a bribe to get this approval.</span> <span id="s242">It was money.</span> <span id="s243">It is always dangerous to make a bribe, not only for Jewish people, if the wrong person finds out, you can be sent to prison.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">We had to take this risk because it was very important for us to live separate.</span> <span id="s245">We decided to have our own life.</span> <span id="s246">It is almost a common policy in the Soviet Union, bribes here and there.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Russia is a fine place to live for two weeks; Moscow, Kiev, Leningrad - there are very many sight-seeing places.</span> <span id="s248">A good place to visit but not a good place to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">It was incredible at that time In Russia to have your own apartment - separate.</span> <span id="s250">We had our own two very small rooms and we were very happy there.</span> <span id="s251">We were only married three or four months when we decided to leave Russia, but we were refused.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">I was working as a research engineer and Serge was working as a computer programmer in construction - Civil Engineering Institute - he is so smart!</span> <span id="s253">He made all these pictures and I think they are very beautiful.</span> <span id="s254">We left our jobs, -- (Serge: We were dismissed from our jobs.</span> <span id="s255">I was working in the Civil Engineering Institute and I was dismissed from all my classes, everything.</span> <span id="s256">And during half a year we couldn't find any job!)</span> <span id="s257">We sold all our books and our carpet and tape recorder and I worked like a baby sitter and Serge had some students that he helped prepare for their examinations.</span> <span id="s258">Both his students and the children for whom I baby sat were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">(Serge: We couldn't find any jobs, because when we came to a new office and asked for a job, we had some interviews, and everything seemed to be going well because our knowledge was good.</span> <span id="s260">But when we came to another place we were asked, "What did you do before?"</span> <span id="s261">We had to tell where we had worked before and they called to this office so we couldn't find jobs.)</span> <span id="s262">(It is hard to explain why we left the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s263">It is almost impossible for Jews to live in Russia even now when they have the Perestroika, I don't believe in it.</span> <span id="s264">All the Jewish people are living in constant danger.</span> <span id="s265">There is almost nothing to eat, almost nothing to buy in the stores, they are always trying to find somebody who is guilty for his, so the Jews are easy to blame.)</span> <span id="s266">(We wanted to have this little guy here, but we couldn't leave Russia and we had to spend ten more years there.)</span> <span id="s267">When we told our parents ten years ago that we wanted to leave Russia, they were so scared.</span> <span id="s268">They didn't allow us to do this, they didn't want us to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">(Serge: The Jewish people who lived in Russia a long time were frightened of almost everything.</span> <span id="s270">Either they had to do something outstanding or they were very scared.</span> <span id="s271">Because they were always threatened by other people, so when they heard of our decisions they were afraid for us.</span> <span id="s272">We tried to explain to them but they didn't understand us.)</span> <span id="s273">They said: Why have you decided to leave?</span> <span id="s274">You have almost everything, your apartment, your friends don't have such an apartment!</span> <span id="s275">You graduated the Institute, you have a nice job, who knows what the future may be?</span> <span id="s276">A lot of people who left during the war suffered, they had nothing to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Now, Serge's mother and my parents talk, they feel guilty that they didn't allow us to leave.</span> <span id="s278">They gave us a bit of a hard time, our parents were not happy that we wanted to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">After seven or eight months, I found a job with a very low salary and I was very happy when I found this job.</span> <span id="s280">A month or so after me, Serge found a job.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">(Serge: When she found this job they didn't want to take her, but it was a very small position and they needed somebody and they decided that even though she was a Jew, they would hire her.</span> <span id="s282">In Russia, Jews were never allowed any positions in Personnel Departments.)</span> <span id="s283">(So, her brother's wife helped me to find a job in her organization.</span> <span id="s284">She asked for me and I was hired there for a small position.</span> <span id="s285">Of course, all the time they called my previous job and they were told who I am and why I wasn't working so much.</span> <span id="s286">Then we decided to leave the Soviet and we decided--) to have the baby!</span></p> <p><span id="s287">After Eugene was born I stayed at home for three and a half years.</span> <span id="s288">We kept our apartment and Serge kept his students.</span> <span id="s289">In the Soviet Union, the rent is very small and for electricity and gas the charges are very small.</span> <span id="s290">Food took almost all our salary.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">All our Jewish friends applied to leave and they are now all in America.</span> <span id="s292">Some of them left Russia ten years ago.</span> <span id="s293">We were refused then but maybe they applied one month before us and were able to leave.</span> <span id="s294">No explanation was ever given for our refusal.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">(Serge: It is very easy to protest against Russia when you live here but it is very difficult to protest when you are in Russia.</span> <span id="s296">The Russian Government does whatever it wants to do.)</span> <span id="s297">We listened to the Voice of America in Russia and Radio performance from Canada.</span> <span id="s298">We listened to all the Russian radio stations and we knew almost everything that was going on in America.</span> <span id="s299">We heard the news, but what could we do?</span> <span id="s300">- Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">We left Russia in December 1988, we went through Austria and Italy and then came here.</span> <span id="s302">We arrived in America on March 14, 1989.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Serge learned English and Eugene, too, in preparation for coming here.</span> <span id="s304">I was busy like a squirrel, I was in all the stores in Kiev.</span> <span id="s305">I went to Moscow and Leningrad, to buy some things that I could sell in Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">(Serge: I will explain, when the Jewish people leave Russia they are allowed to take only two cases per person and $150 per person.</span> <span id="s307">So, we had $450 for our family and six cases.</span> <span id="s308">Each suitcase could weigh not more than 20 kilograms, forty pounds.</span> <span id="s309">It is nothing.</span> <span id="s310">We sent a lot of personal packages of pictures and books in three parcels to our aunt here.)</span> <span id="s311">We brought a huge library of Russian books here.</span> <span id="s312">We want Eugene to learn to read in Russian, but he doesn't want to.</span> <span id="s313">We bought some cameras to sell, and binoculars to sell, some Matrioskas and vodka to sell in Italy.</span> <span id="s314">Of course the Joint supported up and gave us some money.</span> <span id="s315">It was not enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">They wouldn't allow us to take out jewelry, even my wedding ring.</span> <span id="s317">I had to leave it with my mother.</span> <span id="s318">Now they have decided to let it come out.</span> <span id="s319">She brought it here, so now I have my ring.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Our friends who came here before us had told us about just about everything you see here.</span> <span id="s321">They told us that you have to work hard here.</span> <span id="s322">The most important thing that we were supposed to bring here was the language.</span> <span id="s323">My husband had his friend there, computer programmers too, and they told him what he would need to know, which computer languages, which systems and he studied in the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s324">We arrived here on March 4th and on March 28th, he was in his first job interview, and they hired him.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">(Serge: My friends were very helpful and it is now the same job that I did in Kiev, because everything - computers, software, hardware, are the same.</span> <span id="s326">Sometimes I think they were stolen from the U.S.A., because they are all the same.)</span> <span id="s327">My husband's parents came with us but my parents did not have an invitation so when we arrived here we called New York to a woman who prepares the invitation.</span> <span id="s328">We brought this invitation here and some man from Kiev who was my guest here took this letter to my parents in Kiev, in his pocket.</span> <span id="s329">He called them and gave them his address and they went and picked the invitation up.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">The worst time for us was in Russia when we were refused, it was terrible.</span> <span id="s331">We didn't know what to do, we didn't know what would happen, or what the future would be.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">(Serge: We couldn't find a job and in Russia if you are out of work, you are treated as if you are doing something against the law, because all the people should work.</span> <span id="s333">You are treated like an parasite.)</span> <span id="s334">The hardest thing when we arrived was the language.</span> <span id="s335">We studied English in Russia, we could read, but we could not understand it here, it became just noise.</span> <span id="s336">The best teacher for Serge is being on his job but not mine because now when I work I speak Russian.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">(Serge: We were afraid because in Russia we were told that it is very dangerous to live in America, they kill everybody, the streets are dangerous to walk in the evening and even in the daytime.</span> <span id="s338">But we can walk at anytime; it is very quiet here.)</span> <span id="s339">(The first time Eugene went to school here he could hardly communicate with other people, but it was a Russian Jewish transitional school and all the students were from Russia.</span> <span id="s340">Then, in the summer, he attended Apachi Camp and then we recognized that our son began to speak English.</span> <span id="s341">Even with his Russian friends, they speak English!</span> <span id="s342">Sometimes they speak Hebrew and sing Jewish songs.</span> <span id="s343">It is important to us that Eugene knows he is Jewish and what this means for him.)</span> <span id="s344">We now do the blessings on Shabbat, and we have a Matzo cover here and we had a Seder.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">(Serge: Not a real Seder because our parents didn't know how to do it.</span> <span id="s346">My mother cried at the Seder table because she had never had this before.</span> <span id="s347">Now our son can teach us how to do it.</span> <span id="s348">We did not have time to learn because we have to work hard here, you understand.</span> <span id="s349">Our son showed us and my mother knows a lot of Jewish songs and she likes to sing them.)</span> <span id="s350">We have a lot of Russian neighbors who are our friends now.</span> <span id="s351">Serge's mother lives with us.</span> <span id="s352">She is sixty-three and she is now doing homework, she studies in Junior College.</span> <span id="s353">My parents live five blocks from us.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">We are in America more than one year now and sometimes we cannot remember how we arrived.</span> <span id="s355">Our first impressions are confused.</span> <span id="s356">I remember that when our plane landed, everyone started to applaud, after that I don't remember anything, there were all kinds of officials and everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Then on the plane from New York to Chicago, everyone fell asleep except me.</span> <span id="s358">I was so nervous, I was praying.</span> <span id="s359">Not because I was not concerned about the flight but about our life when we arrived.</span> <span id="s360">We had flown in Russia.</span> <span id="s361">We had a relatively middle class life in Russia.</span> <span id="s362">Our parents were not in service work - like hairdressers, sales persons in department store.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">(Serge: In Russia, there is a shortage of everything so the people who are next to all this stuff are supposed to be rich.)</span> <span id="s364">One pair of shoes costs about 50 rubles in a store.</span> <span id="s365">And even with this sum, you cannot buy the shoes in the store.</span> <span id="s366">On the black market you have to pay even more, about 200 rubles.</span> <span id="s367">Usually the person doing the selling works in a store, then they can steal something and sell it someplace else.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">We had a women's rest-room in the Institute where I used to work and somebody who knows such a person, calls to everybody and we run in the bathroom and see what he or she has.</span> <span id="s369">Sometimes, at the end of the month, the stores may have something in stock, usually the stores have empty shelves.</span> <span id="s370">If they are not empty, there are not the kind of things you would like to buy.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Half the years of my married life I think I spent standing in line to buy food, to buy clothes, to buy everything that you need in your home.</span> <span id="s372">When we came here we knew this was very different in America.</span> <span id="s373">We saw it in Austria and Italy so we were prepared.</span> <span id="s374">We understood that it would be this way here.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">(Serge: This is a card which allows you to buy one kilogram of sugar in a shop.</span> <span id="s376">If you don't have this card you cannot buy.</span> <span id="s377">You still need to pay your own money, but without the card you could buy none.</span> <span id="s378">Everybody gets these cards each month.</span> <span id="s379">If you don't need it, - but usually people need more.</span> <span id="s380">We brought these cards to show our children what it was like.)</span> <span id="s381">In Russia there is really not anything on the shelf.</span> <span id="s382">Sometimes there is no salt, no sugar, no tea, no coffee.</span> <span id="s383">Sometimes we receive letters from our friends, saying they are out of this or that.</span> <span id="s384">We really cannot send to everyone, we would have to buy out a Dominick's because we have so many friends still there.</span> <span id="s385">Because of the lack of everything, people in Russia are very angry and they are looking for a victim - a scapegoat to blame.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Our friends there are afraid to be too clear in their letters because nobody can be sure that no one will read the letter before we do.</span> <span id="s387">Before I send a letter back, I check every letter before I send it because I do not want to make trouble for my friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">(Serge: For many years we were concerned for our son, because he needs to grow up and we felt he needed to live in another place than Russia.</span> <span id="s389">We always wanted to come here and after we got this guy, we decided to do our best to come here.)</span> <span id="s390">You know, about Eugene, we tell him only that we are trying to do.</span> <span id="s391">We didn't want to bother him about everything around him, about the Soviet Union, etc.</span> <span id="s392">We want him to be a person and if he will be smart enough to be a doctor or a lawyer, that would be fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">(Serge: We also understand that it does not matter here if he is Jewish or, I don't know what.</span> <span id="s394">We feel that he should learn and know what everyone around him knows, to be on the same level.)</span> <span id="s395">I don't want to lie to you, that when we decided to leave Russia that Chernobyl was a huge influence.</span> <span id="s396">We lived about 50 or 60 miles from this town.</span> <span id="s397">We didn't know anything about this disaster.</span> <span id="s398">We first heard about it from the Voice of America.</span> <span id="s399">America told us first what we had to do, that we had to have some treatment, some cure.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">(Serge: This was four years ago, and the Russian government didn't tell anything to people.</span> <span id="s401">A lot of people lived in the places where it was impossible to leave.</span> <span id="s402">The level of radiation was very high and we tried to keep our son safe so in four days when we knew about this disaster, Lena took him to the train and she went to Moscow to stay with relatives, and then her mother came to her there and they travelled around a bit.)</span> <span id="s403">We couldn't understand all of it.</span> <span id="s404">What did it mean?</span> <span id="s405">It happened on a Friday night and I was in the market on Monday, at work, and my friends asked me "Did you hear about such and such?"</span> <span id="s406">And I said, "Where's Chernobyl, where's Kiev? "</span> <span id="s407">We couldn't believe that it was so dangerous.</span> <span id="s408">We couldn't believe that the Russian government would not allow people to leave this place.</span> <span id="s409">Now we understand.</span> <span id="s410">For half a year our son stayed with our parents out of Kiev, but then he had to come back, because we had no place for him to live anymore.</span> <span id="s411">All this time we were in Kiev, we locked all the windows, we made the wet cleaning every day and we tried to get our food from Moscow, we bought food especially for our son from Moscow.</span> <span id="s412">We had to go to Moscow.</span> <span id="s413">We went on train, it took one night, ten hours.</span> <span id="s414">But a lot of people didn't believe it and they ate whatever they could buy in Kiev.</span> <span id="s415">We had to buy in Kiev but we asked from what area, what village, the food came from.</span> <span id="s416">We tried to keep ourselves well, we did our best.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">When there was the damage at Chernobyl Station, nobody told us, not radio, television, nobody!</span> <span id="s418">Nobody said it is very dangerous to stay here in Kiev - take your children and stay away as far as you can and as quick as you can.</span> <span id="s419">But we have friends, we had our radio and we could hear the Voice of America in Russian, and we did what they suggested and now we are old enough to understand that it is very dangerous for our kid and not only for him, for us too, but we did the best we could.</span> <span id="s420">We evacuated Serge's mother again.</span> <span id="s421">She didn't want to go - "You're crazy, its not so dangerous."</span> <span id="s422">Nobody understood.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">(Serge: It is very common for the Soviet government to tell the people that everything is good, everything is fine, only good and they don't tell anything bad.</span> <span id="s424">The Soviet people didn't know about disasters, so many bad things happened in those years in Russia.</span> <span id="s425">And now that this Perestroika started, people started to hear many things from the government, radio stations, newspapers, magazines, we can see that it is not so good, it is really very bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">(It was like that all the time, even when World War II started.</span> <span id="s427">People didn't know exactly what was going on, because the government told them, "Our Army is strong and it will beat the Fascists."</span> <span id="s428">But, the Army couldn't win and one town had to leave and then another town had to leave and so the Fascists came close to Kiev and then people understood that we would be crushed by the Fascists and a lot of people started to go to the East.</span> <span id="s429">But the Russian Government didn't tell anybody to go.</span> <span id="s430">They indicated the only thing that should leave was important papers and important people.)</span> <span id="s431">Nobody told the Jews, "You have to go.</span> <span id="s432">Go from here or you will be killed!"</span> <span id="s433">And a lot of people believed it would be all right and they were killed at Baby Yar.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">This was the same problem after the Chernobyl disaster, nobody said, "You should probably go from here and take your child."</span> <span id="s435">It happened that the Ministry of Health told all the people it wasn't dangerous but they could do whatever they wanted.</span> <span id="s436">Now we know that it was very, very dangerous.</span> <span id="s437">But this is the common way in Russia, no one tells of dangers, only the good things, nothing bad.</span> <span id="s438">People didn't know anything because they didn't get any information.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">(When the Chernobyl disaster happened, you could only get information from the American radio stations.</span> <span id="s440">There was a lot of information about medicines, and you should do this and you should do that.</span> <span id="s441">Russian Government said nothing, and this is usual in Russia.</span> <span id="s442">So people believed the government and they didn't know what was going on.)</span> <span id="s443">I remember the last time when we were in the Soviet Union and we wanted to send our parcels with books here.</span> <span id="s444">We put this parcel in the seat on the bus and there was one woman and she didn't like this and she said, "Kikes, go away to your Israel."</span> <span id="s445">And I answered, "I'd like to, but it is very hard."</span> <span id="s446">So, you can accommodate for any condition.</span> <span id="s447">In the Soviet Union, in America, in Israel, people can adjust, so we can too.</span> <span id="s448">We adjusted to life in the Soviet Union and it was not a big surprise for us, to hear this kind of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">(Serge: What is going on in Russia now is not good.</span> <span id="s450">This Perestroika has been going on now for three years and it gets worse and worse each day.</span> <span id="s451">It will probably not be any good for some years.</span> <span id="s452">There may be another kind of Civil War or Revolution, I don't know.)</span> <span id="s453">As I understand, we can't do anything, because the government doesn't respect people - people's lives mean nothing.</span> <span id="s454">On the contrary, when the government doesn't work for the people, they are very talkative.</span> <span id="s455">A lot of information came from different places in Russia.</span> <span id="s456">We know that in the forties, more people were killed than were killed during the World War.</span> <span id="s457">Killed by Stalin and his staff.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">(Serge: It is very interesting.</span> <span id="s459">When we studied in school, the history of Stalin was not mentioned.</span> <span id="s460">It looks like it doesn't exist.</span> <span id="s461">I told you the government only tells you good things and what they want you to know about these times.</span> <span id="s462">Now we find that there is a lot of history outside the Soviet Union that we never heard of.</span> <span id="s463">Even now, a lot of students in Russia don't pass the exam about History because, everybody knows that the textbooks lie, lie, lie.)</span> <span id="s464">You should know that the History of the Soviet Union is a common subject in absolutely all institutes and universities.</span> <span id="s465">Not History of Soviet Union but history of the Communist Party!!!</span> <span id="s466">Makes no difference if you are artist or doctor, you should study this for at least three years.</span> <span id="s467">You have to know the history of the Communist Party.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">They never mentioned any Jews being part of the Communist Party.</span> <span id="s469">They just talk about the Soviets - a new people.</span> <span id="s470">They never mention that the founders were Jews, or Ukrainians, or Russians.</span> <span id="s471">We got a bunch of magazines in New York, they are very, very progressive magazines from the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s472">In this magazine they put all kinds of true information for people in the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s473">They tell people the truth about their past history.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">My mother, when I was already an adult, told us about some very, very sad stories about the history of those times.</span> <span id="s475">Like a history of doctors.</span> <span id="s476">A very famous history that most doctors in those times, who were Jewish people, and a lot of professors who were very famous specialists.</span> <span id="s477">They were big among the specialists in America and abroad, and they were Jews.</span> <span id="s478">Stalin was anti-Semitic and the government said that these people in the white uniforms were killers.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">(Serge: In the early 1950s the Stalin government decided to move all Jewish people from the European part of the Soviet Union to the Far East.</span> <span id="s480">There was a very small area where they decided to move all the Jews.</span> <span id="s481">The only thing that saved the Jews, was Stalin's death.</span> <span id="s482">Because if he had lived a few more years all the Russian Jews would have gone to Siberia.)</span> <span id="s483">(Serge: Actually, we had a lot of jokes about Siberia.</span> <span id="s484">There were really not so many people who were sent there.)</span> <span id="s485">You didn't know about this, because you weren't interested in it.</span> <span id="s486">Okay.</span> <span id="s487">We weren't interested in this because we were a target and we worked very hard.</span> <span id="s488">We weren't interested in politics because we would read one thing in the paper and think about other things.</span> <span id="s489">You know, we were living together for ten years in the Soviet Union, we were married there.</span> <span id="s490">And during these ten years we didn't read newspapers.</span> <span id="s491">We would watch news on TV but that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Our parents were not interested in these things.</span> <span id="s493">And we didn't discuss politics or Jewish culture in Russia.</span> <span id="s494">We did not discuss this in the family or elsewhere.</span> <span id="s495">We didn't know anything and we weren't interested in what we read in the paper because they would say, "This is good, and that is good."</span> <span id="s496">We could look outside and know that this was not the truth.</span> <span id="s497">So, we did not really get good information.</span> <span id="s498">We had no information except the Voice of America.</span> <span id="s499">And we could only catch this in the deep night when we were sure no one else could hear.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A lot of people, and our friends, also listened to this but no one tried to discuss it.</span> <span id="s501">You could be put in prison for this.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">If people, for a long time, cannot discuss political issues, we tried not to do it at all.</span> <span id="s503">If you tried to go against the government, you could be put in prison.</span> <span id="s504">We were young, we had to study, we were very busy and we had our own lives to work on.</span> <span id="s505">After we were refused permission to leave in the Soviet Union we decided to live very quietly, especially when we, fortunately, found jobs.</span> <span id="s506">This record about how we attempted to leave Russia, it was all about us.</span> <span id="s507">The only thing which is allowed in Russia, is to work, work, work, and to read Pravda.</span> <span id="s508">But to really understand what was going on?</span> <span id="s509">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">None of our close friends were ever sent to jail but we heard about those people whom we didn't know.</span> <span id="s511">Such names, and probably you can meet someone we know very well, and they would ask if we remembered so-and-so and that they were put in prison.</span> <span id="s512">People know not to ask dangerous questions.</span> <span id="s513">We did not want to get in trouble.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">I know now that there are no Refuseniks left in the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s515">Our friends were Refuseniks, they were very active as students but now they are ?</span></p> <p><span id="s516">(Serge: They had a lot of trouble in Russia.</span> <span id="s517">The police would sometimes come to their house and make investigation.</span> <span id="s518">They reported first my girl friend's husband and made him leave Kiev.</span> <span id="s519">He was sent to Siberia.)</span> <span id="s520">It is important to us that our son understand his Jewish background because our culture, our Jewish history, was stolen from us, we had this stolen from us and we want Eugene to really be proud that he is Jewish.</span> <span id="s521">The same way others are proud they are Armenian, or Russian.</span> <span id="s522">That it is more important that he knows these differences are not important, that the kind of personality one has, and if you are a good and intelligent person, this is more important than anything else, in my opinion.</span> <span id="s523">Because a people without roots is not a good thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">(Serge: It is hard for us to know what else might be important to tell you about.</span> <span id="s525">If you would like to know more about our life in Russia, or our life here, or the history of our families, I don't know what would be interesting.)</span> <span id="s526">You know, we are thirty-five, and we lived thirty-four years in the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s527">We had many sad, and funny, and interesting stories.</span> <span id="s528">I know we all have these stories, and I don't know which would be best to tell you.</span> <span id="s529">It is also hard, because of the English.</span> <span id="s530">Sometimes I can't find the right words to explain.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">I can say that I was very surprised here when I got my job in the J.C.C. and the first event we had there was the Shabbat Basket delivery and I saw maybe twenty or more American-Jewish families, young like you and we are.</span> <span id="s532">They came, all families, kids, even babies, and they took this basket and they spent the whole time with their kids and friends to do something very important to them.</span> <span id="s533">They took these baskets and they gave their time to say, "Shalom," to unknown people, to strangers.</span> <span id="s534">After a regular working day.</span> <span id="s535">And I understand that in America it is very good to be a volunteer.</span> <span id="s536">This we did not see in the Soviet Union.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">I think it is great, it is terrific.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">(Serge: In the Soviet Union we didn't know anything about Jewish history or Jewish culture, or language.</span> <span id="s539">We knew that we were Jews, but what did it mean?</span> <span id="s540">There it was not something good.)</span> <span id="s541">All our friends send their kids to the Shalom Sunday School at the J.C.C. Most of them send their kids to Russian-Jewish schools.</span> <span id="s542">I know that we didn't have a chance to do a circumcision on Eugene when he was born so we have had this done now.</span> <span id="s543">My brother now has two sons, eighteen and six, so next week we have appointments to have the circumcisions for the both of them.</span> <span id="s544">And our neighbors, our friends, they live upstairs, and they did the circumcision yesterday.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">(Serge: We know this is not the most important thing, but people never knew about their culture and now they are trying to participate in all the activities.</span> <span id="s546">And it is very good for us.)</span> <span id="s547">We go with Eugene on some Sundays to the school, and he likes it very much.</span> <span id="s548">He likes to go to school and to the Sunday School because they are always doing something very interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">(Serge: Once we were very surprised.</span> <span id="s550">We were strolling the street with our friends, and the children were playing and then we realized that they were singing songs in Hebrew.</span> <span id="s551">Our sons!</span> <span id="s552">They really enjoy this and they never did this before.</span> <span id="s553">It will come to be their nature the more they understand.)</span></p></body></html>
