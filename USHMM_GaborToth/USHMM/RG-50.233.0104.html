JANINA PROT</span></p> <p><span id="s2">APRIL 1, 1992</span></p> <p><span id="s3">LEXINGTON, MASSACHUSETTS Dr. Prot, could you please tell me your name and the date of your birth and the place of birth.</span></p> <p><span id="s4">Please don't call me Dr. Prot, my name is Jana.</span> <span id="s5">It is my nickname and my full name is Janina and my last name is Prot.</span> <span id="s6">Oh, they don't work.</span> <span id="s7">I was born on February 8, 1926 in Poland, in a small town named Nowe Miasto, near Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s8">Could you tell me about your childhood, what was it like growing up in your town, and what was your family like, did you have brothers and sisters?</span> <span id="s9">What did you like to do?</span> <span id="s10">Anything you can remember about that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Well I can remember plenty.</span> <span id="s12">I grew up mostly in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s13">But in my childhood I changed my place of living because my parents were divorced, and part of my childhood I spent with my father and part with my mother.</span> <span id="s14">I have a brother who is two years younger and for some time, before the war, we were separated, because he was with my mother, I was with my father.</span> <span id="s15">There were plenty of family problems.</span> <span id="s16">My father had some kind of high position in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">What did he do?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">He was a director of a big factory of munitions and explosive materials in Poland.</span> <span id="s19">I was living with him near Radom in a small town Pionki which was near a big factory.</span> <span id="s20">We lived in a big house with a big garden.</span> <span id="s21">I didn't go to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">You didn't?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">No, in Pionki was a small country-like elementary school, and my father did not want to send me to this kind of school because the education was not too good.</span> <span id="s24">So, I was taught at home with two other girls with a private tutor and we had lessons at home.</span> <span id="s25">In the afternoon I had to do my homework, as all children.</span> <span id="s26">Once a year I had to take some small exam, it was a government requirement that I have enough education to start another class.</span> <span id="s27">This way I practically never went to school except the last year before the war, when we moved to Warsaw and I started with they call in Poland "Gymnasium"--a junior high.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Could you tell me about your religious life in your home, or respective homes with your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Now we have started one of the complicated parts of my life.</span> <span id="s30">My parents converted to Catholicism before I was born.</span> <span id="s31">Most of my family were completely, as they say, "assimilated" family.</span> <span id="s32">They never feel they have too much to do with Jewish habits.</span> <span id="s33">My father, I think, was the biggest Polish patriot that I ever met in my life, and I think almost everybody on my father's side, probably in the 20's, after the first war, converted to Catholicism or to Protestantism.</span> <span id="s34">Not in my mother's family.</span> <span id="s35">My mother was, I think, only one.</span> <span id="s36">So I grew up as a Catholic girl.</span> <span id="s37">My parents were not very religious in any religion but officially they were Catholic, and I was brought up with other children, so they wanted me probably to be the same as the other girls.</span> <span id="s38">I was baptized, and I went to First Communion being, I think, 8 years old.</span> <span id="s39">I didn't know that I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s40">We never talk about it at home.</span> <span id="s41">I knew that we are a little different and it was hard for me to figure out what is really different.</span> <span id="s42">I knew that we are different than the other people.</span> <span id="s43">My parents never went to the church.</span> <span id="s44">But if I wanted to go to the church with the other girls or if I wanted to go to the church with a servant, it was permitted; it was fine.</span> <span id="s45">I really discovered who am I when the war started and we all discovered that we are not Poles anymore, that we are Jews and we are treated as Jews by everybody around.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">But otherwise, people didn't know, or they did know?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Oh, yes, of course, everybody knew.</span> <span id="s48">It was some kind of thing that tactful people don't talk about.</span> <span id="s49">We are living between educated, intellectual people and many of them have what they call in Poland, mixed marriages.</span> <span id="s50">One of them was Jew, one of them was Pole, and almost everybody has some grandmother who is a Jew.</span> <span id="s51">And probably until late 30's I don't know if my father really felt a big antisemitism.</span> <span id="s52">I think later something started, because I remember that about '38 or the beginning of '39 he started to talk that he would like to quit his job, which was very well paid, and also I think he enjoyed what he was doing.</span> <span id="s53">I never had an opportunity to ask him; I was a child.</span> <span id="s54">And personally, I was living in some kind of isolated area, I didn't go to school, I was living with my father being taught at home.</span> <span id="s55">It was practically not even possible to be exposed to the Polish antisemitism.</span> <span id="s56">I knew that it existed; I knew it was something really bad, but I never took it personally.</span> <span id="s57">I grew up in very liberal house.</span> <span id="s58">It was bad to be antisemitic, it was bad to think that black people are different and all people should be equal.</span> <span id="s59">You can imagine how it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Also, I imagine you didn't have too many black people.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">No, no, but there was this kind of feeling in the house.</span> <span id="s62">People are equal.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Can I ask you more about your childhood.</span> <span id="s64">Do you remember if you had any interest or hobbies, or music, or things that you pursued or enjoyed to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">I don't think so.</span> <span id="s66">I was a very unhappy, socially isolated child.</span> <span id="s67">I was unhappy because my parents were divorced.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">How old were you when they were divorced?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">I was about 4 years old.</span> <span id="s70">And they were constantly fighting to have the children.</span> <span id="s71">My father wanted to have both of us and my mother, of course wanted to have both of us.</span> <span id="s72">And we were constantly for different reasons, switched from one parent to the other.</span> <span id="s73">My mother was a very tense, nervous, anxious, neurotic person.</span> <span id="s74">I was much more happy with my father.</span> <span id="s75">But my mother, when I was with her for vacation, was constantly telling me, "How come you are with your father, you should be with your mother.</span> <span id="s76">You are a girl, and children should stay with mother," and so on and so on.</span> <span id="s77">I was really a very shy, unhappy and frustrated child.</span> <span id="s78">I was a very good student and I was reading books from age 5.</span> <span id="s79">I had times I was reading two books per day.</span> <span id="s80">Everyone was looking and saying, "What sort of wonderful child, reading and reading and reading."</span> <span id="s81">No, it was my escape--not to be exposed to the family problem, not to play with children where they could ask me, where is your mother?</span> <span id="s82">I always had very strong feelings that I am different.</span> <span id="s83">It was a very difficult childhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Was this up through your teenagerhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">No, I was a teenager during the war.</span> <span id="s86">I was also unhappy but in a different way.</span> <span id="s87">The war started when I was 13, and just before the war I moved to Warsaw, with my brother to my mother's apartment and we stayed with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Can you tell me when you found out you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">I remember one talk with a maid.</span> <span id="s90">I was probably 7 years old, I wanted to go with her to the church.</span> <span id="s91">My grandmother, my paternal grandmother, was living with us when I was with my father.</span> <span id="s92">I really didn't like her, she was very victorian, very rigid and stiff and constantly trying to correct my behavior.</span> <span id="s93">I remember telling the maid, "I know why she doesn't want me to go to the church--because she is Jewish."</span> <span id="s94">And I remember the maid looking around and didn't know what to say.</span> <span id="s95">So I knew there was something around.</span> <span id="s96">I cannot clearly tell you when I found out, probably I was about 12, but still the people didn't talk about it.</span> <span id="s97">It was full denial.</span> <span id="s98">Of course, immediately after the war, we all find out who we are.</span> <span id="s99">Nothing more, nothing less, but the Jews...</span></p> <p><span id="s100">After the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">When the war started.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Do you want to talk about that a little, where were you, what was going on, what did you end up doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">War started, as you know, September 1, '39.</span> <span id="s104">I came from vacation, the last vacation I spent with my father, to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s105">The war started and we moved from our apartment which was on the north part in Warsaw in Bielany to the huge apartment of my aunt who was a sister of my father.</span> <span id="s106">For a reason I was never able to understand, everybody had the feeling that it was more safe to be in the downtown Warsaw than all around.</span> <span id="s107">Life showed that it was completely different.</span> <span id="s108">And then it was the siege of the Warsaw.</span> <span id="s109">We stayed all time with the apartment of my aunt and her husband and her daughter which was 10 years older at this time and also their daughter-in-law because the son, my cousin was in the army, an officer in the army.</span> <span id="s110">So his wife was in this big apartment and her three-months-old child.</span> <span id="s111">It was a 7 or 8 room apartment in downtown Warsaw.</span> <span id="s112">And September 25, it was the worst bombardment of Warsaw.</span> <span id="s113">And one of the first bomb drop on this house.</span> <span id="s114">My cousin was killed at the place, wife of my cousin and three-month-old baby was killed and her mother was killed.</span> <span id="s115">Four people were killed, being about, I don't know, five yards from me.</span> <span id="s116">Soon the house collapsed and we stayed in the basement of the collapsed house.</span> <span id="s117">We survived--my aunt, her husband, my mother, my brother, and myself.</span> <span id="s118">The first phase of the war finished, Warsaw gave up, it was September 29 or 30, and we went back to our apartment on the north part of the Warsaw.</span> <span id="s119">It was not badly destroyed, no glass in the windows, but otherwise it was the same as before.</span> <span id="s120">Then we discovered that we don't have any money.</span> <span id="s121">My father disappeared, we knew he was in the army, we did not know if he was killed or what has happened.</span> <span id="s122">And, also, I think my mother knew that the pressure against Jews had started.</span> <span id="s123">I think in October or November of 1939, it was the order that the Jews had put the armband with the Star of the David.</span> <span id="s124">Of course we didn't.</span> <span id="s125">We are in complete denial that we are not, we are not Jews, but we knew that we are.</span> <span id="s126">And I think the landlords, owner of the house where we were living, he probably knew it.</span> <span id="s127">People knew of these kinds of things.</span> <span id="s128">So we are hanging around, not having too much money, even to buy bread.</span> <span id="s129">In November '39, my father showed up from the army.</span> <span id="s130">He knew very well that he could not stay in Poland for many reasons.</span> <span id="s131">He started immediately to try to go through the green border, illegally, to Hungary.</span> <span id="s132">Finally, he went to Hungary at the end of December 1939 and from Hungary to France and from France to England and I never saw him again.</span> <span id="s133">So the last time I saw him it was for a brief time in December or November 1939.</span> <span id="s134">And we decided to move from Warsaw to some kind of convent which was near Warsaw and my mother had good friends there.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Could you tell me a little bit about this convent?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">It was an interesting place.</span> <span id="s137">The convent was of Franciscan Sisters.</span> <span id="s138">It was organized by Mother Czacka.</span> <span id="s139">The congregation was quite liberal and plenty of people from Catholic-Polish aristocracy from intellectual circles, they stick to this convent--it was what they call French Catholicism.</span> <span id="s140">The Sisters were running schools and workshops for blind children.</span> <span id="s141">Mother Czacka, the Mother Superior, was blind herself.</span> <span id="s142">Some Jewish intellectuals were also connected with this convent.</span> <span id="s143">Two nuns in high position were of Jewish origin--they converted.</span> <span id="s144">My mother knew some of them before the war and was very friendly with them.</span> <span id="s145">In December, 1939, they invited us to stay there.</span> <span id="s146">They could not give us so much as an apartment, but I got a room and my mother could help with the garden, which she loved to do and I can go to school.</span> <span id="s147">Whatever, I don't think we had a clear plan on what we would be doing.</span> <span id="s148">I think everyone hoped that the war would be finished in one year.</span> <span id="s149">So we would survive one year.</span> <span id="s150">Nobody expected what really happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">So, in the very end of 1939 we pack our belongings with very few of our furniture, some basic things and moved to Laski, which was 10 kilometers north of Warsaw.</span> <span id="s152">We stayed in a small apartment, my mother was working helping in the garden; or sometimes in the kitchen whatever was needed.</span> <span id="s153">My brother stayed mostly home and for the first year I was simply helping--I remember working in the kitchen or in the washroom or doing whatever needs to be done.</span> <span id="s154">I was bored to death, it was nothing to do, nothing to read, it was no people in my age, I was not allowed to go, of course, to Warsaw or any other place.</span> <span id="s155">Probably here is the good place to say that I did not look like a Polish girl.</span> <span id="s156">I had very black hair, black eyes, rather dark skin and obviously, it was difficult for me to walk on a Warsaw street, not being asked, "Hey, stop, you are Jewish?"</span> <span id="s157">or "Are you a Jew?"</span> <span id="s158">My brother didn't look like a Polish child either with curly black hair, but he was not circumcised, and this way it was easier to save him than it was to save me.</span> <span id="s159">My mother, if we were talking how we looked--she looked wonderful, she absolutely didn't look Jewish; nobody ever suspected that she was Jewish.</span> <span id="s160">She had a small, very pretty face, completely grey hair and she did not have any problem when she was walking around.</span> <span id="s161">The difficulty was our documents.</span> <span id="s162">We keep our name Prot because it doesn't have any Polish, Jewish or any other meaning, but my mother's maiden name is Dajches.</span> <span id="s163">She was Zosia Dajches.</span> <span id="s164">So all our documents were changed and my mother's maiden name was given Kossouth, what is a typical Hungarian name and it was given in this goal so that if someone was asking during the war, "Oh, you look somewhat strange, you look Jewish, you have so black hair" I was telling immediately, "Oh, yes, I have black hair because my grandmother was Hungarian, you know.</span> <span id="s165">My mother's name is Kossouth."</span> <span id="s166">And the documents were changed with the help of the nuns, where we stayed and I think it were very good documents.</span> <span id="s167">We had baptismal documents.</span> <span id="s168">It was filled out in church's books, so it was possible to check that it is not false.</span> <span id="s169">Some priests were able to do this if they wanted to false the records in church books.</span> <span id="s170">So, we had not too bad documents for the war.</span> <span id="s171">Do you want to know what happened to me later?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Yes, if you want to give this straight narrative -- you were in the convent.</span> <span id="s173">.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Then--I am in the convent, it was about 1940.</span> <span id="s175">All this year we stayed together, my mother, my brother and myself.</span> <span id="s176">It was very hard, it was very poor, it was not enough food.</span> <span id="s177">We did not have enough clothes, but we felt quite safe.</span> <span id="s178">In 1940, it was the feeling that the war would not finish so quickly.</span> <span id="s179">I tried to press my mother very badly that I would like to go back to school, and I begged her to go back to Warsaw because I want to go to school, to my gymnasium and it is not possible for me to lose so much time.</span> <span id="s180">My mother had friends in Warsaw and they agreed to take me and to stay with their children and I would be able to live with them and go to school.</span> <span id="s181">I moved with them--I'm sure they knew who am I. I am quite sure.</span> <span id="s182">Of course, we never talk about it.</span> <span id="s183">It was some kind of agreement that it would be complete denial.</span> <span id="s184">They don't know I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s185">I have all my documents, I am a Polish girl with a Polish name, I am Catholic.</span> <span id="s186">It was very helpful that I knew Catholic religion very well and of course, all prayers.</span> <span id="s187">It was no problem for me to go to the church and I knew how to behave during the Mass.</span> <span id="s188">It was a big help.</span> <span id="s189">I went to school and it was difficult for the first year and then the next year, how it was?</span> <span id="s190">It was about 1941 I stayed with these friends for about half a year and then I was quite unhappy with their children.</span> <span id="s191">It was very cold, it was somewhat dirty and I was hungry all the time and my mother decided that I am big enough--I was about 14 or 15--that I could live alone.</span> <span id="s192">She arranged another place, because no one had money for a room, but through some friends that found an older woman who wanted to have some company and she rented me a bed in her room.</span> <span id="s193">It was in Zoliborz, it was more close to my school and I stayed with her.</span> <span id="s194">She was a nice woman and I was going to school.</span> <span id="s195">Remember, I had to cook for myself, I had to feed myself and it was absolutely nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s196">I was awfully, terribly hungry all day long.</span> <span id="s197">I had only this rationed which was possible to buy.</span> <span id="s198">Of course, you could buy all kinds of things during the war on the black market, but I didn't have any money.</span> <span id="s199">So, for dinner I cooked some kind of kasha and I ate the piece of bread for breakfast, and this kasha that I cooked with water, I ate in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s200">I remember being very, very hungry.</span> <span id="s201">Now I have to move back a little bit.</span> <span id="s202">The ghetto was organized much earlier, but it was more south from the part of the town where I was living, and I avoid very much going to the downtown.</span> <span id="s203">I was living in the north part of Warsaw-Bielany and later in Zoliborz.</span> <span id="s204">The school was in Zoliborz, and I practically never go downtown because it was very unsafe.</span> <span id="s205">The few times that I went, I saw the wall of the ghetto and the streetcar was going through the ghetto.</span> <span id="s206">It was a big ghetto and a small ghetto connected by a wooden bridge.</span> <span id="s207">The streetcar was going through ghetto, not stopping of course.</span> <span id="s208">And I remember on one of my trips through the ghetto, it was probably in 1941, I took the streetcar and then it was possible to see the streets through the streetcar windows.</span> <span id="s209">And then I saw dead people lying on the streets.</span> <span id="s210">This I remember, dead boys and children covered with newspaper.</span> <span id="s211">I didn't know what to do, I didn't know to look, or not to look, or what to do.</span> <span id="s212">This I remember very clearly.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Did people talk about when the streetcar went through the ghetto?</span> <span id="s214">No one said a word?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">No.</span> <span id="s216">Windows were blocked in some towns.</span> <span id="s217">If you see the movie Europa, Europa--I'm sure you did--he's looking through some kind of scratch.</span> <span id="s218">If I remember correctly, the windows were not blocked in this streetcar that I took, and shortly after this it was some change in the relationship between big ghetto and small ghetto.</span> <span id="s219">I think small ghetto was liquidated and the streetcar was not going anymore through ghetto.</span> <span id="s220">Only along the wall that we see the Port Brama-entrance with Polish and German police.</span> <span id="s221">At this time, sometime you are able to see Jews on the street going to do some work in the town.</span> <span id="s222">Of course with German soldier or police with guns.</span> <span id="s223">Sometimes we saw this small group of Jews out of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s224">I think it was about 1941-42.</span> <span id="s225">Also, this was probably in 1941, I was inside the ghetto only once during the war.</span> <span id="s226">Should I tell you the story about what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Yes, please.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">I went downtown Warsaw with some other children of my friends who were half-Jewish and half-Polish.</span> <span id="s229">We were very stupid.</span> <span id="s230">We tried to change streetcar near the ghetto wall which was the most dangerous place, because the people hanging around we call, in Poland, szmakownik.</span> <span id="s231">Do you know what is szmakownik?</span> <span id="s232">Informers.</span> <span id="s233">The people who pick you up in the street and "Oh, you are Jew, and give us money.</span> <span id="s234">If not, we are going to the police."</span> <span id="s235">So we stop there on the street, at the streetcar stop near the ghetto entrance and, of course, immediately they pick us.</span> <span id="s236">My friend was a little older, I was about 14 and she was, I think, 16.</span> <span id="s237">They took us to the police station at the entrance to the ghetto, and inside the ghetto to some kind of, I remember, big room and they started to ask us for documents and what we are doing.</span> <span id="s238">You are Jews and how come we are out of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s239">We are sitting and I keep telling them, "We are not Jews, absolutely not.</span> <span id="s240">This is a mistake.</span> <span id="s241">Please let us go, it is a mistake."</span> <span id="s242">I do not know how, I and the other girl, how we had the nerve to tell that.</span> <span id="s243">In some moment it came this, I remember very clearly, some older man, a Jew with a band on his arm, and he came to me and asked me "Why you don't have a band?"</span> <span id="s244">So I said, "I am not Jewish; there is no reason for me to have an armband."</span> <span id="s245">Oh, how come, you are Jewish, it's enough to look at you.</span> <span id="s246">You are Jewish and I don't understand, but if you will give me some money I can help you.</span> <span id="s247">Do you have parents?</span> <span id="s248">I can call them where you are.</span> <span id="s249">I can help you if you give me some money.</span> <span id="s250">It was clear that he was working with the police and I look at him and I told him very firmly, "I am not Jewish and please go away and leave me alone."</span> <span id="s251">He went away, and then the Polish policeman came and asked me about documents.</span> <span id="s252">I did not have enough because I don't have yet Kennkarte; the Kennkarte was given when you were 16.</span> <span id="s253">I found a small piece of paper, from school what I was attending one year before the war.</span> <span id="s254">It was a Catholic school.</span> <span id="s255">I show him this and told him "Do you think if I would be Jewish, I would be going to Catholic school before the war?"</span> <span id="s256">He looked at us and he let us go.</span> <span id="s257">He pushed us through the entrance and we took the streetcar.</span> <span id="s258">Since then I knew very well I have to keep far away from this place.</span> <span id="s259">In 1942, I was still going to school and was living with this woman but I started to have problems at this time.</span> <span id="s260">I think the woman did not know who I am, but I remember a few times they picked me on the street, this Polish informer, they told me "oh, you are Jewish, go with us."</span> <span id="s261">Mostly I tried to tell them, "No I am not, go away."</span> <span id="s262">Because I knew that once I would tell them, "Yes", or if I would give them some money, it would be the end.</span> <span id="s263">And some people, even in school, they asked me, some girls they ask me, Why you look so Jewish and I always tell the story: "Well, I have black hair because I am Hungarian descendent."</span> <span id="s264">But it was, I don't know how to tell you, it started to be as I was constantly, day and night, twenty-four hours on the stage.</span> <span id="s265">That I am playing somebody that I am not.</span> <span id="s266">When in this situation, somebody pick you up on the street frequently, the Jewish people became very confused.</span> <span id="s267">You could see fear on their faces.</span> <span id="s268">I learn not to have it on my face.</span> <span id="s269">I learn when they pick me up to smile and say,"Ha, ha, how funny."</span> <span id="s270">But I remember psychologically I was somewhat exhausted.</span> <span id="s271">It was denial and denial and it was no one with whom I could talk openly.</span> <span id="s272">Absolutely nobody.</span> <span id="s273">Because even it was some friends I would be with and I knew that they know, but it was taboo.</span> <span id="s274">We never talk about it; never admit that they know; never talk about this problem.</span> <span id="s275">You might think it is funny, but time to time when my mother visited me, we never talked about it!</span> <span id="s276">It was denial between my mother and myself.</span> <span id="s277">It was something that we never, never talk about.</span> <span id="s278">My mother always told me, remember you are Hungarian, and I knew why she was saying this, but it was impossible to say, "We'll talk about it."</span> <span id="s279">Talk about what has happened to the rest of the family?</span> <span id="s280">Never, never.</span> <span id="s281">To make things more complicated, at this time my mother had to move from this convent where she was staying with my brother.</span> <span id="s282">I think it was 1942, and one day they told her that there are some informers telling the police that she is Jewish and that my brother is a Jew, and they told them if they did not go away in a few hours, they will be taken to the police.</span> <span id="s283">So my mother took my brother, leaving everything absolutely behind, I think she took some clothes with her and as much money as they had, as they had not too much, of course, and they went by foot to Warsaw and then I know from her stories, she did not have any place to go.</span> <span id="s284">She was walking on the street in Warsaw, keeping by hand this very Jewish-looking boy.</span> <span id="s285">She did not have anyplace to go, and it would be curfew in a few hours.</span> <span id="s286">It was in summer, 1942, it became the evening and you cannot stay on the street.</span> <span id="s287">It was some small hospital, in downtown Warsaw run by nuns.</span> <span id="s288">My mother knocked to the door of this small hospital.</span> <span id="s289">The nun opened and my mother told the nun, "This boy is very sick and he has to be in the hospital right now."</span> <span id="s290">The nun, of course, did not want to take him and my mother almost forced herself into--I told you my mother always looked very elegant--and told her, "I am very sorry, dear nun, but he has appendicitis and has to be operated on now."</span> <span id="s291">So the nun did not know what to do, but she opened the door and put my brother to the bed.</span> <span id="s292">The next day, I don't know if the doctor was seeing him or not.</span> <span id="s293">My mother left him with the nun as a very sick child in the bed, and went around Warsaw to find a place where they can take him.</span> <span id="s294">I think some friends took him for a few days, and then he was placed in an orphanage with the children of the Polish officers who perished during the war.</span> <span id="s295">It was special organization helping this kind of children named R. G. O., Rada Gto'wna Opiekun'esa.</span> <span id="s296">They had some houses where they took children who did not have fathers.</span> <span id="s297">So my brother remained in the orphanage, my mother took a job as a helper of sick woman with children, or a tutor of children, or a live-in maid.</span> <span id="s298">I was going to school and living with this old woman but quickly it started also to be impossible.</span> <span id="s299">I think somebody informed her, she said I could no longer stay with her without giving me clear reason.</span> <span id="s300">During this time,I think it was 1942, some children from ghetto were running the streets of Warsaw and begging for bread.</span> <span id="s301">You could see them on the street running in schmattas, very hungry mostly without hair.</span> <span id="s302">They had some kind of cans and they bang on these metal cans making noise and some, not all the people, are throwing food to these cans.</span> <span id="s303">It was in winter, 1941-42.</span> <span id="s304">The children were dying from hunger.</span> <span id="s305">When the Germans see them, they shoot them simply on the street.</span> <span id="s306">In this apartment building where I was living with this woman--she was going to work and I was back from school about 3:00 in the afternoon--it was a child sleeping on the stairs, with this big noisy can.</span> <span id="s307">He was banging on this can asking the people to throw some I throw some food, some bread, and he remember what I did and the next day he showed again.</span> <span id="s308">He was on my door, banging on this can.</span> <span id="s309">I don't know if you could understand my situation--how terribly dangerous it was to have a Jewish child at the door.</span> <span id="s310">I open the door and I again throw some food.</span> <span id="s311">I really didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s312">I was dying that the neighbors will open the door and then it would be a horrible situation for me.</span> <span id="s313">He came again and then he came again.</span> <span id="s314">But I was in fear of this poor child.</span> <span id="s315">I never had this kind of fear; I was sitting at home and almost praying to God not to send this child anymore, because I did not know what to do; open the door or not open the door.</span> <span id="s316">At this time me mother really didn't know what to do with me.</span> <span id="s317">Summer, 1942, started, my mother's friends found some friends near Lowicz.</span> <span id="s318">It was an agriculture school for the peasant girls and they sent me over there so I can help and work in the fields.</span> <span id="s319">They agreed to take me.</span> <span id="s320">That means that I would have a bed and food and then I can work.</span> <span id="s321">And I went there knowing that I don't have anyplace to go, nobody doesn't want to take me.</span> <span id="s322">I started to work and I was terribly unhappy, but I was unhappy all the time, it was nothing new.</span> <span id="s323">I was only one girl with dark hair between this Polish peasant, very simple girls sleeping in these big rooms with more than twenty beds.</span> <span id="s324">I had one bed between them and I was working in the fields or taking care of cows, garden, or taking out weeds.</span> <span id="s325">I learned a lot.</span> <span id="s326">The girls never suspected that I could be Jewish.</span> <span id="s327">They were simple and it was too far from their imagination.</span> <span id="s328">I was going with them to the church and they were surprised that I have different hobbies and different clothes.</span> <span id="s329">They asked me thousands of naive questions as what for I am reading books.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Where did you get books at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">They had some small library.</span> <span id="s332">It was very boring, as I knew almost everything, but you know, I still was reading in the evenings.</span> <span id="s333">I think the director of the school, he probably knew very well who am I, but they played they did not know.</span> <span id="s334">It was again some kind of denial.</span> <span id="s335">I had my documents and this time I had Kennkarte.</span> <span id="s336">As you can see, it was general agreement that I am not Jewish.</span> <span id="s337">I stayed there quite a long time.</span> <span id="s338">I didn't go back to Warsaw, I did not go back to school.</span> <span id="s339">It was not possible.</span> <span id="s340">I was working, I was very exhausted, very lonely, there was absolutely nobody to talk.</span> <span id="s341">I was still only 16.</span> <span id="s342">I got hepatitis and I was very sick.</span> <span id="s343">Of course, I was not seen by any physician.</span> <span id="s344">I was lying in bed with high fever, as yellow as lemon.</span> <span id="s345">After hepatitis, as I understand now, but not at this time, I had very deep depression.</span> <span id="s346">I was unable to do anything physically or mentally.</span> <span id="s347">I was sitting in the corner of the room and I was even unable to read.</span> <span id="s348">I was staring by window.</span> <span id="s349">I did not want anyone to talk to me and I didn't want to answer.</span> <span id="s350">It was for about three or four weeks and everybody was surprised what is going on.</span> <span id="s351">They think I am going crazy.</span> <span id="s352">After this time I went back to work.</span> <span id="s353">I was very weak and everybody was laughing because I cannot work too much.</span> <span id="s354">They told me I was lazy.</span> <span id="s355">Believe me, I wasn't lazy, I was sick.</span> <span id="s356">But I was dragging my foot.</span> <span id="s357">One of the girls in school got typhoid fever and they decided I was the best person to take care of her.</span> <span id="s358">They put us together in the small room.</span> <span id="s359">I had always some kind of nursing capability.</span> <span id="s360">I was interested in medicine.</span> <span id="s361">I was taking care of her and she was so sick that they took her in the hospital and she died.</span> <span id="s362">It was December 1942, yes it was December.</span> <span id="s363">I remember I was still not very healthy and I went to bring water from the well.</span> <span id="s364">It was a very windy day and I had long hair which I combed nicely back and put them together, but it was in the morning and my hair, I think, was down and it was windy and my hair was waving.</span> <span id="s365">Suddenly the car with Germans came to the school for something--they were coming frequently.</span> <span id="s366">I was always hiding someplace when I saw that the car is coming.</span> <span id="s367">And just as I was taking this water the car with the Germans came and they look at me and they immediately went to the director of the school and they asked him what this Jewish girl is doing here?</span> <span id="s368">So he said that I could not stay there any longer.</span> <span id="s369">'You have to go, you have to go now.'</span> <span id="s370">Some way, I don't remember how, I informed my mother, I had my mother's address, I don't remember.</span> <span id="s371">It was possible to call, probably, I don't know.</span> <span id="s372">My mother came next week and she picked me up and it was the end of my stay in this school.</span> <span id="s373">I went with her to Warsaw and I stayed with my very good friends.</span> <span id="s374">They were parents of my friend from school, Sophia Kielan, with whom I am still very friendly.</span> <span id="s375">I was good friends with both sisters, Zofia and Christina, and the parents agreed to take me to their home.</span> <span id="s376">It was just the beginning of 1943, and I started again to go to school.</span> <span id="s377">I tried to catch all that they learned during the last six months.</span> <span id="s378">For all my war time, it was probably the best time.</span> <span id="s379">I was treated as a third daughter.</span> <span id="s380">I think they like me and I treat them as my parents.</span> <span id="s381">Of course, they knew and I knew that they know.</span> <span id="s382">I had all my papers, I had documents, I had my Kennkarte, I have big beautiful picture of my first communion.</span> <span id="s383">It was very important that I have it.</span> <span id="s384">I stayed with them until May 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Does that mean after ghetto uprising?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Yes.</span> <span id="s387">The time was very difficult for the Jews.</span> <span id="s388">It was plenty of informers.</span> <span id="s389">It was very difficult to be on the street.</span> <span id="s390">Many times they stop me; still sometimes I had to go to downtown Warsaw.</span> <span id="s391">I had to pretend that I was a 'normal person'; that I am moving around as everybody else.</span> <span id="s392">I didn't mention before--but I cannot talk about everything at the same time--I was in the Polish underground movement, from age 14 or 15.</span> <span id="s393">I was involved with my friends, Sophia and Christine Kielan.</span> <span id="s394">I was in Polish underground army youth organization, which was Szare Szeregi, grey tows.</span> <span id="s395">We had our meetings and we had some underground activities.</span> <span id="s396">It was a danger, but for me it was also some kind of protection.</span> <span id="s397">I don't know if you understand why.</span> <span id="s398">Unfortunately, I did not only fear the Germans, I fear, above all, the Poles.</span> <span id="s399">The Germans were not dangerous for me directly; indirectly, yes.</span> <span id="s400">But directly it was the Poles, somebody on the street, or ex-friends, or someone who knew who was my father, or they stopped me because they recognized me, or some neighbors, or concierge.</span> <span id="s401">Being in the Polish underground movement created some kind of protection.</span> <span id="s402">I am with Polish youth, I am in the underground movement and cannot be Jewish.</span> <span id="s403">We had our meetings; we had small different tasks.</span> <span id="s404">I remember they gave me a Polish underground newspaper called Biuletyn Informacyjny.</span> <span id="s405">They gave me a bunch of them, I don't know, twenty or more and they asked me to deliver to different houses.</span> <span id="s406">It was what the young people were doing.</span> <span id="s407">I didn't want to take it; I didn't want to take it not because I didn't want to, but my danger was my face.</span> <span id="s408">I didn't want because if they pick me up with the underground materials who knows what I will tell if they will start to beat me up.</span> <span id="s409">But I didn't want to tell them that I didn't want to take it.</span> <span id="s410">Everybody will be thinking, why not?</span> <span id="s411">Of course, it was out of the questions to tell them--what was most simply--"Look at me.</span> <span id="s412">Do you really want me to walk on the street with this kind of look with underground material?"</span> <span id="s413">So you can see it was constant struggle how to avoid this kind of involvement.</span> <span id="s414">I remember one other scene.</span> <span id="s415">I was going to school with my friend, Sophia, and her mother gave us some small lunch with us, piece of bread, we had in the pocket.</span> <span id="s416">We walk.</span> <span id="s417">It was not very far from the home and there was a Jewish child sitting with a can, this completely emaciated child sitting with this can and banging, half dead looking.</span> <span id="s418">We both took our lunch from our pocket and throw away to his can.</span> <span id="s419">This Polish woman noticed it and started to run after us screaming "You dirty Jewish helpers."</span> <span id="s420">She was very angry that we gave this piece of bread to the Jewish child.</span> <span id="s421">Now let's talk about the Jewish uprising.</span> <span id="s422">The uprising started just before Easter.</span> <span id="s423">I think it started on Thursday and from the place that we were living--it was fifth floor, the window faced to the south--we could see the flames and even when it was quiet at night, it was no street movement, you can hear people screaming.</span> <span id="s424">And then, of course, smoke, and constant guns shot.</span> <span id="s425">We all tried not to go near the ghetto.</span> <span id="s426">It was very dangerous at this times, as was many times described.</span> <span id="s427">And then I remember a few days after the ghetto uprising started, it was Easter breakfast in the house of our friends.</span> <span id="s428">I think they have a hard time with me too, because all the relatives started to tell them--why do you keep this strange- looking girl; we are sure she is Jewish, and so on and so on.</span> <span id="s429">But it was a big breakfast and the relatives and friends were invited and we were sitting at the table and eating and the windows are open and you can see the smoke and hear the guns.</span> <span id="s430">It was hard for me to take it.</span> <span id="s431">It was some feelings that I am not in the right place, that probably I should be over there, not here.</span> <span id="s432">And some of these people sitting in the room, I remember, saying, 'Good that the Germans are doing for us the dirty work.'</span> <span id="s433">It is a poem by Czestaw Mitosz, do you know Campo dei Fiori?</span> <span id="s434">As I told you it was not good to go near the ghetto at this time, but I went once or twice and I remember that on the Platz Krasinski, it was a small some kind of carnival.</span> <span id="s435">It was music and the people are going on the carousel and it was beautiful weather and it was the wall of ghetto, and shooting and smoke and screaming, and here people were playing.</span> <span id="s436">It was described in Mitosz poem and it was this way as he described.</span> <span id="s437">Czestaw Mitosz: Compo dei Fiori.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">...The bright melody drowned the salvos from the ghetto wall, and couples were flying high in the cloudless sky.</span> <span id="s439">At times wind from the burning would drift dark kites along and riders on the carousel caught petals in mid-air...</span></p> <p><span id="s440">You want to hear what happens to me later.</span> <span id="s441">I finish school at this time, I finish gymnasium, and we had some kind of examination and matura.</span> <span id="s442">I do not go into detail because it has nothing to do with my personal story, Jewish story.</span> <span id="s443">Gymnasium was not existing during the war and we had what they call komplety.</span> <span id="s444">It was an underground school and we move from one house to another and teachers were coming and this way I finished gymnasium, with small groups of other girls and in May, 1943 we had to take matura, high school diploma exam.</span> <span id="s445">Both my friends went to underground university which was also active during the war in Warsaw, and I decided to go to the school for nurses.</span> <span id="s446">At this time I knew that I want to be a physician.</span> <span id="s447">So I decided to go to school for nurses.</span> <span id="s448">It was a very good school in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s449">It was run by a woman, Mrs. Romanowski; I remember her.</span> <span id="s450">And she decided to take me even though I was below the age.</span> <span id="s451">You have to be 17 to be admitted and I was sixteen and a half.</span> <span id="s452">She agreed to take me as a student.</span> <span id="s453">We were working in the hospital in the morning and in the afternoon we had lessons.</span> <span id="s454">It was a dormitory on the last floor; one room for four girls and we were able to live there--also very poor food, but at least it was something to eat.</span> <span id="s455">This way I was all set, I can tell, because I was able to stay there.</span> <span id="s456">Also it was safer because I had a nurse uniform with some kind of a white hat and I feel that I did not look so different in this.</span> <span id="s457">My hair was pulled back; my uniform was all white and I was always careful to be extremely clean and in order.</span> <span id="s458">You know it was very important not to look neglected.</span> <span id="s459">What was very strange, the directress of the school, I think, she knew very well who am I. I think some people called her and ask her to take me.</span> <span id="s460">At first she agreed to take me even though I was below the age.</span> <span id="s461">And second, every new pupil has some kind of task to do in school.</span> <span id="s462">For instance, keep the bathrooms clean or keep the corridors clean or clean the table after breakfast.</span> <span id="s463">They gave me a chapel.</span> <span id="s464">I was in charge of chapel.</span> <span id="s465">What was not so very easy because I had to get up very early, 5:30 in the morning, and clean the chapel and put the flowers and then help the priest with Mass.</span> <span id="s466">After Mass, you don't know this because it is completely different now, the priest was going to give Communion to the sick people in the hospital.</span> <span id="s467">And I was the one going before the priest with a candle and a small bell making noise and to show him who wanted to have Communion.</span> <span id="s468">That was my task for every day morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Where was your mother at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s470">My mother was working for some people with problems.</span> <span id="s471">I remember, in one house, the woman had cancer and she had small children and my mother was helping.</span> <span id="s472">She never had any specific problem as a Jewish woman.</span> <span id="s473">We had also other problems: we didn't have any money, we didn't have an apartment.</span> <span id="s474">My brother stayed in the orphanage.</span> <span id="s475">He had problems because he looked too dark; he had curly, dark hair.</span> <span id="s476">At this time, I think he knew that he was not circumcised and he knew that he can prove he is not Jewish.</span> <span id="s477">I stayed in the nurses' school until 1944, when it starts the Warsaw uprising.</span> <span id="s478">I was still in the Polish underground movement and still had to take some orders from them--we were soldiers.</span> <span id="s479">So, when Warsaw uprising started I had to go to my unit; I was two months in the army.</span> <span id="s480">I was useful after one year's nursing school.</span> <span id="s481">I was with a paramedics group; it was four or five girls in this group.</span> <span id="s482">We stayed two months together, being almost killed many, many times, but at this time, at least, I was no different than the other people; we were all fighting with Germans.</span> <span id="s483">But it was not also so easy, I remember when the Polish soldiers from uprising were leaving Stare Miasto and going through sewerage and they are taking them in the night through the openings in the street.</span> <span id="s484">One of the girls told me later that when they were taking her out--she had very black hair like I had but I don't think she was Jewish--one of the people helping her said, "Why should we help you, you are Jewish", and pushed her away.</span> <span id="s485">Of course other people said, "No, no, she is with us."</span> <span id="s486">But mostly at this time it was not important how do you look, everyday we could be killed, not once, but many times.</span> <span id="s487">The uprising finished in end of September 1944, and we were taken to a camp, to Pruszkow.</span> <span id="s488">It was a big camp and most of the people were taken to Germany.</span> <span id="s489">We went with my friend Sophia and her mother from Warsaw to Pruszkow.</span> <span id="s490">Then we were taken to the train; the train was going very slowly through the station and we jumped from the train.</span> <span id="s491">The train was open, they didn't have a roof, if somebody helped you, you could jump over.</span> <span id="s492">Then I stayed with them in their friend's house.</span> <span id="s493">I was very sick, I had pneumonia.</span> <span id="s494">We all had louse, we were very dirty, probably not eating for many days.</span> <span id="s495">Even I don't remember, I think I was not completely conscious.</span> <span id="s496">The people were very nice, they gave us baths and clean clothes.</span> <span id="s497">Our clothes were only to be burned; they were so dirty and louse-infested.</span> <span id="s498">I have some kind of foggy memory of this place.</span> <span id="s499">I stayed through October, 1944, and in November, my mother find that I survived, and she survived and my brother survived.</span> <span id="s500">They were in a completely other part of the town; we did not know about each other for more than three months.</span> <span id="s501">My mother came and she took me away to some big house for displaced persons from Warsaw, near Krakov.</span> <span id="s502">It was terribly dirty place and we were happy if we had one small bed for two people.</span> <span id="s503">Everybody sleeps two people on one bed, or if it was worse, three people on the bed.</span> <span id="s504">We were very hungry, there was a small amount of food and the people were very unpleasant for us.</span> <span id="s505">And on the end of November, I went to Krakov myself and I found myself a job in a small chronic hospital for old and displaced people.</span> <span id="s506">They were very short with any help and they took me immediately when I told them I finished one year of nursing school.</span> <span id="s507">It was the most terrible place that I ever worked, but at least I was able to survive.</span> <span id="s508">I was living in a small room with another woman and they gave us some food twice a day, and we knew the war would finish soon.</span> <span id="s509">And war finished for us, in January 1945.</span> <span id="s510">I was working over there for two months.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Who liberated you?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">The Soviets, of course.</span> <span id="s513">The war finished and immediately when the university opened in Krakov, I wanted to go to Medical School in Krakov, I was not admitted.</span> <span id="s514">They told me that I didn't finish high school.</span> <span id="s515">I had some small proof of my final exams but they said it was not enough.</span> <span id="s516">In fall, 1945, I moved from Krakov with my mother and my brother to Ntoctaw--Breslau in Silesia.</span> <span id="s517">It was an easy town for some reason--it was easy to have an apartment.</span> <span id="s518">The town was destroyed, but still there were some good houses.</span> <span id="s519">The Germans were sent to Germany as displaced persons.</span> <span id="s520">And we got some nice apartment and I was admitted to medical school and my brother went to gymnasium and my mother got a job as a librarian in the Polytechnical School in Ntoctaw.</span> <span id="s521">So we started some kind of normal life.</span> <span id="s522">We were very poor, of course.</span> <span id="s523">My mother's salary was very low and it was difficult for us to live.</span> <span id="s524">I had some strange jobs during my years at medical school, trying to make a little money.</span> <span id="s525">My father was helping a little--my father was in England sending some parcels, sometimes with food and sometimes with something what we could sell.</span> <span id="s526">And this way we survived and I finished medical school and I stayed in Poland.</span> <span id="s527">I was married, I had children and I left Poland in 1971.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">I want to thank you very much for your very candid...</span></p> <p><span id="s529">But I think I should add, I almost feel obligated to add what has happened to other members of my family.</span> <span id="s530">The family on my father's side, they mostly converted before the war and nobody, or almost nobody went to ghetto.</span> <span id="s531">They stayed on the Polish side and they had a very difficult time.</span> <span id="s532">They were wealthy and if you had money, of course it was easier to survive.</span> <span id="s533">But, also, you were under constant attention of informers that are coming to the house and telling, "Well, give us some money, you Jew, give us some money.</span> <span id="s534">If not we will go to the Gestapo and the police."</span> <span id="s535">We were so poor and it was so obvious that we don't have any money that the informers did not pay much attention to us because we were not attractive for them.</span> <span id="s536">So one of my aunts always said we survived the war because you were too poor to be of interest for anybody.</span> <span id="s537">And, some of them survived and some of them they were given by informers to police and Gestapo and they were killed.</span> <span id="s538">In my mother's family, almost everyone was killed.</span> <span id="s539">They never converted, they were Jewish and everybody knew they were Jewish.</span> <span id="s540">They never changed their name--their name was Dajches and they all perished in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s541">I gathered all the names for Yad Vashem.</span> <span id="s542">It was more than twenty people.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">I'm sorry to hear that.</span> <span id="s544">Is there anything else you would like to add, any episodes you didn't recount to me, or anything else you would like to say to me at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s545">I think only that it can be said much better than I did.</span> <span id="s546">I try to keep on facts.</span> <span id="s547">I think, basically, that's all.</span> <span id="s548">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">NOTE: At the request of Dr. Prot, corrections (both additions and deletions) were made in the original transcript.</span> <span id="s550">This copy includes those
