Good morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Answer: Good morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: I wonder if we can begin with you just stating your name and telling us whether or not you ever spelled it differently?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s19">My name is Stefan Czyzewski and I never spelled it differently, except for duration of 1941 to ‘45, I carried a different last name and I was a-at that time, I was Stefan Grot, G-r-o-t.</span> <span id="s20">And reason for change, that none of us in the -- in my fighting group carried his own name.</span> <span id="s21">In most cases, we just had one word pseudonym -- pseudoname.</span> <span id="s22">In my case, I carried a full name, but my last name was different from the original.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: Before we get to your work in your fighting group in your resistance, during the war, I’ve heard that your father hid a Jewish family, or hid Jews and I wonder if you can tell us that?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: Yes, we -- my father hid a friend, whose name was Ithzac Visipka and his two children.</span> <span id="s25">One was about eight, one was about 11, a boy and a girl.</span> <span id="s26">And the tragedy of my father’s life was that they were killed, very close to the end of the war.</span> <span id="s27">During one of the pacifications, Mr. Visipka just couldn’t stand it, sitting in hiding, so he took off and ran and was caught in a field -- in open field by pacification squad, the German SS group and he was killed and his children were killed.</span> <span id="s28">And the bad part of it is, too, that they were shot only once and wer -- they were dying for a long, long time.</span> <span id="s29">They refused to shoot them second time.</span> <span id="s30">And of course, later on, they came and took my father.</span> <span id="s31">Somebody apparently reported and my father, he had to dig a grave for them and bury them.</span> <span id="s32">And they also were going to shoot my father -- father, with them, but my father was a foxy old man, so before he went there, he went into a closet, he pulled ours -- out his Isen cross that the Germans gave him in the first World War, pinned it up on his jacket and dug the hole.</span> <span id="s33">After he buried this -- I mean, after he laid these people in, he even put his jacket over their faces.</span> <span id="s34">And they said, “Now it’s your turn.”</span> <span id="s35">So he turned around and said, “Do you want to kill a German hero?”</span> <span id="s36">So they looked, and he had a -- his citation with him, in his pocket.</span> <span id="s37">They read the citation and said, “Old man, you escaped this time.</span> <span id="s38">Don’t let that happen again.”</span> <span id="s39">And they let him go.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: Can you tell us how your father came to hide them?</span> <span id="s41">What were the circumstances that led to this?</span> <span id="s42">Did -- did they --</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: Was very -- very simple.</span> <span id="s44">Everybody -- just about everybody I knew was hiding a Jewish person or two or three.</span> <span id="s45">Just about everybody in our -- in our village -- in our village of 52 household, we had probably 20 or 30 Jewish people being hidden.</span> <span id="s46">Some survived, some did not.</span> <span id="s47">One person that we hid, did survive.</span> <span id="s48">She was a young Jewish woman and she did survive.</span> <span id="s49">Later on she served in the Polish government.</span> <span id="s50">I don’t -- I know her name was Maria, but I don’t re -- know her -- never knew her last name.</span> <span id="s51">She was a friend of Mr. Jebbe, who was a tailor, who was also with us for some time, but he was killed during one of the pacifications.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: So this hiding occurred in Leshganorra, your village?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: Leshnagorra, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: Do you know when it began, the hiding of th-the father and the two children?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: It began in late 1941, when the ghettos were established.</span> <span id="s56">Mr. Visipka’s wife decided not to go in hiding.</span> <span id="s57">She decided to go to the ghe -- stay in ghetto and she even decided to go to the Warsaw ghetto, where she perished, apparently.</span> <span id="s58">But Mr. Visipka did not want to stay in ghetto, since he was used to roaming the villages.</span> <span id="s59">Before the war, he carried bundle for his mother, Golda, who was a peddler and he knew everybody and everybody knew Mr. Visipka.</span> <span id="s60">So he thought that he would survive among the Polish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: Do you know if he came to your father and asked him, or if your father offered?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: I don’t think he ever asked.</span> <span id="s63">He came one night and father -- he -- we talk and he -- father and he talked and father found him a place to hide and when I came back from the Middle East, in fall of 1941, I made Mr. Visipka a good hiding place.</span> <span id="s64">And he stayed there forever and a day.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: So you made the hiding place?</span> <span id="s66">How did you do it, tell us?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: There was an big attic, huge, huge attic above the cow barn.</span> <span id="s68">And the attic was full of straw, bundles of straw.</span> <span id="s69">So, I made a little trap door in a ceiling of the barn and I made a chamber among the straw above that trap door.</span> <span id="s70">It was nice and warm.</span> <span id="s71">It was stinky, of course, but who cared about stink at that time?</span> <span id="s72">And Mr. Visipka stayed there, on and off.</span> <span id="s73">He would go places.</span> <span id="s74">He -- we would go to work in a field for some of the farmers who had so-called farms on outskirts.</span> <span id="s75">He could not work on our farm, because our farm was within a village and too many people would have seen him.</span> <span id="s76">So he went to work for people who -- who were all alone somewhere on the side of -- on the edge of the forest.</span> <span id="s77">And he would stay and work with them.</span> <span id="s78">Then they will come back, he will get -- bring some food.</span> <span id="s79">And of course, food was never short in our place, so he didn’t have to worry about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: Were you there when he was discovered and killed?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: No, I was not.</span> <span id="s82">I was with my fighting unit.</span> <span id="s83">But I heard story after I came back.</span> <span id="s84">My father wouldn’t talk, but some people talked.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: You father wouldn’t talk about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: No.</span> <span id="s87">He felt very bad about it.</span> <span id="s88">And we had a -- we had all kind of moments.</span> <span id="s89">Funny moments, laughing moments, was horribly scared.</span> <span id="s90">We were worrying.</span> <span id="s91">There was one moment -- we were notified by somebody who knew about the pacification squad coming in, so we told Mr. Visipka, “Get in and stay there and don’t peek out.”</span> <span id="s92">Well, Mr. Visipka left his children.</span> <span id="s93">He couldn’t stand it, he ran away.</span> <span id="s94">Later on he said, “I didn’t want to be found and have all of you killed.”</span> <span id="s95">So he came back next -- next day, wet, muddy, cold.</span> <span id="s96">And he said, “No panyan.</span> <span id="s97">I had three lucks.</span> <span id="s98">The first luck was the German didn’t kill me.</span> <span id="s99">The second luck wa -- luck was, your dog didn’t eat me.”</span> <span id="s100">We had a big, big dog.</span> <span id="s101">“And the third luck was, I didn’t drown in the mud.”</span> <span id="s102">He ran into the forest, just about 200 feet from our barn and hid in the mud there.</span> <span id="s103">He said, “The third -- third luck was, I did not drown in the mud.”</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: An-and -- and the woman, Maria, who stayed with you, was she staying at the same time and where was she staying?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: She was staying just about the same time and even before and after.</span> <span id="s106">She did not stay with us permanently, but she would come and stay for a week or two and then she would go her own way.</span> <span id="s107">We didn’t want to know where she went and she didn’t want to tell us where she went.</span> <span id="s108">She apparently had many places to stay.</span> <span id="s109">And after the war, she worked for the Secretary of the Interior, Mr. Minz, in the Polish government.</span> <span id="s110">And she was twice, I think, instrumental in saving my father from the Communists.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: What do you -- what do you know about that?</span> <span id="s112">Can you tell us anything about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: I didn’t know very much, because I wasn’t there, but later on my sister brought me there.</span> <span id="s114">They wanted my father to join the collective and he said, “Damn you, forget it.”</span> <span id="s115">So, they had a local Communist who was forcing and encouraging everybody to join the collective, give the farm away.</span> <span id="s116">So my father went and threaten him, so they ha-had him arrested and beat him up and of course, Maria came and saved him.</span> <span id="s117">And a couple weeks later, somebody went out at night and shot up the house of the person who was forcing everybody into it, and I know who that was.</span> <span id="s118">My father was a [indecipherable] was short-tempered.</span> <span id="s119">He has a gun, he had a machine gun.</span> <span id="s120">He could do almost anything, within reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: Your father did that?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: Yes, of course.</span> <span id="s123">Of course, he was arrested immediately after that.</span> <span id="s124">But he was released and the police -- for their pains, the local militia almost got executed by the Soviet general.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: Why did they almost get executed?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: Well, during the war, there was a dirty old -- dirty old, well, he was -- looked old, he was in his probably late 20’s or early 30’s -- Russian hiding with us for man -- I mean, for weeks and months, at times.</span> <span id="s127">And my father spoke Russian very well, because he served in south imperial army, and they became friends, and that Ivan, as we called him, came and went.</span> <span id="s128">After the war, we discovered that he led all the Communist partisans in our territory and he was sa -- and he was a general in charge of an Russian pantzer division in a town of Minsk, which was about 10 - 15 miles from our farm.</span> <span id="s129">So, when my father was arrested second time, my sister went and tried to talk to the man in charge in Minsk.</span> <span id="s130">And of course, they wouldn’t let her talk to him, but eventually she prevailed.</span> <span id="s131">She just sat down and wouldn’t move and talked to Ivan Ivanovitch.</span> <span id="s132">I don’t know if it was his real name or not.</span> <span id="s133">He came storming in, in an army car with two soldiers and a -- and a driver and he came to the county village.</span> <span id="s134">He took the police, put them against the wall and ta -- got my father out of jail and said, “Yanna, do you want to shoot those son of a bitches?”</span> <span id="s135">And father said, “Oh, no, they do their work.</span> <span id="s136">But they beat me up, so I want to hit them few times.”</span> <span id="s137">So, he hit them few times.</span> <span id="s138">And they were warned, they were told, “If you ever happen -- anything happens to John ever, I’ll come and shoot you, you [indecipherable] and so and so.”</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: So there was a lot going on at your house.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: Well, of course.</span> <span id="s141">We had a lively life.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: I-It was -- it seems that it was a safe house for at least two Jewish families -- well, one family, one woman, and then a Communist partisan, who happened to turn out to be an important leader?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: Yes, it was.</span> <span id="s144">Of course, there were other people who came in and out, hiding.</span> <span id="s145">People from the Polish underground, some of my boys who were hurt, who were shot, stayed for a few days, couple weeks.</span> <span id="s146">As you -- as I mentioned previously, I think my mother -- my mother, my grandmother, was a witch doctor.</span> <span id="s147">She had weeds, she -- she -- she had herbs, she had all kind of stuff and she could cure almost anybody out of anything.</span> <span id="s148">She couldn’t grow legs or arms, but she could do almost anything else.</span> <span id="s149">So we had many wounded partisans come and stay and hide.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: So, if something happened in your fighting group and someone was injured, you would e -- you might take them to your house or tell them how to get there?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: Yes, we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: And then where would they actually stay, in the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: Oh, we had a small closet, we had a kind of a storeroom.</span> <span id="s154">Course we had a barn with all kind of hid-hid-hiding places, they could stay there, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: And the word never got around that this house of the Czyzewski’s was a house where there were many partisans in and out and --</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: Well, the wor --</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: Jews hiding and --</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: -- the words got around and we had many visits from the Schultz Politsi, even people from the Einsatzgruppen came to visit few times.</span> <span id="s159">They beat my father, occasionally.</span> <span id="s160">But never shot -- never killed him.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: Did your father or your sisters ever talk about feeling afraid during this times?</span> <span id="s162">A: Yes, they were.</span> <span id="s163">They were shitty scared at times.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: How did they tell you that?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: Oh yes, we’re afraid, we shook.</span> <span id="s166">We cried, we yelled a lot wh-when they hit us.</span> <span id="s167">So they just left us alone and went away.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: Your sisters were hit, also?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: My sisters were hit also, especially my younger sister, who would te -- who would -- who was outspoken.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: I’d like to turn now, to fill in some gaps, turn now to your training as a -- as an underground fighter.</span> <span id="s171">And I’m talking about the period -- the six month period where you left Siberia and then you walked in to Iran.</span> <span id="s172">And I’m wondering if we could talk a little bit about that.</span> <span id="s173">What did the camp actually look like when you finally got there?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: It was a tent city, close to Teheran, out in the desert.</span> <span id="s175">There was cold at night, there was hot during the day.</span> <span id="s176">The hamsen blew occasionally.</span> <span id="s177">The sto -- sandstorm blew occasionally.</span> <span id="s178">And the British fished out a small group of people and since my whole life practically went by seventeens, there were 17 young Polish boys and there was a British -- Commander Thompson, we called him.</span> <span id="s179">He went -- he ran the guts out of us.</span> <span id="s180">We went on long marches, with heavy loads.</span> <span id="s181">We went infiltrate and exfiltrating from objects -- military objects -- camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: What do you mean by that, infiltrating?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: Sneaking in and sneaking out, without being caught.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: For instance, how would he have you do that, in a training exercise?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: We would burrow under the wires.</span> <span id="s186">The camp had wi -- barbed wire round.</span> <span id="s187">We would get in, we would steal things to te -- to s -- to tell that we were in.</span> <span id="s188">And the camp guards, who had put an especial -- they were receive special efforts that somebody is going to infiltrate here and we were caught couple times, but we were caught about twi -- two out of 10 times.</span> <span id="s189">Most of the time we were lucky to get in and get out without being caught.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: So you would be outside the camp and you would have a mission to sneak in, steal something and sneak back out?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s192">And at times we just went in carrying nothing and times we came -- we went in carrying arms.</span> <span id="s193">At times we went in carrying heavy loads, in preparation for later times, when we had to carry explosives, things.</span> <span id="s194">And we went on long marches, we went on a -- we took in a -- took part in a firefights.</span> <span id="s195">We took part in firefights being surrounded by superior forces.</span> <span id="s196">And that really helped us later on, when I came back to Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: What -- what strategies were you learning in those exercises?</span> <span id="s198">What do you do when you’re surrounded by superior forces?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: You divide your group in two or three subgroups.</span> <span id="s200">And one groups opens heavy fire when the -- the other group proceeds ahead of it.</span> <span id="s201">Then this -- then the group that went ahead of you opens heavy fire and you catch up with it.</span> <span id="s202">And then in -- both of you open heavy fire in every direction when the third lit -- group comes to you.</span> <span id="s203">And for a time we made efforts not to get surrounded by the Einsatzgruppen that we went to fight.</span> <span id="s204">Later on, when we -- when we received our good armament, especially after we bought whole lot of -- after we bought a whole lot of Schmizers from a German supply officers, were so heavily armed, that the Germans had no chance with us, whatsoever.</span> <span id="s205">As I mentioned in my previous interview, the 75 to 120 people in a German Einsatzgruppen would have four automatic weapons and rest would be manual rifles.</span> <span id="s206">My group of 17 plus two, carried 27 Schmizers, because 10 of my boys did not trust the damn German weapon, they wanted to have two.</span> <span id="s207">So, we had a su-surplus of it, so each of them carried two.</span> <span id="s208">And we had such a enormous firepower that he, on purpose wanted to be surrounded so we could get into fire -- a real firefight and get out of it and well, knock out more people than we normally would have.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: In the training sessions though, what kind of ammunition were you firing?</span> <span id="s210">Was it live or blank?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: We always used live ammunition.</span> <span id="s212">Work it -- were -- were wounded sometime, but it was realistic, we always used live ammunition.</span> <span id="s213">If you stuck your neck -- head too far, you got hit.</span> <span id="s214">So you don’t.</span> <span id="s215">You keep your head down.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: Did anyone ever get killed in training?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s218">I’m -- I don’t want to talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: You mentioned that when you first got there, there was a period of indoctrination, psychological or philosophical.</span> <span id="s220">What -- what -- what were you learning in that period --</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: Was it in --</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: -- from the British?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: -- in a Soviet camp, or in --</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: Not in the Soviet camp --</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: -- in British.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: -- in the British camp, when you were being indoctrinated to become an underground fighter.</span> <span id="s227">What was the philosophy that you were being taught?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: Well the -- first of all, the British wanted to re-brainwash us after we had been brainwashed by the Communists, which didn’t take very long.</span> <span id="s229">And later on, we had British and we had Polish office -- political officers coming and talking to us, invoking great Polish patriotism, which was unnecessary.</span> <span id="s230">We were too patriotic as it was.</span> <span id="s231">As a matter of fact, we were chauvinistic.</span> <span id="s232">But mostly it was the philosophy of hitting back, philosophy of saving people.</span> <span id="s233">Philosophy of making the Europe free of the Nazi scourge.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: And was there any talk in this indoctrination period of what -- of what else you were fighting for?</span> <span id="s235">What was the end goal in terms of Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: The end goal of -- was a free -- or free Poland.</span> <span id="s237">Independent, free Poland.</span> <span id="s238">It turned otherwise, but we really wanted to fight for the free, independent Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: And wa -- was the training camp allied with any of the underground movements?</span> <span id="s240">In other words, you were training in -- in Iran.</span> <span id="s241">Were they telling you, we want you to connect, when you get back to Poland, with one of these specific underground armies?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: It was suggested, but it was not told to.</span> <span id="s243">When we came back, the most powerful group was the ZWZ and we joined it for a time.</span> <span id="s244">Then, that was evolving into the home army, the AK.</span> <span id="s245">And also in the NSZ, the nationals armed forces.</span> <span id="s246">So some of us -- some of us were given groups of fighters from either AK or NSZ and in my case, my sympathies were with -- were with NSZ and they gave me -- supplied me with some ammunitions, some arms, some explosives and gave me 17 people, plus two.</span> <span id="s247">That was that ti --</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: You were going to say, I think you were saying it was a right wing?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: It was a right wing Polish underground.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: And I want to talk more about that, but I just want to get clear on one thing.</span> <span id="s251">When you say that it was suggested that you make a connection to a certain group, what -- what were your leaders in the British training camp?</span> <span id="s252">Which group were they guiding you towards?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: The -- not the British, but the Polish political officers were guiding us toward the present and the future home army, because the home army was under jurisdiction of the Polish government in exile in Great Britain.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: And how would they suggest?</span> <span id="s255">What would they say?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: Well, they would -- they would talk a lot about it.</span> <span id="s257">This is probably the best middle of the way group.</span> <span id="s258">They don’t discriminate against anybody and they don’t fight -- fight any other group, they even tolerate the Socialist, Communists.</span> <span id="s259">And this is probably the future of Poland, we will have to live with that, Soviet Russia.</span> <span id="s260">And this probab -- this government probably will be the most likely to survive and continue.</span> <span id="s261">And we were told -- also told -- we were warned against my future, NSZ, those people have no future because the Soviet Russia will never allow it -- them to exist.</span> <span id="s262">But, of course, if you are 17 and 18, you don’t believe it, you are omnipotent.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning of Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Muse-Museum interview with Stefan Czyzewski and this is tape number one, side B.</span> <span id="s265">If you could just tell us a little bit more about your personal allegiance to the underground group that -- that you chose, the NSZ?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: They just happens -- happened almost by happenstance.</span> <span id="s267">They were in ma -- in a neighborhood where I was.</span> <span id="s268">I was available, they were receptive.</span> <span id="s269">The AK, the army akaioba already had a group like mine from that neighborhood.</span> <span id="s270">They took one of my friends who came with me, as a leader.</span> <span id="s271">And the NSZ people had better armament that they could provide us with and also they were very much against the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s272">They hated the damn Communists.</span> <span id="s273">And of course, after spe -- having spent a year in a Soviet prison camp, I didn’t like them much either.</span> <span id="s274">So, that was probably kind of a combination of reasons why I did join the NSZ.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: And as you’ve described and y-y-you described them sometimes as right wing and in fact, in some cases, they were known for being very anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s276">What were your thoughts about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: That was probably the only aspect that I didn’t cherish.</span> <span id="s278">Also, in my very neighborhood, in my very group, we were not.</span> <span id="s279">As I previously mentioned, I had two people in my group who survived the whole schmier.</span> <span id="s280">Out of the four, who are left out of the 20, two of them were Jewish boys.</span> <span id="s281">Isaac One and Isaac Two.</span> <span id="s282">And we had -- I have known another probably half a dozen Jewish young men who were in a group.</span> <span id="s283">Some even were in a command.</span> <span id="s284">So even though the NSZ was at times quite anti-Semitic, everybody had a Jew he liked.</span> <span id="s285">And he wou -- whom he would protect and save and wanted him to come and fight with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: Tell us, how did the group express it’s anti-Semitism, if in fact, sometimes Jews were in the group?</span> <span id="s287">How was it expressed, the anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: In most cases -- in my group, we never talked about it.</span> <span id="s289">We -- our talk was always how to hit the da-damn -- damn Germans and hora and whit and how to be most effective.</span> <span id="s290">And my two Jewish boys had con -- had connection with people in a ghetto -- in neighboring ghettos in two or three towns and had some conva -- kind of a uncanny ability or foresight.</span> <span id="s291">If we wanted sometime to go one way, they would -- one of them would say, “Walcheem, no we don’t want to go that way, we want to go around.”</span> <span id="s292">So we went around and we discovered later on if we went that way, we would have gotten knocked out.</span> <span id="s293">So it was more on a personal level than on a ideological level.</span> <span id="s294">They trusted you, you trusted them.</span> <span id="s295">And sometime you trusted them more than you tru-trusted your -- your -- your own Polack in your group.</span> <span id="s296">It was mostly personal and we hardly ever talked ideology during our fights, during our existence -- throughout our existence.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: I want to go back a little bit, to the training camp.</span> <span id="s298">You have told us about how you learned how to infiltrate.</span> <span id="s299">How did you learn how to -- for instance, to do certain acts of sabotage, how did you practice them?</span> <span id="s300">Perhaps derailing a train, if you could explain to us how they gave you that training?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: The sabotage part of it was probably the most extens-extensive and took the longest time.</span> <span id="s302">They taught us techniques -- how to use old dynamite, which was the only explosive that we could fi -- get in Poland for a long, long time.</span> <span id="s303">And how to build that plate -- carry and put metal plate on the -- under the explosives, under the rail.</span> <span id="s304">They taught us, if they -- we did not have explosives, they tol -- they trained us how to loosen up a rail to detrain a train.</span> <span id="s305">But in most cases, the most effective would have been explosives.</span> <span id="s306">They told us how to use batteries and since we did not have good equipment, we -- you just hung up to two little wires in your hand.</span> <span id="s307">Your hand shook and you wondered if y -- if you are going to blow the damn thing on time or after the train went by, which sometime it happened.</span> <span id="s308">My commander was mad at me at ev -- every time I missed that thing, he wanted to court martial and we -- he threatened to put me against the wall and shoot me if I missed.</span> <span id="s309">But of course, later on he told me, “I would never shoot you, because you are useful.</span> <span id="s310">You are a good tool.”</span> <span id="s311">Well, I don’t know if I was a good tool or not, but I tried my darnest.</span> <span id="s312">They told us how to attach explosive to doors or to gates or to the brick wall.</span> <span id="s313">How to remove a brick from a brick wall, surrounding an object or how to dig out quickly, break out of a brick building and put explosives in it.</span> <span id="s314">And how to stretch the wire, how to use -- how to use fuse.</span> <span id="s315">How long each fuse would burn -- how many feet per minute it would burn.</span> <span id="s316">How many meters per a minute it would burn.</span> <span id="s317">How far you had to be from an objective if you blow it up.</span> <span id="s318">Which side of the object you were blowing up, you were supposed to be on, if possible.</span> <span id="s319">If it’s not possible, how to hide, what to hide in, how to best hide.</span> <span id="s320">The best pla -- best place to hide was to dig a foxhole.</span> <span id="s321">You didn’t have time to dig the foxhole, so you hi -- you were kind of in a halfway quandary and great excitement and being scared and being perplexed.</span> <span id="s322">And strange enough, I can’t believe it, but most of the times, perhaps seven out of 10, maybe eight, sometime nine out of 10, we were lucky and effective.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: Were you often, when you did go through with an action and blow something up, were you often within hearing distance of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: We were always within hearing distance.</span> <span id="s325">Sometime we were within -- within a harm distance of it, except that if you put yourself behind a big stone or in a small ditch or behind another wall, you were not harmed.</span> <span id="s326">But sometime you were.</span> <span id="s327">I had bricks -- brick wall fall on me.</span> <span id="s328">The object was probably 200 feet from where I was, that blown up and I was hiding behind a good brick wall that turned out not to be a great brick wall, because if fell apart and I got knocked out, practically.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: You had said in your prior interview that the Polish and the British commanders chose you the best of the best.</span> <span id="s330">When they said you were ready, was it clear -- what did they tell you and were they putting you, Stefan Czyzewski up as a commander that when you got into Poland, you would command a unit, was that clear?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: That was clear, but I don’t think I mentioned it to [indecipherable] of the best.</span> <span id="s332">Those 17 of us, all of us were the best.</span> <span id="s333">And we ca -- we were sent back to Poland with an understanding that when we reached there, we are the only people who are trained and we automatically would assume command of small wet works groups.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: That is what I meant --</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: -- that the group was the best of the best.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: The groups a -- wa -- the -- was the best of the best.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: So that you were, in essence, an elite group who had had more training than most, so that you could go back and then lead 17 other, smaller groups?</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: Yes, that’s right.</span> <span id="s340">Yes, we -- we -- later on we did train some people in Poland, back in, especially after some of us got killed.</span> <span id="s341">We didn’t want to run out of people who knew enough.</span> <span id="s342">But resources were skimpy.</span> <span id="s343">The territory was not always safe.</span> <span id="s344">So we had a difficult time training more people in Poland in the system that the British developed for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: Now, I know you’ve told us the story of how you got back into Poland and your crossing water, and the boat.</span> <span id="s346">Did you have ins -- what were your instructions once you got into Poland?</span> <span id="s347">Where were you supposed to go?</span> <span id="s348">How were you supposed to know where to be?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: We were told to disperse and since we -- individuals who are from a different part of a country were told they -- to go into your own territory where you know people, where people know you.</span> <span id="s350">Perhaps close to where your family is and search out underground groups and join them and tell them who you are and what you can do.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: So tell us how you did that when you got back near to -- to Leshnagorra, your hometown, how did you do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: Yes, I came to my hometown, I joined my family, I stayed with them and my friends from the original -- original group, the OP, the defenders of Poland, which was already incorporate into ZWZ, appro -- came to talk to me within probably two days after I came back and say, “Hey, [indecipherable] want to rejoin?”</span> <span id="s353">“Well, tell me who and horah.”</span> <span id="s354">So we had a few meetings with local people and then we went to meetings with the so-called overall command and we identified -- I mean, I was the only one, I identified myself and told them what I could do.</span> <span id="s355">And if they had any -- had a job for me, all right, if not I will find somebody to join me.</span> <span id="s356">And of course, they accepted me.</span> <span id="s357">I went through interrogation.</span> <span id="s358">They, at that beginning did not trust me, but eventually we developed affinity.</span> <span id="s359">And after I told them what I went through and identified places where I was and the training I went through, then they tested me.</span> <span id="s360">They gave me -- I joined a small fighting group who went on a few jobs.</span> <span id="s361">And I became an advisor to the young man who ran -- who led that group.</span> <span id="s362">And about -- within -- probably within two months, they gave me my own group and I became completely independent from everybody.</span> <span id="s363">I had supervision.</span> <span id="s364">I had a commander of the district to whom I reported and who collected information on what we did and who would provide us with places to hit.</span> <span id="s365">And that was on and on and on and on, until 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: What was your attitude when you first got back?</span> <span id="s367">You had all this training.</span> <span id="s368">Were you very eager to get going right away and for people to recognize that you knew how to do this?</span> <span id="s369">What was your attitude about the process of being accepted?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s371">Well, first of all, I was cautious.</span> <span id="s372">I didn’t know who was who and who might be working for the Germans.</span> <span id="s373">After I discovered that nobody was working for the Germans, except those who openly were Bolstoitch people, a supervisor or those who ran the county or those who collected taxes and those who collected food and items for the Germans.</span> <span id="s374">Then I was eager to join whoever I could, to join to go and fight.</span> <span id="s375">I wanted to -- I mean, I was bragging about no end, I told 10 times more than I knew.</span> <span id="s376">I never unlearned to exaggerate.</span> <span id="s377">I still don’t know how not to exaggerate.</span> <span id="s378">So what I say, sometime, you should take with a big handful of salt, because it may be exaggeration.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: Tell us a little bit about actually being back home.</span> <span id="s380">Wasn’t it unusual for a -- a young Polish man to be home?</span> <span id="s381">In other words, wasn’t it suspicious that you had been away and wouldn’t that call attention to you, possibly as being an underground person?</span> <span id="s382">I’m wondering if you can explain the atmosphere to us.</span> <span id="s383">Could you, as a young Polish man, just walk around normally, or did it -- that raise questions for the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: Well, th-they --</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: And make you --</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: -- they did not -- the Germans did not have a close supervision over a countryside.</span> <span id="s387">Ours was a small village, as I mentioned previously, 52 household, built along the -- one long street and everybody knew everybody and most of the people were very patriotic.</span> <span id="s388">There were some people there who were members of the home army.</span> <span id="s389">There were some people who were members -- I mean, young boy -- young men who are members of the NSZ.</span> <span id="s390">We’ve only had two people in our district, one from my village and one from a distant village, who were members of the AL, the Communist partisan underground.</span> <span id="s391">Two, a whole two out of about 25,000.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: So did you carry false documents?</span> <span id="s393">Did you have some sort of cover of what you did?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: No, at that time -- at that time, I did not carry false documents.</span> <span id="s395">Before I came -- before I came, every Polish person would receive a so-called cancarity -- a document with your picture on it.</span> <span id="s396">You live here, you a farmer, you are this, you are that and if you wa -- if you go anyplace, you had to carry this with you.</span> <span id="s397">So when I came back, a friendly person in an administration, made the cancarta for me with a pre-date, so I was just somebody who was here all the time, never left, never was any quar -- just a young peasant, living in a small village.</span> <span id="s398">Not exactly illiterate, but not exactly bright.</span> <span id="s399">And one who brags a lot and one who likes girls and goes to dances and go places and works hard on the farm.</span> <span id="s400">And of course, shortly after that, somebody apparently was reporting and the German police would come and look for me and of course, they never -- I was never in and they kept coming and pushing my father around.</span> <span id="s401">He said, “When you came first time here, he got scared of you so badly, he just ran away, never showed up again.</span> <span id="s402">I don’t know where he is.”</span> <span id="s403">So they would beat up my father slightly, not badly.</span> <span id="s404">I mean, they didn’t break his bones, but they would make him black and blue and let be at it.</span> <span id="s405">And that was the duration.</span> <span id="s406">I would come for a visit occasionally, talk to my father and he would say a few things and he said, “Okay, you can go back, give them hell.”</span> <span id="s407">That was -- kind of a -- became everyday life.</span> <span id="s408">Like a life in a concentration camp -- in a death camp became everyday life -- normal everyday life, that also became normal, everyday life.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: Did you have a small bag of things that you always carried with you, since you were on the move so much?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: Yes, I had a backpack.</span> <span id="s411">I carried my stuff with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: And do you remember what was in that?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: One pair of underwear, one pair of socks.</span> <span id="s414">And of course I had my Schmizer with me.</span> <span id="s415">I also had a good American six shooter.</span> <span id="s416">I cherished it, because it was so dependable.</span> <span id="s417">In a short encount -- in a -- in a close encounter, that was the best.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: Do you remember the make of the gun?</span> <span id="s419">The six shooter?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: Actually, it was a ru -- it was a Russian nagant, n-a-g-a-n-t, but it was built like an American western six shooter.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: So you had a German weapon and a Russian weapon.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: Russian weapon, I had the Russian nagant, and Russian nagant, you could bury it in the mud, pull it out and it would not malfunction.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: Do you remember it -- what else was in that knapsack -- the little rucksack?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: Well, I carried couple books to read and I -- well, I had a towel, I had a piece of soap.</span> <span id="s425">I had a razor -- straight razor, which served as a razor and a couple times I used it on somebody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: As a weapon?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: Of course, yes.</span> <span id="s428">I was in couple close encounters and I used my razor.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: Do you want to tell us about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: Oh, I had it handy, I had it in my breast pocket.</span> <span id="s431">Had a little pocket sewed up in my jacket and I had it always ready.</span> <span id="s432">Yes, the SS man that met me once on a dark street and tried to identify me and pulled out a gun.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: Where was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: It was in Shedilsan, little town of Shedilsan, nearby -- oh, probably 30 miles from -- from my -- my -- from my village.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: Can you tell us a little bit about your -- a little bit more about your commander?</span> <span id="s436">This is B dad --</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: The o -- dom -- Be Dom.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: Be-Be Dom, the old oak.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: How often did you see him?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: I would see him every six weeks, every eight weeks.</span> <span id="s442">Sometime every two weeks.</span> <span id="s443">And I would get a -- it was a grapevine, “Hey, you are supposed to see -- go the Be Dom.”</span> <span id="s444">“Where?”</span> <span id="s445">“Well, you go that place, or that farm or that village.</span> <span id="s446">Go to that house.”</span> <span id="s447">I would go to that place and there would be somebody waiting for me.</span> <span id="s448">He said, “Okay, let’s go home.”</span> <span id="s449">So I would be taken to wherever he was, not the place where I was supposed to go first.</span> <span id="s450">And we’d have a talk and I would hand in my report for the last two or three, four weeks, five weeks.</span> <span id="s451">He would give me one or two or three assignments and he would alway say, “If possible.</span> <span id="s452">Do it if possible, but you better.”</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: Di -- were they written reports that you gave in, or verbal?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: Verbal.</span> <span id="s455">I wo -- they would be written.</span> <span id="s456">I would read them several times and I could even carry them for a day, but I would -- to destroy them, I would eat them most of the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: Tell us a little bit more about him -- be -- as a commander, sometimes hearing you talk about him, he was very harsh on you.</span> <span id="s458">What was your feeling towards him, or you just --</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: I felt toward him like my grandfather.</span> <span id="s460">He was very harsh, he was foul mouthed.</span> <span id="s461">Oh, could he swear.</span> <span id="s462">He was almost as bad as a -- as a good Albanian.</span> <span id="s463">Good Albanian can swear for 15 minutes and not repeat himself.</span> <span id="s464">Mr. Dom, I don’t know how long he could swear without repeating himself, but could he swear.</span> <span id="s465">And he would call me names and he would call -- call me horrible names and he was threaten me with execution every second time we met and then after we -- when we parted, he would give me a hug and we both cry.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: How long was he your commander?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: The duration.</span> <span id="s468">From the fall of 1941, until spring of 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: Did you ever meet him again?</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: No.</span> <span id="s471">Never met him.</span> <span id="s472">Never knew who -- who he was.</span> <span id="s473">Never heard of him again.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: Did you ask about him among friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: I asked about him.</span> <span id="s476">I asked about him.</span> <span id="s477">I don’t know what happened to him, if he survived, if he didn’t.</span> <span id="s478">By the way, he went on wet jobs, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: He went on your jobs?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: No, he went --</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: Oh, went -- wet --</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: -- he -- he went on --</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: -- wet works?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: On wet works, also.</span> <span id="s485">He was not supposed to.</span> <span id="s486">He was not supposed to, he was called on the carpet several times after he participated in -- in a -- in action.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: Did he tell you why he did?</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: [indecipherable] He said, “I don’t want to be completely useless.”</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: How many actions do you think you were involved in?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: I can’t count.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: It’s that many?</span></p> <p><span id="s492">A: Some months, one a week.</span> <span id="s493">Sometime twice a week.</span> <span id="s494">Sometime once a month.</span> <span id="s495">Sometime once every two months.</span> <span id="s496">I couldn’t count.</span> <span id="s497">45 - 50, maybe 60, maybe more.</span> <span id="s498">Most of it -- most of it I obliterated.</span> <span id="s499">Most of them.</span> <span id="s500">I recall almost everything, but most of my a -- most of our actions blend together and most of them I don’t want to remember.</span> <span id="s501">They were bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: Can you say what was bad about them?</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: People mutilated, people wounded and screaming.</span> <span id="s504">People with their arms blown off.</span> <span id="s505">People with their legs blown off.</span> <span id="s506">People with belly wounds, spilling out.</span> <span id="s507">Some of my people, some of the other people.</span> <span id="s508">One thing I know -- only remember, the -- my friend, whom I carried -- End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Stefan Czyzewski.</span> <span id="s510">This is tape number two, side A.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: Yes, one person I remember -- I think I mentioned him previously.</span> <span id="s512">We were surrounded, we were in a -- in a firefight and we were running and I did get hit.</span> <span id="s513">The top of my head, I did get practically scalped and he was hit in a side of a head.</span> <span id="s514">And of course, I didn’t know what happened to him, but I grabbed him and I ran with him.</span> <span id="s515">I don’t know how far it was, but it was a long distance.</span> <span id="s516">And he was about twice as heavy as I am -- as I was.</span> <span id="s517">And I carried him, his rucksack, his Schmizer.</span> <span id="s518">Then I dumped him and two of my boys came and I said, “Come on, let’s get him out of here.”</span> <span id="s519">We were out of the immediate danger.</span> <span id="s520">I said, “Come on, let’s help him.”</span> <span id="s521">Man said, “Forget it.”</span> <span id="s522">His top of a head was blown off.</span> <span id="s523">That I remember quite vividly.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: What had you been doing?</span> <span id="s525">What was the action that you were doing at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: We were surrounded.</span> <span id="s527">We all -- we were surrounded almost on purpose.</span> <span id="s528">We just let ourself be surrounded, we were trying our tactics with our new weapons.</span> <span id="s529">And it worked, except --</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: Do you remember his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: I don’t.</span> <span id="s532">I think his name was Roman, but I couldn’t be sure.</span> <span id="s533">He wasn’t with us for a long time.</span> <span id="s534">He replaced somebody who got killed and -- but he was good and he and I became friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: Early on, when you first take your command, you talk -- you talked before about a period where you lost 11 men in two months and then you describe saying, “Look, we’ve got to do some training if we want -- if we want to stop this.”</span> <span id="s536">And then you did do training and I’m wondering if you could tell us about what did you do with those men to get them in better shape?</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: We did what we -- what was done to them in Persia, by the British.</span> <span id="s538">We went through all kind of eventualities, being surrounded.</span> <span id="s539">We called on a large group of the Enerzet and we -- they had places in forests -- camps in forests, so we would infiltrate into the camps and exfiltrate.</span> <span id="s540">We would go and blow up objects.</span> <span id="s541">We would -- had a firefight with them.</span> <span id="s542">Of course, live ammunition and we were lucky, nobody got shot.</span> <span id="s543">Nobody got even scratched.</span> <span id="s544">And we would go -- go on forced marches at night.</span> <span id="s545">We would walk 10 - 15 - 20 miles with a full pack, 75 pounds.</span> <span id="s546">After that, we became almost invincible.</span> <span id="s547">We were not losing -- well, we were losing people, but maybe one every two or three months.</span> <span id="s548">But not 11 in two months.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: What was your way of being with the -- the other troops that you commanded?</span> <span id="s550">How did you get them to do the work they had to do, which was dangerous?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: Well really, I didn’t command them.</span> <span id="s552">I was with them and I told them, “If you want to be effective, imitate me.”</span> <span id="s553">And they tried to.</span> <span id="s554">I told them, “I just -- either as good or as bad as the rest of you, but I know something that you don’t.</span> <span id="s555">So, first of all, we will train,” as we did.</span> <span id="s556">“And second of all, watch what I am doing, because some things I cannot explain.”</span> <span id="s557">Which -- some tried, some didn’t.</span> <span id="s558">Some were lucky and survived.</span> <span id="s559">Some were not lucky and did not survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: Where do you think you got the self-confidence and immense courage it took to do many of these things?</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: I got an e-enormous ego.</span> <span id="s562">My ego was 10 times bigger than I was.</span> <span id="s563">And regardless how hopeless a time it was, it never was hopeless in my estimation.</span> <span id="s564">And I think that courage and bravado is contagious.</span> <span id="s565">And courage and bravado -- bravado, that was -- we lived upon it for the duration those two and a half years.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: Tell us a little bit about just how you took care of yourself.</span> <span id="s567">Where did you sleep?</span> <span id="s568">How did you eat and bathe?</span> <span id="s569">When did you have time to do these things?</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: Well, we were not as bad as the kirigas people in Siberia, who take a bath every six months if they have to or not.</span> <span id="s571">We did wash in rivers, in streams, in ponds.</span> <span id="s572">If we would stay in a farm on outskirts of a forest, we would take a hot bath.</span> <span id="s573">The family, they would boil a lot of water and put them in a big wooden tub and one by one -- we did not change water, forget it.</span> <span id="s574">If we got a big tub of hot water, all 17 of us would take a bath.</span> <span id="s575">And regardless how dirty the water is, you still can wash in it.</span> <span id="s576">We cooked on open fire.</span> <span id="s577">We frequently would get a loaf of bread from a farmer here and there.</span> <span id="s578">We would get a bottle of milk.</span> <span id="s579">Mostly we lived on bread and milk.</span> <span id="s580">We would get a good, cooked meal in somebody’s farmhouse, maybe once or twice a week.</span> <span id="s581">We carried the dry bread in our backpacks.</span> <span id="s582">That’s what I carried in my backpack, probably two pounds of dry bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: At the farmhouse they would feed 17 of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: They would feed 17 of us.</span> <span id="s585">Matter of fact, many times when we came to a farmhouse -- when we wanted to visit the farmhouse, the farmer will kill a pig and we would pig out.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: Would you pay them or were they offering this as a manner of support?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: In most cases -- in all cases, they would not accept payment.</span> <span id="s588">Sometime we paid.</span> <span id="s589">Matter of fact, after we highjacked a German bank, we spread money all over the countryside.</span> <span id="s590">And to some degree, that was our undoing.</span> <span id="s591">We had to move into a different territory.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: You left a trail.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: We left a trail.</span> <span id="s594">The German -- the Germans were wondering where tho-those marks are coming from that these people have in this neighborhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: You talked about at one point you -- you got a break from your fighting unit and you went somewhere to study psychological warfare, or you -- could you tell us more about that?</span> <span id="s596">What -- where did you go and what were you learning?</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: In a -- there was a course given for Akar and also Enerzet in Warsaw, in apraga district.</span> <span id="s598">It took about six -- six weeks, four days a week.</span> <span id="s599">There were professors from Polish -- Warsaw University.</span> <span id="s600">There were some propagandas from Polish underground.</span> <span id="s601">There was one British man who spoke Polish and nobody could understand him.</span> <span id="s602">And they talked a lot.</span> <span id="s603">It was mainly given for people who were employ -- I mean, who were publishing Polish underground papers.</span> <span id="s604">But they also took some of us -- some of the commanders of small groups in the countryside to go through this, so we would know -- be more conversant what was really going on in Poland -- in the world -- in a -- in a war in the west, in a war on the eastern front.</span> <span id="s605">And how to act against Germans of this kind and that kind.</span> <span id="s606">How to browbeat them, if you could --</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q: There -- they actually had like a day where you talked about browbeating?</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: Browbeating them.</span> <span id="s609">How to be --</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: How would you browbeat someone?</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: -- how to be ornery to them and still don’t get shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: Do you remember any of the advice they gave you in that?</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: Well, they gave us advices.</span> <span id="s614">You talk to a German and he runs the Poles and you tell him, “Why do you run the Poles down?</span> <span id="s615">My grandfather was a German general and I am Polish now and a lot of us are de-descendants of a German people.</span> <span id="s616">So you watch out.</span> <span id="s617">A lot of Poles are just like you Germans, sometime even better.”</span> <span id="s618">So some of them would accept it.</span> <span id="s619">Some of them would rail against you, some of them wou -- might even hit you, but in most cases they would listen and said, “Uh-huh, yavolt, yavolt, yavolt.”</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: And apparently you learned something about forgery during this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: Yes, I learned how to wash and how to make documents.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: How to what?</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: Wash the documents.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: Wash the documents.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: Wash the documents.</span> <span id="s626">And how to remake them.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: How -- how -- how do y -- can you tell us about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: You use chemicals to -- to get off -- especially if you write something and -- most of the documents made there were not typed, but were written in ink.</span> <span id="s629">And there was a chemical, you can wash the ink out nicely and you can dry it and use another chemical to neutralize it and then you can write again.</span> <span id="s630">Somebody’s else names, somebody’s else data.</span> <span id="s631">And I do that after the war in Germany, for people who are escaping from Poland, who could not get admitted to the displaced person camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: You helped make documents so they could get admitted?</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: So they could get admitted into displaced person camps, so they would not be vagabonds, staying in -- I mean -- fa -- I mean trying and stealing and robbing and doing things for themselves and getting, eventually, caught -- arrested and sent to jail.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: You -- you said at one point in the previous interview, that when you got to the camps, that you could almost describe that experience as mild, compared to your experience in the underground, in terms of the danger and the intensity that you experienced.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: Yes, the experience getting into the first camp, the Gross-Rosen camp --</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: That’s not what I’m asking, I’m asking -- what I’m -- I’m saying is that -- you said the camps were almost easy after being in the underground, that the underground was so dangerous and hard.</span> <span id="s637">And I’m just wondering if -- if you couldn’t say a little more about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: Yes, it were -- in a camp you were not -- before you got to know what was really going on, you felt almost a relief, because my interrogation after arrest, was very intensive.</span> <span id="s639">I was badly mistreated.</span> <span id="s640">My last few weeks in Polish underground were very intense [indecipherable] very dangerous.</span> <span id="s641">So, first coming to the camp and getting shaved and getting washed and given a uniform and being little chased around, occasionally hit, but not badly, did not feel too bad.</span> <span id="s642">Eventually, you learned how horrible it was, but it was later -- later on.</span> <span id="s643">The first impression was, was not exactly summer camp and a bet -- but better than prison, because you did not sleep, 17 of you, in a two person cell, as I did in a prison before, during my interrogation and after my sentence.</span> <span id="s644">So, first it was almost a relief that you were in a place where you could almost survive.</span> <span id="s645">Later on you learned otherwise.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: What was so intense and difficult about the last few weeks of your underground time?</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: We were very active.</span> <span id="s648">We did get into several firefights.</span> <span id="s649">We blew up few objects that mis-blew, either blew in our direction or else were mishandled.</span> <span id="s650">I was called on the carpet couple of times and threatened with execution, because you messed up the job.</span> <span id="s651">Combination of all of it can get you down, occasionally.</span> <span id="s652">Even the -- I was not as rambunctious as I always was, during last few weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: Was that a real possibility?</span> <span id="s654">Did you feel that your commanders might execute you if you did something that they really --</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: -- felt was wrong?</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: Yes, executions happened.</span> <span id="s658">I don’t -- I didn’t think he would, but executions did happen, not only for treason.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: Simply for not executing an -- a job correctly sometimes?</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: Did you think that was a fair method of treatment?</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: No, I didn’t think it was fair, but I thought was -- it was effective.</span> <span id="s663">Fairness -- fairness has nothing to do with it, effectiveness did.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: You said that sometimes after you would do an action that everyone’s nerves were very jangled and you needed to just go into the forest and be quiet for a day or two.</span> <span id="s665">What would you do?</span> <span id="s666">Where would you go and what would you do as a group to calm down after a very intense action?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: Some people would be allowed to go and visit with friends and relatives.</span> <span id="s668">In most cases we just stayed at the group.</span> <span id="s669">We were so tightly knit.</span> <span id="s670">We would tell jokes, we would get drunk.</span> <span id="s671">We would sleep a lot.</span> <span id="s672">If we had food, we would eat a lot, would pig out completely.</span> <span id="s673">Then we would drink again and after about a week or so, was good as new.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: Would you ever sing?</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: Of course, oh, we sang a lot.</span> <span id="s676">We sang a lot.</span> <span id="s677">Polish patriotic song, bawdy songs, just about anything.</span> <span id="s678">We even sang Lily Mar -- Lily Marlin.</span> <span id="s679">We even sang Soviet songs.</span> <span id="s680">We would sing the Internationale.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: And would you --</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: You know, the Internationale has a very rousing melody and a -- and great words.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q: Can you tell us some of the names that you remember of these people that you fought with?</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: I knew their pseudo-names.</span> <span id="s685">I did not -- well, I knew probably one or two or three people who were from my neighborhood.</span> <span id="s686">I knew their first and last names, but in most cases, I would simply forget them.</span> <span id="s687">We would have our names -- occasionally the names were changed and you would talk to one of them and said, “What was your name again?”</span> <span id="s688">So he would tell you.</span> <span id="s689">“That was your -- your name last week, what’s your name now?”</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: When you went to relax, did you ever meet other underground groups and were there ever women in any of the other groups, or in your group?</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: Not in our neighborhood, there were no women.</span> <span id="s692">We very seldom met other underground groups.</span> <span id="s693">Sometime we met with other underground groups to -- to -- to make comparisons, to get information, to tell how to do things.</span> <span id="s694">How we do it, how we -- do you do it?</span> <span id="s695">Can we be more -- may we be more effective if we do it your way?</span> <span id="s696">May you be more effective if you do -- do it our way?</span> <span id="s697">What are the similarity of objects that we attack?</span> <span id="s698">What are the differences?</span> <span id="s699">How to approach them better?</span> <span id="s700">You know, 40 minds are better than 20 minds.</span> <span id="s701">We would argue, we would tell them, “You don’t know a thing.</span> <span id="s702">You do it my way, you will survive.”</span> <span id="s703">He would tell -- they would tell you, “You don’t know a thing, you do it our way.</span> <span id="s704">You lost two people, we didn’t lose anybody.”</span> <span id="s705">“Well, of course you didn’t lose anybody, because you didn’t do anything.”</span> <span id="s706">It was a constant bickering.</span> <span id="s707">Some of it was serious, some of -- most of it was just jokingly doing things to relieve the tension.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: And would this be a group that was part of the NSZ, the same as your overall group, or just any other?</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: It would be, most of the time, the NSZ people.</span> <span id="s710">We would occasionally meet with the Akar people, but only formally and sometime to exchange information.</span> <span id="s711">They would frequently tell us -- tell us about certain objects that were too difficult for them.</span> <span id="s712">Sometime we would tell them about certain object were too large for us.</span> <span id="s713">They had larger groups -- they could form larger groups quickly, because they were more numerous in this particular neighborhood, so they could form -- occasionally -- occasionally, but very seldom, we would have a combined operation.</span> <span id="s714">But we never really thought much of it, because our tactics were different from their tactics.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: How were your tactics different?</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: Our tactics frequently were just a direct attack.</span> <span id="s717">Their tactics was go from behind and hit and run.</span> <span id="s718">Our tactics were mostly, go out, hit and fight.</span> <span id="s719">Because if you hit and run, you may wound somebody, you may scare somebody.</span> <span id="s720">If you attack and fight, well, you probably will get few.</span> <span id="s721">Matter of fact, sometime you get quite a few.</span> <span id="s722">So that was our tactics, constantly and my commander Be Dom alway said, “Hit fast, hit hard and if you have to run, run.</span> <span id="s723">But if you don’t have to run, you better not.</span> <span id="s724">Stay and fight.”</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: Where were you at the time that the government in exile called for the -- the Warsaw uprising by the underground?</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: I was in a concentration camp, yes, by that time.</span> <span id="s727">It was in summer of 1944.</span> <span id="s728">It was my one, two, three -- it was my fourth month.</span> <span id="s729">I was much affect -- I was in Vienna at that time, in a sub-camp of Mauthausen, in Vienna, working in a Ostermunzowerverk, building Tiger tanks.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q: Can you tell us about a friend you had, her -- her name was Nellie and apparently she was a courier?</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s732">She was a courier for the Akar and she was lucky.</span> <span id="s733">She spent four years carrying stuff.</span> <span id="s734">Propaganda, explosives, ammunition.</span> <span id="s735">And she made it.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q: How did you know her?</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: I met Nellie when she was about seven and I was 10.</span> <span id="s738">She came as a beautiful, young, city girl to have a vacation in a small, small village.</span> <span id="s739">And I was the peasant boy who met a beautiful princess.</span> <span id="s740">And we stayed friends ever after.</span> <span id="s741">She would come every year for about month and a half, two months.</span> <span id="s742">We would talk, we would go skinny-dipping.</span> <span id="s743">She would ride my horses and I would listen to her music.</span> <span id="s744">She played good violin.</span> <span id="s745">When she was about eight, she played very good violin.</span> <span id="s746">And she spent her lifetime being a musician.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: What part of the underground was she attached to?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: She was attached to the A-Akar -- to the home army.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: And can you tell us about seeing her once you were back in Poland as now a -- a resistance fighter?</span> <span id="s750">When you were back, how did you see her again, or hear of her?</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: Yeah, we met, we met.</span> <span id="s752">She was still coming for a vacation.</span> <span id="s753">She went -- she was still in grade school.</span> <span id="s754">She -- as a matter of fact, she was just finishing grade school and she immediately became a courier.</span> <span id="s755">Even when she was in school, she was a courier on a small scale.</span> <span id="s756">Then she was going to underground middle school and we would meet in Warsaw when I was there, occasionally.</span> <span id="s757">She would occasionally come to our village and we were it.</span> <span id="s758">We thought we would never forget one another when we grown up and the war ends, we’ll surely marry.</span> <span id="s759">We knew how many children we’re going to have and everything else.</span> <span id="s760">And I really should write to her presently, I know where she is.</span> <span id="s761">She married after the war, they had one son.</span> <span id="s762">Tragically, he died in his mid 30’s.</span> <span id="s763">And both she and her husband played in a symphony orchestra all their lives.</span> <span id="s764">They retired just recently.</span> <span id="s765">Their son was a musician, too.</span> <span id="s766">He played in a symphony orchestra.</span> <span id="s767">And at -- I heard -- I have it second or third hand from my first cousin, who started corresponding with her after I mentioned her once in a letter.</span> <span id="s768">And I should really write to her and -- but, you know, it was so many times, so many years.</span> <span id="s769">We live our own lives.</span> <span id="s770">Hate to open the old wounds.</span> <span id="s771">But I really ought to write her.</span> <span id="s772">She was a beautiful girl and a beautiful person.</span> <span id="s773">She had the greatest hair you ever saw.</span> <span id="s774">She had an enormous amount of hair.</span> <span id="s775">When she [indecipherable] she could sit on her hair.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: What color?</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: Dark brown.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: What did you say to her when you found out that she was carrying documents for the underground?</span> <span id="s779">What was your reaction?</span></p> <p><span id="s780">A: Well, I said, “More power to you, but be darn careful.”</span> <span id="s781">And, we talked about things.</span> <span id="s782">And I had misgivings.</span> <span id="s783">I had misgivings about my work, getting so many bystanders and so many people who are not real Nazis, killed, mutilated.</span> <span id="s784">And we talked about it and she wrote me, saying that, “Don’t feel guilty, because I don’t.”</span> <span id="s785">She said, “I carry stuff that blows up people and I don’t feel guilty.”</span> <span id="s786">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: How did you eventually come to terms with that, or make peace with that part of what you did?</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: For a long time, I did not.</span> <span id="s789">I had many, many sleepless nights.</span> <span id="s790">My conscience was really upset that so many people who did not have to die, did.</span> <span id="s791">So many people who did not have to be mutilated, did.</span> <span id="s792">Both on my side, on the -- on the other side.</span> <span id="s793">But eventually, time heals.</span> <span id="s794">And I still feel somewhat guilty.</span> <span id="s795">I have twinges of conscience.</span> <span id="s796">But I talked to people, I talked to a Catholic priest, even con -- in a concentration camps and I had misgivings about it and he said, “You should just simply forget it.</span> <span id="s797">It was a necessity.”</span> <span id="s798">Oh, by the way, Nellie married a Jew.</span> <span id="s799">Nellie married a Jewish man -- Polish Jewish man who survived a concentration camp, and lived happily ever after.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: Did your faith in God play a part in you sort of making peace in yourself with -- with these things that were bothering you?</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: Greatly.</span> <span id="s802">Mostly.</span> <span id="s803">Also, I have known many people, in Siberian camp, in the German death camp, even religious people who lost their faith, say, “If God existed, nothing as horrible as this could happen.”</span> <span id="s804">I had no problem, I never lost my faith.</span> <span id="s805">I don’t think it’s my virtue, it’s a grace.</span> <span id="s806">Never had any misgivings about the existence of God, or His/Her direction of us.</span> <span id="s807">Recently I had a -- ordered for somebody a book called a Lectionary, you know, gospels read during the mass?</span> <span id="s808">It was a Methodist Lectionary and the gospels, they made it into inclusive language and whenever it says God, it -- personal pronoun, it always says, He/She, He/She, He/She.</span> <span id="s809">It made me sick to read it.</span> <span id="s810">It’s awful, it completely disfigures it.</span> <span id="s811">We don’t know what God is.</span> <span id="s812">He may -- He is not He, He is not She, so He is -- I mean He -- It’s a God.</span> <span id="s813">But to put something like this in the Gospel, it’s just outrageous, especially the first -- the first paragraph in the gospel of John, with about 11 personal pronouns.</span> <span id="s814">I’m sorry, I’m diverting.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Q: That’s funny.</span> <span id="s816">Did you ever do an action with Nellie?</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: No, never did.</span> <span id="s818">She did not go in action.</span> <span id="s819">She carried stuff.</span> <span id="s820">And in most cases, that was more dangerous than being in action.</span> <span id="s821">Carrying a suitcase of dynamite, you endanger not yourself, but everybody in that compartment.</span> <span id="s822">They found it, everybody on spot would be executed.</span> <span id="s823">Oh, she -- many times when the train was crowded, she would bring -- pack her two suitcases and go into a German compartment and she would make the apologies, “I’m sorry, I -- the -- so tired and so hot and so crowded there, could I just sit on the floor here?”</span> <span id="s824">They say, “Oh no, floor, come on, sit -- sit on the [indecipherable]” They would sit her on the seat, they would give her so -- chocolate, they would give her some coffee to drink.</span> <span id="s825">They put her suitcases up in the rack and she would say, “Watch out, watch out, there’s some eggs in there.”</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Q: I’m sure you were in situations like that too, where you were right looking, staring into the face of someone who, if they discovered you --</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: Well, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: -- you would be in big trouble.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: Well, of course.</span> <span id="s830">Zillion of times.</span> <span id="s831">Sorry, I have to wipe my eyes now and then.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">Q: That’s all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">A: My glaucoma makes my eyes -- eyes run and I have to live with from now on.</span> <span id="s834">Nothing to it, actually.</span> <span id="s835">I can see, I can read.</span> <span id="s836">And my doctor said, “I’m going to keep you -- I’ll keep you seeing until the day you die.”</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: That’s important, because you love to read.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">A: Oh, I love to read.</span> <span id="s839">I read about 10 hours a day.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">Q: Go to the library and you get the books --</span></p> <p><span id="s841">A: Oh, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">Q: -- every week.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">A: I work in a bookstore.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Q: I know, I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">A: You will see my bookstore [indecipherable] go downtown.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">Q: Yeah, I want to see it, I do want to see it.</span> <span id="s847">You had an uncle who apparently, in an argument over food with a Communist, was murdered?</span></p> <p><span id="s848">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">Q: I’m wondering if you could tell us that story?</span></p> <p><span id="s850">A: Yes, my Uncle Brunusnous was a soldtis, which was a head of a village.</span> <span id="s851">It was a elected office -- non-paying elected office, but if you got elected, you became a prominente -- you become a prominent person.</span> <span id="s852">And he had -- he was in the Akar and he went with me on a few works -- he went with me on a few jobs.</span> <span id="s853">Also another person -- a cousin of mine -- first cousin -- his nephew and my first cousin went on a work with me.</span> <span id="s854">He had an encounter with a Communist.</span> <span id="s855">They didn’t appreciate what he was doing.</span> <span id="s856">And at one time the Communist group went on a robbery spee -- spree.</span> <span id="s857">And he investigated them.</span> <span id="s858">He did not report them to the German authorities, but they didn’t like it, so they came and shot and killed him.</span> <span id="s859">My father kind of tried to defend him, so they beat hi -- my father was badly, badly beaten.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">Q: Your father was there when this happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A: My father was approached then and tried to defend him.</span> <span id="s862">And there was -- they are pushing one another and then one of them shot him twice.</span> <span id="s863">They killed a-another of my relatives in a -- a second end of a village, who had two sons who were fighting against the Communist underground, they killed him.</span> <span id="s864">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s865">Q: This -- the uncle who was killed was killed in your village, Leshganorra?</span></p> <p><span id="s866">A: Yes, in Leshnagorra.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">Q: Leshnagorra.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: Do you know about when this happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: That was in -- in 1943 -- in fall of 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Q: And this was your father’s brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: My father’s brother.</span> <span id="s873">They live in the same house.</span> <span id="s874">One part was his, one part of my father’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">Q: So this was someone you knew very well?</span></p> <p><span id="s876">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s877">And of course, before he was killed, he took one of the -- arm of one of them, with a hatchet.</span> <span id="s878">When he out -- went out at night, he always had a hatchet under his belt.</span> <span id="s879">He had a big overcoat on and he knew that -- just before they shot him, he whipped the ha-hatchet and took arm off one of those attackers.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: So these Communists are Polish Communists?</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: Polish Communists.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">Q: And -- and they’re underground at this point, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s883">A: They were in the underground at point, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: So what was the reaction of your father and of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A: Well, those three people who killed my uncle did not survive more than about two months.</span> <span id="s886">They were killed, one by one, by my cousin, the son of the -- of my close relative who also was killed.</span> <span id="s887">That young man was a poacher.</span> <span id="s888">He could tra -- track -- trace any animal to any place, any time.</span> <span id="s889">He was hunting birds with that 22, because shotgun was too expensive to use.</span> <span id="s890">So, one by one he traced them to place where they were, he shot them, he brought the bodies to the German authorities, say, “Here, one more.”</span> <span id="s891">Then a third one was very difficult.</span> <span id="s892">H-He shot the first two -- the Germans provided him with a rifle, because he went and he said, “My father was killed, I know who those people were.</span> <span id="s893">Those were the people who are robbing and killing and raping this neighborhood.</span> <span id="s894">Give me a gun, I’ll dispose of them.”</span> <span id="s895">So they gave him manual rifle, one shot rifle.</span> <span id="s896">He killed the first one within next -- first two weeks, the one who had arm -- well, he was atta -- I mean, it was comp -- not completely detached, but he were -- had it bandaged.</span> <span id="s897">He killed a second one -- a second one next month and a third one he had a hard time getting.</span> <span id="s898">So he went on a mission.</span> <span id="s899">He ate and slept in a hedge nearby where this person’s wife lived.</span> <span id="s900">It was middle of a winter.</span> <span id="s901">He froze, he was hot, he was cold, he was hungry.</span> <span id="s902">Eventually he came to visit his wife.</span> <span id="s903">So, he got out and shot him, put him on the sled, brought his body to the authorities.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">Q: So, in that specific incident, there was some cooperation with the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s905">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s906">It was the Polish blue police and there was one German policeman who was with the Polish police.</span> <span id="s907">It was a cooperation with a -- kind of a anti-crime cooperation with the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q: What was this cousin’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: His name was Marion Borudes and he developed bad habit.</span> <span id="s910">He was very poor man, he had a beautiful, young wife and a little boy.</span> <span id="s911">He went robbing Jewish people who were in hiding.</span> <span id="s912">And the two boys from the Polish underground came in one day and shot him dead.</span> <span id="s913">Matter of fact, he was coming from a county village to the -- to our village.</span> <span id="s914">He entered our village.</span> <span id="s915">There were two boys on bicycles, said, “Marion?”</span> <span id="s916">“Yes, I am Marion.”</span> <span id="s917">“Marion Borudes?”</span> <span id="s918">“Yes, I am Marion Borudes.”</span> <span id="s919">They whipped out pistols and shot him to pieces.</span> <span id="s920">They shot him about 17 times.</span> <span id="s921">They got in the bicycles -- they took his boots off, he had a beautiful cavalry boots and they took his boots off and ran.</span> <span id="s922">And two of his older brothers ran out with rifles and [indecipherable] village, they were like maybe five -- half a kilometer -- close to one kilometer away and they got in the France and they were shooting in them.</span> <span id="s923">So they dropped the boots and ran away.</span> <span id="s924">They didn’t get hit.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: How do you know they shot him for the stealing from the Jews in hiding?</span> <span id="s926">How was that made clear?</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A: It was an execution -- underground court has a execution -- were notif -- people were notified.</span> <span id="s928">Matter of fact, there was a document left on him for the -- they read hi -- they read him the sentence.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q: Well, I think I have covered what I wanted to cover about your time in the Resistance and I’m probably going to move on to the post war ins -- I thought we could maybe take a break now.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: Okay, let’s take a break.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: An-And just -- but does it seem like we covered the --</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q: One last question about the training you received to become an underground fighter, and this is when you were still in Iran and it -- can you tell us about your farewell party?</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: Yes, at the end of our training, just before we were sent on a trip back, a local -- I don’t know if he was a nomad, but I know he had a beautiful tent in the desert, nearby our -- our camp.</span> <span id="s935">He apparently was a person of consequence, because he had a beautiful tent, he had several wives and a lot of children and he had a party for us.</span> <span id="s936">And for some reason or another -- I think because I was the smallest one -- so he gave me the biggest two pillows to sit on and I must have become some kind of a prominent person in his estimation, because his beau -- most beautiful wife was serving me and she sa -- even sat next to me couple of times.</span> <span id="s937">And then, when the main course came, or the most important course came, which was sheep eyes, it was a big dish of sheep eyes, he handed them to me and he said, “You eat as many of those as you can.”</span> <span id="s938">Because that was an so-called honor dish.</span> <span id="s939">So I said, “Well, I thank you very much for your recognition, but I would like to share it with all of you, so you are the first one to share with me.”</span> <span id="s940">So he took one and ev -- I sent it around and everybody took one.</span> <span id="s941">By the time it came back to me, there was only one eye left.</span> <span id="s942">So I put it in and I swallowed it, almost choked on it.</span> <span id="s943">And, you cannot chew a sheep’s eye, just like a little billiard ball.</span> <span id="s944">You swallow it And I did choke at the end, of course.</span> <span id="s945">Then, there was a cumis to drink.</span> <span id="s946">And cumis is an Arabian and Persian drink that is made of 100 percent alcohol and mir -- milk.</span> <span id="s947">They put it in a leather bag, a man gets on a horse and he rides out of a des -- in a desert -- in heat, whatever.</span> <span id="s948">And he rides a long distance there and a long distance back and that thing gets way -- well shaken -- well mixed.</span> <span id="s949">Then they cool it off and you drink it.</span> <span id="s950">And is the smoothest drink you have ever drunk.</span> <span id="s951">And if yo -- and it’s -- it goes in so neatly, but man, the katzenjammer you get.</span> <span id="s952">That was the worst hangover I ever had.</span> <span id="s953">After I drank the drink, I almost dropped.</span> <span id="s954">I sat for the rest of the party, I didn’t know where I was.</span> <span id="s955">I was sick all night.</span> <span id="s956">I was mo -- sick most of the next morning and I forswore alcohol forever and a day.</span> <span id="s957">Well, of course, I didn’t drink for at least four weeks after that.</span> <span id="s958">That was the greatest party I ever went to and I don’t remember much of it after the first drink.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">Q: Okay, I’d like to move into the post war period.</span> <span id="s960">Initially, you are -- recuperate in a sanitorium and then, can you tell us about when you’re first taken to Wildeflecken?</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: Wildeflecken, yes.</span> <span id="s962">To quickly go through it, from Gusensfite, those of us who were half dead, were immediately transported to Hokenfelds, which was in West Germany.</span> <span id="s963">It was in early May, shortly after liberation.</span> <span id="s964">They stabilized us, we did get a little milk mixed with water and a gruel, kind of like a baby food, for some time.</span> <span id="s965">So I was in the field hospital in Hokenfelds for a short time, then I was transported to Statishere Hospital in Bamburg, West Germany, Bavaria.</span> <span id="s966">It was in June and I was there until October, 1945, with a bad case with tuberculosis and a bad case of starvation.</span> <span id="s967">By October --</span></p> <p><span id="s968">Q: At this point, when you’re in the hospital for these various months, from June to October, what are you eating at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s969">A: We were -- received very light hospital food, mostly soups.</span> <span id="s970">Very little bread, very, very little meat.</span> <span id="s971">If there was a meat, it was a kind of almost like it was pre-digested.</span> <span id="s972">By October I could sit, I could even walk.</span> <span id="s973">I could even walk to the bathroom all by myself.</span> <span id="s974">I could go hide in a bathroom, lock my door and smoke.</span> <span id="s975">And sister will -- soon I would come and bang on the door and say, “Stefan, doshturb.</span> <span id="s976">Steve -- Stefan, you are going to die.</span> <span id="s977">Don’t smoke.</span> <span id="s978">Nicht rowken.</span> <span id="s979">You are not supposed to smoke.”</span> <span id="s980">And I think I owe her my life, because she made me stop smoking and I never smoked since.</span> <span id="s981">Anyway --</span></p> <p><span id="s982">Q: And this was --</span></p> <p><span id="s983">A: It was in a state hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Q: Her -- her name was?</span></p> <p><span id="s985">A: Sister Ursula.</span> <span id="s986">She is in my --</span></p> <p><span id="s987">Q: Sister Ursula?</span></p> <p><span id="s988">A: Ursula.</span> <span id="s989">She is in my previous -- in my previous interview.</span> <span id="s990">I even spell her name on the form later on.</span> <span id="s991">Then I was sent to TB Sanitorium in Foreheim, which is also in Bavaria.</span> <span id="s992">I was there from November ‘45, to April, 1946, eating mostly dairy food.</span> <span id="s993">A lot of butter, lot of cream, lot of milk and white -- white bread.</span> <span id="s994">My stomach recuperated completely.</span> <span id="s995">Actually, before I left -- before I left Bamburg Hospital, my lungs -- the liquid collecting in my lungs was pumped out of me and my stomach was also pumped out.</span> <span id="s996">Don’t ever let your stomach be pumped out, that’s the most horrible feeling you ever had.</span> <span id="s997">From Foreh-Foreheim Sanitorium, which, when it was liquidated in April of 1945, we were transported to Lohr, L-o-h-r, also in Bavaria.</span> <span id="s998">I was there for sh -- very short time in July, 1945 -- I’m sorry, 1946.</span> <span id="s999">Then, I completely recovered and was transferred to displaced person camp in Ashafenberg.</span> <span id="s1000">It was Eyager Casernin, former German army camp, close to the city.</span> <span id="s1001">I work part time as a kitchen help, part, later on, as a accountant in kitchen accounting department.</span> <span id="s1002">And then I becames a glorified long distance runner, between three local camps, delivering messages from the camp authorities.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">Q: Literally running?</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">A: Well, a bicycle -- bicycle, on foot.</span> <span id="s1005">Later on, I traveled to ash -- to Swineferd on a motorcycle.</span> <span id="s1006">I had the best American motorbike you ever had, it was Harley Davidson, 1941.</span> <span id="s1007">Biggest ever, 407 -- 750 cc’s, at that time it was the biggest.</span> <span id="s1008">Now, the biggest one is about three times as powerful.</span> <span id="s1009">So, I was in Ashafenberg DP camp, from 1946, July, to sometime in 1947, or early 1948.</span> <span id="s1010">In 1948, the camp was liquidated.</span> <span id="s1011">The camp was liquidated and you were sent to Wildeflecken.</span> <span id="s1012">It was an e-enormous Polish DP camp.</span> <span id="s1013">It was also an army camp previously, where SS mountain troops were being trained.</span> <span id="s1014">There were a lot of skis, so we did a lot of skiing.</span> <span id="s1015">I ran out in many trees going down the hill.</span> <span id="s1016">That time I worked as a -- beginning as a stenographer and for the duration, I worked as a detective in crime bureau and also part time, I worked with a American army CIC with Captain Vulcanovsky.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q: Okay, good.</span> <span id="s1018">I think that’s a important summary and then there are a few places I’d like to revisit and s-spend a little more time on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">A: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">Q: If you can think back to the displaced person’s camp that -- the one -- the second to the last, where you were at from 1946 to ‘48.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">A: Yeah, it is -- so it was in Ashafenberg, the Yagercaserra -- Yaggercaservna.</span> <span id="s1024">Like --</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">Q: Tell us what -- what that was like?</span> <span id="s1026">What did it physically look like, and when you were brought in, where were you settled?</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">A: It was an army camp.</span> <span id="s1028">There were brick buildings, three, four and five story high.</span> <span id="s1029">The rooms were small and each room would have a family or several single people.</span> <span id="s1030">In my room, there were two families.</span> <span id="s1031">There was a husband and wife.</span> <span id="s1032">There was a lady with a child and I was the fifth person.</span> <span id="s1033">We had bunk beds.</span> <span id="s1034">We slept, we ate there.</span> <span id="s1035">The food was given in a camp kitchen.</span> <span id="s1036">You went with a container and he brou -- you brought your tea in the morning with a slice of bread and some margarine.</span> <span id="s1037">You received a soup at noon and you received a soup at night, also with some tea.</span> <span id="s1038">Many people would be given some non -- unpaid service jobs.</span> <span id="s1039">Matter of fact, everybody had to do some work on maybe half a day a week or a day every two weeks, to clean, to sweep, to dig, to shovel, to do whatever.</span> <span id="s1040">Some people were employed full times; those who worked in a kitchen, those who worked in a public works, those who served as a camp police.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Stefan Czyzewski.</span> <span id="s1043">This is tape number three, side A. B-Before we go a little further with that, it occurred to me, were you surprised that you were able to recover?</span> <span id="s1044">I mean, your body, when you were in the sanitoriums or in the different hospitals, were you worried that maybe you weren’t going to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">A: Yes, I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">Q: -- get your strength back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">A: Yes, I was.</span> <span id="s1048">I was so debilitated, I didn’t think I would ever surprise -- ev-ever survive.</span> <span id="s1049">When I did and became well, I was just flabbergasted.</span> <span id="s1050">First of all, it was freedom and second of all, I was healthy.</span> <span id="s1051">I was very healthy.</span> <span id="s1052">I could run, I could do things.</span> <span id="s1053">I could climb.</span> <span id="s1054">I could just about -- li-like my previous time.</span> <span id="s1055">I mean, my young age.</span> <span id="s1056">I was small.</span> <span id="s1057">Big kids beat on me.</span> <span id="s1058">I could always hit somebody and run fast and nobody ever could catch up with me.</span> <span id="s1059">And the thing -- and this condition came back after I recuperated -- after I got out of the sanitorium.</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">Q: Did you notice some things that didn’t come back?</span> <span id="s1061">You didn’t quite get your full strength back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s1063">I did not.</span> <span id="s1064">I not.</span> <span id="s1065">My hair grew up.</span> <span id="s1066">My -- I had my teeth repaired; some of them were knocked out.</span> <span id="s1067">And matter of fact, I still have one bridge -- stationary bridge of steel teeth, that was made by the German doctor in 1947.</span> <span id="s1068">I still have it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Q: What had happened to your hair?</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">A: Well, our hairs were shaved, or clipped.</span> <span id="s1071">And in the middle of a he -- from the front to the back, there was a inch and a half strip that’s all shaved every week and they -- we used to call it Adolf Hitlerstrasser.</span> <span id="s1072">If you escaped from a camp, people could recognize it, you were an inmate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">Q: When you were recovering, were there foods that you really wanted, but you weren’t able to have?</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">A: Yes, there was a lot of food that you really would have wanted, but you ate what you were given.</span> <span id="s1075">The food was scarce at that time and hospital food was kind of awful, but it was nourishing.</span> <span id="s1076">Sanitorium food was just great.</span> <span id="s1077">There was a good, white bread.</span> <span id="s1078">There was a lot of butter and a lot and lot of milk and even little meat.</span> <span id="s1079">And also, we did get Red Cross packages.</span> <span id="s1080">Each person received one every two or three weeks, which were greatly helpful.</span> <span id="s1081">There was some little American sausages, little wieners that were the most -- I can close my eyes and I can taste them, how great they were.</span> <span id="s1082">And there was a chunk of chocolate.</span> <span id="s1083">And I always was crazy for chocolate.</span> <span id="s1084">I think I mentioned a previous interview that one time the packages came and the chocolate was moldy.</span> <span id="s1085">So I traded with everybody and I did get probably five, six, maybe even 10 big chunks of chocolate, probably four or five ounces each and I ate myself sick.</span> <span id="s1086">And I couldn’t look in a -- chocolate in the face for next two months at least.</span> <span id="s1087">But I went back to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">Q: Do you still like chocolate?</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">A: I’m still -- I still like chocolate very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">Q: I’ve heard a lot about these packages, particularly everyone mentions the chocolate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">A: Well, of course.</span> <span id="s1092">We were starved for chocolate.</span> <span id="s1093">Chocolate was not available in Europe -- Europe that whole war time.</span> <span id="s1094">Five, six, seven years.</span> <span id="s1095">The Germans would sell their soul for a piece of chocolate.</span> <span id="s1096">A lady would sell her daughter, I mean, a husband would se -- would sell his wife for -- for a package of American cigarettes, or a chunk of chocolate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">Q: And when exactly did you quit smoking?</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">A: In 1945, in summer, in Bamberg shtateecha hospital.</span> <span id="s1099">And Sister Ursula was it.</span> <span id="s1100">She was an old German nun -- nun, and she was very persistent and she watched me like a hawk.</span> <span id="s1101">She made me smo -- stop smoking.</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">Q: So it really was because she was hounding you about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">A: Yeah, she was hounding me.</span> <span id="s1104">She -- she wi -- told me, “You will die if you smoke.</span> <span id="s1105">Your lungs are so bad.</span> <span id="s1106">You are full of liquid, you cannot breathe and you smoke?</span> <span id="s1107">You a stupid kid.</span> <span id="s1108">Du fareek da kind.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">Q: When you were in the sanitorium and then the Di-Displaced Persons camp, how -- what was your attitude towards food?</span> <span id="s1110">Did you trust that food would be there or did you find yourself wanting to take it back to your room for instance?</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">A: In some -- some camps, you could take it to your room.</span> <span id="s1112">You went and the -- in -- in Wildeflecken, there were -- there were eating halls that you went and ate, especially for the people who worked.</span> <span id="s1113">Starting in Ashafenberg, later in Wildeflecken, I always had a job.</span> <span id="s1114">So those of us who worked had a special dining room.</span> <span id="s1115">The food was not diff -- any different from the rest of the people’s food, but the room was nicer and we ate there.</span> <span id="s1116">There even occasionally was a dessert.</span> <span id="s1117">And I had two friends, Captain Psheckfass and Lieutenant Penjik.</span> <span id="s1118">And whenever came to a dessert, Captain Psheckfass started talking about those horrible bodies being carried out of a gas chamber, to the crematorium, to the cooler room and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s1119">And Mr. Penjik, who’d said, “Disgusting.”</span> <span id="s1120">He would toss his fork and walk away and Mr. -- and Captain Penjik, who’d ate Mr. -- Captain Psheckfass would eat Mr. Penjik’s dessert.</span> <span id="s1121">Never failed, it always worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">Q: And you were sitting there laughing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">A: And I was sitting, eating my own and laughing.</span> <span id="s1124">Sometime before Mr. Psheckfass -- Captain Psheckfass grabbed Mr. Penjik’s dessert, I grabbed it first.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">Q: What were dinner conversations like a-at that table?</span> <span id="s1126">What were you talking about?</span> <span id="s1127">What were people talking about when they weren’t working at the camp [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">A: Well, they were -- they were worrying about their relatives -- friends and relatives back in Poland.</span> <span id="s1129">They were worrying what they are going to do.</span> <span id="s1130">They were worrying if they were maybe -- if they may be forced to repatriate back to Communist Poland.</span> <span id="s1131">They were discussing possibilities of emigration.</span> <span id="s1132">At that time, all in 1945, six, even seven, nobody dreamed that he -- they would be able to go to America.</span> <span id="s1133">America was kind of a seventh heaven somewhere way up there.</span> <span id="s1134">Nobody thought they would ever be able to reach it.</span> <span id="s1135">So, many people started emigrating in 1948, to Belgium, to work in the coal mines.</span> <span id="s1136">To Great Britain to work in the coal mines.</span> <span id="s1137">Later on, when emigration became available to Canada, many people -- many, many people went to Canada.</span> <span id="s1138">Then eventually, U.S. legislation passed a special bill that allowed the refugees from Displaced Person camp to come here outside of the quota.</span> <span id="s1139">They still ha-had kind of a quota and people from certain countries had easier time coming here than from others.</span> <span id="s1140">And the Polish people especially, were given certain preference.</span> <span id="s1141">So, a lot of Polish Jewish people were coming to America and a lot of Poles were coming to America.</span> <span id="s1142">And a lot of Russian, Ukrainian and White Russian people, falsify a doc -- their documents as if they were Polish citizens, and also came in here.</span> <span id="s1143">So the conversations, a lot of it was, “Can I go to America?</span> <span id="s1144">Can I go to Australia?</span> <span id="s1145">Oh, can I go to Canada?”</span> <span id="s1146">But everybody wanted to come to the seventh heaven, which was America.</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">Q: Were you -- who else was in the camp?</span> <span id="s1148">The way you just described it, it sounds like there were other Poles?</span> <span id="s1149">But who -- who made up the camp population?</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">A: The Ashafenberg camp was a mixture of White Russians, few Russians, some Ukrainians and Poles, but Poles constituted about 90 percent of the population in -- in our Ashafenberg camp.</span> <span id="s1151">The other two camps in Ashafenberg, Displaced Person camps, one was strictly Ukrainian and one was strictly Russian and -- and White Russian.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">Q: So, is that why you were sent there?</span> <span id="s1153">To Ashafenberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1156">Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">A: Wildeflecken was strictly a Polish camp.</span> <span id="s1158">There were some Latvians and Estonians and a few, very few White Russians.</span> <span id="s1159">But there were no Ukrainians and no Russian Russians.</span> <span id="s1160">Probably Poles were there 90 -- probably 98 percent Polish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">Q: Now, when you were in Ashafenberg, it was ‘46, ‘47, until early ‘48.</span> <span id="s1162">This is a pretty long time after the war has ended.</span> <span id="s1163">How -- what were people’s feelings about that; that they had been li-living in Displaced Person’s camps for so long?</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">A: Well, they didn’t have chance to get jobs in Germany.</span> <span id="s1165">There was hunger, privation and no jobs to be had.</span> <span id="s1166">Also, we were not allowed to apply for civilian jobs.</span> <span id="s1167">So they were kind of kept caged.</span> <span id="s1168">If you wanted to go out, you had to have a permission -- written permission to go out, with a hope of emigrating somewhere.</span> <span id="s1169">Some Russian and some White Russian people were forced to repatriate to their respective countries.</span> <span id="s1170">And of course, we heard later on that all of them were dr -- went directly to si -- to Siberia.</span> <span id="s1171">And Polish people, Czech people, Hungarian and Romanians and the Baltic countries, people were not forced to repatriate, so they just waited.</span> <span id="s1172">Sit -- sat, vegetated in Germany.</span> <span id="s1173">Developed bad habits like not working, or drinking and waiting for the heaven to open somewhere.</span> <span id="s1174">And eventually, most of us emigrated.</span> <span id="s1175">Most of us came to United States, a lot went to Canada and Australia.</span> <span id="s1176">Some to Great Britain, some to the low countries to get the most menial jobs that nobody else wanted to take.</span> <span id="s1177">I had a friend who was a black market operator in Wildeflecken camp and when his half a day a week assignment came, he never showed up.</span> <span id="s1178">Or else he would pay somebody to go and do his shoveling or splitting the wood.</span> <span id="s1179">Eventually, he was called to a camp administrator who was -- who was American -- who was American lady.</span> <span id="s1180">And he was questioned and said mer -- she said, “Mr. So and so, I heard that you have not gone last week and this week to -- to your assigned work.</span> <span id="s1181">What is the matter with you?”</span> <span id="s1182">And he said, “Lady, that’s a lie.</span> <span id="s1183">They are schmearing me.</span> <span id="s1184">I have never went to wor -- begun to work.</span> <span id="s1185">I have never yet did any work.</span> <span id="s1186">I pay people to work for me.”</span> <span id="s1187">“Well, how can you afford it?”</span> <span id="s1188">“Well, see, I’m great black market operator.</span> <span id="s1189">And I’m lucky because I never get caught.”</span> <span id="s1190">So that wa -- she laughed and she let him go.</span> <span id="s1191">By the way, the administrator of Wildeflecken camp was Miss Catherine Hulme, H-u-l-m-e.</span> <span id="s1192">And there is a beautiful book written by her about the Wildeflecken camp.</span> <span id="s1193">It was called, “The Wild Place.”</span> <span id="s1194">It was published in 1950’s and I had had a copy and I loaned it to somebody, never got it back.</span> <span id="s1195">Has been out of print since about 1960’s and I can presume that the museum might have a copy.</span> <span id="s1196">If they don’t, they should really search for it and find it.</span> <span id="s1197">She was a good writer, especially when she wrote about Mrs. Captain.</span> <span id="s1198">There was a tough underground captain, lady from Polish underground army, who ran a block -- a barrack -- probably couple hundred former prostitutes.</span> <span id="s1199">She put them all on a -- on a s-straight and narrow.</span> <span id="s1200">None of them ever did any trade in Wildeflecken when -- when the Mrs. Captain was there.</span> <span id="s1201">She was just like a god, like a block as -- altester in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1202">Watch out, don’t cross Mrs. Captain.</span> <span id="s1203">She was an old lady, she was big, she was bowlegged.</span> <span id="s1204">She -- when they had a parade, she would walk ahead of her troops.</span> <span id="s1205">She was a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">Q: Her troops of former prostitutes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">A: No, sh-she ran the group -- I mean, she supervised a group of former prostitutes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">Q: Yeah, okay, right.</span> <span id="s1209">But tho-those were her troops, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">A: Those were her troops.</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">Q: Okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">A: She had trained them, she had uniformed them and she d-dared them, “Any of you to play your trade, you are going to be brained.”</span> <span id="s1213">And when they marched down the s -- down the street in a parade, you could -- I mean, you could just hold your stomach and laugh because she was kind of biggish and she had very bowlegged legs and she had the army boots on and she had very short army skirt.</span> <span id="s1214">She was a sight.</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">Q: Why do you think the author, the -- the former director of the camp called it the wild place?</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">A: Because Wildeflecken means the wild place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">A: Yeah, Wildeflecken is the wild place in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">Q: Were there moments of real lightheartedness in the dis -- in Wildeflecken?</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">A: Nine out of 10 hours were lighthearted.</span> <span id="s1221">Everybody was drunk with freedom.</span> <span id="s1222">Everybody was completely intoxicated with freedom.</span> <span id="s1223">When you thought back what was there before and what was then, it was just unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1224">And when we talked or when I reflected occasionally, I saw myself in Gusensfie, getting off the train and walking under the viaduct to the tunnel, to dig and work.</span> <span id="s1225">And over the viaduct, passing trains would be going on and people standing in the windows, leaning out of the windows, eating and drinking and billing -- being free.</span> <span id="s1226">And saw those beautiful German, blonde girls leaning out and looking on them and you heart was so sick looking at that freedom those people had and looking at yourself, that you were going -- may be killed today or tomorrow or starve to death or drowned tonight by a capo or ha -- you head to -- was -- to -- bashed in that night by another capo.</span> <span id="s1227">So then frequently, when you later on thought about this and about what was then, after liberation, you just were completely intoxicated with that freedom.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">Q: Were people talking about what had happened to them?</span> <span id="s1229">Is that something that people had a need to go into detail about?</span> <span id="s1230">Did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">A: A lot of people did.</span> <span id="s1232">Lot of people shared.</span> <span id="s1233">Some people couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1234">And many of us were quite abnormal.</span> <span id="s1235">We hoarded food.</span> <span id="s1236">We picked up every scrap of everything on the street.</span> <span id="s1237">Even now, when I walk down the street and I see a penny, or a piece of paper, or an old shoelace, I pick it up.</span> <span id="s1238">We just hoarded everything, because well, you never know.</span> <span id="s1239">Maybe tomorrow you are going to be hungry or maybe I want to tie my shoes and I wouldn’t have anything to tie them with.</span> <span id="s1240">And most of us kind of outgrew it and adjusted.</span> <span id="s1241">At least, I hope I adjusted.</span> <span id="s1242">I have some strange custom and habits and thoughts occasionally, but I don’t rave and don’t -- well, don’t seem to be abnormal.</span> <span id="s1243">I had a wife who lives with me forever and she somehow stands me.</span> <span id="s1244">But many of us became quite abnormal.</span> <span id="s1245">I think I mentioned previously a father of a young girl I met here, who came to talk to me about the life there and I discover later on that he was a Jewish man.</span> <span id="s1246">And I told her that she should ask him to tell her what happened to him.</span> <span id="s1247">He survived the whole war in a Polish forest with a group of partisans, or by -- and by himself.</span> <span id="s1248">He does not want to talk about it, not a word.</span> <span id="s1249">He doesn’t want to talk, so I ask her to wor -- “Well, ask him to write it down.”</span> <span id="s1250">“He doesn’t know how to write.”</span> <span id="s1251">“Well, ask him to write in Polish.”</span> <span id="s1252">“He doesn’t know how to write in Polish.”</span> <span id="s1253">“Well, how about Yiddish?”</span> <span id="s1254">“He doesn’t know how to write it Yiddish.”</span> <span id="s1255">He’s completely illiterate and he doesn’t want to talk about it.</span> <span id="s1256">After all that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">Q: Can you tell us when and how you be -- you -- you became a stenographer for the police and I believe this was in Wildeflecken.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">A: Yes, I took a st-steno course in Ashafenberg just before I left and just before I left, I applied for a steno job with the police or the camp administrator office.</span> <span id="s1259">And my best friend, Captain Psheckfass, who was a police commander there, he negated my application.</span> <span id="s1260">Then, when we were transferred to Wildeflecken --</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">Q: Do you know why he did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">A: He thought I was too foxy.</span> <span id="s1263">He knew a little about my document washing, or else he had heard a rumor about my document washing.</span> <span id="s1264">He was afraid if I have access to documents, especially to the copies -- I mean, to the f -- blanks of documents, I may sneak some out.</span> <span id="s1265">By -- when I -- when we moved to Wildeflecken, he tried to do the same thing, but he was overruled by Captain Jaigiss, who was a liaison officer with the American army.</span> <span id="s1266">And Mr. Jaigiss made he -- me his personal stenographer and he put me into the investigation -- into crime office.</span> <span id="s1267">Made me into a great detective, which I wasn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">Q: What did they know about your background, in terms of the war and the -- the -- your resistance?</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">A: They knew that I was a former prisoner.</span> <span id="s1270">They didn’t know anything about my resistance work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">Q: And you didn’t tell them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">A: I did not.</span> <span id="s1273">Occasionally I mentioned that I did some work before I was arrested.</span> <span id="s1274">Especially, I -- well the -- they di -- “You got arrested, didn’t you?”</span> <span id="s1275">“Well, yes.”</span> <span id="s1276">“Did you steal a car?</span> <span id="s1277">Did you steal a chicken?”</span> <span id="s1278">I said, “Well, yes, something like that.”</span> <span id="s1279">But there was no time to brag about that time.</span> <span id="s1280">But later on, when they asked questions, I mentioned that I served in Polish underground.</span> <span id="s1281">And especially in 1948, when I was in Wildeflecken, a British man came -- missions were coming, visiting camps and British man came for a visit and I was in the office and he came in the office and we recognized one another.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">Q: Where was he from?</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">A: He was my trainer in Persia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">Q: And his name was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">A: Captain Thompson.</span> <span id="s1286">Well, he were -- by that time he was Brigadier Thompson.</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">Q: Can you tell us about that?</span> <span id="s1288">Seeing him, talking to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">A: Oh, we had a short talk, then lunchtime he went to -- to our dining room and we sat and talked during the lunch time.</span> <span id="s1290">And he said, “Well, not much I can do for you, but I reread your reports just recently and your little group did as my -- as much damage as my brigade -- OSS brigade did.</span> <span id="s1291">So I’ll do something.”</span> <span id="s1292">And he actually did.</span> <span id="s1293">The Polish authorities in Great Britain sent me a form to fill out and they wanted to give me Polish vertudtimilitary and I sent them a letter back, telling them what to put it in, where to stick it.</span> <span id="s1294">Because, when we were fighting in Poland, they did not want to give any help to that part of underground that I was in.</span> <span id="s1295">And later on they wanted to share in the glory.</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">Q: Who didn’t want to give any help?</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">A: The Polish government in exile in Great Britain.</span> <span id="s1298">They helped only the Akar, the home army.</span> <span id="s1299">They did not -- did not want to help the NSZ, because we -- we were the -- well, kind of perhaps, according to them, chauvinistic group.</span> <span id="s1300">They didn’t want to have much to do with us.</span> <span id="s1301">They would accept our reports.</span> <span id="s1302">They would accept our reports, especially my group and two other groups, they would accept the reports and send -- and give them to the British authorities, but they would not help us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">Q: What kind of help did you need that they didn’t give?</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">A: Plastic explosives.</span> <span id="s1305">Some arms and ammunition, especially British sten guns.</span> <span id="s1306">They were very, very good, they were almost as good as the German schmizers.</span> <span id="s1307">We did not get any -- get any out of them.</span> <span id="s1308">We did get some occasionally, but it was buying, stealing, smuggling.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">Q: What other things did you and the Brigadier General --</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">A: Thompson.</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">Q: Thompson, speak of?</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">A: Oh, we talked -- he talked about his brigade, working --sending un -- sending -- flying people and dumping them in Germany behind the front lines and in occupied France.</span> <span id="s1313">His brigade was fighting in Belgium.</span> <span id="s1314">They would drop behind the German lines.</span> <span id="s1315">And we talked about -- we talked about, especially about the V2 that my group fished out o-of Aboog River and the British sent a plane to ta -- to take it to Great Britain.</span> <span id="s1316">The German flying bomb.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">Q: That’s the B2?</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">A: V2, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">Q: And he -- he knew about what you had done?</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">A: He knew that.</span> <span id="s1321">He knew it must not -- it was my group who did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">Q: Did he recognize you right away when he walked in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">A: Yes, he did.</span> <span id="s1324">I recognized him, mainly.</span> <span id="s1325">But I said, “Man, you got bald.”</span> <span id="s1326">And he said, “You don’t have many hair, either.”</span> <span id="s1327">He was a big, big man, probably six foot four or six foot five.</span> <span id="s1328">And I reach about [indecipherable] just about to his -- to his hip.</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">Q: And did you speak to him in English?</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">A: No, we spoke German.</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">Q: You spoke German?</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1333">I knew -- I knew some English, but very -- we tri -- I tried to try my English on him, but he said, “Oh, forget it.</span> <span id="s1334">Let’s pick German.”</span> <span id="s1335">And he knew little Polish, too.</span> <span id="s1336">We spoke German -- a gibberish of Polish and German.</span> <span id="s1337">And I said, “Oh, Major Thompson.”</span> <span id="s1338">He said, “Brigadier Thompson for you.”</span> <span id="s1339">I said, “What happened to you?</span> <span id="s1340">How do you get to be a Brigadier?</span> <span id="s1341">You were just a Major.</span> <span id="s1342">I don’t th-think even you were a Major, I think you were Captain.”</span> <span id="s1343">“Oh yes, yes, I was a Major.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">Q: But it was a good meeting?</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">A: It was a good meeting, yes.</span> <span id="s1346">Oh, he gave me si -- hi-his hat.</span> <span id="s1347">He gave me his beret.</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">Q: His beret?</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1350">And I had it -- I wore it out completely.</span> <span id="s1351">Then short -- shortly -- I mean, a few years ago, I got one identical one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">Q: What did he say when he gave it to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">A: “I -- there’s nothing I can give you.</span> <span id="s1354">Why don’t you have my hat at least?”</span> <span id="s1355">“But you are bald and your head when you -- you are going to be cold.”</span> <span id="s1356">“Never mind, I got one -- I got another.</span> <span id="s1357">I have a formal one in my baggage.”</span> <span id="s1358">End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Stefan Czyzewski.</span> <span id="s1360">This is tape number three, side B.</span> <span id="s1361">So tell us a little bit about your job as a stenographer for the police department.</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">A: The liaison officer would dictate to me and I would transcribe and he would -- letters to his -- people like him in the various different camps.</span> <span id="s1363">He was kind of a head man of all of them and he would receive letters and he -- then he would write a lot of memos, which I would write -- write and transcribe, then put in a file.</span> <span id="s1364">And later on, when he relinquished me to the police department, I would participate in -- in-interrogation, when a few people were interrogating somebody, I would write it down and later transcribe.</span> <span id="s1365">Then, when I interrogate -- later on, when I became detective, an interrogator myself, I would write in the shorthand and later transcribe and make them -- I mean, ask them to sign, if they were willing.</span> <span id="s1366">If they were not willing, they had to sign anyway.</span> <span id="s1367">Little arm bending always helps.</span> <span id="s1368">And later on, when I participating in some interrogation of Germans by the CIC people, I would take short hand, later transcribe it in Polish or German and somebody else would translate into English.</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">Q: What kinds of police matters were being looked into in Wild-Wildeflecken?</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">A: Thefts, robberies.</span> <span id="s1371">Occasionally a murder.</span> <span id="s1372">Then, there was a lot of medical malpra-malpractice, people who were killed in abortions.</span> <span id="s1373">Some suicides at the -- there was those ber -- bring -- that were suspected of -- as -- as murders.</span> <span id="s1374">There was one some -- there was some fathers who abused their daughters sexually, and such.</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">Q: So you would be asked to come in and take notes during an interrogation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">A: I would have police bring that person to the office and I would interrogate them and write it down and then talk to them again and ask them if they were willing to sign whatever they told me.</span> <span id="s1377">And in most cases, they were willing to sign.</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">Q: Were you interviewing witnesses?</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">A: Inter -- witnesses and perpetrators.</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">Q: And perpetrators?</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">Q: And how long did you do this for?</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">A: Well, ‘48, ‘49.</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1385">And can you tell us a little bit about how -- how you made the transition from initially being sort of on the sidelines of events to actually being the person to do the interrogating?</span> <span id="s1386">How did that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">A: We had a -- we had a criminal judge who ran the department and we would -- each day, at the end of the day, we would be given an hour lecture on procedures and ways and -- and means.</span> <span id="s1388">So, after a few months of that, most of us became quite adept interrogators and detectives.</span> <span id="s1389">Went in the field work, had a shoot out occasionally with some people who were robbing and stealing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">Q: In the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">A: Outside of camp.</span> <span id="s1392">People from camp -- young men from camp would go into German countryside and rob and steal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">Q: What -- how did you feel about the work?</span> <span id="s1394">I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">A: Well, sometimes it was kind of difficult to go against your own and for the Germans, but this wa-was not the war any more.</span> <span id="s1396">That was freedom, that was a free country and a perpetrator is a perpetrator and consequently, you -- you don’t feel guilty about sending them to jail.</span> <span id="s1397">Also, very few of them went to jail.</span> <span id="s1398">Many of them were kept in a -- in a camp jail for a few weeks, few months, but they were not sent to German prisons.</span> <span id="s1399">And there were some very humorous things occasionally, like for instance, a group of boys went and they stole a cow.</span> <span id="s1400">And they made the cow walk to the fifth floor, into the attic.</span> <span id="s1401">They slaughtered it and were selling the meat.</span> <span id="s1402">Somebody reported them and of course, I was assigned to it.</span> <span id="s1403">I grabbed three policemen and we went up and we looked and we searched the whole block, we couldn’t find it.</span> <span id="s1404">Then we went with an attic -- in the attic and sure, there was a whole lot of meat still left, a lot of bones.</span> <span id="s1405">“How did you get the cow up here?”</span> <span id="s1406">“Well, she walked up the steps.”</span> <span id="s1407">And later on, when I interrogated that [indecipherable] perpetrators, said, “Well, I didn’t see the cow.</span> <span id="s1408">The cow just came to a block, walked up the steps.</span> <span id="s1409">I couldn’t make her go down, so I had to kill her.</span> <span id="s1410">And why waste all that good meat after I killed her?</span> <span id="s1411">I got to do something.</span> <span id="s1412">I couldn’t eat it all -- all by myself, so I had to sell some.”</span> <span id="s1413">We heard many tall stories.</span> <span id="s1414">And that was the tallest story ever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">Q: Wh-What happened to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">A: He -- He got two -- two weeks in -- in camp prison, but he was released second day and made hard labor, chopping wood in the wood barn.</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">Q: Can you talk a little bit more about making that transition from being in the war time, to actually then going against your own, as you said, or actually working with the Germans?</span> <span id="s1418">How did you make that transition in your mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">A: Well, we actually, we never worked with the Germans.</span> <span id="s1420">It was within the camp, working with the old people, the administration of the camp was Polish.</span> <span id="s1421">The police was Polish.</span> <span id="s1422">The hospital doctors, medical people were Polish.</span> <span id="s1423">So, you kind of worked against the element -- disruptive element in a camp that rest of the people did not approve of.</span> <span id="s1424">Thiefs and robbers and there were a whole lot of -- well, quite a few cases of fathers abusing their daughters.</span> <span id="s1425">Quite a few.</span> <span id="s1426">Quite, quite a few.</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">Q: How would you hear about those?</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">A: Well, felt horrible.</span> <span id="s1429">Matter of fact --</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">Q: How --</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">A: Oh, how you heard --</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">Q: How did you hear about them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">A: People tell stories.</span> <span id="s1434">In a close community, people know everybody’s else’s sins.</span> <span id="s1435">Somebody would get mad with that person, report him and you went and called him in and if he didn’t want to come, you sent a uniformed policeman to bring him in.</span> <span id="s1436">You talk to him, question him.</span> <span id="s1437">Eventually, he would -- people have need to confess in many cases.</span> <span id="s1438">Many of them would confess.</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">Q: Is that something that in a small village in Poland, people would have reported on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">A: They -- They might --</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">Q: A -- an abuse of a -- of a daughter?</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">A: They might have, but I had never -- never heard of an incident.</span> <span id="s1443">Never heard of an incident back -- it must have existed, because in any community, things like this do exist.</span> <span id="s1444">But, it was never reported, it was never disclosed.</span> <span id="s1445">I never heard of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">Q: So what would happen in a case like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">A: Well, he would get a jail sentence.</span> <span id="s1448">In some cases, they would be se -- he would be sent to a German prison.</span> <span id="s1449">There was one father that I had a case of, he was sent to a German prison for five years, but they let him out after one year.</span> <span id="s1450">Matter of fact, his daughter came to America.</span> <span id="s1451">I think is still living in Minneapolis, was a beautiful girl.</span> <span id="s1452">Married somebody here, wer -- lived happily ever after.</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">Q: Were there trials or was it decided more amongst the police?</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">A: It was a trial.</span> <span id="s1455">The camp administrator was a judge.</span> <span id="s1456">There would be attorneys appointed or else, well, just called on, and there were some attorneys in the camp.</span> <span id="s1457">They were -- would be my old chief -- or chief [indecipherable] instructor in the investigation department, he would -- he would be a prosecutor.</span> <span id="s1458">He was a trained, Polish, pre-war prosecutor.</span> <span id="s1459">Good, old man.</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">Q: Wh-Who was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">A: A goo -- a -- he wa -- I mean, he was a go-good old man.</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">A: His name was Mr. Clem Camage.</span> <span id="s1464">And he talked blue streak and he made a lot of sense always.</span> <span id="s1465">And he -- God, he was old, I don’t know how old he was, 50’s, 60’s, 70’s.</span> <span id="s1466">He was old and he was so proud because he lived with a pretty, young girl and he made her a baby.</span> <span id="s1467">Well, those were times, you know, everybody lived with everybody.</span> <span id="s1468">A lot of men had wives back in Poland, they didn’t intend to go back, so they hitched up with somebody, sometime they did get married, sometime they did not.</span> <span id="s1469">And they lived happily ever after, or for a short while, anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">Q: How many cases did you come across of father - daughter sexual abuse?</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">A: Well, I rememb -- I could recall about s-seven during two years, but personally I had only one case.</span> <span id="s1472">Mr. Psheckfass, who was by that time -- Mr. -- I mean Captain Psheckfass there, commander of the police in Wildeflecken said, “You are too young, you shouldn’t ca -- take cases like this.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">Q: Can you tell us a bit about how you had an opportunity to become a detective?</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1475">It cas -- kind of happen almost by it’s own violition.</span> <span id="s1476">It -- they had a group of detectives, some were trained, some untrained.</span> <span id="s1477">So, then Mr. Clem Camage looked once and he said, “Why don’t you come to my lectures?</span> <span id="s1478">Why don’t you stay after work to my lectures?”</span> <span id="s1479">I stayed a few times and I listened.</span> <span id="s1480">And he said, “Wouldn’t you like to work as an investigator?”</span> <span id="s1481">I said, “Well gee, sounds interesting.”</span> <span id="s1482">So I kind of drifted into it.</span> <span id="s1483">And then especially, shortly after I drifted into it, the CIC people came and talked to me, asked me if I would like to work part time for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">Q: This is the United States counterintelligent corps?</span> <span id="s1485">A: Yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">Q: How -- can you tell us about that meeting, the first time you met those people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">A: They cames frequently to the camp and whenever they came, they came to the police office -- offices and walked around and talked to various people.</span> <span id="s1488">They had some business occasionally.</span> <span id="s1489">Sometime they had no business, just came socially and one time Captain Vulcanovsky came to my room to -- well, they were -- my room, it were three of us in that room, three detectives and I was questioning somebody.</span> <span id="s1490">So I stopped and he said, “Nevermind, nevermind, I’ll just sit here, keep talking.”</span> <span id="s1491">So I kept talking and then after I had that person sign his testimony -- I think it was a witness -- and leave, and said, “Would you like to work for us?”</span> <span id="s1492">“Doing what?”</span> <span id="s1493">“Well, you know, catching the German criminals -- Nazi criminals and questioning them, would you like to help us?”</span> <span id="s1494">“Of course, but only part time, cause I’m working full time here, I get paid here.”</span> <span id="s1495">“Okay, I’ll call on you.”</span> <span id="s1496">So, every fi -- week, every two weeks, they would take me away for a day or two.</span> <span id="s1497">I would get the permission from Mr. -- Captain Psheckfass to go.</span> <span id="s1498">And sometime was on -- sneaking to East Germany and bringing back somebody or another.</span> <span id="s1499">Sometime it was interrogation.</span> <span id="s1500">Some of the -- who were questioned, were of Polish German -- so Polish descent, so they gave me those especially to -- to question.</span> <span id="s1501">So I would spend five, eight, 10 - 15, up to about 20 hours talking to them and, “Well, you know, your method works.”</span> <span id="s1502">“Of course it does.”</span> <span id="s1503">Give them lot of water or coffee.</span> <span id="s1504">Don’t let him go to the bathroom for the duration.</span> <span id="s1505">Let -- let him do what he has to do right where he sits, he will tell you everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">Q: That was your method?</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">A: That was my method.</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">Q: And where had you learned that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">A: Well, two guesses.</span> <span id="s1510">Gestapo.</span> <span id="s1511">Cause the Gestapo beat me, too.</span> <span id="s1512">We were not allowed to touch those people.</span> <span id="s1513">Don’t let him sleep for a couple days, then I’ll come and talk to him.</span> <span id="s1514">Take his belt off, whenever he gets up, his pants fall down.</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">Q: Can you tell us about going into East Germany and bringing someone back?</span> <span id="s1516">How -- How did you know who to bring back and how did you do it?</span> <span id="s1517">Did you have a weapon with you?</span> <span id="s1518">How did that work?</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">A: Yes, w-we -- we went -- went in armed.</span> <span id="s1520">We’d normally drive to the border at nightfall and walk across.</span> <span id="s1521">And they knew who they were looking for.</span> <span id="s1522">They had intelligence in East Germany.</span> <span id="s1523">Sometime they would legally drive into East Germany and bring somebody across.</span> <span id="s1524">Or go and talk to that person and tell him that, “You will be taken to West Germany, do you want to go willingly?”</span> <span id="s1525">Many of them went willingly, because by that time, life in East Germany was bad.</span> <span id="s1526">In West Germany was wor -- bad, but better.</span> <span id="s1527">And some who didn’t want to go, were kind of encouraged to go.</span> <span id="s1528">Hom -- some who refused to go, next day somebody would be sent to shoot them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">Q: How did that work?</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">A: Well, I -- I was not asked to go and shoot.</span> <span id="s1531">Anyway, I heard -- if it was true or not, but I heard that.</span> <span id="s1532">Captain Vulcanovsky would come in, “Oh, that so and so that we went to talk didn’t want to come.”</span> <span id="s1533">And I say, “Yeah, I remember him.”</span> <span id="s1534">“Well, you can say a prayer for him.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">Q: And who were -- who were these people mostly?</span> <span id="s1536">What -- what were they wanted for?</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">A: They were SS guards, they were co -- gareekt -- court judges.</span> <span id="s1538">You know, they had Na-Nazis appoin-appointed volk gareekt judges -- anybody, picked them up to -- to give death sentences.</span> <span id="s1539">Anybody who comes, death sentence, death sentence or concentration camp, whatever.</span> <span id="s1540">They were just local, rabid Nazis who judged people for almost anything, any little trespass.</span> <span id="s1541">If you were foreign worker, you -- they would sent you to concentration camp or have you hunged.</span> <span id="s1542">If you went to -- slept -- if a German woman encouraged young Polish or Russian boy to sleep with her, it was found out, death sentence immediately.</span> <span id="s1543">Took him out and hunged him on the nearest tree.</span> <span id="s1544">But it had to be cour-court case in a gareekt loytemp people -- people would mete out death sentences.</span> <span id="s1545">So, many of those were apprehended and information on them collected.</span> <span id="s1546">And some of them were de-Nazified, th-they were interrogated and found that they were not really great perpetrators, they were just mitlowfers or kind of helpers uppers, but not really criminals, and let out.</span> <span id="s1547">And all of them were glad to stay in West Germany.</span> <span id="s1548">But some were sent to prisons, went through court system.</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">Q: And tell us a little bit about the experience of sitting across from some of these people who were SS guards or -- or judges, who’d had a part in the violence and oppression that you experienced, what was it like to sit across from them and ask them questions?</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">A: Well you -- you tried to question this person as a person, but you felt about him like a vermin.</span> <span id="s1551">In my case, I knew what happened -- what was done to me by mine interrogator and two or three of his henchmen, who beat the bijesus out of me.</span> <span id="s1552">And you -- you could see that those people might have done, so you question them and question them and question them and if there were any witnesses, you questioned the witnesses and you confronted them with the witnesses and you felt like bashing their heads in, but of course, you were not allowed to touch them, so you kept them for 18 hours talking and you give them a lot to drink and, “I want to go to the bathroom.”</span> <span id="s1553">“Forget it.</span> <span id="s1554">You go to the bathroom when I tell you to go to the bathroom.”</span> <span id="s1555">It didn’t feel so great.</span> <span id="s1556">You didn’t feel good humiliating them, but you felt like doing it.</span> <span id="s1557">You felt like that was your duty to -- to really find out if he is innocent or if he really was guilty and if turned out that he really couldn’t prove anything against him, that you felt bad because you mistreated the person.</span> <span id="s1558">You made him wet his pants many times when he sat in the front of you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">Q: Was it something that you wanted to continue doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">A: An -- I did not want to do it again, ever, in my life.</span> <span id="s1561">But at that time, I was interested in it.</span> <span id="s1562">I wanted to do it and mainly I wanted to help, to weed out those who were real henchmen, murderers, criminals, who would -- who should not be fr -- walking free.</span> <span id="s1563">But, of course, the sentences they received were just nothing.</span> <span id="s1564">Four years, five years, 10 years.</span> <span id="s1565">He would serve 12 months and would be released in a good behavior.</span> <span id="s1566">It was just -- I mean, it was almost -- almost a joke.</span> <span id="s1567">But, we thought, well, at least something, at least -- at least something.</span> <span id="s1568">There’s going -- going to be a black mark on his documents and he would not be allowed to perform within the population.</span> <span id="s1569">For instance, getting -- be-becoming important person, or -- or getting a job.</span> <span id="s1570">Forget it.</span> <span id="s1571">Every one of them got a good job later on.</span> <span id="s1572">They helped one another.</span> <span id="s1573">One did get in, he pulled all 10 of them in.</span> <span id="s1574">There were a lot of German police in the German army -- West German army.</span> <span id="s1575">There were a lot in -- in -- in -- in intelligence, a lot of former perpetrators were with Gellen in -- outside of Frankfort, helping Americans against the Soviets.</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">Q: How did this affect or shape your idea of justice after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1577">A: I was quite skeptical.</span> <span id="s1578">First I thought we are performing great service and kind of making them pay.</span> <span id="s1579">Later on, it became a big joke and you became skeptical.</span> <span id="s1580">But things of the world are as they are.</span> <span id="s1581">It is next to impossible to punish somebody for crimes -- cruelty, or else whatever they did.</span> <span id="s1582">It was next impossible of punishing them, except sending them to the holy inquisition.</span> <span id="s1583">Putting them in a wheel to stretch their arms, break their joints and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s1584">And of course, nobody was allowed to do that.</span> <span id="s1585">There was one American, Captain Bollack, he was from Hammtrack, Michigan.</span> <span id="s1586">He would get occasionally short tempered and he would hit wildly.</span> <span id="s1587">But after one or two times, I didn’t want to be with him any more and when he -- when I interrogated somebody, I ask him, “Please, Captain Bollack, don’t come.”</span> <span id="s1588">Because he would hit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">Q: Was -- how did you come to a decision that you didn’t want to hit?</span> <span id="s1590">Because certainly, in your first interview, you told the story about coming across your German interrogator, and you could have hit him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">A: I could have, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">Q: Ho-How did you come to that decision, if you could talk a bit about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">A: Well, I cou -- looked at him -- him, I looked at myself.</span> <span id="s1594">He was a big, strong man.</span> <span id="s1595">I was a little, tiny sprout.</span> <span id="s1596">And him mistreated me as he -- as he did, I said, “Do -- Do I want to be like you were?</span> <span id="s1597">I don’t.”</span> <span id="s1598">So, when I questioned him, he said, “Well, I was doing my job.”</span> <span id="s1599">“Did you have to do what you did to me?”</span> <span id="s1600">“Well, I was doing my job.”</span> <span id="s1601">So, he say, “If you have to do your job, you can do it to me anything you want to.”</span> <span id="s1602">Yeah, he was quite resigned by then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">Q: This was Hans Christian.</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">A: Yes, Hans Christian [indecipherable] name Mr. Meyer, or whatever he called himself.</span> <span id="s1605">I don’t even know if his na -- real name was Hans Christian, but I did find his transcript of his Ph.D. degree at the -- at the Heidelberg University.</span> <span id="s1606">He had a Ph.D. in criminal justice and Ph.D. in Christian theology.</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">Q: Okay, let’s see.</span> <span id="s1608">So how long did you do the work for the counterintelligence corps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1609">A: From 1940 -- early ‘48 through 1949, until I left in September for America.</span> <span id="s1610">About -- almost two years.</span> <span id="s1611">Maybe little less than two years, maybe a little more then two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">Q: I want to ask you something about the camp and people’s sexual behavior, really.</span> <span id="s1613">You had mentioned the -- the former prostitutes, but that they were under control.</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">A: Oh, were they ever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">Q: And then you mentioned that people were living together and then you mentioned the fathers abusing the daughters.</span> <span id="s1616">And I guess what I’d like you to talk a little bit about is, what was the atmosphere generally?</span> <span id="s1617">People’s sexual behavior in the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">A: It wasn’t any worse than it was in a -- in normal, general population.</span> <span id="s1619">At the beginning maybe it was little worse, because there were a lot of young, unattached people who paired on and paired off, but the influence of the Catholic church was very strong in the camp.</span> <span id="s1620">There were priests, there were chapels, there were churches.</span> <span id="s1621">And people went to Confession, people went to Communion.</span> <span id="s1622">People went to Mass.</span> <span id="s1623">Hardly anybody ever missed a Mass, except some hooligans who thought the -- there was few concentration -- former concentration camp inmates who lost belief in God, because they said, “If something like this happened, God does not exist.”</span> <span id="s1624">But very, very few, so it wasn’t much worse than anywhere else.</span> <span id="s1625">And, since li -- people lived in such a close proximity, you know, five, six, seven, well, the room I was in was smaller than this room.</span> <span id="s1626">One room, there were five of us living in it.</span> <span id="s1627">Some-Sometime 11 people lived in a room -- room of this size.</span> <span id="s1628">Everybody knew everything about everybody else.</span> <span id="s1629">So, if something happens, well, watch out, you get deported and a priest would come to talk to you and say, “You inferial so and so, you better not do it.”</span> <span id="s1630">Well, some people lived together and it was -- that was kind of almost semi-accepted.</span> <span id="s1631">They are lonely, they have nobody else, they have somebody to take care of them.</span> <span id="s1632">And many people who were supposed to be leaders or else people to give good example, or people to enforce the proper behavior, did not behave properly themselves.</span> <span id="s1633">Like my immediate superior of a investigation department, a judge Clem Camage, he lived with a pretty, young girl and they had a baby and he was so damn proud of that baby.</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">End of Tape Three, Side B Beginning Tape Four, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Stefan Czyzewski.</span> <span id="s1636">This is tape number four, side A.</span> <span id="s1637">Did you live with anybody?</span></p> <p><span id="s1638">A: I didn’t.</span> <span id="s1639">Sorry to say.</span> <span id="s1640">I was extremely fond of many girls.</span> <span id="s1641">I fell in love with a French doctor -- lady doctor, who was my doctor.</span> <span id="s1642">Beautiful, young girl who just got out of medical school.</span> <span id="s1643">She volunteered to go and she was in Forheim sanitorium, she was my doctor.</span> <span id="s1644">We became very friendly, she -- we went on a trip, she me -- requisitioned a Jeep.</span> <span id="s1645">We went to see her family, stayed for a week, 10 days in Versailles, outside of Paris, saw the sights, came back.</span> <span id="s1646">When I went to a different sanitorium, well, she came to see me a few times, but nothing developed.</span> <span id="s1647">And, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1648">All my childhood, I always was very fond of girls, just extremely fond of girls.</span> <span id="s1649">I always had three steady ones and maybe two extra.</span> <span id="s1650">After the war, I was, for a long -- some time, very friendly with a Russian girl, then I was quite friendly with the Italian girl.</span> <span id="s1651">Then, when I came to Wildeflecken, a lady secretary in the next office, said, “Banya Stefanya, why don’t you come and visit us?”</span> <span id="s1652">“Well, I’ll be glad to visit you, but why should I come and visit you?”</span> <span id="s1653">“Well, I have a beautiful daughter.”</span> <span id="s1654">“Oh, when do I come?”</span> <span id="s1655">So, of course it was -- it -- Good Friday came and she said, “Well, why don’t you come tomorrow?</span> <span id="s1656">Have a light lunch after work, we leave at noon.</span> <span id="s1657">And so we can go to visit the -- the tomb,” you know, we’re going into the church and -- and praying in the front of the effigy of -- of Christ.</span> <span id="s1658">“We can have lunch and you -- you and Hanka can -- Hanka can go and visit the tombs.”</span> <span id="s1659">So I went and visit the -- I had a li-light lunch and I went with Hanka to -- to visit the …</span></p> <p><span id="s1660">Q: I guess -- I want to ask this.</span> <span id="s1661">I -- I’ve read about the camps and in some cases, people are really just sitting and waiting.</span> <span id="s1662">However, speaking to you, you are so engaged with your life, the immediate life that’s around you.</span> <span id="s1663">You’re working and you’re -- you’re being promoted from a stenographer to a detective.</span> <span id="s1664">How did you feel at that time about your life and what -- what was ma -- what you were maybe going to end up doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">A: I felt very lucky to be able what I did.</span> <span id="s1666">And apparently, people who -- people who helped me apparently thought that I was worth a little.</span> <span id="s1667">Also, it will probably seem pathetic, because those two people who helped me the most, spent time in a concentration camp also, or else a prisoner’s of war camp and those two people, Captain Psheckfass and Mr. Shimienski, who was a camp commander -- police commander in Ashafenberg and also worked in a policer in Wildeflecken, was very sympathetic and very helpful.</span> <span id="s1668">Later on, when I got to know Lieutenant Penjik, he also helped me survive in the -- in the police department.</span> <span id="s1669">He was one of the dignitaries there who did not very much, but was a very elegant person, a well-spoken person.</span> <span id="s1670">The drinkit -- drinkest person I ever met and we were very close friends and they always thought, “That little boy, I got to help him.”</span> <span id="s1671">And they did.</span> <span id="s1672">So I felt very fortunate and I tried to do my best whe -- in whatever I did and in most cases, apparently succeeded because I was never canned.</span> <span id="s1673">I was never fired.</span> <span id="s1674">I was called on the carpet from time to time and told what should not be done and what should be done, but never was really punished, as my document states.</span> <span id="s1675">He is going to United States and he was never punished, except before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1676">Q: When you look back at your time, particularly as in the underground, how do you account for your choices?</span> <span id="s1677">Your choices which were almost instinctively to fight and resist, versus just obeying the Germans or trying to wait it out.</span> <span id="s1678">How do you account for those choices you made?</span></p> <p><span id="s1679">A: Well, I thought that -- I thought it was inborn, because all my forefathers were fighters and active.</span> <span id="s1680">I had a grand-grand-grandfather who fought the Soviet -- the Soviet -- the Russian Souse regime and ended in say -- with a death sentence and later on was commuted to 25 years in Siberia.</span> <span id="s1681">I had people who fought with the Polish legion during Napoleonic wars.</span> <span id="s1682">I had forefathers who had served in diplomatic service and were active.</span> <span id="s1683">I had my father, who wore -- fought in the first World War on three fronts.</span> <span id="s1684">He fought with the Russians against the Prussians and with the Prussians against the French, with the -- with the French and Polish against the Germans.</span> <span id="s1685">So I guess, if it wasn’t inborn, at least I could think back about it and act accordingly.</span> <span id="s1686">Didn’t want to be bystander.</span> <span id="s1687">And of course, my ego was enormous.</span> <span id="s1688">I knew I could do almost anything, and went and most of the time I didn’t, sometime I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">Q: An-And if you could talk a little bit about the Polish culture in terms of how to react to authority.</span> <span id="s1690">A German survivor -- I read that she said as a German, she just -- just obeyed when they -- when the SS told her to do something, she did it and she -- she went to camp and she never considered saying no.</span> <span id="s1691">What about the Polish culture and -- and within your own family, what kind of things were you taught?</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">A: Polish people in the first place, are very contrary.</span> <span id="s1693">Also very disputatious.</span> <span id="s1694">You would say -- have four Poles dis-discussing certain set of ideas.</span> <span id="s1695">They would have seven ideas and nobody gives.</span> <span id="s1696">Consequently, when we get hit, we hit back hard.</span> <span id="s1697">Poland, in history, was overran many times by neighbors who were 10 times more powerful.</span> <span id="s1698">Poland was divided and subdivided by three neighbors who were -- each one was three times as big as Poland and being under occupation of Prussia, Austria and Russia, Poland had, oh my God, probably half a dozen really heavy uprisings and probably dozen and a half of smaller uprisings.</span> <span id="s1699">They were being killed, they were being hung, they were drowned, they were sent to Siberia.</span> <span id="s1700">They were -- spent time in Magdaburg -- German citadel prison.</span> <span id="s1701">Polish -- creator of Polish state, after first World War, Marshall Pisoutski spent couple years in a German prison in Madgaburg.</span> <span id="s1702">So, we kind of thought that we are the fighting people and we tried to prove it.</span> <span id="s1703">Most of the time we did not succeed, at times we did.</span> <span id="s1704">That was probably kind of loyalty to -- to your state, loyalty to your nation, especially, and acting upon it.</span> <span id="s1705">And probably most of the -- most of it is that we are qu -- we were quite foolhardy.</span> <span id="s1706">When I corresponded with my first cousin, who spent about 10 years in a Communist prison -- after she was released, we wrote to each other before she died.</span> <span id="s1707">I said, “Well gee, why didn’t you go out and fight [indecipherable]” And she said, “We have grown now.</span> <span id="s1708">We want to conduct ourself properly, we want to go by vote, we want to go and work hard and perhaps we will succeed.</span> <span id="s1709">We must have grown.”</span> <span id="s1710">Well, when I knew Poland and when I knew myself and my se -- environment during the war and before the war, looks like we have not grown yet, we just went and hid and fight -- and fought.</span></p> <p><span id="s1711">Q: I want you to think back to the point when you were in the dis -- in -- in Wildeflecken and when you found out -- no, let me ask you this first, why did you want to emigrate to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">A: For the simple reason that, as I mentioned before, that was a seventh heaven.</span> <span id="s1713">And everybody wanted to go to America.</span> <span id="s1714">And I had had friends -- close friends and the wife of the family worked for the emigration office to America and he hel -- she helped to put me on the list.</span> <span id="s1715">And eventually my name came, my number came, I was called in and was asked to collect documentation and went through the doctors and -- and all kind of commissions, question this and question that, went through the consulate.</span> <span id="s1716">Especially I had a hard time with a doctor or else I didn’t have a hard time with a doctor, but Captain Vulcanovsky said, “Well, you have -- your lungs are scarred.</span> <span id="s1717">You’ll never go to America.</span> <span id="s1718">Come on, let’s have your documents.”</span> <span id="s1719">So he took my little card with the x-ray on it and he said, “Here, stick this one on.”</span> <span id="s1720">“What is that?”</span> <span id="s1721">“This is my x-ray, I never had any problem with lungs.”</span> <span id="s1722">That was it, I came under false pretenses.</span> <span id="s1723">I came here as a former tuberculosis patient, almost dying there and I haven’t been sick a day since I came here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">Q: But your captain put his picture?</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">A: His -- His x-ray --</span></p> <p><span id="s1726">Q: Instead of yours?</span></p> <p><span id="s1727">A: Instead of mine.</span> <span id="s1728">Even though they still -- there was still that little typed line that I could not -- I could not launder.</span> <span id="s1729">It says, “Pleveredes maxudatevair.”</span> <span id="s1730">So then doctor -- American doctor looks and say, “You had the Pleveredes maxudatevair here.</span> <span id="s1731">How come your lungs are so clear?”</span> <span id="s1732">I said, “Oh, it cleared up.”</span> <span id="s1733">And he said, “Okay.”</span> <span id="s1734">I understood the okay.</span> <span id="s1735">He spoke to the interpreter and my English was kind of a little --</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">Q: So without that clear x-ray, you wouldn’t have been able to come?</span></p> <p><span id="s1737">A: Possibly not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1738">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1739">A: I may -- there might have been special -- certain consideration, because the CIC people said, “If any problems you have, just call us and we’ll come and round those bureaucrats down.”</span> <span id="s1740">But possibly I could [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1741">Americans at that time were deathly afraid of tuberculosis.</span></p> <p><span id="s1742">Q: Who paid for you to come?</span></p> <p><span id="s1743">A: Government funds paid for the crossing of the ocean.</span> <span id="s1744">We came on a troop ship.</span> <span id="s1745">Troop ship that normally took about 400 people, had 17 people -- hundred people on board.</span> <span id="s1746">Were kind of --</span></p> <p><span id="s1747">Q: 1700?</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">A: 1700.</span> <span id="s1749">And our trip from New York to Saint Paul, Minneapolis was paid by U.S. Catholic Conference.</span> <span id="s1750">Later, I repaid them.</span> <span id="s1751">Later, I called on the -- on the Immigration Department and ask me -- asked if I could repay the trip -- the trip across the ocean, they said, “Forget it.</span> <span id="s1752">U.S. governor paid for it, you are going to pay in taxes.”</span> <span id="s1753">So when I worked the first three months in that year and I never had anybody do my tax return, I did it myself.</span> <span id="s1754">I did it with a dictionary and things and I put a wrong word there on the first tax return.</span> <span id="s1755">There was a clause that said, “Do you owe any taxes for the previous years?”</span> <span id="s1756">I said, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s1757">I was getting official letters for months and years.</span> <span id="s1758">“We have searched and we cannot find that you owe any taxes, can you enlighten us?”</span> <span id="s1759">It finally dawned upon me what I did and I wrote a great letter of pol -- of apology.</span> <span id="s1760">I said I was a greenhorn, I did it all by myself and I made a mistake.</span> <span id="s1761">Because, you know, working only three months in that year, I got all my taxes back.</span> <span id="s1762">But I made a mistake that I owe taxes for the previous years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1763">Q: Tell us the name of the ship that you came on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1764">A: General Hersey -- Hersey.</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">Q: Can you tell us where it docked -- where it came into port in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1766">A: Yeah, it started from Bremenhoffen in Germany.</span> <span id="s1767">Oh, I’m sorry, started in Hamburg Altoona.</span> <span id="s1768">We were going to Bremenhoffen, but we did not, we can -- started from Altoona and it came to New York and docked just close to the Statue of Liberty, I had some pictures made of it in a -- in a kind of a hazy light.</span> <span id="s1769">And were processed right in the dock and local Polish committee people took us to the train, we had train tickets.</span> <span id="s1770">I went on a train and got to Chicago.</span> <span id="s1771">From Chicago --</span></p> <p><span id="s1772">Q: Oh, I want to ask -- do you remember co-coming in to -- do you remember New York coming into sight and the Statue of Liberty?</span></p> <p><span id="s1773">A: Yes, it was -- it was just about four in the morning and the Statue of Liberty was kind of visible, you know, in a fog [indecipherable], “Oh, my God, look at that darn thing standing up there.</span> <span id="s1774">Oh, how tall it is, how big it is.”</span> <span id="s1775">But we docked quite a distance from it, that -- the -- I can’t remember what dock it was.</span> <span id="s1776">But we surely saw the Statue of Liberty.</span> <span id="s1777">I have a -- somewhere, a faded picture to prove it, standing on the side of a ship and somebody took my picture with -- with the Statue of Liberty in the background.</span></p> <p><span id="s1778">Q: What were your first impressions of -- of the United States as you came off the boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s1779">A: Oh, the noise.</span> <span id="s1780">A lot of people, traffic.</span> <span id="s1781">Oh my God, the traffic.</span> <span id="s1782">When we -- I think there was a old Polish committee lady who took three of us and I don’t even know which train depot we went to, but oh, the traffic, we were just ogling the traffic and all the -- all of the people on the sidewalks and all those buildings and all this crowdedness.</span> <span id="s1783">But especially all those cars and everybody drives at a breakneck speed and everybody honks their horn.</span> <span id="s1784">It was just flabbergasting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">Q: So someone met you, took you to the train station and put you right on the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s1786">A: Put on the train with a ticket and -- and a tag saying that if -- “This person speaks no English, if you can help him, please do.”</span> <span id="s1787">So of course, pretty soon a pretty, young woman came and sat next to me and she spoke little German.</span> <span id="s1788">Asked me who I was and what I was and we talked blue streak all way to Chicago.</span> <span id="s1789">And then I had a stay over in Chicago, about two hours, so she took -- we -- she was from Hammtrack, Michigan, I -- she -- I think.</span> <span id="s1790">She was changing the trains, too.</span> <span id="s1791">So, she went -- I -- we went out, she bought me a lunch.</span> <span id="s1792">We went walking around and we took a train -- se -- se -- streetcar and we went to a certain direction, came back a different direction.</span> <span id="s1793">And then she put me back on the train and that was it.</span> <span id="s1794">I even have a picture of her somewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s1795">Q: She sort of took you on a mini sightseeing trip?</span></p> <p><span id="s1796">A: She took me on a mini sightseeing.</span> <span id="s1797">It was plump, young lady.</span> <span id="s1798">And I said, “Well, gee, are all American people fat?</span> <span id="s1799">Look at that beautiful, fat lady.”</span> <span id="s1800">And the boys who were with me were so jealous.</span> <span id="s1801">“Gee, why couldn’t she pick me up?</span> <span id="s1802">It’s you, you are nothing.</span> <span id="s1803">I’m a good looking, tall, blonde man, why does she have to pick on you?”</span></p> <p><span id="s1804">Q: Was there a point, or at what point in the trip -- perhaps it was when you were getting on the boat, or you were on the ship coming across the ocean, or somewhere else where you -- it began to sink in that you really were coming to the United States, embarking on a new life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1805">Q: Well, I -- it didn’t come to me until I landed in New York.</span> <span id="s1806">Say, “Oh my God, what I’m going to do this busy country?”</span> <span id="s1807">Before, it was just like a dream, you know, taking off and going somewhere, like flying, you know, bird flying.</span> <span id="s1808">And I looked and I was so lucky because I didn’t get seasick.</span> <span id="s1809">I ate myself sick couple times -- ate myself sick.</span> <span id="s1810">But I wasn’t seasick.</span> <span id="s1811">Everybody was not able to eat and they’re going over -- over the side and doing things and I even got a job.</span> <span id="s1812">I became a typist.</span> <span id="s1813">There was a Polish paper being published on the ship.</span> <span id="s1814">So I typed the art -- somebody dictated, I took shorthand, I typed the copy of it and then corrected it and pretty soon there came a little two page paper for the Polish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1815">Q: Do you have a copy of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1816">A: I don’t.</span> <span id="s1817">I wish I would have kept a copy.</span> <span id="s1818">I did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1819">Q: So, continue telling the story.</span> <span id="s1820">Then you got -- you were in Chicago and you got on another train?</span></p> <p><span id="s1821">A: Chane -- the train came to Saint Paul and there were some people waiting for us from the Polish American club here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1822">Q: You’re still with your two friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s1823">A: Still with my two friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s1824">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1825">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1826">Actually, it was -- one was to disembark in Chicago.</span> <span id="s1827">Another boy was coming here.</span> <span id="s1828">And then we met a lady -- older lady who was coming also here.</span> <span id="s1829">She was a refugee, too.</span> <span id="s1830">So we came to Saint Paul and there were Polish people from the Polish American club.</span> <span id="s1831">And there was an attorney, Mr. Nahourski, who came also that day.</span> <span id="s1832">And one of the Polish people walked me to a barber shop downtown, where my sponsor was a barber.</span> <span id="s1833">It was old Mr. Proekopovich who was my sponsor.</span> <span id="s1834">He was asked -- people were asked by the U.S. Catholic Conference to sponsor certain people.</span> <span id="s1835">So he and his wife signed up [indecipherable] want a young man to stay with them and they would provide you with room and board until you found a job.</span> <span id="s1836">And so I went on a streetcar with Mr. Proekopovich -- no, I’m sorry, he had an old, beaten up jalopy.</span> <span id="s1837">God, was about 20 years old, was falling apart, but he was so proud of his own automobile -- driving.</span> <span id="s1838">I remember his [indecipherable] his knuckles were white on his steering wheel and he was tall and looking straight ahead and driving and honking the horn.</span></p> <p><span id="s1839">Q: And this, what year is this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1840">A: It was in 19 -- in September, 1959.</span></p> <p><span id="s1841">Q: No.</span> <span id="s1842">‘59?</span></p> <p><span id="s1843">A: ‘59.</span></p> <p><span id="s1844">Q: No, no, ‘49.</span></p> <p><span id="s1845">A: I’m sorry, I’m sorry, ‘49.</span> <span id="s1846">Oh my God, 10 years before.</span> <span id="s1847">No, ‘49.</span></p> <p><span id="s1848">Q: September 1949.</span></p> <p><span id="s1849">A: 1949, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1850">Q: Okay, good.</span> <span id="s1851">When you were coming over on the boat, or perhaps on the train, was there talk -- well, what -- what were you talking about with the other refugees?</span></p> <p><span id="s1852">A: We just wondered who we meet, who we are going to stay with.</span> <span id="s1853">The trepidation of -- of -- of not knowing the language too well.</span> <span id="s1854">Also, I could write and read English quite well by then, but before I left, my British girl teacher said, “Well, you are going to America.</span> <span id="s1855">Those people haven’t spoken English for last couple hundred years.</span> <span id="s1856">You will have a hard time with them.”</span> <span id="s1857">I did, for about six months.</span> <span id="s1858">We swallow a lot of suffixes, we don’t enunciate properly.</span> <span id="s1859">We -- We garble sentences, according to the British.</span> <span id="s1860">It took about six months to adjust to American English.</span> <span id="s1861">I still spoke broken English when I met Sylvia.</span> <span id="s1862">Every -- every -- every pot I used to call jar.</span> <span id="s1863">Frying pan and -- and -- and a cooking pot, everything was jar as far I was -- I was concerned.</span></p> <p><span id="s1864">Q: What was your first room like with your sponsor -- your sponsors?</span></p> <p><span id="s1865">A: Well, the lady of the house had a big supper waiting and well, I wasn’t very hungry.</span> <span id="s1866">Also, I hardly ate anything on the train.</span> <span id="s1867">I was given five dollars in New York and I brought the five dollars to Saint Paul.</span> <span id="s1868">The American lady bought me a little lunch and she bought me a sandwich on the train and the little lunch -- I think it was a hamburger that we ate in Chicago.</span> <span id="s1869">And the lady of the house made a big supper.</span> <span id="s1870">Was a meat roast and a lot of potatoes.</span> <span id="s1871">And they had big, black olives.</span> <span id="s1872">And I was sure those were plums, so I took quite a few.</span> <span id="s1873">And I can’t stand olives.</span> <span id="s1874">At that time I didn’t know what olives were.</span> <span id="s1875">I still can’t stand olives.</span> <span id="s1876">And I choked in and ate those three, huge, black olives.</span> <span id="s1877">I just didn’t dare to put them back.</span> <span id="s1878">So I choked them in.</span> <span id="s1879">I almost felt -- I felt sick after eating those -- those -- those big plums.</span></p> <p><span id="s1880">Q: What did they tell you about the country that you had just arrived in?</span> <span id="s1881">What kind of advice did they give you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1882">A: Well, they told me all kind of things.</span> <span id="s1883">“Well, you will be a greenhorn here for a long time.</span> <span id="s1884">People call people like you greenhorn.”</span> <span id="s1885">“What is greenhorn?”</span> <span id="s1886">“Well, you know, jerno nerogie, young bullock with -- with green horns.</span> <span id="s1887">And they will call you names, they will call you Polack, they will call you this, they will call you that.</span> <span id="s1888">But lo -- don’t let it worry you.</span> <span id="s1889">Most of them are quite stupid people.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1890">Q: They said that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1891">A: They said that, yes.</span> <span id="s1892">Like, “Most people are stupid.</span> <span id="s1893">Those who will call you names are stupid people, so don’t pay attention to them.</span> <span id="s1894">The people who know, won’t bother you.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1895">Q: And can you tell us about what you did then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1896">A: Well I -- I was in with them for about three, four days and I cleaned up and washed up the whole basement.</span> <span id="s1897">It was just reconverted from coal to oil heat.</span> <span id="s1898">And I whitewashed it and I washed and took all the rust off the old car and repainted and repolished it.</span> <span id="s1899">It was gleaming like a -- like a newly born baby.</span> <span id="s1900">And I mow the grass and I made my 50 -- first 50 cents.</span> <span id="s1901">Next door lady was cleaning a house.</span> <span id="s1902">I went, help her clean it up and I took her carpets out and put them on a fence and beat the carpets and I made whole 50 cents, big 50 cents piece.</span> <span id="s1903">And my neighbor was a post -- mailman.</span> <span id="s1904">And he was making the lordly sum of 50 dollars a week.</span> <span id="s1905">And I said, “Oh my God, if I ever make 50 dollars a week in America, I will never want any more.”</span> <span id="s1906">Ha.</span> <span id="s1907">And then, about a week later, I met -- well, few days later I went to Polish American club and made -- make -- made-- met some local people.</span> <span id="s1908">There was one person who said, “Well, I’ll take you with me.</span> <span id="s1909">Come tomorrow morning.”</span> <span id="s1910">So he took me to his factory.</span> <span id="s1911">It was a cabinet shop.</span> <span id="s1912">It was a casket company.</span> <span id="s1913">He said, “Ernie, the man who owns it and runs it, is an old Deutschman, so I’ll let you talk to him.”</span> <span id="s1914">So I went and spoke to Ernie, who was a Mr. Rife, a very dignified old gentleman.</span> <span id="s1915">And he asked me if I spoke German.</span> <span id="s1916">“Selps forshtanley, I speak Deutsch, I speak Deutsch.”</span> <span id="s1917">So we talked.</span> <span id="s1918">He said, “Well, actually, I don’t have a job here for you, but you just come, I’ll give you a job.”</span> <span id="s1919">[indecipherable] workers having do a certain kind of work here, which it was -- I sta -- “Just come to me every noon on your lunch hour and we’ll talk German.”</span> <span id="s1920">So, we went every hou -- every lunch I went to his office, which was like a museum and we talk German and pretty soon I -- they found me something to do and I stayed there until the place closed, which was about a year later.</span> <span id="s1921">He employed people -- some of his people in their -- in their 70’s and 80’s, who slept most of the time, didn’t produce very much.</span> <span id="s1922">So, the place got broke.</span></p> <p><span id="s1923">End of Tape Four, Side A Beginning Tape Four, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1924">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Stefan Czyzewski.</span> <span id="s1925">This is tape number four, side B.</span></p> <p><span id="s1926">A: So Mr. Rife, after he closed the place, he kept the superintendent there, and me for about six more months, liquidating the place.</span> <span id="s1927">We were cleaning up, taking stuff out.</span> <span id="s1928">He had in his office a Indian and first American artifacts, probably more than the Science Museum had in Minnesota.</span> <span id="s1929">So he donated most of the stuff there and some of it he took to his ranch that he had in Wisconsin, or to his big home in north Saint Paul.</span> <span id="s1930">And eventually he had to let me go and gave me a memento or two.</span> <span id="s1931">So that was my first job.</span></p> <p><span id="s1932">Q: And then what did you do?</span> <span id="s1933">Did you [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1934">A: And then --</span></p> <p><span id="s1935">Q: How old were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1936">A: I was in my mid-twenties that time.</span> <span id="s1937">25 - 26?</span> <span id="s1938">Then I found a job, I became a gandy dancer on a railroad.</span> <span id="s1939">I worked there for almost a -- about a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s1940">Q: Remind us what a gandy dancer does?</span></p> <p><span id="s1941">A: Gandy dancer is the person who fixes up the track when you lay a new tie under the rail, it is loose.</span> <span id="s1942">So you keep pouring crushed rock and keep -- and you put your heavy shovel among the crushed rock and you hold it up or top with your hands -- the top of the shovel.</span> <span id="s1943">And you put your foot on the shovel down below and press on it and you rock back and forth, back and forth, pushing the stone under the tie, so eventually the tie becomes tight against the rail.</span> <span id="s1944">So people doing this kind of work were called gandy dancers.</span> <span id="s1945">I was a gandy dancer on a railroad section for almost a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s1946">Q: Did you like that work?</span></p> <p><span id="s1947">A: I didn’t dislike it.</span> <span id="s1948">It was healthy, it was outdoors.</span> <span id="s1949">Although, when Minnesota winter came, it was a little oppressive.</span> <span id="s1950">When I was coming to Minnesota, I thought it was wine country, because Minnesota in the same parallel that is Matz in France, which is a wine -- wine -- Champagne country.</span> <span id="s1951">When I came here, I found Minnesota to be identical to Poland.</span> <span id="s1952">Same summer, same winter except in Minnesota, winter is month and a half longer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1953">Q: How did you feel?</span> <span id="s1954">Did -- were you making friends or did you feel isolated at all in those first two years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1955">A: No, I didn’t feel isolated at all, because all the newcomers are going once a ni -- week -- a night -- one night a week to the International Institute, which is in -- well, it’s kind of all over the United States, who teaches English to foreign born and helps them to gain citizenship if they’re interested.</span> <span id="s1956">So then I met a lot of Polish Ukrainian Russian boys and girls who came almost the same time or just about that time.</span> <span id="s1957">Many of them bought cars, so we would go get into cars and we would go to the park and play tennis and go swimming and go girls -- girls chasing and do all kind of guy stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s1958">Q: And how did people in the city treat you?</span> <span id="s1959">Americans in general?</span> <span id="s1960">You were someone who didn’t speak English fluently at this point.</span> <span id="s1961">Did you ever feel unwanted?</span> <span id="s1962">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s1963">No, sometime I felt intimidated.</span> <span id="s1964">But I haven’t met anybody who would misstate me.</span> <span id="s1965">My boss at work in the casket company would call me, “Hey you, greenhorn, come on here.</span> <span id="s1966">Do this and do that.”</span> <span id="s1967">But he was kind of a tough fellow, but he was goodhearted.</span> <span id="s1968">Next hour, he would come and give me half of his sandwich and say, “Come on, hide over there and eat it, because you look hungry and you so skinny.</span> <span id="s1969">Why don’t you eat some more?”</span> <span id="s1970">And I never felt mistreated by anybody.</span> <span id="s1971">Later on, when I developed -- learned my halfway decent English and did get my present job, I felt, you know, good about myself, because there were people who did not have as good a job as I had, even though I was always paid poorly and still am.</span> <span id="s1972">But I did not make here to make fortune.</span> <span id="s1973">I came here to gain freedom.</span> <span id="s1974">I wake up in the morning and I think about it, I say, “Man, I feel so free.”</span> <span id="s1975">Which I do.</span> <span id="s1976">And say a prayer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1977">Q: How often d-do you have a flashback to the war and to the time that you didn’t have your freedom?</span></p> <p><span id="s1978">A: Occasionally, but very seldom.</span> <span id="s1979">Occasionally when I -- I do go and give talks to schools -- high schools, colleges and places -- groups of people, I’ll talk about the Holocaust -- about the war time, and so on.</span> <span id="s1980">I have flashes occasionally after that, and that -- until we met last time in May, whenever I went to give a talk, I had some sleepless nights after that, you know, the things were coming back.</span> <span id="s1981">But when we talked for six and a half or seven hours last May, I said, “Oh my God, I won’t be able to sleep for next two weeks.”</span> <span id="s1982">You know, I slept like a log.</span> <span id="s1983">It must have been therapeutic.</span> <span id="s1984">And things hardly ever flash back.</span> <span id="s1985">Occasionally -- occasionally, I think about people who were worthy of survival, worthy of a good life, but did not make it.</span> <span id="s1986">A lot of them.</span> <span id="s1987">There were a lot of people who were better than I and they were worthy people, educated people, great people even.</span> <span id="s1988">They couldn’t make it.</span> <span id="s1989">I frequently think of those people and frequently say a prayer for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1990">Q: Are the feelings guilt feelings that you made it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1991">A: At times I feel guilty.</span> <span id="s1992">At times I feel [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1993">I should have helped that one, that time, I should have helped this one, this time.</span> <span id="s1994">Was I able to help him?</span> <span id="s1995">Was I able to help him without forfeiting my life?</span> <span id="s1996">At [indecipherable] I think that I could have and I didn’t and I do feel guilty about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1997">Q: But when you said you wake up and you think about freedom, that is something that you think of every day, but that is not necessarily in relation to your lack of freedom, it’s just that you’re aware of having freedom when you wake up now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1998">A: Very much so, yes.</span> <span id="s1999">I felt a [indecipherable] of it after first day when the Americans came.</span> <span id="s2000">It was the most exhilarating experience you ever could have had.</span></p> <p><span id="s2001">Q: And you couldn’t even get out of bed?</span></p> <p><span id="s2002">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2003">I remember it so vividly.</span> <span id="s2004">Americans came in [indecipherable] Americans [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2005">There was somebody who spoke Polish, he said, “You fellows just come and walk it off and come on out.</span> <span id="s2006">We have some good food for you.”</span> <span id="s2007">And a few came and a few of us just didn’t and he came to me, he said, “Okay, come on, get off.”</span> <span id="s2008">I said, “I can’t move, I -- I can’t sit even.”</span> <span id="s2009">“Stand [indecipherable] up.”</span> <span id="s2010">Said, “Oh my God, [indecipherable] that bad?”</span> <span id="s2011">I said, “Oh, I’m not so great.</span> <span id="s2012">I’m glad that you people came.</span> <span id="s2013">I don’t feel so great.”</span> <span id="s2014">So he pulled me off and he just [indecipherable] me like a baby.</span> <span id="s2015">“How much do you weigh?”</span> <span id="s2016">“How do I know?”</span> <span id="s2017">“How much you normally weigh?”</span> <span id="s2018">“Oh, about 150.”</span> <span id="s2019">“[indecipherable], you weigh 50 pounds or less.”</span> <span id="s2020">“Oh, no, I was [indecipherable].”</span> <span id="s2021">So he took me directly to the [indecipherable] barrack [indecipherable] hospital and some people came and washed me.</span> <span id="s2022">[indecipherable] me and gave me a [indecipherable] nightshirt.</span> <span id="s2023">And I don’t know, for about two days I was oblivious.</span> <span id="s2024">I don’t know what happened.</span> <span id="s2025">I -- I didn’t [indecipherable] dead, if I was sleeping, if -- if -- if whatever.</span> <span id="s2026">I don’t think I ate for the first two days.</span> <span id="s2027">And they came, three, four, five times a day with that little cup of -- kind of like a thin [indecipherable] soup.</span> <span id="s2028">And we drank and ate it.</span> <span id="s2029">And with all the spam [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2030">Q: Okay, [indecipherable] End of Tape Four, Side B Beginning Tape Five, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s2031">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Stefan Czyzewski.</span> <span id="s2032">Tape number five, side A.</span> <span id="s2033">How did you obtain your U.S. citizenship?</span></p> <p><span id="s2034">A: I applied for it.</span> <span id="s2035">You -- you fill out citi -- certificate of intention or document of intention.</span> <span id="s2036">So I filled it out almost immediately after I came here and three years later, I did get my citizenship.</span> <span id="s2037">The place where I went to improve my English, which was the International Institute, had a special citizenship course, which I took and went through examination.</span> <span id="s2038">And eventually the great day came.</span> <span id="s2039">I was even the person who gave a speech.</span> <span id="s2040">There was a group of about 120 people receiving it and I was asked to -- to give a talk.</span></p> <p><span id="s2041">Q: Be -- You’ve been -- do you hold dual citizenship, are you allowed to?</span> <span id="s2042">Or are you no longer a Polish citizen?</span></p> <p><span id="s2043">A: As far as America -- as far as America is concerned, I have American citizenship and I had to forfeit any other.</span> <span id="s2044">As far as Polish state is concerned, I have a dual citizenship.</span> <span id="s2045">You cannot lose Polish citizenship.</span></p> <p><span id="s2046">Q: And what about your contact over these years, as you got here, with your family?</span> <span id="s2047">Were you writing letters to your family?</span> <span id="s2048">What were they saying about your experiences here?</span></p> <p><span id="s2049">A: Yes, I corresponded with them from shortly before I left Germany, the mail started going through and I was told by one of my sisters, or written by one of my sisters that, “If you can, we would like very much to see you.</span> <span id="s2050">We would like to have you back, very much, but if you can, please don’t come.</span> <span id="s2051">Go elsewhere, because you will end in Piaskovo.”</span> <span id="s2052">That two, three people out of 20 who survived to the end, were sent to Siberia.</span></p> <p><span id="s2053">Q: This is of your group?</span></p> <p><span id="s2054">A: Of my group, of my fighting group, were sent to Siberia and of course, one of them came ba -- came back.</span> <span id="s2055">Those two Jewish boys, Isaac number two and Isaac number one, did not come back.</span> <span id="s2056">So then I stayed in Germany, recuperated, and did not go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s2057">Q: Has there been a point over the years where you have considered returning to Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s2058">A: It never was.</span> <span id="s2059">I have not even gone back for a visit.</span> <span id="s2060">When the Communists ruled, I did not want to go back, because supposedly I was being look -- looked for.</span> <span id="s2061">And my friend and neighbor, who I mentioned previously, whose name was Stefan Voiteewa, became prosecutor general of the Pol-Polish armed forces and he arrested many of the people from my part of Polish underground.</span> <span id="s2062">And rumor had it -- which is supposedly true, that he had [indecipherable] them -- taken out and shot, without trial.</span> <span id="s2063">There was a good encouragement of not going back.</span></p> <p><span id="s2064">Q: Do you know where he is now?</span></p> <p><span id="s2065">A: He kicked the bucket a year ago.</span> <span id="s2066">So if I ever go back to Poland, I’ll go and spit on his grave.</span> <span id="s2067">Even though I kind of forgave him for what he did, but he was an evil person and he was part of it.</span> <span id="s2068">He had the same name as the present Pope and his mother and his family were chauvinistic Catholics.</span> <span id="s2069">When the first of May came, the Socialist holiday, his mother would collect apron full of stones and he will -- she will go, oh like early in the morning, at three a.m. or so, to a house of one Socialist family in the village.</span> <span id="s2070">She would go around and she would break as many windows as she could.</span> <span id="s2071">She was never caught, she was never punished, but everybody knew it was she who did it.</span> <span id="s2072">And he, of course, didn’t want to join the underground.</span> <span id="s2073">He always was on a perryferry.</span> <span id="s2074">As soon as the Soviets came, he joined.</span> <span id="s2075">He fought in with the Polish Communist army, as far as Berlin.</span> <span id="s2076">He was sent to be trained in Moscow and Ouro in Soviet Russia.</span> <span id="s2077">He came back and was still in the Polish army and advanced as far -- in 1975, he became a general and he became a prosecutor in the Polish army, prosecutor.</span></p> <p><span id="s2078">Q: Does your family still own the house in Lesh --</span></p> <p><span id="s2079">A: Leshnagorra?</span></p> <p><span id="s2080">Q: In Leshnagorra.</span></p> <p><span id="s2081">A: No, they don’t.</span> <span id="s2082">My sister Eleanor married a boy in next village, which she moved there and lived with him, his family.</span> <span id="s2083">My sister Henreika lived in our house and had our farm.</span> <span id="s2084">When she was ready to retire, she could either rent out the farm, which was impossible to survive on, or else she had to give it back to the government in lieu of a small pension.</span> <span id="s2085">That’s what she did.</span> <span id="s2086">She sold the house and the lot and the house was on, to a neighbor, for very little money -- neighbor who always helped her.</span> <span id="s2087">And she moved to a nearby town and lived with her son on a -- on a pension.</span> <span id="s2088">She lives there presently.</span> <span id="s2089">So the farm was lost.</span> <span id="s2090">And a farm in Poland before the war, was like a sacrament, you never parted with it.</span> <span id="s2091">That was your inheritance.</span> <span id="s2092">You ne -- you -- piece of land you killed for.</span> <span id="s2093">Presently things apparently changed, so the farm is gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s2094">Q: Do you -- do you have any desire to go back?</span></p> <p><span id="s2095">A: Slight desire.</span> <span id="s2096">I intend to go someth -- somew -- sometime for a visit, but I’m still working full time, even though I am retired.</span> <span id="s2097">I work only 43 hours a week and don’t really want to take a lot of time to go.</span> <span id="s2098">As somebody said, you cannot come home again.</span> <span id="s2099">And it would be kind of difficult to go home again.</span> <span id="s2100">Especially all those people that I knew would be old, decrepit people and I’m the only one young among them.</span> <span id="s2101">And all those pretty girls that I knew are old decrepit women.</span> <span id="s2102">One of them that I ran around with for quite some time, whose name was Helena, when I ask my sister Eleanor how Helena is, she said, “Helena is old and ugly and she weighs 250 pounds.</span> <span id="s2103">One of her legs is bigger than you are.</span> <span id="s2104">You don’t want to see Helena.”</span> <span id="s2105">And Helena was beautiful, plumped, little girl that I had so much fun with.</span> <span id="s2106">So how could I go and see Helena and enjoy seeing her when she is old and ugly and fat?</span> <span id="s2107">She’s dead, by the way, she did not make it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2108">Q: Can you tell us about your job, the job that you eventually got and have had for quite a long time?</span></p> <p><span id="s2109">A: Yes, the job I presently have, I had it for 46 years plus.</span> <span id="s2110">It is a church goods company which has a large bookshop.</span> <span id="s2111">And when I started working there, for about two or three years, I worked in a stockroom, shifting stuff.</span> <span id="s2112">Candles, wine, God knows what else.</span> <span id="s2113">But I always wanted to work in the bookstore.</span> <span id="s2114">Eventually I did and very soon after I started working here, the manager died and his assistant became a manager.</span> <span id="s2115">About two or three years later, the assistant mana -- the manager -- new manager, retired on disability and I became it.</span> <span id="s2116">I been staying -- being it ever since.</span></p> <p><span id="s2117">Q: And the name?</span></p> <p><span id="s2118">A: I love books, I love reading.</span> <span id="s2119">I like the people I work with.</span> <span id="s2120">I really like the people that I serve.</span> <span id="s2121">There’s a lot of r -- book reading people that I serve and I still spend about eight or 10 hours a day reading.</span> <span id="s2122">I take tel -- a lot of telephone calls.</span> <span id="s2123">We have a telephone system that covers the whole country.</span> <span id="s2124">We have 800 number and a lot of calls come specially to me and I fli -- field most of the calls and transfer to somebody else if necessary.</span> <span id="s2125">I buy a lot of books, I sell some books, and I read a lot -- I sit at my desk most of the day and read.</span> <span id="s2126">And if my boss complains, I said, “If I stop reading, I am no good as a bookman any more, so you better let me be.”</span> <span id="s2127">And he said -- he said, “Of course I’ll let you be.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2128">Q: When did you discover this passion for books?</span> <span id="s2129">When did this emerge?</span></p> <p><span id="s2130">A: Just about en -- when I was three.</span> <span id="s2131">My mother was a frustrated schoolteacher, as I previously mentioned.</span> <span id="s2132">She was fired when she had her first baby.</span> <span id="s2133">Back in Poland, if you had a baby, you were married, forget it.</span> <span id="s2134">By time I was three, she taught me how to read and I have never stopped.</span></p> <p><span id="s2135">Q: We had just talked a moment ago about you becoming an American citizen.</span> <span id="s2136">Why did you want to become one?</span></p> <p><span id="s2137">A: The ideas of America -- the idea of American freedom, the idea of opportunity and freedom for all was extremely appealing to me.</span> <span id="s2138">And of course, being a bug for history, I knew that two great Polish people came and fought for America.</span> <span id="s2139">And when I spent time fighting Nazis, I didn’t think that I was fighting for my own country only, but for everybody else who was subjugated by them, including the Americans, who fi -- who was fight -- who were fighting elsewhere.</span> <span id="s2140">So, the idea of America was just a completely ideal place and ideology that appealed greatly to me.</span> <span id="s2141">May we shut it off for awhile?</span></p> <p><span id="s2142">Q: I have to ask you this.</span> <span id="s2143">Tell us about your wife, how you met her, where?</span></p> <p><span id="s2144">A: Well, I had a friend who had a girlfriend and the girlfriend knew Sylvia.</span> <span id="s2145">And we went on a date one time and then we -- Sylvia read books and I read books.</span> <span id="s2146">Sylvia played good music and had a beautiful voice and I always appreciated music and a good voice.</span> <span id="s2147">And eventually she talked me into getting married.</span> <span id="s2148">No, no, I talked her into getting -- into -- into marrying me.</span> <span id="s2149">I wonder what she saw in me, but she got apparently infatuated and then st -- we stuck together forever and ever.</span> <span id="s2150">She is the best girl I ever met.</span> <span id="s2151">Course I wouldn’t dare to say anything else, seeing that she is here, but she really is.</span></p> <p><span id="s2152">Q: When did you get married?</span></p> <p><span id="s2153">A: I’m sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s2154">Q: When did you get married?</span></p> <p><span id="s2155">A: In August, 1940 -- 1954.</span> <span id="s2156">I was going to say ‘44.</span></p> <p><span id="s2157">Q: And tell us about your son.</span></p> <p><span id="s2158">A: While we wanted several children and we were told that you most likely will not have any.</span> <span id="s2159">But eventually we had a son.</span> <span id="s2160">He was the feeblest little thing you ever saw.</span> <span id="s2161">He was premature.</span> <span id="s2162">He was in isolette for several weeks, being rocked back and forth, because -- to breathe, because his lungs were collapsed.</span> <span id="s2163">And now he is big, he is heavy, he is fat and he’s a darn good musician.</span></p> <p><span id="s2164">Q: His name?</span></p> <p><span id="s2165">A: His name is Paul, of course.</span> <span id="s2166">So, his musical name is Paul Raymond, because nobody can pronounce Czyzewski.</span> <span id="s2167">His middle name is Raymond and that was also his grandfather’s name.</span> <span id="s2168">So, when he had a band, first band and a second band and a third band, he always was Paul Raymond.</span></p> <p><span id="s2169">Q: Have you told him about your experiences in the underground and in the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s2170">A: Little.</span> <span id="s2171">Little.</span> <span id="s2172">He -- I don’t know, he may be slightly interested now, but he previously was not interested.</span> <span id="s2173">And I never made an effort to teach him Polish.</span> <span id="s2174">When he was small, he knew few phrases in Polish, but since we speak only English at home, being th -- see, being that Sylvia is Yankee, we didn’t indulge much in Polish and he did not learn it.</span> <span id="s2175">Now, he is somewhat interested.</span> <span id="s2176">It was kind of interesting last year.</span> <span id="s2177">He brought a form from Internal Revenue Service.</span> <span id="s2178">Did any -- did your parents or any of your relatives spend time in a war zone?</span> <span id="s2179">So he was laughing it and I was laughing it and Paul -- they want me to fill it out.</span> <span id="s2180">So he said, “Sure, if you were in war zone, fill it out.”</span> <span id="s2181">And you know, if you were in American army, you were in a war zone for a few d -- five days, a week or two, then you were pulled back and you were put in again.</span> <span id="s2182">So he said, “Well, gee, how long were you in forz -- in war zone?”</span> <span id="s2183">I said, “Two and a half years.”</span> <span id="s2184">“Two and a half years?</span> <span id="s2185">Nobody could make it for two and a half years.”</span> <span id="s2186">I said, “Well, some of us did, some of us didn’t.”</span> <span id="s2187">So I wrote on that form, two and a half years in a war zone.</span> <span id="s2188">And I wrote where, at that territory and then fighting whom and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s2189">And I send it back and never heard from the -- from them again.</span></p> <p><span id="s2190">Q: Did that spark his interest?</span></p> <p><span id="s2191">A: Somewhat, yes.</span> <span id="s2192">Occasionally, now, when I t-talk about it, he -- he listens and when we did get those videos, he said, “Well, gee, someday maybe I wi -- I should watch it, I should listen to it.”</span> <span id="s2193">I said, “Why?</span> <span id="s2194">You get bored to death.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2195">Q: Tell us a little bit about your work with the Mung refugees.</span> <span id="s2196">You, yourself, of course, were a refugee at one point.</span></p> <p><span id="s2197">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2198">Q: A-And -- and you and your wife work with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2199">A: Well, I did very little of that work, because I had a full time job at all times and doing something else.</span> <span id="s2200">But Sylvia was working as an instructor in a program, English for foreign born.</span> <span id="s2201">So she took her -- went to one parish and took individual Mung people and Indochinese people out of the classes and tutor -- tutored them.</span> <span id="s2202">Yeah, Vietnamese refugees.</span> <span id="s2203">And later on, we befriended --</span></p> <p><span id="s2204">Q: It was not Mung, it was Vietnamese?</span></p> <p><span id="s2205">A: Vietnamese first.</span></p> <p><span id="s2206">A2: It was the whole thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2207">Q: Okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2208">A: First.</span> <span id="s2209">And then Sylvia had quite a few Mung people that she tutored -- went to their homes and helped them.</span> <span id="s2210">And from time to time, or quite a few times, we would invite group of Mung people to have picnic with us here.</span> <span id="s2211">And it was kind of interesting.</span> <span id="s2212">We invite 15 Mung people and maybe five or six would show up.</span> <span id="s2213">But also, 47 may show up.</span> <span id="s2214">So one time, we had invited about 15 and I think we had about 40 - some.</span> <span id="s2215">Kids running all over and they were so well behaved.</span> <span id="s2216">I mean, you could -- I mean, neighbors didn’t complain, nobody di -- did anything.</span> <span id="s2217">We had games and we had a lot of food and the kids went in the backyard and watched the ducks and did all kind of things.</span> <span id="s2218">And we still meet some of the -- those Mungs.</span> <span id="s2219">We are out of touch with them presently, but occasionally meet some of them, especially when we go to a vegetable market.</span> <span id="s2220">There was a beautiful, little Mung girl that Sylvia was friends with her mother and her family.</span> <span id="s2221">We see her occasionally selling vegetable and we say hello and chat.</span> <span id="s2222">And then, just about every ti -- well, not every time, but when Sylvia went to tutor them, they would have some little thing -- little Mung thing made and there was an older man, whose name wa -- name was M-Mr.</span> <span id="s2223">Washan.</span> <span id="s2224">He said, “Sylvia, here’s a free gift for you.”</span> <span id="s2225">So, she would get a little trinket or little embroidery square or one time she did get a large embroidery kind of a picture, made by -- as the Mung people make.</span></p> <p><span id="s2226">Q: Did you sponsor a family?</span> <span id="s2227">I don’t know if it was Mung or Vietnamese or Filipino?</span></p> <p><span id="s2228">A: Yes, we -- my -- our parish spons-sponsored two Vietnamese boys about 20 years ago.</span> <span id="s2229">And then when parish tried to divest them -- itself over -- [indecipherable] we took them in and they stayed with us for some time.</span> <span id="s2230">The young -- we found them jobs and the older one became independent quickly and moved out.</span> <span id="s2231">The younger one went to a local Catholic college and graduated.</span> <span id="s2232">And he kind of stayed on and off with us, for about four or five years.</span> <span id="s2233">Eventually, he became independent.</span> <span id="s2234">Three years?</span> <span id="s2235">Okay, three years.</span> <span id="s2236">Became independent, has a new jo -- great job, has a fat American wife and three kids.</span> <span id="s2237">Has a big home and lives next door to us.</span> <span id="s2238">His name is Vonsan and we see him every day, we say hello every day and we visit back and forth frequently.</span> <span id="s2239">And later on, we sponsored two of his brothers, who father sent out, they became boat people.</span> <span id="s2240">Ended somewhere in Indonesia or somewhere and we sponsored those two.</span> <span id="s2241">They came, stayed with us short time, but most of the time did not, because the -- Vonsan became independent, had an apartment.</span> <span id="s2242">So we, of course, we visited a lot back and forth and those two boys are too married -- also married, have children and families and jobs.</span> <span id="s2243">And we sometime visit with them, sometime see them.</span> <span id="s2244">And there was a large group of Vietnamese boys who used to come to Milos or for a visit and they still occasionally come and see us.</span> <span id="s2245">Even bring us little gifts, especially after 15 years, just about every one gave him a clo -- I -- gave us a clock.</span> <span id="s2246">I have several funny looking clocks around.</span> <span id="s2247">Gar-Garish things with butterflies and -- and crazy things in them.</span> <span id="s2248">Holy -- Holy statues in them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2249">Q: Why was that important for you personally to do, the sponsoring of the refugees?</span></p> <p><span id="s2250">A: Well, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2251">Sylvia is very good person and she is very sympathetic to people.</span> <span id="s2252">And seeing that I was a refugee at one time, we kind of did little sponsoring.</span> <span id="s2253">And also, our parish -- our Catholic parish sponsored many, many Laotian, Vietnamese and Mung families.</span> <span id="s2254">And for a long time, we were, and then I was on a committee that worked with them, finding them jobs and places to live and collecting clothing and -- and furniture and things.</span> <span id="s2255">Presently, we are not doing much, or hardly any of it, because I’m old and Sylvia is catching up with me.</span> <span id="s2256">I’m ancient and she -- she is getting old, too.</span> <span id="s2257">She is not nearly as old as I am.</span> <span id="s2258">Many, many years younger.</span></p> <p><span id="s2259">Q: When you speak with Americans about the war, or the concentration camps, or the Holocaust, what do you find?</span> <span id="s2260">I mean, what do you find people know or think about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2261">A: Well, people find it unbelievable.</span> <span id="s2262">People are, at times, shocked.</span> <span id="s2263">But, mostly, people that I talk to about it, is people that I go to give talk about it, like in school or college or -- or group of people that are interested.</span> <span id="s2264">So then, they ask many questions and I answer the questions and sometime elaborate, sometime I hard -- hide a lot of stuff, because they would be too shocking for people.</span> <span id="s2265">And most American people, sus -- especially young people, are completely uninformed and know very little about it.</span> <span id="s2266">Even adults did not know much about it at that time, or did not pay attention toward the end of time, when the news drifted in here about the atrocities, about American army freeing a lot of dead people in a concentratio -- in death camps.</span> <span id="s2267">Many people did not batay -- pay attention to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2268">Q: Does it surprise you that people don’t know the history?</span></p> <p><span id="s2269">A: No, it does not.</span> <span id="s2270">Apparently schools don’t teach mut -- much about it.</span> <span id="s2271">Also, I note it was the last two or three years, all of ca -- all of a sudden, just about every school had a -- a short course on the Holocaust and a short course on the second World War.</span> <span id="s2272">And that’s mostly the pla -- those other places that invite me to come and talk to them about it.</span> <span id="s2273">So that is somewhat gratifying.</span> <span id="s2274">But, for a long time, people were very uninformed about.</span> <span id="s2275">Also, throughout all the time previously, and now, very well educated people, like for instance, college professors, tried to disprove that the Holocaust ever existed.</span> <span id="s2276">There’s a group of professor that’s UCLA, who are very vocal about it, telling everybody who wants to listen and everybody who doesn’t want to listen that Holocaust never existed, that was just a concoction made by certain groups of people, trying to influence us this way or that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s2277">Q: And -- And how does that effect you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2278">A: Well, if I had them nearby, I would feel like bashing their heads in, or telling them off and since I have never met one who would voice that kind of opinion, I do feel upset.</span> <span id="s2279">But we have people who are stupid, we have people who are prejudiced.</span> <span id="s2280">We have pe-people who are hateful and also people who are uninformed or misinformed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2281">Q: I guess this is my last question, which is what do you think you carry with you from the experience, especially of resisting and in the camps?</span> <span id="s2282">Ho-How did it shape you and the rest of your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s2283">A: Well, I’m somewhat satisfied that what I did was not in vain.</span> <span id="s2284">Also, I grieve greatly over those who -- who perished and I’m very grateful for having been able to survive and I frequently pray about it.</span> <span id="s2285">And if it did me -- if it made me a better person or not, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2286">As I previously mentioned, I have never lost my faith and in most circumstances, I am trying to be halfway good Christian.</span> <span id="s2287">And at times I’m not satisfied with it, but I have to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s2288">Q: Is there anything else you’d like to say?</span></p> <p><span id="s2289">A: No, I think we talked blue streak, forever and a day and I really don’t know what else I could add that would except -- I add to it, except that I’m really glad I survived.</span> <span id="s2290">I am so grateful being able to live in a good, free country that with all it’s mishaps as -- and -- and thing that happen that are not great and not savory, still is a great, free country that lives up to it’s ideals.</span></p> <p><span id="s2291">Q: Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s2292">A: You’re very welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s2293">Q: This concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Stefan Czyzewski.</span></p> <p><span
