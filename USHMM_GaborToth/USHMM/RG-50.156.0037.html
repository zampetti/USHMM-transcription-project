didn’t understand too much.</span> <span id="s66">But then we was always attacked, especially a Jewish girl, when we used to go into the parks, they used to throw a stone on us and this-and-that.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: The Christians would do this?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: Christian, yes.</span> <span id="s69">We were afraid to go out late in the night if somebody would attack you.</span> <span id="s70">To rob or just mean things to do to you.</span> <span id="s71">Throw some stones on you or beat you up, or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: Did you have any contacts with gentile people?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: No.</span> <span id="s74">Well, we knew them, because my mother died very young, and I was the oldest of the girls, and we need some help, the house, and we used to have a gentile woman.</span> <span id="s75">She used to come and help me out.</span> <span id="s76">And she was a Polish woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: Getting back to the international scene.</span> <span id="s78">Did you see any newspapers, or hear any radio programs, or hear anything by word of mouth of what was going on in Germany, or that kind of thing, regarding Nazism?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: You know, we couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s80">Because my father used to tell us, during the first war, there was very nice people, the German.</span> <span id="s81">And he couldn’t believe -- he’d say, “Its propaganda, “ my father.</span> <span id="s82">We didn’t pay too much attention to this.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: So your father was living with you, is that correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: Did you have any other relatives who were either living with you or in that community?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s87">We had three brothers and one sister, younger than me.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: How old were you at the outbreak of the war?</span> <span id="s89">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: Well, yes.</span> <span id="s91">Twenty years.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: You were twenty years old.</span> <span id="s93">And how did you receive news of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: We was isolated.</span> <span id="s95">We didn’t know too much about the war.</span> <span id="s96">It was in 1939, was the day after Rosh Hashanah, we noticed planes flying over.</span> <span id="s97">My father said, “It looks like the Russian planes.”</span> <span id="s98">And a few hours later, we noticed Russian soldiers in town, because we were kind of close to the Russian border, that’s why we hadn’t run away.</span> <span id="s99">After two weeks the war, the Germans with the Poles, didn’t last very long.</span> <span id="s100">And then the Russians occupied us.</span> <span id="s101">People were very happy because we heard some rumors that Germany will kill the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s102">And then we were very happy with the Russians.</span> <span id="s103">Well, a lot of people had to close down their stores, because the Russians wouldn’t allow you to have private stores.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: They wouldn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s106">Everything had to be like “kahals,” they called this.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: When the Russians came in, did the people in the Jewish community get together and meet?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A; Well, we used to talk, mostly to find out if any of the Russian soldiers were Jewish soldiers.</span> <span id="s109">We talked to them.</span> <span id="s110">We were not afraid of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: You weren’t afraid of them!</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: No!</span> <span id="s113">Well, my father was afraid.</span> <span id="s114">He said, “ Well, you remember during the war -- the First War -- they attacked the girls, raping, like that.”</span> <span id="s115">But, they were more civilized.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: And what did you talk to the Russian soldiers about?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: How is the life in Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s119">Was there any discussion about getting out of Poland?</span> <span id="s120">Amongst you and your family or in the community?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: Not in this time.</span> <span id="s122">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: When did the Nazis occupy your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: In 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: What actions did the German forces take in the early months or years of occupation that you can recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: The first day, when they came to our town, they took all the men to work, and they never came back.</span> <span id="s127">And my father -- we find out they take them to work, and my father was hidden.</span> <span id="s128">And one German came to the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: Who hid him?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: We did.</span> <span id="s131">We had a bunker ready.</span> <span id="s132">It was in the cellar, in the basement.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: And were your brothers there too?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: No, because one brother was married.</span> <span id="s135">In 1940, my younger brother -- he’s in Israel, now -- they took him to the army, the Soviet army.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: Which army?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: The Russian army.</span> <span id="s138">In 1940.</span> <span id="s139">Because he was supposed to be in the army for three years.</span> <span id="s140">I think, so they took him to the Soviet army.</span> <span id="s141">And in 1941, the day when the war broke out, they took away my older brother to the army.</span> <span id="s142">And, well, he just passed away last year, in Boston.</span> <span id="s143">He was my oldest brother.</span> <span id="s144">And we didn’t heard from them till 1945, that they are alive in Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: To get back to that scene where your father was in the bunker and the German officer came in.</span> <span id="s146">What happened then?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: They just ask for men -- not for women.</span> <span id="s148">And I say, “They took my father away, and I don’t know where.”</span> <span id="s149">He opened two doors of my closet.</span> <span id="s150">And you know, this -- someone’s men’s suits.</span> <span id="s151">He says, “How come?</span> <span id="s152">So many men’s?”</span> <span id="s153">He couldn’t believe it, it’s just my father.</span> <span id="s154">I say, “ Well, it’s my brothers, but I don’t know where they are.”</span> <span id="s155">I didn’t tell him they are in the army, in the Russian army, they took them away.</span> <span id="s156">I didn’t tell.</span> <span id="s157">And he started beating me, and I start screaming and yelling, and my father heard.</span> <span id="s158">And they beat me very bad.</span> <span id="s159">And then one soldier, between them, he was from Holland -- we know that because he had an armband, was written on “Holland” -- and he stopped them.</span> <span id="s160">He said, “ What do you want with a dirty Jew?</span> <span id="s161">Let’s go out.”</span> <span id="s162">And then later he came back, the same soldier.</span> <span id="s163">And he says to me, “ Wear dirty clothes on you.</span> <span id="s164">Put your scarf -- make you kind of older, you know, because they will come again.”</span> <span id="s165">But they never came back.</span> <span id="s166">My father was hidden for two weeks in this bunker.</span> <span id="s167">And then a little bit, it settled down.</span> <span id="s168">They took all the men, what I heard.</span> <span id="s169">The next day we find out that all of them were killed.</span> <span id="s170">All of them.</span> <span id="s171">They took them to work, brought the cars and the soldiers, and this –and-that, and they never came back.</span> <span id="s172">Was about 500,600 Jewish men were killed.</span> <span id="s173">Young and old.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: And your father was hiding for two weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: Yes, and then he came out of his bunker, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: And then what did he do?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: Well, they tried to take us to work.</span> <span id="s178">And my father used to speak -- used to know how -- their language.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: He spoke German?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s181">Jewish and German, it was kind of a resemblance, you know.</span> <span id="s182">And he, somewhere, he went to work every day, and they sent him home, my father, up to 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: What kind of work did he do?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: All kind, and the Gestapo, they asked him to clean, wash and that, because he speaked a little bit German.</span> <span id="s185">In the kitchen.</span> <span id="s186">All kind work.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: And what were you doing at this time then?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: They took me and my sister to work in the field.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: On the farms.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: Kind of farms, yes.</span> <span id="s191">In the morning, and in the evening they brought us back, because we had a Judenrat.</span> <span id="s192">You know what it means a Judenrat?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: Maybe you should explain.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: A Judenrat is what the Germans make like a community.</span> <span id="s195">Because what they wanted, the Germans, they wanted not to the private Jewish people, they came to the Judenrat, and the Judenrat, they ask, “How much?”</span> <span id="s196">You have to give me this day so many people to work.”</span> <span id="s197">“We need at this time so many furs.”</span> <span id="s198">And they collect from us.</span> <span id="s199">Furs, silver, gold, all kind, or sheets, because they need it on the front -- the German.</span> <span id="s200">Especially white sheets.</span> <span id="s201">When it was snow, they needed to cover up on top.</span> <span id="s202">And the Judenrat used to come -- ask the private people for this.</span> <span id="s203">That’s what they do.</span> <span id="s204">So hard to explain, you know.</span> <span id="s205">And it’s so hard to understand this, too, for people that they didn’t go through.</span> <span id="s206">“What you mean, fur?”</span> <span id="s207">You know?</span> <span id="s208">It’s impossible.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: Well, we’ll make an attempt here.</span> <span id="s210">How long were you in your town then?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: I was from 1941 to 1943.</span> <span id="s212">But during the time, they made a ghetto.</span> <span id="s213">In 1942, they made a ghetto in our city which, in the war, was a very small area, and was living in the one room, we had about three, four families -- one on the top.</span> <span id="s214">I lived with my sister -- younger sister, but she’s killed -- and my father’s sister with the kids.</span> <span id="s215">We were maybe about fifteen, sixteen people in such a small room.</span> <span id="s216">And then everybody got sick -- typhus.</span> <span id="s217">Hunger.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: Were there any medical supplies available?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: Oh, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: What about food?</span> <span id="s221">How much food was there available?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: Very little.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: How much?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: Well, we were a little bit lucky with food, because like my father used to work for the Germans, you know, and they used to take him to work.</span> <span id="s225">And they used to give him, some of them, and he brought us home, little by little.</span> <span id="s226">My father had a lot of friends, with gentiles.</span> <span id="s227">And he used to sell them.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: He did!</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s230">We supposed to go in the ghetto, we left our big house with all furnitures, because we were pretty well off.</span> <span id="s231">And a gentile family took over our house there.</span> <span id="s232">He was a shoemaker, the gentile.</span> <span id="s233">And we went to live in his place, because this was the area for the ghetto.</span> <span id="s234">It was a very small house.</span> <span id="s235">And we tried to sell a lot of things out -- furniture --for nothing, very cheap.</span> <span id="s236">For potatoes -- 10 pounds potatoes.</span> <span id="s237">Could give away a bedroom set for a little potatoes, a little flour, a little chicken.</span> <span id="s238">This is the way we lived!</span> <span id="s239">We sold everything that was ours to them.</span> <span id="s240">For nothing!</span> <span id="s241">Just a little bit food.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: Who did you sell it to?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: To the gentiles.</span> <span id="s244">Clothes, everything, we sell them, to let us survive!</span> <span id="s245">To have a little bit food.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: How long were you in the ghetto then?</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: From 1942 to 1943.</span> <span id="s248">In between the time, was a lot of killing!</span> <span id="s249">Oh!</span> <span id="s250">Yes!</span> <span id="s251">It was early in the morning…</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: You saw?</span> <span id="s253">You saw it going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: Some.</span> <span id="s255">But not much, because, like I say, one morning, it was in 1943, I think, or end of 1942, I think, right when they made it a ghetto.</span> <span id="s256">All the Jews, they wanted to have all the Jews in the one side.</span> <span id="s257">And one morning, we noticed all the ghetto was surrounded with SS -- Gestapo -- “Raus, raus, raus, all people.”</span> <span id="s258">And my father heard this, and he started running back to the house.</span> <span id="s259">He said, “ We have to be hidden somewhere, have to hide someplace.”</span> <span id="s260">We had an attic, you know, on top of the house.</span> <span id="s261">And he was hidden between, you know, was a lot of junk, because so many families it was, and we have to keep everything on top.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: You were in the attic, like, of the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s264">And we were lying behind, covered up a lot, with junk.</span> <span id="s265">There was a lot of old furnitures, this kind of thing.</span> <span id="s266">Broken things.</span> <span id="s267">They came, and looked for us, and they couldn’t find us.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: And then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: After a few days, it kind of quieted down, because we heard people start talking.</span> <span id="s270">You know, we heard voices.</span> <span id="s271">And they said, “Oh, they took this family away, they took this family in…” and they say, “I believe that they took them to the depot and they were transferred away.”</span> <span id="s272">But we didn’t know where.</span> <span id="s273">They was packed in the trains, but we didn’t know where.</span> <span id="s274">We didn’t know about Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s275">We couldn’t figure out what happened.</span> <span id="s276">And then again and again.</span> <span id="s277">When I heard what they did, they asked us to dig your own grave.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: They asked you.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: No.</span> <span id="s280">People.</span> <span id="s281">I mean I never saw this.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: People in the Jewish community.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: Yeah, I was the one lucky.</span> <span id="s284">I always was having, you know, miracles.</span> <span id="s285">They never could see me, find me.</span> <span id="s286">I always was hidden someplace when they made it this kind of -- they used to call this: oblava.</span> <span id="s287">This is a Polish name.</span> <span id="s288">This mean…</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: This means to search?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s291">And I was always the one.</span> <span id="s292">They never got me.</span> <span id="s293">Really.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: So you were in the attic then for how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: For three, four days.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: And then where did you go from there?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: Well, like they took the people away to -- it must have been to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: Yes, but how about you?</span> <span id="s299">Where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: We came down, and that was kind of again, back to work in the fields, again the same thing.</span> <span id="s301">Yeah, again, for a couple of weeks, a couple months.</span> <span id="s302">And then where we work again.</span> <span id="s303">And they always make the ghetto smaller and smaller, because we had not too many Jewish people, and they had to make the place smaller.</span> <span id="s304">What happened one day, what I did was, a neighbor, he was a tailor, and he used to do a lot of work for the Germans, and they let him stay -- not in ghetto -- on the other side, because he worked for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: For the what side?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: For them.</span> <span id="s307">He was not on the ghetto side, on the opposite.</span> <span id="s308">Different, you know, in the city.</span> <span id="s309">He worked for them.</span> <span id="s310">And he said one time, “ Listen, I have a daughter.</span> <span id="s311">And she’s in ghetto.</span> <span id="s312">Maybe she will help me to do, to tailor, in my shop.”</span> <span id="s313">And they believed him, I’m his daughter, and they gave me a card, I can go forth and back.</span> <span id="s314">Out from ghetto, into the ghetto, you know.</span> <span id="s315">And during the day I used to work, help him out.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: So you were working in the tailor shop.</span> <span id="s317">And how long did you work in that?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: About three or four months, I think so.</span> <span id="s319">And I always used to see how they used to do across from the ghetto what they used to do.</span> <span id="s320">Kill the people, beat ‘em, drag ‘em.</span> <span id="s321">I saw everything.</span> <span id="s322">And then, they didn’t put me anymore to the field.</span> <span id="s323">And then one day, the tailor went to see a Gestapo, to try on a suit, to finish up a suit, because his attitude was tailoring, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: This is Gestapo officer.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s326">And then I looked out through the window and I saw everything’s like in a fire -- the ghetto.</span> <span id="s327">I could see across.</span> <span id="s328">A lot of SS and a lot of Gestapos with rifles.</span> <span id="s329">And this was the end.</span> <span id="s330">They cleaned up all the Jews in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s331">So then I run out through the back door ,and I start run and run and run -- so far.</span> <span id="s332">And I heard shooting.</span> <span id="s333">So terrible.</span> <span id="s334">And I notice, a little boy with his grandma.</span> <span id="s335">And she couldn’t hear it.</span> <span id="s336">She was very bad hearing, and she didn’t see me.</span> <span id="s337">And the little boy noticed I was spent and she had cows and horses.</span> <span id="s338">In a stable.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: She was a gentile woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s341">And I run, and I open the door from the stable and I climbed in the hay and I was hidden in this hay.</span> <span id="s342">And she didn’t see me.</span> <span id="s343">And the little boy saw me, but he couldn’t say, “ Grandma, a lady, a lady!”</span> <span id="s344">But she didn’t see me.</span> <span id="s345">She was kind of deaf, you know.</span> <span id="s346">I was staying for all day and all night, and the second day I was afraid to get out, and finally got the second day dark, I figure, “Well, I have to get out.”</span> <span id="s347">I didn’t eat anything.</span> <span id="s348">It was in the night, and I knew my father was in the labor camp, already.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: What year was this now?</span> <span id="s350">About what month?</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: In 1943.</span> <span id="s352">August, I would say, or July, something like that.</span> <span id="s353">I can’t remember exactly.</span> <span id="s354">And I figured, “Well, I will try to go to my father.”</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: He was in a labor camp.</span> <span id="s356">Do you know which one?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: In the same city, Skalat.</span> <span id="s358">And I went to the labor camp.</span> <span id="s359">And it was wires around.</span> <span id="s360">I crawled under the wires and I came to my father’s cabin.</span> <span id="s361">There where he was, he was working in the labor camp, too, and he was surprised to see me.</span> <span id="s362">And I say, “I survived.”</span> <span id="s363">I told him how.</span> <span id="s364">And he asked me how about my sister?</span> <span id="s365">I say, “I don’t know anything about her.”</span> <span id="s366">Which I never saw her anymore.</span> <span id="s367">And I couldn’t stay in this labor camp long.</span> <span id="s368">I was hidden in the labor camp, too, because they took all the furnitures out from the ghetto, and brought everything into the labor camp.</span> <span id="s369">All what the people owned, little furniture stuff.</span> <span id="s370">And I was hidden in a yard, in the furniture.</span> <span id="s371">And my father used to bring me, for a couple of days, some food, to eat something.</span> <span id="s372">And then all of a sudden my father heard rumors, they will come and search for people, because they knew.</span> <span id="s373">And then he brought me to his place, and he hid me under the bunker, too.</span> <span id="s374">In the labor camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: Was he living in like a barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: Barracks.</span> <span id="s377">Kind of like that.</span> <span id="s378">And one day, he says to me, I can’t sit anymore longer in there because they would search again this place, because they knew.</span> <span id="s379">And he said he could go out from this labor camp.</span> <span id="s380">He took me to a gentile woman.</span> <span id="s381">And the gentile woman had a bunker in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s382">And I was hidden by her for two weeks.</span> <span id="s383">Then she came to me to say, she’s afraid to keep me any lot longer.</span> <span id="s384">And then I find out they killed my father.</span> <span id="s385">She told me, “ Your father’s not living anymore.</span> <span id="s386">They killed a lot of people out in the labor camp.</span> <span id="s387">They took them out to the fields and they shot all, a lot of people.”</span> <span id="s388">And she say, “ Now I just can’t keep you anymore longer in mine house.”</span> <span id="s389">I went back to labor camp and they gave me a card.</span> <span id="s390">I’m legal to work in this labor camp.</span> <span id="s391">I was there for two, three months, I can’t remember exactly.</span> <span id="s392">And then one day came an SS man in the night and say.</span> <span id="s393">“Listen, tomorrow will come the Gestapo from a different city and they’re going to finish all.</span> <span id="s394">They’re going to kill all the camp.</span> <span id="s395">All the people.”</span> <span id="s396">And there wouldn’t be anymore.</span> <span id="s397">It will be Judenfrei completely.</span> <span id="s398">The city will be completely frei -- free -- from the Jews.”</span> <span id="s399">I went back to the gentile woman.</span> <span id="s400">She wouldn’t let me in anymore.</span> <span id="s401">No.</span> <span id="s402">And she said to me, ‘ Do what you want, but not in mine house.’</span> <span id="s403">And she had around her house a big garden.</span> <span id="s404">It was growing corn.</span> <span id="s405">I didn’t know where to go.</span> <span id="s406">I went in bushes around the house.</span> <span id="s407">I said, “ Where am I gonna go?”</span> <span id="s408">I went, I was lying in the bushes.</span> <span id="s409">In the morning we heard --because the gentile woman didn’t live too far from the labor camp -- and this was the truth.</span> <span id="s410">They came, the Gestapo, and they took away all the people from the labor camp.</span> <span id="s411">And later on they searched the area around the labor camp, and were searching this place where I was with the gentile woman.</span> <span id="s412">I saw them -- the Gestapo -- and they didn’t see me.</span> <span id="s413">They didn’t see me.</span> <span id="s414">When it got dark, I came out from the bushes, you know, and I say, ‘ Give me a little water,” to the gentile woman.</span> <span id="s415">And she said, “ I will give you water and a piece of bread, but would you please leave mine house.</span> <span id="s416">I’m afraid.”</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: So the gentile woman didn’t wanna hide you.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: No.</span> <span id="s419">and then we heard, there’s a lot of people, there in the woods.</span> <span id="s420">But how to get to the woods?</span> <span id="s421">You have to go just in the night.</span> <span id="s422">Not in the daytime.</span> <span id="s423">She wouldn’t let me in anymore, so I started walking.</span> <span id="s424">And then I heard somebody behind me and it was a Jewish man and a Jewish woman say, ‘ You survived?</span> <span id="s425">How did you survive from the camp?”</span> <span id="s426">I say, “ When I heard the rumors then I took off, too.</span> <span id="s427">The same way.’</span> <span id="s428">And then we were already three of us.</span> <span id="s429">And what next we gonna do.</span> <span id="s430">We just can’t go back to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s431">The ghetto’s not anymore people in there.</span> <span id="s432">We just can’t go back to the labor camp.</span> <span id="s433">She said, ‘ Let’s go to the woods.”</span> <span id="s434">I said, “ I don’t know the way to go.</span> <span id="s435">How?”</span> <span id="s436">She said, “ During the day, we will go and we will lay in the fields.</span> <span id="s437">In the night we will start walking.”</span> <span id="s438">And this is the way we did it.</span> <span id="s439">We walked for a whole week that way, you know, until we came to the woods.</span> <span id="s440">We start searching for people in the woods.</span> <span id="s441">We didn’t see nobody else, you know?</span> <span id="s442">And we wandered, we walked and walked, and in the meantime we heard voices.</span> <span id="s443">And I say, “ Oh, I think I hear somebody talking.”</span> <span id="s444">And then the people heard us talking.</span> <span id="s445">They were afraid this is Germans, you know.</span> <span id="s446">And then one woman, I heard – “Oye, I think that this is Hinda.</span> <span id="s447">It’s my neighbor.”</span> <span id="s448">And then I heard a voice, “Come out, we are here.</span> <span id="s449">We’re here, we are in the bushes.</span> <span id="s450">We have to be hidden.”</span> <span id="s451">I stayed for nine months in the woods.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: How’d you survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: We had a bunker.</span> <span id="s454">They made a bunker.</span> <span id="s455">During the night we went to the villages -- steal.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q Food.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: Food.</span> <span id="s458">It’s hard to say this.</span> <span id="s459">(Laughter)</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: Well, that’s okay.</span> <span id="s461">That’s fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: We steal.</span> <span id="s463">We went to the fields and we digged potatoes.</span> <span id="s464">Every night we went to the field, dig out the potatoes.</span> <span id="s465">All kind, corn.</span> <span id="s466">We ate this, you know.</span> <span id="s467">Beets.</span> <span id="s468">And we made “graves,” and we put it up, because we know we will stay for a whole winter.</span> <span id="s469">We covered up with dirt, with grass, and every day we took it out, and we made it in the night, a fire.</span> <span id="s470">We baked potatoes to have for all day, because we couldn’t make a fire during the daytime.</span> <span id="s471">Just in the night.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: How many were there of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: I would say, was a few groups.</span> <span id="s474">One group was five and one group was three and one group was seven, you know, and we were groups.</span> <span id="s475">We helped each other.</span> <span id="s476">In the winter time we melted snow, we had some water to drink.</span> <span id="s477">And we made a fire to keep us warm, too.</span> <span id="s478">Because we didn’t have no shoes-- just rags, because we used to steal some rags in the villages from the gentiles.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: Were you involved in any partisan groups?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: Partisan?</span> <span id="s481">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: So how long were you in the woods then”</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: We were in the woods till 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: And what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A; ‘Till March, 1944 --March the 14th.</span> <span id="s486">The Russians liberate us.</span> <span id="s487">That’s why we had it a little bit easier, like I said.</span> <span id="s488">We were close to the Russian border, that’s why we had the Russians early.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q; Did they just come up one morning or evening?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: No, the fight was twelve days.</span> <span id="s491">The fighting in this town.</span> <span id="s492">We could hear the Russian, we could hear the Germans -- we were surrounded, you know -- talking.</span> <span id="s493">And then, was one Russian, a soldier, he was wounded.</span> <span id="s494">And he crawled.</span> <span id="s495">We had a bunker, room for people about six or seven, and we were afraid a tank will come, will run, pass through, and we were afraid, because it could have crushed us.</span> <span id="s496">And every few hours somebody came out from the bunker and was watching.</span> <span id="s497">And in the meantime, this Russian soldier was wounded.</span> <span id="s498">We took him into the bunker and he told us, “ It’s kind of close.</span> <span id="s499">Maybe in a few days we’ll take over the city.”</span> <span id="s500">And one day we heard a lot of Russians speaking, and we took out the soldier, wounded, and we brought him to the staff.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: The staff?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: It happened it was a major -- a Jewish major.</span> <span id="s503">And he was kind of surprised to see people.</span> <span id="s504">We were hungry, cold, and he gave us something to eat.</span> <span id="s505">And he says, “ You have to stay still another day in the woods, because it wouldn’t be safe to go out to the city.</span> <span id="s506">You never know what can happen,” he say.</span> <span id="s507">“And better stay another day, then you will be safe to go on the city.”</span> <span id="s508">And we listened.</span> <span id="s509">We listened to him, and they went their way, you know.</span> <span id="s510">They didn’t stay in one place.</span> <span id="s511">Then finally we started going to the city.</span> <span id="s512">Boy, when people, the gentiles, saw us walking, they were surprised.</span> <span id="s513">“Still Jewish people living!</span> <span id="s514">Jewish people living!’</span> <span id="s515">And everything was bombed!</span> <span id="s516">You should have seen, here Russian dead soldiers and German soldiers lay in the streets.</span> <span id="s517">You could see horses.</span> <span id="s518">Everything!</span> <span id="s519">Houses burn.</span> <span id="s520">It was a fight twelve days in such a small city.</span> <span id="s521">And then I notice mine house is still there.</span> <span id="s522">Everyone said, “ Let’s go.”</span> <span id="s523">I say, “How?</span> <span id="s524">I’m sure the gentile people live there.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: Who were you with at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: In a group, people, you know.</span> <span id="s527">Few people.</span> <span id="s528">And she saw me, and she said, “ You still alive?”</span> <span id="s529">She says, “ I’ll let you sleep, but you have to sleep on the floor.”</span> <span id="s530">She wouldn’t give me back anything.</span> <span id="s531">I didn’t have no choice.</span> <span id="s532">I went to sleep.</span> <span id="s533">Next day in the morning I say, I don’t wanna stay any more with her.</span> <span id="s534">She treat me very bad.</span> <span id="s535">And I came out and I cried.</span> <span id="s536">And then another one, was a captain, from the Russian, and he say, “Why you cry?”</span> <span id="s537">And I say.</span> <span id="s538">And he say, “You Jewish?</span> <span id="s539">You are yeraika” -- it’s Russian Jewish -- and I say, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s540">And I had my palm with blisters in my hand, and he was a doctor, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: Blisters from what?</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: Blisters from boils.</span> <span id="s543">All mine hand, all over my body.</span> <span id="s544">And he took out a little tiny scissors and opened all the blisters and put some cream, I don’t know what kind, and then put bandages all mine hand.</span> <span id="s545">He gave me something to eat.</span> <span id="s546">And he say, “What do you want?”</span> <span id="s547">He say, ‘ I will kick her out.”</span> <span id="s548">I say, “ No, I don’t want.”</span> <span id="s549">I didn’t wanna stay in this house, because it’s too many bad memories.</span> <span id="s550">I don’t want to tell him I’m afraid.</span> <span id="s551">“What I wanted is to take out, a few pillows mine and a blanket and I will go my way.’</span> <span id="s552">He went to the house and took away a pillow and a few blankets.</span> <span id="s553">And then, we all got together, all the Jews, maybe a hundred, and we all lived in not such a big house.</span> <span id="s554">The window was broken from the war.</span> <span id="s555">We were staying, and a little by little, “I was sick in the hospital,” it’s a lot to tell.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: Yes, I know.</span> <span id="s557">We’re at the point now where you had gotten a few belongings from your home.</span> <span id="s558">You decided not to stay there, and then you had left there.</span> <span id="s559">Where’d you go from there then?</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: Like I say, we got together, all the survivors, and we lived in one big room.</span> <span id="s561">Must be 80, 90, 100, I can’t remember exactly.</span> <span id="s562">And then we stayed for a few weeks and everybody got, you know, different places to go.</span> <span id="s563">We begged a lot of food from people, especially from the gentiles, because they tried to be nice to make up to the Jewish people what they had done bad.</span> <span id="s564">And I went to a woman, to a gentile, to stay because I was sick.</span> <span id="s565">To a gentile woman, because she used to know my parents very well.</span> <span id="s566">She used to work sometimes.</span> <span id="s567">And she shared a little bit food with me.</span> <span id="s568">I stayed until I took back mine house.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: Oh, you did.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: I did.</span> <span id="s571">I took mine house back because maybe for two months, I would say, or maybe three months, because she wouldn’t give me back this house, I went to the police and told them what happened, why she lives in this house, because we were forced out because they made the ghetto.</span> <span id="s572">And we trade, because she gave us a very old house -- house, ha!</span> <span id="s573">She called it a house, you know.</span> <span id="s574">Well, she didn’t want to go back to her old place.</span> <span id="s575">And they made her go -- to fix back this place, and they gave her about two, three weeks to fix up her place, and she was supposed to give me back mine house.</span> <span id="s576">She did.</span> <span id="s577">She didn’t have no choice.</span> <span id="s578">She was ordered from the court to do that.</span> <span id="s579">And when I took back mine house, then I took a family to stay with me, to live with me, you know.</span> <span id="s580">A survivor, too, with her mother and her daughter, four people, with a cousin.</span> <span id="s581">She stayed for a little while.</span> <span id="s582">She paid a little bit money, rent, which helped me a little bit.</span> <span id="s583">And then I find me a job working in a restaurant.</span> <span id="s584">And then I got sick again.</span> <span id="s585">I couldn’t work anymore.</span> <span id="s586">In the meantime, my brother wrote a letter from Siberia.</span> <span id="s587">And it was kind of a surprise for me to hear from him.</span> <span id="s588">And he asked who survived, who lives.</span> <span id="s589">And I wrote him back.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: Let me get back to your brother.</span> <span id="s591">How did he get to Siberia?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: In 1941, the Russians took him to the army, you know.</span> <span id="s593">I told you in the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s595">I just wanted a recap on that.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: And we each had very little, but he heard I’m sick, and I just can’t work.</span> <span id="s597">He heard that from a friend, too, and he sent me a little bit money, for a little while.</span> <span id="s598">That way I survived a little bit.</span> <span id="s599">I was awful sick.</span> <span id="s600">I couldn’t walk.</span> <span id="s601">And I didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s602">Then I wrote him back, I said, “ A lot of Jewish people that survived, they are survivors, but they don’t want to stay in the same city.</span> <span id="s603">They wanna leave.”</span> <span id="s604">Then he told me I should do the same thing what everybody does.</span> <span id="s605">Go out and move and leave this place, because it was horrible to live in this place, just a lot of bad memories, you know.</span> <span id="s606">And he said, “ If they will let us free from Siberia, we will come, too, where you will be.”</span> <span id="s607">I went to Germany, to Gliwice.</span> <span id="s608">That’s a German city that was occupied from the Russian.</span> <span id="s609">The Polish, they divided it again, they made it a Polish state again.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: You met your husband in…</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: In Gliwice, 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: How’d you arrange to come to the United States then?</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: Well we lived in Gliwice for a while and then we moved to Valdenburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: Also in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: Germany.</span> <span id="s616">It’s Polish over there now.</span> <span id="s617">And we started writing letters to New York.</span> <span id="s618">He knew he had some family there.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: Your husband did.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s621">And then we couldn’t, you know.</span> <span id="s622">They just started writing and they sent a little bit us money.</span> <span id="s623">But then we find out the Haganah is working.</span> <span id="s624">This was in 1946.</span> <span id="s625">The Haganah -- the Israeli organization -- they had an office in Czechoslovakia and they tried to let people out from Poland to come to Czechoslovakia, and from Czechoslovakia to Austria, and from Austria to Germany to the American zone.</span> <span id="s626">They helped us, the Haganah.</span> <span id="s627">We crossed the borders.</span> <span id="s628">( At this point, Helen’s husband, Allen Mastbaum, joins the interview.)</span> <span id="s629">Allen: They paid the money from the people that was by the boundary.</span> <span id="s630">The Polish took the money and they let us go.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s632">They let us go through.</span> <span id="s633">We crossed the border from Poland to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s634">They paid the money, the Haganah.</span> <span id="s635">They helped us.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">A.M: ‘Cause they took us to Austria, from Austria to Ulm, Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: We were in a D.P. camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A.M: This was UNRRA.</span> <span id="s639">That was the organization in America.</span> <span id="s640">They kept us over there, and give to eat, six years.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: Well, then we start working a little bit, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">A.M: Start working in a camp.</span> <span id="s643">We work in camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: From 1946 to 1951.</span> <span id="s645">In 1949 we left Ulm and we went to Hamburg, to the D.P. camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A.M: By Munich.</span> <span id="s647">And then I find an uncle.</span> <span id="s648">My father’s two brothers was here in St. Paul.</span> <span id="s649">And I wrote a letter to the organization in New York.</span> <span id="s650">I didn’t know where they lived.</span> <span id="s651">I just know the name, so I wrote it to New York to the organization and it took six, seven weeks, and I received from New York, they sent me the address.</span> <span id="s652">They sent me the name and everything from St. Paul.</span> <span id="s653">And I wrote and they answered me.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: They sent us letters and papers to come here.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A.M: Yeah, then they send me the papers.</span> <span id="s656">Then I come here.</span> <span id="s657">I got here three cousins, maybe you know them?</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: Yeah, I might.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A.M: Leonard Mastbaum -- he’s a doctor in Minneapolis -- and Joe Mast, a lawyer, and Sam Mastbaum.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: We came here.</span> <span id="s661">We worked both very hard, very hard to raise our family.</span> <span id="s662">Worked hard until now.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A.M: After two weeks I went to Whirlpool Corporation to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s665">We’ll get to your story in the next tape.</span> <span id="s666">I appreciate your input into this, to clarify what happened after the Russian occupation.</span> <span id="s667">That will be some ground that we probably won’t need to cover in your tape.</span> <span id="s668">But I want to sum up here.</span> <span id="s669">We’re kind of getting to the end of Mrs. Mastbaum’s interview, and I wanted to know whether you maintain contact with other survivors -- or do you belong to any survivor organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: I belong.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: You are going to an event in Washington D.C. starting--what date?</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: The 10th of April.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: 1983.</span> <span id="s674">Which will be a gathering of, I understand, something like 15,000 survivors of the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: Well, I heard, eleven, now it’s fifteen.</span> <span id="s676">Yes, from Canada, too.</span> <span id="s677">Don’t forget it will be the second generation, the third generation, because my son goes, my daughter goes, and my grandson goes.</span> <span id="s678">He’s the third generation, already.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: So, we’ve discussed some of your experiences here, and maybe you can tell me in your own words what it means to be a survivor of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s680">What it means to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: Well, I should say -- painful.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: Do you think that being a survivor has changed your feelings about human nature?</span> <span id="s683">Non-Jewish people?</span> <span id="s684">Jewish people?</span> <span id="s685">Polish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: Polish people was very mean to us.</span> <span id="s687">Very mean.</span> <span id="s688">If they saw a Jew, you know, they could chop off his head and buy a pound of sugar, take somebody’s life away.</span> <span id="s689">It’s a terrible thing.</span> <span id="s690">How people can do it?</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q: Do you believe that your practice in Judaism has been changed because of these experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: Changed a lot.</span> <span id="s693">Especially religious.</span> <span id="s694">I’m not changed.</span> <span id="s695">I’m a Jew through and through, but changed in different ways.</span> <span id="s696">I don’t believe in a lot of things now.</span> <span id="s697">The one thing what I believe, I told my kids, I don’t like a mixed marriage.</span> <span id="s698">I don’t.</span> <span id="s699">I just don’t like it.</span> <span id="s700">It’s not I’m prejudiced.</span> <span id="s701">It’s left in mine feeling, I just don’t believe in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: I can understand.</span> <span id="s703">Have you seen any films or read any books about the Holocaust?</span> <span id="s704">Do you think they tell the story right?</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: Well, it did tell the story right, but it’s not even half what they show.</span> <span id="s706">They just bat the ball.</span> <span id="s707">Did you see the movie, The Wall?</span> <span id="s708">It was last year, I would say.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: What did you think of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: It’s the truth.</span> <span id="s711">But not the half.</span> <span id="s712">What you see and what you read, it’s not compared to going through this.</span> <span id="s713">It’s completely different.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: Do you have any photos or mementoes or other things from those years that you’d be willing to share with the JCRC-ADL?</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: I didn’t have the photos.</span> <span id="s716">I have bad memories.</span> <span id="s717">Very bad dreams.</span> <span id="s718">Nothing else.</span> <span id="s719">Just bad dreams left to me.</span> <span id="s720">Constantly.</span> <span id="s721">It’s already how many years?</span> <span id="s722">Forty-three years?</span> <span id="s723">They still are.</span> <span id="s724">One day, when I hear him screaming and yelling, I was scared, and I woke him up.</span> <span id="s725">I say, “What happened?”</span> <span id="s726">He said, “They pulled me by my hair.</span> <span id="s727">They wanna kill me.”</span> <span id="s728">They still are, still left in us.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: Is there anything else that we should say before we conclude this interview?</span> <span id="s730">Things you’d like to add or anything like that?</span> <span id="s731">If my memory serves me correctly -- the Germans -- did they ever compensate, or provide anything to the victims or the survivors of the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: Nothing for me, no.</span> <span id="s733">I’m still sick.</span> <span id="s734">I don’t have anything from them, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: You still suffer physically.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: Well, physical, emotional, sure.</span> <span id="s737">Life goes on.</span> <span id="s738">You have to go on, you know, there’s nothing you can do.</span> <span id="s739">I write my family, and I only get letters now, to see my family.</span> <span id="s740">And I hope they don’t have to go through what I went through in my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: Your family’s living in the Twin Cities area?</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: My daughter lives in Madison, Wisconsin, and she works.</span> <span id="s743">She has an education.</span> <span id="s744">And my sin-in-law, they’re both working.</span> <span id="s745">She’s a library scientist.</span> <span id="s746">And my son-in-law is a child psychologist.</span> <span id="s747">And a son, Norman, he’s a psychologist, working here, and he has a son.</span> <span id="s748">And I have a third son Ozzie Mastbaum, he is disabled.</span> <span id="s749">And I believe that he’s disabled, maybe, because of what I went through in my life.</span> <span id="s750">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s751">Maybe it’s possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: I want to thank you very much.</span> <span id="s753">I know this has been difficult for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s755">It’s very difficult.</span> <span id="s756">It’s very painful.</span> <span id="s757">I don’t think I can tell everything I went through.</span> <span id="s758">There’s still a lot to add, still a lot to say.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">Q: There’s a lot you can’t say.</span> <span id="s760">Yeah, I understand.</span> <span id="s761">I should explain on this tape that I’m at your home with you and your husband, Allen Mastbaum, who was helping us with this history regarding what happened after the Soviet occupation of Poland, and we’re going to talk to Mr. Mastbaum on another tape, and he’s going to tell us his story.</span> <span id="s762">So at this point I’d like to complete the interview with Helen Mastbaum by David Zarkin, myself, on April 3, 1983, at the Mastbaum home in St. Paul.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">PAGE</span></p> <p><span
