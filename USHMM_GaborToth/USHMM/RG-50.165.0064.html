1990</span></p> <p><span id="s12">WH: What is your first name?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">CL: “Chris” is my adopted name.</span> <span id="s14">Rosalie is my real first name but Chris is the name I adopted when we escaped during the war.</span> <span id="s15">Rosalie was a typical Jewish girl’s name in Poland.</span> <span id="s16">My sisters also picked Christian names.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">WH: Why did you keep it here?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">CL: My sisters had trained themselves to know me also as Chris, so they got used to it and the name stuck.</span> <span id="s19">My official name is still Rosalie and the middle initial is C.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">WH: Does it ever happen that people mistake you for being Christian?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">CL: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">WH: How long did you stay in New York when you came from Bremenhaven?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">CL: About a year, in Crown Heights.</span> <span id="s24">We came as DPs through HIAS.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">WH: How did you decide to come to the farm?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">CL: It was interesting.</span> <span id="s27">We are basically city people and we didn’t look for farming.</span> <span id="s28">Our families were never farmers.</span> <span id="s29">They had flour mills that processed grain and the only connection then was that we were processing something that was grown on the farm.</span> <span id="s30">We first came here when we visited friends of ours from Europe who had settled on the farm five or six months earlier, and we thought it was beautiful, with the flowers.</span> <span id="s31">New York City…I don’t have to tell you what New York looked like.</span> <span id="s32">My husband was working as a clerk in a grocery store.</span> <span id="s33">But he was a very capable person; he could always manage things.</span> <span id="s34">One day he came home and said, “I’m not going to stay in this job.”</span> <span id="s35">And I said, “Why?”</span> <span id="s36">, and he said, “I got such a good offer from the boss that if I accept it, I’ll remain there the rest of my life and I’m not made to work for someone else.</span> <span id="s37">I’m made to work for myself.”</span> <span id="s38">And that was it.</span> <span id="s39">He’s a very independent individual and he knows what he wants out of life.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">WH: Who helped you buy the farm?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">CL: My uncle and the JAS.</span> <span id="s42">We also took out a mortgage.</span> <span id="s43">I wasn’t even there.</span> <span id="s44">My husband called me to tell me he had bought the farm and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">WH: This place might as well be a thousand miles from New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">CL: Well, much as I love the city, I also love the farm.</span> <span id="s47">It was like my town.</span> <span id="s48">And here we are close to Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s49">Many times we used to finish up on the farm at 5:00 p.m., get a babysitter, go to New York, go to the theater at 8:00 p.m., get out, get back into the car, drive as far as Bordentown down 206.</span> <span id="s50">They used to have a diner.</span> <span id="s51">We used to stop and have breakfast at 2:00 a.m.</span> <span id="s52">We came home, changed into our working clothes; we went into the chicken coops and fed the chickens, and then slept from four to eight instead of having to get up at the usual time of six.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">WH: It must have been hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">CL: Well, we were young and energetic, and we needed it.</span> <span id="s55">I mean, you couldn’t just live on a farm and live with the chickens all the time.</span> <span id="s56">We didn’t go to Philadelphia for cultural life, though.</span> <span id="s57">Philadelphia was more for shopping.</span> <span id="s58">They used to have tryouts there.</span> <span id="s59">So you went to the theater and you saw five flops before you could see one good show.</span> <span id="s60">If you’re limited with the time you can spend, it’s difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">WH: Were your parents religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">CL: No.</span> <span id="s63">They were very progressive people.</span> <span id="s64">They were Zionists.</span> <span id="s65">Yitzhak Greenberg came to our town.</span> <span id="s66">They were very actively involved in Zionist and organizational work.</span> <span id="s67">They created a Hebrew school for us.</span> <span id="s68">My husband’s family was religious, Belzer Hasidim.</span> <span id="s69">I didn’t speak Yiddish until I met my husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">WH: Did most of the people here have prior farming experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">CL: Eighty percent of the people were my age, in their early twenties.</span> <span id="s72">All of us either stopped going to school at the fifth grade, sixth grade, tenth grade, or eleventh grade, tops.</span> <span id="s73">About 20% had higher education.</span> <span id="s74">Not only were we urban, but we were children who went through a terrible experience, and who had to start life in a new country with no parental supervision, no guidance.</span> <span id="s75">It wasn’t easy; it was like a hit and miss thing.</span> <span id="s76">We didn’t stay in New York because we had these friends here.</span> <span id="s77">And life here was simple and good.</span> <span id="s78">We made friends as we went along and we loved it.</span> <span id="s79">It was exciting because we were doing things together, helping each other.</span> <span id="s80">We had a certain kind of camaraderie.</span> <span id="s81">It was a challenge.</span> <span id="s82">My sister went to Brooklyn College and stayed in New York.</span> <span id="s83">She’s now a translator.</span> <span id="s84">My other sister lives in Toronto.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">WH: Did you go to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">CL: I was in night school two weeks and then I said to my husband: “I’m not going there anymore.</span> <span id="s87">They’re really acting like kids.”</span> <span id="s88">I said, “I’m a married woman and these other survivors are acting like kids.</span> <span id="s89">And I’m not learning anything.</span> <span id="s90">It’s too much like fun.”</span> <span id="s91">They would tell jokes and poke fun at the teacher in Yiddish and in Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">WH: What was the community like here?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">CL: It was like an extended family.</span> <span id="s94">People came from all different countries.</span> <span id="s95">We were so different from the rest of the community that people reached out to us and they then became part of our community and that’s when we also became part of the community.</span> <span id="s96">We became friendly with the suppliers.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">WH: Did the local farmers help you?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">CL: Very much.</span> <span id="s99">Without them, people like Dr. Theodore Norman, we couldn’t have made it.</span> <span id="s100">The JAS gave people personal loans.</span> <span id="s101">But we, in our own organization, The Jewish Poultryman’s Association, also had a gemilas chesed fund for our own members.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">WH: Was there anti-Semitism here?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">CL: I didn’t experience any.</span> <span id="s104">We were strange, not only to the Gentiles here, but also to the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">WH: You know about this book, The Golden Egg by Arthur Goldhaft.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">CL: It was actually ghost-written by Meyer Levin.</span> <span id="s107">Goldhaft was a very colorful man.</span> <span id="s108">He had a very scientific mind.</span> <span id="s109">There was a big commotion about the book when it came out.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">WH: Yes, I remember that Meyer Levin apologized for offending the survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">CL: Did you find it offensive?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">WH: Not to me.</span> <span id="s113">I couldn’t really judge it.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">CL: Goldhaft did a lot for the farmers.</span> <span id="s115">He described the mistakes made by the Europeans in farming.</span> <span id="s116">And it was kind of cute, but people were offended.</span> <span id="s117">But a lot of the commotion was directed, I think, at my husband because he wrote a lot about Miles Lerman.</span> <span id="s118">Miles did everything he could to create this organization.</span> <span id="s119">He is, by nature, a leader.</span> <span id="s120">He’s always involved in constructive things.</span> <span id="s121">The man has done so much for the Jewish community that he doesn’t have to explain himself to anybody.</span> <span id="s122">And the man wrote in the book that Miles Lerman is the only one who knows anything about farming and when you look at Miles Lerman and his beautiful wife and healthy children and whatever, blah, blah, blah.</span> <span id="s123">So people said: “We are so incapable and our lives are not beautiful, and our children are so sick?”</span> <span id="s124">Things like that.</span> <span id="s125">And this is foolishness.</span> <span id="s126">Miles was the founder and first president of the poultry farmer’s association.</span> <span id="s127">In 1949 my husband was already involved with UJA.</span> <span id="s128">Although Goldhaft and Levin apologized it wasn’t enough for some people.</span> <span id="s129">They ostracized my husband.</span> <span id="s130">It was like a mob psychology.</span> <span id="s131">And that was it.</span> <span id="s132">But we stayed and people realized that they made a mistake.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">WH: When did people start leaving the farm?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">CL: After Hurricane Hazel in 1955 (?)</span> <span id="s135">.</span> <span id="s136">People just abandoned the farms in some cases.</span> <span id="s137">Some people wanted a yeshiva.</span> <span id="s138">And then they started a yeshiva.</span> <span id="s139">It was mostly the survivors who started it.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">WH: Did most of the people come here directly?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">CL: About 30%, I would guess, came here directly through other people here but not on farmers’ quotas.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">WH: Did you stay in the farming business the whole time?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">CL: Until 1957.</span> <span id="s144">Then he decided it’s enough and he went into the oil distributing business.</span> <span id="s145">And he was successful and sold the business five years ago.</span> <span id="s146">And now he’s a real estate developer and is on the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council.</span> <span id="s147">He’s been negotiating the opening of the archives with the Russian and Polish governments.</span> <span id="s148">It was through his efforts that the Museum is getting all these things.</span> <span id="s149">He also chaired the project that brought together all the liberators from the different countries.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">WH: It was very hard on the farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">CL: Yes, but we did things.</span> <span id="s152">Did you hear what I said?</span> <span id="s153">Five o’clock we had the babysitter and then we went to New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">WH: Did most people do it?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">CL: I don’t know who did it.</span> <span id="s156">I know that when I went, I went to see Porgy and Bess when it first opened; I went to see Madame Butterfly at the Metropolitan Opera when it was still in Madison Square Garden.</span> <span id="s157">I went to see Inherit the Wind, with Paul Muni.</span> <span id="s158">I went to Second Avenue once and I promised myself not to go again because I couldn’t stand Menashe Skulnik (she laughs).</span> <span id="s159">We didn’t go every week, but we went two, three times a year because we needed it.</span> <span id="s160">We didn’t get a television until 1961 or 1962.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">WH: Do the memories of the Holocaust always remain?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">CL: They do and they will always be there, even though I’m an optimistic person.</span> <span id="s163">I still have nightmares and wake up screaming.</span> <span id="s164">I used to dream that I was running from the Nazis holding the children in my arms.</span> <span id="s165">But when I was in camp I was a child myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">WH: What about your children?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">CL: David was a very successful lawyer.</span> <span id="s168">He went to Harvard and then to Georgetown Law School.</span> <span id="s169">But now he’s a developer together with his father.</span> <span id="s170">He’s married to a Jewish girl from Corpus Christi.</span> <span id="s171">My daughter got a fine arts degree from Brandeis.</span> <span id="s172">She does documentaries, educational films.</span> <span id="s173">She’s single.</span> <span id="s174">Now she’s a Corporate V.P. for Communications at Burroughs.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">WH: Are there still survivor farmers today?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">CL: Not much.</span> <span id="s177">There are maybe only forty families left here.</span> <span id="s178">They may be involved in allied fields – processing, egg shelling, things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">WH: How many synagogues were there here?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">CL: Four – two Orthodox and two Conservative.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">WH: Was there a high intermarriage rate here?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">CL: No.</span> <span id="s183">Less among the survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">WH: Was one community better to live in than others, between say, Norma, Dorothy, Milmay, or Egg Harbor?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">CL: No.</span> <span id="s186">Each one had their own synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">WH: What did the war teach you?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">CL: How to decide quickly.</span> <span id="s189">And that no matter what decision you have to make in life, you have to be decisive.</span> <span id="s190">You go left, you go right.</span> <span id="s191">No matter what you do, you have to be pretty much in control of yourself.</span> <span id="s192">That I am by myself; I have no one to protect me or guide me and I’m the one who is making the decision and whatever the decision is going to be, it better work.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">WH: But you had your sisters.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">CL: That’s right.</span> <span id="s195">Without them I wouldn’t have survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Conclusion of
