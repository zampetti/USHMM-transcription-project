Selznick.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: Where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: I was born in a small village in Lithuania, Aniksht.</span> <span id="s19">Q: And, and where exactly is that located in Lithuania?</span> <span id="s20">A: It, it's located closer to the Latvian border.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: And when were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: I was born two weeks before the big fire, and that's all they knew.</span> <span id="s23">There was no papers.</span> <span id="s24">I was born in 1912, and in those days they had no documents in my village at all, so my father remembered that I was born two weeks before the big fire.</span> <span id="s25">When I became a teenager and about the time to serve in the Lithuanian army, a commission of doctors have moved their hand several times over my face, and with that, they established that I was born in 1912, because my, my face didn't have a beard yet.</span> <span id="s26">And they took a date of January first, 1912.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">And from there on, I was born on January first, 1912.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: Could you tell me a little about your childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: My childhood: I was the youngest son of a family of five sisters.</span> <span id="s30">My father was a, a, a peddler going to the vil -- to the farms and exchanging goods.</span> <span id="s31">And when I was hardly three years old, my father and mother wrapped me in a tallis and carried me a long distance to the rabbi's house.</span> <span id="s32">And there, he sat me down and taught me the Kometz aleph-beys.</span> <span id="s33">And as a reward, coins came down from heaven.</span> <span id="s34">And the first coin fell down, and -- I was excited and believed.</span> <span id="s35">But on the second coin, I lift up my head, I lift up eyes and I notice the rabbi stand over my, over my head, and I realized that it's not from heaven, but it's coming from the rabbi's hand.</span> <span id="s36">And that affected for the rest of my life my thinking about every aspect of life.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">1 Yiddish alphabet system where pronunciation is “O” under “aleph” (Yiddish).</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: In what way?</span> <span id="s40">That whatever you are being told is not necessarily correct.</span> <span id="s41">Q: Can you tell me a little about your education?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: In those days, the first rabbi -- which I just told you -- started with me to learn the kheder, the elementary Talmudistic study.</span> <span id="s43">After that, in those days -- it's about a hundred years ago, in the Jewish families, a boy was not supposed to have elementary education, and my father wanted me to be a rabbi.</span> <span id="s44">So gradually, when I was finished with the kheder, I was sent to a yeshiva.</span> <span id="s45">Since my village was too small to have a yeshiva, so I was sent to Vilkomir, a large city where I went to the yeshiva in Vilkomir.</span> <span id="s46">Since the custom was in those days that the yeshiva didn't had any cooking facilities, and -- every boy was by himself.</span> <span id="s47">And the custom was that the local residents were giving a day to eat.</span> <span id="s48">Each family gave one day to a Yeshiva bokher.And since my mother had relatives in Vilkomir who were some of the most established and wealthiest people, so I had pretty comfortable every day in the families where I was eating every day, except for Thursday.</span> <span id="s49">Thursday was my day with -- where my mother's aunt and cousin, two elderly widows, mother and daughter, who owned half of the property in Vilkomir.</span> <span id="s50">But they never gave me anything to eat.</span> <span id="s51">And I was arriving about nine o'clock in the morning for breakfast.</span> <span id="s52">After staying an hour and a half, and time to go back to the kheder and I was not supposed to be late to the yeshiva, and I was not supposed to be late in the yeshiva.</span> <span id="s53">And I was held -- when I was holding the handle in the door to walk out and saying to the Tante,"A guten Tag, Tante Esther.”</span> <span id="s54">That that's -- then, only then, she shouted from the other room, "A guten Tag, Dovid Yankele.</span> <span id="s55">Du vilst dokh vos zu essen?"</span> <span id="s56">"Would you want to eat something?"</span> <span id="s57">And by then it was too late, and I walked out.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">01:05:42</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: And this happened every Thursday?</span> <span id="s60">A: Every Thursday.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: Until what age were you at the yeshiva?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: I was in the yeshiva until about 12 years, from the age of six.</span> <span id="s63">So I was six years.</span> <span id="s64">Every, every session was six months.</span> <span id="s65">So I had about, about five to six years in the yeshiva, which is about 10 zmanim.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">2 After-hours Hebrew and religious instruction (Yiddish).</span></p> <p><span id="s67">3 Yeshiva student or Yeshiva boy (Yiddish).</span></p> <p><span id="s68">4 It should be noted that the Yiddish the interviewee speaks displays (as in the Yiddish pronunciation of Lithuanians who lived close to the former east Prussian border) considerable German inflections.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">5 “Good morning, Aunt Esther.”</span> <span id="s70">(Yiddish) 6 “Good morning, David Jacob.</span> <span id="s71">Would you like something to eat?”</span> <span id="s72">(Yiddish)</span></p> <p><span id="s73">7 Semesters (Yiddish)</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: And what, what happened when you were twelve years old?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: My father died.</span> <span id="s76">My father took sick.</span> <span id="s77">He was never sick in his life.</span> <span id="s78">He worked like a horse to support his wife and the five daughters.</span> <span id="s79">He didn't have to support me then because I was eating days in the yeshiva.</span> <span id="s80">And the first week he took sick, he died in three, four days.</span> <span id="s81">They sent a horse and buggy -- there was no, no motor vehicles in that time.</span> <span id="s82">And if there would have been already a bus or a truck that what would be cruising from Aniksht to Vilkomir, my family didn't have the money to pay.</span> <span id="s83">So a horse and buggy who was cruising constantly, twice a week from Aniksht to Vilkomir, picked me up to take me home.</span> <span id="s84">When I walked in in the house, the father's bed was standing in the middle of the living room.</span> <span id="s85">And I managed to come over to his bed and tell him, "Father, it's me, Dovid Yankele."</span> <span id="s86">And he managed to move his hand over my body with affection, and a few minutes later he was dead.</span> <span id="s87">The lederer Rov,the chief rabbi in Aniksht, who was this really holy man, he explain me that my father would have been dead three, four days ago -- the first or the second day he took sick -- except God kept him alive until the moment I arrive, and that's when he passed away.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: What happened to your family then?</span> <span id="s89">01:07:59</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: In that time, my father was extremely well-to-do.</span> <span id="s91">He had good days and bad days.</span> <span id="s92">But in that time, so happened that he had horses and chickens and, and, and, and cows.</span> <span id="s93">And the day he died, before the age of 12 or about, I suddenly became the old man of the family, and I had to take care not only of five grown-up sisters of mine and a constantly sick mother, but I had to take care of four horses and six cows and 12 chickens and porcupines.</span> <span id="s94">I had my own porcupine, who was still in the house.</span> <span id="s95">And I had to take care of all that.</span> <span id="s96">And it was a little too much for me.</span> <span id="s97">My older sister happened to have had escaped from Lithuania to deep Russia in the First World War, and she came back as a returnee.</span> <span id="s98">She had a husband and two children.</span> <span id="s99">All three of them died from hunger in her presence, so she was mentally slightly touched off.</span> <span id="s100">And when I decided to sell all the cows and all the horses and everything, to liquidate the properties, she became disturbed, and she grabbed a knife, and she was ready to stab me.</span> <span id="s101">And I escaped and came to the capital, Kovno, where one of my sisters was married by then already, and I stayed with her.</span> <span id="s102">And from there on, I developed myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: How old were you when you moved to Kovno?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: Well, that happened within a period of a few weeks or a few months.</span> <span id="s105">So I was about 14 -- 13 to 14 when that incident happened, and I came to Kovno.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: And once you got to Kovno?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">8 Rabbi (Yiddish)</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: I stayed for a little while with my married sister.</span> <span id="s109">And after that, I got myself a job as a messenger boy in different retail outlets.</span> <span id="s110">And from there on, I, I kept building my life the best way I can.</span> <span id="s111">All my other sisters were single, and they all had boyfriends.</span> <span id="s112">And all their boyfriends were ready to marry them except they refused to marry them without getting the dowry, which was the custom in the Jewish tradition in those days, which was called nadn.</span> <span id="s113">And without nadn, they weren't ready to marry them.</span> <span id="s114">We helped marry off my first sister by issuing "veksels,”which is promissory notes, of five thousand dollars for the two houses which we owned.</span> <span id="s115">Both houses were connected to each other, and there was a barn where we kept the cows and the horses in between the houses so you could walk from the inside.</span> <span id="s116">It was a valuable property in those days.</span> <span id="s117">So the promissory notes that we had, first my mother and I had to sign up to my first brother-in-law, otherwise he would not have married my sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">And he kept the notes in his -- under his pillow in his bed.</span> <span id="s119">So with the conniving of my married sister, we took out the notes from him and we gave it to the boyfriend of my second sister, and he married her.</span> <span id="s120">From thereon, we repeatedly did that all the time until all my sisters were married.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">01:12:10</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s123">And when you were living in Kovno, as you got older, what different kinds of jobs did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: Since I didn't had any schooling; it was forbidden while I was a yeshiva bokher to educate myself.</span> <span id="s125">And we were living eight boys in one room, for the sole purpose that the boys should spy on each other, or not one of the boys should do something wrong illegally.</span> <span id="s126">And reading a book in any language other than the Gemara was a illegal deed.</span> <span id="s127">So I had to have a candle, a lighted candle, covered with my blanket in order to read literature.</span> <span id="s128">And I tried to study, to educate myself.</span> <span id="s129">I gave up the study in yeshiva, because a student relative of mine in Vilkomir, by the name of Yankel Zibutz (ph) smuggled me in the life of Baruch Spinoza and Israel Acosta (ph).</span> <span id="s130">And when I was finished reading those two books under the candlelight covered in my bed at night, in the danger of burning down the whole village and the whole house, I realized that to be a yeshiva bokher and continue is not for me.</span> <span id="s131">I became a educated skeptic, and I gave up the study.</span> <span id="s132">And by then, my father died and it happened what it happened to me.</span> <span id="s133">So without any trade, I was too young for any trade or any occupation.</span> <span id="s134">So I was getting jobs in retail outlets to make deliveries, and I joined up a Yiddish cultural night school, where they was teaching people who didn't had the elementary schooling to be educated in the -- at night.</span> <span id="s135">And that is my -- what I had.</span> <span id="s136">After working for several retail outlets, I finally got myself a job in a office supply retail outlet by a childless couple.</span> <span id="s137">And they, more or less, treated me like their own child.</span> <span id="s138">And I grew up with them, and became a adult with those people.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: Can you tell me what happened as you moved into your 20s?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">9 Dowry (Hebrew) 10 Promissory note, IOU (Yiddish)</span></p> <p><span id="s141">01:15:00</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: As I moved into my 20s … I -- being engaged in a office products company, and where the Lithuanian intellectuals, under the leadership of the priests and the, and the educated people started a tremendous antisemitic hate campaign towards the Jews.</span> <span id="s143">And the office products company were the first victims, because it was only and primarily the government institutions like the Foreign Ministry and the Diplomatic Ministry and the Internal Ministry, and all the other government agencies who were the prime customers of the office supply companies.</span> <span id="s144">And the government and the fascist Siauliaitist party kept sending pickets to picket some of the Jewish stores so gentiles should not come in.</span> <span id="s145">And the government instructions was not to buy from Jews.</span> <span id="s146">I attempted, with the help of the proprietors of the company, to do something in that respect.</span> <span id="s147">And I took a trip to my village, which was Aniksht.</span> <span id="s148">And there, I discussed with a gentile former childhood friend of mine by the name of Jonas Kovalisch (ph), and I encouraged him to come to Kovno and to buy out the existing retail outlet.</span> <span id="s149">And he lined up a, a, another gentile gentleman by the name of Jonas Svinkeviches (ph), who was a former publisher of the, of dictionaries and other books, and was not engaged in that time in any business.</span> <span id="s150">And the two of them bought out the company, and it became a pure Christian company.</span> <span id="s151">And they became extremely successful because all the agencies of the government institutions immediately start to buy from them.</span> <span id="s152">I still remained with the company as a inside man in the, in the closed, in the -- in the locked -- locked inside quarters, far away from the eye of the public.</span> <span id="s153">And yet, the very same purchasing agents of the very same government agencies who were placing the orders, refused to deal with the pure Lithuanian Christian employees, and they dealt only with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">01:18:15</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: And this was shortly before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: That was up until 1933.</span> <span id="s157">In 1933, it became more and more difficult, and my position with the company became more and more difficult because people didn't stay in their job very long.</span> <span id="s158">People got old.</span> <span id="s159">People got married.</span> <span id="s160">They moved away.</span> <span id="s161">So new employees came in the purchasing departments, and they didn't want to be bothered with buying, with, with taking care of, with me helping them take care of.</span> <span id="s162">So my position became more or less obsolete.</span> <span id="s163">So Jonas Kowalisch (ph) decided, with my consent, that instead of keeping me in Kovno on the job which I had no, no, no purpose anymore and there was no way how I could get any other existence, he decided to send me on a trip to America.</span> <span id="s164">Since the relationship was so good with all the government agencies, he made me make an appointment with the protocol chief of the Foreign Ministry in Kovno.</span> <span id="s165">And when I had the appointment with that gentlemen, he told me, "David, I'll give you diplomatic papers that you are a diplomatic courier.</span> <span id="s166">I'll give you two suitcases, where you'll deliver to the Lithuanian Embassy in Kovno in New York -- or to the Lithuanian Consulate in New York.</span> <span id="s167">And you will travel as a diplomatic courier, and you'll be able to get a visa and come in to the United States.</span> <span id="s168">If I will not have -- and I certainly will not have -- any documents to send it to you -- with you.</span> <span id="s169">I will put in newspapers and fill it in."</span> <span id="s170">And that's what happened.</span> <span id="s171">I got a visa.</span> <span id="s172">I arrived to America.</span> <span id="s173">I delivered the two suitcases to the Consul General, to the Lithuanian Consul General, in New York.</span> <span id="s174">And I went to my, my family from Bedford Hills picked me up, and I stayed there for a short period of time.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: But then you went back to Lithuania?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: No, I did not go back to Lithuania.</span> <span id="s177">And then, when my immigration, when my visa time expired, I discovered that if you have fifty dollars in your pocket, you can take any transportation and arrive in Lisbon without any documents, in Lisbon, Portugal, without any visas or any documents.</span> <span id="s178">Or maybe they did require some kind of a paper where you would get where you get it in the, in the Portuguese Consulate in New York.</span> <span id="s179">I had the fifty dollars.</span> <span id="s180">I arranged everything, and I took a boat, and two weeks later, I arrived in Lisbon.</span> <span id="s181">And I attempt to get established over there, to build up my existence.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">01:21:40</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: Um-hm, and what happened then?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: After a while -- by then it was already closer to 1936.</span> <span id="s185">After a while, the sit- the situation in eastern Europe, particularly Lithuania and the three Baltic states -- Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia -- became extremely dangerous.</span> <span id="s186">Vul-vulnerable from Hitler's part and from Stalin's part.</span> <span id="s187">Those three Baltic countries are like a little kitten squeezed in between a lion and a hippopotamus.</span> <span id="s188">And I felt that my five sisters -- I'm sorry -- by then it was only four sisters, because one of my brother-in-laws, my youngest sister Hanke (ph), was a leftist activist in Kovno.</span> <span id="s189">And Lithuania was a fascist government under the rule of President Smetona.And he was in danger to be arrested and be imprisoned for a long, long time -- escaped to South America, to Uruguay.</span> <span id="s190">And three, four months after he arrived in Uruguay, he sent papers for my sister.</span> <span id="s191">So the two of them were in Uruguay.</span> <span id="s192">So I was left with four sisters.</span> <span id="s193">I realized that if anything happens, anything dramatic happens to Kovno or to Lithuania, all my four sisters, with all their four husbands -- each of them had four or five children -- and with all their children -- and my mother, my mother must have been 70 years by then.</span> <span id="s194">They will be destroyed in 10 minutes after anything happened, without me and my supervision and my ability to survive.</span> <span id="s195">So I voluntarily left Portugal to go back to Lithuania to be with my family.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">01:24:00</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: And what happened when you got back?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: When I arrived there, I became a volun-- a, a free-lance business representative.</span> <span id="s199">I had friends 11 Antanas Smetona was the leader of the fascist Gelezinis Vilkas (Iron Wolf) movement and president of Lithuania since 1926.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">in every industry -- in the garment industry, in the office product industry.</span> <span id="s201">I had a assistant by the name of Jonas Petronis (ph).</span> <span id="s202">He was a pure Christian.</span> <span id="s203">And here began the antisemitic drive.</span> <span id="s204">The hate towards the Jews became stronger and stronger with the influence of Hitler.</span> <span id="s205">And no Jewish office supply storekeeper, or stationery storekeeper, could ever survive anymore.</span> <span id="s206">In the hundreds and hundreds of villages in Lithuania, every dru -- every little store was selling school supplies for the schools.</span> <span id="s207">The written or non-written instructions -- I don't know which one it is -- came that no school in any community in Lithuania should purchase office products as school supplies from the Jewish storekeepers.</span> <span id="s208">So the Catholic hierarchy in Kovno, where it's the headquarters of all the hate towards the Jews, decided to open up a wholesale office product business to supply all the school systems in Lithuania with office products and school supplies and books.</span> <span id="s209">By that, they took away by itself automatically all the business from the Jewish store keepers.</span> <span id="s210">And my friend, Jonas Petronis (ph) became -- the, the priests and the prelates, they had nothing to do with the office products.</span> <span id="s211">What did they know about office products?</span> <span id="s212">So he became the general director of all the off -- of all the imports of the office product supplies in Lithuania, for the whole Lithuanian region.</span> <span id="s213">And ,naturally, being one of the few non-Jewish-hating Lithuanians, he immediately made me the -- appointed me to be the general representative, or independent dealer, on all the products what they had.</span> <span id="s214">I was able to buy wholesale, and I was able to sell to the Jewish retail storekeepers and to the non-Jewish retail, and to provide myself with a decent existence.</span> <span id="s215">I, I have to stop for a second.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">01:27:12</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: Sure.</span> <span id="s218">Take a drink of water… You can continue when ever you’re ready A: I'm ready.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: What, what happened next?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: That was in about 1936, towards the end of 1936.</span> <span id="s221">Where I build myself my existence through the means I just explained you and were as comfortable as anybody could be.</span> <span id="s222">I supported all my sisters' families where they were spread out all over Lithuania.</span> <span id="s223">One of my sisters remained in Aniksht.</span> <span id="s224">Another sister was living in Jonava.</span> <span id="s225">A third sister was living in Kovno, in the suburb of Kovno called Slobodka; and a fourth sister was in Aleksotas.</span> <span id="s226">And with the grace of Jonas Petronis (ph), I was very successful in my business.</span> <span id="s227">I'm sorry, I'd like to correct myself.</span> <span id="s228">With the grace of the one of the few decent, non-Jewish-hating Christians, Jonas Petronis (ph), I was able to become very successful and help all my family, and help all the people with whom I was ever involved in business, and many of my friends.</span> <span id="s229">Financial resource was no object with me at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: Were you trying at that point to get your family out of Lithuania?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: There was no way how to make any attempt to get out the family of Lithuania.</span> <span id="s232">The whole world was closed for Lithuanian Jews.</span> <span id="s233">As a matter of fact, the day of the ti -- the day of the out-outbreak of the war between Hitler and Stalin, there were there were extremely wealthy Jews walking around with foreign passports and foreign visas to go in any part of the world.</span> <span id="s234">And they couldn't go because Lithuania wouldn't let them out.</span> <span id="s235">And the consul of the prospective countries, who gave out the visas because of decency and humane reasons, knew before he gave them the visas that those countries wouldn't let them in.</span> <span id="s236">There was no way for me to attempt to take out my family or myself.</span> <span id="s237">I came in.</span> <span id="s238">I came in to the, to the, to the -- voluntarily from a free country like Portugal to this situation, because I knew that my family would not have survived any difficulty without me.</span> <span id="s239">But to attempt to get out, there was no way.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">01:30:40</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: Can you tell me what happened when the war started, when Germany invaded Poland?</span> <span id="s242">What happened to you in Lithuania?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: What happened to me is, in Vilijampole, where my sister in Vilijampole, where my sister lived was the heart of the Jewish poor population in Kovno.</span> <span id="s244">The popularity -- the population -- was mostly Jewish.</span> <span id="s245">All the great famous yeshivas were there.</span> <span id="s246">And when the war broke out, it took three days and three nights that the German were not able to step in in the villages, in Kovno and in other villages, because the fronts were going on fightings between the Russian Army and the German Army.</span> <span id="s247">But the civil Russian popula-- government in every community, including Kovno and Vilijampolis, disintegrated within a half a day of the first outbreak of the war, which was the night of June 21st, 1941.</span> <span id="s248">In those three days and three nights, with the Russian might disappeared suddenly within one day.</span> <span id="s249">All the functionaries of the Russian government and Party had their trucks and their buses and other means of transportation stacked away somewhere.</span> <span id="s250">And when it happened, they all packed up their families and they left.</span> <span id="s251">And the population was left without any mercy at all.</span> <span id="s252">And it's the Lithuanian fascists, who were prepared for all the time since the Russian rule was in Kovno, secretly, by the Nazi agents to have uniforms and ammunition.</span> <span id="s253">So the first half a hour after the outbreak of the war that there was no more Russian might, the Lithuanian fascists -- they called themselves Siauliaitists or Siaulitists (ph), I don't know exactly -- the very same organization who before the war was doing all the anti-Jewish activities, they were within one half an hour in uniforms.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">01:33:40 And they marched in in Slobodka; and they murdered the most brutal, the most unbelieved inhumanely torturous way almost all the population, the Jewish population, in that community.</span> <span id="s255">I was supposed to be there, too, and I was supposed to be murdered.</span> <span id="s256">And I know that there's no reason why I would have a better human being than everybody, where all my friends were murdered.</span> <span id="s257">Except for one thing.</span> <span id="s258">Being a volun -- free.</span> <span id="s259">Being a independent representative in the office products field, where I was selling to the retail outlets and I had a tremendous fine relationship with all the employees in the companies with whom I did business.</span> <span id="s260">And one of the companies, the employee manager – a, a Jewish girl by the name of Hinda – Hindale (ph), she was a member of the Communist Party.</span> <span id="s261">She was a member of the Executive Committee of the Communist Party.</span> <span id="s262">And as soon as the Communist, Communist rule took over the power in Kovno -- that was about 1940, about a year prior to the outbreak of the war -- she called me.</span> <span id="s263">It's about a week and a half, about a week prior to the start of the war.</span> <span id="s264">She called me that there's a meeting of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, and my name was put on to be sent to Siberia.</span> <span id="s265">For months and months and months, or weeks and weeks, the secret police used to ring the bell in the, in the most of the Jewish houses, pack them up, send them to the station and send them to Siberia.</span> <span id="s266">There was no way of telling who will be next to go.</span> <span id="s267">Since of my attitude being extremely polished and friendly with everybody, one of these, one of the highest activists of the Communist Party was constantly imprisoned by the Lithuanian.</span> <span id="s268">And he was a, a -- and his background was the office product industry, and his family was known.</span> <span id="s269">And Hindale was the one who was collecting money from me to support his family, and to support other families, and the other of the imprisoned political prisoners, Jewish or non-Jewish.</span> <span id="s270">I gave to everybody generously, so she knew exactly who I was.</span> <span id="s271">And there were a great deal of members of the Central Committee of the Communist Pa -- Kovno Lithuanian Communist Party, who also knew about my activities as a human being.</span> <span id="s272">And she called me and informed me that I am on the list to be taken to Siberia.</span> <span id="s273">There was a mi-- a, a minority rule vote against taking me out, but the majority won.</span> <span id="s274">And she suggested to me that the person from whose family I helped support -- I don't know his name, he became the head of the rectory of the vacation.</span> <span id="s275">He became the Commissioner of the head of the vacation for the whole commercial enterprises in Kovno.</span> <span id="s276">And since I was - - had to take a job by then already, because I also was advised by inside information that it's not healthy for me to be a free-lance representative, so they appointed a job for me in one of the retail outlets.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">01:38:08 I became the prekiau (ph) zinaviets(ph) -- the merchandise specialist.</span> <span id="s278">So she suggested to me I thought I should call that gentleman and ask him to grant me a vacation, because I didn't feel good.</span> <span id="s279">I called him in his office, I made an appointment with him the same day to have dinner with him in a restaurant.</span> <span id="s280">I explained to him that I don't feel good.</span> <span id="s281">I happen physically to suffer from psoriasis.</span> <span id="s282">And all I had to do is unroll my sleeve and scratch a little in my, in my, in my joint area that it becomes white, to convince him that I am what I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">And he saw it.</span> <span id="s284">He called me the next day, and suggested that there's two openings for me on vacation.</span> <span id="s285">One was in Sochi, in Crimo-Cacausus-- the most luxury resort area in Russia, where Stalin personally had one of his villas.</span> <span id="s286">And I certainly shivered away from that.</span> <span id="s287">The next place was Druskininkai, a resort area, a very famous resort area which belonged to Lithuania five hundred years ago at the time when Lithuania ruled a great deal of eastern 12 In Lithuanian, the word for merchandise is “prekes.”</span> <span id="s288">The word for knowledge is “zinojimas.”</span> <span id="s289">The interviewee’s alteration of the endings of both words is probably due to a vernacular not present in our dictionaries.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">13 Located on the Black Sea, very near the border between the Russian S.F.S.R. and Georgia.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Europe.</span> <span id="s292">And in 1918-20, in the war between the Lithuanian's independent and Poland's independent, a Polish general occupied the whole territory with this Lithuanian capital of Vilna, and it became Polish.</span> <span id="s293">And I accepted to go to Druskininkai.</span> <span id="s294">Since I am a person of -- I never believed in delaying matters and in being sloppy, whatever I do, I immediately accepted the permit and that was on Monday night.</span> <span id="s295">Tuesday, I took the train to Druskininkai.</span> <span id="s296">I arrived there late Tuesday night.</span> <span id="s297">I registered in the hotel with all the formalities.</span> <span id="s298">And Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday night, I was dancing in a nightclub with the, with the wife of a Russian colonel -- the head of the Com-- of the whole Russian Army in that area.</span> <span id="s299">And we walked out 12 o'clock midnight, and we hear tremendous thunder.</span> <span id="s300">And she said that, "These maneuvers… my husband told me that we may have maneuvers."</span> <span id="s301">And I said, "No, that's not maneuvers.</span> <span id="s302">That is some kind of a war."</span> <span id="s303">And I went straight to the hotel.</span> <span id="s304">And a few minutes after I arrived to the hotel, the loudspeaker heard already Molotov's speech that war broke out.</span> <span id="s305">I think we'll have a little recess.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: Ok, go ahead.</span> <span id="s307">The tape, the first tape is going to end in about fifteen minutes, and at that point we can walk around and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION – PAUSE 01:42:10</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: Why don't you just continue whenever you're ready.</span> <span id="s310">Continue whenever you're ready.</span> <span id="s311">What, what happened once the war broke out?</span> <span id="s312">What, what happened to you now?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: I will continue.</span> <span id="s314">Oh, sorry.</span> <span id="s315">Can I stand up for a minute?</span> <span id="s316">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION</span></p> <p><span id="s317">01:43:38</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: Sure.</span> <span id="s319">You can go ahead whenever you're ready… Ok, why don't, why don't we pick up about where – what, what happened to you once --</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: When the war broke out?</span> <span id="s321">Q: When the war broke out.</span> <span id="s322">01:44:15</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: Since I was a fairly well-to-do person, and without a family, as soon as the Communists took over Lithuania, everybody in Lithuania, every -- but everybody had to look like Stalin, to make themselves a Stalin jacket and high boots, and pants with, with -- how do you call it?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">14 Molotov, Vyachelslav (1890-1986) Rider pants, whatever it was.</span> <span id="s325">So I, I had tailor-made luxury black ankle leather coats, with high boots, with Stalinuvka(ph) jackets.</span> <span id="s326">And at the time when Molotov's speech was delivered, the tens of thousands of vacationers, they're starting to run around in chaotic -- a mad situation.</span> <span id="s327">And nobody know what to do, and nobody knew where to go.</span> <span id="s328">And I immediately decided that I will start to escape in the only highway road which was near the resort area.</span> <span id="s329">And I walked out with my beautiful black raincoat, dressed in the beautiful boots to look like a commissar.</span> <span id="s330">And after 10, 15 minutes walking, my feet were already crippled, and I had to throw away the boots and walk barefoot.</span> <span id="s331">I walked for an hour this way.</span> <span id="s332">While passing by -- that was in the middle of the night -- there was a water well.</span> <span id="s333">And thousands of people were laying around the water well, hanging around.</span> <span id="s334">There was a school of Russian students.</span> <span id="s335">I don't remember what kind of school.</span> <span id="s336">It was a vocational school.</span> <span id="s337">And the boys who were who were taking out the water from the well wore uniforms.</span> <span id="s338">And the thousands of people had stretched out their hands to get a drink of water.</span> <span id="s339">I had some properties with me, and in the properties I had built in two very, very expensive diamonds.</span> <span id="s340">I prepared myself for that kind of even-eventuality in many situations.</span> <span id="s341">In, in a dry shaving soap container, like a little, like a little roller.</span> <span id="s342">And I took that out and stretched out my hand to hand over to the boys; and within two seconds, I got the water.</span> <span id="s343">And I continued.</span> <span id="s344">Daybreak came, and by then I was half-dead.</span> <span id="s345">I couldn't walk anymore.</span> <span id="s346">I was on a field where thousands of people were laying stretched out on the field, already half-dead from the same difficulty of walking barefoot.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">01:48:00 And the German airplanes came flying over the field.</span> <span id="s348">And a lot of people were shoving themselves through their bodies crawling, with the hope that they will be able to crawl closer to the bombs and get killed so they die, but it didn't happen to me.</span> <span id="s349">And it just so happened that by then I was near a road where thousands of refugees were running towards Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">That highway was closer to Russia.</span> <span id="s351">Those borders, in those days, the, the, the, the national territories that a little, a little highway, a little road -- here was Poland, five seconds later it was Ukrainia, and, and a little bit further it was Byelorussia.</span> <span id="s352">It was all part of the same territories.</span> <span id="s353">So I happened to be lying near the, the route, near the road, where a Jewish family with a horse and buggy, with some children and women were on the, on the, on the, on the wagon, and men were walking with the wagon.</span> <span id="s354">And one of the women noticed me.</span> <span id="s355">And she started to cry and forced the man to put me on the wagon.</span> <span id="s356">And on the wagon, they bandaged my feet and powdered it.</span> <span id="s357">And I recuperated.</span> <span id="s358">And after traveling all day and almost a half a night, wherever we went the Germans were ahead of us.</span> <span id="s359">Finally we land up a village in Ukraine.</span> <span id="s360">We were in a barn of a, of a Ukrainian farmer house.</span> <span id="s361">It was then already forbidden by Jews to take in wandering Jews.</span> <span id="s362">So the Ukrainian had mercy with us and took us in the barn.</span> <span id="s363">And I remember if it happened today, right now, that his two grown-up sons were busy in the village robbing the Jewish properties.</span> <span id="s364">And the old man -- he must have been eighty, ninety years old -- stood for hours in the doorway of his barn where we were laying, with a, with a stick like a baseball stick over his shoulder, ready to beat his sons when they'll be</span></p> <p><span id="s365">15 Stalinká jackets.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">finished robbing the Jewish houses in the village and when they will come back home to stop them from going in in the barn and kill us and take away the properties what those people had with whom I was attached.</span> <span id="s367">I had no properties again at all anymore, so there was nothing to take from me.</span> <span id="s368">All they could do is kill me.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">01:57:20 After we left this property, we continued riding further and further and further.</span> <span id="s370">And we didn't manage to go very far, where we stopped at another house.</span> <span id="s371">And I, I was relaxed already and almost everything in my foot healed, except one area which was bleeding.</span> <span id="s372">And I was sitting in the front of the house.</span> <span id="s373">I think the house, the people in the house what made me do something in the front -- clean a pot, I don't remember what.</span> <span id="s374">And a group of German soldiers stopped and asked me, "Du Jude?</span> <span id="s375">"And I said, "Jude."</span> <span id="s376">And they took me with them.</span> <span id="s377">They took me to a, to a, to a, to a fairly decent-looking residence.</span> <span id="s378">And it was vacant, and they made me scrub the floor.</span> <span id="s379">It was the headquarters for the commanding general to stopover when he will arrive.</span> <span id="s380">They were preparing the headquarters.</span> <span id="s381">And since one of the guards noticed my bleeding foot, they called in the military doctor and he bandaged my foot.</span> <span id="s382">In the meantime, he bought something to eat.</span> <span id="s383">And after I was finished cleaning, they took me back to the place where they picked me up.</span> <span id="s384">By then, it was too late to go anywhere, because the routes were bombed and destroyed and the Germans were everywhere.</span> <span id="s385">So the family, the family from Grodno to whom I attached myself, decided to go back to Grodno.</span> <span id="s386">And it took us several days.</span> <span id="s387">And we arrived in Grodno.</span> <span id="s388">Shortly before we came to the proper city in Grodno, there was the gendarmes, the military gendarmes, who were controlling the traffic.</span> <span id="s389">And they stepped -- they stopped us and identified a whole group as Jews and took us straight to the prison.</span> <span id="s390">And from there, they kept us for a day or so.</span> <span id="s391">And since the whole family was in Grodno, resident family, they let them all go -- including me.</span> <span id="s392">So I stayed for a few days with that family.</span> <span id="s393">Shortly afterwards, few -- I rested for a day or so.</span> <span id="s394">And then I -- they told me -- I spoke no Polish.</span> <span id="s395">So the family with whom I was staying discovered that there are thousands of refugees are lined up in the front of the German commandant to get passes to go back to their homes.</span> <span id="s396">Where do you have that many thousands of refugees?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Because Druskininkai, the resort area where I was, was a resort area only for, for vacationers.</span> <span id="s398">There were dozens of hotels only for vacationers.</span> <span id="s399">And there were many other resort hotels in that area.</span> <span id="s400">So thousands, and maybe tens of thousands of Russian laborers and employees who had a vacation lined up over there and were caught in the war.</span> <span id="s401">And they all lined up in Grodno, in the front of the Kommandantur to get passes to go home.</span> <span id="s402">And I did the same thing.</span> <span id="s403">The procedure was: there was a big street, no traffic, it was blocked off; across the street of the building of the Kommandantur, the thousands of people were staying and waiting in line.</span> <span id="s404">There were several German guards who controlled the traffic of the people.</span> <span id="s405">And when a group of 10, 20 people walked out from the Kommandantur, that means they took care of their business.</span> <span id="s406">The guards permitted a group of these other 10, 20 people to go in.</span> <span id="s407">Since thousands of people were waiting on the other side and the guard doesn't designate who should come in, so the thousands of them was starting to run.</span> <span id="s408">So the guards 16 “Are You a Jew?”</span> <span id="s409">(German) were controlling the outside.</span> <span id="s410">They let that many people in, and they did not permit any more.</span> <span id="s411">And the rest of them went back.</span> <span id="s412">That repeated itself several times a day.</span> <span id="s413">I was there for one day, and I think a second day.</span> <span id="s414">After that, the rule came out that every Jew should wear a Star of David.</span> <span id="s415">And the Grodno family made up Stars of David on the front and on the back, and they made a set of Star of Davids for me, too.</span> <span id="s416">So the next morning, six o'clock in the morning, I arrived at the, at the line-up place, already with my Star of David.</span> <span id="s417">I am not a tall person.</span> <span id="s418">And between the husky big people without the Star of David, I would never had a opportunity to get there because as groups of people got their, their fulfillment, new groups of people arrived to wait for the police.</span> <span id="s419">A day passed by.</span> <span id="s420">Although nobody ever attempted to offend me at all, while I was standing, but when I started to run with all the other people to get in, that's when they pushed me aside and did not let me go near it.</span> <span id="s421">And one day, I think, two days passed by.</span> <span id="s422">Early morning on the third day, when I lined up together with all the other people, the German guard walked over to me and said, "Du, Jude, komm.</span> <span id="s423">"And he walked me through the gate, and while walking he said to me, "Die Schweine, die, die, die Russians!</span> <span id="s424">Ich hab gesehen was ist – was angeht, und du hast niemals die Gelegenheit durchzugehen."</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: Can you translate that?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: I was the only Jew with the Star of David waiting for a permission to go through.</span> <span id="s427">And he realized there's so much going on.</span> <span id="s428">And he walked me through the Kommandantur.</span> <span id="s429">I walked in, in the corridor, and the officer was sitting at the desk.</span> <span id="s430">And I explained to him in German that I'm, I'm going to the Kommandantur to ask a permit to go back from Kovno, to go back to Kovno.</span> <span id="s431">And he told me to go on the second floor, I'll see the people there, I'll know where to go in.</span> <span id="s432">And I did walk in, and my turn came after a little while.</span> <span id="s433">And another elderly German officer was sitting at, at the desk, and he and a civilian Pole was standing next to him.</span> <span id="s434">Since all the applicants for permission to go home were not Poles -- they were Russian and Ukrainian, and all, all other people and all nationalities.</span> <span id="s435">Poles had no need to ask permission to go home, because that was their home at that moment.</span> <span id="s436">So, naturally, the Commandant had an interpreter.</span> <span id="s437">And I was the only Jew who came over.</span> <span id="s438">And the Polish interpreter attempted immediately to explain the Commandant, in his broken Pol—German - - that I am a Communist and I should be shot right away.</span> <span id="s439">My ear was very clear then.</span> <span id="s440">I stood up like, like "Achtung!"</span> <span id="s441">-- you know, like "Attention!"</span> <span id="s442">-- and I said to the Commandant, "Der Mann lügt!</span> <span id="s443">Ich bin ein, ein, ein -- ich bin hier für Erholung in Druskininkai, und bin in dem middle auf dem Ausbruch, auf dem Krieg, von Kovno, Lithuanien.</span> <span id="s444">Und ich bitte dem Commandant erlauben es zurückziehen nach Kovno.</span> <span id="s445">"The man took a look at me, picked up his stamp, stamped on a paper, and out I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">17 “You, Jew, come.”</span> <span id="s447">(German) 18 “The swine, the, the, the Russians!</span> <span id="s448">I have seen what is going on, and you have no chance to go through.”</span> <span id="s449">(German) 19 "The man lies!</span> <span id="s450">I have been an, an, an -- I am here for rehabilitation at Druskininkai and have been caught in the middle of the escape from Kovno, Lithuania.</span> <span id="s451">And if the commandant will allow, will return to Kovno."</span> <span id="s452">(German)</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: Ok, this is probably a good place to stop.</span> <span id="s454">We -- they -- have to change the tapes, so we can take a break now.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">02:00:40</span></p> <p><span id="s456">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s458">02:00:30</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: We’re ready to go back on.</span> <span id="s460">We left off with your getting permission to go back to Kovno.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A: I went back to the family in Grodno.</span> <span id="s462">They, they gave me a little food to go, and the next day in the morning I started off to go on foot towards Lithuania, which people suggested the route I should take.</span> <span id="s463">There's not traffic.</span> <span id="s464">I was the only one going on that route, and no walkers, nothing.</span> <span id="s465">I was just by myself.</span> <span id="s466">I walked all day long and rested for a while.</span> <span id="s467">It was -- by then, it was in mid-- in mid-July, and it was extremely hot.</span> <span id="s468">And from time to time, I rested.</span> <span id="s469">I became thirsty, but I had nowhere out to drink.</span> <span id="s470">And towards the evening, I arrived at the house.</span> <span id="s471">There wasn't even any houses where to stop.</span> <span id="s472">But that was a house, and I stopped.</span> <span id="s473">And they gave me something to eat and they gave me to drink, and I continued.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">And late at night I arrived back in Druskininkai.</span> <span id="s475">From there, I started off.</span> <span id="s476">And by then, was already a rule issued by the German authorities that no local resident should be permitted to take in a strange Jew in their houses, under the penalty of death.</span> <span id="s477">Then I stretched out on the sidewalk, laying there ready to die, whatever will happen to me.</span> <span id="s478">I was extremely exhausted from the walk.</span> <span id="s479">I was already again hungry and thirsty.</span> <span id="s480">And early in the morning -- I laid all night like that -- and early in the morning, at time when people were beginning to move around, there were two Jewish girls from Kovno who were also vacationing.</span> <span id="s481">They were nurses.</span> <span id="s482">I think they were sisters.</span> <span id="s483">And they saw me laying on the sidewalk.</span> <span id="s484">They recognized me.</span> <span id="s485">They came over, and they cried dramatically over me.</span> <span id="s486">But they couldn't help me, either.</span> <span id="s487">But they brought me some water, and something to eat.</span> <span id="s488">And I strengthened myself a little bit.</span> <span id="s489">And after a while, I was laying there again.</span> <span id="s490">I didn't have the strength to get up.</span> <span id="s491">And two girls passed by.</span> <span id="s492">And they passed me -- Christian girls -- they passed me by laughing and giggling.</span> <span id="s493">And while they passed me by, one of them made a remark.</span> <span id="s494">I don't remember why the remark was.</span> <span id="s495">And they came back, and that one girl recognized me.</span> <span id="s496">In the good days, prior -- about a year, a year and a half ago, when Hitler attacked Poland, thousands of Polish Jewish refugees find themselves in Lithuania.</span> <span id="s497">And one person from Warsaw, whom I became very friendly and sheltered him and helped him economically and to survive, happened to be a playboy.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">And he -- the girls were clinging to him like, like honey to a bee, and he had dates constantly.</span> <span id="s499">And since I was a single fellow, too, we had dates together.</span> <span id="s500">And I remember one weekend he arranged a date for me with two gentile girls whose sister was married to a Jewish musician in Kovno.</span> <span id="s501">And we had a beautiful evening together; but that was about a year ago of the time that I was laying on the sidewalk.</span> <span id="s502">And my date, one of the two girls we had a date, was that girl.</span> <span id="s503">How do you like that?!</span> <span id="s504">And she happened to be the sister of the Lithuanian chief of the organized partisan murderous bands, who were busy in that time not to bother with the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">02:05:12 Because in the Polish Ukrainian villages, the Lithuanian partisans who take over the power immediately were busy antagonizing or robbing or murdering the Poles.</span> <span id="s506">They had not -- they didn't have to bother with the Jews, because the Jews wouldn't run away from them.</span> <span id="s507">They had time plenty for the Jews later on.</span> <span id="s508">But her brother was the head of the organizers of the murderous partisan bands, who for participated in most of the destructive murders of Kovno -- including Slobodka, primarily Slobodka.</span> <span id="s509">Where if I would have been there, what I started to explain you originally.</span> <span id="s510">By all counts I should have been there.</span> <span id="s511">But because physically I happened to be in Druskininkai, so I wasn't murdered.</span> <span id="s512">So he brought me in his house.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: And then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: Then they gave me to eat and to drink, and they gave me some clothing.</span> <span id="s515">And he was getting ready to send a transport of additional murderers to Kovno, to continue with the beautiful work they did.</span> <span id="s516">And he instructed them to put me in the truck and to take me to Kovno.</span> <span id="s517">After all, I was his custody.</span> <span id="s518">And he instructed them, and he had told me, that on the highway they will be stopped by a German officer who was the real head chief of the, of the, of the Einsatzkommando.And he will give them additional instructions in writing and will converse with them.</span> <span id="s519">The German didn't speak Lithuanian, and the Lithuanian didn't speak German.</span> <span id="s520">But he will give them instructions what, additional instructions what to do in Kovno.</span> <span id="s521">Prior to this stop, where he was supposed to wait for them, the soldiers should put me underneath their feet between the benches.</span> <span id="s522">The truck had benches arranged for people to sit.</span> <span id="s523">And they should cover me up with their feet.</span> <span id="s524">And he explained me, too -- or his sister explained me -- that it will be stopped, and a German officer will talk German.</span> <span id="s525">I should not breath or make any sign of anything.</span> <span id="s526">I should stay still.</span> <span id="s527">And I did, and they passed by.</span> <span id="s528">The trip was a pretty long trip.</span> <span id="s529">It was almost a whole day.</span> <span id="s530">Towards the evening, they stopped in the front of a, of a farmhouse, or a restaurant, where they all went in to eat.</span> <span id="s531">And they took me in, too, and I ate with them.</span> <span id="s532">When they arrived in Kovno, on Vilna Street -- one of the main streets -- they just let me off.</span> <span id="s533">I'm finished.</span> <span id="s534">I'm finished, I -- their duty was over.</span> <span id="s535">That house was not far of the house where my brother-in-law's brother was living.</span> <span id="s536">So I walked in in that house, in their apartment.</span> <span id="s537">And there I find my sister with her two children, and my mother, from Jonava, with a niece of mine -- the one who survived.</span> <span id="s538">And there they -- I discovered the whole the whole story what happened.</span> <span id="s539">I would have been in Slobodka, in my sister's house.</span> <span id="s540">And they avoid that the brutal murder of the pogroms on the first three days.</span> <span id="s541">On the fourth day, a group of partisans, murderous, decided to go and check out from house to house.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">02:10:15 My sister happened to have lived in a attic.</span> <span id="s543">So the eight, nine men who were hiding were up there in that apartment -- my brother-in-law, his brother, his son and other people -- they're hiding in the attic.</span> <span id="s544">It was not the straight down roof where you could fold up.</span> <span id="s545">It was a attic roof like areas were straight, where people could lay down there.</span> <span id="s546">After they didn't find anybody, they all walked out.</span> <span id="s547">And some of the idiots inside decided to look from, on the 20 Task force (German) balcony, decided to look if it's all over.</span> <span id="s548">And the last partisan decided to look up, and they met each other.</span> <span id="s549">And they took them all down, and they took them to the Ninth Fortification.And they murdered them, together with most of the Jews that were murdered.</span> <span id="s550">You have to remember that this Fortification, the Seventh and the Ninth Fortification, was fortifications -- you know what a fortification is?</span> <span id="s551">Built by the Czarist Russia to pretend -- to prevent -- attacks from German armies in, in 1905.</span> <span id="s552">And they were still in existence.</span> <span id="s553">And the Lithuanian took them over, and that's where they murdered most of the Jews.</span> <span id="s554">They took them there.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: What, what happens to you next, now that you're back?</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: The next, the next thing what happened, I happened to have an apartment in Kovno.</span> <span id="s557">My mother, when I made the trip to Druskininkai for a vacation, my mother was living with me.</span> <span id="s558">She was taking care of the maid I had, and helping her.</span> <span id="s559">I didn't want my mother to be by herself.</span> <span id="s560">So I gave her money to buy gifts for all her daughters, and travel to visit from one daughter to the other.</span> <span id="s561">And the first stop she made was in Jonava, with my sister who had fou-four children.</span> <span id="s562">Over there, the first day the Jews were lined up from their apartments, driven to the forest and they were kept for several days.</span> <span id="s563">My then-70-years-old mother realized that nothing good will come out from the whole thing.</span> <span id="s564">And she grabbed Dinah's (ph) hand -- my oldest niece, my sister's oldest daughter -- and she pushed herself closer and closer to the forest.</span> <span id="s565">And when it became dark, she pulled out Dinah and they walked away.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">They were hiding during the day in the, in the, in the ravinas (ph).</span> <span id="s567">Ravina, that's a English word?</span> <span id="s568">Between the -- and during the night, they were walking.</span> <span id="s569">A woman who couldn't read and write, never went to a school, never know what a map means, managed to go from Janova to Kovno.</span> <span id="s570">And that's how they arrived in Kovno.</span> <span id="s571">They were hiding during the day, because they would have been caught by the partisans and murdered.</span> <span id="s572">And if there weren't any partisans, some of the decent Christians would have fingered them to the partisans and called over a murderer.</span> <span id="s573">So they arrived in Kovno.</span> <span id="s574">So I had already a built-in family of my sister Chayke (ph), whose husband was murdered in Slobodka, with her little girl, Raisele (ph), and a boy, Alenke (ph).</span> <span id="s575">The boy was six years old.</span> <span id="s576">The girl was about 12, 14.</span> <span id="s577">That was three people.</span> <span id="s578">My mother is four, and Dinahle (ph) then is five.</span> <span id="s579">So I had five dependents, on whose ability to survive depends on me only.</span> <span id="s580">After a while, the rule came out to go into Kovno ghetto.</span> <span id="s581">I, on the other hand, the minute when I heard what happened to my brother- in-law and their, and the, the other people -- and that had happened only three, four days before my arrival.</span> <span id="s582">Because they didn't murder them in the first three days of the onslaught.</span> <span id="s583">It was on the fourth day; and it was three -- it was seven days since the beginning.</span> <span id="s584">I decided to walk to the criminal police headquarters to attempt to speak to this chief of the criminal police, Mr. Pomatitis (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s585">02:14:04 My relationship with Pomatitis was as following: while I was the manager, so-called</span></p> <p><span id="s586">21 Ninth Fort manager of the new Christian office products store and his office was buying, and he personally was coming and place orders for me for 5,000 dollar carpets and other expensive properties and put in on the invoice "office products" to be sent to his home, it was a personal relationship between him and myself.</span> <span id="s587">Since I wasn’t some several times for business, and when I became the employee of the government store retail outlet, after the, the Communists took over, because I had to have a job, his wife was coming to the store to buy school supplies for the children.</span> <span id="s588">So she told me that he was imprisoned in the Kovno prison, and I realized that they had difficulty to survive.</span> <span id="s589">So I gave her money to buy the school supplies.</span> <span id="s590">I helped her with food, and I sent quite often hilf-- help -- to her house.</span> <span id="s591">My logic was, that when he was rel-- freed from prison from the Communists, and became again the chief of the police headquarters in Kovno, my logic was that she would have told him what I did.</span> <span id="s592">He knew who I am.</span> <span id="s593">And I think I'll take the, I'll take the risk and go to see him, and ask him if he can liberate my brother-in-law and all the people who were kept in that house.</span> <span id="s594">And that's what I did.</span> <span id="s595">In order to be secure, because it wasn't safe to walk through Kovno for the Lithuanian partisans who didn't know who I am and didn't care who I am, I had a distant relative -- a Jewish distant relative -- who was a former volunteer in the original Lithuanian Army.</span> <span id="s596">And that was a big honor by the Lithuanians, and he wore a little button on his--.</span> <span id="s597">With that, we were stopped a couple times going to the, to the police, to this.</span> <span id="s598">-- to the chief of police, to Mr. Pomatitis, which was all the way on the, on the, on the new part in Kovno, quite a distant.</span> <span id="s599">But we arrived.</span> <span id="s600">There were thousands of Jews waiting in the offices for appointments, and hundreds and hundreds of Lithuanian and other minorities who were waiting for their appointment.</span> <span id="s601">But when I informed the desk clerk that I came to see Mr.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Jonas Pomatitis, the chief of the police headquarters, within two seconds the assistant of the police, chief of police of Mr. Pomatitis came out and asked me my business, and I told him.</span> <span id="s603">He went back in; and came out and regretted that Mr. Pomatitis does not have the opportunity to come and speak to me.</span> <span id="s604">But he'll do everything he can, but he thinks it may be too late.</span> <span id="s605">And that's exactly what it was.</span> <span id="s606">It was too late.</span> <span id="s607">On the way back, we were stopped again by Lithuanian partisans, who were picking up Jews from all over.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">02:18:02 It was still permitted for Jews to walk on the street, but you had to have your star already.</span> <span id="s609">Or maybe by then it was not.</span> <span id="s610">I don't remember.</span> <span id="s611">But it wasn't hard for a Lithuanian to know who is a Jew in Kovno.</span> <span id="s612">They looked at the at the little button of my friend, and they pushed him away; and they took me to the prison, to the yellow prison, which was nearby.</span> <span id="s613">They kept me there for several hours.</span> <span id="s614">And then, with a group of hundreds of other Jews, they took me on the mountains in a former Russian caserne, a military unit.</span> <span id="s615">And they made me sort clothing.</span> <span id="s616">And when the day was over, they sent me back in Kovno.</span> <span id="s617">Then the decree came out that all Jews should go in in ghetto; and I made arrangements with my family to go to the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Since we had -- didn't have anything to transfer, it was for easier for us just to go Kovno to the apartment of my sister.</span> <span id="s619">She lived in ghetto in, in Slobodka, where it was supposed to be.</span> <span id="s620">The street she lived was supposed to be part of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s621">Before we did that, I decided to go</span></p> <p><span id="s622">22 Help (Yiddish).</span></p> <p><span id="s623">to my former apartment and see if there was anything I could recuperate.</span> <span id="s624">The superintendent of the building was a Russian, a old Russian with a big beard.</span> <span id="s625">Nobody persecuted Poles.</span> <span id="s626">The Lithuanian had a anger against Poles because of the war between them for so many years.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">But the Russian were, were kept neutral.</span> <span id="s628">Nobody -- the old ones, and not new Russians.</span> <span id="s629">They were regular Lithuanian citizens.</span> <span id="s630">When I walked in in that apartment, a rifle was hanging on the wall.</span> <span id="s631">And he explained me, "You see, I can easily take down the rifle and shoot you dead.</span> <span id="s632">But I'm not going to do it."</span> <span id="s633">He returned to me a pair of shoes and some underwear, and a loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s634">Because I was extremely well-to-do, and because my friend was a former Polish immigrant, he arranged for me to buy from Vilna the most luxury Polish furniture that only nobility could afford to have it -- or multi-millionaires.</span> <span id="s635">It was called tonnette (ph) manufacturing.</span> <span id="s636">So he became the possessor of all the luxury, with everything I had.</span> <span id="s637">And after a few days, we moved into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s638">By then, my sister's apartment where she lived was not any more designated to the ghetto, and we had to move in somewhere else.</span> <span id="s639">And since every Jew got something, so my family got also some kind of a location together with other Jews.</span> <span id="s640">But in the meantime, we were in ghetto.</span> <span id="s641">The ghetto was not completely closed up by then.</span> <span id="s642">But Jews were constantly moving in.</span> <span id="s643">The German authorities gave us, I think, until August 15th to close in the ghetto, where no more, no, no Jews would be in Kovno ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">02:21:35 It should be in Kovno.</span> <span id="s645">Free should move in in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s646">I had a dear Lithuanian friend, a Chris, a Christian Lithuanian friend -- also a former assistant of mine -- by the name of Kostas (ph).</span> <span id="s647">And while I was preparing myself, I was not prepared that Stal-- Hitler will attack Stalin and overnight we will be finished.</span> <span id="s648">We were prepared that the Russians will take over Lithuania and stay aside watching Hitler fighting with England and, and France, and nothing will happen in Lithuania.</span> <span id="s649">And since the Germans -- the Russians -- might will take over my country, I was prepared with my, with my wealth that I could live for a thousand years by having packages of my properties in different houses of different friends, Jewish and non-Jewish.</span> <span id="s650">Whoever was my friends, I supported some of those families for a couple years, in order for them to -- while they are keeping my properties.</span> <span id="s651">Because I figured out exactly and precisely, if anything should happen except the war between Hitler and Stalin, I would have enough to live for myself and for all the dozens of families who had my properties.</span> <span id="s652">When I say "myself," it's not “I” personally.</span> <span id="s653">It's the five families of my, of my sisters.</span> <span id="s654">And that could have happened.</span> <span id="s655">I left with Kostas a box of British gold pens to be put in in fountain pens.</span> <span id="s656">In that time, there was no ball-points.</span> <span id="s657">It was only -- no ball-points.</span> <span id="s658">It was only pencils and pens.</span> <span id="s659">I had a box about that big.</span> <span id="s660">In that box was a hundred boxes of a hundred pen in each box.</span> <span id="s661">If that property would have been converted successfully, at the time of the transfer from Russian might to German might to the private -- might, it would have been worth millions.</span> <span id="s662">Because nobody could have refused a gold pen to put in in their fountain pen, to continue be able to write.</span> <span id="s663">I left a whole box of that with Kostas.</span> <span id="s664">And when I came, before I got into the ghetto, to pick up from him -- I had dinner with him, and at dinner they served me with a broken fork and I left.</span> <span id="s665">I took a droskaback and a droska forth.</span> <span id="s666">If I would have been caught riding a droska, I would have been shot on the premises.</span> <span id="s667">But I did.</span> <span id="s668">I felt I had to do it, because by going in in the ghetto I thought I would be able to help myself survive for a long time with that, with that pens.</span> <span id="s669">You know what I'm talking about, that pen?</span> <span id="s670">Do you know what I'm saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: No.</span> <span id="s672">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: No, you don't.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: Like a fountain pen?</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: Like a foun-- a pen to be put in, in the fountain pen.</span> <span id="s676">Q: That's right.</span> <span id="s677">Right, I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">02:25:00</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: The most treasured thing in Lithuania or in Russia was a fountain pen.</span> <span id="s680">And the pen, the fountain pen, could not function without that pen.</span> <span id="s681">I came back to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s682">I took in with, with the, with the properties.</span> <span id="s683">And I immediately, the next day -- but immediately the next day.</span> <span id="s684">Most of the Jewish were permitted to come into the ghetto with all their properties, with the furniture.</span> <span id="s685">Some of them hired transportation -- horse and buggies -- and came into the ghetto with everything they had because the Nazis knew that everything the Jewish would bring in in the ghetto, they'll get it later.</span> <span id="s686">It was no problem.</span> <span id="s687">The Jewish were not running from them anywhere.</span> <span id="s688">But I came in with nothing, with five mouths.</span> <span id="s689">And the first meal you may manage, the second and the third.</span> <span id="s690">What you do with the fourth meal?</span> <span id="s691">So the following day, I immediately walked around the streets, where most of the people -- who had everything they needed for the first three, four weeks -- they're hiding, in order not to be captured to be taken to work.</span> <span id="s692">Because there's no guarantee that you'll come back.</span> <span id="s693">I was walking around looking to be captured, to be taken to work, because that was the only opportunity, by being at work outside the Kovno ghetto, that I may have somehow a possibility to have some kind of food to survive and to bring to my family.</span> <span id="s694">That was my motivation.</span> <span id="s695">A young member of the, of the same apartment where I lived -- there were several families in one room apartment.</span> <span id="s696">I think a young couple.</span> <span id="s697">And he followed my footsteps, and he went with me.</span> <span id="s698">After walking for 10, 15 minutes, we naturally were captured by Lithuanian guards.</span> <span id="s699">One important factor I forgot to tell you.</span> <span id="s700">Can I put it in now?</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: At a time a when Jewish were still walking back and forth from Kovno ghetto, from Kovno 23 Horse-drawn buggy.</span> <span id="s703">This could be a from a variety of languages: Russian, Polish, or German.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">to the ghetto, to, to pick up their things and to bring, I decided one day also to go to Kovno.</span> <span id="s705">Maybe I would visit Jonas Petronis, my other Christian real friend, who offered me I should help in the first place.</span> <span id="s706">And by then he had a retail book shop in Kovno.</span> <span id="s707">I thought I would visit him and take up a couple matters with him to discuss.</span> <span id="s708">There was a bridge between Kovno and Slobodka.</span> <span id="s709">And when I came near the bridge from the Slobod-- from the ghetto side, from the Slobodka side to go to Kovno, there was a Lithuanian unifor-- a Lithuanian guard with a rifle standing there.</span> <span id="s710">I didn't know who it was.</span> <span id="s711">I know him standing there, but I didn't know who it was.</span> <span id="s712">When I came closer, he captured me.</span> <span id="s713">He was the son, the Yiddish- speaking son, of the Lithuanian superintendent in the building where the family for whom I worked had purchased with the help of an American brother of the lady, a multi-millionaire, Mr. Israel Matz (ph).</span> <span id="s714">So his father was the superintendent in the building; and he was the son of the superintendent -- who spoke Yiddish as good as I, or more better.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">02:29:00 And he captured me.</span> <span id="s716">And he shouted to call the guard from the other side.</span> <span id="s717">And who was the guard on the other side?</span> <span id="s718">His older brother, who was my best friend while, while , while we were, we were on the, on the free side.</span> <span id="s719">And both of them decided in my presence, they were debating should they knock me off, throw me in the river, not knock me off.</span> <span id="s720">And both of them decided to let me go back to Kovno ghetto.</span> <span id="s721">So with that, I, I survived the first incident of destruction.</span> <span id="s722">Or, or that wasn't the first incident, but I survived that incident, too.</span> <span id="s723">The next morning, I went off with my friend to go to look for work and I was captured.</span> <span id="s724">We were taken to shant-- to the military casernes which was a tremendous distant.</span> <span id="s725">We walked.</span> <span id="s726">When we arrived there, we were half-dead.</span> <span id="s727">It was about three, four hundred people altogether.</span> <span id="s728">My friend and I was taken to a huge military barrack home.</span> <span id="s729">We were given a, a emer-- a pail -- and a brush, and we, we were taken to this to the water foun-- sink.</span> <span id="s730">And we were told to take water, and lay down and scrub the floor.</span> <span id="s731">So we did.</span> <span id="s732">We did.</span> <span id="s733">We scrubbed the floor until our knees were swollen and bloody.</span> <span id="s734">The Lithuanian, the Lithuanian murderous partisan who was in charge of us, every three or four hours came in to watch us.</span> <span id="s735">In the meantime, he murdered up -- he and his friends murdered up half of the Jewish over there because the Jewish didn't realize.</span> <span id="s736">They mistakenly believed that they are still dealing with human beings, and tried to persuade them not to have them work so hard.</span> <span id="s737">And the slightest request of resentment or opposition to the hard work, they immediately took them out and murdered them.</span> <span id="s738">I didn't have that case.</span> <span id="s739">I laid down on my knees, and I rubbed and scrubbed and rubbed and scrubbed.</span> <span id="s740">And the young man who was with me did exactly the same thing.</span> <span id="s741">That affected so much the murderous Christian Lithuanian guard that he himself run around to the Lithuanian houses and begged food from them, got food from them, came in and throw it on the floor for us to eat.</span> <span id="s742">When we were finished with that, five o'clock we were lined up and we arrived back in ghetto.</span> <span id="s743">It just so happened that the houses we got, they are the territory, the neighborhood of the poorest non-sufficient Jewish, who are worth any, nothing to the, to the Jewish administration anyhow.</span> <span id="s744">But value nothing.</span> <span id="s745">And that's where we got the houses.</span> <span id="s746">So there was a long desert to walk, a desert area, a sandy area, to walk to our quarters.</span> <span id="s747">Quiet</span></p> <p><span id="s748">24 Pail (Yiddish).</span></p> <p><span id="s749">walk.</span> <span id="s750">We were half-dead already, by the way, while we're arriving.</span> <span id="s751">When we arrived at the gate, there was already a organized a Ghettowachewho were checking the gates for the Jewish who came in.</span> <span id="s752">And there was a organized Jewish police community guards, who were guarding on the other side, on the inside of the Ghettowache.</span> <span id="s753">The cooperation between the murderous guards and the Jewish guards after a while became pretty, pretty decent, pretty tolerant after a while.</span> <span id="s754">The rule had came out already then by the chief Gestapo commander of the ghetto that every Jew who meets a German executive -- civilian or military -- has to bow and take off the hat.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">02:33:18 When we walked in the Ghettowache, we were told to be careful.</span> <span id="s756">If we will meet a German, we should bow and take off our hats if we had.</span> <span id="s757">We didn't have hats then.</span> <span id="s758">So we're walking halfway.</span> <span id="s759">We are starving.</span> <span id="s760">And a Jew was not supposed to walk on the sidewalk, so we didn't walk on the sidewalk in the first place.</span> <span id="s761">And we were walking already in the desert area when suddenly, from a corner street, two guards, two armed German military men came out walking towards us.</span> <span id="s762">When we came close enough to them, we bowed.</span> <span id="s763">And they immediately took down their rifles to shoot at us.</span> <span id="s764">And I immediately figured out what's going on, what their thought was.</span> <span id="s765">If I would turn around and run back, they would shoot us right away because they would understand that I'm running away.</span> <span id="s766">There's no way how I could run away.</span> <span id="s767">So I immediately start running backwards, for them to know that my intentions are good, and the other man followed me.</span> <span id="s768">After walking backwards 10, 15 steps and we came to their presence, we bowed very deep.</span> <span id="s769">And they laughed and walked away.</span> <span id="s770">And then, after a while, we came home and relaxed and, and had a little to eat.</span> <span id="s771">I think the guards -- the Lithuanian, whom, for whom we worked -- gave us some food to take along with us.</span> <span id="s772">And this way, every day I was going out, without waiting for anybody to line up and without waiting to be captured.</span> <span id="s773">That young man and I were walking out every morning, and we were waiting to be to be, we were looking for the opportunity to be caught and be taken outside the ghetto where, where eventually we would have had something to eat.</span> <span id="s774">The first day, I was taken to a German military unit, to the PX canteen, to wash the floors there and to help put the merchandise on the shelves.</span> <span id="s775">When we arrived there, the manager of the canteen -- the German officer, the Christian German-speaking officer in charge of the canteen -- took the two of us in the canteen room.</span> <span id="s776">The canteen room was a little like a room as, as, as big as that corner there.</span> <span id="s777">He put the pail of water in the front of the door, so when somebody would try to get in they would have to move the pail of water or, or know that it's something there.</span> <span id="s778">He was able to see who would come in.</span> <span id="s779">If it's something that he's afraid of, he would open the door right away.</span> <span id="s780">And if it was somebody not important, he would tell them that the floor is wet.</span> <span id="s781">And immediately gave us food to eat, and told us if anything will try to get in in the door and he will tell us to remove the pail, we should put the food in a corner nobody, not, not to be seen.</span> <span id="s782">And after eating, we cleaned up everything exactly and precisely, and he invited us for a few more days to come.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">25 Ghetto watch (German).</span></p> <p><span id="s784">02:36:50 And I had a beautiful, comfortable existence for my family and for other people after, for a few days.</span> <span id="s785">Then that was over.</span> <span id="s786">And I started again, and, and after three, four days being in bad areas where I had to come back with almost nothing to eat, I lined to work for the Third Police Brigade in the center of the most luxury area in, in Kovno.</span> <span id="s787">And I was working in the kitchen peeling potatoes, and, and, and doing all kind of manual work.</span> <span id="s788">And I had enough to food to, to eat, and I had enough food to bring for the family and for other people.</span> <span id="s789">By then, it must have been already mid, mid, mid, mid -- by end of August, where everything settled in.</span> <span id="s790">In the early stages, where it was still permitted to go outside of the ghetto, a great deal of Jewish young men from Slobodka ghetto -- it was easy to go to Jonava because the highway was there.</span> <span id="s791">They're running out every morning to go and get some food.</span> <span id="s792">Jordan (ph), the chief murderer of the Gestapo, was waiting for them right by the end of the trip and murdered them all.</span> <span id="s793">That was going on for three, four days, until some goyim-- decent goyim -- were able to come and to tell the Jewish not to go there, because they lined them up and they murdered them on the spot.</span> <span id="s794">I was approached several times by very good friends of mine to go with them and buy food.</span> <span id="s795">I didn't had any money or any clothing.</span> <span id="s796">Immediately thereafter the creation of the ghetto, clothing was the commodity to exchange.</span> <span id="s797">I didn't had any.</span> <span id="s798">What my superintendent returned to me was not enough for anything -- just a pair of shoes and a pair of socks, and some underwear.</span> <span id="s799">So I had no reason to go, and that's why I survived this murderous onslaught.</span> <span id="s800">When I lined up in the, in the Third Police Precinct, I think by reading the other memories I know that it was Captain Tornbaumwho was in charge.</span> <span id="s801">After three, four days working there, the, the, the chief himself, the chef himself, for whom we were actually working and giving us instructions, didn't bother with us one day or another.</span> <span id="s802">He gave us the instructions; we did them.</span> <span id="s803">He gave us to eat, and, and he had nothing to do with us one way or another.</span> <span id="s804">But one day, some more soldiers came to us, took one other man and me on a, on a, on a step on a attic in, in one of the houses, and took us over to a corner where two huge sacks of sugar was standing.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">02:40:18 He instructed us to take the sacks, to bring them to the kitchen.</span> <span id="s806">I immediately came over to the sack and started to grab it, and grabbed and grabbed and grabbed, and I couldn't even get near the sack.</span> <span id="s807">And the other guy started to argue with him.</span> <span id="s808">It's too heavy for him.</span> <span id="s809">So he told me, "Stay here."</span> <span id="s810">He walked over to him, slapped him around several times, and he grabbed the sack and run down like, like, like anything, came back with him upstairs, dragged my sack and they came down.</span> <span id="s811">Because that that, that soldier realized that I couldn't even , even, even, even wrap around the sack.</span> <span id="s812">And that was the end of the incident.</span> <span id="s813">After a while, it organized work brigades for the Jewish to go to the outside of the ghetto working.</span> <span id="s814">The best units were in the area where I was working, because there were a lot of, the complete population was filled up with Lithuanians.</span> <span id="s815">They immediately took over the luxury</span></p> <p><span id="s816">26 Gentiles (Yiddish).</span></p> <p><span id="s817">27 Captain Alfred Tornbaum apartments from the Jews.</span> <span id="s818">And they immediately started to peddle with the Jewish, bartering food for clothing.</span> <span id="s819">And the Germans there, after, after a while getting used to the way of their slaves, probably keep their eye closed or didn't bother or whatever it is.</span> <span id="s820">It was going on a, a business like a regular business.</span> <span id="s821">Clothing became a very expensive commodity to take out from Kovno ghetto.</span> <span id="s822">But the black marketeers, to them bring in food was not such a big thing.</span> <span id="s823">To them was important to buy expensive food -- like saccharine.</span> <span id="s824">You know what saccharine is?</span> <span id="s825">Sweeteners.</span> <span id="s826">Or sugar or fat or butter.</span> <span id="s827">And that, at one time or another, it was pretty comfortable to get in, bring it in.</span> <span id="s828">But after a while, it became extremely, extremely dangerous to bring in food of any value.</span> <span id="s829">And in that time, the German Nazis put up a Lithuanian Wachmeisterwho was a tall, slim person.</span> <span id="s830">By five o'clock in the afternoon, the street to enter Kovno ghetto was lined up with thirty-five thousand Jews -- everyone broken down by their brigades, lined up five in a row to march in to the ghetto after a day's work.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">That Wachmeister was purposely hired to catch the black marketeers.</span> <span id="s832">I had a contract in the work brigade, in that time, with a strong Jewish, physically strong Jew by the name of Chaimke Lipman (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s833">02:43:43 He was extremely strong, powerful man.</span> <span id="s834">I was buying a sack of potatoes, because a sack of potatoes was a tool for me to bring in in Kovno ghetto.</span> <span id="s835">And at the entrance , by then a lot of people who were brought in some food were already starving.</span> <span id="s836">So by then it was already seven, eight months, or five, six months in the existence of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s837">And things changed dramatically.</span> <span id="s838">And the el-- the elderly people who couldn't go out to work were giving their clothes to the black marketeers to bring, to bring in food for them they to have something to eat.</span> <span id="s839">And that Wachmeister had a certain morality in his own frame of mind.</span> <span id="s840">If you come in even with a big sack of potatoes, it had no monetary value at all.</span> <span id="s841">He didn't bother you.</span> <span id="s842">If you had the biggest loaf of bread on you, he didn't bother you.</span> <span id="s843">If you had barley or any other, or any other of the vegetables, or cucumbers, or any other of those fruits or vegetables, it had no value.</span> <span id="s844">He didn't bother you.</span> <span id="s845">But he was looking for sugar, butter, saccharine and other, and chocolate, and for schnapps -- any other expensive things.</span> <span id="s846">So I had a contract with Chaimke Lipschitz (ph).</span> <span id="s847">I was buying a big sack of potatoes.</span> <span id="s848">I couldn't even move the sack from the, from the, from the spot where I bought it.</span> <span id="s849">Chaimke, it was after the line-up to go to work, Chaimke was picking up my sack of potatoes, carried all the five, six miles, carried in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s850">I had my niece waiting with a little buggy, with a little dolly -- and dropped it in the dolly.</span> <span id="s851">I didn't have much farth-- very far to go with this sack of potatoes because on both sides of the ghetto, inside of the ghetto and after the gate, after Jewish walked in there were two lines of Jewish stretched out with their hands to beg.</span> <span id="s852">Among them was the famous writer, Joseph Garr (ph).</span> <span id="s853">Within seconds, half of my sack of potatoes was emptied out.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">Because it was my human duty to give it to them.</span> <span id="s855">And the rest of it was easy to haul with a little more simply, with a little wagon, to my house.</span> <span id="s856">And there my neighbors got, and my family got.</span> <span id="s857">I, on the other hand, was carrying a little box of a thousand boxes of saccharine.</span> <span id="s858">And there was five hundred saccharine in each box.</span> <span id="s859">That product, brought in in ghetto, was</span></p> <p><span id="s860">28 Watchmaster (German).</span></p> <p><span id="s861">converted to millions, probably, in that time.</span> <span id="s862">You could have gotten twenty-five suits.</span> <span id="s863">You could have gotten gold and diamonds, all for that little box.</span> <span id="s864">So I was carried this -- the box was not as long as these, as light as this, but only that thin.</span> <span id="s865">So I was carrying under my arm, and dancing like a prima donna with that little box.</span> <span id="s866">Except one thing.</span> <span id="s867">You do realize that if I were caught with that little box getting in the gate, I would have been brutally beaten up and shot right there on the premises.</span> <span id="s868">And Chaimke Lipman (ph) would have had no punishment at all for bringing in my sack of potatoes, because they saw his sack of potatoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: What happened,</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: I think I would like to rest for a few minutes.</span> <span id="s871">Can we?</span> <span id="s872">Q: Sure.</span> <span id="s873">We can take a break.</span> <span id="s874">Help yourself to some water.</span> <span id="s875">02:48:00 End of Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s877">03:00:20</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: Ok, we're back on.</span> <span id="s879">We're being taped again.</span> <span id="s880">We were, we were with when you're coming back into the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: One morning, I went out again to be, to be wait, to look for the opportunity to be captured and taken to units outside the ghetto that I would be able to bring in some food.</span> <span id="s882">I was captured soon enough.</span> <span id="s883">I was taken inside the ghetto to the new ghetto Kommandantur, where there were a group of barracks -- seven, eight single-story houses.</span> <span id="s884">And it happened to be isolated away from the residents of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s885">The only next building closest was the Jewish police precinct.</span> <span id="s886">I was taken to the Kommandantur.</span> <span id="s887">A Jewish woman by the name of Luba, who was working there already, took me to the barn, pointed her finger to a big shovel and a broom and an axe and a saw to saw woods, and told me to clean the yard.</span> <span id="s888">Then told me to clean the toilets.</span> <span id="s889">When I was finished with that, I was sawing the woods, and when I was finished with sawing the woods, I was chopping the woods.</span> <span id="s890">Luba was the maid for the Commandant.</span> <span id="s891">The new Commandant was by the name of Ritter.</span> <span id="s892">He was there every second morning.</span> <span id="s893">He arrived every second morning, one o'clock in the afternoon, stayed there for, for the next, one afternoon, one o'clock in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s894">Stayed there until the next and the following afternoon, for two afternoons.</span> <span id="s895">And one o'clock arrived, his former, his friend Tschich, who was on duty as Commandant -- both of them, they're former police officers in Vienna.</span> <span id="s896">And while I worked the first day and cleaned the toilets and cleaned out everything - - the street, the, the, the, the yard.</span> <span id="s897">I realized that thanks to Luba and Esther, the two main maids of the Kommandantur, I will have the opportunity if nothing else will happen to feed my family and several other families.</span> <span id="s898">Because this is the outlet that I have the opportunity to get food.</span> <span id="s899">After a while, I trained myself to be so fast with all the other work that I was through by half day; and the rest of the half day, I was polishing the boots and the belt buckles and the belts of the soldiers.</span> <span id="s900">The Ghettowache contained of about seven, eight individual story combined barracks with two rooms with one entrance.</span> <span id="s901">And all entrances was on one side.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">03:03:49 On the other side was the living room, with a window in the living room but no door to get in.</span> <span id="s903">After a short period of time, under Luba's and Esther's influence, the Commandant instructed me to bring in all the confis-- almost all the confiscated food that was taken away from the Jewish in the evening when they came in from the work on the outside brigade, working brigades.</span> <span id="s904">And it was all lined up in my hands to take care of and being in charge of separating, to bring in almost all the food in the bedroom of the Commandant Ritter.</span> <span id="s905">The Jewish police precinct was only a short distance away.</span> <span id="s906">The Chief of Third Jewish Police Precinct was a certain Kamse (ph), or Tarsis (ph) -- I don't remember.</span> <span id="s907">A former good friend of mine from the wars, from the days before the war.</span> <span id="s908">I had made arrangements with him.</span> <span id="s909">He was sending twenty to twenty-four policemen, lined up behind the window of the, of the bedroom of the Commandant.</span> <span id="s910">I was opening the window, putting up the window or opening it, and hand over the first package to the first policeman who was standing behind the window.</span> <span id="s911">He turned and gave it to the next, until it land up in the precinct.</span> <span id="s912">And there, the Commandant was calling in, the Chief of Police called in the victims from whom the merchandise was taken away and returned to them.</span> <span id="s913">After a while, Commandant Ritter instructed me to go to the Chief of Police and tell him that the Jewish who are coming in from the outside brigade should sew in initials on their bags, on their shopping bags, which was confiscated.</span> <span id="s914">So they should be able to get in return their own properties.</span> <span id="s915">All, all the Gestapo used to come and pick up some food for themselves from, from Kovno.</span> <span id="s916">They were coming in a small black Volkswagen.</span> <span id="s917">Luba is the one who prepared everything for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">Also, the food for the Ghettowache -- primarily, the Commandant -- was cooked with the confiscated food.</span> <span id="s919">After a while -- but, but after a while, what's going on was while I was returning the food to the Jews, the Lithuanian Ghettowache started to mumble that they don't have enough food.</span> <span id="s920">And where would they have enough food?</span> <span id="s921">Because some of the food was returned to the victims, and it wasn't enough to cook for them, so they had to bring in foods for themselves.</span> <span id="s922">The Wache was hanging on, the Lithuanian and the German Ghettowache was hanging on the premises because the duty around the fences was only for two hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">03:07:15 After the two hours, they were free for four hours.</span> <span id="s924">They couldn't possibly go home and then come back in the four hours, or three hours, or two and two -- I just don't remember exactly.</span> <span id="s925">It was not enough time for them to go home and then come back on duty.</span> <span id="s926">So they were laying around in the outer barracks recuperating and resting and sewing their stockings, and do any of the other things there necessary while they were waiting to go back on duty.</span> <span id="s927">In order to prevent any of the guards -- the Jewish or the German -- or any outside German who would come into the ghetto to catch what I'm doing.</span> <span id="s928">Because if it would have been discovered what I'm doing, I would have been the second to be shot.</span> <span id="s929">Commandant Ritter would have been the first to be shot.</span> <span id="s930">For the period of the time when I was bringing in the food in his bedroom from the, from the barns opposite, he lined them all up in front on the garden, on the lawn up front, and personally conducted with all of them physical exer- exercise.</span> <span id="s931">Up and down, and down and up, and up and down, and down and up.</span> <span id="s932">Some of them were getting so exhausted that they couldn't move every time.</span> <span id="s933">And the only time when I walked around with my big broom and shovel twice around the yard, that was the signal to him that it's all over, and he released them.</span> <span id="s934">That was going on for two days.</span> <span id="s935">After that Tschich came, and he was for two days.</span> <span id="s936">Although Tschich, Commandant Tschich, never harmed me at all -- he was rather decent to me -- but he told me from the first day that if he, if he will ever catch me returning anything to the, of the confiscated food to the Jews, he will shot me right there and then.</span> <span id="s937">And I followed his rule.</span> <span id="s938">He never caught me returning anything and everything.</span> <span id="s939">When I was finished with the actual duty of helping in the kitchen and peeling potatoes and cleaning the latrines, I was shining the buckles and the boots.</span> <span id="s940">You can be assured that the most beautiful polished boots in the whole world was Commandant Ritter's.</span> <span id="s941">And his buckle -- so was his buckle.</span> <span id="s942">I had invented a special invention.</span> <span id="s943">I took a glass, a empty glass.</span> <span id="s944">And with the back side of the glass I rubbed in the polish on the boot and the buckle, let it dry out for awhile.</span> <span id="s945">And then, when the, with the, with the, with bottom side of the glass I circular rubbed all away.</span> <span id="s946">And I'm not sure that if anybody in the world would have had such a beautiful shoes.</span> <span id="s947">After a while -- I think it was about four or five months -- and Ritter and Tschich, the whole unit -- the whole unit moved away.</span> <span id="s948">And a new unit came in.</span> <span id="s949">And the commandant of that new unit was a German by the name of Schultz.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">03:11:12 He did not instruct me to repeat the same things what I did with Commander Ritter, except he instructed me something else.</span> <span id="s951">At that time, the Gestapo permitted to form a Volksküche -- a kitchen to give the starving Jews, those that were starving, to give soup during the day free of charge.</span> <span id="s952">And that volksküche needed food to cook.</span> <span id="s953">And there was a former Hebrew teacher, I think by the name of Schulgasser (ph), who would come, who was coming with a horse and buggy.</span> <span id="s954">And he fill down, the horse, I fill down for him the horse and buggy with the food, and they took away.</span> <span id="s955">After a short period of time, I am sure that there was -- again, under the influence of Luba and Esther -- he, he instructed me to go to the Chief of the Third Precinct, Police Precinct, Mr. Tomason (ph), and tell him he should arrange that Schulgasser should have a second horse and buggy similar to the first horse.</span> <span id="s956">If the first horse was a white horse, so the second one should be a white horse.</span> <span id="s957">And stay a distant away.</span> <span id="s958">And when he was filled up with the first one and the first one came out from the territory of the Ghettowache territory, to bring in the second one and filling in the second one.</span> <span id="s959">Schultz, at the time when it became already very, very difficult, and at a time when it was known that Obersturmbannführer Goeckeis coming to liquidate the Kovno ghetto -- and Goecke was known by all Jews that he was the liquidator.</span> <span id="s960">He started from the furthest part in Russia, and when the German armies were stepping back toward Germany, he was liquidating ghetto after ghetto after ghetto.</span> <span id="s961">At the time it was known that Goecke is coming with units of liquidating the Kovno ghetto, I was helping sew a rucksack for the Commandant Schultz to put in Luba's blonde four, five years old boy and carry him over through the gates at night with the flashlight of the signals.</span> <span id="s962">They had flashlights with three different colors, that there was a signal, a specia-- a separate signal that the commandant is going, to better to go climb through the ghetto and take the baby in the village, where one of the Lithuanian guards -- they are by then already in the beginning of '44, 1944, even some of the worst murde-- Lithuanian murderers became already friendly with Jews because they were looking already for a ticket.</span> <span id="s963">So one of the Lithuanians offered to survive and Luba's son, and the Commandant Schultz carried over personally the son to the Lithuanian's house.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">03:15:10 After a short period of time, the Ghettowache disappeared, and a new Ghettowache arrived.</span> <span id="s965">And they didn't have anymore the quarters in Kovno ghetto.</span> <span id="s966">They had the quarters already in 29 Common kitchen (German).</span></p> <p><span id="s967">30 Lieutenant Colonel (German); Wilhelm Goecke a school, in a former school outside the Kovno ghetto which is about 15, 20 minutes by, by car away from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s968">There I was again called in to be the slave of the, of the Ghettowache kitchen.</span> <span id="s969">It was the unit of Obersturmbannführer Goethe -- Goecke.</span> <span id="s970">It was the unit of the Obersturmbannführer Goecke, who arrived for the process of liquidating the Kovno ghetto.</span> <span id="s971">He immediately converted the Kovno ghetto to a Kon, to a KonzentrationslagerKaunas.</span> <span id="s972">And the restrictions became extremely severe for the Jews in every level.</span> <span id="s973">I and all the other slaves for the Ghettowache were immediately taken away from the ghetto, and they built special bungalows, special quarters, upstairs of this of this school for us to be there and to stay there and not to go back to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s974">By then it was a big kitchen with maybe several hundred SS guards, and it required more people to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">And quite a few Jews managed to get themselves in the brigade.</span> <span id="s976">And while they were there, they were locked in together with me, and they became permanent laborers, slave laborers, for the Ghettowache.</span> <span id="s977">The, the chef of the kitchen was Ober, or Unter, or Oberscharführer Blaufuchs.</span> <span id="s978">He was a, a, a, a, they had -- he was not the chef.</span> <span id="s979">He was the head of the kitchen.</span> <span id="s980">The chef was somebody else.</span> <span id="s981">And he was the direct boss of Luba and Esther, and direct my boss.</span> <span id="s982">I continued with the same duties of cleaning the toilets, cleaning the rooms, peeling potatoes, peeling beans for the kitchen, and all other manual labor work.</span> <span id="s983">In addition to that, Wagner was one of the, of the PX managers.</span> <span id="s984">And he had a bicycle, and he constantly instructed me to clean his bicycles.</span> <span id="s985">The physical appearance of the location was as following: a small walking gate was from the main street.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">03:18:38 Well, about 15 blocks further was the Ghettowache, the ghetto.</span> <span id="s987">And it was the low, lower gate in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s988">The ghetto had two entrances.</span> <span id="s989">By then, they built a second entrance which was closer to the school where the Ghettowache was located.</span> <span id="s990">And there, there was a constant guard standing with a rifle on the sidewalk of the, of the walking entrance.</span> <span id="s991">And any time Goecke was about to arrive about one o'clock in the afternoon, that guard was giving signals that Goecke is arriving.</span> <span id="s992">And with those signals, even high ranking officers of the SS attempted, if they could, to shy away from the premises, because nobody wanted to stumble into Goecke.</span> <span id="s993">The only person who had a strong influence on him in a relationship to the, to the, to the dining room was Unter-- Oberscharführer Blaufuchs, the head of the kitchen, because he was putting food in his stomach.</span> <span id="s994">I, by habit, didn't want to get rich.</span> <span id="s995">I couldn't get anymore to my family at all.</span> <span id="s996">I couldn't do anything.</span> <span id="s997">I didn't want to go out and, and, and do business on the black market.</span> <span id="s998">As several Jews, from time to time -- arranged by the admin-- Jewish Judenrat-- they're coming to the Wache to, to beg and to buy themselves food.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">Because every outside work brigade had the opportunity to buy food, except the airport.</span> <span id="s1000">And a lot of people who worked on the airport get passes to go to the other work brigades, in order to be able to get themselves food; because the airport slave labor was the real slave labor.</span> <span id="s1001">And the whole existence of the ghetto depended on the airports.</span> <span id="s1002">If the general in 31 Concentration camp (German).</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">32 Sergeant (German).</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">33 Jewish Council (German).</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">charge of the airports would decided to liquidate the airports brigade, probably the ghetto would have been liquidated immediately.</span> <span id="s1006">So it was very important for the Judenrat to have the, the, the Flug-- the Flüghafenfunctioning.</span> <span id="s1007">One time somebody asked me to buy medicine for a child.</span> <span id="s1008">I just don't remember what it was.</span> <span id="s1009">And I walked out outside of the gates, outside of the premises, in the next gentile house, Christian house, where everybody was communicating there constantly except I. I never did, but to do somebody a very important favor, I did walk out.</span> <span id="s1010">The premises of the, of the, of the, of the school was that on the front on the main street was the walking entrance, but on the side street was the driving entrance.</span> <span id="s1011">And the gate was constantly open to driving entrance, because there was a danger the Goecke may drive in any time.</span> <span id="s1012">And how would it be that gate is closed, and he had to beep, blow the horn to be let in?</span> <span id="s1013">So it was constantly open.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">03:22:15 I walked out to that house next to, close enough to the Ghettowache, and discussed with the farmer, with the gentile family about the question I was, I came to ask.</span> <span id="s1015">And I, I was about ready to go back, and two Lithuanian policemen arrived.</span> <span id="s1016">And one of them sat down to write the protocol to take me to the Gestapo where I would have been immediately shot because they got a bonus for bringing me there.</span> <span id="s1017">And the other was walking around from door, from the door to the middle of the room, while the first one was writing the protocol.</span> <span id="s1018">I was standing as shivering like, like, like, like hell for a few seconds, and then it dawned on me, "What am I shivering?"</span> <span id="s1019">I looked around, and I saw that the door was a push-out from the outside.</span> <span id="s1020">I waited on the next turn when the guard, the policeman, was coming closer to the inside.</span> <span id="s1021">And I run to the door.</span> <span id="s1022">I pushed with my foot.</span> <span id="s1023">I start running.</span> <span id="s1024">They shoot at me, but they didn't got me.</span> <span id="s1025">And I was immediately, through the open wide gate, in on the premises, I immediately came to Luba.</span> <span id="s1026">She immediately informed Oberscharführer Blaufuchs and he within seconds took me, put me upstairs, put a guard over there.</span> <span id="s1027">And a few minutes later, the two Lithuanian came to look for me, and he chased them out.</span> <span id="s1028">His chasing them out was it was only a momentary victory, a moment, a momen-- a momentarily victory.</span> <span id="s1029">The higher powers over him were of the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s1030">And those two Lithuanian policeman were, were the employees of the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s1031">It was their business to capture the Jewish on the outside so they could have reported to the Gestapo and get, and Gestapo could have come and find me there.</span> <span id="s1032">And Obersturmbann-- Ober, Oberscharführer Blaufuchs could not have helped a bit in that case.</span> <span id="s1033">But within seconds, he lined up a closed truck, got two guards shipped out with me inside, took me to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1034">And in the ghetto, where will they find me?</span> <span id="s1035">The next day, I came back to work.</span> <span id="s1036">At one time I was called in, in, in, in, in Blaufuchs's apartment to clean his apartment, because his wife was coming to visit him.</span> <span id="s1037">And while I was cleaning the floor and everything else, she arrived.</span> <span id="s1038">And when she arrived, he hardly kissed her and introduced her to me and said, "David, du kannst ausstrecken deine Hand zu meiner Frau.</span> <span id="s1039">"I can shake hands with his Frau.</span> <span id="s1040">And I shook hands with her.</span> <span id="s1041">My job was finished then, and, and, and I disappeared.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">34 Airport (German).</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">35 "David, you can shake hands with my wife."</span> <span id="s1044">(German)</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">03:25:30 The, the, the liquidation of the Kovno ghetto got closer and closer and closer by the day.</span> <span id="s1046">It was going on by the day.</span> <span id="s1047">It took probably about five, six months from the time Goecke arrived until he started to liquidate.</span> <span id="s1048">All that depended on the front.</span> <span id="s1049">If the front got closer, then he liquidated faster.</span> <span id="s1050">In the meantime, he started to organize the Konzentrationslager Kovno.</span> <span id="s1051">In the meantime, he had the Kinderand the woman and the old people liquidation, where all the children and all the old people were in one day lined up and taken to be destroyed.</span> <span id="s1052">In that action, my little seven years old nephew and my almost 75 years old mother was taken out.</span> <span id="s1053">They told me afterwards.</span> <span id="s1054">It's a German Wachmeister, one of the units.</span> <span id="s1055">When he came back, cried when he told me in torturous murder, how they destroyed the people, the old people.</span> <span id="s1056">Mothers, mothers, mothers, mothers were, were, were, were falling, kneeling for them, kissing their feet, not to take their child.</span> <span id="s1057">So they killed the mother with the child.</span> <span id="s1058">They were taking children.</span> <span id="s1059">The main action of liquidating, it was in the front of the three big brick buildings.</span> <span id="s1060">They were taking children, the, the, the Ukrainian and Lithuanian murderers were going up to the third floor.</span> <span id="s1061">It was a three story building.</span> <span id="s1062">They were finding children on the top floor, and dropping them down through the window to the Ukrainian or Lithuanian guard who was standing downstairs on the street.</span> <span id="s1063">And he picked them up and knocked his head on the wall, choking up, until the child was dead.</span> <span id="s1064">The German Wachmeister who told me the brutality told me how a woman was find, a elderly woman was find in a toilet.</span> <span id="s1065">The toilets were wooden house, wooden bungalows-like.</span> <span id="s1066">And she was hiding, and it was almost all over.</span> <span id="s1067">And she mistakenly stuck out her head to see if it is all over and the Gestapo man saw her.</span> <span id="s1068">They were walking with big sticks exactly for that purpose, with wide, with wide handles.</span> <span id="s1069">My stick doesn't have a wide handle, but their stick had special wide curves in order to grab a, a person's neck and pull them like that.</span> <span id="s1070">So the Wachmeister cried for me, in telling me how brutally elderly woman was dragged with the stick on the sidewalk until she was dead before she was thrown in the truck.</span> <span id="s1071">When I came back after, when they started to liquidate the ghetto and brought me back in the ghetto, my sister told me that that old lady was my mother.</span> <span id="s1072">That's the way she was, she was taken out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">03:29:30 At the start of the liquidation of Kovno ghetto, the last few days Goecke, personally, and, and, and Berman (ph) or Breller (ph), his assistant -- I don't really remember him.</span> <span id="s1074">In the book their whole names, but it's not important for us.</span> <span id="s1075">They, personally, they're driving around the areas where groups of young people they're trying to escape.</span> <span id="s1076">Everybody knew it's the end.</span> <span id="s1077">And they caught them and shot them on the streets, on the field -- wherever they caught them -- without any mercy.</span> <span id="s1078">Immediately, they murdered them.</span> <span id="s1079">I was brought in in Kovno ghetto, back in KZ Kovno, back to be prepared for the liquidation.</span> <span id="s1080">But then they sent in a new group of guards, and that new group of guards needed service.</span> <span id="s1081">They needed to prepare straw, straw mattresses for them.</span> <span id="s1082">And I was called in with the other former workers</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">36 Children (German).</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">to prepare the sacks for them.</span> <span id="s1085">In those days they were building -- there was a barn where the wood was located, and all the tools.</span> <span id="s1086">It was old rotten wood.</span> <span id="s1087">They were building new barracks up to the last minute to prevent the Jewish to go through the, to cut through, dig out and, and -- because the wood was all then rotten, to, to break it out and go, and go through.</span> <span id="s1088">So I, I, I, I, with the five, six other Jewish workers there, practically the last couple days before the liquidation of our camp, attempted to do that.</span> <span id="s1089">We attempted to dig out in the side that was still rotten.</span> <span id="s1090">You pull it out from under the earth.</span> <span id="s1091">You dug out the earth.</span> <span id="s1092">And there was a religious Jew by the name of Portnoy (ph).</span> <span id="s1093">He had already his family outside, and he had prepared his place for himself outside.</span> <span id="s1094">And when he noticed that, he came to the kitchen and informed on us.</span> <span id="s1095">So you should see this scene, how the cook, and the assistant cook, and Wagner and, and, and, and Blaufuchs all came out to help us dig back in, so those who would see and kill us immediately they should not be able to see anything that were not smooth.</span> <span id="s1096">It was not smooth.</span> <span id="s1097">There was a guard, Schmittus (ph).</span> <span id="s1098">One of the guards was a man by the name of Schmittus.</span> <span id="s1099">I was told that he was a Ger—a, a, a, Ger, a Volksdeutschein Budapest.</span> <span id="s1100">You know what a Volksdeutsche, Volksdeutsche is?</span> <span id="s1101">And the Nazis recognized Volksdeutsche as Deutsche</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">03:32:55 Some of the Volksdeutsche were the worst murderers, and some of them were decent people -- like all people are bad and good, except the good were in a very small minority.</span> <span id="s1103">Probably amongst 10 thousands, you could have find one or two decent people.</span> <span id="s1104">Schmittus tried, made so many efforts to help me.</span> <span id="s1105">Schmittus was constantly arguing with Blaufuchs against the treatment of, the bad treatment of the Jews.</span> <span id="s1106">But he was arguing with the wrong person, because Blaufuchs didn't have any better, any other opinion than he had.</span> <span id="s1107">The day before we were liqui-- before we were taken back to Kovno ghetto, and few days before the total liquidation, I was doing my work and Wagner called me over.</span> <span id="s1108">His bicycle was standing in the front of the entrance to the kitchen.</span> <span id="s1109">The entrance of the kitchen was here, and the open gates to drive in was here.</span> <span id="s1110">And Goecke, when he was driving in, was driving in to, to the other wall, turn around, faced his car to get out, and walked to the kitchen.</span> <span id="s1111">So Wagner told me to clean his bicycle suddenly.</span> <span id="s1112">It was the hour in the day when nobody would expect Goecke to come to the dining room.</span> <span id="s1113">He had his own headquarters in, in the ghetto, and he had his own headquarters in the Gestapo headquarters.</span> <span id="s1114">He used to come to that, to the guard unit only for dinner, for, for lunch.</span> <span id="s1115">And it was about 11 o'clock in the morning, or 11:30, when nobody would ever suspect or dream that he would come.</span> <span id="s1116">The guard who was constantly stationed on the, on the front of the main street with the sidewalk entrance was a, a, a, a -- also a Volksdeutsche.</span> <span id="s1117">A little confused human being, you know, but a very decent person.</span> <span id="s1118">We taught him that when you see danger -- Goecke, or Gestapo, or any other officer -- he should knock on the sidewalk with the rifle and shout twice, "Yaveh (ph) v'yavo."</span> <span id="s1119">37 Ethnic German (German).</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">38 German (German).</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">39 This phrase (actually pronounced “Ya-aleh” v’yavo in Hebrew), meaning “He’s arising and coming,” comes originally from part of a Hebrew prayer.</span> <span id="s1122">In the ghetto, “ya-aleh” That's the Hebrew words: "He comes, he's here."</span> <span id="s1123">03:35:40 And when he shout, he couldn't pronounce both words, but "Yahveh" he remember very well.</span> <span id="s1124">But when he shouted, "Yahveh!"</span> <span id="s1125">everything disappeared from the, from the front area.</span> <span id="s1126">That day he wasn't there.</span> <span id="s1127">Somebody else -- a stranger who was not under our influence.</span> <span id="s1128">And Wagner told me to clean his bicycle.</span> <span id="s1129">And I removed my beautiful blue jacket with the stars of David on the front and the back in order not to make dirty, and I took the bicycle.</span> <span id="s1130">I was walking with the bicycle from the area where Wagner gave it to me towards the, towards the barn, where I had my tools.</span> <span id="s1131">And I passed by the area of the open gate and in drives in Goecke with a lady.</span> <span id="s1132">Turns around.</span> <span id="s1133">Gets out of the car.</span> <span id="s1134">Walks over to me.</span> <span id="s1135">Pulls out a gun.</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">And he was ready to shoot.</span> <span id="s1137">And I, and I stood up like a military person.</span> <span id="s1138">I clicked my feet.</span> <span id="s1139">I was wearing galoshes.</span> <span id="s1140">In July, I was wearing galoshes.</span> <span id="s1141">But I made movement like I'm clicking my feet, and I shouted loud and clear, "Obersturmbannführer Goecke!</span> <span id="s1142">Das ist nicht mein Schuld -- mein Schuld, dass ich keine Star of David habe.</span> <span id="s1143">Der Wagner verlangte ich soll sein Fahrrad saubermachen, (and) um nicht zu verschmutzen die Jacke mit die gelbe Stern … hab ich runtergenommen und ich ging mit dem Fahrrad zu der Bahn um meine Gezeig zu nehmen.</span> <span id="s1144">"In that moment, he lowered down the revolver.</span> <span id="s1145">And within, in, in that moment, Blaufuchs was already near him.</span> <span id="s1146">That's the only person whom he'll listen to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">Wagner was on the other side, and other high ranking SS officers.</span> <span id="s1148">There was a new man who came a few days ago -- a huge person, a SS officer.</span> <span id="s1149">He probably was the head of the transportation.</span> <span id="s1150">And he saw what's going on, and everybody testified on my behalf, that I was not attempting to escape with the bicycle.</span> <span id="s1151">I was just going to the other area to clean it.</span> <span id="s1152">It, it took minutes, and Goecke gave a shout to me, "Verschwinden!"</span> <span id="s1153">And I immediately "verschwind.”</span> <span id="s1154">You know what “verschwind” is -- disappear.</span> <span id="s1155">And I disappeared.</span> <span id="s1156">He went to have lunch.</span> <span id="s1157">He walked out from his lunch.</span> <span id="s1158">Blaufuchs was right behind him.</span> <span id="s1159">And he shouted, "Wo ist die Jude mit die blaue Jacke?!</span> <span id="s1160">"And I immediately was there standing, like, like, like "Attention!"</span> <span id="s1161">And he delivered this small speech to me, and he explained that the "Blaue Jacke ist beschlagnahmt.</span> <span id="s1162">"It's confiscated.</span> <span id="s1163">And again shouted to me, "Andreten!</span> <span id="s1164">"And I walked away, and he drove away.</span> <span id="s1165">And the same day, we were taken back to the ghetto and it started the liquidation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">03:39:00 meant “bigshot” and was used by ghetto inhabitants to announce warnings; for example, an approaching German guard.</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">40 "Lieutenant Colonel Goecke, it is not my fault, my fault that I have no Star of David.</span> <span id="s1168">Mr. Wagner demanded that I clean his bicycle, and so as not to stain the jacket with the yellow star … I have taken it off and I went to the rail with my stuff.”</span> <span id="s1169">(German) 41 “Where is the Jew with the blue jacket?”</span> <span id="s1170">(German) 42 “Blue jacket is confiscated.”</span> <span id="s1171">(German)</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">43 Attention (German) I arrived Saturday night back in Kovno, never to go back to the, to the Ghettowache.</span> <span id="s1173">I slept over the night.</span> <span id="s1174">I, I had my niece then.</span> <span id="s1175">My mother and the baby, Alenke was already murdered.</span> <span id="s1176">By the way, people told me when I arrived in the ghetto that that was the day when Goecke murdered, caught and murdered four or five group of young people -- a total of six, seven people per group.</span> <span id="s1177">About thirty, forty people were murdered that day.</span> <span id="s1178">And that's when they permitted me to be saved from Goecke, in a situation like that.</span> <span id="s1179">Couldn't happen in a million years anything like that.</span> <span id="s1180">And Sunday morning the Wache started already to catch us and to put us in a cage.</span> <span id="s1181">Shortly before I left the Kovno ghetto, two or three weeks before, to to and never came to come back to work for the Ghettowache, I noticed that Jewish were building near the Kaisergasse (ph), a gate – a, a, a fence, a fenced a, a, a wire fence, a wire bu-- a wire partition like -- four or five times as big as this here, on the field in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">And somehow I thought maybe, maybe, maybe that will be to, to drive in Jews before the liquidation.</span> <span id="s1183">Anyhow, Sunday morning the liquidation started, and I was caught by one of the new guards.</span> <span id="s1184">And -- no, I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s1185">I was -- I begged my sister to go with me whatever will be happened, and my niece to go with me.</span> <span id="s1186">But she got permission to go in a bunker which one of the most prominent Jewish people build.</span> <span id="s1187">She was a friend of the man's wife, and they permitted her to stay until.</span> <span id="s1188">And we figured it's only for three or four days, and in three or four days Russians were coming.</span> <span id="s1189">And they permitted my niece, after a while, to going in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">And while I was running to look for directions they had -- Mongrel (ph) was his name -- came out from the bunker and invited me, too.</span> <span id="s1191">I am a, I am a breathing difficulty.</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">03:42:00 I was then, and I am today.</span> <span id="s1193">So after being there for a couple of seconds, the bunker was built for maybe 12, 14 people.</span> <span id="s1194">By when I came in -- the last one, I and my niece there was already -- I was already the 67th or the 68th.</span> <span id="s1195">It was burning hot in July.</span> <span id="s1196">It was the first week in July, so how long could I have stayed in that place?</span> <span id="s1197">After a few seconds, I started to cough and I got out.</span> <span id="s1198">I forced Dinah, my niece, also to get out.</span> <span id="s1199">Somehow, she listened to me.</span> <span id="s1200">And we were captured right away on the street, and put in the enclosed wire fence that was fenced.</span> <span id="s1201">We were one of the few in the beginning, but as the day progressed, it became thousands of them.</span> <span id="s1202">People were stepping on each other already.</span> <span id="s1203">We were laying there for three days and three nights.</span> <span id="s1204">On the second day, the transportation of the Kovno ghetto took place in three groups.</span> <span id="s1205">The first group went out Sunday afternoon without any incident.</span> <span id="s1206">They went out, and they were taken to Germany.</span> <span id="s1207">The second group was my transportation.</span> <span id="s1208">But the Jewish that they find on the street, they lined them up and safely under the fence.</span> <span id="s1209">But they were going with Jewish men, Jewish policemen, from building, house to house, fish out the people in the hiding places.</span> <span id="s1210">And there, the woman were laying nude just in a garden, and the men were practically nude, and brought them all to the to the encampment.</span> <span id="s1211">So from an area that it could house maximum a hundred or 200 people, there were already two-- 3000 people concentrated.</span> <span id="s1212">And it became a tremendous situation.</span> <span id="s1213">You had to do your bowel movements right there and then on the premises because you couldn't go anywhere.</span> <span id="s1214">And the stink from the smell from the bowels was not to be believed.</span> <span id="s1215">I think we were laying there for three, four days or more, because they couldn't get transportation for us to go to the ghetto, to go to the, to the train.</span> <span id="s1216">Anyhow, in those days, Schmittus was crawling from body -- person to person over the people to look for "the David."</span> <span id="s1217">I am "the David."</span> <span id="s1218">I am David.</span> <span id="s1219">And when he find, “Who would know is ‘the David’?”</span> <span id="s1220">Only the few Jews who worked with me knew that they called “the David.”</span> <span id="s1221">There must have been fifty Davids there.</span> <span id="s1222">Who would know?</span> <span id="s1223">He finally find me.</span> <span id="s1224">And when he find me, he told me that I, when, to-- tonight or the next night, they wake us all up to march out.</span> <span id="s1225">And at that time, I should try to be the very last line, and I instructed my niece to be the very one with me.</span> <span id="s1226">And other people who were near me, I instructed them the same way.</span> <span id="s1227">He said, by being the very last line, he and Wagner and two other additional people will close up the line of guards.</span> <span id="s1228">They will be the last guards.</span> <span id="s1229">And as soon as they get out from the ghetto, I should escape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">03:45:49 He said naturally I should not get concerned that all four of them will, will kneel and shoot at me.</span> <span id="s1231">But they wouldn't shoot at me.</span> <span id="s1232">I should keep running.</span> <span id="s1233">I instructed my sister, my niece to do that, too.</span> <span id="s1234">I was ready to two eventualities.</span> <span id="s1235">I wanted to escape anyhow.</span> <span id="s1236">I was ready, I hoped for two things may happen while I'm escaping.</span> <span id="s1237">Maybe I'll escape and be an escapee; or while escaping I'll be shot in the rear.</span> <span id="s1238">Without pain, I'll be dead.</span> <span id="s1239">I happened to walk out Sunday morning in a clean, bright shirt.</span> <span id="s1240">And while laying the few days in the field, I find the brother of my brother-in-law, who happened to have had a brown shirt, a dark shirt.</span> <span id="s1241">And I exchanged with him.</span> <span id="s1242">I gave him my shirt, and he gave me his shirt.</span> <span id="s1243">I, I, I had a silly logic that if I'll have to run in the middle of the night, the guards may see my white shirt and shoot me.</span> <span id="s1244">The brown shirt, they will not see, because I planned to run out.</span> <span id="s1245">I had a German bag, a bread bag.</span> <span id="s1246">It's a linen bread bad by a hanging strap where they were carrying their loaf of bread, and I had a razor there and a couple of small things, and that's all.</span> <span id="s1247">I was ready to escape, to be shot.</span> <span id="s1248">That's all I wanted.</span> <span id="s1249">I felt I'll never wind up in concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1250">And I instructed my niece to do that, too.</span> <span id="s1251">When they marched out, about four o'clock in the, early in the morning, I tried to be the last line, and I was about in the last line.</span> <span id="s1252">I was about the closest to the right side to be able to run in a, in a, in a private house garden.</span> <span id="s1253">It was through a little gate.</span> <span id="s1254">I planned to do that, but I realized that Schmittus was not in the back and he's not the one to decide in the first place where he would stay.</span> <span id="s1255">And all he did is tried to sell me a bill of goods I should try to save myself and believe him.</span> <span id="s1256">And with that, I may, I may survive.</span> <span id="s1257">And that's all that he wanted: to help me to survive.</span> <span id="s1258">As soon as we walked out, Christa Kartigas (ph) took us -- I think it was Christa Kartigas.</span> <span id="s1259">We walked out maybe twenty steps from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1260">I saw an open gate, that little pri-- that little gateway to a private house.</span> <span id="s1261">You, you know what I mean.</span> <span id="s1262">I ran in, and I ran through the garden.</span> <span id="s1263">And a Lithuanian was working in the garden, and he followed me and he caught me.</span> <span id="s1264">And I loosened myself, and he remained with the same jacket that was supposed to be “beschlagnahmt” and the sleeves of the shirt, in his hands.</span> <span id="s1265">And I was already away from him.</span> <span id="s1266">And I kept running and running and running, until I came to a big fence that was – the, the Lithuanian government had had built up a huge animal, animal in -- animal, animal treatment for -- how do you call it?</span> <span id="s1267">A, a – to, to, to cure animals.</span> <span id="s1268">Oh, my God.</span> <span id="s1269">I forgot.</span> <span id="s1270">I forgot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">03:49:40</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">Q: Oh, like an animal treatment center.</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">A: Ok, yeah.</span> <span id="s1274">And it was a huge tall gate.</span> <span id="s1275">And I couldn't, I couldn't possibly climb over the -- in my height.</span> <span id="s1276">It just happened that a pile of garbage was laying right there where I find myself.</span> <span id="s1277">I climbed up on the garbage, climbed over the gate.</span> <span id="s1278">And halfway on my -- halfway to the building, I see there are hundreds of German soldiers.</span> <span id="s1279">So I ran back, climbed over -- from the inside, it was easier to climb because there are the two planks, the bottom plank and the top plank.</span> <span id="s1280">It was easy for me to climb back in, and I continued walking.</span> <span id="s1281">I walked all day long.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">And a tremendous rain storm broke out.</span> <span id="s1283">And I hid in the corn to hide myself from the rain.</span> <span id="s1284">How much I can hide myself from the rain, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1285">But I, I was, I was like a animal, really.</span> <span id="s1286">My mind was like a animal.</span> <span id="s1287">And the four guards, when I escaped with -- and, and, and when I walked out from the corn, my body was all smeared up in clay.</span> <span id="s1288">And I, I slept the night over in a, in a, in a, in a forest.</span> <span id="s1289">And the next morning, I continued.</span> <span id="s1290">By then I was hungry and thirsty, and I was making up my mind which house I should attempt to go in and ask for something.</span> <span id="s1291">And I noticed a big looking house, a big building, and I thought maybe, maybe, maybe a owner of property -- they call it pomeshchik,in that time -- and most of them were Poles.</span> <span id="s1292">They, they're land owners.</span> <span id="s1293">The rich land owners were Poles.</span> <span id="s1294">And the Poles were not so hot with the Lithuanians, and he may have been willing to help me, give me some food.</span> <span id="s1295">So I started to go to that house, because I thought it's the owner of a rich man, because it's a bigger house than the average.</span> <span id="s1296">When I came close enough, I noticed it's the Ninth Fortification.</span> <span id="s1297">And I went back, and I started again walking.</span> <span id="s1298">About noontime, I fall asleep -- weak and hungry, and smeared out in clay like, like , like a stray cat.</span> <span id="s1299">And while I fall asleep, I heard voices of children -- Lithuanian voices saying, "Zydu!</span> <span id="s1300">Zydu!</span> <span id="s1301">Ectu (ph) Gestapo!"</span> <span id="s1302">-- "Run to Gestapo!"</span> <span id="s1303">So I got up, and I went away.</span> <span id="s1304">I, I, I, I just didn't had enough strength to continue from hunger and thirst.</span> <span id="s1305">So I walked in, in a yard of another house.</span> <span id="s1306">I took the next best house which to walk in, and I walked in.</span> <span id="s1307">It just so happened that the house was up front, and the barn was all the way in the back.</span> <span id="s1308">So it took me a distant to go to the barn.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">And halfway to the barn, the whole barn was full with German soldiers retreating from the army down the hill.</span> <span id="s1310">And the proprietor was a old Russian farmer, a gentile, Christian.</span> <span id="s1311">And he saw me, measured up the situation right there and then, came over towards me and embraced me like he was, he caught a new relative who just came to visit him.</span> <span id="s1312">Pushed me out from the area, walked in the house, gave me a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s1313">And I continued walking.</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">03:52:24 I walked for quite a distance.</span> <span id="s1315">Then I came to a highway where a lot of Lithuanians were escaping from the war.</span> <span id="s1316">The war was coming nearer, closer and closer.</span> <span id="s1317">And I lined up and I and I lined myself up with the horse and buggy of a Lithuanian with a family, and he gave me something to eat and let me walk with him.</span> <span id="s1318">But he told me if the Germans should come and look for, he will tell me -- he will tell them -- that I am a Jew.</span> <span id="s1319">So after I relaxed and thought on this moment for a few minutes, I continued to walk by myself on the upper hill of</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">44 Landowner (Russian)</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">45 Jew (Lithuanian) the, of the forest-like highway.</span> <span id="s1322">It was no forest.</span> <span id="s1323">It was little trees.</span> <span id="s1324">And towards late at night, again it started to rain, and I was terribly wet.</span> <span id="s1325">I walked in, in a house.</span> <span id="s1326">It was a man and two women -- brother and two sisters.</span> <span id="s1327">They gave me milk and bread.</span> <span id="s1328">I, I ate fancy foods all over the world.</span> <span id="s1329">Nothing tasted as good as that bread and milk.</span> <span id="s1330">They took me to the barn.</span> <span id="s1331">They dug out a, a wagon full of hay which they had prepared from the field.</span> <span id="s1332">They put me in the, in the hay, and they covered it back up.</span> <span id="s1333">I slept half a night, and early in the morning I continued to walking.</span> <span id="s1334">I walked all day, practical all day.</span> <span id="s1335">Again hungry, without any food.</span> <span id="s1336">And suddenly I'm facing three roads: one, two, three.</span> <span id="s1337">And what do I do?</span> <span id="s1338">Where do you go?</span> <span id="s1339">So I pick a grass.</span> <span id="s1340">You know when you were a child, a grass -- "You love me, you don't love me."</span> <span id="s1341">And I pulled the grass, and I designated this one is this grass, this one is this one.</span> <span id="s1342">And it fall on the one I went.</span> <span id="s1343">I went originally to the straight one.</span> <span id="s1344">And I continued.</span> <span id="s1345">Late in the evening, I came to a house and the woman took me in and told me that her husband is hiding Jews in the forest, and I should.</span> <span id="s1346">After she gave me to eat, she, she sent me upstairs in the attic.</span> <span id="s1347">And this early in the morning, he came home, he woke me up, and we started to go to the forest.</span> <span id="s1348">He was looking for signals.</span> <span id="s1349">He was removing trees and looking for signals.</span> <span id="s1350">And we find after a while he did find a signal.</span> <span id="s1351">And the most amazing thing, in the midst of the darkest area, well, now you couldn't see any further, any further, he, he bend down two trees, two branches.</span> <span id="s1352">And we walked in, and we find ourself in the midst of a field with Jewish men and Jewish women and children.</span> <span id="s1353">Was a group of maybe 20, 30 people.</span> <span id="s1354">And they had dug out a, a, a hole and covered with, with, with grass.</span> <span id="s1355">And anytime there was a danger, everybody walked down in the hole and, and, and they stayed down there.</span> <span id="s1356">I stayed there for the first day, the second day.</span> <span id="s1357">It was already in mid-July.</span> <span id="s1358">That was already the third week, or the second.</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">03:56:48</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">Q: There's only four or five minutes left, so we should try to -- there's only four or five minutes left so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">A: We have only four or five minutes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">Q: Yeah, so maybe we should usually get moving.</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">A: Little bit.</span> <span id="s1364">Anyhow, then we had to move from there, because the front was coming closer and the Germans were coming closer.</span> <span id="s1365">Then we, we, we couldn't get anymore, the farmer couldn't get to us.</span> <span id="s1366">And we didn't had any food.</span> <span id="s1367">We had to go by, we had to go in turns to the farmers to beg for food.</span> <span id="s1368">And there were German soldiers walked out from one side of the house, and we walked in the whole, in the other side of the house.</span> <span id="s1369">Both had the same purpose -- to beg for food.</span> <span id="s1370">And after three, four weeks -- after three weeks, exactly on July 4th, the war was over, and I was liberated.</span> <span id="s1371">And I came back to Kovno, and that's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">Q: Ok.</span> <span id="s1373">Is there anything else that you'd like to, in this last couple of minutes, is there anything?</span> <span id="s1374">I know there's many, many details that you'd want to add.</span> <span id="s1375">But is there any particular thought?</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">A: I don't know what details I can add, except for while I -- and I immediately took off to go back to Kovno, and I didn't wait for the ceremonies and parades.</span> <span id="s1377">And while there was a curvy highway, and while I was going down the curve, suddenly a, a, a rifle is in my stomach.</span> <span id="s1378">I lift up my hands and shouted who I am.</span> <span id="s1379">And the soldier removed his rifle.</span> <span id="s1380">It was a Russian soldier, and he didn't know what to speak to me.</span> <span id="s1381">I didn't know how to speak to him.</span> <span id="s1382">But he called over a Jewish soldier, and I told the Jew who I am.</span> <span id="s1383">And he cried and all the other soldiers cried, and everybody else cried then.</span> <span id="s1384">After a couple of hours crying, I, after a half hour, I relaxed and went back to Kovno, and went, went to Kovno.</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">03:58:55</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">Q: So that was your first encounter?</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">A: My first encounter with the liberating army, yes.</span> <span id="s1388">That were my first encounter.</span> <span id="s1389">Q: And how long did you remain in Kovno?</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">A: I was liberated August first.</span> <span id="s1391">And I, and I made the arrangements.</span> <span id="s1392">I met Jonas Petronis, my former associate and my former friend, who became again the manager of all the office product properties.</span> <span id="s1393">And within the first two weeks, I was walking around from garbage can to garbage can in the Lithuanian houses to try to get some food.</span> <span id="s1394">And from the day I met him, I became a multi-millionaire.</span> <span id="s1395">I became so rich.</span> <span id="s1396">He was taking up properties, car loads of properties, from the Communist hands -- which was originally my own merchandise, or part of my own.</span> <span id="s1397">And I was selling it on the black market.</span> <span id="s1398">I was walking out on the street with a pencil in my hand.</span> <span id="s1399">I had three Jewish with big suitcases standing behind me in the gate, and a young officer was running by, and behind him two soldiers, Russian officer, behind him two soldiers.</span> <span id="s1400">And we passed him by.</span> <span id="s1401">And then he cursed, and cursed word, "Blatzky rod!</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">Karandashi, Karandashi!</span> <span id="s1403">"A pencil.</span> <span id="s1404">It dawned on him what I have.</span> <span id="s1405">And he run back, and he saw my pencil and what, wanted to know how many I have and how much, how many I have and how much.</span> <span id="s1406">And he shouted to the Russian, to the soldiers to come over.</span> <span id="s1407">And they should pour over all the money in my suitcase, and I poured over all the -- within a week's time, I became a multi-millionaire.</span> <span id="s1408">It's went all to the devil, but that's beside the point.</span> <span id="s1409">I opened a kitchen immediately and hired two Jewish woman to cook for the hungry Jews -- free of charge, naturally, knowing myself the way I am.</span> <span id="s1410">And I was running around in the city, and I selling, inviting people to come and eat.</span> <span id="s1411">I met a rabbi, a older man, Mordchai Pagramanski (ph).</span> <span id="s1412">And when I was liberated, he came to the, to the forest where we were.</span> <span id="s1413">What happened to him is not to be believed.</span> <span id="s1414">They decided -- the Germans were, were exp-- throwing bombs over the buildings, to destroy the hiding Jews.</span> <span id="s1415">And when it came to his part, they decided that then, the officer said, "Mittagszeit, Feierabend.</span> <span id="s1416">"And they stopped, and they went to eat, and they didn't came back the same day.</span> <span id="s1417">So they decided to escape, and they delegated him to go to the German guards to ask permission to run away.</span> <span id="s1418">And while 46 “Fuck your family!</span> <span id="s1419">Pencils!</span> <span id="s1420">Pencils!”</span> <span id="s1421">(Russian) 47 “Midday, break time.”</span> <span id="s1422">(German) going to look for the German guard, he stumbled in on somebody, and that somebody was the German guard, dead drunk.</span> <span id="s1423">And he decided if the guard is dead drunk, he does not have to ask him permission.</span> <span id="s1424">And they all started to go.</span> <span id="s1425">And they marched dozens of kilometers, crossing over the whole German Army, with the big beards -- seven, eight Jews with the big beards.</span> <span id="s1426">And they all arrived at the same place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">Q: Ok, I think the tape just ended.</span>
