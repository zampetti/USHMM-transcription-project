1995</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: I'd like you to start by telling me your name, your date of birth, and your city of birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: My name is Father Henry Van Den Boogard and I was born in Holland in in 1915, so I will be 80 in August.</span> <span id="s13">Maybe I don't look that old, but they gave me some makeup to look a little bit younger.</span> <span id="s14">I don't know if it works.</span> <span id="s15">What else do you want to know?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: Tell me a little bit about your family and your background?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: My family went from , a big city in the south of Holland to a neighboring town, that was smaller, and my father had a printing business there, and he started a newspaper.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">That is where I grew up there.</span> <span id="s19">I went there to grammar school.</span> <span id="s20">When it was over my father put me in the school in the neighbor city and he thought that is a better school for a high school, but I didn't like it there.</span> <span id="s21">They had brothers there, religious people teaching, and I couldn't get along with the teacher.</span> <span id="s22">Everything that went wrong, I was always blamed for it, so I want to get rid of that school.</span> <span id="s23">I didn't know how I could get rid of that school.</span> <span id="s24">One day it was Ash Wednesday, and we catholics go to church get a little bit of these ashes on your forehead.</span> <span id="s25">I thought this was a nice opportunity for me to miss the bus.</span> <span id="s26">So, I had to go by a later bus.</span> <span id="s27">In the meantime I was waiting I thought that cross that they put on my forehead was too little, so with some ashes I made it larger and each time a little larger and later it covered my whole forehead.</span> <span id="s28">I forgot about it and then I went by bus to school and it was a very cold day.</span> <span id="s29">It was in 1929.</span> <span id="s30">When I came in the class, all the boys started to laugh because of that cross.</span> <span id="s31">I had forgotten it and I told the teacher I went to church this morning to get the ashes, and he sent me out.</span> <span id="s32">He said get of here.</span> <span id="s33">I had to stay in the hallway.</span> <span id="s34">And there I got my vocation I always tell because then I decided I don't want to go to this school anymore, but how can I convince my father.</span> <span id="s35">I thought I'm going to tell him I want to go to the seminary.</span> <span id="s36">He listened, so we went.</span> <span id="s37">I didn't think that I would be accepted because everybody told me you will be back home after a few weeks.</span> <span id="s38">So, when I came there, I thought I will fool them a little bit and I thought all the boys will become priests but I was the only one of the class who became a priest.</span> <span id="s39">What else do I have to tell?</span> <span id="s40">I was then 13 years old.</span> <span id="s41">I went to the seminary.</span> <span id="s42">I was accepted there, but I didn't expect and I prayed a lot that I wouldn't be sent home because of my conduct.</span> <span id="s43">My prayers were answered I think.</span> <span id="s44">That's what I tell in my sermons, that the prayers are answered.</span> <span id="s45">I asked in my prayers that I wouldn't be sent home, so they kept me there and I became a priest after 12, 13 years.</span> <span id="s46">I was ordained in 1942, and that was in the middle of the war.</span> <span id="s47">Before the war -- during the war already, in 1940, in 1942 more or less, there was a Jewish family in Holland.</span> <span id="s48">They were good friends of my uncle, and this gentleman asked me if I could help him.</span> <span id="s49">He approached me when I was still a seminarian.</span> <span id="s50">He said can you do something about it.</span> <span id="s51">I see that it is difficult for us Jews in the country with the Nazis and I would like to go hiding.</span> <span id="s52">He was married, and I said I will look into if I can find a place.</span> <span id="s53">Then in the meantime, my uncle found already a place with his brother, Louis Haza, and he had a sister, Anna Haza, and they both were single and they took him in.</span> <span id="s54">There was a husband and wife and a little daughter.</span> <span id="s55">The wife was pregnant and in the time they were hiding there, the little boy was born, and it was very dangerous.</span> <span id="s56">But what happened to them later, their name was , and I never found out if they survived the war or not.</span> <span id="s57">When I was ordained in 1942, it was the last Sunday of July then the first Sunday of August was August 2.</span> <span id="s58">I said my first mass in Holland and there was a big celebration in town.</span> <span id="s59">It was a town of about in those days about 10,000, now there's 20,000 people, but there was a big celebration, and a parade and everything.</span> <span id="s60">In the afternoon there was a reception, and the mayor came also to the reception and his name was John , and he was very anti-Nazi, anti-German, and he was very sleepy when he came to the reception.</span> <span id="s61">He said you have to excuse me because the whole night I had to visit Jewish families.</span> <span id="s62">I didn't know there were so many Jews in our home town, but he had to tell them that they had to go into hiding because that same night they would be arrested.</span> <span id="s63">And there was a policeman and he was in favor of the Nazis.</span> <span id="s64">He fought always with the mayor because they had different opinions and the mayor was very anti-Nazi so at the end of the war he had to go into hiding himself.</span> <span id="s65">That is why I knew there were quite a few Jews in my hometown.</span> <span id="s66">Then I didn't do anything until I had a brother-in-law, his father was born in Germany.</span> <span id="s67">He just got married, then, in those days, and his father was born in Germany, so the Nazis made all the decedents who were born in Germany, they made them German so they could serve in the military service.</span> <span id="s68">But my brother-in-law didn't want.</span> <span id="s69">He was the husband of my sister who lives here with me now and my brother-in-law, his name was Robert .</span> <span id="s70">He died already about 20 years ago.</span> <span id="s71">He asked me if I could help him.</span> <span id="s72">So, I had to find out where he could go into hiding.</span> <span id="s73">I found out then who the leader of the Resistance was in that area.</span> <span id="s74">There was , in Rosenthau and he said oh he can stay here.</span> <span id="s75">And , I would like to mention him because he did a lot for the Jews.</span> <span id="s76">He's not living anymore but in those days everything was so secret he didn't tell me that he had a Jewish family in his house too hiding.</span> <span id="s77">He was working with a priest who was a trappist before.</span> <span id="s78">He was still a trappist but they were kicked out of the monastery by the Nazis.</span> <span id="s79">Then he had to find a place so he became a chaplain in a very large nun's convent in Rosenthau.</span> <span id="s80">But he was only a name chaplain.</span> <span id="s81">What he did was working for people who wanted to go into hiding especially Jews.</span> <span id="s82">He did a lot.</span> <span id="s83">He was smuggling weapons and things like that and finding hiding places to keep those Jews alive.</span> <span id="s84">But he was not very prudent and we thought some day he will be arrested and it happened.</span> <span id="s85">He was arrested.</span> <span id="s86">His name was .</span> <span id="s87">I didn't name his full name, I knew only as Fonse, his nickname, but not his last name.</span> <span id="s88">I found it out later.</span> <span id="s89">He went to a concentration camp in , close to my hometown, but he was last seen in the , in the police office when he was arrested.</span> <span id="s90">But we never heard of him later.</span> <span id="s91">We didn't know what happened to him.</span> <span id="s92">Now, when the war was over, the leader of this Resistance in , he became the leader of this concentration camp where no Jews were anymore but were just the Nazi prisoners.</span> <span id="s93">I was then assistant in the North, but I went to see him in the South and I visited him, I said, did you ever find out what happened to Fonse, I said don't know, and he said I don't know either, but I know of a famous architect and he knows of somebody in the who works there and he was hiding with priests somewhere in the west of .</span> <span id="s94">So, I got the address of the architect and this architect was making a model for a monument in Holland on the for the freedom we got after we were freed by the Americans.</span> <span id="s95">He said this gentleman he works in an office in the .</span> <span id="s96">It was closed.</span> <span id="s97">So, I went there by car, that was given to me by the leader of the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s98">He's a soldier, so when I saw him, it was lunch time, there was nobody anymore in the office, only one gentleman and he knew me.</span> <span id="s99">I said how do you know me.</span> <span id="s100">He said do you not know me anymore?</span> <span id="s101">You helped me go into hiding.</span> <span id="s102">I said when was that?</span> <span id="s103">I said I have no hair I was a prisoner in and they cut my hair I was bald headed and he had a prison suit on and I was going to be executed in the neighborhood of Rosenthau and they brought me there with other prisoners who were going to be executed too but then we were attacked by the English planes and we all left the cars and could go into hiding in the corn field.</span> <span id="s104">It was not corn, it was wheat.</span> <span id="s105">We could crawl through the weeds the fields to the neighbor town where I was living.</span> <span id="s106">It was during the hours that there was a curfew at night, so in the morning I had to go Rosenthau to bring some pictures of Jews who had to have false identification cards and there was a teacher in town who took those pictures.</span> <span id="s107">He was an amature.</span> <span id="s108">He took those pictures, developed them at night, and early in the morning as soon as the hours were over of the curfew, then I was going to pick them up and bring them to Rosenthau to have my brother-in-law who was hiding he had to make those i.d. cards.</span> <span id="s109">So, when I went through the town I saw in a hallway of a house I saw somebody standing in the suit of the prisoner's bald headed and he called me.</span> <span id="s110">He said can you find me a place where I can stay.</span> <span id="s111">I brought him then to a place where the brother of Doctor DeBeer, he was a physician, and his brother was a priest, he was in hiding too.</span> <span id="s112">I brought him there.</span> <span id="s113">So, as soon as I told me who he was, I thought this is not the one who was hiding with Fonse so I was just as far as I was in the beginning.</span> <span id="s114">I did find out.</span> <span id="s115">Later on I came to Paris and I wanted to know so badly where Fonse was if he was still living or not so I had on radio his name if somebody knew about him, his whereabouts to let me know.</span> <span id="s116">So, I got a letter from the abbot of the monastery, he said as soon as you know let us know.</span> <span id="s117">We want to know what happened to him, too.</span> <span id="s118">I got a letter from his relative in Hague, they wanted to know also where Fonse was, if he was still living.</span> <span id="s119">But then I got a letter from a doctor in , where the concentration camp was.</span> <span id="s120">He said I saw when he was dead, I had to make a certificate that he was dead.</span> <span id="s121">He was killed on that day.</span> <span id="s122">It was two weeks after he was arrested.</span> <span id="s123">Now there is some monument for Fonse in that nun convent and he's on the list of the ones who were killed in .</span> <span id="s124">But, now we don't know much about him, but I wanted to emphasize more what , the leader of the Resistance.</span> <span id="s125">And Fonse , this priest what they did for the Jews because it was never recognized.</span> <span id="s126">Nobody knew and nobody knew the names.</span> <span id="s127">They never gave the names, but I know, because I worked with them that they were hiding Jews making false papers for them, i.d. cards and trying to keep them alive by finding food so I would like to emphases that now that I have the opportunity to make it known what they did during the war.</span> <span id="s128">So, that is what I usually did.</span> <span id="s129">I didn't do much myself, only I did on my bike brought i.d. cards to people who were hiding.</span> <span id="s130">Once I was asked by to bring a few guns in a shoe box on the back of my bike to the town where I was living for the underground.</span> <span id="s131">I did it and I put two Dutch catechisms on top of them so if I had to open maybe I thought it could save me.</span> <span id="s132">When I drove back on my bike, there were no cars on the road anymore only and I saw far away that there was control by the Nazis.</span> <span id="s133">People some people had some food they took the food away, and they used it for themselves.</span> <span id="s134">And I thought, what will they do now.</span> <span id="s135">When I go back they will see that I have something to hide.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Then it's more dangerous for me.</span> <span id="s137">So, I thought, the Lord will help me.</span> <span id="s138">So, I went through it and when they stopped me, what's in that box and then I got an idea.</span> <span id="s139">I said I don't know what's going on today but the third time I have to open that books everybody wants to know what's in that box.</span> <span id="s140">Then he said okay go ahead, so I was shaking very much but I saved my life.</span> <span id="s141">That's what I did, but it got a little bit too dangerous for me there in the South.</span> <span id="s142">They found out what I did, so I was advised to go into hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: Okay, I just want to ask you a little bit more about this period in the South.</span> <span id="s144">I'm going to back track a bit.</span> <span id="s145">When the Nazis came into Holland, what happened?</span> <span id="s146">What was the reaction?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">What was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: I was in the seminary and it was before I was ordained and I remember from a window in the seminary we were watching when they marched into the town, and we were extremely mad because they invaded our country and we tried to defend it with only a few days that our soldiers could defend our country, but then they just overthrew us.</span> <span id="s149">There was no end to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">We were extremely mad, and then they were going to throw bombs, that was before.</span> <span id="s151">The older seminarians had to go into the basement and we spent their nights and days in the basement, but what was going on in other towns we didn't know too well.</span> <span id="s152">I only went at night, early before the other seminarians and the teachers they got up.</span> <span id="s153">I went already to Rosenthau on the bike after the curfew hours to bring pictures and books to the people who were hiding to keep them busy and to have their false i.d. cards made.</span> <span id="s154">It was all I knew about the Resistance.</span> <span id="s155">I didn't know what was going on in other towns.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: How did you know about this man who was leader of the Resistance?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: There was a seminarian and he worked in the underground too.</span> <span id="s158">, was his name, and he had relatives in the town and they knew who their leader was, and I had to force him to let me know who he was and as soon as I knew, it was already before I was ordained, I went to see him.</span> <span id="s159">He was very friendly and he was living still quite a few years after we were liberated, but then he died.</span> <span id="s160">But his son is still living and his son is now I think he was in those days about 15 years old and he said his father was a little bit crazy.</span> <span id="s161">In those days he couldn't talk about anything after the liberation about then what he did during the war for the people who were hiding in the Resistance.</span> <span id="s162">He was so proud of it, but during the Resistance he didn't tell anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: What motivated you?</span> <span id="s164">How come you decided to take this on?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: It was just my Christian duty I thought to help people who were in trouble.</span> <span id="s166">I had to do what I could to help them, and it was also because it was for my relative, my brother-in-law to find a hiding place and then I thought I only have to find a hiding place and he was very intelligent.</span> <span id="s167">He knew several languages very well, but he didn't know Latin, he couldn't stand it so I brought him books to study Latin and books from the library that he could read and I thought that is it.</span> <span id="s168">But then this leader , he wanted little by little, more and more to do something for the Resistance, so I came very much involved in it.</span> <span id="s169">So, and Father Fonse.</span> <span id="s170">Father Fonse I saw at house very often, and I knew that the only thing he did was working for the people who were hiding.</span> <span id="s171">He could go to Belgium.</span> <span id="s172">He had papers.</span> <span id="s173">He brought many people over the border to bring them to England and after there was a priest also in the seminary.</span> <span id="s174">He was a teacher, and he had a contact with the underground, but there was not a good contract because the people he recommended to bring to be brought to Switzerland, they all got caught.</span> <span id="s175">They all got taken prisoners, so he asked me if I could give the address, so I gave the address of the contact I had.</span> <span id="s176">This priest died a few years ago.</span> <span id="s177">Then when it got too warm for me I had to go there were many priests home because during the war we wanted to go before the war already to the Mission countries, to Indonesia or South America.</span> <span id="s178">I didn't care, but we couldn't leave the country because we were occupied by the Germans.</span> <span id="s179">They didn't let us go, so I had to find a place to work as a priest so somebody found for me a place in the northern part of Holland, .</span> <span id="s180">I became their assistant, but that was a town that was quite abandoned and there were very poor people living in huts.</span> <span id="s181">They were digging, one of those things used for fuel, like bread, this dried plants from centuries and they were living in huts and that was an ideal place to hide their people in that place.</span> <span id="s182">There I knew some people that worked with me.</span> <span id="s183">For example, a retired nurse.</span> <span id="s184">She was living across the street directly her name was Sister Nista, they called the nurses always sister.</span> <span id="s185">She was not a nun but this Sister Nista, and she did a lot for the people that were hiding.</span> <span id="s186">She helped me a lot too.</span> <span id="s187">The pastor he acted like he was helping a lot but he was afraid.</span> <span id="s188">He was very afraid so I never told him what I did during the war.</span> <span id="s189">One day -- can I keep it for later -- is the tape almost finished because I cannot tell too much about the time I was up north.</span> <span id="s190">One day I had at the beginning already several people hiding and they were from Amsterdam and one day two ladies came on a bicycle all the way from Amsterdam and I don't know how many kilometers, maybe 200 kilometers because it was close to the German border, and they came and asked me where their husbands were.</span> <span id="s191">They knew that they were there and that I had them hiding and I gave them the addresses.</span> <span id="s192">They stayed a few days and then they went back to Amsterdam, but I had a friend, who passed away in Amsterdam, Father , and he couldn't write, so nobody knew where I was.</span> <span id="s193">I said would you please give my regards to Father who is in Amsterdam in the parish and tell him that I knew him well.</span> <span id="s194">So, they did.</span> <span id="s195">Father asked them is there still food in that place where he is, and they said it seems so because he's providing food for our husbands.</span> <span id="s196">Then I got a ship of kids from people -- should I tell that later?</span> <span id="s197">Father he collected many kids and they were catholic kids, Protestant kids and Jewish kids.</span> <span id="s198">He chartered a ship and he couldn't let me know but there was one nurse who came with those kids and the ones who owned the ship they went over and started to say , they came over canals and rivers to the town where I was.</span> <span id="s199">One day on the first Friday of the month, I was hearing confessions and I saw a gentleman coming in church and he looked around and he saw me and he came to me and said are you Father Henry from the beaugard and I said yes.</span> <span id="s200">He said I am from Itica and Itica is a town that is close to where he was and he said there's a ship in Itica staying over night on the river and it's full with kids and they're starving.</span> <span id="s201">There was no food enough to keep them alive in Amsterdam and Father collected them and he heard that there was still food so quickly I had to find all places, families who wanted to take a kid.</span> <span id="s202">But after that, after I had placed those kids, I didn't know their names.</span> <span id="s203">I didn't know which religion they had.</span> <span id="s204">I didn't know anything about them.</span> <span id="s205">Later on, Jews came.</span> <span id="s206">They all got that address from Father , and then I got a couple of Jews and then I got another couple and then more and more and I never knew if they were Jewish or not, and I found places for them, and there was a baker.</span> <span id="s207">There was an organization also, an underground organization in that town and there was a Protestant Minister and he belonged to that organization and he could get the rations, the coupons, and I got from him enough coupons all the time for all the people in hiding.</span> <span id="s208">But one day he asked me to give him a list of all the people who were hiding and where they were.</span> <span id="s209">I said I'm not going to do that because we are not going to give any names and I don't know their names.</span> <span id="s210">Then we have to stop to get you coupons.</span> <span id="s211">I said then I'll have to find another way.</span> <span id="s212">So, I found then a group in , that was another town, and I got in contact with the underground there and from them I got the coupons which I needed until they changed their mind in the town where I was and I got coupons from them again.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: When I was there up north, they asked me many times from the Holocaust, can you give any names.</span> <span id="s216">How people did you help?</span> <span id="s217">I said I didn't know.</span> <span id="s218">I didn't know who was a Jew or who was not a Jew, but I knew there were many Jews among them, and there were a few who got a little bit homesick, and they wanted to go close to Amsterdam where they came from.</span> <span id="s219">Then I there was no way to travel by train.</span> <span id="s220">There was no train going any more, no bus.</span> <span id="s221">No cars, there were no cars, only by bike.</span> <span id="s222">Then I found I could borrow a few bikes, and then they had little boys who were strong enough for the ride from .</span> <span id="s223">We went to I don't remember, with the underground.</span> <span id="s224">In there was a river, and it was difficult to cross that river because there was so much control from the Nazis.</span> <span id="s225">So, I could bring him to with the bike and then those people who were hiding, those adults, riding the bike and on the back seat was a little boy but the boy was strong enough to ride back to the home town.</span> <span id="s226">That was a whole day riding.</span> <span id="s227">I think it was.</span> <span id="s228">I don't know how far it was.</span> <span id="s229">I went with six people and it was a distance of a few hundred yards between me and the next one and the next one, and I said, I was in front, when I put my hand on the lantern, that means there is danger.</span> <span id="s230">See that you find a hiding place.</span> <span id="s231">Don't continue.</span> <span id="s232">I'll find you later, but we didn't need it.</span> <span id="s233">So, I did it several times to bring people back to , but had to cross the river.</span> <span id="s234">I gave there in the hands of the underground and there was a lot of people who worked for the Nazis, the , and they got some tickets to cross the river in the morning and in the evening, and the underground they got hold of some of those tickets and they could give it us.</span> <span id="s235">So, those people were and got a ticket too and walked over the bridge with those people to the other side and then they had to find their way.</span> <span id="s236">But they never found out who they were in the town there was a pastor from , and I became quite popular there because people were saying since Father is here, something is done for the people that went into hiding.</span> <span id="s237">It was known.</span> <span id="s238">I didn't tell people, but they found out anyhow.</span> <span id="s239">Then the pastor got a little bit jealous.</span> <span id="s240">He said before Father came here nothing was done, so much is done for the people that went into hiding.</span> <span id="s241">That is why I didn't tell the pastor anything, but later on I had no more places to hide, no more families, then I asked the pastor can I use the parish hall.</span> <span id="s242">The parish hall was not used for anything.</span> <span id="s243">He first said no and I got a little bit upset about it, and later he came to me and said it's all right, you can use the parish hall.</span> <span id="s244">So, I found straw to sleep on and pots and pans and everything and then I had so many people because we are close to the German border, it was at the end of the war and many people could come through -- it was a march between our countries and we were about a mile from the German border, and once I remember they told me that there were a few people they called , because there was a before and then many people were picked up and they had to work in a factory and they could escape and then they went through the swamp to their hometown.</span> <span id="s245">Then they told me there are a few more, so I thought I'm going to meet them on the bridge.</span> <span id="s246">Then I saw them walking, and I knew one of them.</span> <span id="s247">He was a former seminarian.</span> <span id="s248">He said what are you doing here in Germany.</span> <span id="s249">You are not in Germany, you are here in Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Then they cried.</span> <span id="s251">They were dirty and full of lice and so on.</span> <span id="s252">They had gone through the march.</span> <span id="s253">There was a lot of water and so on.</span> <span id="s254">There was not a road.</span> <span id="s255">So, I said go into church.</span> <span id="s256">I come in the church through the rectory and you can take a bath.</span> <span id="s257">They give some clean clothing and so on and some food and then I'll find a place for you to hide here.</span> <span id="s258">What the two of them were I don't know, but the other one he was a catholic.</span> <span id="s259">His name was Chris , and then there was the one I knew from the seminary.</span> <span id="s260">What else can I tell you?</span> <span id="s261">I had many kids in different places and I didn't know their names and I didn't know their religion but they had to go to school.</span> <span id="s262">Then I found out there were quite a few Jewish kids among them, too.</span> <span id="s263">There was one catholic boy and he heard two years ago when I was celebrating my golden anniversary in my hometown, he heard about, and he was one of those kids and he was now a rich guy close to Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s264">He was an exporter of tulip bulbs to foreign countries, and he came to the reception.</span> <span id="s265">Now, last year or this year he came to visit me, but I didn't like him very much because he was very egotistic and never paid anything.</span> <span id="s266">He was here for about six weeks.</span> <span id="s267">I went with him to Virginia to cut the time a little bit.</span> <span id="s268">I had to pay everything and he was not satisfied with the food that my sister made.</span> <span id="s269">He asked for other food, so I couldn't stand him any more.</span> <span id="s270">I was glad when the six weeks were over, but that was one of the boys.</span> <span id="s271">That's the only that I knew the name from.</span> <span id="s272">All the other ones I never knew the name.</span> <span id="s273">His name was Chris .</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: How come you didn't know anyone's names?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: Because you didn't want to.</span> <span id="s276">It was too dangerous to find out the names.</span> <span id="s277">The names of those kids I don't know if it was in those days that you were hiding them if I knew the names, but I don't remember any.</span> <span id="s278">I don't know if I got the names.</span> <span id="s279">I didn't know the names of the people we were hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: Let me ask you a question.</span> <span id="s281">When you were hiding people, did you just hide everybody that came through, or was there a priority?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: They had to have a note from Father in Amsterdam, and he signed it only A.V., Adrian , and then I trusted them.</span> <span id="s283">But one morning, in the middle of the night one day, I heard the bell ring very little, and I had my room on the second floor of the rectory and I had my window there outside and I looked out of the window and there was a German soldier staying and they had long overcoats, and he said can I talk to you.</span> <span id="s284">I said what about.</span> <span id="s285">I would like to talk to you, so I let him in, and I thought I have to be very careful.</span> <span id="s286">He told me that he was a German soldier and that his family was in Germany, but he said I don't think that we will win the war.</span> <span id="s287">I don't want to fight any more, I want to go into hiding.</span> <span id="s288">He asked me if I could give him the address of the leader of the Resistance.</span> <span id="s289">I said I don't know.</span> <span id="s290">I didn't trust him.</span> <span id="s291">I thought maybe that the Nazis that they sent him over in the middle of the night to find out who are the ones helping the Nazis and the people were hiding.</span> <span id="s292">I asked to the pastor's bedroom, he said kick them out, kick them out.</span> <span id="s293">He was in bed.</span> <span id="s294">I gave him food.</span> <span id="s295">I gave him a sandwich.</span> <span id="s296">I said I'm sorry, I cannot help you.</span> <span id="s297">He left finally, after insisting very much about what the address is.</span> <span id="s298">I don't know any address.</span> <span id="s299">He said what do you do with people.</span> <span id="s300">Well, I tell them the same thing that I don't know how to help them.</span> <span id="s301">Later on I was very worried that maybe it is the truth that he was a real soldier that he wanted to go into hiding and my conscious was bothering me so much that I didn't help him.</span> <span id="s302">But I thought on the other hand maybe he would have given the names of the ones that were in the Resistance and they all would be arrested, so I tried to forget about it, but I never could forget it.</span> <span id="s303">A few ladies later a policeman from the town came directly and told me that it was too much known that I did something for people who were hiding and I had to go into hiding myself.</span> <span id="s304">So, I went to a couple a brother and a sister.</span> <span id="s305">They were single, and they were already older and he was a furniture maker, and I could go into hiding there, but it was not far from the rectory.</span> <span id="s306">Through the window, my bedroom window I could see the rectory.</span> <span id="s307">I watched at night all night if I could see Germans coming to the rectory to pick me up, but I didn't see anybody, and after a week nobody came so I started again to live in the rectory.</span> <span id="s308">That's about all I can remember from the time I was there in the northern part.</span> <span id="s309">Everything was the same all the time.</span> <span id="s310">Helping Jews, helping other people who were hiding.</span> <span id="s311">People who were picked up a lot of them who had to work in factories in Germany who came through the march.</span> <span id="s312">I had to find places.</span> <span id="s313">I had to find food for them and to keep them alive.</span> <span id="s314">It was difficult because those people didn't get rations, and those people who got rations got very little too, so I had to go to that was another town where many farmers, and I went through the fields of the moss, no, that dried stuff that they use for fuel, peat, there was only railroad track for those small railroad cars.</span> <span id="s315">Take a bike over those beams, and there was a shorter way too but there was no control.</span> <span id="s316">They went from farm to farm and back for some food.</span> <span id="s317">I got here potato and a little piece of meat so from a baker I got many rations from the underground.</span> <span id="s318">I told you that already.</span> <span id="s319">I did have money.</span> <span id="s320">I got some money from a girl who was working in the black market and her conscience was bothering her I think and she gave me sometimes 100 then 200 , money I used because there was not enough to buy all the food.</span> <span id="s321">So, I said, I will pay you back after the war is over.</span> <span id="s322">I don't have any money now.</span> <span id="s323">So, when I was on vacation from the United States in Holland, I went to that town and that couple was still living, the baker.</span> <span id="s324">The baker's wife said are you coming to pay the bill for all the bread you got here.</span> <span id="s325">I said oh, I forgot all about it anymore, but she died, but he is still living, and I saw him the last time I was in that town.</span> <span id="s326">He was an old man in his 90s, but he was a good friend.</span> <span id="s327">Hartman was his name, and he helped a lot.</span> <span id="s328">He had also people hiding in his house.</span> <span id="s329">I don't know if they were Jewish or not, and I told you about the electricity.</span> <span id="s330">We were without electricity but we still had a line outside.</span> <span id="s331">Now, it's all under the ground, and the Germans they cut it all to the houses, but the baker still had electricity because he had to bake bread for the Germans.</span> <span id="s332">One night I could steal that electricity to have light in the rectory, but the pastor didn't want to know.</span> <span id="s333">One day yet very late and they went when it was already dark.</span> <span id="s334">They said it's now too dark to make the connection, I said no I don't want to sit by candle all night.</span> <span id="s335">So, but then it was in the dark and I couldn't see it too well and I missed it and it was sparking sparks like fireworks, sparks all over, and then I had to call an electrician early in the morning to restore it.</span> <span id="s336">The baker couldn't bake bread early in the morning for the Nazis, but they never found out.</span> <span id="s337">But people know now about it, but a few later last time I was in Holland I went to that town and I went to the church, this is a new church in another place and when I was there in the rectory were very abandoned.</span> <span id="s338">I thought I go to the cemetery to see the names of the graves of the people I knew.</span> <span id="s339">There was somebody working in the cemetery and I said, did you know all those people, he said yes.</span> <span id="s340">I said what's your name?</span> <span id="s341">He said are you a policeman or so?</span> <span id="s342">I said no I'm Father Henry Van Den Boogard.</span> <span id="s343">He said are you Father Henry Van Den Boogard?</span> <span id="s344">He hadn't seen me in 50 years and he married a girl who was a sister of the girl who worked at the rectory.</span> <span id="s345">He came now too to my golden wedding anniversary to the reception.</span> <span id="s346">There were about 16 people from that Parish and they had to come all the way from the north.</span> <span id="s347">They had to drive for hours to get there and four hours to go back.</span> <span id="s348">I don't remember too much about those days in the north.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: Let me ask you, when you were in the north, how long were you up there in</span></p> <p><span id="s350">?</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: I tried to find out.</span> <span id="s352">I was there until the war was over.</span> <span id="s353">As soon as the war was over I wanted to go to see if my family was still living, because they fought a lot there, and there was no contact at all.</span> <span id="s354">So, as soon as possible, I had an opportunity once in who was originally his parents were living in the Parish, but he was a soldier during the war in 1940, and he was in the south.</span> <span id="s355">His group had to go to England and he became an English soldier.</span> <span id="s356">After the war he came with the people to liberate the country and he came to visit his parents in a pick up truck.</span> <span id="s357">He didn't see his parents for a long time and he heard about him.</span> <span id="s358">I went to him and I said, are you going back, he was closer to the hometown of my parents so I could go with him in the truck and bike through the cities, which soon after the war because I remember on them there was a city that as evacuated.</span> <span id="s359">There was nobody living any more.</span> <span id="s360">It was a dead city, not even a dog you could see on the street.</span> <span id="s361">There we stopped for a while.</span> <span id="s362">Do you have any more questions?</span> <span id="s363">It's easy for me to talk when you ask me questions.</span> <span id="s364">I am now to the point where I would like to be asked.</span> <span id="s365">I told all I can remember more or less.</span> <span id="s366">This 50 years ago, my memory is not too good anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: When you said you were in until the end of the war, do you remember what year you went there?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: Yes, I think it was in '44 until the war was over in '45.</span> <span id="s369">No, I was there longer, a little more than a year, I think.</span> <span id="s370">Very close to the Rectory there was a farmer.</span> <span id="s371">He had a big farm, and he was a Protestant.</span> <span id="s372">He was from , and he was a Nazi, and he watched us all the time.</span> <span id="s373">I knew that they had to be very careful, but I didn't know his name.</span> <span id="s374">I didn't know what happened to him, but after the war all the Nazis were picked up and punished.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: You were right near the border, so were there a lot of Germans and Nazis around?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: No, not in the town where I was because there was a highway that went through the office where the Nazis were controlling everything that came through, and then there was a side road and maybe about two or three miles long and there was that town, along side a small canal where I lived, where all those poor people were living, and we were not bordered by Germans at all.</span> <span id="s377">Only they tried to find out later when I found that German soldier in the middle of the night standing there in front of the rectory.</span> <span id="s378">I wanted to have some names.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: What about Dutch Nazis?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: Oh, yeah, they were hidden by the people.</span> <span id="s381">After the war they were picked up and they had to parade through the streets with their hands on their head and soldiers surrounding with their rifle and the people were shouting at them and so on.</span> <span id="s382">Also, the girls who dated German soldiers their hair was cut off completely.</span> <span id="s383">They were bald headed, and so I had some books with a lot of pictures but I lost them all in Chile, pictures about the concentration camps and so on.</span> <span id="s384">During the war I didn't know too well what happened to the Jews.</span> <span id="s385">I knew that that they were put in concentration camps, but I didn't know that they were killed.</span> <span id="s386">I heard it after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: When you were going around this area looking for food, going to farmers, did they know why?</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: Yes, I had to tell them, but I didn't tell them for Jews because that was too dangerous.</span> <span id="s389">When they would know that you were helping Jews they would put you in a concentration camp and kill you, but I said certain people a lot of them were picked up on the street and in the churches to work in factories in Germany.</span> <span id="s390">I acted like it was all for them.</span> <span id="s391">The Hollands were very helpful when a priest came there to ask for food, sometimes they got one potato.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Sometimes I got a little piece of bacon and so on, but it all added up.</span> <span id="s393">But I didn't want to bring it to the rectory because the pastor had two sisters living there that took care of him but they want to have as much as possible for themselves, so I went first to Sister Nista across the street, that nurse, and I stored them there.</span> <span id="s394">At once she helped people who went into hiding, Jews or no Jews, and there was a guy who came there and he was hiding there in her place and the pastor and the people didn't know if he was a traitor or not.</span> <span id="s395">So, some from the underground came there and interrogated him and they acted like they were Nazis and he said I'm Nazi too, and he showed them the papers.</span> <span id="s396">Then finally he said we are not Nazis, we are from the underground too, and then he showed papers that he was from the underground, so they didn't know, but they let him smoke a cigarette and took him outside and killed him with a hammer, and they buried him in the peat and that happened before I came there.</span> <span id="s397">I knew exactly where he was buried and the companies were digging for that peat, they were getting close to that grave and I was afraid that they would find him, so I told him they had to go to another place.</span> <span id="s398">I don't know how I told them, but they didn't dig there further, so they didn't find the body.</span> <span id="s399">I don't know what happened with that body later either because when the war was over, I had a lot of people in the parish house.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: How many?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: Sixty, I think, to eighty, and then they left and then the new ones came in and I told one of the guys to put all the names down, but they never got the paper with all the names.</span> <span id="s402">It was difficult to keep them alive to find food.</span> <span id="s403">When the war was over we just said, I told the pastor I think we are liberated.</span> <span id="s404">They didn't come to us.</span> <span id="s405">They forgot us.</span> <span id="s406">They went to towns, the Allied and I think ring the bell and we are liberated too and then the pastor and I went on the bicycle over the border there was no control any more but there were some Canadians on the other side in German and I didn't remember much English but I tried to talk to them a little bit and they asked me for an i.d. card.</span> <span id="s407">They didn't know if I was safe or not, but we went to the pastor to get some mass wine and candles.</span> <span id="s408">In Germany they had everything planned here we didn't have anything.</span> <span id="s409">That's what happened after the war.</span> <span id="s410">Then there was a band but here you have high schools with band, but there they are adults and they don't have uniforms.</span> <span id="s411">They just get together and form a band, and they came to bring a serenade to the Jews who were hiding in the Parish hall.</span> <span id="s412">I remember that they standing there in their sloppy clothes.</span> <span id="s413">Their overalls are dirty.</span> <span id="s414">They are standing there all in line, but soon when I found out that it was a soldier from the Allies, he was a Hollander, and he was also at my reception a few years ago.</span> <span id="s415">I still have pictures of him here and I could just go with him to my home town, then the Pastor who was a little bit jealous of me because I was getting too popular he got a letter that I was appointed for Chile and he arranged right away for my farewell party.</span> <span id="s416">When I came back there was a farewell party and I didn't know where all those people who went into hiding where they went.</span> <span id="s417">They didn't know my name either, so I don't know, I went to the south and had a vacation and prepared to go to South America.</span> <span id="s418">So, I don't know what happened later.</span> <span id="s419">Only one I found and he had tuberculosis and he was in one of the provinces laying in bed.</span> <span id="s420">I went to see him.</span> <span id="s421">I think he got t.b. in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s422">I don't know what happened to him either.</span> <span id="s423">I don't know his name.</span> <span id="s424">I can't remember.</span> <span id="s425">I did remember it because I went to see him and it was far away from the town where I was assistant.</span> <span id="s426">It was between him and my parents in .</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: These people who were hiding there, did they hide for a few months and then move on?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: Some did.</span> <span id="s429">Some did until the end of the war.</span> <span id="s430">Some got homesick and it was difficult for the Jews because they were told they couldn't go out.</span> <span id="s431">They were locked up day and night for a long time, and I remember that once, one of the assistants came and he said this Jewish family and they can't stand it any more and they get out at night and walked around and that is so dangerous they bring the people where they are hiding in danger too, and we have to kill them.</span> <span id="s432">But I didn't want to have them killed, so there was one of the Resistance to save those people where they were hiding.</span> <span id="s433">So, I went to those Jews and told them to be careful and said you bring those people who are helping you into danger.</span> <span id="s434">I can't understand why you are getting so restless.</span> <span id="s435">If you stay day in night in that hiding place you ought to have some friends once in a while.</span> <span id="s436">That was the end of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: Were some of them trying to go through Holland and go south through France and Spain?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s439">That was in the beginning when I was working in the south.</span> <span id="s440">Fonse he brought many over the border and , too.</span> <span id="s441">There I knew that many people went into hiding.</span> <span id="s442">They wanted to go to England and they couldn't go via Switzerland to England.</span> <span id="s443">I don't know how many but I know that they were helped by the Resistance.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">End of Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: Tell me a little bit more about what you actually did.</span> <span id="s447">I mean you went to look for food.</span> <span id="s448">You went to the local farms.</span> <span id="s449">What other kinds of responsibilities did you take on and also did you sort of invent what you had to do or were you working with other people?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: I did all on my own.</span> <span id="s451">I worked a lot with that nurse across the street.</span> <span id="s452">She was a retired nurse, Nista, and I remember her name very well, but I don't remember the name of that nurse that came with all those kids.</span> <span id="s453">She was staying with the nurse, Nista.</span> <span id="s454">That's what I remember.</span> <span id="s455">I did it all on my own.</span> <span id="s456">I didn't want to tell anybody.</span> <span id="s457">I didn't even want to know the pastor or his sisters or the girl who worked there.</span> <span id="s458">The girl who worked there remembers still many things that I was a signet because she was about 17 years old at that time, I think, she came here last year.</span> <span id="s459">You have seen her I think.</span> <span id="s460">, she was here for a vacation for three weeks when I met her in Holland I heard her brother-in-law worked in the cemetery where I went and he said he was the brother-in-law of .</span> <span id="s461">He told me where she worked.</span> <span id="s462">So, I went to see her.</span> <span id="s463">She was a widow now, and when he came -- in Holland we don't wear a collar.</span> <span id="s464">It's just a tie, and she didn't recognize me.</span> <span id="s465">When I finally said who I was oh, she was so surprised after so many years to see me again and then I invited why don't you come to the United States.</span> <span id="s466">So, she did later.</span> <span id="s467">She came for three weeks, and she writes me now, long letters with all nonsense.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: But you were hiding many people in the Parish hall so obviously the other people in the Rectory knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: Oh, yes, they knew that yes.</span> <span id="s470">But they didn't know they were Jews among them.</span> <span id="s471">That had to be the most secret thing that we had to keep about Jews because that was too dangerous for the people who were helping them and the Jews themselves.</span> <span id="s472">Because the Jews were the enemies of the Nazis, but there were many people who went into hiding because they didn't want to work in Germany or they were picked up and were sent to factories and they ran away from there and came back to Holland and had to go into hiding.</span> <span id="s473">So, they were in Holland and hiding together with the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: Did the local people who were not actively involved in Resistance or underground activities, were they supportive?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s476">In the town where I worked it was quite catholic town.</span> <span id="s477">In the area where most of the people were not catholic.</span> <span id="s478">But almost everybody I asked to hide a couple didn't know many times they were Jews or not.</span> <span id="s479">They were always willing to share whatever they had with the people who were in trouble.</span> <span id="s480">In those days, the people had pig and somebody came to slaughter the pig and then they used to bring a piece of the pig to the pastor, those women.</span> <span id="s481">They were very uncivilized and they were talking about they called the Nazis the Poopers, I believe, it's better to give it to the pastor than the Poopers.</span> <span id="s482">I knew they had killed a pig and I went there and I said can you give me a piece too for the people who were hiding.</span> <span id="s483">I got some meat sometimes, but the meat had to be cut into small pieces to make soup, because it was too valuable to give big pieces to people separately and a lot of bread from Baker Hartman.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: Did you have to find clothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: I went to the south one time and got a whole truckload of clothing and bed in the south from my home town.</span> <span id="s486">There was a hospital in Tillburg and one of my relatives was the head nurse there and they got all new beds and I got about 50 beds and it was too much to bring them -- I had to rent a truck to bring them.</span> <span id="s487">Then I said to the pastor you divide it because I couldn't keep a secret that I had a truck coming, and then he acted like he was giving it all to the people.</span> <span id="s488">Sometimes the people asked me they came to the door and said, can I talk to the pastor, okay, but they didn't want to tell me that they want to get some of the clothes that I got to the parish, but the pastor acted like it was all from him because he said nobody's supposed to know it, but he was not very cooperative.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: So, he took some of this for his own purposes?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: Yes, food more, and clothing, they gave some clothing to that girl that was working there, .</span> <span id="s491">I remember they selected -- I had an uncle who had a factory in Tillburg.</span> <span id="s492">He had a very large textile factory and I got a lot of stuff from him, rolls of material and I brought only a bike and I thought after the war I thought I have to travel so much I have to get a motorcycle, but I got papers that I was working in the underground as chaplain, so I could get gas because it was all rationed, and then I got a motorcycle from somebody who had the motorcycle hiding because they were afraid it would be taken in, but it didn't have tires.</span> <span id="s493">But a boy worked in Germany and he came back with some tires and I gave him a roll of material instead and then I got from him the tires for the motorcycle.</span> <span id="s494">Then I went around in one of those little motorcycles, and I got more rations for gas than I needed.</span> <span id="s495">I could help other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: So, there was a lot of bartering?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s498">Those things I never thought of it anymore.</span> <span id="s499">Now, you asked me and it comes back in my mind, those things.</span> <span id="s500">There were many, many things which happened and that I don't remember, but sometimes something comes up and I remember other things connected with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: There was an active black market?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s503">There was a girl close to the rectory and that girl did a lot of black market and she thought it was sin and then she wants to buy her sins off by giving money to me to help the people who were hiding.</span> <span id="s504">Everybody knew that I was hiding people but it was not too dangerous.</span> <span id="s505">Only a policeman he came to the rectory once and said he has to be more careful because he will be arrested and then I went into hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: So, the local police helped you as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: No, they were too afraid, not very much.</span> <span id="s508">Not very much, I got in touch with only one policeman, and I remember that when I told those people hiding in the parish hall that there was one guy and the other guy, former prisoners, they said he was helping the Nazis and they called it a , the one who tortured people to get secrets out of him, but he was a prisoner himself.</span> <span id="s509">Then I went to the local police to have him arrested, but when I came back, he disappeared, had disappeared already.</span> <span id="s510">He knew that probably I was going to do something about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: Now, weren't you afraid?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: I don't remember, maybe I was sometimes, but maybe not.</span> <span id="s513">I had sometimes people hiding in the rectory and then we were told there will be in the rectory to come to control and then we didn't have time to hide those people so we were wearing a cossack in those days and we gave them a cassock and a prayer book and said walk in the church up and down like you're saying your prayers.</span> <span id="s514">You are assistant here.</span> <span id="s515">But I didn't know what religion he was, but I said act like you are a priest.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: Now, some of these Jewish people, some you knew, some you didn't, did you have to teach them how to act like Christians, how to cross themselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: No,</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: None of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: I think the people where they were hiding told them.</span> <span id="s520">Q: The other people?</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s522">Because most of the people who were hiding Jews they were all catholic and they knew how to handle them and they knew how careful they had to be because their own life was in danger.</span> <span id="s523">They lived very poorly.</span> <span id="s524">In the town where they were cutting that peat they had piles like bread and high as a house piled up and there they made a hole in it and people were hiding and families were living in those holes so they couldn't be found.</span> <span id="s525">They never got caught.</span> <span id="s526">I never lost anybody as far as I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: Do you have any sense whether some of these Jewish families could in any way practice their religion?</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: No, no they couldn't.</span> <span id="s529">Q: You're positive?</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: Later, after the war was over we had a meeting in a Protestant church for the people who worked among the people in the Resistance.</span> <span id="s531">There were several priests and I asked them about it too, and we couldn't.</span> <span id="s532">We didn't have any rabbis.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: What do you think when you were working, doing all of this, was your biggest difficulty?</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: I think to keep everything secret.</span> <span id="s535">Not to talk about it at the table with the pastor and his sisters what I was doing.</span> <span id="s536">But they knew that I was working, helping people when they were in hiding, but they didn't know exactly what I did and who I was helping, where they were.</span> <span id="s537">I had to keep my mouth shut.</span> <span id="s538">This is sometimes difficult when you get along with those people every day.</span> <span id="s539">Oh, I fooled them a lot.</span> <span id="s540">I tell a joke, this Baker Hartman, the pastor and his sisters had a little dog, and the dog died and then they got another dog the same size and the same kind.</span> <span id="s541">But the dog was not house broken and when you came in the rectory there was a stairway and then the landing and every morning on the landing there was some dog droppings, so I asked the bakers I said can you make some droppings from bread, dog droppings, they look dog droppings like bread.</span> <span id="s542">He said, oh yeah I can do that.</span> <span id="s543">He enjoyed it I thought I want to fool the pastor and his sisters so I put it there on the landing and then that girl that came here for vacation , she came down and we were going from the kitchen to the dining room and she had on a duster and had those dog droppings which was bread.</span> <span id="s544">I said what do you have there?</span> <span id="s545">Oh, Micky did something again, and I took one and I said it don't look too bad to me and I took a bite of it and those sisters -- oh, that I was eating dog droppings.</span> <span id="s546">I said it's good do you want to try too?</span> <span id="s547">I thought the pastor was going to call the Bishop.</span> <span id="s548">I don't want an assistant who eat dog droppings so I told him it's just bread.</span> <span id="s549">I had it made.</span> <span id="s550">I did those things to add a little bit of entertainment.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: Did you ever find yourself in a position besides providing the sort of logistical support for these people to have to give them some sort of emotional or psychological?</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s553">I had to talk to them a lot and then they were all right as long as I was talking to them, but I don't know later.</span> <span id="s554">Like I talked about that family who were almost going to be killed because they were restless, getting restless.</span> <span id="s555">Almost everybody was restless in those days and it was a great difficulty to keep them quiet.</span> <span id="s556">Then to talk to those people, the pastor didn't go over, they had go to bring communion to those people on first Friday and those people were hiding and they had to go through the snow.</span> <span id="s557">You couldn't see where the road was because the snow was blowing and those dikes and so on and sometimes I fell in the snow up to here in the snow, and then I had to visit those people.</span> <span id="s558">I had food with me for those people and rations.</span> <span id="s559">It was difficult to keep them alive, but I don't remember too much about difficulties any more.</span> <span id="s560">You forget about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: Did you have time for your regular priestly duties?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: Yes, I didn't have too much.</span> <span id="s563">I had to visit people regularly and I did it and confessionals all at the same time.</span> <span id="s564">The people who were hiding, and I had to say mass on Sundays and during the week I had to preach and prepare a sermon and so on, but before that there was no assistant at all because it was a small parish.</span> <span id="s565">But then I came and the pastor knew what I was doing and he let me do it and he didn't bother too much.</span> <span id="s566">He didn't ask too much either.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: Now, when you were getting food coupons for example, from these other organizations, I'm curious about systems, how you knew about each other, how many organizations there were?</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: I knew only very few of the organization in the place where I was working.</span> <span id="s569">I knew them through a Protestant minister and he got the rations, and I knew also especially in the south when they were preparing theft to steal those coupons which were stolen, taken away from the Hollanders and they were stolen by people from the resistance and they gave them to us and we could give them to people who were hiding.</span> <span id="s570">That helped a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: How did you know these other organizations?</span> <span id="s572">Were you coordinated?</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s574">The guy in , a guy I got to know through the pastor and also in the pastor of was arrested too.</span> <span id="s575">We never knew what happened to him if he was killed, but there were two priests who took care of the parish and they knew who was the leader there in .</span> <span id="s576">I went to him and I told him that they want from me a list of all the people who were hiding and where they were hiding and I don't want to give them, and they said we will take care of them.</span> <span id="s577">Then I got coupons from them.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: Early on, a few years before this, didn't the catholic church in Holland really come out and protest against the Nazis?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: More or less after Cardinal DeYoung had a letter read in all the churches.</span> <span id="s580">Q: When was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: It was, I think, '42 and at that time all the priests were in favor of helping Jews, but not all.</span> <span id="s582">I remember in when we brought some people there to go give in hands of the organization there to cross the river, then I had to stay over night in .</span> <span id="s583">I had an address from the pastor where I could stay but the next morning I wanted to say mass and he told me to go to that pastor.</span> <span id="s584">He said no the other one.</span> <span id="s585">There were two catholic priests, but I did remember which one was right and which one not, so I went to the pastor and I said I have to bring some people who are hiding.</span> <span id="s586">Oh, you are one of those, he said, I said the priest , do you want to be arrested, too?</span> <span id="s587">I said who pays for the wine and the candles and so on.</span> <span id="s588">I just wanted to walk away but he let me say mass and I thought I will not go there any more.</span> <span id="s589">He was not very cooperative, but that was an exception.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: Do you remember sort of the general reaction when the Cardinal wrote this letter?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: I remember that the Nazis, the Dutch Nazis when they found out about it, they went to the rectory and the man did the letter, but they got several letters in case they had to give one to the Nazis then they had another letter to read at the next mass.</span> <span id="s592">That was very dangerous too, because there many times they were asking us in the church, the Nazis came into the church and arrest all the men in the church and brought them to the railroad station and the cattle cars, they were sent to Germany.</span> <span id="s593">And they had to stand there so close to each other and when they had to go to the bathroom they had only a bottle to pass from one to another and they had to pour it out.</span> <span id="s594">That was difficult.</span> <span id="s595">The Jews the same way.</span> <span id="s596">They were arrested by large groups.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: Do you think that the Dutch Nazis were more tolerant of priests who did not support them?</span> <span id="s598">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: You were in the same boat as every one else?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s601">They were very anti-religion.</span> <span id="s602">Against the catholics, they were more or less the scum of the town.</span> <span id="s603">They were not the well education people, the Dutch Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: Do you think that the clergy was very instrumental in terms of the underground efforts in Holland?</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: As far as I know yes, but I don't have much experience of other parishes because we kept everything so secret.</span> <span id="s606">We didn't talk to each other about when we were helping people.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Sometimes we found out but many times we didn't even know, but we could, if we had to tell something we could trust them.</span> <span id="s608">Many priests were arrested.</span> <span id="s609">Many priests were sent to concentration camps.</span> <span id="s610">You heard about the priest who took the place of one who was going to be killed and he will be canonized was his name.</span> <span id="s611">He was a polish priest.</span> <span id="s612">I remember also that there was a , he was arrested too and killed and his ashes are now kept in the cathedral in , and I knew him personally.</span> <span id="s613">I had once dinner with him.</span> <span id="s614">He is much older than I am.</span> <span id="s615">I was just a seminarian when I knew him.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">will be canonized too, I think, because he is considered as a saint.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: Was the reaction more anti-German or did people really want to save Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: Both.</span> <span id="s619">They felt sorry for the Jews and they found it very that they were persecuted so much, and we hated the Nazis.</span> <span id="s620">In the school we had to learn many languages, French, German and English.</span> <span id="s621">The kids didn't want to learn German any more so it was out of this, and many schools give up to teach German because people didn't make the home work, because they didn't want to out of the hatred for the Germans.</span> <span id="s622">This all now changed because the Germans they come to Holland for vacation, to the beach, but in those days -- but still many are very anti-German because of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: Prior to all of this was there any sense of anti-semitism in Holland among church people among regular people?</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: Not that I know of.</span> <span id="s625">Before we had very little contact with protestants but during the war we were fighting the common enemy, then we got together and I got to know many Protestant ministers and we worked together and they tried to help and during the war they were brought together, the clergy of the different denominations.</span> <span id="s626">In Europe you don't have so many denominations, not in those days, as you have here.</span> <span id="s627">You had the Dutch Reformed and the , translated is also a reformed, but it is two groups and they are very, very Protestant.</span> <span id="s628">They don't do anything on Sundays.</span> <span id="s629">You can't play cards, so they're reformed.</span> <span id="s630">I don't know about the rabbis.</span> <span id="s631">I don't know many of them because in the south there were not many.</span> <span id="s632">I didn't know there were so many Jews in my home town until this mayor told me that in the whole night he was working on finding those Jews to tell them that they had to go into hiding that they would be arrested.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q: Were you -- I guess you were in the seminary, but I'm wondering in the early years, were you aware of all the decrees against the Jews that restricted them and all of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A: That came little by little.</span> <span id="s635">Also, we were rationed little by little.</span> <span id="s636">First you couldn't get this, then you couldn't get that.</span> <span id="s637">Later on, if we all came to the same time we wouldn't have survived.</span> <span id="s638">You couldn't buy soap.</span> <span id="s639">You couldn't by tooth paste.</span> <span id="s640">You couldn't buy shoe shine, nothing, clothing, and you had ow when you want to buy for example toothpaste, you had to give first the empty tube to get a new one.</span> <span id="s641">Then they make jokes that when you want to have a new child you have to turn in an old man because they saved everything.</span> <span id="s642">They made soap from many dirty things and so on.</span> <span id="s643">There was nothing.</span> <span id="s644">You had to wash clothing with no soap.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: Now, you went to probably around 1944 so you were in the southern area before that.</span> <span id="s646">Were there other activities there that you haven't told me about?</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: No, there was more people that I had to contact but I didn't know--we had sometimes English flyers who were shot down and hey were arrested and we had sometimes in the seminary hiding, and then we had also one of our seminarians was very good in astronomy.</span> <span id="s648">He started a university and he built -- what do you call it to look at the stars?</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: A telescope?</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: Yeah, a big one, and we had a tower which you could open and the Germans they occupied it and they used it to look around for the telescope to see if they could find people that were hiding or something, I don't know.</span> <span id="s651">We were in the studying and those marble steps those Germans with those heavy shoes, they came in with the steel under the shoes and we could hear them fall sometimes and then we were happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: How did you know who to trust?</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: We trusted many people.</span> <span id="s654">We trusted Hollanders and we knew who were the Nazis, the Dutch Nazis.</span> <span id="s655">They were very disliked by the people.</span> <span id="s656">Soon everybody knew who was in favor of the Nazi and favor of Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: People were taking big risks so some people weren't willing to do that.</span> <span id="s658">I'm sure there were informers?</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: A few or so but you knew soon what they had done to other people and then like I talked about Father Fonse he was very imprudent.</span> <span id="s660">He was very hard working.</span> <span id="s661">He didn't do anything than hiding people, finding food and smuggling weapons and so on, but he talked very freely but he never told me any names.</span> <span id="s662">But I found out many things after the war.</span> <span id="s663">I have a niece in Holland, she married my nephew and I asked her, because from the Holocaust they were asking for me about details about Father Fonse and she investigated everything and she went everywhere.</span> <span id="s664">She went to Belgium and Holland and to meetings and so on, and see I have those papers some where and I looked for them and I can't find them.</span> <span id="s665">They are , she did a lot, but she was not born during the war, she was born later, but she did a lot to find out about Father .</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: Did you distinguish at all between Jewish people who converted to Christianity or catholicism?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: I know a few.</span> <span id="s668">One Jew became a trappist and then a girl also became a nun and they were also arrested and killed.</span> <span id="s669">I knew about them.</span> <span id="s670">I didn't know them personally.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: But it didn't make any difference in terms of who you were trying to help?</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: Oh, no we helped everybody who was in need of help, and we didn't ask what religion they were, we just helped them.</span> <span id="s673">We trusted them too, we trusted people so much, maybe too much, but we were very lucky.</span> <span id="s674">I had a few times that I for example, when I had that control in the road when I had that shoebox with guns then things like that when my life was in danger, but not very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">End of Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: All of these families who helped you hide people, helped you in your work, were they compensated?</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: I don't know if they were compensated after the war, but not during my time, and I didn't tell them that they were going to be compensated, no, nothing.</span> <span id="s679">They didn't ask for money.</span> <span id="s680">They did it to help people.</span> <span id="s681">In the south, my brother-in-law did a lot for the people who helped him to hide.</span> <span id="s682">He sent them gifts all the time and things like that after the liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q: When you think of your work with the underground, your own work, what do you think it's greatest failures were, if any, any weaknesses?</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: I think in my hometown I heard later that sometimes things were discovered, and there was a group working had a book laying and was edited the anniversary, 75th anniversary of the paper that my father founded and there I read a lot about what people did during the war in my hometown, but I didn't know it in those days, but I was not living there.</span> <span id="s685">I was living in the seminary, and I was ordained during the war, and during the war we could not go to the missions where I was going to appointed later for South America.</span> <span id="s686">I didn't know during the last years of the war where I would go, so I knew that I had to do something in Holland and by coincidence in touch with the underground and that is why I started to work for them, but after the war, so many people in Holland talked oh I was in the underground too.</span> <span id="s687">Everybody wanted everybody to know that they worked with the underground, but many people made up things.</span> <span id="s688">Then we didn't care about it anymore.</span> <span id="s689">We didn't want to talk too much about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">For example, this lady, she's here in the United State, she wrote a book and she talked to many groups, , you heard of her I guess.</span> <span id="s691">They worked, they did very much for the underground and the father had to watch the store or something.</span> <span id="s692">He had a few daughters.</span> <span id="s693">They were helping people and the sisters were killed in a concentration camp and she got -- many people ask me do you know her, because it goes around here and talks all the time.</span> <span id="s694">I thought many times I did the same thing, but I don't talk too much.</span> <span id="s695">But she has written books and she's on t.v. sometimes and it is like she was the only one who worked in the underground, but so many people -- but many people talk about it that didn't do anything during the war.</span> <span id="s696">They were afraid, but after the war everybody worked in the underground.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: Did you ever have second thoughts about what you were doing?</span> <span id="s698">Was it really burdensome?</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: No.</span> <span id="s700">I was proud of it, but I couldn't tell anybody, only after the war, and then I didn't tell too much because so many people were telling stories that I thought, my story doesn't make any impression.</span> <span id="s701">My family knew about it, and when I came here to the United States, I had a parish in Virginia, close to Williamsburg in West Point and sometimes people asked me what about during the war, and then I told them stories sometimes, and they were more interested, and I don't know, I think that some time people were asked if they knew somebody who helped Jews during the war to write to Washington, and there was a lady parishioner and her name was O'Connor, Sam O'Connor's wife, Helen O'Connor and she didn't write her name but she wrote the Post Office Box 53 and I remember that I found out who that was, it was Helen O'Connor and she worked that I did work for the Jews during the wars.</span> <span id="s702">That is why they contacted me from Washington with the or something in Richmond.</span> <span id="s703">You know him, because you talked about him.</span> <span id="s704">I was in correspondence with him for a while, and through him I got that award.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: Was there a sense of adventure about this that you were really combating the Nazi?</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s707">We were glad to do something about it, to fight the Nazis.</span> <span id="s708">We hated the Nazis so much and there is still a lot of hatred in Holland.</span> <span id="s709">They hate the Germans because of the war and that was so many years ago.</span> <span id="s710">And then they say we must forget it it is so long ago, but some people can't forget, especially the older people, but many young people there now today and that is why I'm glad to have the opportunity to tell something who don't believe in the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s711">They say it didn't happen.</span> <span id="s712">It's impossible.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: What do you consider your greatest accomplishment during all of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A: That was the contact I think with Father Fonse and and also what I did in , but the South I was more indirect helping by bringing photographs at night as soon as the curfew was over to Rosenthau, and then I came back on my bike and before they got up in the seminary I walked like nothing happened.</span> <span id="s715">I walked through the chapel for the morning prayers and I had been already in Rosenthau a half an hour driving, riding on a bike.</span> <span id="s716">So, I was proud of that and later on when I had to go into hiding in the north, I had to abandon all that work I did in the south, I told the director of the seminary, I said I have to confess something.</span> <span id="s717">I worked in the underground.</span> <span id="s718">He was glad to hear it but he didn't know it.</span> <span id="s719">I said now I have to have a successor and I wanted to have Father .</span> <span id="s720">I said I told him already about it, and he said I don't want him to do it, because he's not secretive enough, but I said I told him already and I gave him the address and he goes if this my brother-in-law and the leader of the underground nothing could happen.</span> <span id="s721">So, when they war was over they made him chaplain, Army chaplain, and then he went with the Dutch Army to Indonesia and then he came and they didn't know what to do with him so they sent me to the United States but I didn't do anything here.</span> <span id="s722">So, I was the assistant of provincial.</span> <span id="s723">They said we have to send him back to Holland then they made a pass through Germany, and he died last year.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: During this period of time, did you do things that you never would have imagined you were doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: Yes, all those things.</span> <span id="s726">I would never have imagined that I would have worked in the underground and helping people to hide.</span> <span id="s727">We were not prepared for that, and I had to do it all on my own almost, especially in the north.</span> <span id="s728">There was not very much organization.</span> <span id="s729">That's what our people said, when the Father came, Father Henry, something is done for the people in hiding, but the pastor didn't do anything, and that is why the pastor became jealous.</span> <span id="s730">It was not a happy time there in .</span> <span id="s731">means Black Sea.</span> <span id="s732">That was the name of the town, and the pastor -- he had no sense of humor and so on and I had to hide many things from him and he let me do things, but I don't know if he agreed on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: What was it in your makeup that enabled you to do what you did?</span> <span id="s734">What prepared you, I mean you weren't prepared to go into the underground, but what drove you that didn't drive that pastor and some other people in your background?</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: I think the pastor was too afraid.</span> <span id="s736">Q: What about you?</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: I was young.</span> <span id="s738">I was in the late twenties and I had everything.</span> <span id="s739">I didn't care.</span> <span id="s740">I was glad that I got that appointment is what made it a good covering to hiding there.</span> <span id="s741">I was proud of it, but I didn't tell anybody, but there was still a train going, but it took me a whole day, and I took my bike on the train, and after a while, it was a little bit before they called it .</span> <span id="s742">It was the day that the Allies started to invade Europe.</span> <span id="s743">A few weeks before I went to the north and there if you can find out when it was, when the Allies landed in Europe, was it '44?</span> <span id="s744">Then I went to , and I stayed there until the war was over.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: Did you need special skills to do what you were doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: I thought everybody was doing it.</span> <span id="s747">Every priest.</span> <span id="s748">It was not so, but many priests were doing it.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">We were in the opportunity to do something, they did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q: It didn't require any special talents or personality?</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: No, you had to be proud of doing something, to fight the Germans and to help the people who were in need.</span> <span id="s752">I have been all my life helping the poor.</span> <span id="s753">I went to South America and I was pastor there in the slum area.</span> <span id="s754">I worked first among the Indians, always among hungry people and then because there was so much trouble and poverty in South America that is why I came to the United States to find help for the poor.</span> <span id="s755">I went around here for many years to make appeals everywhere for the poor in South America.</span> <span id="s756">Then I became pastor in West Point, because I asked for a parish that I had to establish an office, and that's expensive, you have to rent a house.</span> <span id="s757">You have to pay the bills for lights and water and so on.</span> <span id="s758">I thought I better ask for a parish and have an assistant who would do that work and then we can continue the work for the poor.</span> <span id="s759">So, I asked for a parish and then I got first a parish in Portsmouth, Virginia, and the Bishop asked me you can make a choice.</span> <span id="s760">There was one parish, it was a black parish for Negroes and nobody wanted that.</span> <span id="s761">It had big debts.</span> <span id="s762">They let me take that.</span> <span id="s763">I had to make appeals to take the debt off.</span> <span id="s764">Then I started this discrimination to have a special parish for black people so I eliminated with the help of the bishop the bishop was afraid that there would be some trouble but I asked the bishop let us find out what the people want.</span> <span id="s765">If they wanted to have another parish in an area where the Negroes are living because I had a parish in a white area and they had to pass many white churches to go to their own, so we started first with the school to eliminate the school and that went through without any difficulty.</span> <span id="s766">Then we give them the parish and they had to pay off the debt.</span> <span id="s767">It was $250,000 and I paid it off by begging and so on, and then I got a parish in West Point.</span> <span id="s768">I talk to people sometimes when they ask me about the war, there was a guy --.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: So you integrated the parish?</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: No, yes the other parish was integrated in Portsmouth but many left the church because they didn't want to.</span> <span id="s771">There was a guy in Virginia, he was a German, his name was Kyle Rudolph and he was a Nazi.</span> <span id="s772">I didn't know that, but I found out later, and he was very rich.</span> <span id="s773">He was a multimillionaire.</span> <span id="s774">He had a business in West Point.</span> <span id="s775">I can tell it now because he died two years ago, and he had a big business in a factory in West Point.</span> <span id="s776">He gave a lot of money to the church, and his sister came once and she didn't like it too much.</span> <span id="s777">She said it's to buy off his sins because he did a lot of sins and he was living with a woman but he gave her $1,000 for the new church I was building.</span> <span id="s778">I didn't know he was a Nazi but I knew that he went every year to Europe but he never went to Germany.</span> <span id="s779">He went always to Austria.</span> <span id="s780">He had a house there.</span> <span id="s781">Then I found out he didn't have to go to Germany anymore because he thought he was sought because he was a Nazi.</span> <span id="s782">When I gave up the parish I started an organization to fight hunger in the world and then I went to live with my sister, but this guy, this multimillionaire was 75 years old and the personnel of the factory want to give him a party, and they ask me to come and give a speech because they thought I was a good friend of his.</span> <span id="s783">So, before the party it was in West Point at the house of one of the people who worked for him.</span> <span id="s784">He had a visitor over from Germany and he introduced me to that German.</span> <span id="s785">He said that is that priest who fought us during the war.</span> <span id="s786">I said what fought, what I did in war was helping Jews.</span> <span id="s787">Then he said, they should have killed them all.</span> <span id="s788">And that is the last thing I heard of him.</span> <span id="s789">He didn't want to have anything to do with me, but he continued to support the parish and my successors, they got money from him, and now I told him don't do it, because he is a Nazi and he is afraid to go to Germany and I think that some day he will be discovered by Nazi hunters and then he will pay for what he did, but he invited him to Bocco Raton where he had a big house.</span> <span id="s790">He invited those priests there and I had already three successors there and now he died, and they buried him in the cemetery, the catholic cemetery in the middle where the old pastors are buried and I protested.</span> <span id="s791">I told a priest who was my successor I said they shouldn't have buried him there.</span> <span id="s792">That's for a priest but not for an ex- Nazi.</span> <span id="s793">Then he said I will show you and he was dug up and put in another place.</span> <span id="s794">The pastor heard about it that I complained that he was buried there which was reserved for priests.</span> <span id="s795">An ex-Nazi to be buried there because they were very fond of him because he got money from him.</span> <span id="s796">That is the experience with Karl Rudolph.</span> <span id="s797">Then he was his enemy.</span> <span id="s798">He didn't want have anything to do with me any more after this surprise party.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: So you carried this with me in the United States.</span> <span id="s800">A: That was at West Point.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q: Let me ask you a question about Holland right after liberation.</span> <span id="s802">I suspect there were a lot of adjustments after the war between people coming back and the people who were in hiding and the economy and everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">A: It was a little difficult for many people.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Q: As a priest, what was your experience after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: Now, I don't have much experience because as soon as the war was over I went with this soldier in a pick up truck to .</span> <span id="s806">It took a whole day, and then I heard there I went to the seminary and they said congratulations I said for what.</span> <span id="s807">They said you're appointed for Chile.</span> <span id="s808">They sent a letter to the pastor when I was on my way to the south, so then I found out I got my letter there that I was appointed for Chile.</span> <span id="s809">Then I prepared myself more to go to Chile then I had to because in Holland you couldn't get any textile or so, but I got it in Belgium and I can tell many stories about that, too, how we got all that stuff and I had to smuggle it through Holland.</span> <span id="s810">Then I went soon to South America, so I don't know too much.</span> <span id="s811">I heard several things for several people it was difficult to adjust.</span> <span id="s812">They were used to adventures during the war, and then life was so quiet and calm and so that is why when I came to Chile I was also a little bit restless.</span> <span id="s813">I couldn't get used to that life not to keep any secrets so I asked for a difficult place so I went to the South of Chile and worked with the Indians for a while until I became an appointment for pastor in Santiago in a slum area.</span> <span id="s814">I worked again amongst the poor.</span> <span id="s815">Then they had to build a church.</span> <span id="s816">There was no income at all.</span> <span id="s817">There was no schools in the whole area.</span> <span id="s818">There were 30,000 parishioners so I was sent by the cardinal of Santiago, Cardinal--- I don't remember his name to the United States to see if I could find help for the poor in Latin America.</span> <span id="s819">So, I go to church with Bishop , you heard about him I guess and he invited me to dinner and each time I was in New York and he gave me some financial help too, and then I got a lot of parishes where I could make appeals and that's why I came here to the United States.</span> <span id="s820">Later it was difficult to make all the arrangements from Chile for the appeals.</span> <span id="s821">I had to come every year, so I established an office first in Portsmouth and then in West Point.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q: Is there anything else that you want to say about your work or the situation, your motivations, your church, any of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s823">A: Yes, because as a priest we are I wanted to be a priest first to get rid of that high school, but then later on I got my vocation during the seminary years, I just wanted to help people, people that were in trouble.</span> <span id="s824">So I worked almost all my life among the poor until I came here, but I worked a lot among the poor, and that is why I got involved in the underground I think.</span> <span id="s825">I got involved there without asking for it, but I welcomed the opportunity to do something especially for people who had to hide from the Nazis.</span> <span id="s826">The first thing I heard was from this Mr. , the Jew in my hometown with his family which was helped by uncle, and then by the mayor who came to my reception and he told me in secret he said I'm so sleepy.</span> <span id="s827">I didn't sleep a moment because I had to go out and find Jews, and then I found out that there were quite a few Jews living in my hometown.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: Did you know them?</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: No, because I was in the seminary.</span> <span id="s830">I didn't know much about my hometown.</span> <span id="s831">I was 12 or 13 when I went to the seminary and I went there only for vacation.</span> <span id="s832">I know only Mr.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">and his family who were friends of my uncle, and I heard later that they went into hiding but the brother of my uncle and his sister and that their child was born there.</span> <span id="s834">That was dangerous.</span> <span id="s835">But that is what I knew of my hometown.</span> <span id="s836">I was glad when the opening came for a pastor there in the north wanted to have an assistant because it didn't cost him anything.</span> <span id="s837">I would say mass and he could keep the money and I did work and he didn't have to pay for it.</span> <span id="s838">I didn't get any pay.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q: Did you know when you were going north that you would continue your underground activities up there?</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A: I was hoping that I would have an opportunity.</span> <span id="s841">I didn't know that I would have much more opportunities up north than I had in the south and up north I was more active directly.</span> <span id="s842">I found people and I had to keep them alive and I had found work and rations and food and money and places where they could stay.</span> <span id="s843">I enjoyed doing that.</span> <span id="s844">I was glad that I had that opportunity.</span> <span id="s845">In the south I worked more indirectly.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">Q: Anything else you want to say?</span></p> <p><span id="s847">A: I'm empty I think.</span> <span id="s848">I told everything I remember.</span> <span id="s849">Maybe later on I think I could have told that, but at the moment.</span> <span id="s850">The last days I have tried, before you came, I knew that you were coming and I was glad to have the opportunity because so many young people don't believe in the Holocaust so they now have an opportunity to tell from my own experience that the Holocaust really existed and I was trying to remember things but it is so many years ago, and I'm bad at remembering the names.</span> <span id="s851">I remember couldn't remember the names in the south of , who did so much for the Jews, but in the north I don't remember the Protestant minister who brought very regularly the coupons to the rectory.</span> <span id="s852">I remember he had on a bicycle and he had a basked in front of his bicycle where he had the coupons always.</span> <span id="s853">I remember those things when I talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">Q: Did you get any sleep?</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A: Yes, I got some, yes, but always that I could be arrested and so on.</span> <span id="s856">I knew someday whatever it never came but close.</span> <span id="s857">When that guy came, that German soldier at the door at the middle of the night I never knew maybe he was trying to hide and that he didn't want to fight anymore and I don't know if he got killed of not, but when I think about it I feel a little bit sorry that I did that, that I didn't try to find out more.</span> <span id="s858">If it was real what he told me or that he was making up things.</span> <span id="s859">I didn't trust him.</span> <span id="s860">But now after so many years, the people in that town, they talked about things which happened during the war which happened to me and that is why 16 people, they are poor people, they came all the way to my reception to the south, and they had to drive several hours, maybe three hours to get there.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q: Do you have anything else that you want to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s862">A: No, I'm glad that I have this opportunity.</span> <span id="s863">But I was afraid that I would not remember enough.</span> <span id="s864">I thought you came all the way from Washington and I have so little to tell.</span> <span id="s865">Do you think it is worthwhile?</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">End of Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Conclusion of Interview</span></p></body></html>
