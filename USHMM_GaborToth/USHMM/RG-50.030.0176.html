id="s10">April 21, 1994</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: Bella, could you give us your full name and where you were born and what year you were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: My name was Bella Pasternak.</span> <span id="s13">I was born Breock (ck) Simon Autashore (ck), Romania, Transylvania.</span> <span id="s14">(ck) Later on it became Orderra (ck), because when Hungary take it over, it became a different city.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: Can you tell us something about the town you were growing up?</span> <span id="s16">What year did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: I was born November 7th, 1928.</span> <span id="s18">I was a seven-month baby, and I was born the seventh child.</span> <span id="s19">We were two boys and five girls.</span> <span id="s20">The town was three-and-a-half kilometers from the city Dasch (ck), and it was a small town, mostly non-Jews.</span> <span id="s21">The population -- the Jewish population in our town was approximately 25 or 30 families when I was a small child.</span> <span id="s22">But we used to go into the city very often.</span> <span id="s23">We had a synagogue; we had a grocery; and my father was a blacksmith.</span> <span id="s24">He was from America here, where he learned a trade.</span> <span id="s25">In the early 1900 he came over as a young fellow, and he was partly -- he was talking about New York and partly about San Francisco.</span> <span id="s26">When he left behind his girlfriend, he went back in 1912 or 1911 -- or 1912 to get married.</span> <span id="s27">At that time the war broke out and they didn't let him come back.</span> <span id="s28">Despite he had the papers and the passport, they recognized him as a Hungarian -- as a citizen born there, and he had to go into the Army.</span> <span id="s29">By the time he came out from the Army, his passport expired and, therefore, he wasn't able to leave.</span> <span id="s30">And many times through the years that we were there, the passport was validated, and whenever -- it was validated, the government changed, and we were never able to leave.</span> <span id="s31">Even in 1940 we had all the passports to come over, but then Hungary came in and they didn't recognize any papers from around the world.</span> <span id="s32">And the town was very small as far as the population, the Jewish population.</span> <span id="s33">But we did have a Synagogue, a small Synagogue, and we had people that came from out of town to teach us Hebrew.</span> <span id="s34">We went to classes from the morning, early in the morning we went for Hebrew classes, and then we went to school.</span> <span id="s35">And Romania it was a very -- in the beginning it wasn't bad.</span> <span id="s36">But then they started just like here in the pogroms (ck).</span> <span id="s37">There was Krousa-coger (ck), just like the iron guard, who prosecuted the Jews.</span> <span id="s38">And they used to call names like: Jew, go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s39">But as far as more the situation in the city -- town that we lived, we didn't see.</span> <span id="s40">We went to school, and I went to school four years.</span> <span id="s41">And in four years I made seven grades.</span> <span id="s42">After seven grades there were no more classes in our town.</span> <span id="s43">But my mother was very religious.</span> <span id="s44">My father was more modern, because he was already an American, so he found the taste of modernization.</span> <span id="s45">My mother came from an ultra-orthodox family, that they shaved their heads, and they really kept it very, very strong.</span> <span id="s46">Whatever the Rabbi said, that's what -- written in the books.</span> <span id="s47">So when I won the scholarship, it took time.</span> <span id="s48">They said I could go for free.</span> <span id="s49">And then my father says: Look, we're not sending her.</span> <span id="s50">If they send her, let her go.</span> <span id="s51">Finally, then it came through, Hungarian took over.</span> <span id="s52">The Hungarian --</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: Would you stop for a moment.</span> <span id="s54">What do you mean; what scholarship did you win?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: I took -- the scholarship that I won, it was -- they had statewide scholarship.</span> <span id="s56">They had a test in math, in history and in geography.</span> <span id="s57">I was the youngest one, because I made seven grades in four years.</span> <span id="s58">So -- but I won in all three: In math, and history, and geography.</span> <span id="s59">So then they said that they would give me a special admission to college free -- for high school and college free.</span> <span id="s60">But my parents were so religious that our boys did not go to public schools.</span> <span id="s61">They went to Yeshiva.</span> <span id="s62">My brother went away.</span> <span id="s63">He went to Yeshiva and visits the Rabbi, Yeshiva.</span> <span id="s64">He become a Rabbi.</span> <span id="s65">And the girls went to school -- and to Hebrew school.</span> <span id="s66">So when I won the scholarship -- and my father said to my mother: We're not sending her.</span> <span id="s67">If they are sending her, let her learn.</span> <span id="s68">Because my father did not speak the language, because when he was born it was Hungary.</span> <span id="s69">Then he was in the States where he picked up a little English, and he came back it was Romania.</span> <span id="s70">So wherever he went, I went along with him, because he didn't know what he was signing.</span> <span id="s71">The language was altogether different.</span> <span id="s72">From Hungarian to Romanian, it's a different -- altogether.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Romanian is Latin, and Hungarian is a different language.</span> <span id="s74">So I used to go along with him, and he used to kid around, and he said: Here comes my lawyer, to let me know if I could read it or not, or to sign it or not.</span> <span id="s75">She will read it to me, and then I'll sign that if I could sign it or not.</span> <span id="s76">When Hungary came, we were a little happy from the beginning, because we figured there wouldn't be no more the iron guard.</span> <span id="s77">My mother remembered that she was born in the same town, it was Hungary; that the Hungarian people were pretty nice people.</span> <span id="s78">And it was all right from 1940 until 1941.</span> <span id="s79">In 1941 it became a new law.</span> <span id="s80">Jewish people weren't allowed to go to school.</span> <span id="s81">So my scholarship, first of all, wasn't good any more, because from -- Romania become Hungary.</span> <span id="s82">I had to go back to school and start with A, B, C.</span> <span id="s83">A different language altogether.</span> <span id="s84">After learning one year, we were expelled.</span> <span id="s85">We had to wear a Jewish star, and it was forbidden for Jews to go at night out, and to school altogether.</span> <span id="s86">So I went in the city that time, and I started to learn a trade, because my father, to rest in peace, he always said: No matter how much money you have, you always have to know a trade, and you have to know to do even for -- we had a girl coming in to wash the floors, she used to make us all do something to make sure that we all knew how to do it.</span> <span id="s87">In the house we were a lot of children.</span> <span id="s88">Some of them were away in Yeshivas, but we were a happy family.</span> <span id="s89">Like my father was working, he was a blacksmith.</span> <span id="s90">So in the beginning he used to work with 12-13 people, because he had people coming from all over for the backsmith work, and also was making the carriages.</span> <span id="s91">At that time there was no cars.</span> <span id="s92">So the carriages were made with wood, and he used to carve the wheels, but he -- he practiced, and he knew very well to make the carriages.</span> <span id="s93">He had workers in that department, and then he went in the other department where he used to put shoes on horses, and he put the iron and the wheels from the carriages.</span> <span id="s94">When Hungary came over, he was still doing that, and even towards the end he was working.</span> <span id="s95">In 1942 the situation got really bad.</span> <span id="s96">Everything was rationed: Milk, flour, sugar.</span> <span id="s97">You were allowed to get one pair of sole in your shoes one year.</span> <span id="s98">Everything that we had was sent to the Army, or even but -- what we didn't have -- if we didn't have it, they told you you had to deliver that.</span> <span id="s99">We had to go to the black market and buy it, and deliver it for pennies.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">But being you were a Jew, you had no other choice.</span> <span id="s101">We had a big house compared to the rest of the people there, because my father when he came from the America, after he couldn't -- wasn't able to come here, he bought land.</span> <span id="s102">And he bought a house, a big house, so we had a six-room house.</span> <span id="s103">So they taxed everybody according to their property.</span> <span id="s104">So, we had acreage that they used to give out for people from the town to work on it, and whenever they came out with the corn or with the wheat, we used to share it.</span> <span id="s105">Half was there for the labor and the other half was for us, because we keep the land, and we give them the seeds for it.</span> <span id="s106">Then they taxed them to such an extent that it wouldn't pay to give it out to workers.</span> <span id="s107">He finally give it to the workers, and the workers used to give us wheat or whatever from -- just for the ground, but the ground was written over to them.</span> <span id="s108">Then in 1942 it came around the Jews were paying more taxes than anybody else.</span> <span id="s109">If you made money or you didn't make it, they tax you.</span> <span id="s110">So one day they came in and they said: You have a six-room house.</span> <span id="s111">You have to pay so much and so much.</span> <span id="s112">My father, he should rest in peace, took a hammer and made five rooms out of it.</span> <span id="s113">He knocked the hole out.</span> <span id="s114">He says: You see, now I only have five rooms.</span> <span id="s115">He says my taxes -- because it was impossible to pay the taxes.</span> <span id="s116">No matter how well you were, in the end you become poor, because no matter what you have, it wasn't enough.</span> <span id="s117">Then everything was rationed.</span> <span id="s118">And I started -- I started to play the black market.</span> <span id="s119">I used to buy stuff and take it into the city where everything was available for money.</span> <span id="s120">And I become very friendly with the head of the police, the captain of the police, and he was Hungarian.</span> <span id="s121">There we had two kind of police in there.</span> <span id="s122">Some of them were called Rangles (ck) and some of them where called Chandles (ck).</span> <span id="s123">The Rangles (ck) were the local ones, that it was established there.</span> <span id="s124">The Chandles were coming from other areas.</span> <span id="s125">Once I got arrested.</span> <span id="s126">We didn't know -- I spent the night in jail when I was 12 years old, because two people rode the bicycle.</span> <span id="s127">Everything was reserved for the Army.</span> <span id="s128">I didn't know.</span> <span id="s129">I rode from the city, the three miles.</span> <span id="s130">A fellow pass by and he says: You want a lift home?</span> <span id="s131">And I was sitting on the bicycle, the Chandles (ck) come, they saw us on the bicycle.</span> <span id="s132">We both spend the night in jail because we rode the bicycle.</span> <span id="s133">Whatever we did we didn't even know, because there was no radios.</span> <span id="s134">There was no newspapers.</span> <span id="s135">Nothing.</span> <span id="s136">Everything was forbidden.</span> <span id="s137">Not only for the Jews, for the public.</span> <span id="s138">The news there was like this: One guy went on the drum and announced this time everybody has to take the cows out, or things, because they're coming to take for the Army whatever they want.</span> <span id="s139">So we had buffaloes.</span> <span id="s140">Trained -- you know, trained buffaloes that the milk was very, very good from them.</span> <span id="s141">And I used to do black market.</span> <span id="s142">I used to take them everything from eggs, sugar, zachery (ck), anything that you could normally disguise by wood by the carriages.</span> <span id="s143">They used to buy us things to make the matzos.</span> <span id="s144">For Pesach -- from Purim to Pesach, they used to bake in our large room that they used -- lunch for where my father made.</span> <span id="s145">We'd make matzos for the whole town.</span> <span id="s146">Everything was available for money that we made from the black market.</span> <span id="s147">So I befriended myself with the head of the police station.</span> <span id="s148">And in order for me to be able to do that, I used to give him percentage.</span> <span id="s149">He used to get milk, eggs, chickens.</span> <span id="s150">Anything that I dealed with, he used to get.</span> <span id="s151">We become very good friends.</span> <span id="s152">As a matter of fact, before the ghetto, he told me: Look, the situation is getting very bad.</span> <span id="s153">You leave.</span> <span id="s154">I went home, and I told them the story.</span> <span id="s155">Nobody wanted to believe me.</span> <span id="s156">They said: How in the world can you say?</span> <span id="s157">We were comfortable just like here.</span> <span id="s158">We work.</span> <span id="s159">We gather money that somebody's going to come and take you away.</span> <span id="s160">Nobody wanted to believe it.</span> <span id="s161">I said: Look, remember when it was forbidden to kill for kosher, only once a week.</span> <span id="s162">And my uncle, my mother's brother was a butcher, and they caught him killing for -- slaughtering the meat for kosher in a different day.</span> <span id="s163">So the Rabbi that slaughter it and my uncle was arrested.</span> <span id="s164">So I went to the captain, my friend, and they got off from jail.</span> <span id="s165">I said: Look, remember when I got them off from jail, because he knows me, he told me -- he done favors for me, because I do favors for him.</span> <span id="s166">Whatever I give him, I didn't take any money, because if I would have take the black market money, I would have been arrested.</span> <span id="s167">And for the money that I give it to him, it didn't pay, because it's like for five dollars to five cents, so I figure it's better I give him a gift than to charge him.</span> <span id="s168">So, Friday before the ghetto started, he told me: Look, you are 40 miles from the border.</span> <span id="s169">Go home and tell your parents to pack and leave.</span> <span id="s170">Well, Friday I go home and I said to my mother and father: Look, the friend of mine, the captain says: The situation is very bad and it's getting worse.</span> <span id="s171">One, we have a chance.</span> <span id="s172">We should go over 40 miles to the border.</span> <span id="s173">My father had two brothers that lived in Romania, because when we were there it was Hungary; and he had a sister in Bucharest.</span> <span id="s174">He said: Take whatever you can and leave.</span> <span id="s175">When I went home and I told -- my mother and my father, they went to Synagogue Friday night and Saturday, and they discussed it.</span> <span id="s176">Well, they said: Now I think she is going too far.</span> <span id="s177">I know she has connections.</span> <span id="s178">I know she took us out of jail.</span> <span id="s179">I know that whatever she is planning she could do, and he goes along with her, but this is a little too far.</span> <span id="s180">You see, when he said that, everybody was staying put.</span> <span id="s181">The Rabbi said, the shucta (ck) said to stay put.</span> <span id="s182">So it came Tuesday morning, when we started to bring people from -- for the towns.</span> <span id="s183">We were only three and a half miles to the city, kilometers.</span> <span id="s184">We walked.</span> <span id="s185">The other people, that they were further, the Chandles (ck) used to take them in little carriages and take families.</span> <span id="s186">So I said to my mother Tuesday morning, I say: You see, you didn't believe me.</span> <span id="s187">You see already they are taking these people.</span> <span id="s188">So my mother used to say: Well, they were business people.</span> <span id="s189">Maybe they did something wrong and they caught them, and they're taking them for questioning.</span> <span id="s190">I didn't want do Tuesday morning nothing, no chores around the house, because we had to feed the ducks, the chickens, the cows.</span> <span id="s191">Everything everybody had -- you know, when you were a large family, everybody had the chores before they go any place.</span> <span id="s192">I says: I'm not doing nothing.</span> <span id="s193">I said: You wait and you will see what's going to happen here.</span> <span id="s194">So finally they knock on the door and they say, you have five minutes to get whatever you want.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Give me your jewelry and give me your money, and be ready in five minutes.</span> <span id="s196">We -- my mother at that time looked at me, and I didn't say nothing.</span> <span id="s197">So we packed little things that you take: A blanket, a pot, a milchig pot, a fleishig pot.</span> <span id="s198">And my father was doing the horses, too, for the Germans, because we had two Germans that lived in our house.</span> <span id="s199">Two officers lived in our house.</span> <span id="s200">It was even -- if we had only five rooms, it was still the biggest house in the area.</span> <span id="s201">So whenever an officer came, they used to say -- there was no hotels -- your master bedroom was taken.</span> <span id="s202">My mother and father had to get out of the bedroom, and they were there for a month, living there because they had maneuvers.</span> <span id="s203">This was German people, officers.</span> <span id="s204">They were very polite.</span> <span id="s205">They were staying in our house.</span> <span id="s206">My father was taking care of the horses, and they used to like our cooking.</span> <span id="s207">My mother used to cook them breakfast and everything, and they used to pay us for it, and they enjoyed the home cooking.</span> <span id="s208">They never said anything.</span> <span id="s209">My father, they were waiting until he finished the horses, to shoe the horses, and then they gathered us in one big, in a big garden.</span> <span id="s210">And they said when they gathered the whole group we start marching to the ghetto, which was approximately four and a half miles.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: Could we go back?</span> <span id="s212">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s213">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: You are 12 or 13 years old and the Hungarians take -- A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: -- how do you begin to think about black market?</span> <span id="s216">You were a very young person.</span> <span id="s217">Were you with a group of young people who did the same thing?</span> <span id="s218">Where did this come to your head to do this?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: Well, my father didn't speak Romanian.</span> <span id="s220">My mother was able to speak Romanian and Hungarian.</span> <span id="s221">My mother was a very shy person and very frightened person.</span> <span id="s222">She was practically afraid of her shadow.</span> <span id="s223">The law had to be obeyed just the way it is.</span> <span id="s224">I was always rebellious.</span> <span id="s225">I was determined to rebellion.</span> <span id="s226">Nobody is going to tell me what to do.</span> <span id="s227">So after I went to school -- when I went to school, towards the end, like when I went to the second grade, then already -- every year I was the first in the class.</span> <span id="s228">And there was always when the graduation came they used to give us a bouquet of flowers, a basket of fruit.</span> <span id="s229">All the time I got a crown, a basket of fruit, and a bouquet of flowers from the captain that lived in our town, because I was a good student.</span> <span id="s230">I also went, when it came towards the end in Romania, when I was about nine years old, I was -- the teacher -- we had a big classroom.</span> <span id="s231">The whole time had two-room school.</span> <span id="s232">In one school there were four grades, and in the other classroom there was the fifth, sixth and seventh; and they were only two teachers.</span> <span id="s233">If one teacher didn't come in, I used to take over the classroom.</span> <span id="s234">So I -- after I take over the classroom, I was the youngest in the group.</span> <span id="s235">But we were sitting like 400 children in one room.</span> <span id="s236">You could hear a pin dropping, and if anybody made a little noise, they were cornered -- in the corner, that they had to kneel in the corner, if they made noise, because she wanted attention.</span> <span id="s237">After then, when then they started to be the situation bad, that there was no more food -- if they called me to tutor somebody, I used to go home, they used to give me the milk, and the eggs.</span> <span id="s238">A basket of eggs.</span> <span id="s239">Anything.</span> <span id="s240">I used to get paid, but not in money, in food.</span> <span id="s241">When I went shopping, I was about nine years, I used to go shopping with my father in the city.</span> <span id="s242">The first time I went to the store, and I ordered something, they looked at me like crazy first.</span> <span id="s243">But then I went with my father and my father said: If she ordered anything, make sure it's just like I order it.</span> <span id="s244">So I still practically run anything in the house.</span> <span id="s245">So my mother was afraid, and my father didn't know the language.</span> <span id="s246">So I was part with him, and whatever he said, or I said, went.</span> <span id="s247">So when schooling it wasn't any more available for me, and I didn't like the trade too much.</span> <span id="s248">We had in the house everything, and we used to sell.</span> <span id="s249">We used to make the matzos from Purim to Pesach, for the whole city, the population for 8,000.</span> <span id="s250">They used to come 50, 60 girls in the morning, and they used to roll the matzos and bake it, and they used to make five kilo packages, and we went in to sell it for everybody, matzos.</span> <span id="s251">There was a point we used to make whiskey for sugaries (ck), and then we used to make the lentka (ck) and the castles (ck).</span> <span id="s252">We used to stay up all night and used to make the daluckavas (ck).</span> <span id="s253">Everything we had.</span> <span id="s254">We used to have the milk, and we used to sell.</span> <span id="s255">I went in to the city two, three times a day by foot, and I used to deliver the milk, and I used to sell everything before when it was still legal.</span> <span id="s256">Then after then when it was illegal, we had the three cows -- buffaloes.</span> <span id="s257">Then we went, they kept taking away.</span> <span id="s258">First thing, if the non-Jews had ten or 12, but if a Jew had three, the first one to be taken was from the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s259">At that time I was very outspoken, and I didn't know the translation from Hungarian to Romanian rather well.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">When a big officer used to pass by, my mother used to say: Here goes a "Hunt.</span> <span id="s261">A big hunt."</span> <span id="s262">(ck) A "hunt" is a dog.</span> <span id="s263">And translated in Hungarian was "cupyah."</span> <span id="s264">(ck) And I didn't know the difference between the real name of it or no.</span> <span id="s265">That is the way that this is the dog, so I called it a dog.</span> <span id="s266">So when they took away the first cow, I didn't say nothing.</span> <span id="s267">When they took away the second, I didn't say nothing.</span> <span id="s268">And finally it came that they took away the last one, and we used to take the milk for my friend, who used to love the milk, I went and I said to them: Gee, you're taking away the third one?</span> <span id="s269">This is the last one we have.</span> <span id="s270">I says: You know something, I know a bigger dog than you.</span> <span id="s271">Not knowing that I say anything wrong, they called -- my mother used to say a "cupyahbuctka" that he is a big officer, but they used to call them the big dogs passing by, and also I know a bigger dog than you.</span> <span id="s272">I went home my mother was crying and my father was crying.</span> <span id="s273">I said, "What happened?"</span> <span id="s274">I say: You know something, I don't care they took -- they take away your last cow, but you know what you just said.</span> <span id="s275">You called them a dog, and you say you know a bigger dog than him.</span> <span id="s276">I went in to the city and I told my friend.</span> <span id="s277">I said: Look what happened.</span> <span id="s278">This was in 1943.</span> <span id="s279">I said: Look what happened, and this was the last one that we had.</span> <span id="s280">And I said to him: I know a bigger dog than you, and I meant you.</span> <span id="s281">I says I really didn't know what I was saying, and he was laughing.</span> <span id="s282">He gave me a slip and he said, just go back with the slip there and they will not take your last one away.</span> <span id="s283">And don't worry, nothing is going to happen to you.</span> <span id="s284">All this happened before the ghetto.</span> <span id="s285">I went in a couple of times.</span> <span id="s286">I used to take him the eggs and the milk bottles, and the milk things that are the rather big things for the milk to carry, oil, everything -- and I used to take it.</span> <span id="s287">And whenever we used to kill ducks or -- they didn't come out kosher, that was his gift.</span> <span id="s288">He didn't know they not kosher.</span> <span id="s289">But he -- they were -- just that -- because they didn't come out kosher, they were his.</span> <span id="s290">He used to like the ducks and the goose, because in Europe they used to have stuff, good stuff.</span> <span id="s291">My brother was very religious, and he didn't eat from the same dishes.</span> <span id="s292">We at home have two sets of dishes.</span> <span id="s293">For us we have white (ck) kosher, and my brother was glat.</span> <span id="s294">He was a Rabbi.</span> <span id="s295">When he came to town, he didn't eat the same killings from our Rabbi, because he was a little older, and he says maybe his hand shake.</span> <span id="s296">So he brings his own haliff (ck) to cut his own killing, and my mother, should rest in peace, used to cook him special dishes.</span> <span id="s297">He got married when he was 20 years old without even seeing his bride.</span> <span id="s298">He just know whose Rabbi's granddaughter he was getting, and that was sufficient for him.</span> <span id="s299">When my father -- when he came home from Yeshiva and he says: I'm getting married.</span> <span id="s300">My father was surprised, because he went to an all-boy Yeshiva.</span> <span id="s301">He comes, he says -- my father: Yeah, you're getting married.</span> <span id="s302">Who's the girl?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">He says: This Rabbi's and Rabbi's granddaugher.</span> <span id="s304">My father looked at him amazed, then there was a wedding.</span> <span id="s305">He got married without even -- they went for the engagement.</span> <span id="s306">That's the first time my mother saw the girl and my father, who was about 70, 80 kilometers from the house.</span> <span id="s307">But in Europe 70, 80 kilometers was like from here -- it was far away.</span> <span id="s308">I never went there because there was no cars.</span> <span id="s309">You know, you practically had to walk if you went from one place to another.</span> <span id="s310">They went to the engagement, and they did get married.</span> <span id="s311">My sister-in-law was so religious.</span> <span id="s312">She was so religious that she didn't even wear a sheitel.</span> <span id="s313">She wore a spietsel (ck), they called it in Europe.</span> <span id="s314">It was made out of satin.</span> <span id="s315">Not hair.</span> <span id="s316">And my brother, he wear a shtreimel and a cafftan (ck), and white socks.</span> <span id="s317">And he was very, very fromm (ck).</span> <span id="s318">When he was called in 1940 in the Army, when they took him there, he did -- he lived -- finally when they killed him just before the liberation -- on bread and water for four years.</span> <span id="s319">So when I went to -- when this fellow, my friend told us to leave, then nobody believed me.</span> <span id="s320">Nobody wanted to believe me what's happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: Did you think about leaving by yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s323">I was thinking about leaving myself many times.</span> <span id="s324">He came -- see, when we were in the ghetto, they took us to the ghetto that day, and before that we were entered, there was a girl by the name of Atteckata (ck) was her name.</span> <span id="s325">And she looked at us -- she took my mother's sheitel to see what's she's carrying, she took the sheitel.</span> <span id="s326">She was looking every - - in your private parts to see if you don't carry gold with you.</span> <span id="s327">But even that time I had in my shoulder pads stuffed with money that I took all the way to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s328">I did want to go, leave many times.</span> <span id="s329">And the ghetto, my friend took us out.</span> <span id="s330">They had -- he used to come and he used to say: It's night already.</span> <span id="s331">At night, close the lamps.</span> <span id="s332">We had the loose turn (ck) lamps.</span> <span id="s333">In the ghetto there was no bungalows or anything.</span> <span id="s334">We just made sukkos.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Everybody had a little sukkoh.</span> <span id="s336">From floor blankets, and that's how they slept.</span> <span id="s337">The children were crying.</span> <span id="s338">There was 8,000 people outdoors in the woods.</span> <span id="s339">There was no barracks.</span> <span id="s340">Nothing.</span> <span id="s341">Even from there they used to take every day the people, and they used to torture them.</span> <span id="s342">There was one house that the officer lived, and they used to torture them to find out where they left the money behind, where they buried the jewelry and where is the money.</span> <span id="s343">That's what they were looking is for money and jewelry.</span> <span id="s344">And everybody practically -- even my father -- they brought them back on stretcher.</span> <span id="s345">That is how they tortured them before they took us to the Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: Were you tortured?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: I wasn't tortured in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s348">But in the ghetto there were -- the Hungarian people used to take the Jewish people for maids or for labor, because all the Jewish people were pretty well off.</span> <span id="s349">Most of them -- either they were in business, either they were mechanics or all of them made better money than the Christians, and they all had maids.</span> <span id="s350">But when it came -- when they pulled together the peoples, they took out the doctors and the lawyers.</span> <span id="s351">And the children, the babies born in the hospital, brand new babies, all of them ended up outdoor.</span> <span id="s352">It was in May, right before Shavuos.</span> <span id="s353">And we were in ghetto there in open air with the rain, with everything for a whole month.</span> <span id="s354">Every day they used to go a truckload in with girls to the city to be maids.</span> <span id="s355">So my friend had requested me for a maid.</span> <span id="s356">Every day I went out, and I never worked.</span> <span id="s357">I -- he had a daughter the same age of mine.</span> <span id="s358">And we used to play around there and kibitz and one back -- and he always give me to take something back, bread or anything to take back to the camp.</span> <span id="s359">He says: Look, I told you to leave.</span> <span id="s360">You didn't listen.</span> <span id="s361">Even now if you want to, I could get a truckload, 40 people, and I will take you over the border.</span> <span id="s362">So, I went back and my mother start counting.</span> <span id="s363">We are 10.</span> <span id="s364">My brother is so many, and the other ones, who should we leave behind?</span> <span id="s365">Let's go.</span> <span id="s366">Whoever is going to be, let's go.</span> <span id="s367">I had a little brother.</span> <span id="s368">The youngest one was three years old, and he was crying so much.</span> <span id="s369">And I knew my area, and I know the mountains, because if you lived in the town, we were three miles away, but my grandmother lived 12 miles away, and I used to walk from one place to another one.</span> <span id="s370">And my father had a lot of customers up in the mountains.</span> <span id="s371">So I said to my mother: Look, Welby (ck) -- he was the youngest -- he's crying so much.</span> <span id="s372">I'm going to take him and leave.</span> <span id="s373">And some days when you come back, we'll get together again.</span> <span id="s374">First of all, she said no.</span> <span id="s375">Then she said: Do what you want.</span> <span id="s376">Then the next day there was an appeal and everybody was outside.</span> <span id="s377">They were counting and they were talking, and they were saying: Look, the groups are starting to leave.</span> <span id="s378">The first group will leave tomorrow, and they give the names which group will leave from what area -- they announced the names, because there were 8,000, and they only used to go like 2,000 to 2,500 to one group.</span> <span id="s379">He says we're starting now with 2,500, and this and this group to leave.</span> <span id="s380">And the Rabbi -- we had a Rabbi.</span> <span id="s381">Even a priest was in our ghetto.</span> <span id="s382">His grandmother was Jewish.</span> <span id="s383">He never knew it, because they -- he was going by a different name, and he didn't know it that his grandmother was Jewish, and he was with the priestly clothes, taken out from the church, and he was in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s384">The Rabbi -- one Rabbi -- our Rabbi's name was Ponit, and there was another Ponit who was from Enombert (ck).</span> <span id="s385">He was about 40, 50 kilometers from -- 14 or 15 kilometers from our city, from our town.</span> <span id="s386">So he made an appeal, and he says: Please don't leave.</span> <span id="s387">There was no wires around.</span> <span id="s388">So a couple people maybe sneaked out.</span> <span id="s389">And then he says: If you going to leave, the ones who will be behind will suffer.</span> <span id="s390">And that day I want to leave, and my mother says: Do you hear what the Rabbi said?</span> <span id="s391">So on that night, believe it or not, this Rabbi with 11 children got the pass for the children, get dressed as Austrians, and they left, leaving the whole other Rabbi -- the Rabbi from Dashe (ck) came with the group.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">The other Rabbi with the children disappeared that night, and he went over the border.</span> <span id="s393">After when we went to Auschwitz, which we were the last transport, they put us on the cattle trains, and then we went away to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s394">We traveled approximately four and a half or five and a half days.</span> <span id="s395">It seemed like a year, because we were about 70 to 80 people in one car -- from it.</span> <span id="s396">It stopped once or twice a day for people to go down do the bathroom.</span> <span id="s397">And the children, we had a pot that we were cooking, that is what they used for a bathroom.</span> <span id="s398">Food, they used to throw in -- if you were 70 people, they throw in 70 pieces of bread, and that was your meals all the way when we got to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: Can we go back, Bella?</span> <span id="s400">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: When you went to see this captain and he took you out and you played with his daughter, he gave you food to bring back?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: He gave me food to bring for my family.</span> <span id="s403">He also used to come and used to drop the bread in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: Why do you think he was doing this?</span> <span id="s405">Was this not taking risk?</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: For me to take him the stuff that I take him was taking a risk.</span> <span id="s407">For me, for doing the black market that he knows I was doing -- whenever somebody else called me, I said this is for him, and he knew after I left, I left him something, and I delivered it to my customers.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: So he wasn't taking a chance?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: He trusted me and I trusted him.</span> <span id="s410">So when he told me to leave, I trusted him; but unfortunately when I went home, nobody wanted to believe me.</span> <span id="s411">Now, I was only 15 years old, and then you come home -- it's just like here.</span> <span id="s412">Somebody would come and tell you: Gee, you'd better pack, because tomorrow they're going to ring your bell and take you away.</span> <span id="s413">And nobody would believe it.</span> <span id="s414">But believe me, the situation here is getting to be almost, almost -- you know, sometimes I get the chills when I see the news here.</span> <span id="s415">I see a swastika here, and that they did this and they did that.</span> <span id="s416">It's getting -- this is the way it started in Europe.</span> <span id="s417">Exactly the same way.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: What did you know about what was going on in Germany and Poland before you went into the ghetto in 1943?</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: Nothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: Nothing.</span> <span id="s422">There was no news.</span> <span id="s423">The radio was for the -- my aunt used to have a -- we didn't have electricity in our house, and we didn't have the water coming into our house.</span> <span id="s424">We had lamps.</span> <span id="s425">Lit (ck) the city and just before us, but everything went on batteries.</span> <span id="s426">It was forbidden to use a radio.</span> <span id="s427">If you had radio, first of all, it was taken from the government.</span> <span id="s428">Secondly, everything was announced to them.</span> <span id="s429">A bicycle, you're supposed to register.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Like I said, two of us rode a bicycle, because it was registered.</span> <span id="s431">I ended up in jail.</span> <span id="s432">Now there was no news.</span> <span id="s433">Nobody knew absolutely nothing.</span> <span id="s434">When the officer told me that -- when my friend told me, and he was the captain of the police station from the town, from the city, when he told me that, nobody wanted to believe it.</span> <span id="s435">It's like in here.</span> <span id="s436">If somebody would say, you are comfortable in your house, they're going to knock on your door, they're going to take you away.</span> <span id="s437">They don't want to believe it.</span> <span id="s438">Everybody trying to lock up when we left.</span> <span id="s439">We figure, gee, when you come back, you'll find everything, because we didn't know where they'd take us.</span> <span id="s440">They said, five minutes, get ready you leave.</span> <span id="s441">We didn't know where and why.</span> <span id="s442">And nobody was able to question.</span> <span id="s443">They had the guns.</span> <span id="s444">They came home with guns, and what are you going to say to somebody that comes home with a gun, and they say: We are authorized to take you away.</span> <span id="s445">Nobody knew where.</span> <span id="s446">So the first thing where they took us was in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s447">And in the ghetto we were there approximately four weeks, three and a half to four weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: How did other people get food in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: In the ghetto they give you -- it was rationed.</span> <span id="s450">Everybody we used to get, every day we used to go and you used to get so much beets, so much this and that.</span> <span id="s451">And they used to make from the wood.</span> <span id="s452">You take the wood and you made a fire, and you used to cook.</span> <span id="s453">This is the way.</span> <span id="s454">You had bread.</span> <span id="s455">There was no facility.</span> <span id="s456">There was no bathrooms.</span> <span id="s457">It was the woods.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: So what happened?</span> <span id="s459">Did you go to the woods --</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: To the woods.</span> <span id="s461">They took a shovel and they dug a place, and they put the tree across, and one side was for the women and the other side was for the men.</span> <span id="s462">Everything was wild in the woods.</span> <span id="s463">There was no water flowing, and there was no nothing.</span> <span id="s464">There was no electrical lights or anything.</span> <span id="s465">There was, like we go -- people go here camping.</span> <span id="s466">It was surrounded with police around, but no wires.</span> <span id="s467">There was no wire fence.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: Were you frightened?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: I wasn't frightened.</span> <span id="s470">I was only very, very depressed because I used to say: Gee, I knew about it when we could have take advantage, and even, you know, you never know what happens to the rest.</span> <span id="s471">But we had a chance of leaving, and they didn't listen, so there was nothing that -- once you were already there, there was nothing what you could have done any more.</span> <span id="s472">If you went into the city, they took you to the city.</span> <span id="s473">Everybody came in the morning.</span> <span id="s474">They picked you up for work.</span> <span id="s475">There was somebody waiting, and a certain time of the day they brought you back.</span> <span id="s476">Then you went back to camp and everybody was sleeping on the floors.</span> <span id="s477">So we had a space maybe five by 20, or five by 18, or a little place that you put like a sukkoh, and you put blankets all around, and you were sleeping on the floor, the whole family.</span> <span id="s478">And like this, you could have seen every family.</span> <span id="s479">You went from one place to the other one, and there was 8,000 people there in the woods.</span> <span id="s480">In the middle of nowhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: You weren't afraid.</span> <span id="s482">Did you experience other people being afraid or apprehensive?</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: There were many people who died, right in there.</span> <span id="s484">There were children that died.</span> <span id="s485">There were old people.</span> <span id="s486">There was doctors, but they was no medicine.</span> <span id="s487">There were doctors taken from the hospital that they done surgery, and there were people that they brought them with the ambulance, and they dropped them off in the woods, because they just delivered, new babies and everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: So this went on for a month?</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: This went on for just about a month, because we left in the last transport that went to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s490">When we arrived in Auschwitz --</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: Tell me what one thing.</span> <span id="s492">Were you in the same cattle car with your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s494">When we arrived in Auschwitz as we went down, there was music playing in the park.</span> <span id="s495">They had two or three people on violin playing.</span> <span id="s496">And as we walked down from the wagons, there was -- he was pointing out right and left, right and left.</span> <span id="s497">And I was going with my mother and with my other children.</span> <span id="s498">And then there was Polish people who were there from before, because we were only there from 1944.</span> <span id="s499">But there were many people who were there from '39, '40.</span> <span id="s500">So one person walks over to me and asks me: How old are you?</span> <span id="s501">Because I had already a towel to go with my mother.</span> <span id="s502">They said they were going to take showers.</span> <span id="s503">So I said I was 15.</span> <span id="s504">So he took the towel away from me, and he watched, and nobody said, and he pushed me the other side.</span> <span id="s505">And he says: Say you are 16.</span> <span id="s506">From now on, you are 16 not 15.</span> <span id="s507">So I went on the other side, and they asked me how old you are, and I said 16.</span> <span id="s508">They shaved my hair.</span> <span id="s509">They gave me an injection, and they give me the dress, a towel and a blanket.</span> <span id="s510">And from there we went to a barrack.</span> <span id="s511">It was a long barrack.</span> <span id="s512">There must have been there a couple hundred people, because there was no beds.</span> <span id="s513">It was an empty barrack.</span> <span id="s514">And we were sitting, and one sitting the other one slept.</span> <span id="s515">That's how crowded it was.</span> <span id="s516">Just like you pack one on top of the other one.</span> <span id="s517">Nobody recognized anybody by the hair.</span> <span id="s518">We were all shaved and everything.</span> <span id="s519">And then as we were talking, they said: From where are you?</span> <span id="s520">Because the trains come in constantly, and there were people not from our ghetto alone and everything got mixed up.</span> <span id="s521">So when I was talking, I say: Gee, somebody there said she is from the same place.</span> <span id="s522">This is the way about talking, it took us four days until I find two more sister in the same barrack.</span> <span id="s523">That we were in the same barrack, and two cousins.</span> <span id="s524">And then we stuck together.</span> <span id="s525">We tried to stuck together, the five of us.</span> <span id="s526">Whenever we went, they counted us.</span> <span id="s527">We were together.</span> <span id="s528">So they were in that barrack in the Saylogger (ck) for a week and a half or so.</span> <span id="s529">Every morning they used to take us out, count us.</span> <span id="s530">We had breakfast, black coffee and a piece of bread, and sent back to the barrack.</span> <span id="s531">And then later --</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: Were you registered in any way?</span> <span id="s533">You got a number?</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s535">88,800 -- either 72 or 27.</span> <span id="s536">The last two number, I don't remember.</span> <span id="s537">It was a 27 or 72.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">It was written out on our chests, on the dress.</span> <span id="s539">It was not -- it was printed.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: Not a tattoo?</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: No, not a tattoo.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: Was there any insignia besides the number?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: No, only numbers.</span> <span id="s544">It was gray with white stripe dresses.</span> <span id="s545">Everybody was the same thing, the dress.</span> <span id="s546">The only thing they let you keep from hope was the shoes.</span> <span id="s547">And from there, after about a couple of days, they start picking and they send out to Kaiservalt (ck).</span> <span id="s548">And Kaiservalt --</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: Let me ask you a little bit about Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s550">What did you see when you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Were you mainly in the barrack?</span> <span id="s552">Were you working at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: No, we weren't working.</span> <span id="s554">We were mainly in the barrack.</span> <span id="s555">When it came -- we were looking at each other.</span> <span id="s556">We were just had the welcome to an end.</span> <span id="s557">That everything was bezerk already.</span> <span id="s558">That we only had that tank.</span> <span id="s559">There was a barrack, it was covered.</span> <span id="s560">If it was raining, we were inside.</span> <span id="s561">There was a bathroom, but you couldn't get out to it, because you were sitting in each other's lap, and it would take you half an hour to get through everybody just to pass to go to a bathroom.</span> <span id="s562">So I said, don't worry, you don't have to go so often, you don't drink and you don't eat.</span> <span id="s563">So I said: Look on the bright side.</span> <span id="s564">You don't have to use the bathroom so often.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: Did you ask about your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: No, there was nobody to ask.</span> <span id="s567">There was no -- nobody to ask, and there were many shootings.</span> <span id="s568">And they used to count to ten.</span> <span id="s569">And they used to take the tenth one with no question at all, and they used to shoot.</span> <span id="s570">In front of us you could see shootings.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: You saw that?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: You saw that, yes.</span> <span id="s573">Then they took us to Kaiservalt (ck).</span> <span id="s574">And from Kaiservalt they took two boats, and they put is in two boats.</span> <span id="s575">And the first boat in front of us we saw it sank, because it was one boat after another.</span> <span id="s576">Maybe it was 100 or 300 feet away.</span> <span id="s577">So I don't know if there was anything wrong with the boat that it sank by itself, or was it prepared to sink?</span> <span id="s578">That I didn't know.</span> <span id="s579">In Reichau (ck), when we arrived the first time, we worked in a jelly company.</span> <span id="s580">We were filling in the bottles, the jam and jelly, and all different kind of things.</span> <span id="s581">We worked from the morning until late in the night.</span> <span id="s582">In the morning we had black coffee, and then lunch we had bread, because we saved it for lunch, and at night there was soup.</span> <span id="s583">I don't know what they have in the soup.</span> <span id="s584">I don't know what the injections I got.</span> <span id="s585">But the whole time that we were there, no girl ever got the period.</span> <span id="s586">I don't know if anybody told you that before.</span> <span id="s587">So after we were there for a while, then they took us to Steuthauf (ck).</span> <span id="s588">They de-liced (ck) us there, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: How long were you in the Reichau (ck)?</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: In Reichau, about a week and a half, two weeks.</span> <span id="s591">We were a little -- we were in Auschwitz also about a couple of days, and then we were in Kaiservalt (ck) and then in Reichau (ck).</span> <span id="s592">From Reichau we went to Steuthauf (ck).</span> <span id="s593">In Steuthauf we were there a week.</span> <span id="s594">There we got bunks, bunk beds.</span> <span id="s595">And there were fences every block was long.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">There were a couple hundred girls in it, and there were fences.</span> <span id="s597">But the fences were so that you were able to talk from one fence to the fence, or you could go through the wires if you were very careful.</span> <span id="s598">There we met somebody who says I have a sister in our bank, and we had to find -- a fourth sister, on the other side of the bank, because she came from a different place.</span> <span id="s599">She was living with her grandmother, taking care of her grandmother, and she was in a different ghetto.</span> <span id="s600">And then we started talking through the fence.</span> <span id="s601">And this girl says: Look, you are three there.</span> <span id="s602">I am here alone and my sister is there.</span> <span id="s603">How about changing clothes, I said.</span> <span id="s604">You take my sister dress because of the number, and she'll take your dress and come through the wires and switch.</span> <span id="s605">So we did that.</span> <span id="s606">We changed the clothes, and my sister came over and she was that number.</span> <span id="s607">There was no names.</span> <span id="s608">Nobody knew your name.</span> <span id="s609">They only knew you by number.</span> <span id="s610">So this way we were together.</span> <span id="s611">And from there, from Steuthauf (ck), they took us to labor camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: How many were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: Now we were four sisters together.</span> <span id="s614">See, we were three kinds of children, as I mentioned to you: Mines, yours and ours.</span> <span id="s615">So this friend of my father's side, five children survived out of six.</span> <span id="s616">On my mother's side, the first one never came back, and from the five I have one sister that is left.</span> <span id="s617">My mother was -- my youngest sister and the two brothers and my father went straight to the crematoriums supposedly the day they arrived.</span> <span id="s618">So we were going -- and from there they took us -- from Steuthauf (ck) they took us to Goodhauf (ck).</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: What did do you in Steuthauf?</span> <span id="s620">A: Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: Nothing.</span> <span id="s622">A. Nothing.</span> <span id="s623">There -- because we were only there like de-liced, and appeals, and they picked who goes where.</span> <span id="s624">Then when we went -- from there they took us, we make the trenches.</span> <span id="s625">There they took us to Goodhauf (ck), and Goodhauf (ck) there was -- it was already October or so, and that was in Estonia.</span> <span id="s626">We lived outdoor in tents.</span> <span id="s627">There were ten people to a tent, and there was only a farm house.</span> <span id="s628">And in the farm house they had like a hospital made supposedly for anybody that gets sick and for the officers, and the kitchen was there, which they cooked for once a time.</span> <span id="s629">In the morning we used to go with the shovels and the picks to go to make the trenches.</span> <span id="s630">We used to march about two, three miles before we started working, and then they measured the space you have to make for today.</span> <span id="s631">Like they said, so many people, and we used to dig out the dirt and throw it up, and it has to be six and a half feet deep.</span> <span id="s632">We did the trenches.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q: With shovels?</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A: With shovels and picks.</span> <span id="s635">Then it started to snow.</span> <span id="s636">Very early in that area it started to snow.</span> <span id="s637">When we came home from the work, we used to take the bodies, anybody who died, and we used to go dig in the ground, but I don't think we dig two feet to bury people.</span> <span id="s638">When we buried the people, the very first thing we did was take off the shoes, because if anybody shoes disappear, they used to take you away and you never see them again.</span> <span id="s639">They say they take you for shoes, but you never got back again.</span> <span id="s640">So you used to always have the reserve shoes.</span> <span id="s641">Whoever died, the shoes were taken away.</span> <span id="s642">After we buried the people, the shoes we took off.</span> <span id="s643">So my sister lost her shoes -- tore.</span> <span id="s644">My one sister that is in Israel, and her foot was a number -- a seven.</span> <span id="s645">Mine was a six, and my other sister was a six.</span> <span id="s646">But I had my sister that passed away in Israel, she always like bigger shoes.</span> <span id="s647">So she bought a seven instead of a six before she left.</span> <span id="s648">So I threw it on the floor and I took off her shoes.</span> <span id="s649">And I say: Now you have a choice.</span> <span id="s650">Either you take my shoes, either the shoes that I took off from her, because they are both sixes.</span> <span id="s651">No, she wants hers.</span> <span id="s652">And I says: But I can't cut off her feet to give her a six.</span> <span id="s653">I say: I have no choice.</span> <span id="s654">I said: Either you take mine or you take the other shoes that I took off from the dead person.</span> <span id="s655">But I took off her shoes.</span> <span id="s656">I throw it on the floor, and I gave it to my sister, because I figure if they take her away, we'll never see her again.</span> <span id="s657">So we worked -- and there and then -- and then when the war got closer, then it became to that extent that they took us in the front where we carried the ammunition from the train to a place, and then from the place we used to hand them over to shoot.</span> <span id="s658">We were right in the front, giving the soldiers, the Germans, the ammunition.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">We used to carry the tins -- by the boxes, which they were heavy than -- we used to drag them, and we used to take the ammunitions for them.</span> <span id="s660">That was already at the end of November, December, and the beginning of January.</span> <span id="s661">So at that time already we were followed, wherever they went, we went with them.</span> <span id="s662">We didn't stay in one place, because we went from Goodhauf (ck), we went the next town, and we didn't follow up the towns because there was -- first of all, we didn't know.</span> <span id="s663">Sometimes we didn't even know what day of the week it was.</span> <span id="s664">But we do know when Yom Kippur was, because there was a guard who said that this is Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s665">And I said: Well, what's the big deal.</span> <span id="s666">All we missing is the black coffee, and we didn't eat.</span> <span id="s667">We going to take off for black coffee.</span> <span id="s668">I didn't -- we didn't have nothing.</span> <span id="s669">And the guard was a Saxon, also speak Romania language.</span> <span id="s670">Some of them were pretty good, the guards.</span> <span id="s671">But occasionally they would throw you a piece of bread, and nobody saw it.</span> <span id="s672">They were afraid for themselves.</span> <span id="s673">So he says: You mean you want to still believe in God after what they did to you?</span> <span id="s674">So I says: Well, what did I miss, black coffee.</span> <span id="s675">So I have less of a stomachache.</span> <span id="s676">Much more I can't miss because they don't give you enough food.</span> <span id="s677">We ate raw potatoes if we find them on the floor, or sugar beets was a treat.</span> <span id="s678">If we pass by the farms and we saw sugar beets and we take them out of the mud, that was another something to eat.</span> <span id="s679">We were working then -- after we finished in that area and we went in the farm, and we were doing the ammunition, they used to go in the trains with ammunitions through the night, and we worked all day.</span> <span id="s680">At night they used to come in, they used to come -- we had no hours like from 9:00 to 5:00, so we went by the door.</span> <span id="s681">We were sitting by the door and falling asleep right next to the door.</span> <span id="s682">We figure there is more air near the door.</span> <span id="s683">We left everybody going in and we were by the door.</span> <span id="s684">The train came in the night, and they came.</span> <span id="s685">They grabbed whoever was by the door, they grabbed us.</span> <span id="s686">So we went to work at night shift barracks -- sleeping -- we went at night work to take off the ammunition from the train.</span> <span id="s687">The second night it was the same thing again.</span> <span id="s688">So we said: Hey, it's no good to stay near the door.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Let's go further in.</span> <span id="s690">So the third night they said, twice I took from near the door, now they took us the third time, because they say now he's changing.</span> <span id="s691">He went for the other one.</span> <span id="s692">You could say, we were by the door.</span> <span id="s693">There was nothing to it.</span> <span id="s694">We worked three days, three nights without sleep, and only with the black coffee, the piece of bread, and at night we had soup.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: How did you do it?</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A: Would you believe me, many times I think, and I say: Is it possible to go through this?</span> <span id="s697">If I wouldn't have lived it, and somebody would have tell me, I would say: Impossible.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Because you're a hike (ck), because you can't understand how much a person could go through in life without -- like I say, you are strong as a horse and as weak as a leaf, because many times when they were killing somebody, you would say: Gee, I wish it was me already.</span> <span id="s699">You didn't even care anymore.</span> <span id="s700">You really didn't care if they killed you or whatever.</span> <span id="s701">But I said, if they kill you, I wouldn't mind to be shot.</span> <span id="s702">If a girl went out of the line one day, and they punished her -- so there was water poured on her in front of us until she froze to death.</span> <span id="s703">They were putting water in the winter on her.</span> <span id="s704">Then she collapsed.</span> <span id="s705">Then there was -- first she collapsed.</span> <span id="s706">Then they straightened her out.</span> <span id="s707">And they kept on pouring water on her as she was rolling, a piece of ice.</span> <span id="s708">So we buried her.</span> <span id="s709">After -- the next day was the funeral.</span> <span id="s710">So I said, that is a terrible death.</span> <span id="s711">If they want to do something, let them shoot me, but not that way.</span> <span id="s712">We were from Struehauf (ck) through the liberation we had no shower.</span> <span id="s713">We were once bathing in the nudist colony there on seven (ck) on the Baltic Sea where the S.S. said: Everybody take off their dress and go into the water.</span> <span id="s714">But when we came back, we put on the same clothes, and we had such lice like ants.</span> <span id="s715">As big as ants.</span> <span id="s716">I used to dig it with the nails to take out the lice out.</span> <span id="s717">That's how much lice you were.</span> <span id="s718">We were ten in a tent.</span> <span id="s719">You wouldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s720">One was not even Jewish.</span> <span id="s721">Her husband was Jewish, and she had a choice to leave or to not to go, because her grandmother and all of them were Hungarians, but they were officers in the Army, and she had a choice.</span> <span id="s722">They give her a choice.</span> <span id="s723">She says she wants to be with her family.</span> <span id="s724">She had a girl of 16, and she was pregnant when she came into the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s725">She didn't tell anybody she was pregnant, because they would have killed her immediately.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">She gave birth Christmas night in the tent, and that -- we took our towels and we wrapped the baby, and washed it with the coffee.</span> <span id="s727">She delivered the child right in the tent in front of us there.</span> <span id="s728">We were ten in a tent.</span> <span id="s729">And we give her the coffee to wash the baby, and the baby froze to death, and the next day we buried it.</span> <span id="s730">And all along she used to say: Jesus Christ, why did I come?</span> <span id="s731">Jesus Christ, why did I come?</span> <span id="s732">So I said: Jesus Christ wasn't for anybody, wouldn't help you now.</span> <span id="s733">You are here.</span> <span id="s734">I says: You know, unfortunately you can't save the baby.</span> <span id="s735">But I said: You save yourself.</span> <span id="s736">One day you are home from work, because the -- being that you are sick, they not going to think that you had a baby.</span> <span id="s737">They just put her down as sick for a day.</span> <span id="s738">The next day she went to work just like anybody else.</span> <span id="s739">They were all -- everybody that went to work, except if you were sick, they used to -- one day they used to give you permission to stay.</span> <span id="s740">But if you were sick more than one day, they used to take you away and you never came back.</span> <span id="s741">Just like anybody who didn't have shoes, or who was sick.</span> <span id="s742">You see them take you away in the truck and then -- you never know.</span> <span id="s743">They say they take you to another logger (ck).</span> <span id="s744">Never came back, and I don't know about the logger (ck) was, because they never came back to the town either.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: You were there three months or maybe we should just stop, and come back.</span> <span id="s746">I want to ask you about your sisters and other people's relationships with each other as well.</span> <span id="s747">Why don't we switch the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s749">TAPE #2</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q: You were together with two sisters and then with a third sister later.</span> <span id="s751">First in Auschwitz and later in --</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Q: What kinds of relationships did you see amongst the other women that you were with?</span> <span id="s754">The women, were they in little group just like you were with your sisters, or where there other people in your group?</span></p> <p><span id="s755">A: Everybody had their own group.</span> <span id="s756">You see, like when they were counting, when they came to count ten, and in Grouphau (ck) when we were in the place there, we were ten.</span> <span id="s757">So they counted tent.</span> <span id="s758">So we tried to be together.</span> <span id="s759">The sisters -- we were the four sisters together, and a cousin of my mother's daughter was there.</span> <span id="s760">A daughter of my mother's cousin who was by herself.</span> <span id="s761">She only had a brother who was very much involved with the Holocaust, also.</span> <span id="s762">He is a professor in City College in New York.</span> <span id="s763">But he's traveling for the Holocaust to Romania.</span> <span id="s764">He's gathering the papers together, Dr. Randall Braham (ck).</span> <span id="s765">And she was with us.</span> <span id="s766">A girl from our town that she didn't have any -- she had two brothers, that they never came back.</span> <span id="s767">And she cling to us because we was from the same town.</span> <span id="s768">And then the other people were -- like we were ten together.</span> <span id="s769">And you were ten together, you clicked together.</span> <span id="s770">When we got liberated, in it -- we was ten also in -- our area.</span> <span id="s771">Mostly 20 miles apart.</span> <span id="s772">One from each other.</span> <span id="s773">And in order to go together, we stick together.</span> <span id="s774">It was easier to go in group, because there was no bridges.</span> <span id="s775">And if you had to go from one town to the other one, you had to jump on ice, from one piece of ice to the other one in order to cross.</span> <span id="s776">Otherwise, you had to go around in circle.</span> <span id="s777">So I used to go and ask: "Posa ponia (ck), via stanzia a kilometer (ck) in Polish.</span> <span id="s778">That is all how much we knew Polish.</span> <span id="s779">To ask how far is the station.</span> <span id="s780">So they used to give us direction.</span> <span id="s781">Then we would jump at night and go, because then we got liberated in the camp, and we had no food, nothing.</span> <span id="s782">It was a barn, and they were a couple hundred, because people died out, and they took one group here and one group there.</span> <span id="s783">And we were on the front line, and over in the barn.</span> <span id="s784">And then the Russians came in, January 21st, then we stuck together, the ten girls.</span> <span id="s785">And the only one that died, that we are not in contact with is my sister who died last June; but there is one in Canada.</span> <span id="s786">There is four in Israel.</span> <span id="s787">One is in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s788">My sister lives home.</span> <span id="s789">One, the friend we just wanted to -- we just came from the trip, because she has a son who lives in Virginia, in Alexandria.</span> <span id="s790">But we stick together and we call each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q: How did you know that you were liberated?</span> <span id="s792">Well, what happened?</span> <span id="s793">You were going out every day and giving these --</span></p> <p><span id="s794">A: Every day we wake up in the morning, they used to call for appeal.</span> <span id="s795">Before we left for work, they used to count us.</span> <span id="s796">And then we went in groups marching to work, and that day nobody came.</span> <span id="s797">And so we were waiting and waiting outside, and there is nobody.</span> <span id="s798">So we looked around, and then one girl says: You know something, I don't think the S.S. are here anymore.</span> <span id="s799">So then everybody started to go and look for food.</span> <span id="s800">That was the first thing they were running for food.</span> <span id="s801">And then you could have said you got a chicken and just twisted their necks, and made a fire with the feathers and everything.</span> <span id="s802">And by the time I looked around, I saw a little pig running around.</span> <span id="s803">So I took my belt off, and the fork from the stable, and I put it into the pig, and potatoes, and we all sat down.</span> <span id="s804">There must have be about ten or 12 people, we sitting around and we had our fist meal, pig and baked potatoes -- with the skin and the guts and everything else.</span> <span id="s805">We just pulled it and it was ate.</span> <span id="s806">As a matter of fact, about five or six years ago, I met one girl and says: I'd like to meet the girl that killed the pig.</span> <span id="s807">So my husband start laughing.</span> <span id="s808">He says: You want to meet her?</span> <span id="s809">There she is.</span> <span id="s810">Because, you know, sometimes you go to a place, to a party or something, and you don't know who you see.</span> <span id="s811">You meet people that you were together -- or many times I go to a wedding, or even to a funeral.</span> <span id="s812">I went to a couple months ago, and I met somebody who I didn't see for four years, and he walked over and he recognized me.</span> <span id="s813">See, in our town it's different.</span> <span id="s814">If I would go back today to the place where I was born, 90 percent that was left of the people, they would know who I was.</span> <span id="s815">Even my husband, he went back 20 years ago, everybody asked: Are you Bruha's (ck) husband or Belima's husband?</span> <span id="s816">because they all knew us by the Jewish name.</span> <span id="s817">The non-Jews knew us by the Jewish name, because in the house they only speak Jewish.</span> <span id="s818">Until we went to school, we didn't know a word of Romanian, because it was strictly a Jewish housekeeping.</span> <span id="s819">Strictly Jewish.</span> <span id="s820">And the non-Jews used to learn Jewish.</span> <span id="s821">They used to talk to us in Jewish.</span> <span id="s822">We were very friendly with some of the neighbors.</span> <span id="s823">Only problem that we got was from the strangers; or, like you have here, the skinheads, or the ones coming in from other towns, say: Gee, the Jews are no good, or the Jews are this -- or they used to kill Jews, and they used to say: Kosher meat.</span> <span id="s824">All this was done not from the immediate area people, or even when they took us away, it wasn't done by the German people.</span> <span id="s825">It was done by the Hungarian collaborators that went from our town, because we had no Hungarians in our town.</span> <span id="s826">Our town they hate it that the Romanian -- that Romanian was, you weren't allowed to speak Hungarian.</span> <span id="s827">But when Hungarian was there, you weren't allowed to speak Romanian.</span> <span id="s828">And the Jews, no matter what you did, it was no good.</span> <span id="s829">If you had money, you were a thief.</span> <span id="s830">If you had no money, they killed you to get the money they didn't believe you don't have it.</span> <span id="s831">So it was a situation of no-win situation.</span> <span id="s832">The situation was bad in Europe since I remember it.</span> <span id="s833">But, it wasn't real bad until really when the ghetto started.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Then it was unbearable.</span> <span id="s835">And it wasn't going to get any better before the ghetto.</span> <span id="s836">Like, when the Germans came over to our town, because they were doing maneuvers in the mountains, because we lived near the city, they came in just very politely.</span> <span id="s837">Your master bedroom is taken for officers.</span> <span id="s838">You couldn't say yes or no.</span> <span id="s839">It was our house.</span> <span id="s840">We paid the taxes, but they were the rulers to it.</span> <span id="s841">This was -- it was such a ruling in there that twice, they -- once a week you were allowed to eat meat.</span> <span id="s842">If my mother cooked, when it wasn't supposed to be, we were always afraid the smell that if they come and they found out that you ate meat.</span> <span id="s843">That is how strict it was.</span> <span id="s844">My mother was very, very afraid.</span> <span id="s845">She was afraid of her shadow, and I was the opposite.</span> <span id="s846">I don't know why.</span> <span id="s847">I was like a rebellion.</span> <span id="s848">I always dared them, and sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn't.</span> <span id="s849">But this was my nature, and even now I am so determined.</span> <span id="s850">If I make up my mind, it's impossible to change it.</span> <span id="s851">My three sons, when we will get together and they will say -- we would talk, because I have three sons and they all lawyers.</span> <span id="s852">I said -- my sons say: I know you have the last word.</span> <span id="s853">But this is the way I was born.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">Q: Were you the only one in the family like this?</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s856">I'm the only one in the family that is like that, rebellion.</span> <span id="s857">I have a sister who is also a little -- wherever you put her, she'll stay.</span> <span id="s858">When we got liberated, I didn't know that being that my father was a citizen, we could have come right away over, all of us, with no questions asked.</span> <span id="s859">So my sister went to Italy.</span> <span id="s860">One of -- with her husband.</span> <span id="s861">My other sister was in France with her husband, and one was in Austria, and we all got different areas.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">So after the war we went back home to Romania first.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Q: How long did you stay outside of this camp area that you were in when you were liberated --</span></p> <p><span id="s864">A: One day.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">Q: -- where you ate the pig?</span></p> <p><span id="s866">A: After we ate the pig the next day we started going home.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">Q: Did that bother you, eating the pig, since you were so religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s868">A: What?</span> <span id="s869">People were eating rats and mice, believe it or not; if they were able to catch them.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">I was so religious after then, after I got home, and I find out that this Rabbi was home with -- in our town with 11 children, I turned.</span> <span id="s871">I rebelled to no extent.</span> <span id="s872">I started to believe in nothing.</span> <span id="s873">Despite that I was so religious, I believed in nothing after.</span> <span id="s874">And then when I came over to America and -- the children transport, and I got to my mother's cousin, that they took out -- they were looking who was left from the family.</span> <span id="s875">See, my mother -- from my mother's side, she had here her uncle and cousins.</span> <span id="s876">From my father's side, we had a lot of family in Mexico, because my father originally was from Spain.</span> <span id="s877">And when they start to leave from Spain, they came towards Poland and towards Romania.</span> <span id="s878">And they were pretty well old when they came from Spain, that they even named the town after my great grandfather.</span> <span id="s879">But little by little they took away everything.</span> <span id="s880">They send away that time, my father came to America, they sent them for trades.</span> <span id="s881">My father and one brother went to Mexico, and then they came back.</span> <span id="s882">But the situation was, at that time, people were pretty well to do there.</span> <span id="s883">They found Romania a little country, which was like, you could get anything you wanted there.</span> <span id="s884">Everything was -- when it was in the beginning was pretty good.</span> <span id="s885">In the early -- in the teens, in 1913, and 15 it was very good.</span> <span id="s886">In the '20s, the early '20s it was pretty good.</span> <span id="s887">But the late 30s, before Hungary came over, and then when the war started, then it started -- they always was blaming the Jews for it.</span> <span id="s888">If the Hungarian was taken over from the Romanian, they would blame the Jew were collaborators.</span> <span id="s889">The Jew had nothing to do with it.</span> <span id="s890">They always said the Jewish were the bankers, because they had money.</span> <span id="s891">Even if they had no money, they didn't believe them.</span> <span id="s892">Like I said, my father -- and we were pretty well off until everything was taken away.</span> <span id="s893">If you had three cows and the other one had 12, like I told you, they took from the Jews first, even if he had three and he had one.</span> <span id="s894">It didn't mean anything -- the Jewish, it was easy.</span> <span id="s895">We had no police, and everybody had to be guard.</span> <span id="s896">In our town there were 20 families or 30 Jewish families.</span> <span id="s897">The rest were non-Jews.</span> <span id="s898">We served as a guard a couple times a year.</span> <span id="s899">Even if they would take from ever family one night to be a guard, so my father used to pay for somebody to be a guard for the day -- for the night.</span> <span id="s900">So they used to pay it to guard the town.</span> <span id="s901">There was no police.</span> <span id="s902">Everything was private.</span> <span id="s903">But it was paid mostly from the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">Q: When after you ate the pig, and you all decided, the ten of you, yes, decided that you were going to go back to your hometown --</span></p> <p><span id="s905">A: I was the leader.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q: You were the leader.</span> <span id="s907">Why did you make that decision?</span></p> <p><span id="s908">A: Well, we went home to see who was coming back.</span> <span id="s909">We figured maybe who survived.</span> <span id="s910">Maybe our parents survived.</span> <span id="s911">Maybe the children.</span> <span id="s912">We didn't know who survived.</span> <span id="s913">We didn't know when the rest of them got liberated.</span> <span id="s914">So we start walking.</span> <span id="s915">Most of the houses were empty.</span> <span id="s916">We were in Estonia.</span> <span id="s917">From Estonia to Budapest, we went by foot.</span> <span id="s918">From January 21st to March 17th, we went every night, we went from one place to the other one.</span> <span id="s919">And most of the houses, they were empty.</span> <span id="s920">You could go in -- in the immediate area where we were liberated, we went in and the stove was still on hot.</span> <span id="s921">The food was in it.</span> <span id="s922">I said: Don't touch anything.</span> <span id="s923">It's poisoned.</span> <span id="s924">Because the food -- they left the food.</span> <span id="s925">People ran away.</span> <span id="s926">And we find these curtains, so we took the curtains, and put it around ourself.</span> <span id="s927">It's the fur coat, or if we find an old pair of shoes and change from the thing.</span> <span id="s928">But there was no clothing.</span> <span id="s929">See, when people left, they left the furniture, and they left food in the basement.</span> <span id="s930">Like, there was cabbage, sour cabbage, or pickles, or wine.</span> <span id="s931">But the food was on the stove, I says: Don't touch it, because they probably prepared it for somebody to be poisoned.</span> <span id="s932">We ate raw potatoes.</span> <span id="s933">We didn't take the food as cooked (ck).</span> <span id="s934">So the first night we ended up sleeping in the dentist's office, because we saw the dentist chair and they had yet all the equipment for a dentist's office.</span> <span id="s935">It was very nicely furnished.</span> <span id="s936">We went upstairs.</span> <span id="s937">There was a bedroom.</span> <span id="s938">We figured, nobody's there.</span> <span id="s939">If they're going to come in, they're not going to shoot us anymore.</span> <span id="s940">It's not that kind of people there.</span> <span id="s941">We'll go upstairs there.</span> <span id="s942">There was a piano, and there was a big mirror in front of the piano.</span> <span id="s943">It was a baby grand piano, and a big mirror -- it was a well-to-do dentist.</span> <span id="s944">We went on the second floor to sleep.</span> <span id="s945">On the floor.</span> <span id="s946">The ten of us we always stuck together, because if anything happened, they're not going to shoot ten together.</span> <span id="s947">And they're not going to do anything for ten, and we are going to have time to run.</span> <span id="s948">The Russians came up with the horses on the second floor.</span> <span id="s949">The horse saw the piano in the mirror.</span> <span id="s950">He saw the mirror.</span> <span id="s951">He saw the reflection of the horse.</span> <span id="s952">He put the foot on the piano, and we started running at night, because the Russians were on the second floor with the horse.</span> <span id="s953">And then I said: No more sleeping at night, because look what's going on with the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Q: What is going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s955">A: We were afraid of them, because they stopped once and they -- one offered us a lift during the day.</span> <span id="s956">We were the ten of us going together.</span> <span id="s957">They say: You want a lift?</span> <span id="s958">Well, we said yes.</span> <span id="s959">One girl was up in the truck, and they start rolling.</span> <span id="s960">So we pulled her down, and she was full of -- bleeding from her knee, because we pulled her down, and she fell on her knee, and we never took any lifts after.</span> <span id="s961">From then on --</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: What was she -- could you explain then, what was he doing to her?</span></p> <p><span id="s963">A: Nothing he was.</span> <span id="s964">When she was in the truck, he started rolling with the truck.</span> <span id="s965">He didn't wait for all of us.</span> <span id="s966">When the one girl was there, he started the truck rolling.</span> <span id="s967">So we grabbed her by the hand, and this is the way we pulled her down from the back of the truck.</span> <span id="s968">And I said: From now on no more lifts from the Russians.</span> <span id="s969">We have to learn to go by foot.</span> <span id="s970">And I said: We have to learn to sleep during the day and run at night when they are not around.</span> <span id="s971">We were so afraid -- we were afraid from the Russians.</span> <span id="s972">I -- almost as much from the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">Q: Did you think they were going to kill you?</span></p> <p><span id="s974">A: No.</span> <span id="s975">We were afraid they were going to rape us.</span> <span id="s976">Q: Did you see evidence of that or --</span></p> <p><span id="s977">A: No, there were rapes.</span> <span id="s978">There were a lot of girls who saying that they were raped.</span> <span id="s979">I know many people from my hometown who were raped from the Russians after the liberation.</span> <span id="s980">And there were many people who were raped from the Germans while they were there at gunpoint.</span> <span id="s981">So we were afraid for that more even for the Russians than from the Germans.</span> <span id="s982">The Germans, you have no choice, but now I figure you could run, and we started running at night.</span> <span id="s983">At night we were running.</span> <span id="s984">During the day, whatever we were able, we stole from here and from there.</span> <span id="s985">Whatever we find, we ate, and we went.</span> <span id="s986">We went like that, stealing and going from January 'til March until we came to Budapest.</span> <span id="s987">When we were in Budapest, then we spoke the language.</span> <span id="s988">Where we went was a Jewish organization.</span> <span id="s989">When we walked in and we said from where we coming, they were saying we were the first to come back, and they said the dead are coming back from the other world.</span> <span id="s990">Then they give us -- put us -- and they called right away from there on the telephone to our town, because it was occupied by the Russians, but they had the Jewish leaders from the UJA.</span> <span id="s991">They had Jewish leaders in every part, and they told them that we coming, and there is a group of ten.</span> <span id="s992">And they put us on the train at Budapest, and we went to Cloche (ck) to Romania, and from there they was waiting for us with the bus.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">And we went straight into the hospital.</span> <span id="s994">And the first thing I remember is they put us on ice, because we were frost bitten.</span> <span id="s995">And that I remember -- I couldn't understand, we were frozen and everything, and they put us on ice.</span> <span id="s996">And they did give us pig to eat, and there was no kosher, nothing.</span> <span id="s997">They gave us the smoked pig to recuperate.</span> <span id="s998">Then they opened a Jewish kitchen, from the joint in our town.</span> <span id="s999">We were there at that time, people were coming from Romania, from all over.</span> <span id="s1000">They were traveling back and forth looking for family, and we went to our town to find the house empty.</span> <span id="s1001">Nothing in it.</span> <span id="s1002">Every window broken.</span> <span id="s1003">We don't know who did it.</span> <span id="s1004">Why it was with nothing livable in the house.</span> <span id="s1005">So we went into the city, and we figure we start all over again.</span> <span id="s1006">There was one place with a big room, and that they had furniture -- better furniture that they collected from the Jewish houses, and pictures, and things like that.</span> <span id="s1007">We took a little furniture and we took a room, and we went to work.</span> <span id="s1008">As soon as we started, we waited to see who is coming home from the family.</span> <span id="s1009">We were there from March to Purim, the following Purim.</span> <span id="s1010">In the meantime my sister's husband came home, one of them, and she became pregnant.</span> <span id="s1011">And she had a daughter who was born, the first child after the liberation, who was born in Romania.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">And now they are in Israel, and she is -- my niece is in Bodylon (ck).</span> <span id="s1013">She is a professor of chemical, chemist professor, in Bodylon (ck).</span> <span id="s1014">She was in school in Romania and then she went -- they immigrated to Israel 20 years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">Q: How many people of your family showed up?</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: In Dashe (ck) my sister find her husband who was invalid, because he stepped on a bomb, and his foot was blown off.</span> <span id="s1017">And she find her husband.</span> <span id="s1018">Then somebody came from our town and said: I saw your brother being killed.</span> <span id="s1019">He says the Germans were forcing him because he was so religious -- they were forcing him to eat, and he didn't want to eat.</span> <span id="s1020">It was just before the liberation, a couple of days.</span> <span id="s1021">He was only eating bread and water, and they forced him to eat non-kosher food, and he refused, and they pulled his beard out, and they hatched him to death.</span> <span id="s1022">So we waited and we waited.</span> <span id="s1023">And then we got a letter from another brother who was in Austria, and he says he can't come home any more.</span> <span id="s1024">He knows the situation that nobody is coming home.</span> <span id="s1025">He says: If you want to meet him, he was in Austria to write to him.</span> <span id="s1026">And then Purim came, and a group of Polish people had a theater, a Jewish theater.</span> <span id="s1027">And after the theater he said, the Russian are looking for workers, and you know whose it's going to be again.</span> <span id="s1028">The person that is going to pick us, the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1029">The best thing for you is to leave.</span> <span id="s1030">So I went home and I packed.</span> <span id="s1031">I packed, and my sister who had the baby, and the baby was only a couple months old, and I left the keys with her.</span> <span id="s1032">I said: Look, I'm leaving tonight.</span> <span id="s1033">My other sister was just married three days before my second sister, and the third sister was married.</span> <span id="s1034">So the three of them were married.</span> <span id="s1035">I was the only one single.</span> <span id="s1036">One had her husband who came back from the war, and the other two got married right there in Dashe (ck).</span> <span id="s1037">And I said: Look, you're all married, and I have nothing to look here for.</span> <span id="s1038">I says: Anybody who came back, as far as boys, are older people, or I'm not interested.</span> <span id="s1039">I have nothing to do here.</span> <span id="s1040">I'm going to my brother in Austria.</span> <span id="s1041">So I said: Here is the key.</span> <span id="s1042">I left it with my sister with the baby.</span> <span id="s1043">I says: Here is the key in case they catch us at the border and I have to return, I'll come back.</span> <span id="s1044">So at that time I was trying to write a book about my history from the Logger (ck), from day one, everything what happened.</span> <span id="s1045">But we went to the border, when I had to drop everything, because I put it in Hungarian and then Romanian, and the language that I figured I would translate it later.</span> <span id="s1046">When we crossed the border, I had to destroy everything because we had to pay.</span> <span id="s1047">For the Russian to cross, it was easy.</span> <span id="s1048">We used to give them a bottle of Vodka, and you could cross 40 people with a bottle of Vodka.</span> <span id="s1049">They looked at the other side, you cross the border.</span> <span id="s1050">So we went to the mountains, 40 miles; from one border to the other one, even after the liberation, to get together, because we were on the Russian border.</span> <span id="s1051">We had to cross through the English zone, and from the English zone to the French zone, from the French we went to the American zone.</span> <span id="s1052">Everything was a zone.</span> <span id="s1053">And wherever you went into a Logger (ck), everybody gave you injections.</span> <span id="s1054">You ask: For what injections?</span> <span id="s1055">That is the time the rules were as soon as you came in: "What's your name?"</span> <span id="s1056">and injection.</span> <span id="s1057">So for Passover we were in Udenburg (ck) in the English zone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">And at that point I wrote a letter to my brother, who was in Austria, and he was married, newly married.</span> <span id="s1059">And he wrote me back that he would send somebody who would bring me over to the American zone, because we couldn't get permission to leave.</span> <span id="s1060">There was a couple, an Austrian couple, dressed in Austrian clothes, carrying with them Austrian clothes, and they came for me, another fellow who had a brother there where my brother was.</span> <span id="s1061">And they paid them off, and they came to take us over.</span> <span id="s1062">And I went as the Austrian wife, and the fellow went as the Austrian's husband.</span> <span id="s1063">And with the false passport we crossed the border, and we arrived to Balkastan (ck).</span> <span id="s1064">I arrived to Balkastan (ck) there.</span> <span id="s1065">We were in the DP camps.</span> <span id="s1066">The displaced person camp.</span> <span id="s1067">We couldn't register, because we couldn't get food to register at that time.</span> <span id="s1068">Everybody went in, they had room in the hotel.</span> <span id="s1069">They were taken for the DP camps, but you had to have a card in order to go in to eat.</span> <span id="s1070">So the only thing I said to my brother: It's easier to eat if I'm going to work in the kitchen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">The kitchen, nobody wanted to work that time.</span> <span id="s1072">So all day we're peeling potatoes and carrots for the food.</span> <span id="s1073">And even at that time they give us a room.</span> <span id="s1074">We were -- after the liberation we were in one room with a single bed and a double bed, but no more room.</span> <span id="s1075">Only room to move around to the bed.</span> <span id="s1076">There was a mother and daughter who took the single bed.</span> <span id="s1077">And in the other bed was sleeping me, a cousin of mine, my sister and her husband in one double bed.</span> <span id="s1078">We slept there for three weeks.</span> <span id="s1079">And then they started to register us in, but I still remained working in the kitchen, because they had no help.</span> <span id="s1080">And I was in the kitchen and I was registered.</span> <span id="s1081">And then in September they said that the group, the younger group under 18 to register, because they go to the State.</span> <span id="s1082">There was a group that was going to go to the State.</span> <span id="s1083">At that point I registered.</span> <span id="s1084">I registered and I had to go to medical checkup.</span> <span id="s1085">I went in to the medical checkup.</span> <span id="s1086">I go downstairs to where the medical checkup was, and there was a fellow who I knew who was in a mental institute who acted as a doctor.</span> <span id="s1087">And I walked in, and I said: Crazy Blood, what are you doing here?</span> <span id="s1088">He looked at me, because I recognized everybody from the city and the town, because if I was dealing with milk and the eggs and with everything, I knew practically every person that lived in the city.</span> <span id="s1089">If I didn't know them, it was either he was too rich that I didn't deal with him, or too poor that they couldn't afford me to deal with him.</span> <span id="s1090">But I know this family.</span> <span id="s1091">He had a brother who was a dental technician.</span> <span id="s1092">But he a religious boy.</span> <span id="s1093">He was -- I don't know what was wrong with him, but they put him -- but they say he went in a mental institute, and everybody called him Crazy Blood.</span> <span id="s1094">His brother didn't come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">When I went down to the doctor, to the office there, he was a doctor.</span> <span id="s1096">When I saw him and I called him: Crazy Blood, what are you doing here?</span> <span id="s1097">He said: Shoo.</span> <span id="s1098">Don't tell anybody nothing.</span> <span id="s1099">You will be the first one to leave tomorrow.</span> <span id="s1100">When the group goes tomorrow or the day after, I will take care of your papers.</span> <span id="s1101">You will be the first one to leave.</span> <span id="s1102">But make sure you don't tell anybody nothing.</span> <span id="s1103">I said: Yes, but one thing.</span> <span id="s1104">The only thing you get from me is an X ray.</span> <span id="s1105">I will take no needles or no pills.</span> <span id="s1106">He says: You got a deal.</span> <span id="s1107">I was afraid to breathe to tell anybody who he was.</span> <span id="s1108">You wouldn't believe it, that after I came to America and I was in real estate, and I passed by, I saw Crazy Blood and I stopped inn.</span> <span id="s1109">He become a gynecologist in Manhattan.</span> <span id="s1110">So I don't know, was he crazy that he was in the mental institute.</span> <span id="s1111">I don't know.</span> <span id="s1112">He learned there with the people, and before he came to the State, he must have learned, because otherwise he couldn't have become a doctor in America.</span> <span id="s1113">But he was a gynecologist in the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">Q: You mentioned your sister was with you.</span> <span id="s1115">I thought you left alone?</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">A: I left alone.</span> <span id="s1117">They only took children.</span> <span id="s1118">The first group that came, I was there with my sister and my brother, my sister and her husband, my brother and his wife, and me.</span> <span id="s1119">We were in the same place.</span> <span id="s1120">And I had another sister and my brother-in-law who lived in Leads (ck), which was in a different camp, but it was about half an hour ride from where I was.</span> <span id="s1121">The only person that I was able to come that time was me, because I was under 18.</span> <span id="s1122">The children group came.</span> <span id="s1123">They took me as a child out first.</span> <span id="s1124">So they left -- were left behind, and I got here from -- after I got all the papers, I went to Seldersfinger (ck) in Germany, and from Germany they took us to Bremerhaven (ck).</span> <span id="s1125">In Bremerhaven there was a strike at that time.</span> <span id="s1126">In 1946 there was a strike for three months, and there we were quite crowded, because the groups kept on coming and no boats left.</span> <span id="s1127">And then finally in December the boat -- the strike was settled, and we went -- we started out on Marina Marlin (ck) with a boat, with an Army boat.</span> <span id="s1128">And in the channel the boat had a hole, and we had to jump in the rafts in December, in the ice.</span> <span id="s1129">And we wait for another boat, another Army boat to pick us up.</span> <span id="s1130">And ever since then, my husband wants to go for a cruise, I say: I've already had one cruise.</span> <span id="s1131">I'm afraid of the boats.</span> <span id="s1132">So when I got here, they took us -- the first time we arrived in America, they took us in a home.</span> <span id="s1133">It was an orphanage home.</span> <span id="s1134">And then my mother's cousin came to pick me up from there.</span> <span id="s1135">It was December the 20th, and I went there for the weekend.</span> <span id="s1136">I was there from -- for the weekend, and because she didn't say that I'm going to stay there, or I didn't know nothing.</span> <span id="s1137">She just took me for the weekend when I arrived, and she took me out for the weekend.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">And my mother's sister -- her cousin's sister, my mother's cousin sister and brother, they all came to see me.</span> <span id="s1139">After then she requested -- she asked me if want to stay there.</span> <span id="s1140">She had two girls younger than me.</span> <span id="s1141">And they were not rich people.</span> <span id="s1142">They were a butcher.</span> <span id="s1143">But they -- from the children transport, from the children group, because I come with the Jewish committee, they came out every month to ask me -- I had to go for medical checkups every month, and they came to ask me if I'm satisfied where I'm living.</span> <span id="s1144">And they wanted to pay at that time forty dollars a month.</span> <span id="s1145">They said: We do without the money, but instead of that, bring out a child.</span> <span id="s1146">She never took anything from them.</span> <span id="s1147">Like, the highest was the joy, and she didn't want to take anything from them.</span> <span id="s1148">And I was there with them --</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">Q: What are you thinking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">A: What...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">Q: What are you thinking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">A: They died, too.</span> <span id="s1153">That was like my second home.</span> <span id="s1154">I got married from them.</span> <span id="s1155">I lived with them from '46 to '53.</span> <span id="s1156">Then I had to go every month.</span> <span id="s1157">I had to go to the medical checkups, and I had to get injections.</span> <span id="s1158">I don't know why.</span> <span id="s1159">I don't know what kind of liquid injections.</span> <span id="s1160">I was trying to find out what kind of injections I got, because from the medication, from the injection that I got there, the period we never got.</span> <span id="s1161">I was here already two or three years, and I had to get special injections to start it up again.</span> <span id="s1162">Because I -- what medication -- either it was in the food or then it was in the injection that they gave in the concentration camp for cleanliness, that they shouldn't appear in the woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">Q: Do you remember any injection in the concentration camp?</span> <span id="s1164">A: Yes, when you arrived.</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">Q: In Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">A: In Auschwitz everybody got injections, but what kind of injection nobody know.</span> <span id="s1167">Some of them did get it back on their own.</span> <span id="s1168">But I remember going downtown in Yorkburg (ck) getting injections, and I went back but the place was demolished.</span> <span id="s1169">I don't know how to find out.</span> <span id="s1170">But I know I got injections, yeah.</span> <span id="s1171">I remember getting big, white liquid injections every single month.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">Q: Was this done in other camps?</span> <span id="s1173">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Q: The injections -- A. I got it in other camps, too.</span> <span id="s1175">The place when you went from one zone to another one, you got injections, but this injections were -- because from when we left the -- from Auschwitz until in 1948, nothing happened until I got the injections.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">Q: Did that worry you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">A: No.</span> <span id="s1178">I gained a lot of weight from it.</span> <span id="s1179">I was blown up from it.</span> <span id="s1180">It worried me too, because I figure if I ever got married, I wouldn't be able to have children.</span> <span id="s1181">And even after I got married, I had the children and everything, we were so frost bitten that -- we went this year, we went Costa Rica, and it was here the cold weather.</span> <span id="s1182">They were saying that the cows' udders were frozen.</span> <span id="s1183">That they didn't give any more milk.</span> <span id="s1184">You wouldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s1185">I didn't have a drop of milk, because I was all frost from the concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">Q: Do you remember noise in the concentration camp?</span> <span id="s1187">Were you able to sleep?</span> <span id="s1188">Did you dream?</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">A: Mostly the noise was in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1190">In Auschwitz you had a lot noise.</span> <span id="s1191">Shooting you heard constantly.</span> <span id="s1192">I mean, at that point if somebody got shot, you just envied them.</span> <span id="s1193">You never said: Gee, she got shot.</span> <span id="s1194">You always say: I wish it would have been me.</span> <span id="s1195">We never said: Gee, she got shot.</span> <span id="s1196">Poor thing.</span> <span id="s1197">We have to bury her.</span> <span id="s1198">We just said -- after work we took the party and we buried her, and we went, a couple of feet away from where we were staying.</span> <span id="s1199">We took the shovels and we dug two feet, maybe, because it was all frozen.</span> <span id="s1200">After work and after supper, we took the body and just buried them.</span> <span id="s1201">We didn't even think twice to write a name on the grave or anything.</span> <span id="s1202">Who would claim her?</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">Q: Did you ever think about suicide?</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">A: You couldn't think about it because you were hoping they should kill you.</span> <span id="s1205">Why would you commit suicide?</span> <span id="s1206">Take a shovel and hit yourself over the head.</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">Q: Did you know that the wires were electrified in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">A: No.</span> <span id="s1209">We didn't go near the wires.</span> <span id="s1210">We didn't know.</span> <span id="s1211">They didn't let you go near the wires.</span> <span id="s1212">We were in a camp there -- in the C Camp, the Ceron (ck) Camp, and we were there a short time.</span> <span id="s1213">The wires had torn, or whatever you call them.</span> <span id="s1214">But I didn't know if they were electrified or whatever, because we didn't see anybody go near the wires, because you couldn't go near because there was people there with the guns constantly.</span> <span id="s1215">For them to shoot the person, it was like nothing.</span> <span id="s1216">They used say one, two, three, four, five, ten -- bingo.</span> <span id="s1217">They would say for no reason at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">Q: Were you numb when that happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">A: It didn't numb me.</span> <span id="s1220">No.</span> <span id="s1221">Sometimes you would say: Gee, when you count ten, you would say, I wish I would be the tenth.</span> <span id="s1222">Because you were so depressed at that point, that you really didn't care.</span> <span id="s1223">It didn't bother you if they killed you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">Q: When did you learn that -- what was happening?</span> <span id="s1225">There were so many thousands and hundreds of thousands and millions of people were killed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">A: Well, when we got to Auschwitz, and as we went in the group, you knew every day there were less and less of us.</span> <span id="s1227">Then they were saying -- we were talking, we were going from one camp to the other, you always meet people from different areas.</span> <span id="s1228">So when we went to Sutthauf (ck), there you met people from Poland.</span> <span id="s1229">Who would say: Gee, when did they bring you over?</span> <span id="s1230">We said in June.</span> <span id="s1231">They say: Where were you before June?</span> <span id="s1232">We says: We were in the ghetto, I said.</span> <span id="s1233">They ask me how long were you in the ghetto?</span> <span id="s1234">I said: A month.</span> <span id="s1235">She said: A month?</span> <span id="s1236">She says: We were in the ghetto four, five years, and we are here already four years.</span> <span id="s1237">She says: We were in the ghetto, she says, so many thousands, she says, 20, 30 thousand, and every day they always used to kill people.</span> <span id="s1238">They used to dig trenches, and they used to shoot them -- they used to say people used to make their own trenches, and they used to shoot them to fall into them.</span> <span id="s1239">They said at least they were decent enough, they took the dirt and they throwed it on the top, otherwise they were mass murders.</span> <span id="s1240">They used to tell me.</span> <span id="s1241">And from in the beginning, I didn't want to believe everything.</span> <span id="s1242">I said: Really?</span> <span id="s1243">I says: It really happened like that?</span> <span id="s1244">She said: I saw it with my own eyes.</span> <span id="s1245">I said: How did you survive?</span> <span id="s1246">She said: Because they put us in a truck and they took us tour (ck).</span> <span id="s1247">She said she saw her parents being killed like that.</span> <span id="s1248">She saw the whole town practically being killed like that.</span> <span id="s1249">But you see -- you see, in the place that we lived, nobody wanted to believe that it could be such a cruelty.</span> <span id="s1250">See, I had my brother who was now in South America, who was a Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s1251">In 1940 when Hungary came over, anybody who was over 22, the Jewish people and they were well to do, or something, they took them for labor camp.</span> <span id="s1252">That was before anything else.</span> <span id="s1253">And my brother was put in the labor.</span> <span id="s1254">They gave him a yellow band or a white band.</span> <span id="s1255">If they were half Jews, they gave you a white band.</span> <span id="s1256">If you were Jewish, they gave you a yellow band.</span> <span id="s1257">But we were wearing the Jewish star, the Morgan David star, and they should know that we are Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">Then you had to be restricted.</span> <span id="s1259">Your store was not your store anymore.</span> <span id="s1260">You were working for somebody.</span> <span id="s1261">They came in and they said: From now on, the store is mine, but you still have to run it.</span> <span id="s1262">But all the profits were theirs.</span> <span id="s1263">They confiscated practically everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">They said all these things, everybody says it's going to pass by.</span> <span id="s1265">It's only temporary through the way.</span> <span id="s1266">Nobody believed that it was going to be stretching like that.</span> <span id="s1267">It's just like somebody would walk in here, and they would say: Gee, get ready.</span> <span id="s1268">In two weeks, they get all the Jews together.</span> <span id="s1269">Would you believe?</span> <span id="s1270">Nobody wanted to believe it there either.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">Until when it happened.</span> <span id="s1272">And when it happened, it was too late, because they were taught one thing, not to fight back.</span> <span id="s1273">If you don't fight back, it's not going to be so bad.</span> <span id="s1274">You know, like many people says, if they were to allow people to fight back, but many in Poland did fight back.</span> <span id="s1275">But us -- they would say it's the law.</span> <span id="s1276">You got to do what the law says.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">Everybody followed the law.</span> <span id="s1278">They thought the law was right, but unfortunately nobody believed it.</span> <span id="s1279">When we came back, when I came back and I found out that nobody is coming home after a year.</span> <span id="s1280">I said, the war is over a year, if you didn't hear by mail or if nobody came home, that means it's over.</span> <span id="s1281">The war is over, nobody else will come home.</span> <span id="s1282">So then we started rolling.</span> <span id="s1283">I left the country, and I came over here, and my sister went to South America, my brother, because they are -- like I said, they were three kind of children: Mine, yours and ours.</span> <span id="s1284">From my brother's mother's sister was a Montevideo.</span> <span id="s1285">So there they gave visas out.</span> <span id="s1286">Here they weren't able to get visas out.</span> <span id="s1287">So my brother went to his aunt.</span> <span id="s1288">And my other sister was my real sister, she -- I said: How much does a visa cost?</span> <span id="s1289">They said $120, so I send $120 to South America that they should send a visa in order for her to go to South America.</span> <span id="s1290">So my other sister went, and my brother was in South America until 1962, that I got her the papers to come over here to America with me.</span> <span id="s1291">My other sister was in California now, originally came out to Canada, because what is here would cost.</span> <span id="s1292">And the two sisters that were in Romania, eventually immigrated to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">Q: Did you talk to that Rabbi who came back with the 11 children?</span> <span id="s1294">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">Q: What did you say to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">A: When I came back to Dashe (ck) after the concentration camp, and I saw -- I sent to the border, I went to the ghetto to see what's going on there.</span> <span id="s1297">I took the girl, the one that was so mean to us, and I did give her -- I beat her up once about an hour, just because she was so mean to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">Q: Physically beat her up?</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">A: Physically beat her up.</span> <span id="s1300">And then I went over to the Rabbi, and I did confront him.</span> <span id="s1301">If it would have been up to me, I would have put him in jail for that.</span> <span id="s1302">All I said to him, I said: Look, if you wanted to leave, fine.</span> <span id="s1303">You should have keep your mouth shut.</span> <span id="s1304">And leave, anybody who was able to leave, to leave.</span> <span id="s1305">I said I would have -- I said I came back, but there was a possibility I could have saved my little brother.</span> <span id="s1306">My parents went anyhow, because they listened to you, I said.</span> <span id="s1307">But my little brother I had already my bag on my shoulder, and the kid in the hand, when my mother says: You know, you were a seven- month baby, and I spend most of the time watching you more than anybody else, and you could leave me just like that and you heard what the Rabbi said.</span> <span id="s1308">So I put down the kid and the thing.</span> <span id="s1309">My mother said, you know, something was saying (ck).</span> <span id="s1310">So I didn't.</span> <span id="s1311">So I said to her, he didn't answer.</span> <span id="s1312">I wanted that time but everybody says: Look, how is it going to look if one Jew is going to start against another Jew.</span> <span id="s1313">I didn't do nothing.</span> <span id="s1314">My sister came from South America.</span> <span id="s1315">When she came to live in Yonkers, she used to go to Brooklyn, and she met him, because he married her in Dashe (ck), my sister.</span> <span id="s1316">And I was very rebellious.</span> <span id="s1317">I said: If I would have to get married today, I said I would go to a priest before I go to this Rabbi.</span> <span id="s1318">I said, because to me he is not a Rabbi.</span> <span id="s1319">I says I wouldn't want his blessing.</span> <span id="s1320">And then, when my sister came over here, and she was in Brooklyn, and she met with him, and once I also got a telephone call.</span> <span id="s1321">And they said, you know, Rabbi Ponit is getting blind, and I'm collecting money for him for eye surgery.</span> <span id="s1322">So I said very nicely, I said: If he would be a mute, then I said, I would gladly have send him some money for eye surgery.</span> <span id="s1323">I'm sorry he lasted that long, and that he only now became blind, and I hanged up.</span> <span id="s1324">This was about eight or nine years ago, or maybe 12 years.</span> <span id="s1325">I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">Time flys.</span> <span id="s1327">But this is what happened here in the State.</span> <span id="s1328">That is what I said to you, I was very outspoken and I was very rebellion.</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">Q: What about the -- that captain who helped you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">A: I looked him up.</span> <span id="s1331">He wasn't there, because, you see, he was a real Hungarian.</span> <span id="s1332">He came, you know, when the area where we were was Romania, and the captain went back, when the Hungarians left, he had left.</span> <span id="s1333">And I couldn't trace him, because I only know his name was Istchone (ck).</span> <span id="s1334">Now there is so many Istchons (ck), it's like here, you would look for a Joe.</span> <span id="s1335">You couldn't trace him.</span> <span id="s1336">You couldn't go to the Romanian government to find out where the Hungarian government went.</span> <span id="s1337">But I would have liked to trace him, but it was just impossible because the whole thing changed.</span> <span id="s1338">Now you see, like you were born in one country, and then the next day it was a different country, and you can't trace one after another.</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">Q: Before we look at the pictures, is there anything else you would like to tell us about in terms of your experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">A: In here or after or from home?</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">Q: Before you came to the United States.</span> <span id="s1342">Is there anything you would like to talk about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">A: Well, I told you about my father, who was an American.</span> <span id="s1344">I don't know if he become a citizen of New York or in San Francisco.</span> <span id="s1345">Then he came home to get married, and the first wife was very -- after -- she was so beautiful, that is what I heard, that when he got married they had to have police on the roofs, because they were promising that they were going to steal the bride.</span> <span id="s1346">They had five children.</span> <span id="s1347">Then she become very ill, and in Europe they didn't have no medication for any kind of an illness, practically.</span> <span id="s1348">People died if they stepped on a nail from the infection.</span> <span id="s1349">I know, for the first time I went into a church, because we were very religious, I had a friend that stepped on a nail, and she was only eight years old and she died.</span> <span id="s1350">I asked my mother permission to go to the funeral, because we were neighbors, and we were classmates.</span> <span id="s1351">And that's the first time that I went into a church in Romania, because it was her funeral.</span> <span id="s1352">She was eight years old.</span> <span id="s1353">And even -- then after then when my mother was married, they married her very young.</span> <span id="s1354">She was married when she was 15 and half to an uncle of hers, because the aunt had died.</span> <span id="s1355">And there was all furnished -- at that time they married her off because she didn't have to give her no money, and they were people that -- she figured that he already has a house arrangement, and everything, so they married her over 15 and a half, without her being asked, are you going to get married or no.</span> <span id="s1356">So when she had the first child, she got divorced.</span> <span id="s1357">She lived in the same town where my father lived with his wife and the five children.</span> <span id="s1358">When she got very ill, she was going over there to help her with the five children, and they become very friendly.</span> <span id="s1359">And she said to my mother: I can't die until you don't give me your hand, that you will take care of my children.</span> <span id="s1360">So my mother went to the Rabbi -- after she died, she died shaking hands with my mother.</span> <span id="s1361">And she went over to the Rabbi, and the Rabbi say: You can give the hand to a person who is dying, you must keep your promise.</span> <span id="s1362">And he divorced my mother.</span> <span id="s1363">And absentee of her husband, who was away in the Army, they give her a get in order to marry my father.</span> <span id="s1364">Then we were, like I said, three type of children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">And I didn't know -- in our house we didn't know that we were three type of children.</span> <span id="s1366">Until it came a holiday, and my mother dressed us, the youngest in one in red dots.</span> <span id="s1367">When it come a holiday for Pesach and for Sukkah, everybody get new shoes and dresses.</span> <span id="s1368">So it came a holiday when I was about seven years, eight years old, and I got dresses with my two youngest -- my older sister and my younger sister, we got red polka dots, and they got blue polka dots, but the same dresses.</span> <span id="s1369">As we came from the Synagogue, from the Shul, our neighbor say: How nice of Ruhoff (ck) -- that was my mother's name.</span> <span id="s1370">And now my son's daughter, who lives here in Silver Spring, carries my mother's name.</span> <span id="s1371">So she says: How nice of Ruhoff (ck) that she dresses her children in red and his children in blue.</span> <span id="s1372">So I went home, I says: What did she mean by that?</span> <span id="s1373">That his children dressed in blue and we are not.</span> <span id="s1374">Then I was told that what happened, because I ask.</span> <span id="s1375">Otherwise, probably I wouldn't have known for the longest time.</span> <span id="s1376">Eventually, probably they would have tell me.</span> <span id="s1377">But then I was told what happened, and why that's his children because her mother had died.</span> <span id="s1378">Because, when, you know, you are young if you have parents you weren't allowed to go even to the cemetery.</span> <span id="s1379">Here, everybody goes.</span> <span id="s1380">Children, not children.</span> <span id="s1381">But there, it was a different kind of a -- I don't whether it was tradition, or there was a rule that anybody who had parents wasn't supposed to go to a cemetery.</span> <span id="s1382">So the children used to go there after them, and they got a little older.</span> <span id="s1383">They used to go to their mother's grave, the older ones, after.</span> <span id="s1384">I find out that my mother used to take them to their mother's grave.</span> <span id="s1385">But it was a long time until I find out that we are not from one mother and father.</span> <span id="s1386">So even now we are very close.</span> <span id="s1387">We were always close, and we still correspond with each other.</span> <span id="s1388">Our brother was here.</span> <span id="s1389">We were in South America last year, and we were in Israel last year.</span> <span id="s1390">We see each other.</span> <span id="s1391">Unfortunately, not every year, because one is in South America, and the other one is in Israel, and one in California, and we haven't seen them for two years, but we talk on the telephone.</span> <span id="s1392">We correspond and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">Q: Can we stop for a moment, and set it up so we can look at the pictures.</span> <span id="s1394">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">[Viewing of photographs]</span></p></body></html>
