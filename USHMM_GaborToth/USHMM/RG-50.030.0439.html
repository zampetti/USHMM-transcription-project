they came to our apartment, we didn't live in a house any more, I told you.</span> <span id="s104">And we lived in an apartment with my mother together and they came and went to all the drawers and took my jewelry and put in their pocket, you know, that's the Viennese.</span> <span id="s105">The Germans would really make a list maybe, because they're very perfectionist and then they said, so now

id="s122">Q: Now this was the apartment that you shared with your husband or was there other family?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: With my husband, no, with my mother.</span> <span id="s124">We lived with my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: Then this was in the same place where you grew up?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: No, no, I told you, I grew up with our own house and everything and when I was 16, we went broke and then we took and apartment and my mother and I went to work.</span> <span id="s127">And, but it was the ________________.</span> <span id="s128">And then, about a week later, my husband was an engineer, he had a friend from college, but he was a Nazi official, and he had to me said, yeah he said, I want to meet you next to the police station, so my husband said, I'm not going to the police station.</span> <span id="s129">So he said you have to leave Vienna in three days, if not, they come and get you.</span> <span id="s130">And my sister went to England right away and she promised that she would send us a permit, an affidavit was in the mail, a permit and then one day she wrote I couldn't do it, so I said, what could we do, we have to go in three days.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: How did you feel then, I mean what . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: Nothing, yeah, my husband was sitting there.</span> <span id="s133">I said, okay, we have to leave in three days, let's go to any, I don't know where.</span> <span id="s134">There was only one ticket available, so that's out, so what.</span> <span id="s135">So we decided to go illegally to Cologne and go from there to Belgium.</span> <span id="s136">What we did and we were gone in three days.</span> <span id="s137">We stayed there with other Jewish people and you know the German Jews they said, oh I was born in Germany, I want to die in Germany, nothing is going to happen.</span> <span id="s138">They had too little, I mean teenage girls they went to dance every Saturday, they came back to Cologne.</span> <span id="s139">____________ you know, on the Rhine.</span> <span id="s140">And so, but they knew how to escape and they send us some people we had to pay and they took us through there legally, you know, through that ____________ and to Belgium and there were, underneath the raincoats they had the SS uniform, the black, but they weren't, they made money, no matter what.</span> <span id="s141">And we came, it was in January '39, and we went through the snow and sounds like ____________ something, and went to follow the leaders you know, from the Belgium boys and it wasn't hard to see them, it was dark, but they had so much perfume that you could smell them.</span> <span id="s142">So we came to Liege(ph), what is the name of Liege(ph), ________________, that's German.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: And how were you traveling?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: We walked through the snow.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: You were walking the whole, now this . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: And they carried us over the ice in the winter, through the river.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: Describe a little bit, can you describe some of the details, what were you wearing, was it freezing cold, were you warm enough?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: Oh yes, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: Difficult, or?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: Oh my God, I had boots, but.</span> <span id="s151">Well I was young then.</span> <span id="s152">My husband was young.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: Did it feel like a terrible thing, like an adventure, like a . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: No, it felt that we have to do it and that's what it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: Well you were just philosophical about it, did you feel uprooted, I mean I guess I wonder how you felt at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: You feel nothing at a moment like this, which was really the best part of everything.</span> <span id="s157">So we came to no man's land and so the leaders, the boys the Belgium boys said, so now you can say ____________ Hitler, they won't catch you, you're in Belgium, now but it was the Belgium people would send people back and then you get _______________ to the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s158">So they took us to Antwerp, it's a beautiful city.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: Who's they?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: In Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: No, but they took, the Belgium authorities?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: No, oh no, no, the guards didn't know we were there.</span> <span id="s163">They brought us in the Jewish _______________, that was an organization, and we got food, bed and warm clothes and we were sitting there, there was a man going back and forth, back and forth, looked at my husband and then we were scared, we thought we saw a Gestapo man in everybody.</span> <span id="s164">So the man said to my husband, is your name Scheuer, oh my God yes, how'd you know?</span> <span id="s165">I went to school with your father.</span> <span id="s166">And we were very lucky and he went to the authorization and they made us that we could stay, but we were not able, we couldn't work there because that would be wrong to take the work away from the natives.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: The Belgian people.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: So we went in a family camp.</span> <span id="s169">In an old, it was once a prison, but very nice, beautiful and the director was the chief there and every family had a room of his own and everybody had to do something to work for your keep, you know.</span> <span id="s170">And I had to clean the garden, I had 20 little boys and girls, so another woman was ironing and the men had the, did the washing, my husband did the talking in the dining room because there was a, German and Austrian is very different, so my husband had no accent so they both would understand him.</span> <span id="s171">So then in May Hitler invaded Belgium in '39, yeah.</span> <span id="s172">So everybody, everybody, Christians and Jews, everybody wanted to walk to Paris, and on the streets you saw, like you see in the film on television, you see refugees and they took everything they could carry on their backs and they had cars, the Belgium people and the cars didn't have any gas, so they had to leave them right on the street and the Germans came with the Stuttgarts(ph), the planes you know, down to shoot at the crowd and make believe there were soldiers, but they knew quite well, they were close enough to see they were civilians and it was a good opportunity to lose their husbands or their wife if they couldn't get along anyway, that was the moment and it was terrible, we saw dead bodies in bed, dogs and masters, it looked like from ____, don't look.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: How close did they come to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: Not anywhere, up in the air, they were close enough to see they were civilians fleeing from Belgium to France.</span> <span id="s175">So we came to _______________, it's not too far from Paris and we went to a shelter, they bombed, the Germans went, they wanted to go to Paris and they did, so when we woke up in the shelter we slept, oh look ____________ sleep.</span> <span id="s176">They said we don't do anything to you, go back home.</span> <span id="s177">Now, we had no home, so we went back and there was a village, it was burning, went to the police station and said, can we stay there overnight, in France?</span> <span id="s178">No, no, no, you are free, go.</span> <span id="s179">So we had to go back and partly they took us, vans took us back and the authorities said it's not good to go back to Antwerp because it's a port city, so we decided to go to Brussels.</span> <span id="s180">We didn't know anyone.</span> <span id="s181">We don't, oh in between, the French arrested us because my husband wore a trenchcoat like the real spies, ________________, you know.</span> <span id="s182">And they said we are German spies, who, because for the French we had an accent, we were Germans and for the Germans we were Jews.</span> <span id="s183">So you had your choice.</span> <span id="s184">Anyway, and it's the truth, they put us against the wall, the French and some lilacs, oh it's a beautiful month, the month of May, now we have to die.</span> <span id="s185">They're ready to shoot us.</span> <span id="s186">So then they looked the documents and they said we were Jewish and that's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: Did they feel sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: We weren't dead, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: What was their reaction when they realized that you were not German spies?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: Nothing, you're free, you're free, it was war, my God.</span> <span id="s191">You know the French, they stood at the main square, with a ________________ terrible, they were not a ____________ to avoid, the Germans _______________ oh my God, just like nothing.</span> <span id="s192">Yeah, we stayed at the _______________ line, you know, it's a big, big _______________, it's beautiful.</span> <span id="s193">But there was a big hole between the land and the ocean, that's where the Germans went through, like nothing, and the tanks, terrible.</span> <span id="s194">So, went to Brussels and we had to, we had the star, it's in the envelope there.</span> <span id="s195">There's the Jewish star we had to wear openly and not hide it and you saw earlier some high officer, they make believe they were sorry, I don't know how sorry they were.</span> <span id="s196">Okay, this is the Jewish star, you had to wear on the left hand side, well you saw that before, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: I haven't seen one up this close.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: Yeah but, I was very neat, I lined it, see.</span> <span id="s199">And I sewed it on all my garments.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: It's just a little piece of cloth, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: Yeah, I lined it.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: J.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: It's Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: _______________, same in French.</span> <span id="s206">And you didn't, the jays, yeah.</span> <span id="s207">And so we stayed in Brussels until I got the invitation, written invitation to go to the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s208">In German and in French, and on this . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: Can you read that?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: Hmm?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: Can you read that?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A:

ours was because we came from Germany or Austria.</span> <span id="s245">So we had friends and they said if ever you get this, because they knew what it was, you come here, so we got there, locked the door and said so take off the stars and we go somewhere, we going to hide you.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: This was not until later though, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: No, that was in

another young girl, she was a pianist too, and she was hidden there.</span> <span id="s267">So one day we had to go out because the people around were supposed to know that we were there hidden and he

Anne Frank we saw, we sat behind the glass door with curtains and the Germans came and bought in his store and he said we are going to England, you know, now we're going to invade England, but then it so happened that man where we stayed, who was hiding us, he was a spy for Belgium against the Germans, they hated the Germans and he belonged to an organization, the name was ________________.</span>

kitchen really American, and they invited him to the Gestapo and he played silly.</span> <span id="s277">Just like that he sat there.</span> <span id="s278">He went to the Gestapo, took his lunch along, and they interviewed him and they couldn't prove anything, so they send him home.</span> <span id="s279">But it was very dangerous for us too, you know, because they could find us.</span> <span id="s280">So we went to the lady's sister, and nobody knew, nobody of her relatives knew that we were hidden there and I was knitting, yeah I didn't, I was not allowed to talk, because I have an

open my mouth to talk French.</span> <span id="s283">So they said I was some relative, distant relative and my husband was in the war, he died in the war and _______________ not there.</span> <span id="s284">But I was knitting, the little girl said, well you knit different from my mommy, you know, really you wouldn't think so, a child knows.</span> <span id="s285">Anyway, so then we got the message for him.</span> <span id="s286">The Gestapo is after you, so we had to go somewhere else.</span> <span id="s287">And we had a lot of fun really, we had two daughters, and oh really, we had everything.</span> <span id="s288">We weren't hungry.</span> <span id="s289">And then we went to another house and the other house, the neighbor went in and out like you know, an open door, and so we

very, very nice.</span> <span id="s301">Beautiful home.</span> <span id="s302">One day there was a man knocking at the door and he really looked suspicious and I don't know, we always sat in the kitchen and that was a German spy and three weeks later, somebody else knew, they were going to take Mr. Millot(ph) and his son.</span> <span id="s303">There was no, and at that time there was one man

now, and English and American troops came to Brussels and my husband went out, oh he, you know for joy, shouted, shouted, so happy, he came home, he was hoarse.</span> <span id="s305">And so we were

job, because of my good English.</span> <span id="s308">It wasn't so good.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: It's very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: No, I always had an accent.</span> <span id="s311">Anyway in Belgium, everybody speaks perfect German, French and English, everybody, because it's a small country, beautiful country.</span> <span id="s312">No you haven't been in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: I have.</span> <span id="s314">Not that much, but I've been to France.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: Oh, you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: I've

Sol(ph) in Spain and then we went to Portugal.</span> <span id="s323">And so we were free and oh we started to have a correspondence, to go to, have an affidavit to go to America, but it was wherever you were born that counted.</span> <span id="s324">Now I could go right away, but my husband was born in Poland, and I didn't want to go alone, so I stayed.</span> <span id="s325">So we came to America in 1950.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: Well now, let me ask you a little bit more about the whole, all of the places that you stayed and the time that you were really hiding.</span> <span id="s327">How many years was that that you were hiding?</span> <span id="s328">Was it from like 1940 to 1944, or was it that long?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: Yeah, sure it was.</span> <span id="s330">19, no, this invitation was for August '42, 1942, from 1942 . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: Yeah, I thought this would have been later, right.</span> <span id="s332">So where were

<p><span id="s335">Q: So you got back from . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: We went to family camp and then.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: The family, and what was, talk a little bit about,

Belgium.</span> <span id="s343">And everybody had to work, whatever you was able to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: And this is after you had gone towards Paris and turned around?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: No, no, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s346">That was from 1939 until 1940 when the Germans came, because we were there without Germans luckily, for two years.</span> <span id="s347">The Germans only came in in 1940, and we went to Belgium in, no we came, '39 we went to Belgium in January and the war started in September that same year, so there were no Germans when we, otherwise, why should we go where there are Germans, anyway?</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: So then when you turned around, going to France and then you turned around and came back to Belgium, when was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: That was in 1940, when the Germans invaded Belgium and France.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: Okay, so then from 1940 to 1942, before you got this quote unquote invitation.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: Yeah, we were free and then we went to that camp because we were not allowed to work, in Marneff(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: Oh, but I thought you were in Marneff(ph) in '39?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: No, 19, wait a minute, yes we were there in '39, and one day the war was declared between Germany and Belgium and the boss of that family camp said to my husband, he was an announcer in the dining room, as I told you and he said, don't say that word war, and then we left, from the family camp, in a group, where all the other Belgium and Jewish, everybody fled, wanted to go to Paris, which was not yet occupied by the Germans then, but they got there before we got there.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: So who was the person who said to you, if you ever get an invitation like this?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: He was a friend of not a friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: Was that Mrs. Bellhay(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: Oh, yeah, Mr. and Mrs. Belay(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: Belay(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: Belay(ph), yeah, and he, it so happened he

Belays(ph) took you to the Boeskays(ph), is that how it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: And the Belays(ph) bought you the steak dinner?</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: Yeah, and they took off the stars and said if they catch you on the bus, okay, bad luck, you would have to go anyway and I don't know you, you don't know me, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: And then you ended up at the Boeskays(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: And this would have been in 1940 maybe?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: No, still in 19, no, no.</span> <span id="s374">No, no, it was '42, because that . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: Let's look at this, I think there's a date on there.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: Yeah, I told you it's was 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: Where is it?</span> <span id="s378">I think maybe it's on the other side, the date.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: No, it must be, oh yeah here, yeah, I told you, I thought that it was August the second, it was August the first, 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s381">Now, so this original synopsis that I have of this conversation, that's incorrect, because it says 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: No, because I didn't have this paper in Brussels with me, but now I saw, if you come and get everything together, yeah, yeah see.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: 1942, so between, you lived in Marneff(ph) before you went to France, walked to France, or after?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: We walked from Marneff(ph) _______________.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: You walked from Marneff(ph) towards Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: Everybody in that camp, we walked, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: Right, and then you turned around, and then, but then you would have come back in 1939 or 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: So, it was two years that you were living in Brussels?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: Yeah, we were quite free because the Germans invaded Brussels in May '40.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: So between May '40 and August '42, weren't you living in fear?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: Yes, well you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: But you didn't have to hide?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: No, we didn't have to hide, but we had to wear the star, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: Because I, you know, just from all of these things that I've read, about the scrubbing squads, where the Jews had to scrub the streets.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: Oh, that was in Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: That was in Vienna, okay, well I'm sorry, I was, now I'm _______________.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: And that, yeah, I forgot, no I forgot to tell you something.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: We need to go back and talk a little bit about that as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: Yeah, okay, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: Let me . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: Yeah, everybody had to scrub the streets and they took me and my husband at the time, he had the Polish citizenship and then we didn't have to scrub because we were Polish citizens, and my husband drove a car near the, it's an ____________ and that's the Polish flag, so nothing happened to him.</span> <span id="s403">But then he had a customer and he went in that store and the Germans came and said we need some Jews for the camp, in the store.</span> <span id="s404">My husband was with the back to them, and he said, Jack, why don't you go in my office and they were protecting him, he was very lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: So, I also wanted to ask you about, in Vienna, before the _______________, there was the Anschluss.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: Oh, the Anschluss was . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: What's your recollection of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: There was, on March '38, and it was from '38, from March until, well it was terrible, I told you on the benches, no Jews allowed and the women _______________ the stores and it was very, very bad.</span> <span id="s409">People had to wash the streets and they stood around laughing.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: Now you describe growing up as a child not being exposed to anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s411">Were you aware that it existed in the world, that some people didn't like Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: There was a mayor once, long, long ago, I don't know, not in my time, he was with the government and he said, who's a Jew?</span> <span id="s413">I'm going to say who's a Jew.</span> <span id="s414">It was only in politics, not the people.</span> <span id="s415">But then Austria lost the war and there were a lot of unemployed people, so where ever there, the Socialists, saw that it's going to be better, so they were Socialists, and they set the Parliament on fire once, long before Hitler and then they said, okay when we have Hitler, we'll be happy, we'll live happy ever after because they were poor, they had no jobs and the women of course, the Viennese are terrible.</span> <span id="s416">Very, very bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: But do you think that suddenly, these feelings they had inside them of not liking Jews were suddenly let loose?</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: Yeah, because when Hitler came to Vienna, there was a shortage of onions, they said sure, the Jews like onions, the Jews ate the onions, that's why we didn't have onions.</span> <span id="s419">Women you know have nothing to do with politics.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: Now, but as, you were still, you were not a child any more when this happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: No, I was 28.</span> <span id="s422">When we left I was married for four years.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: At the same time you were young enough to probably, if you had, if you had believed that people were fair minded, this whole arrival of Anschluss and then of course, the ________________, it must have been a shock to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: Of course it was a terrible shock, but we're, Hitler came the first night and I wanted to leave right away, but my mother still had a job and my husband had a job and my brother was in the first World War, he was a captain in the Austrian army and he got _______________ medal.</span> <span id="s425">Nothing is going to happen to me, he said, I was in the war.</span> <span id="s426">You can't imagine, you don't believe it.</span> <span id="s427">Look, in Germany, it never happened like this, because why didn't Jewish people come from Germany in '32, when Hitler came in '32 and they were right next door and look.</span> <span id="s428">We _______________, we just didn't believe that it could happen to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: When you left, did you think that you were leaving for good, or did you have a dream to come back?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: You know, at this moment, I don't know, you don't think, you couldn't think, otherwise you would get crazy.</span> <span id="s431">I don't know.</span> <span id="s432">You can't.</span> <span id="s433">If you would think, you would just get crazy.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: So that the way to survive is to just put one foot in front of the other?</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: Yeah, we were just thinking where to go and how to go.</span> <span id="s436">So we had no other possibility, so we went illegally to Belgium and we were lucky they didn't send us back.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: And you didn't talk about, what's happening to us, why are they doing to us, or did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s439">It was terrible, of course.</span> <span id="s440">And after the _______________, and yeah, and then we went to Belgium, and we could have let my mother come to Belgium because we had that man who really was nice to us, the person, man who went to school with my husband's father.</span> <span id="s441">And at the frontier, we could have gone in Belgium to the frontier and really, and my mother said nothing is going to happen to me, I'm old, I have a pension.</span> <span id="s442">You don't believe it.</span> <span id="s443">You couldn't believe it, you wouldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s444">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s445">And on the way back you know, from France, we saw things spread all over, the people could take as much as they could carry, and cameras, you name it, everything in the world, terrible.</span> <span id="s446">Beautiful things, nobody picked it up because.</span> <span id="s447">I had a gold bracelet, was nothing to it, but we always had cigarettes to smoke on the _______________.</span> <span id="s448">Which is the reason why I have had an operation on my veins because it didn't get in on the lungs, but in my veins.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: The idea of hiding . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: You know, on the one hand you have people who are risking their lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: Yeah, I ask them . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: And on the other hand, there's just this terrible injustice that you have to hide, so that it must be like this . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: Injustice.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: Well, I don't even know . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: It's an injustice they came on the ________________ too and took everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: Of course, I'm just, I wanted to just ask you a little bit, I guess two things, two things.</span> <span id="s458">Do you recall how you felt during those days when you were hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: We never knew when the bell rang whether it was the Gestapo or the milkman and you had not too much to eat, so.</span> <span id="s460">One man was very stingy, was _______________, do you have that too?</span> <span id="s461">He was a mining engineer and they had the key to the freezer house where the meat was, the Germans, so one day they went in to ____________ and they stole pigs, two pigs.</span> <span id="s462">Do you have that?</span> <span id="s463">Did I tell that that lady too?</span> <span id="s464">So everybody got ham and we ate pig for two weeks, the main ____________ got and everybody, the whole street and we were hidden across from a German, you know where the Germans lived and one day the whole street was closed and I think some high officer came from Germany, and they said it was the best to be hidden across from where the Germans lived, because they didn't suspect that there were Jews there.</span> <span id="s465">It was at _______________.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: You were right across from the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s468">It was very, very bad.</span> <span id="s469">And look, you _______________, any day they come and get you, you live with the fact that that's what it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: And at the same time, if this went on for a couple of years, you must have developed into some kind of routine.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: No, you never do, I don't think we did.</span> <span id="s472">No, we were just, you know, shit happens, it happens.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: Were you always scared all the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: No.</span> <span id="s475">You don't . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: Did you get bored sometimes?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: Bored, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: Not bored either.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s480">They were really, really nice to us, the people who were hiding us and maybe it wasn't so much the love of the Jews, but the hate against the Germans because they had them in the first World War too, the Germans and I think they were much worse to the whole population then, terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: Do you think that there may have also been some, was there something about, you know, just reaching out to another human being that was in their motivation?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: What else do you think motivated them to help these different families, to help you?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: Well, they were good people.</span> <span id="s485">When they said, we're going to hide you, I said, you hardly know us and we ____________ because we just bought cigarettes there.</span> <span id="s486">So I said, what if they send you to jail?</span> <span id="s487">But they hated them so much, and it was an English spy, and we took the messages from the BBC, the _________________ means, the route is, how do you call it?</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: Long and winding?</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: Winding, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: The route is long and winding, what did that mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: The next day they bombed in Germany.</span> <span id="s492">I don't know what it meant.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: But there was a message over the . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: There was a message over the radio and the next day they were bombing a factory over there in Germany, so, important things.</span> <span id="s495">You just live from one day to the other and if it happens, it happens.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: Were you ever surprised by the courage or the commitment of the people who housed you?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: Yeah, I just told you, I told them right away, why do you hide us, they're going to put you in jail or they kill you, oh no, no.</span> <span id="s498">Their hate was so big against the Germans that they would do anything, anything to, oh yeah, on the street, between '39 and '40, they're all sent in the wrong directions, the Germans, so one German said to the other in German, be careful, they send us the wrong way.</span> <span id="s499">We understood, you know, we understood German.</span> <span id="s500">And that George Millot(ph), he went with two bums on the public transportation, the tramway(ph).</span> <span id="s501">They, right next to a German.</span> <span id="s502">There was such hate for the Germans that they, terrible, they burned holes in their uniforms with cigarettes.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: So they were, in a sense, a part of the Belgian resistance.</span> <span id="s504">Was there much contact, or was it . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: Not only Belgian, _______________ in France and in Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: And how much did they have a connection with the committee for the defense of the Jews?</span> <span id="s507">Was that related at all, I mean, I've been reading a little bit about the CDJ, you know, the _______________.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: Yeah, well that's it, we had, they knew there were Jews and they knew all the names and that's, because this, delivered through the Jews community.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: So the CDJ was basically the connection between, that's how you got to be with these people, through the CDJ?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: But see, yeah, in Vienna, I think in Germany too, it's a law that all the Jews have to register in the Jewish community and that they took over in Belgium too, because look, so this day, delivered through the Jewish Committee.</span> <span id="s511">I told you the native Jews in Brussels, nobody knew they were Jewish and then in our passport, they had a J, Jewish, if you had a passport.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: Now when you were staying, the place that you stayed, the last place you stayed was at the . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: Madame Boeskay(ph) again, we went back.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: Boeskay(ph), okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: We were sitting in the kitchen and Paris is free, oh my God, that was beautiful.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: And was Monsieur Boeskay(ph) killed for . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: No, he wasn't killed, not Monsieur Boeskay(ph), no.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: Oh, then I was thinking of somebody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: No, Millot(ph) was killed and his son came back from the concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: And yeah, Bernard Hubec(ph) for awhile, had to hide himself and he went in a little village near, yeah he put a gun near the river and made them _______________, and that he killed himself, that he went in the river, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: He pretended, he faked it?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: This is Bernard Hubec(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: Yeah, Bernard Hubec(ph).</span> <span id="s526">But he was hidden himself because he belonged, he was a spy, so his wife went to visit him every week there and after the war he had a hard time to get a life again, because he was dead for the community, for the you know, do you have that too, maybe?</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s529">So he had hard time to get to make himself a life again, which makes sense, because in the paper it says he killed himself and they found, they really believed it, even the Belgian people believed it.</span> <span id="s530">They found the gun and he was hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: Do you remember the story, you would have been in hiding then, in 1943, of train number 20?</span> <span id="s532">The train from Mecklin(ph) to Auschwitz, that was derailed, I don't know if it was derailed but there was a story of the Belgian resistance, it was a train going to the death camps that was stopped.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: I'm just . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: I didn't tell it.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: No, no, you didn't tell it, I was just wondering if you, that was one of the stories of some of the . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: I know another story, I know, they all knew that, from Mecklin(ph), they all went to Auschwitz, they knew it, that they went to their deaths, they all knew it and there was a couple, a girl and a young man and they both jumped from the train and thought if we die, we die and they got married.</span> <span id="s538">That's how they met each other, on that train, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: Both jumping off?</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: Were you aware of, how aware were you, I guess, of what was going on outside while you were . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: Oh no, there was a condition, one condition that they would hide us, nobody, but nobody knew we were hidden and I could write to my brother who lived in a, not too far away from Brussels, with his non-Jewish wife and he did not, he got the mail but he didn't know where we were, because he could, you know, _______________, nobody knew we were hidden there.</span> <span id="s543">I told you how relatives didn't know that they had somebody.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">End of Tape 1</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Tape 2</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: . . . never went to anyone.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: But, were you aware of what was going on outside?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: Yes of course, oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: Through the BBC?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: No, through, they were, the whole family was _______________, there was a woman, she was related and she went with the children's transport, going to France to save the Jewish transport, we knew that.</span> <span id="s551">And then she called and said, you better don't go out, they have a bad cold, but she meant _______________ on the street they took the people, and I was working with a girl, she was Jewish, but she was blonde, blue-eyed, they came to her apartment, the Gestapo, they wanted to take her and she said, oh my God, what do you want of me, I'm not Jewish and they left.</span> <span id="s552">That's something to do, you know.</span> <span id="s553">You have to be, you had to be brave and you had, you know, just live, that's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: Because at the time, I mean people were like 10 or 12 people a day were being taken off the street at this time, right, it must have been incredibly terrifying.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: I know, and there was an officer and they said he went, it was a man and he said, there's a Jew, there's a Jew and they took him in the Jeep or whatever it was, you never saw that man or woman again, and I think I saw them once.</span> <span id="s556">Looked at me, they looked back at ____.</span> <span id="s557">Or I was really like dressed long and no make-up and they didn't think I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s558">Just that had to have luck and you just lived in the day and what's tomorrow and it's just, I guess if somebody has cancer, that's how it must feel.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: And while you were in hiding, you obviously couldn't have any contact with your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: No, I just told you, there was one condition.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: I know.</span> <span id="s562">And I'm just wondering, because of that, were you wondering about your family in Vienna all the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: Of course.</span> <span id="s564">My mother didn't want to go, I told you she had a pension and I'm old, nothing is going to happen.</span> <span id="s565">You couldn't believe it, just couldn't believe it, that's it.</span> <span id="s566">And then, yeah, she's in that book and my mother-in-law is in that book and my sister.</span> <span id="s567">And one sister survived, she was in ________________ during the war I think.</span> <span id="s568">She came to America, but she died in 1974 I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: Are you able to talk about your mother and your sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: Yeah, well, maybe sad to talk.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: Yeah, after the war we wrote to the Red Cross to inquire about my mother and my sister, when ________________ and the Red Cross told us they went to ________________ for two years and then they took them further away and sorry, we have no, we have a list of the survivors and my mother and my sister's not on it.</span> <span id="s573">It says in this book.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: ________________ is?</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: ________________ was one of the same, beautiful camp, because the Germans they knew from, in America, that the Germans were very bad and they gassed the people, so they showed, they took the Germans to ________________ to show them what a beautiful camp it was, and it seemed everything was nice there, but they didn't stay forever, they took them, it says in that book, to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: They took them from ________________ to Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: Yeah, and there was some poets in ________________ and music and you know, always if the Red Cross made an inspection, everything was just fine, but I'm sure the Germans knew what was going on, because they lived around there.</span> <span id="s578">They must have known.</span> <span id="s579">And then so many people denied that it ever happened, you know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: Still they are today.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: Now, sure, of course.</span> <span id="s582">_______________, I'm afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: You think so?</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: Why do you say that?</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: They have the skinheads and the yeah.</span> <span id="s587">Look, we never dreamed in Austria that it would happen to us and we were, I don't know, 40 miles from Germany.</span> <span id="s588">Were we stupid or what?</span> <span id="s589">I don't know.</span> <span id="s590">And it happened.</span> <span id="s591">No, really, I wanted to leave right away when I saw them, I loved Vienna, I was born there, my mother was born there, but I, I just knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: How do you think of Vienna now?</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: It's a beautiful city, we went back.</span> <span id="s594">No, there was a time, I was dreaming I had to go back to Vienna and I woke up crying, and never, I could never be, no, I still wouldn't live in Vienna now.</span> <span id="s595">No but, I mean then, I wouldn't go back, not for a second.</span> <span id="s596">And one day we were in Zurich in Switzerland, from America, you know, just traveling, and I said, listen, let's just go there, out of our minds if we came for one week and just go there as a tourist, and that's the first time we went back to Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: This was in '86, did you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: No, no, '86, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: Oh, that was the last time I guess you were back you said.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: I'm sorry, when was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: Oh, that was much earlier, I don't know when. '</span> <span id="s603">72?</span> <span id="s604">I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: So it was quite a while, you were gone for 30 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s607">And then we went in a group, in fact it was a Jewish group, it was the B'Nai B'rith, maybe you heard about it, and the group was through the B'Nai B'rith, they were all Jewish of course, these people were, mostly Americans, and when I saw young people, young people from Vienna, it didn't bother me, because they weren't alive when Hitler was, they were born after the war, but when I saw some people my age, it was, and then, you know, they're always, Viennese are, were always famous for complaining.</span> <span id="s608">And then we went another time to Vienna, and we're standing waiting for bus, and they said, you're terrible now, there are no Jews to complain about, but there were some people from all over, from Czechoslovakia, like now in America from, they come from Mexico, illegal.</span> <span id="s609">Yeah, they're bad, and oh, you know, ____________ my age, they are fat, they look terrible and they are mean.</span> <span id="s610">We were sitting in the street car, there was a young man, he was Viennese, he was Christian, I don't know what he was, there was a woman, I just sit there, like in a movie.</span> <span id="s611">Terrible, terrible, terrible.</span> <span id="s612">Oh, we have some friends, they're not Jewish, he was a professor in Vienna, the University, he came to America to teach at Harvard and oh he left, he made fun of the Viennese, he said, if you want to be a full professor in Vienna, you have to wait until that one dies, so he went back to his friends, the University in 19- I don't know when, he made $75,000, which was much a lot then.</span> <span id="s613">They wouldn't believe him, you know.</span> <span id="s614">No, I will never live, ever never live in Europe again, ever.</span> <span id="s615">It's beautiful, but.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: Too many bad memories?</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: No, bad memories of course, but there's only one, oh and my son is real, real, oh my God, they say there's only one country in the whole world, it's America, because you can be, and you do what you want in America, you can be what you want and you can move from state to state.</span> <span id="s618">If you went to Bosnia, had to have a passport in Europe, talk the different language.</span> <span id="s619">I went to Paris and don't go there if you don't speak the language, because you'll get gypped, really.</span> <span id="s620">Went to Paris and they wanted to buy music in box to take as souvenir to America, and ask, I was American, I talked English and she went in the, I said, how much is this, the woman said, went in the back room, how much is this for American in French, so she come back to _______________ and no merci beaucoups ________________ and _______________ just said, thank you.</span> <span id="s621">Well in the big department store, you get so many percentage off and it's _______________.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: I wanted to ask you one other question about just how you felt at the time, if I may.</span> <span id="s623">I know it's difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: I don't know how, honestly I don't know, I just lived from day to day, and what's tomorrow.</span> <span id="s625">They take, so they take me, so.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: I guess I wanted to ask that maybe this wasn't something you thought about at the time, and maybe you've thought about it since then, but the question I wanted to ask was, and this is a difficult question to ask, so please . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: So, go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: But, did you ever think about why me, to have the fortune to survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: No, I was very grateful and I always, of course we were glad to be here, just lucky.</span> <span id="s630">Very lucky, really.</span> <span id="s631">But you, there is not such a thing as being afraid.</span> <span id="s632">I guess all these people in the concentration camp, even they weren't afraid, because they said, what will be, will be and really, it's all I can say.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q: Did you stay in contact with the Boeskays(ph), or?</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A: Oh yeah, sure.</span> <span id="s635">Madame Boeskay(ph) died and he died of, he had a lot to do with his stomach, he died of cancer and then.</span> <span id="s636">Yeah, one granddaughter came to America and met my son in New York and she got the job in Texas.</span> <span id="s637">Well, they all speak English of course, very good, very fluently English, everybody in Europe does.</span> <span id="s638">If they say they don't it's not true, because, well I learned French in school, I was the best in the class and when I came to Belgium I wanted to buy a candle, so I didn't know French then, so I looked in the dictionary and there were two words for candle, ________________ de _______________, and I said the wrong thing, _______________ is for the church, and the grocery store, they didn't know what a _______________ was, so he didn't know, so I drew him some matches, I drew him the candle, so he said, what you want, matches, you know.</span> <span id="s639">Oh, you know then, oh, on the way back to Brussels from France, we stayed in the country and there was a stupid man, how do you say that, stupid man, he was, everybody was gone, only he was there, in the ____________ house, so my husband took over, he milked the cow, and he was grinding things, corn to make bread and so there were two Englishmen coming back and so they took over, they had just on the coffee mill, they drowned.</span> <span id="s640">And then the German soldiers came and they said we want eggs, in German, we didn't understand, we said we didn't understand German, what?</span> <span id="s641">So they said to the other one, she knows what we're saying, she doesn't want to give us any, you know, you always had to enjoy whatever we had and the next day, it's the next day, that's it and somehow you get the strength, if not, you really get crazy.</span> <span id="s642">I guess you have to be strong a little bit, I don't know.</span> <span id="s643">And I was always together with my husband and whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: Boy that must have made a tremendous difference for both of you.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: To be going through this together, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: Oh, they finally got the affidavit to come to America, we were supposed to go with the Il de France, and that was in strike, so we had to fly.</span> <span id="s648">Now we flew in January, in 1950, and there was only a propeller, no jet, and there was a snowstorm in New York and we couldn't land in New York, so we had to land in Washington, DC., so the ticket counter, there was a line of us standing in line to get a ticket back from Washington DC.</span> <span id="s649">to New York, where our relatives waited.</span> <span id="s650">Everybody looked at me, they were all black people then, in 1950 still.</span> <span id="s651">I was the only white, I didn't realize, why does the people look at me?</span> <span id="s652">And then on the train, we took the train back, that's when we made our first $76, I remember.</span> <span id="s653">He said, how do you want to go, we pay your freight, do you want a sleeper, or do you want a regular seat ____________ Washington DC.</span> <span id="s654">to New York, so I said, no regular, so we got $76 back.</span> <span id="s655">So we got the airport, no, Grand Central Station, because there was a train, so my husband called his cousin who gave us the affidavit.</span> <span id="s656">He said, yeah, I'll be there in an hour, he lived in Brighton Beach, so my husband said to him, takes you so long?</span> <span id="s657">That's where I live, that's what it takes, an hour.</span> <span id="s658">Oh, my God.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: And after living in, did you stay in Belgium then, from '45 to '50?</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: Yeah, yeah, I told you I was in the officer's shop and my husband was at _______________.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: For all of those five years?</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: Uh-huh, and was it a shock to live in America then, after that, I mean Brighton Beach from Europe is quite a change there.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: No, oh, no, oh no, my God, you know where we lived?</span> <span id="s665">On the lower east side in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: Oh, whereabouts _______________?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: 30 Cannon Street, we went back one day and it doesn't exist any more, that street.</span> <span id="s668">Off Delancy Street, you know where that is?</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: Right by Orchard Street and ____?</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: Yeah right, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: Sure, I know that area.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: Oh, it was dirty, and Henry, Henry was never sick, I washed his hands with cologne, and I'm the one that touched him when he was little and I said oh it's _______________, it's dirty and he got his first German measles, he was never sick.</span> <span id="s673">But, and
