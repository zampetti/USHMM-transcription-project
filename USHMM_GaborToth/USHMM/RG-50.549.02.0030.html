Laub.</span> <span id="s18">This is a few seconds of silence in Frima Laub’s home.</span> <span id="s19">There is, in the background, all sorts of, I guess wind blowers.</span> <span id="s20">They are -- It’s a beautiful fall day and neighbors are taking the opportunity to clean off the leaves.</span> <span id="s21">So, we are starting, along with the lawn material, which we will forget about.</span> <span id="s22">I wanted to ask you first, Frima, if you could give me your full name as a child and the name of each of your immediate family members and just a little bit about them.</span> <span id="s23">Maybe where you all were at first.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Answer: When you say at first, at first before World War Two, or during World War Two?</span> <span id="s25">Okay, my name is Frima.</span> <span id="s26">Maiden name was Glaser.</span> <span id="s27">We used Glaser-Better, B-e-t-t-e-r.</span> <span id="s28">My mother’s name is Eta, my father’s name was Mayer, M-a-y-e-r.</span> <span id="s29">My brother’s name is David, my sister’s name is Jeannie.</span> <span id="s30">You said you wanted to know more about --</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: A little bit about where you lived before the war and what he did and --</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s33">Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s34">Okay, before the war, we live in a very lovely city, by the name of Volachisk -- I’m sorry, not Volachisk, Proscurov, which is near Volachisk and Potvolachisk, where the rest of my relatives were born.</span> <span id="s35">Some were born in Volachisk, some were born in Potvolachisk.</span> <span id="s36">But, we moved when I was still a little girl.</span> <span id="s37">We moved to Proscurov, which is a larger city.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: In the Ukraine?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: And it was in the Ukraine, right and that’s not too far from Kiev.</span> <span id="s40">Okay?</span> <span id="s41">We had the home there, of course.</span> <span id="s42">My mother was a housewife, my father was in the import and export -- actually mostly export, meat export business.</span> <span id="s43">My brother was studying in Kiev, in the engineering school and my sister was going to school in Proscurov.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: We did --</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: We-We’ll -- We’ll return later to your relationship with your -- your family members, but first, I wanted to ask you some of the things, just to clear up from the 1990 interview that was done at the Holocaust Museum.</span> <span id="s47">Did you have any idea of what year it was, or how old you were when you first stayed alone with the Gentile woman?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: Yes, that was in 1942, after the second pogrom in Proscurov.</span> <span id="s49">This is where -- My mother felt that she had to leave the city, of course, with my sister -- at that time, we didn’t know where m -- our father was.</span> <span id="s50">And my brother, of course, we didn’t know where he was, since he was in Kiev, since before the war -- the war started.</span> <span id="s51">So, that was after the second pogrom, when my mother felt everybody was killed in the city and she had to run away because they were searching for remaining Jews.</span> <span id="s52">So, that’s when she left me with that Gentile lady.</span> <span id="s53">So, I was six years old, little bit over six, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: And I had a question -- two questions, actually, the first one being, do you know -- do you understand now and did you understand then, why your mother left you alone?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: It’s such a interesting question.</span> <span id="s56">Did I understand?</span> <span id="s57">I -- Obviously, I must have understood something when she said, “You have to stay here.</span> <span id="s58">I must leave with your sister.</span> <span id="s59">But,” she said, “in the spring, someone will come to get you and bring you to me, wherever I’m going to be.”</span> <span id="s60">A-And as much as I didn’t like the thought that my mother was leaving, a-and I was, you know, I was crying and my excuse was, “Mama,” I says, “but I have a headache.”</span> <span id="s61">Cause I felt, maybe if I tell her I have a headache, she will stay.</span> <span id="s62">And she said to me, she said, “The lady will give you an aspirin, and you’ll feel better.</span> <span id="s63">And here.”</span> <span id="s64">She gave me a hundred rubles, she says, “In case you want to buy yourself something and you need money.”</span> <span id="s65">So she gave me the hundred rubles and she kissed me goodbye, she walked out.</span> <span id="s66">Now -- She walked out, I -- I guess there was something that I must have understood when she said, “I must go, and I can’t take you along,” she says, “because it is too cold outside.”</span> <span id="s67">And -- And i-in Europe, the winters are extremely cold.</span> <span id="s68">You can really freeze.</span> <span id="s69">And -- And I had very little clothing, because that clothing wasn’t even mine, it was the clothing that belonged to somebody else from the first pogrom yet.</span> <span id="s70">So, I guess, in the way, I understood that it’s cold outside and I might get sick or freeze and my mother said she must leave and I knew one thing, that, as a Jew, we had to escape.</span> <span id="s71">So, that was my understanding, and I didn’t make a scene.</span> <span id="s72">I just said, “My head hurts.”</span> <span id="s73">That’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: Now, the part two of the question that I wanted to ask that I would -- while I was watching the video, that I wondered -- now, to step way back into the -- well, way up into the future from that moment, did you ever discuss this with your mother, about leaving?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: Interesting.</span> <span id="s76">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: Never discussed it and I never, ever felt any resentment.</span> <span id="s79">As the years went by, I guess somebody would say, “Oh, Ma, you left me.”</span> <span id="s80">or “You abandoned me.”</span> <span id="s81">I never felt that way.</span> <span id="s82">And I just never discussed it with her and I -- but I did asked her, when we were reunited and she held me on her lap -- see, now I remem -- I remember, and my first question was, “Mama, why did you leave me?”</span> <span id="s83">That I did, yeah.</span> <span id="s84">And she just explained to me again what she said, “I had to leave, it was too cold and I was afraid if I take you, you might freeze to death.”</span> <span id="s85">Cause even the clothe -- my clothing consisted of knee-highs and a pair of short boots.</span> <span id="s86">A little skirt, a sweater and a little jacket with a scarf, that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: And your sister was much older than you?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: 10 years older.</span> <span id="s89">Right, she was already a big girl, so that was different.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: And speaking of the reunion with your mother and your sister.</span> <span id="s91">Where -- In the interview -- we are not quite clear from the video interview, what were the conditions, where did you live, did you work?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: W-We lived in this very, very small town, it was occupied Romania and I understand this was still part of the Ukraine, but it was next to Romania and they call it occupied Romania.</span> <span id="s93">Mostly, there was a handful of Gentile people with a few homes, and -- a-and farms -- fields, they had a lot of fields.</span> <span id="s94">And this handful of Jewish people lived with the Gentile families, like we did.</span> <span id="s95">We lived with this Gentile gentleman.</span> <span id="s96">We were two families in one of his rooms, because that’s all he had is one room.</span> <span id="s97">And -- And he slept on top of the brick oven and we had -- yeah, our life wasn’t that simple.</span> <span id="s98">There was no bathrooms, either.</span> <span id="s99">If you had to go to the bathroom, you had to go out in the fields.</span> <span id="s100">Those days, things were not the way they are today.</span> <span id="s101">And so there was one bed, on -- on that bed there was a mother and a daughter whose fingers were a bit froze -- yeah, frozen from -- from the cold -- yeah, from the cold weather.</span> <span id="s102">They were trying to hide and wherever they hid, they obviously were not dressed properly.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: A Jewish mother and --</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: Yeah, a Jewish mother and a Jew -- and her daughter.</span> <span id="s105">So, they slept on one -- it wasn’t really a bed, it was one of those four legs and -- a-a-and -- and some hay on it, I mean, that was the bed.</span> <span id="s106">And we had another bed, which was a little bit bigger, because my mother, myself, my sister and then later on, a cousin of ours joined us, too.</span> <span id="s107">So we all slept on the same bed and instead of sleeping horizontally, we slept diagonally.</span> <span id="s108">And if there wasn’t enough room, so one of us will sleep on the floor.</span> <span id="s109">A-And that was o-our quarters.</span> <span id="s110">Now, what we did is -- is -- we had no money to pay for our -- our rent.</span> <span id="s111">So, we worked for this gentleman.</span> <span id="s112">Of course, we were very grateful, the fact that he even gave us a place where to sleep -- where to sleep.</span> <span id="s113">So, we worked on his -- on his fields and I was one of his workers, and my job was to -- with my fingers, I would have to dig out the potatoes from -- you know, from under the earth.</span> <span id="s114">And I cleaned them up, put them in a sack and tied the sack and then, you know, just so -- drag it to his warehouse, which I don’t know how many blocks it was exactly, I never counted it.</span> <span id="s115">To me, it was just part of my life.</span> <span id="s116">And for that, he would give me a loaf of black bread.</span> <span id="s117">So, we didn’t have to pay for the rent and he gave me a loaf of bread and that was a tremendous salary.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: How often did you get bread?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: Well, every day.</span> <span id="s120">I wor -- I worked every day.</span> <span id="s121">And so did, of course, my sister and my mother and my cousin.</span> <span id="s122">We all worked for him.</span> <span id="s123">Well, they -- they worked in different parts of the field and I worked, you know, digging up the potatoes with my hands, my bare hands, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: Do you remember what -- what -- what they did?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: What -- I’m sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: What your mother and sister did?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: Oh, they were also working on the fields.</span> <span id="s128">Well, they must have -- they -- may -- may -- maybe they did different, you know, diggings, different, whatchamacallit, vegetables, you know, also it was -- everything was digging up, you know, because like he did the seeding and then, you know, y -- and you would have to -- in the springtime, that’s what you did.</span> <span id="s129">In springtime, everything was growing and you had to rip it off of, or rip it out of the ground and bring it into his warehouse.</span> <span id="s130">So we were all just working on the fields.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: But you were not in hiding at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: No.</span> <span id="s133">At that time, it was not a question of hiding, because there was no ghetto, this was not a ghetto.</span> <span id="s134">You wo -- just would have to be very careful if sometimes a German would pass by in the street, you understand?</span> <span id="s135">Or -- Or someone, some other Gentile would know that you were Jewish, he might just go to the German and tell them, you know, in this house, they have Jews.</span> <span id="s136">So, actually, we were hiding out and nobody was supposed to know that we are Jews, except for the person with whom we lived, he knew that we were Jewish.</span> <span id="s137">So, that’s how it worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: Was he -- What would have been his motivation, was -- was it political, was it -- was it a spiritual motivation?</span> <span id="s139">Was it circumstantial?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: To say -- Do you mean to hol -- to hide out Jews?</span> <span id="s141">Well, there were some good people and he must have been one of those people wh-wh -- who felt sorry for a mother and her children and he also felt, you know, that we’ll be devoted and loyal.</span> <span id="s142">We’ll -- We’ll work for him, we’ll help him out, because after all, he was all alone.</span> <span id="s143">And at the same time, he was, you know, saving lives.</span> <span id="s144">And that’s -- That was really something very, very amazing and very important to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: That sort of reminds me a -- a little bit of what I’m reading about the -- the slaves in America and how there were certain homes, when they were on their way from the south to the north --</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: Took them in.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: -- where they stayed, I wondered, just jumping way into the future, did you have a -- make a connection with the Civil Rights movement at all, or the story of slavery in America?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: You mean, at the present time, connecting their past and my past?</span> <span id="s149">Well, you know, in those years, in my -- my times -- you’re talking 55 years ago, there was no such thing as Civil Rights, there wa-was only such a thing as good people versing not such good people.</span> <span id="s150">And he was one of those top people, who -- all he knew was perhaps for -- because of his belief, that God said, you know, you should help others and that’s what he was doing.</span> <span id="s151">And the mere fact that he took us in, he must have been very special and -- and -- and obviously a believer too, in saving lives.</span> <span id="s152">So, you know, things were different then, as they are today, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: Do you have any idea how your mother found him?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: No, but I am sure my mother was something very special.</span> <span id="s155">She was someone who was always ahead of everyone.</span> <span id="s156">And I imagine she just found out abis -- about this gentleman that, you know, lived alone and she must have approached him and -- and offered, you know, our services and he accepted them.</span> <span id="s157">So we are very lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: Now, from there I would love to -- whoa.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: That’s the airport.</span> <span id="s160">We’re not that far from the airport.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s162">From LaGuardia?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: You see -- no, JFK.</span> <span id="s164">You hear that noise?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: Every time -- This is not too bad, but every time, could be in the morning, could be during the day, could be in the evening, suddenly there will be a tr-tremendous noise coming from the airport and I think it’s from the airport, from that direction, and that will bring horrible memories to me and I sometimes just shake and I can’t do anything until this noise stops.</span> <span id="s167">That reminds me, after the liberation, when we came back to Proscurov, to our home, every night for a whole year, until ‘45, the German planes, 30 or 40 of them would come over every night and bombard the city.</span> <span id="s168">And so, we would hear that noise, f-from those planes approaching us and then, of course, either we -- if we had enough time, we would run to shelters and if we didn’t, we would just lie on the floors and -- and our ho -- our glass, you know the windows would be open and we would have tapes on them, that th-the -- the glass should not shatter and we would lie under our beds until they finished bombarding and they left.</span> <span id="s169">This is how I lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: Wa -- That’s interesting that that plane would give us a cue, cause what -- one thing I -- I know we want to know about, is at the exact time of liberation, because you briefly mentioned it in the video interview and later you say that you never really felt liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: And I wondered, for a moment, if we might focus on your experience of the -- the exact moment of liberation are -- are -- and then the few days after that, from a child’s -- how old were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: I was, at that time, eight.</span> <span id="s174">Eight years old, that was in 1944.</span> <span id="s175">And, actually the Russians liberated us, okay, the Russian army.</span> <span id="s176">And there was -- it was really horrible, because for a day and night, there was door to door fighting between the Russian soldiers and -- and the Germans.</span> <span id="s177">And, course the following day, when -- when we realized that we were free, that -- I ran into the house -- to that -- to our room, where that lady with her daughter were and these poor people, you know, their fingers were all frostbitten and well, while they were there, I used to go in the fields and look for a special leaf.</span> <span id="s178">There was a special leaf which, when you would put to the infected area, that at least alleviated their pain.</span> <span id="s179">Cause, you see, we could not get to a doctor and we were not allowed to go to a hospital and nobody was supposed to know that we were Jews.</span> <span id="s180">So, we couldn’t call for help to help that mother and daughter who were constantly in excruciating pain because those -- that area where the fingers fell off, was just closing and half -- it wasn’t completely closed.</span> <span id="s181">So -- So I was told that if I can find those type of leaves in the fields, then they would put it in -- o-on the affect -- in -- affect -- infected area and -- and that would alleviate their pain.</span> <span id="s182">So, I used to do that.</span> <span id="s183">But then, when we were told that we are liberated, we are free, we don’t have to be afraid, well, I ran in -- you know, I was in the street and I ran in to give them the good news.</span> <span id="s184">And I was so happy, I was jumping and this poor lady, now I understand, you know, how she felt.</span> <span id="s185">Then, I couldn’t understand.</span> <span id="s186">She took a broom and she started hitting me.</span> <span id="s187">And she said to me, “What is there to rejoice?”</span> <span id="s188">Because she and her daughter, they were really cripples.</span> <span id="s189">And -- And I was jumping for joy, so she beat me up with a broom.</span> <span id="s190">And she said, “Well, there’s nothing to rejoice about.”</span> <span id="s191">I says, “But we don’t have -- the Germans are gone, the Germans are gone.”</span> <span id="s192">She said, “Oh.</span> <span id="s193">So?”</span> <span id="s194">And that was that, you know, and I just walked out of the house, because I was afraid she will beat me up some more, so that was that.</span> <span id="s195">Then, we also ran to see the first Russian airplane that landed in that -- in our little town.</span> <span id="s196">And it was on the hill and it was very big and I was so happy to see this big plane, because when I was little and I would go with my father for walks and I would see an airplane in the sky and I would say, “Papa, how does this plane fly?”</span> <span id="s197">And he would say, “There is a man in it.”</span> <span id="s198">And I would say, “But it’s so small, how can a person sit in it?”</span> <span id="s199">And he would say to me, “It seems to you that it -- he’s -- this plane is very small.</span> <span id="s200">That’s because this plane is so far, far away.</span> <span id="s201">But it’s really very, very big.”</span> <span id="s202">Well, this was my opportunity to see this big plane on the hill -- course with the -- with the Russian soldiers and -- a-and oh, ar -- that was a sunny day and oh, I was so happy.</span> <span id="s203">And then, we heard that this was the day that the Germans were planning to kill that handful of Jews that were hiding out with the Gentile people.</span> <span id="s204">They had already dug up a ditch for us.</span> <span id="s205">But the Russians came in and never gave them a chance to kill us.</span> <span id="s206">So, i-i-it was a tremendous celebration.</span> <span id="s207">I remember we were just dancing in the street and was just something so very special.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: Did -- The first few days after being liberated, did your life change at all?</span> <span id="s209">Did you continue to be in the -- living in the same place?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: Yeah, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s211">We lived, I -- I think for another couple of weeks in the same place, because A, we had no money to go anyplace, we had nothing.</span> <span id="s212">So, I -- I -- I just wou -- don’t know exactly how my mother got the money.</span> <span id="s213">I think what my mother did is whatever we had, like even the sheets she sold, like if you had them -- we had a sheet and maybe a pillowcase and maybe a blanket.</span> <span id="s214">She must have sold it to the people there and that’s how she got money for us to take a train and go back home.</span> <span id="s215">And so, it’s a few -- was a few weeks later that we went home to Proscurov.</span> <span id="s216">And that was in 1944, April of 1944, spring.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: Before we go too much further, there was one more question which I thought was very interesting and that was, it -- it seemed to me when I -- when I listen to you now and when I heard your video, considering your age, that your recollection, your ability to recall is very, very clear and good and I wondered if -- if your mother ever helped you reconstruct the events that happened during wartime, or have you always remembered clearly, what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: Always remembered clearly.</span> <span id="s219">In fact, whenever I talk about my experience, it’s -- it’s right here.</span> <span id="s220">It’s like I’m watching a movie.</span> <span id="s221">Right in front of me, there’s a screen and I’ll see it all over again.</span> <span id="s222">See, I can tell you how the sky was.</span> <span id="s223">When it was shining, when it wasn’t.</span> <span id="s224">When it was raining.</span> <span id="s225">When we were walking -- the first pogrom when they lined us up and we were walking towards the outside of the city to the slaughterhouse.</span> <span id="s226">It was cloudy, it was drizzling, it was dreary, it was cold and yet, the liberation, it was sunny, the sun was shining, the sky was blue.</span> <span id="s227">I can remember everything.</span> <span id="s228">There just isn’t a thing that I don’t.</span> <span id="s229">And it’s all just in front of me.</span> <span id="s230">Once I talk about it, it’s in front of me.</span> <span id="s231">And not only when I talk about it.</span> <span id="s232">It’s -- My life is like a back -- backlash?</span> <span id="s233">Backflash -- back --</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: Flashback?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: Flashback.</span> <span id="s236">Like, I’ll walk in the street and I’ll see -- I’ll -- I’ll hear a German Shepherd and that’s -- right away, I got back to what has happened to me during those years with the German Shepherds.</span> <span id="s237">When I pass a house that has a -- that looks like -- a little like a barn o-or has a barn in back o-of, that brings back memories again.</span> <span id="s238">So, every movement in my life and everywhere I go, I see my past.</span> <span id="s239">I see a cat, brings back memories.</span> <span id="s240">Even -- That’s just unbelievable, but even, you know, the Germans, the SS, their hats.</span> <span id="s241">They had these caps with like a brim up front, but up front was very high and then they had insignia, the insignia.</span> <span id="s242">Sometimes I’ll see someone with a hat similar to that and it like takes me aback.</span> <span id="s243">Right away, I’ll look at that.</span> <span id="s244">And, like I told you, th-the plane, that noise from the airport, right away I see the planes coming.</span> <span id="s245">God, there’s just -- just about everything brings memories.</span> <span id="s246">But, everything is very, very clear, from the minute that -- when I was in my kindergarten and I was standing by the window, looking out to the backyard and the first bomb fell.</span> <span id="s247">Like a little -- you know, away from our -- from my school, but I was able to see the explosion of it and this is when the teachers realized that we were in trouble and they all called, you know, th-the parents and the parents came running and they took the children home and -- and of course, and on the radio we heard that -- that the Germans invaded us.</span> <span id="s248">So, from that moment on --</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: How old would you have been then?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: Oh, I was five years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s252">I think I better go to side two, because I have a feeling we’re going to have a long story coming in liberation.</span> <span id="s253">So, we’re now moving from tape one, side A, to side B.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: All right, this is tape one of the interview with Frima Laub, side B. And you were saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: And I was saying that, because I was so young and this was such an impact on my life, that although perhaps I could not understand exactly what a war is, but I knew that I must survive.</span> <span id="s257">This I knew.</span> <span id="s258">And I knew that the fact that I am a Jew, nobody’s supposed to know that.</span> <span id="s259">I have to be somebody else.</span> <span id="s260">And, for awhile, as you know, my name was not Frima, it was Lola.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: No, I didn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: No, it was Olga.</span> <span id="s263">I forgot, it was Olga.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: Your name was Olga?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s266">During the war, I was not Frima.</span> <span id="s267">I was -- We had to undertake a different -- different names in order for us to be somebody else.</span> <span id="s268">We were not supposed to be Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: What was your last name?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: Oh, now you are asking me for too much.</span> <span id="s271">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s272">I don’t remember what our last name was, but we did have, believe it or not, we did have false papers, because you were not allowed to walk the street, they were -- we were all so -- the rosaca -- what do we call that?</span> <span id="s273">Curfew?</span> <span id="s274">Curfew, yeah.</span> <span id="s275">A curfew, right, in the evening?</span> <span id="s276">And if anyone was walking, then you had -- an-and ap -- you know, and a German would stop you, which they had the right to do it.</span> <span id="s277">If you show them the papers, then they would let you go.</span> <span id="s278">If you didn’t have papers, they would take you in for interrogations.</span> <span id="s279">So, we had -- we had false papers.</span> <span id="s280">And this all -- My mother took care on all these things.</span> <span id="s281">In fact, we got these papers from a church, from a pastor, because my mother realized, after the pogrom that they are -- or they were looking for Jews and -- and we had no place to go and so that means we would be in the streets, trying to -- you know, like she was trying to -- to see whom and how she would be able to get us where and how to leave the city.</span> <span id="s282">So, we went into a church and my mother spoke with a pastor and he gave us false papers, yeah.</span> <span id="s283">You see, I told you there were some good people in this world.</span> <span id="s284">If not for them, I wouldn’t be here talking to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: I want to ask you about how you got -- if you can recollect, how you got from the knowledge of the liberation, then there was two weeks with the same farmer --</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: Or three weeks --</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: -- and then -- or however --</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: -- and then, do you remember how you traveled and what -- how you felt when you arrived in your next destination?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: Home -- hum.</span> <span id="s291">Well, let’s see.</span> <span id="s292">Of course, those -- the next few weeks are -- just by knowing that we don’t have to worry about being killed and we don’t have to hide out any longer and that we are going home, but we were not sure if our house will still be there, you know, because of all the bombardments and all the destructions and especially if it’s a Jewish home, of course it was destroyed quicker than any -- any -- anybody else’s home.</span> <span id="s293">But the excitement was there, the fact that perhaps my father will be there and perhaps my brother will be there.</span> <span id="s294">So, i-it was a mixture of excitement that we were free and we were going home and the worry of will we see our father again, and will we see our brother again, or you know, my mother’s son.</span> <span id="s295">And -- And then, of course, [indecipherable] my mother always had ways of how to do things and she got that money and we got the tickets and we got on that train and we made it home and it was -- i-it was a long trip.</span> <span id="s296">It was -- oh, God, I know it was long.</span> <span id="s297">It was at least six, seven hours of, you know, of traveling.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: By train?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: By train, right, or maybe even more.</span> <span id="s300">I -- I don’t remember exactly.</span> <span id="s301">Seems to me like it was forever, anyway.</span> <span id="s302">And we made it home and sure enough, there was our house.</span> <span id="s303">It was still there.</span> <span id="s304">Course, inside, everything was empty, you know.</span> <span id="s305">But -- And outside, it was only partially destroyed.</span> <span id="s306">Also, obviously from the shootings and bombardments.</span> <span id="s307">So -- But -- But the fact that the house was there, was a wonderful feeling, and -- and -- and then we began to -- to -- to hope that, you know, the family -- the rest of the family, my brother, my father will come home and -- but no, it didn’t work that way.</span> <span id="s308">My mother was writing letters all over, you know, and the neighbors said that they did see my father with two Gestapos, walking in the street and that was the last time they saw him and nobody knew whatever, what happened to my father.</span> <span id="s309">So we -- After awhile -- After, you know ri -- writing to different places and not getting any response, we knew that we’ll never see him again.</span> <span id="s310">And my brother, well, he was writing to us also.</span> <span id="s311">See, after the war, he also began to write home, and we got his letters.</span> <span id="s312">And so this is how we, you know, started to corresponding and then he came home.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: Now tell me about how long was it and about his -- his coming home.</span> <span id="s314">You must really recall that.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s316">Well, first of all, wh-when we got his letter that he was alive, we were dancing.</span> <span id="s317">I mean, it was just wonderful.</span> <span id="s318">He is -- was the only brother, the oldest brother, the one and only.</span> <span id="s319">And we haven’t seen him in -- in three -- more than three years, I mean, almost four years.</span> <span id="s320">And so the fact that, you know, that he was alive and th -- he would be coming home and so also, you know, my mother, my mother, my aunt, they write papers and you know, there was always a lot of paper -- a lot of paperwork, but it worked and he came.</span> <span id="s321">He was terribly handsome, my brother, so good looking.</span> <span id="s322">Tall, blonde, very good and very intelligent and he was, ah, it was just so wonderful to see him and -- we thought, you know, maybe he was in contact with our father, we just, you know, tried everything.</span> <span id="s323">But no, it just didn’t work out that way.</span> <span id="s324">And then, you know, and my sister, my brother, they went out to work.</span> <span id="s325">My mother went out to work and in between she would fix up the -- the house outside, they made it look real nice.</span> <span id="s326">And we always had an open door for those who needed a place to sleep over.</span> <span id="s327">Even we didn’t have many beds, but there was always the floor, so they could sleep on the floor.</span> <span id="s328">And whoever needed, you know, a meal or something, well our meal consisted of potato soup and that -- potato soup, herring and some black bread and that was very good.</span> <span id="s329">We did very, very well.</span> <span id="s330">Little by little, you know, we had the bed and my mother couldn’t even afford to buy shoes for me, so I would go to the bombed out homes -- houses and look for rope.</span> <span id="s331">And then, separate the rope and my mother bought me a crochet needle and I would crochet slippers.</span> <span id="s332">And I would take a cardboard, cut out the sole, put it inside and that was my shoes.</span> <span id="s333">And then later on, of course, I -- my mother registered me to s -- in school and she had to buy me a pair of shoes.</span> <span id="s334">So, she bought one pair of shoes and I had one uniform and I went to school in the afternoon and in the morning my job was, course, to clean up the house and make the beds, prepare lunch for my family, and they u-used to come home for lunch.</span> <span id="s335">And I washed my own uniform and I did my own pressing and every day you had to go to school with -- with a pressed up blouse, the blouse was always pressed.</span> <span id="s336">And my shoes that my mother bought me and then when I ca -- came home, I would take off the shoes that she bought me and put on my shoes, the ones that I crocheted.</span> <span id="s337">Hand crochet shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: Was this a school of Jewish and Gentile children?</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: This was a public school.</span> <span id="s340">There were hardly any Jews.</span> <span id="s341">We were just about, I think, the only family that survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: Did you feel prejudice there?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: Well, prejudice was always there.</span> <span id="s344">Anti-Semitism always existed.</span> <span id="s345">Persecution always existed, so I guess, from a very young age, I learned that strangers shouldn’t know who you are.</span> <span id="s346">And I did very well in school and myeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: Okay, we -- we cannot change the neighbors activities, so we’re going to move on.</span> <span id="s348">And I wanted to ask Frima, how long were you there, in your home, and what was it that made you move on?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: Okay, we were home for about two years.</span> <span id="s350">But before that -- before the two years of the -- again, I -- I went to school, I did very well, my mother was very proud of me.</span> <span id="s351">My mother received a letter from the government, the city government, that our house is too bi-big just for one family, so they were planning on having two other families moving in, to live with us.</span> <span id="s352">With that, my mother decided that it’s time to go.</span> <span id="s353">And although it was extremely difficult to le-leave the country and the city and the home and -- and whatever she worked for, she felt that this was the time to leave.</span> <span id="s354">And so she again, as smart as my mother was, she again made all kinds of arrangements, got in contact with certain people who helped us get the right papers in order to leave the country.</span> <span id="s355">And that’s what we did and that’s where we started our journey from the Ukraine to Poland, from Poland to Germany, from Germany to France, from France to Cuba, from Cuba to the United States of America and God bless America.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: So, how long did that take?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: To me it took forever.</span> <span id="s358">Is so much the trip.</span> <span id="s359">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: And you were how old when you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: Well, when I arrived in -- in -- [indecipherable] in Cuba, because I lived in Cuba nine years.</span> <span id="s362">So, the age when I arrived in Cuba, I was 13.</span> <span id="s363">In fact, I can show you some -- some leaflets that -- I used to entertain.</span> <span id="s364">I -- I had a very good voice and my aunt was very much involved -- my aunt, who brought us to Cuba, she was very much involved and -- you know, in the Jewish organizations.</span> <span id="s365">And th-that was for her a chance to raise money for her organization, by running a dinner dance, having her niece who just came from the -- from Europe singing all kinds, of course, Holocaust songs.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: Now, I want you to hold this -- this thought, is if we’re trying to see where you were before.</span> <span id="s367">Those places where you were, you mentioned, but I’d like to go into a little more detail --</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: More details?</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: -- about anything you recall, especially in Paris, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: Okay, well, Paris was my last stop, so you want to --</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: So let’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: Let’s start from Poland --</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: -- to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: Your -- Your time in Germany, did you move from place to place?</span> <span id="s378">Did you settle for long?</span> <span id="s379">How did you travel?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: Okay, we are now right, okay.</span> <span id="s381">Okay, our first stop was Poland, where we -- we were there only for about a day, or maybe a day and a half and then by train we went to Germany.</span> <span id="s382">No, excuse me -- yes, but before that, we had to cross borders, okay?</span> <span id="s383">We -- Yes, we did take a train from the Ukraine to Poland, that is correct.</span> <span id="s384">Then in Poland we stayed maybe a day or a day and a half, right.</span> <span id="s385">And then from -- from Poland, we had to cross a border to Germany.</span> <span id="s386">Now, it is illegal, in those days, it was illegal to cross the borders, unless you had, of course, all the right papers, or whatever.</span> <span id="s387">Well -- And, of course, you cannot be Jewish, either.</span> <span id="s388">And that’s already, even after the war.</span> <span id="s389">But, what my mother did is -- there were always people who for money would smuggle you, okay?</span> <span id="s390">And we were not the only ones, there were many Jewish people that wanted to get out of Poland and wanted to, you know, sort of run towards Germany or even Italy, wherever they were able to go and with the hope that from there, they will come to the United States or go to Palestine or go to, you know, different countries.</span> <span id="s391">So, this was -- the arrangement was a --a military truck, who was not -- who was -- did not belong to the military any longer, it belonged to those group of men, two or three of them, who would smuggle people for X amount of money.</span> <span id="s392">And so, you know, you had to pay for each head, whatever it was and I remember so distinctly, this was this -- you know, th-those military trucks that have canvas on top?</span> <span id="s393">You know, those canvas trucks, right?</span> <span id="s394">And we must have been maybe 25 - 30 people, with little children, okay?</span> <span id="s395">Some were sitting on the side, you know, the benches on the side.</span> <span id="s396">Most of us were lying on the floor and -- and -- and people were sitting on top of those who were sitting -- who were lying on the floor.</span> <span id="s397">And when we got to the border, it was -- the guards stopped us and I -- we don’t know what our driver told him, but th-the guards decided to check what -- what they were carrying in that -- in -- in that truck, right?</span> <span id="s398">So, as they started walking to the back, to open up the canvas and see what material they were carrying, our driver took off.</span> <span id="s399">And they started shooting at us.</span> <span id="s400">And he was zigzagging and we were not hit.</span> <span id="s401">Were we lucky?</span> <span id="s402">I’m lucky all the time.</span> <span id="s403">And we made it to Germany, okay?</span> <span id="s404">Now, we arrived in Germany, it was dark.</span> <span id="s405">And there was a -- see, once you’re in Germany, they knew that these Jews were displaced persons.</span> <span id="s406">So they -- no problem, they would just -- you know, ha -- we had to fill out papers, they would register us, who we are, blah, blah, blah and they would -- and -- an-and they was send us to Berlin.</span> <span id="s407">Berlin was like the headquarters for all the Jews that were coming from all over the world and from -- from Berlin, they would send us to different displaced person camps -- DP camps they were called.</span> <span id="s408">So, all over Germany, they had these DP camps, okay?</span> <span id="s409">Our camp was in Bavaria, part of Bavaria.</span> <span id="s410">And -- And the city -- the name of the city was Poking, but our camp was outside of Poking, our DP camp, which wa -- there were like -- there were wooden barracks and I don’t know if these barracks were built after the war or they were there before the war, I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s411">And -- But after the war, I found out that actually these barracks were built on top of a Jewish children cemetery.</span> <span id="s412">Jewish children were buried there.</span> <span id="s413">They were killed during the war, they were buried there and then these barracks were built, you know, before we arrived.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: How did you find that out?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: Well, somebody that -- that was in that area told me, a-a-and I was -- I was shocked, because I -- I didn’t know -- none of us really knew.</span> <span id="s416">So, what happened, so we lived in that area and in that DP camp, I don’t know how many of us were -- but I do know that the museum has a picture of one of the barracks behind me and my sister.</span> <span id="s417">That was my school and that was also our entertainment building.</span> <span id="s418">We used -- I used to entertain, I used to sing.</span> <span id="s419">And there were children who danced and this was our school and this was our social hall.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: To entertain each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: To entertain, yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: And -- And how did you start your interest in singing, was it here at the DP --</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: At -- Wh -- Yeah, yeah, at the DP camp, right</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: Did you by any chance sing when you were young, by yourself, because you spent so much time alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: Well no, I -- those were not the times for me to sing, when I knew that I’m all alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: And when did you start singing?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: After the war, when I came home.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: So, part of your liberation is, in a way was --</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: Yeah, probably you are right, yes, probably that was the reason.</span> <span id="s430">Yeah, come to think about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: Not to mention your talent</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: Well, I had -- No, I had a good reason to sing then, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: And your sleeping arrangement in the barracks, were you separated the women and the men, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: Oh, no, no, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s435">We had one room and we as a family, a whole family, you know the four of us, yeah, all four of us, yeah, my -- well, m-my father wasn’t with us any longer.</span> <span id="s436">That’s my brother, my sister, myself and my mother, right.</span> <span id="s437">We had one room and you know, every family had a room.</span> <span id="s438">It was very -- That was very good.</span> <span id="s439">This is where the HIAS and Joint came in and they helped us.</span> <span id="s440">HIAS?</span> <span id="s441">It’s the Hebrew -- Hebrew, God, the HIAS, how they -- they spell it?</span> <span id="s442">Well they, it’s H-I-A-S.</span> <span id="s443">That’s an organization that provides people who are need of food and clothing, they provide them.</span> <span id="s444">And also the Joint.</span> <span id="s445">That’s J-o-i-n-t, Joint.</span> <span id="s446">They also an -- are an organization that provide, you know, the refugees and the Displaced Person with food and clothing, cause none of us had jobs and we had to eat.</span> <span id="s447">And so, whatever we got, it was no big deal, but it still was food, and -- and clothing.</span> <span id="s448">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: Your family worked on --</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: There was nothing to work, there are no jobs for us.</span> <span id="s451">We had no jobs.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: No jobs for money, but I mean, what did you do during the day?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: Oh, oh well, you know, my mother would help out the sick people, somebody was sick.</span> <span id="s454">I went to school.</span> <span id="s455">Right away a school was set up.</span> <span id="s456">In every DP camp there was a school and we went to school.</span> <span id="s457">We would -- We were taught Jewish, Hebrew and the language of the country, yeah.</span> <span id="s458">And la -- as I said, and -- and the schoolchildren we used to entertain, like once a week, we would have -- you know, for the parents and the whole DP camp would come and we would entertain, singing and dancing and you name it and we did all these things.</span> <span id="s459">We also, you know, we had all kinds of competitions, bicycle riding and running and jumping and you name it, I mean we -- they kept us really busy.</span> <span id="s460">Yeah, it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: Do you have pleasant memories of that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: They were pleasant because I didn’t have to worry about pogroms and I was not surrounded by barbed wires and I -- and I didn’t have -- I didn’t hear the German Shepherds bark.</span> <span id="s463">So, that was like feeling I’m safe.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: Who were the leaders?</span> <span id="s465">Do you remember the leaders of the DP camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: So, is there any other thought or experience you had there, before -- in Bavaria, before we move on to the next place?</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: Yeah, well, a-a-after this -- a-after Shlupfing and that’s the DP, my first DP camp where we stayed, they suddenly decided to close this DP camp and they moved us to another DP camp, not too far, you know, a few kilometers from this one, which was a much larger one and the name of that camp was Volshtadt.</span> <span id="s469">It was also in Bavaria.</span> <span id="s470">So, we stayed in the first camp like, I think, a year or so and -- and the same amount of time in the other camp, until -- well, time came when they said, ofka -- of course, you have to move on.</span> <span id="s471">Okay, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: How did they decide that?</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: Well, usually what everyone tried to do is get in touch with their f-families or relatives in whichever country they had relatives and the relatives would have the papers ready for them.</span> <span id="s474">Like, we had papers to come into the United States, except, when we got from Germany to France, from where we were supposed to come to the United States, we were supposed to wait longer on that quota th-th-the am -- the American quota was very slow.</span> <span id="s475">I imagine they had maybe a lot of people.</span> <span id="s476">So we had to wait.</span> <span id="s477">And my mother --</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: Now how did -- You -- You’ve gotten to the second DP camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: Right.</span> <span id="s480">And we lived there for about a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: One year.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s483">Continued going to school.</span> <span id="s484">I also, in between, would help out mothers with little children like I was a babysitter.</span> <span id="s485">I mean, free of charge, you know.</span> <span id="s486">And we had synagogue who caught fire and you know, because these were old barracks, they were dried pieces of wood put together, huts really.</span> <span id="s487">I mean that’s -- that’s what it was.</span> <span id="s488">But we knew it was temporary and everything, you know, compared to what we had to go through during, you know, during the pogroms, this was fine.</span> <span id="s489">And so we were looking forward that, you know, tomorrow will be a better tomorrow.</span> <span id="s490">And sure enough, the tomorrow came where we had to take the train from Munich to Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: Now did you stay in Munich at all, or just passing through?</span></p> <p><span id="s492">A: No, we -- we just went to Munich to take the train to Paris and we did and we lived in a rooming house.</span> <span id="s493">I don’t think it was a hotel, I think it was a rooming house.</span> <span id="s494">We had one room.</span> <span id="s495">We lived there for five months.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: Did an organization pay for your --</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: You see, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s498">I think it was a combination between the organization and my family in the United States who send us, you know, send money and packages at that time, you understand?</span> <span id="s499">They were also helping us out.</span> <span id="s500">So, I don’t -- You know, I -- I -- I can’t say if they were going to say if the organization paid for our stay completely or it was half and half.</span> <span id="s501">But, whichever way it was, they were always there if we needed help.</span> <span id="s502">This -- This I do remember.</span> <span id="s503">Everyone said, you know, if we need -- you need help, you go to the HIAS or you go to the Joint and they will help you, and -- and I imagine they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: What language were you speaking then?</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: Well, when I wasn’t in -- in Germany, of course I -- I spoke Russian and I spoke Yiddish and I spoke Hebrew and I spoke a little German and I hated the language.</span> <span id="s506">Course a lot of things also happened in Germany.</span> <span id="s507">I -- I -- I -- I don’t know how I got it, but one evening, the night of Yom Kippur, I was sitting outside the synagogue and I suddenly got this terrible headache.</span> <span id="s508">I came home and I was running an -- a very, very high temperature.</span> <span id="s509">And my mother called a doctor and he came and he examined me and he said that immediately they have to take me in by ambulance to outskirts of -- of Berlin, because I am very sick and I might have diphtheria and that’s a contagious disease.</span> <span id="s510">So, can you imagine?</span> <span id="s511">Here I am, I thought I was finished with Germany, but here I am sick and they taking me with a German ambulance to a hospital on the outskirts --</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: From?</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: Berlin.</span> <span id="s514">Outskirts of Berlin --</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: Wh --</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: From Berlin -- From the DP camp in Berlin.</span> <span id="s517">I mean, yes, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: Let’s go to the next tape.</span> <span id="s519">We’re going to finish the story, but I need to change tapes.</span> <span id="s520">We’re going to Frima Laub, tape two, side A.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Frima Laub, conducted by Ginger Miles, on November 23rd, 1998.</span> <span id="s523">This is tape number two, side A. Tell us where we are, because we started with this story --</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: Right now, we are ou -- we are back in Berlin, in the DP camp.</span> <span id="s525">This is --</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: The third DP camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: No, the first DP camp.</span> <span id="s528">I’m -- The reason I’m going back is because I want to tell you that I got sick, okay?</span> <span id="s529">Yeah, okay?</span> <span id="s530">How’d it ever go back to us -- but anyway, this is just a reminder as to what happened to me, while we were in -- in -- in Berlin -- in the Displaced Person camp in Berlin, after we arrived from Poland, and after we cross the border to Germany.</span> <span id="s531">We were there for a short while, but during that time, the night before Yom Kippur, I suddenly was -- was hit with a terrible headache, while sitting outside the synagogue and listening to the prayers.</span> <span id="s532">And my mother called the doctor and he immediately ordered a -- an ambulance to take me to a German hospital outside of Berlin, because I was very sick, and what I had was diphtheria, which is a contagious disease.</span> <span id="s533">And so, three weeks I was in that hospital, in isolation and I did not sleep and I did not eat, because I was afraid they’ll kill me again.</span> <span id="s534">And I -- I was not allowed to have visitors, so my mother would come and stand by the window and just wave to me.</span> <span id="s535">And every time they gave me an injection, I would say, “This is it.</span> <span id="s536">They killed me.”</span> <span id="s537">And I was afraid to eat, because in case there’s poison in it.</span> <span id="s538">All because I knew I’m a Jew.</span> <span id="s539">I don’t know if they knew I was Jewish, but obviously they did know that I’m Jewish because they took me by ambulance from the DP camp.</span> <span id="s540">And the only people that went to the DP camps, were the Jews.</span> <span id="s541">So, after that, we went to the next DP camp and then to the next one, the third one, which was Volshtadt, and then from Volshtadt, we went to -- to Munich, to catch the train to Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: Okay, now before we --</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: And here, we’re on our way to Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: Before we get on our way to Paris, just because this is so fresh in your mind, has your fear of Germans or the German language carried on through to your life to this day?</span> <span id="s545">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s546">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: Could you talk a little bit about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s549">Well, the language brings memories and many times I just -- I-I-I’ll just -- I’ll sort of cover my ears, not to hear the language, because it -- it brings memories in the -- and I really get very upset.</span> <span id="s550">I -- I -- I -- I -- I never felt really, completely free, you know, a-away.</span> <span id="s551">So, when I lived in Germany, there was still fear inside of me that, if they know that I am a Jew, something might happen to me, or they’ll do something to me.</span> <span id="s552">And to this day, it didn’t change.</span> <span id="s553">And the German Shepherd, that dog, when I hear him bark, I don’t even have to see him.</span> <span id="s554">Terrible feeling.</span> <span id="s555">I -- I-I-It’s very hard to end -- to -- to even explain.</span> <span id="s556">It’s like my -- my stomach jumps.</span> <span id="s557">My heart starts racing.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: I never heard anyone speak about German Shepherds.</span> <span id="s559">How were they involved in your history?</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: In my life?</span> <span id="s561">Well, during the first pogrom, when we were rounded up, they came to the ghetto, where th -- th -- the SS came with the German Shepherds and so, that is to make sure that we don’t run or we don’t do anything, right?</span> <span id="s562">I mean, we were helpless anyway, because it was very early in the morning.</span> <span id="s563">It was just beginning to light -- to get light and we were sleeping and they started knocking on -- on the windows and on the doors.</span> <span id="s564">And of course, with that, as they were knocking, the German Shepherds were barking.</span> <span id="s565">And then ho -- all -- a-after we were lined up to go, you know, to the slaughterhouse I call it, you know, where they did the killings, on both sides of the roads, on the road that we walked towards the slaughterhouse, they had the SS, with the German Shepherds, standing there.</span> <span id="s566">And so, to me, as I was looking at them, was frightening.</span> <span id="s567">And during the time that I was alone, and I was walking the streets, I used to hide between the trees at night, when I would go back to the ladies house, to sleep under -- under her house, I would go between the shadows of the trees, I should not be noticed by the German Shepherd.</span> <span id="s568">Because, you know, they -- they -- if they see a shadow, they’ll -- they’ll run after a shadow.</span> <span id="s569">I was ou -- I tried to be so careful.</span> <span id="s570">I-It was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s571">And their barking just never left me.</span> <span id="s572">And the fear of what they can do to you, with their masters, I mean, i-is something that did not change my feelings and th-this is unfortunate that -- the language -- a-and I would just never go back.</span> <span id="s573">I keep saying, I would never go back to Germany, although sometimes I say I want to go back and see the place where I lived, the DP camps, but I’m not sure if -- if it’s -- you know, what’s there.</span> <span id="s574">It’s probably nothing, it’s a cemetery now.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: So you’ve never gone back at all to your --</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: No, I just --</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: And what about Paris, since we were about to arrive --</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: Well, Paris, I would love to go back, I -- I told my husband I would like to show him -- I hope that that rooming house is still there, where we lived and I would like to show it to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: And so, in Paris, you didn’t need to know French?</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: Oh yes, I learn quickly, a little bit of French.</span> <span id="s581">I -- Of course, I did not go to school, because this was in the middle of the semester, so nobody would take me, but I kept very busy.</span> <span id="s582">I did learn, you know, I had to go shopping for my mother, I did learn important things.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: And the money, I --</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: And how to travel.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: And your money came from?</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: My aunts.</span> <span id="s587">Remember I told you my aunts and then, you know, my mother, every so often, would sell something else that we had, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: Your aunts in Cuba?</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: I had an aunt in Cuba and twins in the United States, yeah, so they -- they really, all of them helped us and th-that was very important, because none of us were able to work for five months in -- in, you know, in Paris.</span> <span id="s590">But, we did do a lot of volunteer work.</span> <span id="s591">I, for example, would babysit for -- for the young couples with children, all sort -- you know, immigrants.</span> <span id="s592">They were in transit from Paris to somewheres, okay?</span> <span id="s593">And -- And if the mother wasn’t feeling well, I would take care on the baby.</span> <span id="s594">You know, I was like a babysitter or a mother’s helper.</span> <span id="s595">Then, once a week, there was a -- a -- a group of Moroccan Jews that lived on a hill and I don’t remember the name of the hill, also, outskirts of Paris.</span> <span id="s596">And I learned quickly, how to travel by Metro and I would go all over Paris.</span> <span id="s597">I knew exactly where I had to go.</span> <span id="s598">And of course, as I said, I learned the necessary vocabulary that I needed --</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: By now you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: -- to -- to get around.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: -- you were a big girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: Yeah, I was 12 years old, that’s correct.</span> <span id="s603">Almost ready to get married.</span> <span id="s604">And I would -- I would collect clothing from different people and I would go to the bakeries and collect breads and cakes and pick up two valises and go to these Moroccan people and bring them food and clothing.</span> <span id="s605">And was bit heavy because there were maybe -- maybe, oh, I don’t know, maybe 50, maybe 60 people, I don’t know how many, i-it -- and they lived like in a cave.</span> <span id="s606">It wasn’t even a house.</span> <span id="s607">It looked like a cave.</span> <span id="s608">And, of course, you must understand, not everyone was lucky to have a bed or a shower.</span> <span id="s609">So, I don’t know how long these people were living there, but they developed an odor that when I used to come to the hill, before I even walked up, I -- I -- I held my breath.</span> <span id="s610">And then I would walk up and leave the two valises in front of the entrance and run away.</span> <span id="s611">That -- That’s what I did, for five months.</span> <span id="s612">So -- And my mother did other volunteer work and my sister did volunteer work and my brother did volunteer work, you know, whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: What encouraged you to do volunteer work, your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: Yeah, my mother always did things.</span> <span id="s615">Our home was always open, we always had people coming, going.</span> <span id="s616">We had a large table and the middle of the table, there was that summervar -- the summervar.</span> <span id="s617">You know what a summervar is?</span> <span id="s618">It’s that Russian, big coffee pot or teapot.</span> <span id="s619">That’s summervar, and with glasses and -- and we always had people coming and my mother always baked a cookie, a -- you know, and fruits and people would have a -- a glass of tea, not a cup of tea.</span> <span id="s620">So -- And -- And this thing was, you know, with coal -- coal inside and that what made the water hot, and -- so it -- i-it was an open house and -- and after the war, it was also an open house.</span> <span id="s621">Remember I told you, whoever needed some potato soup, well, had a meal in my house and -- and if they needed a place to sleep, well, there weren’t enou -- there weren’t enough beds, but we had a floor, so no problem.</span> <span id="s622">M --</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: I’m going to ask you something about your comment.</span> <span id="s624">I know you were just making it lightly, but when you said you were 12 and you were almost ready to get married, does that mean you were starting to get interested in boys here?</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: No, I’m just kidding you.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: Oh, okay.</span> <span id="s627">So did you have any social life?</span> <span id="s628">Who did you [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: No.</span> <span id="s630">In Paris?</span> <span id="s631">None whatsoever, nothing.</span> <span id="s632">What we did in Paris is, you know, I would take my mother to the Eif-Eiffel Tower, and we’ll go to Pigall, to the street of Pigall, there was a lot of entertainment there.</span> <span id="s633">I would walk -- of course I couldn’t afford to go into the opera, but I would walk from where I lived, just to stand there and look at this magnificent building, the opera.</span> <span id="s634">So, no, we -- you know, like every day, I would take my mother someplace else and we would just go and look, you know, and I remember the whole family one day, we went to Marseilles.</span> <span id="s635">That was very nice.</span> <span id="s636">You know, we kept busy.</span> <span id="s637">You know, I was never bored, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: But basically, you were there, sort of waiting to move?</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: Yeah, exactly.</span> <span id="s640">We knew it was -- We were -- It was just sort of a hop over place, you know?</span> <span id="s641">And after the five months that we were in France, we -- we went to Cannes -- oh, well, as I said, I’m jumping.</span> <span id="s642">We were supposed to go to the United States from Paris, except that the quota was delayed and --</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: Quota?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: Yeah, quota.</span> <span id="s645">There was always a quota.</span> <span id="s646">And my mother heard that there is going to be a World War Three, and so she became panicky and she said, “We must leave Europe immediately.”</span> <span id="s647">So, she had a sister in Cuba.</span> <span id="s648">She call -- you know, she wrote to her a letter, and my aunt, you know, did whatever she was able to do, which wa -- it wasn’t easy to come to Cuba, but my aunt again, you know, paid whatever had to be paid and made the right papers and we went from Paris to Cannes and we took a boat, a commercial boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: In France?</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: That -- In France, yeah that -- that’s the Riviera, okay, the area of Riviera, which I don’t know them, because again, we went there at night.</span> <span id="s651">But this is from where the commercial -- a Polish commercial ship was leaving and we were the passengers on that ship.</span> <span id="s652">And for three weeks we were on that ship, going to Cuba.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: Do you remember it -- the other people you shared it with, or you -- it doesn’t look like it was a pleasant experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: No, because it was a commercial ship, I think we were the only family, maybe there were a few other single people.</span> <span id="s655">Not going to Cuba, they were just working on -- on that ship.</span> <span id="s656">We were the only ones who went to Cuba.</span> <span id="s657">But that ship made a stopover in Cuba, either picking up cargo or -- or delivering something.</span> <span id="s658">And this is how we wind up going with this commercial ship.</span> <span id="s659">A, because I don’t know i-i-if there were any luxury ships going from France to Cuba and B, if there were, we probably couldn’t afford them.</span> <span id="s660">So, this was the next best thing.</span> <span id="s661">Course, it was -- it was a very hard trip.</span> <span id="s662">I mean, i-i-it’s not a luxury ship and we were all the way on the bottom there, in the cabins.</span> <span id="s663">And -- A-Although I wasn’t sick, my sister was sick all the time, my mother was pretty good, my brother was pretty good.</span> <span id="s664">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: How did you eat?</span> <span id="s666">A: -- it seemed like forever.</span> <span id="s667">Well, we didn’t eat much, there wasn’t much to eat, but there was bread and there was butter and there was milk and there was fish, I think, yeah fish.</span> <span id="s668">And that was fine.</span> <span id="s669">I mean, yes -- couldn’t really starve, a hard boiled eggs, I mean, you know, you -- a fruits, looks -- they didn’t feed like it’s a luxury boat.</span> <span id="s670">You have to understand, to me this was already luxury compared to my life before.</span> <span id="s671">This was wonderful.</span> <span id="s672">But, the sea was rough and -- a-and three weeks is a long time when it’s not really the right type of a boat, you know, to travel such a long time.</span> <span id="s673">But, we made it and it was a beautiful day when we arrived in Havana.</span> <span id="s674">It was beautiful.</span> <span id="s675">It was sunny like this and then when we came out on the deck and we looked down in that little launcher, which is a little boat, there were my aunts, waving to us, oh.</span> <span id="s676">That was such an exciting moment in our lives, my God.</span> <span id="s677">These were aunts I didn’t know, cause when they left, I -- I was very little and my -- my -- my grandmother, who was their mother, she left, I was six months old, so I -- I -- and of course, she died here, before I came.</span> <span id="s678">My -- My dis -- M-My maternal grandmother died the day after we were liberated and she did not know that her oldest daughter was alive.</span> <span id="s679">Isn’t that sad?</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Q: Your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: Yeah, my mother was the oldest daughter out of four daughters and -- and one son.</span> <span id="s682">She didn’t know.</span> <span id="s683">And my aunts told me that she used to pray every day and say, “Oh, I wonder where my daughter Eta is with her ch -- family.</span> <span id="s684">Where is she?</span> <span id="s685">Is she al -- Is she alive, Is she alive?”</span> <span id="s686">And she died the day before.</span> <span id="s687">It was so sad.</span> <span id="s688">Okay, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: So these aunts were your mother’s sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s691">From my father’s side, everybody was killed.</span> <span id="s692">In fact, on Yom Kippur of 1942, right?</span> <span id="s693">‘42?</span> <span id="s694">‘41?</span> <span id="s695">Get me, I think it’s ‘42 - 1942.</span> <span id="s696">The whole town was wiped out.</span> <span id="s697">The whole town of Volachisk was wiped out.</span> <span id="s698">That included my grandmother, her sons, her only daughter, her grandchildren, you know, aunts, uncles, you name it.</span> <span id="s699">The whole town was wiped out.</span> <span id="s700">So, from my father’s side, nobody.</span> <span id="s701">We had here a few cousins, my father’s few cousins.</span> <span id="s702">One is in Israel, one was here, she already passed away a long time ago.</span> <span id="s703">So, all we really had are my mother’s sisters and my mother’s brother.</span> <span id="s704">And so my -- th-th-the three sisters were in that boat, you know, on that little boat, launcher, you know, looking up to us while we were on the deck waiting, you know, to disembark.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: What are their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A: Oh my, well the oldest one next to my mother is Clara, and she passed away a long time ago.</span> <span id="s707">A lovely lady.</span> <span id="s708">We -- We lived with her for awhile until we were able -- she was the one who lived in Cuba and she was the one who made us the papers and we lived with her until we were able to afford an apartment.</span> <span id="s709">You know, until my mother went out to -- my mother never went out to work, I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s710">My brother went out to work, my sister went out to work and I went out to work.</span> <span id="s711">Mother’s wouldn’t -- did not work in those days, at least not by us.</span> <span id="s712">To us, she was a mother, and she was a widow and she’s not to work.</span> <span id="s713">So my mother was a housewife and we worked.</span> <span id="s714">And then my other two aunts, the -- the other one who is next -- well, my uncle wasn’t there, he was in Florida and his name is Abraham and he is not here any longer, may he rest in peace.</span> <span id="s715">And then the next sister is Margaret and she passed away two years ago and I have just one and only little aunt, my mother’s youngest sister Elizabeth and she lives in Florida.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: Your mother’s maiden name is?</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: Is Glaser.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Q: Glaser.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A: Yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: And that is the story --</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: Of Cuba?</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: No, that’s only the beginning, when we arrived.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: Do you want to take a break?</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: If you don’t mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s728">And I’m going to have a cup of coffee.</span> <span id="s729">How’s that, okay?</span> <span id="s730">Is it okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: Yeah, I need something for my throat.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: So we are in Cuba and you were telling me when we took a break what -- what you did when you were there.</span> <span id="s734">When you first there and how you learned the language, how you worked with a sick aunt and --</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s736">Okay, well, when we arrived in Cuba, in Havana, it was during middle of semester.</span> <span id="s737">So, no school would accept me in the middle of semester.</span> <span id="s738">So, in the meantime, I learned the language on my own, and in three months I spoke Spanish fluently.</span> <span id="s739">It truly is a lovely, lovely language and lovely, lovely people.</span> <span id="s740">And we lived with my Aunt Clara, who brought us to Cuba, for about five weeks and then my brother, my sister, they got jobs and we were able to rent an apartment a block away from my aunt and we moved into our own apartment, a one bedroom.</span> <span id="s741">And well, after I spoke Spanish, my cousin who is Clara’s daughter, and she’s not with us any longer, Dorothy, she went with me to a private school and asked them if they would accept me, since I came from Europe and I had f-finished six grades in -- no, not six grades, I finished about five grades in -- in Germany and they were -- after examining me, they were willing to accept me.</span> <span id="s742">Now, this was a private school of about 45 kids and I was the only Jewish person.</span> <span id="s743">And they were so enthused with me.</span> <span id="s744">And they liked me so much, of course -- oh, before they took me, though, I had to go through exams from first grade, all the way to sixth grade.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: In Spanish?</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: That, absolutely.</span> <span id="s747">Okay?</span> <span id="s748">And that’s when I was accepted to the sixth grade, because I was up to par with them.</span> <span id="s749">And I was even better in math.</span> <span id="s750">I was very, very good in math.</span> <span id="s751">So -- And, plus the fact that, I-I-I’m a very well-behaved girl and I had the honor, and -- and I know that a lot of the kids were very jealous and they really resented the fact that I, as a Jewish girl, an immigrant coming from Europe, I had the honor of holding the Cuban flag every morning when we sang the Cuban anthem.</span> <span id="s752">And after the year -- you know, after graduating sixth grade, I graduated with a gold medal.</span> <span id="s753">And that was [indecipherable] school.</span> <span id="s754">Then, I did mention to you that my aunt [indecipherable] opportunity of raising money for her organization by running a dinner dance, and so I sang, you know, songs from the concentration camps and songs from the ghettos.</span> <span id="s755">And my a -- my -- my -- my cousin Dorothy, her daughter, she would play the piano.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: You sang in Spanish?</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: I sang in Jewish.</span> <span id="s758">There were Jewish songs and Hebrew songs.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">Q: Do you remember what -- any one now?</span></p> <p><span id="s760">A: Yeah, well, except I don’t have the voice and if I start singing, I will start crying.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Q: Well, I don’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s762">A: They’re very sad songs, they really are.</span> <span id="s763">They’re sad.</span> <span id="s764">And wa -- I will just give you the title of one of the songs and that’s “Puppyrosen.”</span> <span id="s765">Puppyrosen in Russian means cigarettes.</span> <span id="s766">And the song is about a little boy who was left a orphan and -- and -- and he’s standing at the corner of a street, trying to make some money and it’s windy and it’s cold and it’s raining.</span> <span id="s767">And he’s asking, “Please, buy this cigarettes, so you can save my life.”</span> <span id="s768">Was a really very sad.</span> <span id="s769">So I can’t sing it for you.</span> <span id="s770">And there were other, you know, very sad songs about Jewish survival and atrocities and horrors that -- you know, that we went through.</span> <span id="s771">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s772">Q: What are any more of the songs?</span></p> <p><span id="s773">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q: What other songs?</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A: Oh, let’s see which other so -- oh, there wa -- there was one happy song.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: The happy song was, after all these sad songs, it was, “I’m -- I’m going to Israel, and I’m saying goodbye to all of you and I’m so happy that we are finally free and we going to the land -- to our Promised Land, and -- and -- oh, and this land is -- is a blessing for the Jews and it was promised,” you know, “by God and -- a-a-a-and this -- this land is so important to -- a-a-a -- the -- to the Jewish nation.</span> <span id="s778">It’s like -- a-an -- i-it -- it’s so important to -- to -- to the Jewish nations, like the right hand is to your body.”</span> <span id="s779">I mean, a-and there’s other which I -- offhand, I just -- I can’t think.</span> <span id="s780">Well, anyway, she raised a lot of money, because so many people came an-and later on I’ll show you, I have one of those flyers that she made out, with my picture on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: She was raising money for Jewish organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s783">You know, for Jewish organizations and the organizations in Cuba which dealt with, you know, children and poor people, or whatever.</span> <span id="s784">No, I need my thi -- I got it, I got it, it’s okay, it’s okay.</span> <span id="s785">You know, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: You can stop whenever you want --</span></p> <p><span id="s787">A: No -- no --</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Q: -- and have -- have some coffee.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">A: -- that’s okay, that’s fine, no.</span> <span id="s790">So that was that and course, after I graduated my Spanish school, I -- I -- I -- I took a job in a factory -- my cousin in a fac --</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q: You graduated from school at what age?</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: At --</span></p> <p><span id="s794">A: At 13 - 13.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: You graduated at 13?</span></p> <p><span id="s796">A: Yeah, 13 I graduated sixth grade.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: Sixth grade.</span> <span id="s798">Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: That’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: And that’s as far as you went in Cuba?</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s802">At that time.</span> <span id="s803">Then, I -- I -- I had -- Took my -- I had a job and I worked in a factory and I was -- I used to pack merchandise and I -- I -- in the shipping department, okay?</span> <span id="s804">And I would go to school at night.</span> <span id="s805">And that’s how I continued my education, by going to school at night.</span> <span id="s806">And in turn, my -- my -- my aunt got very sick, the one who brought us to Cuba, Clara.</span> <span id="s807">And she -- she had her kidney removed and -- a-and I felt so obligated, you know, to -- to her, for being so good to us and bringing us to Cuba and setting us up and helping us and -- and buying me things, clothing and all the things that I -- I -- I wanted to be her nurse, yeah, so I can stay with her until she gets better.</span> <span id="s808">And luckily, because I stayed with her, I discovered that she had diabetes.</span> <span id="s809">After surgery, she developed diabetes.</span> <span id="s810">And how did I detected diabetes?</span> <span id="s811">Because I would change her wound every morning.</span> <span id="s812">And one morning I took that sheet and I hung it outside, she had a balcony by her window.</span> <span id="s813">You know, by her room and later on when I went to take it in, I saw ants crawling on that area and I knew it had to be sugar, glucose.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q: All right, now we’re moving over to the other side of tape two.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: All right, this is tape two, side B, of an interview with Frima Laub.</span> <span id="s817">We are in Cuba and in the hospital with your aunt.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A: Yeah, and so when the doctor came, I told him, I says, “You know, doctor, this and this is what happened.</span> <span id="s819">And sure enough, when they -- after they tested her, they found out that she had -- she developed diabetes during surgery.</span> <span id="s820">Isn’t that something?</span> <span id="s821">You know, from the shock, many times people develop diabetes.</span> <span id="s822">Well, I remained with her at the hospital 24 hours a day for five weeks, until she got better and then she went home.</span> <span id="s823">I went home and I continued working and actually, I was able to take off from work because I worked for her son, her son had the factory, so it was no problem.</span> <span id="s824">My siblings worked.</span> <span id="s825">My mother did not work, because in those years, and according to our -- our way of life, a mother should not be working.</span> <span id="s826">Her place is at home, and that’s what we did.</span> <span id="s827">My mother stayed home, she was a housewife and all of us worked and we all, you know, chipped in and paid for the rent and we had a one bedroom apartment, my mother and I, cause at that time already, my sister got married and she lived in a different city.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: To a Cuban man?</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: Yeah, yeah, someone --</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q: Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: -- ah, Jewish, yeah.</span> <span id="s832">A Jewi -- Cuban Jewi -- a Cuban Jew.</span> <span id="s833">And -- And my brother had his own place in Havana and my mother and I, we lived on the outskirts of Havana, we had the one bedroom apartment.</span> <span id="s834">And not too far from my aunt, of course, you know.</span> <span id="s835">And I -- I had -- I had a lot of friends and I loved the Cuban people.</span> <span id="s836">And w-we were never afraid we would, you know, go out at night and walk, one, two o’clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s837">Nobody ever was afraid of anybody, everything was very peaceful.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: Who was the leader of Cuba at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s839">A: At that time, was Batista.</span> <span id="s840">Fulgencio Batista.</span> <span id="s841">And -- In fact, while talking about Fulgencio Batista, a group of us, we were -- we had some friends who worked in Batista’s summer home, Valadero Beach, and we were -- you know, we went to Valadero, which is very beautiful town near the most beautiful beach in the world.</span> <span id="s842">We went to spend some time by the beach and our friends who worked for Batista asked us if we wanted to sleep over in Batista’s summer home, since the family was away.</span> <span id="s843">So we did.</span> <span id="s844">How about that?</span> <span id="s845">Boy, boyo.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">Q: How old were you then?</span> <span id="s847">Teenager, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s848">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">A: At that time I was already a teenager, but to me it was something very exciting, to sleep in a president’s house.</span> <span id="s851">Hey, that was quite an honor.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Q: Were most of your friends and associates Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s853">A: Well, where I worked -- you know, later on, of course, I changed jobs.</span> <span id="s854">15, I already worked -- was it 15 or 16?</span> <span id="s855">Probably 16, excuse me, at the age of 16, that means three years I worked in the factory.</span> <span id="s856">Then, I -- I -- I worked in a department store as a buyer.</span> <span id="s857">I -- I had all kinds of friends.</span> <span id="s858">I had a Italian friend who had a beautiful voice and he sang like Mario Lanza.</span> <span id="s859">Oh, he had such a beautiful voice.</span> <span id="s860">And, of course, we used to sing at all our friends weddings.</span> <span id="s861">That means we worked -- we all worked the same place.</span> <span id="s862">So there were a few who were getting married.</span> <span id="s863">So, when we used to go to their weddings, he -- oh, what was his name?</span> <span id="s864">Ooh.</span> <span id="s865">Gino, I think.</span> <span id="s866">Gino, Gino.</span> <span id="s867">We would sing together.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: In Spanish?</span></p> <p><span id="s869">A: Of course, yeah, that was in Spanish.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">A: Well, we had s -- had Syrian friends.</span> <span id="s872">I had Italian friends, I had Cuban friends, I had Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s873">I also had a -- an Oriental friend.</span> <span id="s874">Yeah, I -- I -- I was beautiful.</span> <span id="s875">Only, we were just --</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: There -- There was a large population of Chinese immigrants into Cuba also, wasn’t there?</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: Yes, I would say yes and I’m thinking that it was not as large as -- the -- it wasn’t very large, because you see, i-it’s a very small country, a -- really very small, so mostly, everyone settle in Havana, so there was, you know, X amount, a small population of Jewish people, Chinese people, whatyouma -- Syrian people, you know?</span> <span id="s878">But e -- you can call it, I think, you know, if you say for -- for a little country like that, maybe it was, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Q: I get the feeling that in Cuba, you did not feel so much prejudice, is that true?</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A: That is very true.</span> <span id="s881">That is very, very true.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">Q: Even though they are just -- for the most part, traditionally Catholic?</span></p> <p><span id="s883">A: They were just wonderful.</span> <span id="s884">There were truly -- They’re -- They’re not hostile -- They were not hostile people.</span> <span id="s885">They were very compassionate people.</span> <span id="s886">A-And --And if they heard, oh you came from -- from Europe, oh then, you know, they have to extra care -- extra good care of you, you know?</span> <span id="s887">This is the type of people they were.</span> <span id="s888">They were also people like -- if they would have a piece of bread and you tell them you’re hungry, they’ll give you half of their bread.</span> <span id="s889">Without asking any questions, it doesn’t matter who you are.</span> <span id="s890">So, this is the type of people that they were.</span> <span id="s891">Of course, I don’t know what kind of people they are today.</span> <span id="s892">Must understand, it’s been over 40 years.</span> <span id="s893">Now, leadership had changed, and people changed --</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Q: Oh, but yi -- that’s not why you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s895">A: Oh, no, no, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s896">Not at all.</span> <span id="s897">The reason why -- I left before Castro came into power and that was simply because I felt that there wasn’t for me, enough, in Cuba, as far as a social life, as far as marriage.</span> <span id="s898">You know, like -- are -- and I felt that -- and my aunts really wanted me to come here.</span> <span id="s899">That was a good reason.</span> <span id="s900">So they quickly made up papers for me and I came to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">Q: Your mother stayed in Cuba?</span> <span id="s902">A: Yeah, my mother stayed in Cuba.</span> <span id="s903">My sister was married and she stayed in Cuba.</span> <span id="s904">My brother came to the United States before I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q: Oh, so he was already here?</span></p> <p><span id="s906">A: Yeah, he was already here.</span> <span id="s907">And then I came, you know, for -- on a temporary we -- visa, to see, you know, do I like it, don’t I like it?</span> <span id="s908">You know, what’s doing.</span> <span id="s909">And while I was here, Castro came into power, because I came here in 1957, okay?</span> <span id="s910">And Castro came into power 1959 or ‘60, something like that.</span> <span id="s911">19 six -- maybe ‘59.</span> <span id="s912">Oh well, something like.</span> <span id="s913">So, I -- I came here and I lived with my aunts.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">Q: So you never went back?</span></p> <p><span id="s915">A: Oh, yes I did.</span> <span id="s916">I went back to visit my mother, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s918">Many times?</span></p> <p><span id="s919">A: N-Not many times, because then my mother decided to come here, too, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s920">Q: Because of the political scene?</span></p> <p><span id="s921">A: Because she felt my brother’s here and I’m here, then -- and her sisters are here, so what is she going to do there, you know?</span> <span id="s922">And the other sister were here already, too.</span> <span id="s923">You see, like, my aunt also moved here.</span> <span id="s924">So my aunt and -- my mother decided she may as well stay -- come to the United States.</span> <span id="s925">Why stay in Cuba?</span></p> <p><span id="s926">Q: Do you remember any particular feelings of sadness about leaving from one place to another, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A: I -- I -- You know, I -- I really didn’t feel sad, because I knew Cuba’s only 45 minutes from -- from Miami, so it’s not like you going away -- far, far away.</span> <span id="s928">And then, the fact that I’m -- I’m having family here and my brother’s here an-and my mother was willing to come, so I didn’t feel that I was lonely, you know, that I’ll be alone in the world, so no, I -- I always felt I can go back to Cuba.</span> <span id="s929">Uh-huh, you have a ha -- an hour.</span> <span id="s930">Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: All right, so, in your arrival to America, where did your family live and where did you first settle?</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A: Okay, the first stop was east New York.</span> <span id="s933">My aunt lived on Miller Avenue.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Q: On what?</span></p> <p><span id="s935">A: Miller Avenue, in east New York.</span> <span id="s936">And, very lovely area and this is my youngest aunt, who had -- I mean, one son passed away, unfortunately, but at that time she had two boys and her husband and they lived in an apartment, but she had a room for me.</span> <span id="s937">And we got along very well and I really was very happy, you know, be wi -- in her house.</span> <span id="s938">And during that time, my brother got married, my mother came to the wedding.</span> <span id="s939">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s940">Q: Your brother married an American?</span></p> <p><span id="s941">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: Yeah, got married here.</span> <span id="s944">And then, oh yeah, then I decided I wanted to stay here permanently, so -- but I was here on a temporary visa and the only way for me to remain, I either had to go to school or marry an American.</span> <span id="s945">So, I decided I would like to go to school.</span> <span id="s946">But then, you know, not every school is going to admit you and I wanted to go to a Yeshiva University.</span> <span id="s947">That’s a teacher’s institute for women, a Yeshiva University.</span> <span id="s948">So, I -- So -- I -- Then, at that time, I moved to another aunt of mine, who is not here any longer, Margaret and I went -- Manya, we used to call her, and she --</span></p> <p><span id="s949">Q: Manya?</span></p> <p><span id="s950">A: Manya, yeah.</span> <span id="s951">Russian name.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q: That’s pa -- a Russian --</span></p> <p><span id="s953">A: Russian name.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Q: And you’re speaking English now.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">A: I know.</span> <span id="s956">So I call her Margaret.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">Q: So where did you learn English?</span></p> <p><span id="s958">A: Oh, English.</span> <span id="s959">Oh, wa -- English, I learned in Cuba.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: Yes, right.</span> <span id="s962">I learned in Cuba, in my -- you know, my -- my courses, I took English.</span> <span id="s963">Just like I took shorthand and I took typing, you know, commercial course and everything else.</span> <span id="s964">And I took bookkeeping.</span> <span id="s965">You name it, I took a lot of things.</span> <span id="s966">And let’s see, where was I now?</span> <span id="s967">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s968">Q: Yeshiva.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">A: Okay, right.</span> <span id="s970">Okay, so -- so my Aunt Manya took me to meet her rabbi, who is now a -- a -- the chairman of the -- oh, what do you call this?</span> <span id="s971">Big organization, I just forgot the name of it, but okay, his name is Rabbi Arthur Schnier.</span> <span id="s972">And he really deals now, at the present time with -- with relationships between Judaism and Christian -- Christians, you know, yeah, he’s -- I forgot what he called it.</span> <span id="s973">I’ll tell you in a minute.</span> <span id="s974">[indecipherable] Yeah, okay, so I went and I met Rabbi Arthur Schnier and h-he was always involved in politics and he knew a lot of people in Washington and he knew a lot of people here.</span> <span id="s975">And anyway, my aunt told him the story, that I would like to remain in, you know, this country and I would like to go to school.</span> <span id="s976">And so my choice is Teacher’s Institute for Women, I would like to be a Hebrew teacher.</span> <span id="s977">And so he said, “Okay, I’ll see what I can do,” and he arranged for the Yeshiva to accept me, but before, I had to go through exam.</span> <span id="s978">Now, I never had any background in the Yeshiva or anything like that, but they gave me two weeks to prepare myself for the exam and I did very well, I was accepted.</span> <span id="s979">And after I was accepted, I -- I was going to -- to school three times a week and -- and I worked 20 hours a week.</span> <span id="s980">I was allowed to work 20 hours a week, so I always had, you know, a few dollars of my own.</span> <span id="s981">And I -- I-I met, in my class, my classmate.</span> <span id="s982">We became very good friends, with this young lady, her name was Sivia and she lived in Crown Heights, Brooklyn and she would occasionally invite me to her house for, you know, for the weekend.</span> <span id="s983">And then one day she said to me, “You know, I know s -- a very nice fellow I would like you to meet.”</span> <span id="s984">And I said, “Oh Sivia, I have so many blind dates.</span> <span id="s985">I really don’t want to meet any more.”</span> <span id="s986">And she said to me, “But he’s very nice, and I do want you to meet him.</span> <span id="s987">So, let me give him your telephone number and I’ll never bother you again.”</span> <span id="s988">Well, she gave Harry, my husband my telephone number, and he called me.</span> <span id="s989">So, we made a date, the day my brother was getting married.</span> <span id="s990">So he should come to the wedding and pick me up.</span> <span id="s991">And that’s what he did.</span> <span id="s992">And so, we met.</span> <span id="s993">And we went out and I guess there was something that we developed in common.</span> <span id="s994">And then, after, you know, dating him for about five months -- from January, February, March, April, May, June, five months and he never said anything.</span> <span id="s995">So, I said to myself, “Okay, I’ll make him talk.”</span> <span id="s996">I can’t go on, you know, I just come out and ask him, “Well, are we serious?</span> <span id="s997">I-Is -- I mean, are you interested in me or what?”</span> <span id="s998">So, I said to myself, “Okay, that gives me a chance to go back to visit my mother.”</span> <span id="s999">Okay?</span> <span id="s1000">And that wa -- no, the ma -- ma -- I’m sorry, my mother was here, the rest of the family, right.</span> <span id="s1001">I said, “Okay, I’m going to go to Cuba.”</span> <span id="s1002">And that’s what I did.</span> <span id="s1003">So, we were dating for f-five months, he said nothing, so I told him, “I’m going back to Cuba and -- and I’ll decide if I’m -- you know, I’ll think about if I’m coming back or not coming back, I’m --” this, that.</span> <span id="s1004">So, I went back to Cuba and he started writing letters.</span> <span id="s1005">Every day I would get a letter from him and telephone calls and this and that and this and that.</span> <span id="s1006">And then, in the meantime, I -- I was teaching in the -- in the Hebrew school in Cuba, Judaism.</span> <span id="s1007">And Labor day, my husband surprised me and came to visit me, to Cuba, and -- you know, in those days we had no jets.</span> <span id="s1008">I-It -- He had to fly four and a half hours -- five hours to get to Cuba from the u -- from New York.</span> <span id="s1009">But he came and he met the rest of the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">Q: This is in the early 60’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">A: Yup, this was -- This was in, yeah, 1960.</span> <span id="s1012">No, no, I’m sorry, 1959, no, 1959, because we got married in 1960.</span> <span id="s1013">1959, and then he came again Christmas -- Christmas weekend, you know, the same year, and he proposed.</span> <span id="s1014">And so, we got married --civilly married in Cuba that is.</span> <span id="s1015">And within three weeks, I was able to come into the United States as a resident, cause I married an American.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">Q: You didn’t go back because you had to, did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">A: No, I didn’t go back.</span> <span id="s1018">I remained --</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1020">To Cuba?</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">A: Oh, no, no, no, I just went for a visit.</span> <span id="s1022">And then -- but he, you know, a-a-after I married him, whatyoumacallit, legally, I become, automatically a resident of the United States, so I came in as a resident, within three weeks and then we got religiously married in April.</span> <span id="s1023">April 10th of 1960.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">Q: I want to ask you something about your relationship with your husband, when you were courting.</span> <span id="s1025">Did you speak to him about the -- your experiences, or did you speak to anyone about your experiences during the Nazi regime?</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">A: You know, it seems like all the survivors have the same problem.</span> <span id="s1027">After the war, when -- you know, when we came to Cuba, and my mother wanted to tell her sisters, as to what she went through during the war, you know, the Holocaust experience.</span> <span id="s1028">The first thing they said to her, “Don’t talk about it.</span> <span id="s1029">It is past, it’s finished with.</span> <span id="s1030">You are free.</span> <span id="s1031">Forget it.”</span> <span id="s1032">Now, you cannot forget it.</span> <span id="s1033">You cannot just push it away.</span> <span id="s1034">But -- Although they meant well, it wasn’t right.</span> <span id="s1035">And so the minute they said, “Don’t talk about it, it’s finished with, now you’re free, you’re here, everything will be all right.</span> <span id="s1036">That’s it.”</span> <span id="s1037">So we never spoke about it.</span> <span id="s1038">And when I was, you know, dating my husband or when I was with whomever I was, I f -- I didn’t want, A, to talk about it, because it’s very painful.</span> <span id="s1039">Every time I would start talking, I would start crying.</span> <span id="s1040">It’s only recently that I don’t cry as much and I think I ran out of -- of -- of tears.</span> <span id="s1041">But, that makes me sick.</span> <span id="s1042">Like, for example, you take this interview.</span> <span id="s1043">It’ll take me a week or 10 days for me to get back to be normal.</span> <span id="s1044">That means, I won’t sleep nights.</span> <span id="s1045">That means, it’s constantly even more so.</span> <span id="s1046">Although I live with this experience every day, by talking about it, it -- it intensifies and intensifies my whole system, my mind, my body, everything like, gets sick.</span> <span id="s1047">So, we didn’t talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">Q: When did you first begin to talk about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">A: I think maybe fif -- 10 years ago, 15 years ago, maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">Q: Before the interview with the Holocaust Museum?</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A: No, I think during that time, yeah.</span> <span id="s1052">I would say I would start talking about it -- was truly telling the story?</span> <span id="s1053">That was the first time I would sit and tell the story.</span> <span id="s1054">In between, I would tell my children, here and there a little bit.</span> <span id="s1055">Cause when they were small, I didn’t want to upset them.</span> <span id="s1056">I didn’t want them to be afraid of this world by thinking, “Oh, that’s what happened to my mother.</span> <span id="s1057">Might happen to me, too.”</span> <span id="s1058">So, I didn’t want them to live with that worry on their minds, so I kept quiet.</span> <span id="s1059">But, occasionally, things would happen so very quickly, I would say something, you know?</span> <span id="s1060">And that was that, you know, but they -- I never really sat down to tell them the story until I was interviewed by the -- by the museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">Q: Did you have -- I’ll -- We’ll go back to marriage.</span> <span id="s1062">We’ll -- We’ll never forget about marriage.</span> <span id="s1063">So that’ll be easy, well, that’ll be the next tape, but do you have -- you mentioned -- made reference to dreams or nightmares or -- about what sorts of things do you dream?</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">A: Well, you know, for many, many years after the war, I was always dreams.</span> <span id="s1065">I used to dream a lot about my father and just wake up screaming like -- I saw him as how he disappeared, you know?</span> <span id="s1066">I -- I -- I used to dream about the bombing.</span> <span id="s1067">I -- I used to -- to dream about suddenly finding myself alone, you know, nobody’s there but me, I’m alone.</span> <span id="s1068">I-I-I mean, you know, a lot of these things.</span> <span id="s1069">But then, it wasn’t already dreams, it’s reality, every day, see?</span> <span id="s1070">Every day, there is something that reminds me of my past.</span> <span id="s1071">So, although I don’t have as many dreams as I used to have, I am constantly reminded by different things that I come across.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">Q: Tell me what kind of things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">A: Well, the story with my cat who was killed while walking behind me.</span> <span id="s1074">And so I always, when I see a -- a Persian cat, i-it bothers me, you know, i-it really -- tears come to my eyes, because I always keep thinking, was that bullet meant for me, or was it truly meant for my cat?</span> <span id="s1075">And then, why should a cat be killed?</span> <span id="s1076">He did nothing.</span> <span id="s1077">I -- So, I -- I would just walk and -- and -- and -- and I’ll say to myself, “Oh, he looks just like my cat, my kitty.”</span> <span id="s1078">A-A-And then, I’ll hear a -- a German Shepherd bark and that’ll -- it’s like suddenly I find myself -- I have to hide.</span> <span id="s1079">Hey, but why am I hiding?</span> <span id="s1080">I am in a free country.</span> <span id="s1081">But that’s the feeling I get.</span> <span id="s1082">I-I-I see a fellow walking with that -- with that hat, that cap, a little raise up front like the German soldiers -- not the ger -- the SS would wear and I -- and I’ll say, “Ooh, is he one of them?”</span> <span id="s1083">I mean, i-it’s really crazy, but that’s -- that’s what this war did to you.</span> <span id="s1084">A -- A -- A barn, I -- I’ll walk by, I mean, you know, on the island, the houses and they have like little barns in the back and there goes the memory to when we were hiding and then we had to jump from -- fro -- from the attic of that barn and -- and run away because the Germans will -- while the Germans were breaking the door to get in to get us.</span> <span id="s1085">And w-we jumped down and we ran away.</span> <span id="s1086">A-And it’s, hey --</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">Q: Do you ever think of that little dog that kept you warm under the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s1089">That little dog.</span> <span id="s1090">The reason why I -- I think of him a lot is the fact that he was so good.</span> <span id="s1091">Can you imagine a dog would not bark when he sees me climbing in, you know?</span> <span id="s1092">And I would lie down and he would lie on my legs to keep me warm, because I had no blanket.</span> <span id="s1093">I told you, remember I was walking with knee-highs?</span> <span id="s1094">I had nothing to cover myself with.</span> <span id="s1095">An-And the lady didn’t know that I slept under her house with her dog.</span> <span id="s1096">And this dog just was so smart.</span> <span id="s1097">I would just climb in and lie down and he would right away lie down on my legs and keep me warm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">Q: Have you had pets since?</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Q: Do you think this -- there’s a reason for that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">A: Yeah, there is a reason, yeah.</span> <span id="s1102">See, I only had one doll in my life and that was the doll that my bro -- my father bought for me before the war.</span> <span id="s1103">I had a beautiful doll, a big one.</span> <span id="s1104">My father took me to this store that sold only dolls.</span> <span id="s1105">And he said to me, “You pick.”</span> <span id="s1106">And I was so little, but I picked this doll from the shelf and the doll was bigger than I was.</span> <span id="s1107">I couldn’t even carry the doll home, my sister had to carry it for me and the doll would sit on the rocking chair in the living room.</span> <span id="s1108">And this is the doll I took with me when we went to the ghetto, when we had to leave home.</span> <span id="s1109">And of course, you know, after -- after the pogrom, I never saw my doll again.</span> <span id="s1110">After that, I never had a doll again, that was finished.</span> <span id="s1111">Because I think that with the war, my childhood went, okay?</span> <span id="s1112">I-I think that the Holocaust killed my childhood, but did not kill my spirit and did not kill, you know, the rest of my life.</span> <span id="s1113">I -- I’m still alive an-and going strong.</span> <span id="s1114">A-And then after what happened to my cat, I never wanted one.</span> <span id="s1115">I always think about my cat, but I never wanted one.</span> <span id="s1116">And when I had my little boy, my youngest son, a neighbor of mine had a -- a Siamese cat and the Siamese cat gave birth to little Siamese kittens and she said, “Frima, you should have one for your child.</span> <span id="s1117">And I’m giving it to you for nothing and you know how expensive they are and you know how good they are, [indecipherable].”</span> <span id="s1118">“Okay,” I said, “Fine.”</span> <span id="s1119">So I got one for my -- for my son.</span> <span id="s1120">But, every so often, when I used to sit down and the cat would jump into my lap and I would, you know, caress him and I -- I would think about my -- my Persian cat a-and then I gave it away and I -- and I really, you know, I don’t want any -- any more, cause it’s -- it was a horrible experience, and -- and I used, you know, to dream about my cat and always used to scream and i-it was really bad, it was very a -- for a -- to a child it was terrible, you know, terrible shock, a-a-and -- and -- and the fact that -- that I let him die without even turning around looking at him or picking him up or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">Q: So having -- Part of what has happened through your whole experience, is hiding your feelings?</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s1123">It was always -- no one should know you are Jewish.</span> <span id="s1124">It’s like you have some kind of a disease.</span> <span id="s1125">I mean, to go as far as to know, at the age of six, that if I should turn around an-an-and -- and talk to my cat or pick up my cat or caress my cat or whatever, that the Germans will know I’m Jewish.</span> <span id="s1126">I -- I mean, that takes an awful lot of -- out of you of -- of saying, what am I, am I not human?</span> <span id="s1127">I mean, who am I?</span> <span id="s1128">What am I?</span> <span id="s1129">Am I -- Am I a -- some kind of a disease to the world?</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">Q: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Frima Laub, conducted by Ginger Miles, on November 23rd, 1998.</span> <span id="s1132">This is tape number three, side A.</span> <span id="s1133">Now we did get briefly into marriage.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">Q: You were married in 1960, and then -- in a civil ceremony, and when you came back to America --</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">A: No, ninet -- no, civil ceremony, 1959, okay?</span> <span id="s1137">Then, three weeks later, we came to the United States and we set a date for April the 10th, 1960, to be married.</span> <span id="s1138">And, at that time, my mother was here already.</span> <span id="s1139">My sister was in Cuba and she did not make it to the wedding, but my brother was here, my aunts and my uncles and everybody was at the wedding and it was just very lovely.</span> <span id="s1140">Was just the immediate family.</span> <span id="s1141">Course, we couldn’t afford a wedding -- my mother, that is, couldn’t afford a wedding.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">Q: Do you remember the rabbi?</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">Q: But he was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">A: 39 years ago and -- and I didn’t even get married in my neighborhood, I got married in my husband’s neighborhood, which was Lower East Side, okay?</span> <span id="s1148">Clinton Plaza, which is -- does not exist any longer.</span> <span id="s1149">But, it wa --</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">Q: And you moved with him somewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">A: Oh well, we moved to Brooklyn, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">Q: Brooklyn.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">A: We moved to Brooklyn.</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">Q: Where you lived for a long time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">A: Oh yes, we lived in Brooklyn for about 30 some odd years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">Q: What section?</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">A: Flatbush, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">Q: And your children, you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">A: My children -- I have three children.</span> <span id="s1160">I have -- My daughter’s the oldest, Linda and then I have Myron, he is the middle child and then I have Avi, who’s the little one.</span> <span id="s1161">And they were all born in Brooklyn -- oh no, with the exception -- my boys were born in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s1162">My daughter was born in Beth Israel, in New York.</span> <span id="s1163">And then we moved to -- to Windmere.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">Q: I want to ask you, before we -- because this getting married brings up the subject of -- of where you get married, which brings up the subject of identity as a religious Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">Q: Has this been a part -- an important part of your experience, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">A: An important part of survival.</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">Q: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">A: Well, you see, by believing that God will help you and that there’s someone watching over you, that was a -- a tremendous help for a child to survive.</span> <span id="s1170">Because, although I was -- you know, I had no mother with me, I had no one, I was alone, I knew God will help me.</span> <span id="s1171">And I did my praying every night, as you know that my mother left me the hundred rubles, and after the second lady, the one who shaved my head because I was infested with lice, because here and there, I didn’t have a shower or a bath or anything like that and I slept with mice crawling over me.</span> <span id="s1172">I -- I bought a cross for the hundred rubles.</span> <span id="s1173">Now, I knew that the reason why I need the cross is in case I’m stopped by someone and they will accuse me of being a Jew, I can prove I’m not, cause I wanted to live.</span> <span id="s1174">But, I also knew that Christianity is not me.</span> <span id="s1175">I’m a Jew and I have my own prayers and I have to say those prayers and I have to talk to God and he will help me.</span> <span id="s1176">And that’s exactly what I did.</span> <span id="s1177">Every night, when I climbed in, you know, in -- one, two o’clock in the morning when I climbed in to my -- my -- my doggy, to sleep with, I would take off my cross and in Hebrew I would say my prayers, those prayers that my mother taught me when I was a little girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">Q: Do you remember one of the prayers now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">A: Well, the prayers, it is called, Creat schma.</span> <span id="s1180">It’s a prayer before you go to sleep, okay?</span> <span id="s1181">So, I would say Creat schma.</span> <span id="s1182">And then in the morning, when I would get up and -- and shake off the hay, because we slept -- the dog and I slept on the hay, okay?</span> <span id="s1183">And I shake off the hay and -- and got myself, you know, straightened out, I should -- shouldn’t look like I c-come hiding from someplace, put my scarf on.</span> <span id="s1184">I would say, Moday ani.</span> <span id="s1185">Moday ani is a Jew -- is a Hebrew prayer where I thank you God for -- that I’m -- that I got up, that I survived another day, that I’m here.</span> <span id="s1186">And then after that, I would put the cross on again.</span> <span id="s1187">Now, I knew the reason why I was wearing a cross, not because I was giving away my belief, but because, if I’m a Christian, I can survive.</span> <span id="s1188">I will not be killed.</span> <span id="s1189">Where, if I’m a Jew, I haven’t got a chance.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">Q: And today, are you active in a spiritual, religious community?</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1192">I am a religious Jew.</span> <span id="s1193">I remained religious all through the Holocaust, after the Holocaust, the way I am now.</span> <span id="s1194">And I -- I truly feel, and that is my -- my very deep belief that there was and there is someone above me who guided me to do all these things that I did to survive.</span> <span id="s1195">I was only five years old and I acted as if I was someone of 50.</span> <span id="s1196">And I was six year old, I did things like a six year old person.</span> <span id="s1197">So, there’s got to be s -- a power over me, making me do things.</span> <span id="s1198">Giving me that -- that -- that intelligence.</span> <span id="s1199">I mean, I -- I -- I look at my grandchild, five years old and I say, “Oh my God, Oh my God.</span> <span id="s1200">Please God,” and I always pray to God, “May -- May no child know of -- of -- of such horrors.”</span> <span id="s1201">But they could never survive, because they never think the way I thought.</span> <span id="s1202">Now, did I think because I was a genius?</span> <span id="s1203">No, it’s because there’s something that I can not explain.</span> <span id="s1204">But I feel it.</span> <span id="s1205">So, with the sad life and the hard life and the disappointments in life, I always feel that I’m rewarded by God.</span> <span id="s1206">I really do.</span> <span id="s1207">And I always thank God for everything.</span> <span id="s1208">After the meals, I thank God.</span> <span id="s1209">When I light my candles, I thank God.</span> <span id="s1210">Whatever there is, I always pray, but when I pray, I really pray with my heart.</span> <span id="s1211">And I -- And I -- And I remember wh-wh-when I was that little girl, that five, six year old girl and -- and I was all alone, I never felt alone.</span> <span id="s1212">I always felt that there’s someone watching over me.</span> <span id="s1213">A-A-And this is something that’s -- I think it’s extremely important to a child.</span> <span id="s1214">Not to feel alone.</span> <span id="s1215">Yeah, I was frightened, but I always knew that there’s a salvation, you know?</span> <span id="s1216">Because I was praying, because I was talking and -- and, you know, to God.</span> <span id="s1217">And -- And this is -- That’s a wonderful way of surviving.</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">Q: It’s -- It’s is -- It is to some and -- and then to others, their response has been totally different.</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">A: Unfortunately, yes.</span> <span id="s1220">And you can not blame those people, no.</span> <span id="s1221">Cause they went -- the horrors were -- are absolutely -- you can’t understand the horrors.</span> <span id="s1222">I-I-I-It -- Your mind just can not absorb or understand that such a thing exists, and -- and -- and someth -- and one human does it to another and -- and the victim did nothing.</span> <span id="s1223">Simply because he is a Jew?</span> <span id="s1224">So what does it mean?</span> <span id="s1225">It -- Because a Jew?</span> <span id="s1226">What is it, no good?</span> <span id="s1227">What are we -- are we -- am I diseased?</span> <span id="s1228">A-Am I -- Di-Did I kill someone?</span> <span id="s1229">Why such hatred?</span> <span id="s1230">Why such hostility?</span> <span id="s1231">Crime.</span> <span id="s1232">I mean, so much.</span> <span id="s1233">Y-You probably heard it, that when we were standing ar -- I mean, I don’t know if you want to hear it, when we were standing on line to be killed, the first pogrom, a-and we were in like maybe two or three people ahead of us, we were all in line, you know, with our underwear only, waiting to be killed.</span> <span id="s1234">We had those killing squads.</span> <span id="s1235">There was a mother holding a little baby, right?</span> <span id="s1236">And this German walks over to her, a-and wants to take the baby away from her.</span> <span id="s1237">She wouldn’t let him.</span> <span id="s1238">And there was a whole struggle going on and I’m standing there in shock.</span> <span id="s1239">I didn’t know wha -- a -- a -- a -- I didn’t believe my own eyes, I-I mean -- so, you’re talking about a five year old kid standing there and watching that -- this German is trying to take the baby away from the mother and the mother wouldn’t let.</span> <span id="s1240">So he pulls the baby towards him and she pulls the baby towards her, right?</span> <span id="s1241">There’s how.</span> <span id="s1242">Finally, he got the baby out of her arms, pi-picks up his -- his -- his leg, yeah, with those boots up there and breaks the baby’s back and gives it back to the ba -- to the mother.</span> <span id="s1243">Are these atrocities?</span> <span id="s1244">Who can forget this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">Q: Does this make you bitter and angry over other things in your life, I mean.</span> <span id="s1246">Are you angry at --</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">A: I’m angry at the world, yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">Q: The religious Christians?</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">A: I-I -- I don’t know if I’m exactly picking out religious, non-religious.</span> <span id="s1250">I’m just angry at the world, simply because the world didn’t even try to save some children.</span> <span id="s1251">There’s a million and a half children slaughtered for nothing and nobody tried to help them.</span> <span id="s1252">That’s what I’m angry about.</span> <span id="s1253">Has nothing to do with religion or not religion.</span> <span id="s1254">Just as a human being, how could you not try to do something?</span> <span id="s1255">Maybe -- M-Maybe they -- they couldn’t saved everyone, but some?</span> <span id="s1256">And do you remember that there was that ship, Saint Louis, that had 900 -- 850 or 900 German Jews from the high society, you are talking the wealthy people, they’re educated people, doctors and dentists and engineers and you name it.</span> <span id="s1257">And the United States didn’t want to let them in.</span> <span id="s1258">A handful of people, 900 people they didn’t want to let them in and then, when they went to Cuba, Cuba said, “Hey, the United States is not letting them in, why should I bother?”</span> <span id="s1259">They are a little, small country.</span> <span id="s1260">They didn’t let them in, either.</span> <span id="s1261">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">Q: Where were you [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">A: I was in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">Q: You were in Europe when this happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1266">This was -- This must have been in 1940 when the ship came around.</span> <span id="s1267">And nobody wanted that ship with the 900 Jews.</span> <span id="s1268">So, you see why I’m angry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">Q: Oh --</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">A: It’s the world.</span> <span id="s1271">It’s not just particular people.</span> <span id="s1272">And nobody -- And they went back to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">Q: Do you remember who was president when you first came here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">A: Well, during the war, Frankwi -- Franklin Roosevelt was president during World War Two.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">Q: Do you remember impressions about him?</span> <span id="s1276">Family impressions?</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">A: Well, let me tell you the following.</span> <span id="s1278">I’m -- After the war -- after the war, I -- remember I told you my house was always open, people used to come and go and have a cup of tea and have soup.</span> <span id="s1279">I was then eight years old, nine years old.</span> <span id="s1280">I -- I would hear how the older -- you know, the older survivors would talk.</span> <span id="s1281">And then I first realized what they were talking about.</span> <span id="s1282">They were saying that what happened to the president of the United States.</span> <span id="s1283">That the United States did nothing.</span> <span id="s1284">That Roosevelt obviously didn’t care much about Jews.</span> <span id="s1285">So, that’s the only thing that I began to understand.</span> <span id="s1286">That there was such a thing as a president and the president just didn’t care about the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">Q: So, you did -- you were aware that survivors then, only talked to each other about the experience.</span> <span id="s1288">You did hear other surviv -- older survivors talking, and that was the only time it was every discussed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">A: That’s it.</span> <span id="s1290">That’s is.</span> <span id="s1291">They were talking, saying that nobody was there to help the Jews.</span> <span id="s1292">There was nobody except God, and that was that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">Q: There’s a list of different things that happened in -- in the world history, but especially in the -- in the American history, that I’d like to read to you to see if any of these things you connected with your experience and with that experience and -- and if you didn’t, we’ll just move on, you know, but I -- I think the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">A: Are you talking about now or when I was 10 years old?</span> <span id="s1295">What are we talking -- I mean, talking about how I felt --</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">Q: Well, I’ll --</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">A: Yeah, go ahead, read it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">Q: This is one example, the Japanese concentration camps that happened in America.</span> <span id="s1299">You might have been not here, or [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">A: I heard of them, but there is no comparisons.</span> <span id="s1301">No comparisons whatsoever.</span> <span id="s1302">The concentration camps that the Germans built, nobody builds concentration camps like they do.</span> <span id="s1303">And the atrocities that they committed, no one that I know of today, does what they did then.</span> <span id="s1304">Now, concentration camp might have different meanings, see?</span> <span id="s1305">The concentration camps of the Chinese people here, that the one you’re talking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">Q: Yeah, Japanese camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">A: Japanese, oh, okay, was a camp where the people, because of the war with Japan, the government wanted to make sure that these people do not commit terrorism and therefore, it was a camp for people to concentrate.</span> <span id="s1308">But there were no killings, there were no atrocities.</span> <span id="s1309">There were no starvation.</span> <span id="s1310">There were no beatings.</span> <span id="s1311">There were no ripping apart human -- person apart.</span> <span id="s1312">Or pulling his a -- eyes out or pulling his teeth out or ripping him to pieces w-while he’s alive and burning him to death.</span> <span id="s1313">So, how can we compare a United States camp, which is a camp just to make sure that these people do not commit terrorism, compared to a concentration camp -- a German concentration camp where there -- the idea was to annihilate people.</span> <span id="s1314">To get rid of them as quickly as possible and to do a lot of -- what do we call it, experiments.</span> <span id="s1315">Do you know that they -- they used the skin to make lampshades?</span> <span id="s1316">And -- And some other things?</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">Q: So, I want to ask you, Frima, cause I’m trying to focus on -- on -- on your -- your particular experience and that is -- so, in your life, are there things, like in your job that you do right now, or that in the work that you’ve had or in your attitudes toward people, or homeless or -- that relate, that are inspired by that experience?</span> <span id="s1318">I hate to use the word inspired, but -- but are -- are you motivated still today in constructive ways?</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">A: Very much so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">Q: Could you tell me a little bit about what you’re doing today that -- or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">A: You see, somehow my -- my sad life and my experience, all this still left me with a very good heart.</span> <span id="s1322">And -- And it just doesn’t matter to me if I’m dealing with a person from any nationality.</span> <span id="s1323">I-It just doesn’t matter.</span> <span id="s1324">It’s just the fact that I want to help and it’s the right thing to do.</span> <span id="s1325">It’s to help another human being, cause we all belong to God and we all his children and we should help each other.</span> <span id="s1326">And so, as hard as my life was -- but there were some of those good Gentile people that helped me.</span> <span id="s1327">So, I-I never thought otherwise, this how I’m supposed to be and this is how every person should be.</span> <span id="s1328">And -- And you probably heard or maybe I didn’t mention to you, that when we came back, you know, after the war, after liberation, we came back home an-and remember I told you there was a Gentile man that, when I was alone and I was starved and I needed food, I -- I went to him and I told him I was hungry, so he offered me a glass of milk, a piece of black bread and a piece of pork.</span> <span id="s1329">And I, as a Jew, in whose house we had no pork, I had the milk, I had the bread, but I wouldn’t touch the pork.</span> <span id="s1330">And I never told him why, cause I’m not supposed to tell him.</span> <span id="s1331">I just eat what he gave me and I thanked him and I loved him for it.</span> <span id="s1332">Also, the first pogrom, when we ran away, we met in his house, you know, we are supposed to an-and we did, we met in his house an-and he let us stay overnight in his cellar and I remember the rats were running all over us, but we stayed at night there.</span> <span id="s1333">Now, when we came back -- after liberation we came back home, we were notified by his wife that the Russian government wants to put him in jail because he was -- he was an informant and -- yeah, he was an informant and we don’t really know what happened, what he did, because we were in Romania, right?</span> <span id="s1334">So, we don’t know what happened here.</span> <span id="s1335">But I remember that he was good to us and his wife said, “If you child will go to court and tell them how he treated you and your family, they will let him go, he won’t have to go to jail.”</span> <span id="s1336">Well, I did.</span> <span id="s1337">My mother took me to court and I remember it was a round room.</span> <span id="s1338">And in the middle there was a chair and I climbed on the chair and I stood and told them that this man saved my life, because I was starved and he gave me food to eat.</span> <span id="s1339">And the night that we had no place where to go, we came to him and he let us -- and they let him free.</span> <span id="s1340">So, you see, when somebody does good for you, you learn something from it and you try to do the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">Q: And you still have kosher household -- kitchen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">A: Yeah, yup.</span> <span id="s1343">It’s still a kosher home and my children follow me in the same footsteps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">Q: So your children also married Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">A: Yes, they all married to Jewish boys, Jewish girls and -- and that’s how they bring up their children and that -- that’s a blessing for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">Q: Can you see them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">Q: You see them often?</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">A: Absolutely, we see them and we talk to each other.</span> <span id="s1350">And it’s wonderful to have grandchildren and I feel especially blessed, you know, that when Hitler thought he’ll get rid of me, look, I brought up two generations.</span> <span id="s1351">And I was a step ahead of my enemy, all the time, see?</span> <span id="s1352">And that is something that I feel that I-I couldn’t have done it on my own.</span> <span id="s1353">And I had no -- no one to tell me what to do, right?</span> <span id="s1354">Except God was telling me what to do and that’s what I did, and here I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">Q: And -- And I -- I get the feeling you also have non-Jewish friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">A: Oh yeah, oh sure I do.</span> <span id="s1357">What --</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">Q: And your work now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">A: -- why not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">Q: Well yeah, why not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">A: They all wonderful.</span> <span id="s1362">You see, I look at people, not at their beliefs or their color or their race.</span> <span id="s1363">I look at people.</span> <span id="s1364">There are good people and there are bad people and I love to work with a lot of different people.</span> <span id="s1365">And I love -- I have neighbors, all kinds of neighbors.</span> <span id="s1366">I have a Yugoslavian neighbor, an Italian neighbor, a Jewish neighbor, another Italian neighbor and I love them.</span> <span id="s1367">And we get along so well.</span> <span id="s1368">And why not?</span> <span id="s1369">That’s how is has to be.</span> <span id="s1370">Maybe if -- if we would only try to be good to each other, the world will be a better world to live in and then we wouldn’t let these things happen, these atrocities and some of them are happening today in the other countries, yugos -- what was it?</span> <span id="s1371">In -- In -- In --</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">A: Europe there someplace.</span> <span id="s1374">It’s horrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">Q: So, where do you work today?</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">A: I work in a mental health clinic.</span> <span id="s1377">Mostly we deal with children and some adults.</span> <span id="s1378">People who are depressed, people who have problems with their children, hyperactive children.</span> <span id="s1379">But I like my job.</span> <span id="s1380">I like it very much, cause I love to look at the children and I always say, “I hope they never go through horrors like we did in Europe.”</span> <span id="s1381">I always pray for these children.</span> <span id="s1382">And I love it.</span> <span id="s1383">I like to work.</span> <span id="s1384">I like to be with young people.</span> <span id="s1385">The thought of retiring scares me.</span> <span id="s1386">Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">Q: Well, when -- when you -- when we part today, after this interview, are you going to have someone to talk to about any extra experiences that you thought in your mind, that came to you?</span> <span id="s1388">Would you talk to your husband or any of your children or any of your friend survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">A: To talk to them about today?</span> <span id="s1390">Well the rest of the month --</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">Q: Well, about whatever comes up afterwards.</span> <span id="s1392">You said often, you said maybe for a week or 10 days --</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">A: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">Q: -- you would be thinking about things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">A: Oh yeah, I’ll be -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1396">Maybe.</span> <span id="s1397">You know, the children ha -- are busy with their own lives.</span> <span id="s1398">Friends are busy with their own lives.</span> <span id="s1399">The husband comes home, he -- he -- he -- he has so many responsibilities at work.</span> <span id="s1400">The only way that I will handle my frustration and my sadness and then, you know, and everything else that this would leave me with, is I will just start writing and maybe someday, I would like to publish a book.</span> <span id="s1401">And -- And -- And that’s what I’m going to do.</span> <span id="s1402">I -- I do want to leave a book out there for the children.</span> <span id="s1403">For elementary school children, for high school children, so they can see that there is strength and when you have belief, that helps and you can do -- you -- you ca -- you can do a lot of things when you have to.</span> <span id="s1404">You also have to believe in your parents and you have to believe in God.</span> <span id="s1405">I -- I -- And -- And you can do, you know, things which, later on you will ask, “How did I do it?”</span> <span id="s1406">But -- But you’ll do it and you will survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">Q: Well, you certainly are a great inspiration, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">A: Thank you, thank you, thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">Q: I think there’s -- there’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">A: Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">Q: -- there’s so much more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">A: A lot, a lot.</span> <span id="s1413">A lot more.</span> <span id="s1414">So -- End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">Q: This is the final side, B, of tape three, Frima Laub and we’re about to complete the interview, due to time constrictions, but I did want to ask about your mother.</span> <span id="s1416">You mentioned on the 1990 interview, that your mother suffered from the day she died.</span> <span id="s1417">And I wondered if you -- this triggers back to the -- her experience in the Holocaust, or did you mean physical suffering, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">A: Well, my mother really never got over the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1419">Sh-She just never was able to recuperate.</span> <span id="s1420">A, a-as you know, as a mother, she -- she lost her husband.</span> <span id="s1421">She was a very young widow.</span> <span id="s1422">Then she went through all this and she was the one who had to make all the plans for our escape.</span> <span id="s1423">She did all this, you know, the plans.</span> <span id="s1424">You know, you -- you probably know that we were also in jail for awhile, okay.</span> <span id="s1425">I mean, she made all these -- these plans of how to escape and where to run and what to say and where to -- where to go, because we were children.</span> <span id="s1426">I was a little nothing and my dau -- my sister was 10 years older than I was, so she was still a child.</span> <span id="s1427">So, my mother had to use all this.</span> <span id="s1428">Then, the first pogrom, I-I -- I told you, when -- when the Germans were taking off the jewelry, whatever the -- the women or the men wo-wore, jewelry, rings, i-if you didn’t take it off by yourself quick enough and they wanted the ring, they would rip it off with your finger.</span> <span id="s1429">And -- And if -- And if you didn’t take off your earrings fast enough, they would rip off, you know, the ear or the loop -- or the loop where -- which -- which you were -- with -- with that earring.</span> <span id="s1430">And my mother wasn’t fast enough, so -- so one -- one SS hit her with a -- with a rifle -- with the end of the rifle, he hit her so hard over the he -- over the ear, that she fell down.</span> <span id="s1431">And -- And she was always deaf on this ear.</span> <span id="s1432">She couldn’t -- My mother never recuperated.</span> <span id="s1433">And she always used to say, because -- I mean -- and I’m saying I think since -- when she arrived, when I arrived in Cuba, she wanted to tell her sisters what she went through and they said to her, “Don’t talk about it.”</span> <span id="s1434">She felt very -- like very explosive inside, where she wanted to talk about it, but -- but the sisters said, “Don’t talk about it.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">Q: So she had no one to talk to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">A: Never talked to.</span> <span id="s1437">But, to me she would -- every -- well, I was the one who was the closest to her and I was with her all the time and she would alway say, “The world should know, Frima.</span> <span id="s1438">The world should know.”</span> <span id="s1439">You know, like this.</span> <span id="s1440">And we would never talk, like -- there were a lot of questions I wanted to ask my mother, you know, as I grew older, but then I didn’t want to upset her, because I knew how much she was suffering with -- with everything that -- everything that she went through and she -- in her own way, she went through a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">Q: Is she passed on now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">A: Oh, my mother passed on in -- she died in 1980.</span> <span id="s1443">No, I’m -- excuse me, that’s my mother-in-law died in 1980 and my brother died in 1980.</span> <span id="s1444">My mother died in 1993.</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">Q: So she outlived her son?</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1447">He died --</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">Q: ‘93, she lived a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">A: In 1993, she was 87.</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">Q: Yeah, she lived a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1451">A: And my brother died very young.</span> <span id="s1452">He was 56.</span> <span id="s1453">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">Q: But do you think she had no one to talk to about the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">A: Not really, no.</span> <span id="s1456">Not really.</span> <span id="s1457">Unfortunately, not really.</span> <span id="s1458">And you see, in those days, they -- they were not interviewing yet, you know, like -- so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">Q: It wasn’t popular to talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">A: R -- Thank you.</span> <span id="s1461">Okay, so she really never got a chance to tell her side of the story.</span> <span id="s1462">But she used to tell me, “Frima, make sure the world knows.</span> <span id="s1463">Make sure the world knows.”</span> <span id="s1464">Like she also never went into details, but she, “Make sure.”</span> <span id="s1465">Like, in Yiddish, the world should know, -- Voos meels anan ibigigania -- what we went through.</span> <span id="s1466">Cause she didn’t speak too much English, so in Yiddish she would say, “What we went through, the world should know.”</span> <span id="s1467">And that’s that.</span> <span id="s1468">She would -- She certainly --</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">Q: So she died to this -- speaking Yiddish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">A: Oh yeah, she died speaking Yiddish, she died speaking Russian.</span> <span id="s1471">Yeah, she spoke Russian and she spoke Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1472">And she was younger, she spoke Ukrainian, she spoke Polish.</span> <span id="s1473">My mother spoke a lot of languages.</span> <span id="s1474">My father spoke many languages, too, that’s why he was an interpreter to the Germans.</span> <span id="s1475">He spoke about six, seven languages.</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">Q: [indecipherable] I want to thank you so

id="s1480">Anytime.</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">Q: We’ll be waiting for this book.</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1483">I -- I hope you can han -- give me a hand on that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">Q: I hope we could.</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">A: If you do, I’ll -- I’ll be very grateful --</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">Q: Grateful to you.</span></p>

with Frima Laub</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">June 3, 1999 Beginning Tape Four, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">Question: This is tape one, side A, of a second audio follow up interview with Frima Laub, conducted by Ginger Miles, on June third, 1999, for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.</span> <span id="s1492">The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making this interview possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">Answer: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1494">Well, for on the last interview -- interview that we had a few months ago, it took me about almost two weeks to recuperate.</span> <span id="s1495">I -- you know, I got -- I’m very upset.</span> <span id="s1496">It leaves me very upset, and I do dream about, you know, certain happenings in those -- in those days, in those years.</span> <span id="s1497">And -- But now, I guess, a few months later, I’m ready to talk again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">Q: This time may be easier, because we’re not going to have to go through all the -- the childhood experience --</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">Q: -- but the -- your experience since that time.</span> <span id="s1501">One of the things that we’re very interested in is, when you dream, what do you dream about?</span> <span id="s1502">What part of the experience keeps coming back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">A: The different -- you know, different happenings.</span> <span id="s1504">It’s where -- I’ll dream that there’s a knock on the door.</span> <span id="s1505">I-- I’ll dream that s -- you know, s -- the dogs are following me.</span> <span id="s1506">You know, the German Shepherds.</span> <span id="s1507">So, it’s really different things.</span> <span id="s1508">I -- I -- I’ll dream that I’m -- you know, I’m -- I’m walking in the street and -- and -- and, you know, how frightened I -- I am.</span> <span id="s1509">It’s just different -- different things that happen.</span> <span id="s1510">Of course, with each dream, I get up, I’m very upset.</span> <span id="s1511">Or many times I’ll just wake up, you know, after I have the dream, or if I ha -- if I’m screaming or I’m crying or something, I just wake up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">Q: And this 10 days, does that -- since our -- our first interview, did you -- did you wake up every night with dreams, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">A: Well, not every night.</span> <span id="s1514">I was upset every day.</span> <span id="s1515">It’s like -- i-it’s in front of you all the time, because when I talk about it, I relive those days, that time, you know.</span> <span id="s1516">So it’s like -- Well, actually, I live with it every day, even if I don’t talk about it.</span> <span id="s1517">As I walk the streets, if I hear a German Shepherd bark, right away it goes back to what happened to me in the past.</span> <span id="s1518">Something very funny, if I see a-an army officer or someone who wears, you know, the hats that -- that the officer wear, and it’s high up front, they remind me very much of the Gestapo hats, and this upsets me.</span> <span id="s1519">Then, since we live not too far from the airport -- I told you that last time, many times, I don’t know what, but suddenly there’s that noise, and that noise reminds me, after the war, for about one year, maybe a little longer, the Germans used to come in like 30 - 40 planes, to bomb the city where I lived.</span> <span id="s1520">And so, as they were coming, there was the tremendous noise.</span> <span id="s1521">And at the airport here, I can hear it too, and I don’t know, I don’t understand why this -- you know, why this noise comes from the airport.</span> <span id="s1522">And I get very upset, because I open the door and I will look up to the sky, like thinking that a plane’s coming in to bomb the city, God forbid.</span> <span id="s1523">Oh my God, that’s terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">Q: Now, what town were you in, the first year after liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">A: Well, after liberation, we were, at that time in occupied Romania, okay?</span> <span id="s1526">Okay?</span> <span id="s1527">We were in occupied Romania, but then, after the liberation, we went back to the Ukraine and this is where we stayed.</span> <span id="s1528">This is where my home was, once upon a time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">Q: I remember in our first tape, you discussed how your mother never got over the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">Q: And there seemed to be a sense of incompleteness --</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1533">Q: -- in you, not -- not being able to talk with your mother about her experiences during the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1534">Could you talk a little bit about your relationship with your mother and if you ever were able to discuss the Holocaust with her?</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">A: No.</span> <span id="s1536">We were never able to talk about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1537">She would talk about it, and you know, not much.</span> <span id="s1538">It -- I think what happened is, remember I mentioned to you that when we came to Cuba, after -- after the war, after we left Germany, and we went to Cuba because my mother had one of her sisters living there.</span> <span id="s1539">Actually, we were supposed to come into the United States, but because there was a delay and my mother somewheres heard that there’s going to be a World War Three, and she became panicky, she wanted to get out of Europe.</span> <span id="s1540">So she wrote to her sister and her sister quickly made out the papers, and we came to Cuba.</span> <span id="s1541">When we came to Cuba, my aunts from the United States, also came to Cuba, to greet is when we arrived, which was wonderful, and was a beautiful, sunny day.</span> <span id="s1542">It really was gorgeous.</span> <span id="s1543">And my mother wanted to tell them about our experience, about her experience and -- and everything that we went through, and all they said is, “Don’t talk about it.</span> <span id="s1544">It’s finished with, it’s -- it’s gone, it’s passe.</span> <span id="s1545">Now you’re in a free country, you’re with your family, you have nothing to fear, and we don’t tal -- you don’t tal -- you don’t -- you shouldn’t be talking about it because there’s nothing to talk about, finished.”</span> <span id="s1546">So, I guess, after that, she was sort of, you know, she wouldn’t talk about it much.</span> <span id="s1547">But occasionally, I would hear her say, remember, you know, “Remember Frima, remember?”</span> <span id="s1548">I do.</span> <span id="s1549">I do remember very much.</span> <span id="s1550">So we never really sat and spoke about it.</span> <span id="s1551">It’s like she remembered her life and I remembered my life.</span> <span id="s1552">And -- A-And -- And also, I remember distinctly that -- i-in those days -- I mean, you’re talking about what, 40 years ago, or 50 years ago?</span> <span id="s1553">It was something that if we did -- if she said, “Remember this?”</span> <span id="s1554">And I said, “Yes,” I would start crying right away.</span> <span id="s1555">So, it was something that you just couldn’t talk about it.</span> <span id="s1556">Besides, it was always in my mind you’re not supposed to talk about it, because it’s already past.</span> <span id="s1557">So, we didn’t really discuss it, we didn’t really talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">Q: Why do you think your relatives didn’t want to hear -- was there a deeper reason, or did they have fear?</span> <span id="s1559">A: No, I-I-I-I think -- I mean, my aunts were loving, loving aunts, and I had a loving family.</span> <span id="s1560">I think they just didn’t want my mother to get upset every time she talks about it.</span> <span id="s1561">Cause there was a lot to be upset about.</span> <span id="s1562">I mean, we lost a big family, including my father, a grandmother, a -- aunts, uncles, cousins.</span> <span id="s1563">We lost a lot of people, so I -- I think that this must have been the reason why they said, “Let’s not talk about it.</span> <span id="s1564">You’re in the free country now, you understand?</span> <span id="s1565">It’s finished, it’s gone and you’re safe with us.</span> <span id="s1566">That’s it.”</span> <span id="s1567">And I’m no -- a -- a -- I really don’t know if it would have been better talking about it, or was it better not to talk about it?</span> <span id="s1568">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1569">All I know is, whenever I used to think about it, I would cry.</span> <span id="s1570">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">Q: Well, being an objective observer of the situation, and not knowing your aunts, with all respect to your family, it sounds like a very selfish decision.</span> <span id="s1572">A -- A self protect -- that they were protecting themselves from hearing the horrors of what -- of what happened.</span> <span id="s1573">What do you think about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">A: That -- Well, i-it, you know, everything is possible.</span> <span id="s1575">I never really asked them why, you know.</span> <span id="s1576">But, as I said, because I know that they cared a lot about us, maybe they didn’t want to hear the horrors, and the true of the matter is, there were a lot of horrors.</span> <span id="s1577">I mean, frightening things.</span> <span id="s1578">It’s just like I was afraid to tell my children when they were little, because I didn’t want them to think that this is what’s going to happen to them.</span> <span id="s1579">So, I didn’t tell my children anything.</span> <span id="s1580">I-In fact, my kids, you know, when you’re used to -- to a mother with an accent, they just thought, you know, this is -- it’s normal, and -- and then, you know, later on in life, when they did hear about the Holocaust, and every so often I would tell them a little bit, because I felt that when they were teenagers already, they wouldn’t be so afraid.</span> <span id="s1581">I mean, this is just -- unfor -- an unfortunate happening that happened.</span> <span id="s1582">Happened to the mother, happened to the grandmother, and happened to the ga -- to -- to their great-grandmothers.</span> <span id="s1583">So -- I did, but -- I did, you know, occasionally tell them here and there a little bit, but the -- really, the horrors, the horrors?</span> <span id="s1584">No, I didn’t tell them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">Q: How did they find out about the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">A: Well, you know, as they were growing older, they heard about it, and then I would occasionally tell them, “Listen, I was in Europe and there was a war and this is what happened,” -- you know, happened here and there, but I didn’t really go into details.</span> <span id="s1587">You know, really them -- the frightening, the horrible things, I never told them.</span> <span id="s1588">You know, I was, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">Q: What do you think they would learn out of listening to one of the -- the last tape that we made, that --cause you -- I sent you copies, correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">A: Mm-hm, yeah, thank you, yes [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">Q: What do you think they would --</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">A: Well, you know, what they learn is that A, you have to learn to respect all kinds of nationalities, all kinds of people, and that you really have to keep your eyes open against different types of groups, those hate groups, which I think the United States sort of ignores.</span> <span id="s1593">We ignore, and we have them right here, in the United States, in this beautiful, free country, we giving everyone freedom, including the terrorist, the criminals.</span> <span id="s1594">And all these groups, we ignoring them.</span> <span id="s1595">But little by little, they are just getting bigger and bigger, and we don’t know what the future will bring, how they will react.</span> <span id="s1596">Because that’s how it started in Germany, with Hitler.</span> <span id="s1597">He was a nobody, and then he suddenly became a somebody.</span> <span id="s1598">So, it’s -- it’s something that I think they would just learn to keep their eyes open and -- and pay more attention to -- to what’s going on around them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">Q: But personally, don’t you think they would be affected, knowing what their mother went through as a child, now that they all have children, correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">Q: Don’t you think beyond the universal --</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">Q: -- that they would be very affected personally?</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">A: I -- I -- I hope, I hope that they are not, because it’s definitely very difficult to bring up children, with -- with a frightening feeling, and that’s -- was my feeling.</span> <span id="s1605">While bringing up my children, it’s like I was always afraid, God forbid, it can happen again, it can happen again, something can happen.</span> <span id="s1606">And it’s -- it’s not a healthy situation, that -- that is not.</span> <span id="s1607">It’s very frightening.</span> <span id="s1608">Not that I don’t think about it now.</span> <span id="s1609">I -- I never stop thinking, I always think about it, and it’s always in back of my mind, and now that I have grandchildren, God bless them, all I keep praying is, “Please God, let it never happen again.”</span> <span id="s1610">Oh, anyplace, unfortunately.</span> <span id="s1611">But it’s -- You see, what’s happening now in -- in -- in -- in Serbia, right?</span> <span id="s1612">In Croatia, or whatever.</span> <span id="s1613">It’s horrible.</span> <span id="s1614">It should never happen.</span> <span id="s1615">But it’s nothing compared to Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1616">See, when people say, because there’s mass murder over there, it’s a Holocaust, no.</span> <span id="s1617">It is completely different.</span> <span id="s1618">The Holocaust -- The Hitler times were completely different from any times in history.</span> <span id="s1619">And what he did to a nation, the Jewish nation, is beyond explanation, beyond comprehension, beyond understanding.</span> <span id="s1620">A-A-A-And where in the world can a human being, so-called, even come with such ideas, to systematically finish off six million people, besides five million of other kind of people, right?</span> <span id="s1621">Different nationalities.</span> <span id="s1622">So -- And the world let him do it.</span> <span id="s1623">Everyone just sat back and, well it’s not our business, right?</span> <span id="s1624">We are in America, so whatever’s happening in Europe, yeah, it’s their -- their problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">Q: I wanted to kind of draw into a return to your personal life and your feeling about children, because I know that you’re thinking about doing a book.</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">A: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">Q: And I’d like to ask you about that.</span> <span id="s1628">Why do you think you have such a need to do a book?</span> <span id="s1629">A: Well, simply because I think that children will be able to learn an awful lot from my experience.</span> <span id="s1630">Since I was such a little girl and I had a -- I think it was quite an imagination, to be able to survive, alone, without a mother, without any family, thinking and always being a step ahead of my enemy.</span> <span id="s1631">That, I think, would give the children who will get to read the book, you know, the strength, perhaps intelligence too, that hopefully they are never in trouble, but if they are, they can think that they can do certain things to survive, and not panic and think, well, you know, there’s nothing they can do.</span> <span id="s1632">Yes, they can do, because if they learn, a -- they can remember.</span> <span id="s1633">And by remembering, you -- you know, you react differently.</span> <span id="s1634">Like when you don’t know anything, you don’t know.</span> <span id="s1635">Today I look at -- at children five years old, or five and a half, or six, and I say to myself, “Oh my God, at their age, I already was hiding.”</span> <span id="s1636">I knew that no one is supposed to know that I am a Jew.</span> <span id="s1637">Yet, I knew, that in order to fool others, they should think that I’m not Jewish, I wore a big cross, okay?</span> <span id="s1638">I had to hide and I had no place where to sleep, so the lady that throws me out of her house, I sleep under her house.</span> <span id="s1639">And she doesn’t even know.</span> <span id="s1640">See how I was thinking to survive, ha -- what to do.</span> <span id="s1641">That she’s not supposed to know, because if she would know, she would -- certainly wouldn’t let me sleep under her house, because she was afraid.</span> <span id="s1642">But yet -- But yet, I did it, cause I wanted to live, and I wanted to survive.</span> <span id="s1643">I also knew that -- you know, that I should never walk on the same street twice.</span> <span id="s1644">People should not suspect that maybe I’m a Jew.</span> <span id="s1645">And a Jew is being killed, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">Q: This is a little beyond the point, but I -- I still wonder, even after our first interview, how you ate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">A: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1648">Q: How you fed yourself, and how you kept your clothes to look something less than a bum.</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">A: Well, you know, the clothes that I have -- that I was wearing, wasn’t even mine, because I don’t know if I told you or I told the museum, is this was when we were taken to be killed.</span> <span id="s1650">And so we were completely undressed, except for the panties -- underwear.</span> <span id="s1651">But, when we got to the slaughterhouse, where they did the killing, the mass killing, a-and my mother spoke to this SS person, asking him if they kill Ukrainians, too.</span> <span id="s1652">And she gave him the whole story, that she was on her way with her two girls, to this town, which -- which was not too far from where the killing wa -- was going on, to see her husband, who was in jail.</span> <span id="s1653">And he believed her, and then he put us inside the slaughterhouse, we should wait until he brings in a translator, a Ukrainian translator.</span> <span id="s1654">And then, after he told the translator to take us back to the city, we needed clothing, we were naked.</span> <span id="s1655">So, he took my sister, told my sister to go outside, and they had mountains, hills of clothing, from everybody else.</span> <span id="s1656">And so she picked whatever she thought would fit me, herself and my mother.</span> <span id="s1657">And so, this is what I was wearing, which was a pair of boots, short boots.</span> <span id="s1658">And I had knee highs, a little sir -- short skirt, a sweater and a little jacket and a scarf.</span> <span id="s1659">This was my clothing.</span> <span id="s1660">And I remained with this clothing until the end of the war, which was from ’41, that’s right, okay? ’</span> <span id="s1661">41, so when we were -- the second time in the ghetto, of course my mother washed it, you know, and cleaned it, okay?</span> <span id="s1662">But, after I was on my own, the six months, I never took it off.</span> <span id="s1663">I slept this way, and I wore it during the day, cause I had nothing else to wear.</span> <span id="s1664">You have -- I had no place to take a shower or a bath.</span> <span id="s1665">So that’s how it was.</span> <span id="s1666">Unfortunately, if you remember I told you, that although I stayed with the lady for two weeks, I was infested with lice.</span> <span id="s1667">And that is because the only time that I got a bath is when my mother brought me in two weeks before.</span> <span id="s1668">So that day, sh -- that evening, she gave me a bath.</span> <span id="s1669">But then, the other two weeks that I stayed with her, she didn’t give me a bath.</span> <span id="s1670">So, I became infested with lice.</span> <span id="s1671">And so, when she ask me to leave her house, I walked out, and I went to our friend’s, which we used to visit every so often.</span> <span id="s1672">We bought our house from them, and I remembered where my mother u -- my mother, my father, when we used to go visiting them, and I would walk the same way, they were on the other end of the city, I -- you know, I don’t remember exactly how long it took me to walk.</span> <span id="s1673">But I walked, and I -- you know, I -- I went to her and she realized that I was s -- I was infested.</span> <span id="s1674">So, in the winter -- it was already in the winter was very, very cold, she took me into her barn, undressed me, took my clothes and hung it outside, so everything can sort of freeze.</span> <span id="s1675">And she shaved my head, and -- and she gave me a bath and she put cream over my head, because I had, you know, rashes.</span> <span id="s1676">I had blood, abs -- just blood already, dripping down my -- my head, because it was so itchy.</span> <span id="s1677">And I stayed with her for a week, and then she said I have to go.</span> <span id="s1678">So, how did I survive?</span> <span id="s1679">Well, I used to go every so often to our neighbors, Gentile neighbors, cause there were no Jews already, in the city.</span> <span id="s1680">So I would go to them, and they would give me bread, maybe potato soup, a glass of milk.</span> <span id="s1681">Sometimes they’ll give me fruits.</span> <span id="s1682">Now, this kept me going.</span> <span id="s1683">So, I didn’t go every day to them, you know, I couldn’t be seen going to the same place all the time, because then they’ll be always someone who will detect, and feel, you know, that this must be a Jewish kid.</span> <span id="s1684">So I -- I -- this was always in my mind, I have to be very, very careful, and I was.</span> <span id="s1685">So whatever they gave me, I made sure that I just save enough to have until I go again next week, or you know, or two weeks later.</span> <span id="s1686">So, that’s how I a -- and I -- I -- I always tried to go to different neighbors, and one shouldn’t know if, you know, that I went to this one or that one.</span> <span id="s1687">That’s how I survived.</span> <span id="s1688">Oh God.</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">Q: You mean, you were that young, and they -- they didn’t wonder where -- where you stayed?</span> <span id="s1690">They didn’t ever ask?</span></p> <p><span id="s1691">A: Never asked, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">Q: Do you think they knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s1693">A: Well, they knew that I am somewheres, right, but you see, they just, I imagine, didn’t ask, because there was nothing they could do about it.</span> <span id="s1694">They would not ask me to stay with them, because they were also afraid.</span> <span id="s1695">So, if I came and I just -- could you give me -- you know, could you give me something to eat, do you have something?</span> <span id="s1696">In fact, if I remember correctly, I don’t remember even walking in into the house, but rather, staying outside in the back and they would bring something out to me.</span> <span id="s1697">Do you understand?</span> <span id="s1698">So, i-i-it was -- I -- I -- I think it was quite frightening for them, you know, worrisome for them to -- to deal with something like this, because you know, they could not completely ignore me, and they could not completely reject that I -- if I’m asking for food, so they gave me the food, which was -- that was very nice.</span> <span id="s1699">If not for them, where would I be going to eat?</span> <span id="s1700">I couldn’t go to strangers.</span> <span id="s1701">But if you -- I don’t know if I mentioned that last time, one day, it’s been awhile and I had no food, and here I’m walking, you know, on one of the avenues, and there’s a restaurant and it has a very big window, a glass window, and people are sitting and eating and I’m so hungry.</span> <span id="s1702">I -- I imagine -- I -- I -- it must have been I didn’t have enough food, really, left.</span> <span id="s1703">So I’m standing at that window and I’m -- I’m looking in and I see there’s people sitting, there’s one seat available, by the counter.</span> <span id="s1704">So, I walked in, and I just went over and I sat down.</span> <span id="s1705">And I’m sitting down next to a gentleman, a -- I don’t know him.</span> <span id="s1706">A-And the young lady, the waitress, came over and asked me what I wanted.</span> <span id="s1707">Well, you know, I always remember that I’m not supposed to eat things that are not kosher.</span> <span id="s1708">So, I asked her for potato soup.</span> <span id="s1709">So, potato soup has nothing, it’s just water and potatoes, and carrots maybe, maybe.</span> <span id="s1710">And so, she was -- she thought that I was together with this man.</span> <span id="s1711">So, of course, she served me, she brought me th-the -- the potato soup, and I finished eating it, and she came over and she said, “You -- You’re paying?</span> <span id="s1712">Are you paying?”</span> <span id="s1713">And I said, “I don’t have any money.”</span> <span id="s1714">Which I didn’t, because the hundred rubles that my mother left me, I -- I bought myself a cross, so I can fool everyone.</span> <span id="s1715">So -- And I started crying.</span> <span id="s1716">So, the gentleman just took the bill from her, and he said nothing.</span> <span id="s1717">I think he may -- maybe he realized that, you know, or maybe he just thought I was an orphan, or maybe he just thought -- well, he couldn’t even know -- he -- he couldn’t really know that I was Jewish, because I had that big cross, and I made sure that everybody sees it, okay?</span> <span id="s1718">And then, I don’t look Jewish either.</span> <span id="s1719">So, he must have thought, you know, this kid is just an orphan from somewheres, whatever, and -- and he just said, “It’s okay, it’s okay,” and I was crying, and I just walked out crying.</span> <span id="s1720">But at least I had the soup, and I had the potato -- I mean, the potato soup, which was -- I don’t know how long it lasted me, but that’s how I managed.</span> <span id="s1721">But, you see, so children can learn.</span></p> <p><span id="s1722">Q: You were six?</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">Q: I know today, that if we saw someone who was six or seven walking alone, we would go about them.</span> <span id="s1725">I’m wondering, were there lots of other orphans around?</span> <span id="s1726">Were -- Were you the only one, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1727">A: Well, I -- I saw myself only walking around.</span> <span id="s1728">I didn’t see other kids.</span> <span id="s1729">I mean, you know, maybe they were on different streets, but as -- again, as I told you before, at that time, the city didn’t have already, any Jews, because they had already a second pogrom.</span> <span id="s1730">That means they finished off the rest of the Jews that they did not kill in ’41.</span> <span id="s1731">See, we had -- There was a pogrom in for -- in ’41, and then in ’42, a second one.</span> <span id="s1732">So, at that time already, maybe there was, you know, hiding here and there, but I haven’t seen anyone, so -- that I know or -- or suspect, or anything like that.</span> <span id="s1733">I mean, I wasn’t in touch with anyone.</span> <span id="s1734">I just live in my own world.</span></p> <p><span id="s1735">Q: I -- I want to go to the present world for a minute, because before we started, you mentioned a movie that you had seen recently.</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1737">Q: I’d love to hear what you thought, and tell me what movie it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1738">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1739">Well, the movie was “Life is Beautiful.”</span> <span id="s1740">You know, it’s -- it’s amazing the way that Mr. what’s his name, th-the actor and director [indecipherable] put it together.</span> <span id="s1741">He truly was a comedian.</span> <span id="s1742">I mean, it’s -- yeah, you know, if you take a -- every survivor will have a different story, because there were so many happenings.</span> <span id="s1743">Now, what he did, was -- was truly a -- an exceptional thing, to hide a child in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1744">Now, it is -- if it’s true, it’s truly an amazing thing, that he was able to pull it off, sort of, you know?</span> <span id="s1745">I did most of the time, I cried, yeah, mostly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1746">Q: Did you identify with the man or the boy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1747">A: The boy, you know, the boy.</span> <span id="s1748">It’s, you know, hiding him, but -- except you see, the difference between the boy and myself is that I was alone.</span> <span id="s1749">See, he had his father, he had that security, that protection from his father.</span> <span id="s1750">Although he knew that there is -- that there were dangerous times and he’s in a dangerous place, but yet he had his father there.</span> <span id="s1751">I had no one.</span> <span id="s1752">I was alone.</span> <span id="s1753">And I had to think of how to save myself, of how to survive.</span> <span id="s1754">And I think that -- that’s it’s something.</span> <span id="s1755">When I think about it now, I-I just don’t understand how I did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1756">Q: In -- Any particular scenes in the movie that really touched you the most?</span></p> <p><span id="s1757">A: You know, the idea is that he’s in concentration camp, and at any minute, somebody might, you know, there’s the -- he’s hiding, and they might kill him.</span> <span id="s1758">You know, you always want everyone to survive.</span> <span id="s1759">I wouldn’t want to see anyone killed.</span> <span id="s1760">I’ve seen already enough horror, so even the movie, to me it’s like I was sitting and saying, “Oh, I hope he survives, I hope.”</span> <span id="s1761">I didn’t know what was coming, but I was hoping, of course, that he survives, and -- which he did, and I was very happy at that, and at the end he meets the -- you know, he finds his mother, and that’s -- that was really very nice.</span> <span id="s1762">That’s something like my -- my happening, you know?</span> <span id="s1763">When I saw my mother, that was very nice.</span> <span id="s1764">And my question was, “Why did you leave me?”</span> <span id="s1765">Y-You know, during that time, I never cried.</span> <span id="s1766">Can imagine?</span> <span id="s1767">I was alone for six months, and I never cried?</span> <span id="s1768">And then when I -- when I saw my mother, a -- End of Tape Four, Side A Beginning Tape Four, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1769">Q: This is a continuation of tape one, side B, Frima Laub.</span></p> <p><span id="s1770">A: And so, you know, all this time, I knew I’m not supposed to cry, I’m not supposed to complain, I’m not supposed to do all these things.</span> <span id="s1771">And so, when I finally, you know, got together with my mother, and she sees me wearing the cross, she says, “My child, what is this?”</span> <span id="s1772">And I says, “I wanted to live.”</span> <span id="s1773">And then -- No, she took it off and she gave it to the priest of the town.</span> <span id="s1774">And then I said to her, I’m look at her, I says, “Mama, why did you leave me?”</span> <span id="s1775">Well, she explained to me -- I da -- well, when she left me with the lady, she said to me, “I got to go,” she said, “but I can’t take you right now, because it’s very cold.”</span> <span id="s1776">And -- And I -- I understood, except I certainly didn’t want my mother to leave me.</span> <span id="s1777">So my excuse was, I says, “Mom, I have a headache.”</span> <span id="s1778">And she said, “The lady will give you an aspirin, you’ll feel better.”</span> <span id="s1779">And she said, “But -- But in springtime,” she said, “I’ll send someone to pick you up and bring you to me, where I’m going to be.”</span> <span id="s1780">And that was that, and she walked out.</span> <span id="s1781">She gave me a kiss and she walked out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1782">Q: Do you feel like she made a mistake?</span></p> <p><span id="s1783">A: No.</span> <span id="s1784">Mm-mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">Q: If it had been your child --</span></p> <p><span id="s1786">A: Oh, please.</span></p> <p><span id="s1787">Q: -- would you have done that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1788">A: No, probably not.</span> <span id="s1789">But then, those were different times, and as you can see, six years -- at the age of six years then, is nothing compared today.</span> <span id="s1790">Not even a 16 year old.</span> <span id="s1791">I’m looking at our beautiful generation of young Americans.</span> <span id="s1792">They -- They -- They wouldn’t even know how -- what to do.</span> <span id="s1793">This is why that book is very important, because they are -- it’s -- it’s -- it’s a real happening to a six year old girl.</span> <span id="s1794">When I think about it now, I say I must have been 60 then.</span> <span id="s1795">To think the way I thought, to plan the way I planned.</span> <span id="s1796">I-I-I mean, remember I told you, one evening -- I used to come back very late, cause I wanted to make sure that everyone is asleep in the lady’s house, and ev -- in the neighborhood, so nobody sees me crawling into -- you know, to the doghouse.</span> <span id="s1797">And one evening, the wom -- and I all -- it was never earlier than -- than 12 - one o’clock in the morning, cause I wanted to make sure that everybody is asleep.</span> <span id="s1798">And when I got there, I saw how the lights were on in her house, so, I wouldn’t dare climbing into -- to the doghouse under her house.</span> <span id="s1799">So, the house next to her was bombed out from -- from shells, and I decided to sleep then -- there.</span> <span id="s1800">Now, what happened is, it was completely bombed out, but there were four half walls, okay?</span> <span id="s1801">Rubbles inside.</span> <span id="s1802">I crawl we -- went in there, I lied down.</span> <span id="s1803">I just, you know, sort of he-held onto myself, and in order to stay warm, I blew the -- my -- my -- my -- my breathing.</span> <span id="s1804">I -- I blew in my air into the sweater that I was wearing, so I can stay warm through the night, cause that was winter.</span> <span id="s1805">And the winters in Europe are brutal.</span> <span id="s1806">And -- And that’s how I -- you know, of course I didn’t sleep through the night, that’s a different story, but that’s how I kept myself warm.</span> <span id="s1807">I had no blankets, I had nothing.</span> <span id="s1808">I was just lying on the rubbles.</span></p> <p><span id="s1809">Q: Where would you be during that late supper night?</span> <span id="s1810">I mean, between six and midnight, where would you see --</span></p> <p><span id="s1811">A: Walking the streets.</span> <span id="s1812">I never stopped walking the streets.</span> <span id="s1813">Remember, I used to start at dawn, when it started -- when it became a little bit light, I would crawl out from under the house, shake off the -- the hay that -- that the dog was sleeping on, and so I was sleeping with the dog, remember?</span> <span id="s1814">And I would shake everything off, and put on my scarf, and I -- I did my praying and I put on the cross, and I walked out nobody should see me, and I started walking the streets.</span> <span id="s1815">That’s how I used to do, until 12 - one o’clock in the morning, when everybody was asleep in the area.</span> <span id="s1816">I wanted to make sure nobody sees me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1817">Q: Do you think that, as I see you now, as a very spirited person, do you think that that experience gave you patience, perseverance, daring, planning, any of the above?</span></p> <p><span id="s1818">A: Well, you know what really gave me strength?</span> <span id="s1819">And that is I always felt there’s someone watching over me.</span> <span id="s1820">I mean, that God is watching over me.</span> <span id="s1821">And I felt that -- that I’ll be okay.</span> <span id="s1822">I-I sort of never felt alone.</span> <span id="s1823">I felt there’s someone watching over me and I’ll be okay.</span> <span id="s1824">And so, by praying, that’s how I felt.</span> <span id="s1825">I pray, somebody listens to me and will take care of me.</span> <span id="s1826">And -- And this is how I just kept going.</span> <span id="s1827">And I felt very -- I felt stro -- I felt -- I never thought, you know, that I’ll get killed, because I already escaped two killings, so I didn’t think that it can happen to me again.</span> <span id="s1828">But whether -- I just have to make sure that I’m not caught, and that the six months or seven months -- it’s six months, actually, will go by, and soon there’ll be spring, and sa -- my mother said she’ll send someone to pick me up, and that’s how I felt it will be.</span> <span id="s1829">So, it’s very good thinking.</span></p> <p><span id="s1830">Q: Very good thinking, and a lot of faith.</span></p> <p><span id="s1831">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1832">Q: And that’s a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1833">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1834">Q: -- another thing I wanted to ask you, I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1835">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1836">Q: -- I think I -- we -- we discussed your being a -- a religious Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1837">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1838">Q: And the role of prayer in helping you to survive the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1839">Well, what about the years after the Holocaust?</span> <span id="s1840">Do you still pray every day?</span> <span id="s1841">Do you pray for different things now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1842">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1843">Not only do I pray for different things, but every Friday night, when I kindle the lights, I will stand by them and I will talk to God.</span> <span id="s1844">I pray for peace on earth, I pray for peace in Israel.</span> <span id="s1845">I pray for -- for health, and I pray for happiness, and I pray for so many things.</span> <span id="s1846">I just stand there and I pray.</span> <span id="s1847">But most of all, I do -- I really very much concentrate on everything that I pray and I’m asking God please this and this and this and that, is for peace, God, for peace.</span> <span id="s1848">And I hope we’ll have peace.</span> <span id="s1849">But right now, there’s so many things going on in the world, where’s the peace?</span> <span id="s1850">I don’t have peace.</span> <span id="s1851">I never live in peace.</span></p> <p><span id="s1852">Q: What part of the world disturbs you right now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1853">A: The whole world.</span> <span id="s1854">It doe --</span></p> <p><span id="s1855">Q: What struggle, specifically?</span></p> <p><span id="s1856">A: I mean, wherever I hear killings, it bothers me.</span> <span id="s1857">It just -- It just it -- it’s eating me that 50 years later, the world still didn’t learn anything?</span> <span id="s1858">Why -- Why are these things happening?</span> <span id="s1859">I-I mean, there’s no reason for it.</span> <span id="s1860">But yet, the pe-people are doing it, and the rest of the world doesn’t seem to do much about it.</span> <span id="s1861">So, it doesn’t matter if it’s in Uganda, that there is killing, in India there is killing and in -- in Croatia they are killing.</span> <span id="s1862">I just -- These killings just bother me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1863">Q: That brings up something that the museum is very interested in -- in knowing about and I think last time, I remember, you gave so much of your young experience in the interview, that by the time we got to the more post-war experience, y-you were very tired, and so I want to revisit some of those questions that I meant to ask you then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1864">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1865">Q: And one of the things which I remember upset you very much, was when I ask you your response to Japanese concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1866">Now, I’m not trying to compare these things to the Holocaust, I’m trying to get your response, and there’s a list here, which I’ll just let you look, of events that happened in the United States, here, and if you want to just choose the ones that you remember especially, and how they affected you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1867">A: Well, if we’ll go to the Japanese concentration camps, are you talking the ones that we had in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1868">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1869">A: During the war?</span> <span id="s1870">Remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1871">Q: I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1872">A: Was it during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1873">Q: I thought it was after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1874">A: We were -- you know, was after -- well, after the war, no it -- it couldn’t have been.</span> <span id="s1875">We’re talking concentration camps in the United States.</span> <span id="s1876">Was that the time that the United States was at war with Japan?</span> <span id="s1877">Are these the concentration camps we are talking about, or are we talking about --</span></p> <p><span id="s1878">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1879">In the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1880">A: In the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1881">Q: These are -- These are Japanese-Americans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1882">A: Okay, right, but -- but in those days, and I think today it probably would be the same, there are people who are so devoted to their original question, that although they are in the United States, they might, in some way, you know, react in a terrorist way.</span> <span id="s1883">So, in those days, these camps, I think the government did the right thing, okay?</span> <span id="s1884">Now, these concentration camps, you cannot compare to Hitler’s concentration camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1885">Q: No, we’re not doing that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1886">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1887">Q: I -- I’m just trying to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1888">A: This was strictly --</span></p> <p><span id="s1889">Q: -- trying to see how your experience --</span></p> <p><span id="s1890">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1891">Q: -- affected you around other big, political issues.</span></p> <p><span id="s1892">A: Okay, this was a political issue.</span></p> <p><span id="s1893">Q: Because not everyone felt that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1894">A: Okay, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1895">Q: A lot of people felt that they were being imprisoned, just because of their race.</span></p> <p><span id="s1896">A: No.</span> <span id="s1897">They were imprisoned because United States was at war with that country, who attacked the United States.</span> <span id="s1898">Therefore, they were careful to make sure that they don’t get -- of course, they don’t know who is a terrorist, who isn’t and who has in mind to harm the United States.</span> <span id="s1899">So they wanted to make sure.</span> <span id="s1900">And they just -- what they did is, they didn’t -- it’s not a concentration camp the way Europe had, but rather an area where they kept all the people that they might, you know, th-that they suspected maybe will do something harmful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1901">Q: Did you -- sorry, did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1902">A: Yeah, go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1903">Q: -- let’s just emphasize the events --</span></p> <p><span id="s1904">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1905">Q: -- when you were already in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1906">A: United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1907">Q: You came in 1957?</span></p> <p><span id="s1908">A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1909">Q: So, do you remember anything about the Civil Rights movement going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1910">A: Yes, I -- I think it was -- it was a good movement.</span> <span id="s1911">I think that we came a long way.</span> <span id="s1912">I think it was the right thing.</span> <span id="s1913">Unfortunately, you know, the minorities had to go through a lot.</span> <span id="s1914">But, they came a long way, and I think this movement was good.</span> <span id="s1915">The Vietnam war, unfortunately, I think was a disaster.</span> <span id="s1916">And that did bother me a lot.</span> <span id="s1917">It bothered me because the truth of the matter is, we had no business to be there, especially losing so many of our young people.</span> <span id="s1918">S -- Also, the fact that France was there before, and they left it, why did we take it over?</span> <span id="s1919">It’s none of our business, okay?</span> <span id="s1920">And -- And -- And the truth of the matter is, to send our boys is, if we would have been -- if that country would have attacked us, that’s a different story.</span> <span id="s1921">But here, that was a waste.</span> <span id="s1922">And let’s see, which other one of we have here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1923">Q: Kent State.</span></p> <p><span id="s1924">A: The Kent State.</span> <span id="s1925">Well, that was because of the Vietnam war, right?</span> <span id="s1926">Because these kids didn’t want to stand for it, and I don’t blame them.</span> <span id="s1927">That -- That war bothered me a lot.</span> <span id="s1928">It still does to this day, when I go and I see that wall.</span> <span id="s1929">That is, to me --</span></p> <p><span id="s1930">Q: Which wall are you discussing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1931">A: Where they have the Vietnam -- the names of the Vietnam boys.</span></p> <p><span id="s1932">Q: What upset you about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1933">A: Well, the fact that they lost their life, and -- and i-it’s not protecting their country.</span> <span id="s1934">It wasn’t a war that we were, you know, like -- like -- like the Japanese.</span> <span id="s1935">The Japanese attacked us, so we had to retaliate, okay?</span> <span id="s1936">We had to defend ourselves.</span> <span id="s1937">But the Vietnam war had nothing to do with us, really.</span> <span id="s1938">So, that was an unfortunate move from the government, God bless them anyway.</span> <span id="s1939">Okay, the Feminist movement, it’s okay.</span> <span id="s1940">The assassination of all these big people, yes, bothered me very much.</span> <span id="s1941">John F. Kennedy, Evers, Martin Luther King, Robert Kennedy.</span> <span id="s1942">That was very unfortunate, and that was something that I feel maybe it could have been prevented.</span> <span id="s1943">I am not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1944">Q: Which thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1945">A: Robert Kennedy.</span> <span id="s1946">He was killed by -- by someone from the Middle East.</span> <span id="s1947">And I -- I -- I think that what is happening that we feel that we have so much freedom in this country, and it’s democracy, we don’t have to worry about terrorists, or killings, but we do.</span> <span id="s1948">We have a lot of assassins running around this country, and all -- they have freedom also.</span> <span id="s1949">So, unfortunately, we lost some very good people, some beautiful people, and I’m sorry about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1950">Q: Who was president when you first came?</span></p> <p><span id="s1951">A: It was Eisenhower, you’re right.</span> <span id="s1952">Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1953">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1954">Q: Do you remember anything distinctly different -- of course it was different from Cuba, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1955">A: Well, you have to realize that I came from Cuba, and in Cuba we had at that time, a -- a dictator, okay?</span> <span id="s1956">And -- And I really didn’t know much about politics.</span> <span id="s1957">All I knew is, you know, that -- that, you know, that I have to work and I have to get an education and that’s that.</span> <span id="s1958">That takes care on that.</span> <span id="s1959">I -- I really didn’t know much about politics.</span> <span id="s1960">And life was very nice and very peaceful in Cuba.</span> <span id="s1961">So I -- I really don’t know much, as to, you know, wh-what -- what he did right, or what he did wrong.</span> <span id="s1962">Reagan’s visit to the gravesites of German soldiers, that disturbed me, yes, that disturbed me very much.</span> <span id="s1963">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s1964">Q: Tell me about that, a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1965">A: Well, first of all, to give such an honor, that an American president should go to the German soldiers who were at war, not only, you know with Russia and Poland and the Ukraine and the other countries, but they were really also at war, sort of, with the United States, and to give them the honor of having an American president, that -- that -- that didn’t makes much sense to me.</span> <span id="s1966">I [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1967">Q: Did -- Did you discuss with other Jewish people how they felt about that, at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1968">A: They all felt the same way.</span> <span id="s1969">Even not -- E-Even -- Even not the survivors, I mean just American, you know, Jewish American people.</span> <span id="s1970">They -- They were all definitely against it.</span> <span id="s1971">They said that they -- those soldiers do not deserve the respect of the American president.</span> <span id="s1972">But then, you know, President Roosevelt wasn’t exactly perfect for -- for the people -- for the Jews during World War Two, either.</span> <span id="s1973">He was a great president for this wonderful country, but he didn’t do much for us, remember?</span> <span id="s1974">I mean, not even when he was told what was going on, and he was asked to bomb the concentration camps, or the -- the trains going to the concentration camps, and he said, [inaudible] that’s what he said, they hadn -- didn’t have enough bombs or they can’t do it.</span> <span id="s1975">I -- I mean, I don’t remember exactly, but i-i-it was some kind of ridiculous excuse.</span> <span id="s1976">It just -- thoughtlessness I guess.</span> <span id="s1977">Poor politics, and perhaps not a great feeling for hum-humanity, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1978">Q: Well, that’s why I was asking you, when your relatives, your aunts, who love you very much personally, didn’t want you to talk about it, I’m wondering if this attitude existed even on the part of the government.</span> <span id="s1979">They know what’s happening, but at the same time, they’re not there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1980">A: A very good possibility, but I don’t really know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1981">Q: There was a lot of denial going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1982">A: Oh, oh, yes.</span> <span id="s1983">I’m sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1984">Q: I’m even told by American Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1985">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1986">Yeah, yes, it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1987">Q: Have you ever heard anybody talk about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1988">A: No, not -- not -- not really.</span> <span id="s1989">You know, like -- I mean, we all felt that President Roosevelt did not do much for -- you know, for the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1990">He didn’t do much, he sort of ignored it.</span> <span id="s1991">And well, today I guess they are a little bit different, right?</span> <span id="s1992">They are trying to prevent killings in different countries today.</span> <span id="s1993">I don’t know if they’ll be successful or not, but with us, they didn’t even let that ship of 900 Jewish -- German Jews, le -- they -- they wouldn’t let into this country.</span> <span id="s1994">And then, of course, everybody else closed their doors to that ship and they had to turn that ship back to -- to Germany.</span> <span id="s1995">Now, hey, today, look at it.</span> <span id="s1996">Today we’ll let everyone in, including prisoners from Cuba, including terrorists.</span> <span id="s1997">Everybody is welcome.</span> <span id="s1998">We don’t check them.</span> <span id="s1999">With AIDS, without AIDS, whatever.</span> <span id="s2000">So, now maybe, perhaps we’re doing already, too much now, and in those days we did very little, or hardly anything.</span> <span id="s2001">So, for tha -- for the survivors it is painful, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2002">Q: What kind of --</span></p> <p><span id="s2003">A: I -- I feel that the world really ignored me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2004">Q: What kind of job do you think that Clinton is doing right now?</span> <span id="s2005">Is he too liberal?</span></p> <p><span id="s2006">A: Regarding?</span></p> <p><span id="s2007">Q: Is he too liberal?</span> <span id="s2008">Well, I guess we were discussing immigrants.</span></p> <p><span id="s2009">A: Well, to a certain extent, I think he might be a little bit liberal.</span> <span id="s2010">I -- I feel that this country deserves to have, you know, nice people, good people, responsible people.</span> <span id="s2011">Not just anybody should come into a country like this.</span> <span id="s2012">And that’s exactly what we are doing.</span> <span id="s2013">Look what’s going on.</span> <span id="s2014">We have terrorists, we have the neo-Nazis, who have the freedom of organizing themselves, training themselves, right here in the United States.</span> <span id="s2015">Now, does it make sense?</span> <span id="s2016">Do you know, as a survivor, how I feel?</span> <span id="s2017">That’s why I always am afraid while bringing up my children, it’s always behind my ba -- in back of my head.</span></p> <p><span id="s2018">Q: What -- What did you think then, bringing up the subject of neo-Nazis, about Littleton, Colorado?</span></p> <p><span id="s2019">A: Well, well --</span></p> <p><span id="s2020">Q: Happening on Hitler’s birthday.</span> <span id="s2021">What -- What did you think when you first saw that [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2022">A: You know what ca -- what the first thing y-you start thinking is?</span> <span id="s2023">That we’re ignoring them.</span> <span id="s2024">We are giving them the freedom and later on might be too late, we’ll pay a price.</span></p> <p><span id="s2025">Q: Ignoring who?</span></p> <p><span id="s2026">A: The group.</span> <span id="s2027">The neo-Nazis.</span> <span id="s2028">.</span> <span id="s2029">And this, after 50 years, or sic -- 55 years, that they still admire a butcher like Hitler.</span> <span id="s2030">Do you understand?</span> <span id="s2031">And that is not from the children alone.</span> <span id="s2032">These children, or these young people, they hear about it in their homes, from their parents, okay?</span> <span id="s2033">So, obviously, there are still followers.</span> <span id="s2034">There are still those that feel that the people in this world are not good enough for them.</span> <span id="s2035">And what do you think wa -- why are they training?</span></p> <p><span id="s2036">Q: What do you mean, training?</span></p> <p><span id="s2037">A: Well, they’re training how to kill.</span> <span id="s2038">They have arms, okay?</span> <span id="s2039">So, what do you think they are going to do with those arms?</span> <span id="s2040">Let’s see in 15 years, 20 -- 15 - 20 years from now, or maybe even earlier.</span> <span id="s2041">What do you think they’re going to do?</span> <span id="s2042">It’s not a hobby.</span> <span id="s2043">They have a purpose.</span> <span id="s2044">It’s just we are not paying that much attention to them, cause we are giving them freedom.</span> <span id="s2045">And sometimes too much freedom for criminals, you know what happens.</span> <span id="s2046">We pay, later on, a price.</span> <span id="s2047">Now, the bombing of -- of -- of the Twin Towers, there’s an example.</span> <span id="s2048">We’re letting in terrorists to this country.</span> <span id="s2049">We’re giving them freedom, we’re giving them ho -- a home, we giving them everything, and look what we get in return.</span></p> <p><span id="s2050">Q: But I -- It’s kind of hard to judge who -- who is and who is not.</span></p> <p><span id="s2051">A: For what?</span></p> <p><span id="s2052">Q: A terrorist.</span> <span id="s2053">Y-Y-You don’t know until it happens.</span></p> <p><span id="s2054">A: That i -- That -- That is correct, but no, no, no, no, the United States, I’m sure, has enough of intelligence to know -- the ones that are terrorists, did things before, maybe in a different country, not exactly in the United States.</span> <span id="s2055">So, we are not really checking out the people that are coming into this country, unfortunately, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s2056">Q: What about the kids?</span> <span id="s2057">What about the people who live here, th -- they -- they are citizens --</span></p> <p><span id="s2058">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2059">Q: -- there are a lot of citizens, I understand --</span></p> <p><span id="s2060">A: Mm-hm, mm-hm --</span></p> <p><span id="s2061">Q: -- who are --</span></p> <p><span id="s2062">A: -- right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2063">Q: -- arming themselves and what -- what could the government do about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2064">A: What could the government do about that?</span> <span id="s2065">Well, first of all, I think we have -- there’s too much freedom in getting arms in this country.</span> <span id="s2066">If you have the money, you can get it, and that’s number one, so right away, they should stop this, okay?</span> <span id="s2067">And number two, even the citizens here, the ones that go out to get arms, the government should know what for and -- and give them a certain -- even -- and they have to be checked up.</span> <span id="s2068">I think that those people that apply for arms should be checked out first, and then given a certain period of -- and then, you know, you have to keep an eye on certain people also.</span> <span id="s2069">It’s -- I-It’s not easy, but we don’t seem to be doing anything about it.</span> <span id="s2070">It’s really -- there are -- the arms here are free for all.</span> <span id="s2071">Any kid, any youngster, any terrorist, any anybody can just go in and get -- you know, get a gun or get a rifle or whatever.</span> <span id="s2072">And, you know, it should be a little bit stricter.</span> <span id="s2073">It’s true, it’s a democratic country, and it’s, I think to me, it’s the most -- the greatest country in the world, but it’s also frightening for me, even though I live in a democratic, free, beautiful country, why am I always afraid, why am I always worried?</span> <span id="s2074">Because I see what’s going on and it’s -- shouldn’t be that way.</span> <span id="s2075">What can the government do?</span> <span id="s2076">They can do.</span> <span id="s2077">They just see -- sort of ignore it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2078">Q: And I wanted to ask you about Israel as a state.</span> <span id="s2079">You must especially have been aware of this.</span></p> <p><span id="s2080">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s2081">Yeah, I’ve been aware of all these three wars, yeah.</span> <span id="s2082">Well, what about Eichmann?</span> <span id="s2083">Well, there’s a lot of these butchers that got away and were never caught.</span> <span id="s2084">They lied to this country and they came into this country and they lived in this country, some of them.</span> <span id="s2085">Of course, most of them probably died by now.</span> <span id="s2086">But yet, they live a very good life here, after butchering millions of people, okay?</span> <span id="s2087">So that’s because our country is so wonderful, they just let them in and they made up stories, right?</span> <span id="s2088">And we let them in, we never checked out on them, and that was that.</span> <span id="s2089">As far as the wars in Israel, it’s very sad that a little country like this, with a handful of people, especially in those days, had to fight so many armies, from all different fronts, and yet I look at it as a miracle.</span></p> <p><span id="s2090">Q: What -- What’s the miracle?</span></p> <p><span id="s2091">A: The miracle that they always beat the -- their neighbors.</span> <span id="s2092">And they won most of these wars, even though -- even that war in -- in ’73, that Yom Kippur, when they were attacked.</span> <span id="s2093">It turned around and -- but of course, they won the war, but never peace.</span> <span id="s2094">That’s different things and that’s very, very sad.</span> <span id="s2095">As far as today, I feel that nobody should mix in, into their politics and the people of the state of Israel should decide, you know, which president is good for them, prime minister, or what they should do with their neighbors, how to find peace.</span> <span id="s2096">And there’s no one in this world that wants peace more than they do, because there isn’t a family that hasn’t lost a child, a husband, an uncle, a -- a -- a sister, a brother.</span> <span id="s2097">I mean, they are constantly losing people, and really --</span></p> <p><span id="s2098">Q: Are you discussing Jews in Israel?</span> <span id="s2099">A: Huh?</span> <span id="s2100">Yeah, I’m discussing the -- yeah, and I’m discussing that nobody should force them to do anything, because nobody really knows their situation better than they do themselves.</span> <span id="s2101">And as long as they don’t ask for help, then the United States should not mix in.</span> <span id="s2102">They should leave them alone and they -- and they shouldn’t be peace -- a land for peace, they should be peace for peace.</span> <span id="s2103">There’s no such thing as land for peace.</span></p> <p><span id="s2104">Q: As what?</span></p> <p><span id="s2105">A: Land, land.</span> <span id="s2106">Like the president says, “Give them -- Give the Arabs more land, and there’ll be peace.”</span> <span id="s2107">No, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s2108">It has to be peace for peace.</span> <span id="s2109">That means the Arabs have to want peace, so there’s going to be peace.</span> <span id="s2110">You can give them land, no matter how much land you’ll give them.</span> <span id="s2111">But they obviously don’t want peace [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2112">Q: You think they want war?</span></p> <p><span id="s2113">A: No, what I think is they want Israel to move out of the Middle East.</span> <span id="s2114">That’s what I think, because Israel is the only democratic country there.</span> <span id="s2115">Everybody else is the same religion, the same background.</span> <span id="s2116">So they just don’t want Israel there.</span> <span id="s2117">What they don’t fremfa -- what they don’t want to remember is that Israel was there since beginning of time, and they’ll remain there.</span> <span id="s2118">So nobody in this world should mix in and tell the Israeli government what to do, but let them and the people decide what to do.</span> <span id="s2119">And when it comes to peace, nobody wants it more than the Israel -- the Israelis.</span></p> <p><span id="s2120">Q: Let’s go to the next.</span> <span id="s2121">We’re moving on to tape two.</span></p> <p><span id="s2122">End of Tape Four, Side B Beginning Tape Five, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s2123">Q: This is tape two, side A, of a second audio follow up with Frima Laub, conducted by Ginger Miles, on June third, 1999, for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.</span> <span id="s2124">The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making this interview possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s2125">A: We’ll just add to, you know, the Israel’s situation, as far as peace is concerned.</span> <span id="s2126">You see, I feel that the Arab countries, if they would only stop teaching the young children in school about Israel being their enemy and the hatred that they have for the Israelis, or the Jewish people in general, or the state of Israel, I think that there would be peace very quickly, because I imagine and I feel that the young people don’t want wars either.</span> <span id="s2127">But, if they in -- they are taught since they’re very little, that that -- you know, the hostility towards Israel, so how can they grow up wanting peace?</span> <span id="s2128">How can there be peace if they hate their next door neighbor?</span> <span id="s2129">They don’t want to tolerate a next door neighbor.</span> <span id="s2130">So, it -- it bothers me that we are -- that the young generation of the Arab world i-is -- is already growing up with hatred, and -- and -- and -- and hostility against the neighbor.</span> <span id="s2131">And maybe, hopefully, I would like to see someday that they should change their books, and the way they teach those youngsters.</span></p> <p><span id="s2132">Q: Do you think that Jewish kids are being taught --</span></p> <p><span id="s2133">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2134">Q: -- differently?</span></p> <p><span id="s2135">A: Ma -- Yes, absolutely.</span> <span id="s2136">Absolutely.</span> <span id="s2137">See, hatred won’t get you anywheres.</span></p> <p><span id="s2138">Q: I understand that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2139">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2140">Q: But do you th -- you -- are you saying that it’s a one way street, and Israel, that -- th-that Jews --</span></p> <p><span id="s2141">A: Unfortunately, unfortunately, if somebody would like to go to Israel and pick up the books that the children learn from, okay, and a -- how they’re taught about their next door neighbor, and then go to the Arab countries, and look at their textbooks, you will see the difference.</span> <span id="s2142">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s2143">Q: You’ve seen both of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2144">A: I’ve -- People have told me about it, okay?</span> <span id="s2145">So, there is a difference, and -- and this is why I feel very strongly, that as long as the children are taught hatred towards another nation, they ca -- there can never be peace.</span> <span id="s2146">Because, you know, that’s -- they grow up with -- always feeling that their next door neighbor is whatever, you know, and I don’t want to deal with him, and -- so, when the president, you know, when President Clinton thinks that, give them land, you can give them anything you want.</span> <span id="s2147">If they hate you, they will hate you no matter what.</span> <span id="s2148">If they don’t want you there, it doesn’t matter what you give them, unless you give them the whole country, period.</span> <span id="s2149">And that’s something that -- I don’t see peace in the future, unless there’s a change in politics.</span></p> <p><span id="s2150">Q: Do you think that -- Let’s say the book that you wrote about your experience, were distributed in Israel.</span> <span id="s2151">How do you think it would affect children, first of all, Jewish children?</span></p> <p><span id="s2152">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s2153">Q: Do you think they know about the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s2154">A: Well, I think they know, and I certainly hope they do, and they should.</span> <span id="s2155">And I feel that we, in -- in this country, and perhaps all over the world, we waited also a little bit too long, you know, to teach our children, in their schools, about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s2156">I really don’t know why it took them so long.</span> <span id="s2157">Maybe because we were all in denial.</span> <span id="s2158">I mean, it’s possible.</span> <span id="s2159">Like, I -- I didn’t talk to my children, you know, about it.</span> <span id="s2160">Maybe this is what all the parents did, they were all afraid, not to scare their children about it.</span> <span id="s2161">But, I-I think the books are very important, because I think that now, in the 21st century, I think they heard quite a bit about it, and -- and -- and -- and them -- they’re probably going to be a lot of books, and it’s like every survivor has a story, every survivor could write a book, because his experience were different, his horrors that he went through were different.</span> <span id="s2162">And the children can learn from that.</span> <span id="s2163">I mean, they will learn frightening things, but on the other hand they will also learn as to how to -- to survive and -- and -- and how to handle situations and how to try to make this world a better world -- place to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s2164">Q: But there aren’t that many books, I don’t think, about children in the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s2165">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s2166">There must be some, but not really --</span></p> <p><span id="s2167">Q: I wanted to ask you about the children that you have worked with in a mental hospital.</span> <span id="s2168">Is that what you currently do?</span></p> <p><span id="s2169">A: No.</span> <span id="s2170">I work now in a mental health clinic.</span> <span id="s2171">Well, you know, the children that come there have different problems.</span> <span id="s2172">It’s mental health problems and it’s not because of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s2173">It’s unfortunate, because these children don’t have a father, and some of them are in foster homes.</span> <span id="s2174">I-I-It’s very sad.</span> <span id="s2175">And they all -- breaks my heart, really.</span> <span id="s2176">It’s -- It breaks my heart when I see those children, this one’s in a foster home, this one doesn’t have a father, this one is being abused by the father, this one’s being abused by the mother.</span> <span id="s2177">It’s -- It’s -- It’s just very painful and I really wish that somehow in -- in this United States, the minorities, the ones that -- that don’t have fathers, that they would have a family life.</span> <span id="s2178">There’s no family life, and I think this is what affects the children.</span> <span id="s2179">And you see, they are really lost souls.</span> <span id="s2180">They are frightened, they are -- they -- they -- they don’t know what to do, they don’t know how to cope with life.</span> <span id="s2181">So, if they would read my book, I think they would get well, to realize that at this station -- you know, at -- at this age, I was able to do things which they never think of doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2182">Q: Have you ever thought about, before you write the book, going to schools, and talking to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2183">A: I never did.</span> <span id="s2184">And I tell you the reason.</span> <span id="s2185">Because I would probably start crying.</span> <span id="s2186">I still cry.</span> <span id="s2187">I-I mean, it’s just I -- I start talking, I’m reliving situations and -- and -- and I know I just wouldn’t be a very good speaker.</span> <span id="s2188">I would just have to stop in the middle and -- and that’s not exactly what a speaker should do.</span> <span id="s2189">As strong as I was, you know, I’m different, a little bit different now.</span> <span id="s2190">I really live in the past a little bit, or a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s2191">Q: Thinking about when you say you live in the past.</span> <span id="s2192">What’s an example of what you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s2193">A: Well, you see, the past never really left me, or maybe I didn’t leave -- leave the past.</span> <span id="s2194">That means, everything that -- in my daily living, are constantly memories of what happened.</span> <span id="s2195">There isn’t a day that goes by where I don’t -- wat -- see something that reminds me of what happened to me 50 years ago, 55 years ago.</span> <span id="s2196">For example, certain homes look like a barn.</span> <span id="s2197">You know, like they’re very tall and -- and those windows, or whatever.</span> <span id="s2198">Well, if I pass one of those, that reminds me when I was only five and a half and we were hiding in our barn.</span> <span id="s2199">You know, we were hiding from the Germans.</span> <span id="s2200">And then, you know what happened.</span> <span id="s2201">This neighbor of ours would bring us, once a day she would bring us food.</span> <span id="s2202">And then one day somebody must have seen her do it, and they called the -- the SS, and they followed her while she was walking, bringing us food, and she started yelling to us, “Save yourselves, save yourselves,” and we were, you know, o -- i-in -- in the attic of the barn, and so my mother and sister, in the back, you know, everything is wooden, you know, panels, broke two wooden panels, and we jumped like two stories down and we ran and we escaped.</span> <span id="s2203">So, when I look at this barn, it reminds me as to what happened 55 years ago.</span> <span id="s2204">If I see a German Shepherd, that really kills me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2205">Q: How about you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2206">A: My stomach --</span></p> <p><span id="s2207">Q: I’m sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s2208">A: -- jumps.</span> <span id="s2209">Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2210">Q: No, I was just thinking of -- of German, and I just wondered about, have you ever had any German friends in America?</span></p> <p><span id="s2211">A: No.</span> <span id="s2212">Mm-mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2213">Q: Never will?</span></p> <p><span id="s2214">A: No.</span> <span id="s2215">In fact, I never will, and when I hear that language, it -- my stomach jumps.</span> <span id="s2216">I sweat.</span> <span id="s2217">I can’t -- the language, just the language, upsets me so.</span> <span id="s2218">So no, I don’t think I could ever -- and I’m very broadminded, really, but a-a-and I know that today’s generation had absolutely nothing to do, you know, with the past generation, yet and all, I couldn’t talk because it would bring back memories.</span> <span id="s2219">Just by looking and saying, well that person comes from the country that took away my loved ones.</span> <span id="s2220">So, I’d rather not -- not have any connection.</span></p> <p><span id="s2221">Q: Not even German Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s2222">A: Well, that is a little different, cause the German Jews had nothing to do with the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s2223">Unfortunately, they were so -- they felt so secure in Germany before World War Two, that unfortunate, they were hit just as bad with the Holocaust, as the European Jew.</span> <span id="s2224">Same thing happened to them.</span> <span id="s2225">So, you know, it’s two different things.</span> <span id="s2226">Talking to someone whose grandparents we-were involved in -- in my -- in my life, and talking about a German Jew, who went through almost the same as the European Jew.</span> <span id="s2227">So it’s two different things, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2228">Q: Do you, or have you been able to, from the beginning, or at any point in your marriage, been able to talk with your husband about your experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s2229">A: Mostly he -- Believe it or not, he talks mostly, about his experience.</span> <span id="s2230">You know, he -- he was born in Germany, and -- and at the age of nine, my mother-in-law, you know, in thir -- that was in ’39, she realized that it’s going to -- it -- the situation is very bad, and the sooner they get out of Germany, the better off they are.</span> <span id="s2231">And my father-in-law was already, at that time in labor camp.</span> <span id="s2232">So the only -- the only way for my mother-in-law to get her husband out of the labor camp, is to get a visa and get out of the country.</span> <span id="s2233">So, she went through quite a bit, traveling all over the united s -- all over Germany, to try and get a visa, to get out of the country, and finally they got a visa to go to Shanghai.</span> <span id="s2234">And so he has quite an experience himself, you know, specially the Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s2235">So, he usually talks about it, and I listen.</span></p> <p><span id="s2236">Q: You lived in Shanghai for how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s2237">A: Nine years.</span> <span id="s2238">He lived --</span></p> <p><span id="s2239">Q: So, he speaks Chinese?</span></p> <p><span id="s2240">A: No.</span> <span id="s2241">They -- Because, you see, they were in a ghetto.</span> <span id="s2242">So they used German, they spoke German.</span> <span id="s2243">Perhaps they spoke a little Chinese, you know, when they went out to do their shopping, you know, in the market.</span></p> <p><span id="s2244">Q: It was a ghetto set up especially for --</span></p> <p><span id="s2245">A: Yes, it was a ghetto, just exactly for the German Jews and the European Jews.</span> <span id="s2246">All the Jews that -- that came to Shanghai.</span> <span id="s2247">They all lived in -- in a -- in -- in a ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s2248">Q: What years was he there?</span></p> <p><span id="s2249">A: From ’39 to ’47.</span></p> <p><span id="s2250">Q: I have interviewed a survivor --</span></p> <p><span id="s2251">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2252">Q: -- who lived in --</span></p> <p><span id="s2253">A: Shanghai?</span></p> <p><span id="s2254">Q: Shanghai, and Kobe, Japan.</span></p> <p><span id="s2255">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2256">Q: So maybe when I meet your husband tonight, we’ll talk about it.</span> <span id="s2257">But, do you mean, when you met each other, you knew that he was a survivor, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s2258">A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2259">Q: And did you never discuss what happened to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2260">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2261">Q: Never?</span> <span id="s2262">Y -- Does he --</span></p> <p><span id="s2263">A: As I said, occasionally, I will tell him some -- some kind of an experience that happened to me, if it relates to something else.</span> <span id="s2264">But, no --</span></p> <p><span id="s2265">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s2266">A: -- we don’t really -- I don’t really know.</span> <span id="s2267">Would you believe that?</span> <span id="s2268">I don’t really know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2269">Q: I just wonder if the -- the nightmares that happen, after discussing it with someone like me, who you never knew, might be changed a little bit, if you shared it with your immediate family.</span></p> <p><span id="s2270">A: You know, I think that maybe the reason why I would -- and actually, when I -- I o-only tell strangers when I’m asked.</span></p> <p><span id="s2271">Q: Oh, sure, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2272">A: You understand?</span> <span id="s2273">Yeah.</span> <span id="s2274">So I think th -- I -- I think that the reason why it’s easier for me to talk with a stranger about the Holocaust, is because I want the world to know.</span> <span id="s2275">And the reason, I think, why I do not discuss it with my family, I mean, you know, really sitting down and talk about it, although my children did watch the tape, is because A, I know my husband went through his share of experiences, like starvation, you know.</span> <span id="s2276">So, he went through his own, and I just don’t think he needs any more from my side, do you understand?</span> <span id="s2277">Knowing from my side.</span> <span id="s2278">I-I think maybe that’s the reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s2279">Q: You’re protecting him?</span></p> <p><span id="s2280">A: In a certain way, I think so.</span> <span id="s2281">I think that -- that must be the reason.</span> <span id="s2282">This is why I can sit with you and I can talk and tell you my life, where I just don’t get to do that -- my husband or anybody else in the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s2283">Q: I mentioned -- I mean, you mentioned that your children wa-watched the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s2284">A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2285">Q: Did your husband watch, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s2286">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2287">Q: So, were you with your children when they watched?</span></p> <p><span id="s2288">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2289">Q: Did they get back to you immediately, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s2290">A: They said nothing.</span> <span id="s2291">Isn’t it amazing?</span> <span id="s2292">They do not discuss it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2293">Q: Do you think that’s to protect you, or themselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s2294">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2295">I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s2296">It -- It’s very interesting.</span> <span id="s2297">You know, I -- I never really asked them, and -- and they never really sit down and -- and say, “Well, how do you feel as to what happened?”</span> <span id="s2298">Or, you know, “How do you cope with what happened?”</span> <span id="s2299">I guess they see me that I’m coping with it, and they see me that I’m -- I’m strong, the way I was, you know, the way I’m portrayed on the -- on -- on the -- on the tape, you know, so -- in the tape, actually.</span> <span id="s2300">So, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2301">I-It’s -- It’s a good point.</span></p> <p><span id="s2302">Q: Families in general, I guess, don’t discuss very deep things, often.</span></p> <p><span id="s2303">A: Probably not.</span> <span id="s2304">Yes, prob --</span></p> <p><span id="s2305">Q: Except maybe at funerals, I -- I think sometimes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2306">A: Oh, that’s sad.</span> <span id="s2307">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2308">Q: I’m going back a little further, just so we can move on --</span></p> <p><span id="s2309">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2310">Q: -- to your time in Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s2311">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2312">Q: There were some gaps in the experience.</span> <span id="s2313">When you talked about being involved, you were helping Moroccan Jewish refugees.</span></p> <p><span id="s2314">A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2315">Q: I wonder how you became involved with the work.</span> <span id="s2316">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s2317">A: Well, it -- i -- how very simple.</span> <span id="s2318">I -- I did not go to school, cause we were there temporarily.</span> <span id="s2319">We really didn’t know how long we are going to stay, so it was a question, maybe a month or two, it wind up to be six months, that’s a different story, but in the meantime, I did not go to school.</span> <span id="s2320">And my house was always a house where my mother always did for the needy.</span> <span id="s2321">She always did things for people.</span> <span id="s2322">So, I guess, to me that was very natural.</span> <span id="s2323">If I’m not going to school, I have the time to help others.</span> <span id="s2324">And that’s what you do, you -- you know, they need clothing, you -- you get together clothing from other people, you put it in the valise, and wicl -- and food, you go to bakeries, you -- you [indecipherable] need -- in Jewish it’s shnorer, you know that means you -- you get together s -- food and whatever they need.</span> <span id="s2325">Just pack it up and you take it to those people and you give it to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2326">Q: But I got the impression this was an organized --</span></p> <p><span id="s2327">A: No, it was my own --</span></p> <p><span id="s2328">Q: -- relief effort.</span></p> <p><span id="s2329">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2330">Q: Your own, you -- the only --</span></p> <p><span id="s2331">A: My very own thinking, my very own doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2332">Q: Do you remember how -- what -- when you saw them needy, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s2333">A: Oh, I -- Well, first of all, we -- we her -- we heard about those people.</span> <span id="s2334">That’s how I got to know where they live.</span> <span id="s2335">I-I don’t exactly remember the area in Paris, but it must have been outside of Paris, because it was like, on a hill.</span> <span id="s2336">And -- And -- And there was maybe, in that one big room, I don’t know, maybe 30 people, maybe 40 people, a lot of them.</span> <span id="s2337">And the smell was horrible, because there were no sanitary facilities.</span> <span id="s2338">And a lot of children and [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2339">But I did my share.</span> <span id="s2340">Every week, that’s what I used to do.</span> <span id="s2341">And then I used to babysit for, you know, they had young couples, whose wives either just gave birth and -- and had no help, so I would go and I’ll help them out, you know.</span> <span id="s2342">I be like a mother’s helper, free of charge.</span> <span id="s2343">I never -- I never accept any money.</span> <span id="s2344">That was something that we have to do, to help others.</span></p> <p><span id="s2345">Q: Now, do you -- do you take after your mother in your adult life in America?</span> <span id="s2346">Have you been involved in relief efforts, or what kind of things have you been involved in?</span></p> <p><span id="s2347">A: Well, you know, we always involved in the children’s schools.</span> <span id="s2348">Then we always involved in organizations that help children all over the world.</span> <span id="s2349">So, in my own way, you know.</span> <span id="s2350">Certain organizations you have to raise money.</span> <span id="s2351">Certain organization, you gi -- send in money.</span> <span id="s2352">Certain organizations a -- are ask you for clothing, you give them clothing, you gi -- you know, whatever, you know, whatever you can help out with.</span></p> <p><span id="s2353">Q: And you mentioned these two organizations as -- as their post-war agencies that helped you somehow.</span> <span id="s2354">Do you recall how -- how they helped you and when.</span></p> <p><span id="s2355">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s2356">Sure, of course.</span> <span id="s2357">Well, the HIAS, in -- in Germany, they used to give us clothing.</span> <span id="s2358">I mean, when we got there, we had nothing, you know, there’s -- was still the same -- the same clothing that we had from -- you know, from -- from the -- the pogroms.</span> <span id="s2359">So, they would give us clothing, and -- and food.</span> <span id="s2360">That’s that.</span> <span id="s2361">I mean, that was very good.</span> <span id="s2362">And, you know, we had a school, so we went -- I went to school.</span> <span id="s2363">They did a lot and so did the Joint.</span> <span id="s2364">They more or less the s -- on the same level, you know, they each one do their share.</span> <span id="s2365">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s2366">Q: Do you remember being amazed at being helped?</span></p> <p><span id="s2367">A: Amazed at being helped?</span> <span id="s2368">Well, I guess I took it for granted that that’s how it’s supposed to be, right?</span> <span id="s2369">I mean, if I need something, they were there to give it to me, so, as a child it was appreciated, definitely.</span> <span id="s2370">It was certainly appreciated, everything, until, you know, when I -- when I became an adult, I first realized how much effort these organizations put in, how -- how much of hard work, to get clothing, to get food, medicine, you know, necessary things for people who were in need.</span> <span id="s2371">Now, of course, I appreciate that even more and I understand all the other organizations that are -- you know, trying to do the same for other people all over the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s2372">Q: It just occurred to me, you have a very convincing aspect to yourself, engaging, that you -- perhaps we’re all born with a particular kind of nature.</span> <span id="s2373">That little girl, I’m thinking about, that you were.</span> <span id="s2374">But do you think that the skills, the survival skills you learned there, still are with you today, as far as the way you live your life, the way you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2375">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s2376">Q: -- help other people get what they want?</span></p> <p><span id="s2377">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s2378">Q: Could you tell us about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2379">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s2380">Q: Your adult -- How you think your adult was affected by that little child?</span></p> <p><span id="s2381">A: Well, my adult life is very much connected to my little girl life, because I don’t think I was ever a little girl, a child.</span> <span id="s2382">I -- I feel, and as I -- you know, as I grew older, is that things that I did as a six year old, or a five and a half year old girl, was not of a little girl, was of a na -- a grown up person.</span> <span id="s2383">And that is something that gives me the -- the strength today, and the understanding of life today, of how to handle it.</span> <span id="s2384">And I always say, if I was able to handle it then, I certainly can handle anything today.</span> <span id="s2385">So, yeah, my -- the way I was when I was little, during those horrible days, is -- is a tremendous sort of backbone.</span></p> <p><span id="s2386">Q: But you haven’t done any public speaking about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2387">A: Nope.</span> <span id="s2388">No, I told you.</span> <span id="s2389">I think I’m very weak when it comes to that.</span> <span id="s2390">See, as strong as I am, and I think I’m a very strong person, it’s still something that I would -- you know, I feel I would probably constantly break down and -- and that would show my wi -- weakness.</span> <span id="s2391">And maybe -- maybe this is what’s stopping me from -- from speaking, and this is why I -- I really feel that in a book I can really, really express my thoughts, my -- my feelings.</span></p> <p><span id="s2392">Q: Do you keep a journal, or have you written about your feelings?</span></p> <p><span id="s2393">A: Not so much about my feelings as to, you know, my experience, but not, you know the expression, my feelings, of how you really feel, but whether the story, and not so much your feelings.</span> <span id="s2394">This is the only thing that’s left from my father, and as you know, I was six years old when he was killed, and so I’ve been without a father since then.</span> <span id="s2395">And I didn’t want to leave him, and I begged him he should go with me, but he said, “No, you have to go with your mother, and I’ll come later.”</span> <span id="s2396">But obviously it was too late.</span> <span id="s2397">He -- If he tried to escape, he probably was caught by the Germans, by the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s2398">So, this is the only thing that’s left of my father, that’s the tie that he wore on his wedding day.</span> <span id="s2399">Can you imagine how many years this is?</span> <span id="s2400">Look at what --</span></p> <p><span id="s2401">Q: And your mother kept it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2402">A: Well, no, no, you see, we -- we found it with some of our pictures by our next door neighbors.</span> <span id="s2403">We didn’t -- We were not able to keep anything.</span> <span id="s2404">When we left our home, we could only take the necessities.</span> <span id="s2405">We were not allowed to take anything else.</span> <span id="s2406">But then when we left home, neighbors went in and each one helped themselves with whatever there was.</span> <span id="s2407">And -- And -- And some things they gave us back, so there was some pictures and -- and this tie.</span> <span id="s2408">They gave them back, so I-I want to show you, I ha -- we have a picture, on the wall, that’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s2409">Q: Did your mother keep that tie?</span></p> <p><span id="s2410">A: Yeah, yeah, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s2411">Q: It’s beautifully woven.</span></p> <p><span id="s2412">A: Yeah, isn’t it something?</span> <span id="s2413">A-And look, you see how worn it is?</span> <span id="s2414">You know how many years he wore it?</span> <span id="s2415">I mean, I-I -- I -- It was, let’s see, how many years was it?</span> <span id="s2416">Were they married when -- when my brother was over 18, my si -- let’s see, my brother must have been 18, so they must have been married 20 years.</span> <span id="s2417">20 years, and today is -- 20 years was in the 40’s, so this is like 70 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s2418">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s2419">A: Okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s2420">Q: What else do you want to show me?</span></p> <p><span id="s2421">A: I wanted you to see the -- the wedding pictures, so you’ll see the tie.</span></p> <p><span id="s2422">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2423">A: There’s a picture hanging there.</span> <span id="s2424">Now I have heart palpitations.</span></p> <p><span id="s2425">Q: Do you really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2426">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2427">Q: Do you want to stop?</span></p> <p><span id="s2428">A: No.</span> <span id="s2429">See --</span></p> <p><span id="s2430">Q: We’re looking at a picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s2431">A: Yeah, we are looking at a picture.</span> <span id="s2432">These were actually two separate pictures.</span> <span id="s2433">It was one picture of my mother, and another picture of my father.</span> <span id="s2434">The picture of my father is the day of their wedding, and the tie that he is wearing at their wedding, on their wedding day, is the tie that I am holding in my hand now, which is about 70 - 75 years later, that -- no, that’s how old the tie is, and you can see it’s -- it’s ripped and torn, but it’s still something to hold onto.</span> <span id="s2435">And so, what I did is, my mother’s picture was very t-torn and -- and -- and -- and scratched and everything else, I gave this, the two pictures to a photographer, and he put them together.</span> <span id="s2436">Now, this picture is later on in life when -- when my mother was already a mother, she had my brother at that time.</span> <span id="s2437">So, my father looks so much younger here, because he was, you know, they were young when they got married, but since it’s put together -- but to me, it’s a very -- it’s the only picture that I have of the two of them, cause all the other pictures were just, you know, lost, or burned or whatever, I don’t know whatever happened to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2438">Q: Are they both from the same country?</span></p> <p><span id="s2439">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s2440">They were both from -- from the Ukraine, and they were both from the same town and my father was terribly handsome, and one of my granddaughters, when I look at her, her eyes, I always see my father.</span> <span id="s2441">And, as I mentioned before, I-I -- I do carry a certain, I-I guess anger, cause my father swore to me that when I -- the evening that we were supposed to escape from the ghetto, I wanted him to come with me -- End of Tape Five, Side A Beginning Tape Five, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s2442">A: See, would you -- would you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2443">Q: This is tape two, side B, Frima Laub continued.</span></p> <p><span id="s2444">A: You want to put it now, or want me to hold it?</span> <span id="s2445">Would you ever think that someone in their 60, would still cry, because --</span></p> <p><span id="s2446">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2447">A: -- because my father disappointed me.</span> <span id="s2448">I wanted him to go with me to escape from the ghetto, and we could not escape together, I mean, the whole family together, so we really had to separate.</span> <span id="s2449">So I wanted to --</span></p> <p><span id="s2450">Q: Why did you have to separate?</span></p> <p><span id="s2451">A: Because a ghetto is something that is surrounded by barbed wire, with electrical wires on top, with Germans and German shepherds watching you.</span> <span id="s2452">And that means, in order to escape, if they see too many people, then they suspect that you are planning to do something, and they’ll kill you on the spot.</span> <span id="s2453">So, we had to do it, in order to escape, as individually, where they will not suspect or think you might be doing something or trying to escape.</span> <span id="s2454">So, I -- I wanted my father to go with me, and then -- and then my mother would go on her own, then my sister would go on her own, so, you know, they -- they -- nobody will suspect that we are -- not even the people that we lived with, you know, nobody’s supposed to know.</span> <span id="s2455">But he said, “No, you go with Mama.”</span> <span id="s2456">And I said, “But I don’t want to go, Papa.”</span> <span id="s2457">And he said, “I swear, we should live to see your brother.”</span> <span id="s2458">Cause, as you know, my brother was studying in Kiev, he was not with us during the war times -- war, you know, period.</span> <span id="s2459">He said, “We should live to see your brother, I promise I will -- I will escape, I will go.</span> <span id="s2460">But you go with Mama first, and then I’ll go, after.”</span> <span id="s2461">Well -- And -- And the way we escaped is, my mother and I, we went to a -- a secluded area of the ghetto, and we climbed out from under the -- the barbed wires.</span> <span id="s2462">I mean, you really -- we really had to be very, very low, not to trigger the electrical wiring.</span></p> <p><span id="s2463">Q: Was there anyone else with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2464">A: No.</span> <span id="s2465">My mother, myself, nobody’s supposed to know that we escaping, don’t you understa --</span></p> <p><span id="s2466">Q: And your sister, where is she?</span></p> <p><span id="s2467">A: No.</span> <span id="s2468">She stayed with my father.</span> <span id="s2469">Then, awhile later, she did the same thing, see?</span></p> <p><span id="s2470">Q: Alone?</span></p> <p><span id="s2471">A: Alone, right.</span> <span id="s2472">Well, she was already at that time, let’s see, she was 16.</span> <span id="s2473">I was six, she was 16.</span> <span id="s2474">And then -- then we made up where we going to meet, we were going to meet in one of our friend’s houses, Gentile -- Gentile friends that we had.</span> <span id="s2475">And so, my mother and I, we got there, and then about an hour later, also, my sister got there.</span> <span id="s2476">And we sat and waited for my father, and he never showed up.</span> <span id="s2477">And that was the last time I saw my father, is when I insisted that he should come with me, and he said he ke -- “You go off with Mama, and I’ll -- I’ll come later.”</span> <span id="s2478">Well, he never made it.</span> <span id="s2479">And then, after the war, you know, when we came back, we were all asking if somebody saw my father.</span> <span id="s2480">And some of the neighbors said they saw him walking in the middle of the street with two SS men, and that was that.</span> <span id="s2481">And -- And -- And nobody ever saw him again.</span></p> <p><span id="s2482">Q: I want to stay with this moment, being angry with him --</span></p> <p><span id="s2483">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2484">Q: -- for that, because it -- if I were writing your story, I could see how you could grow up feeling abandoned by your father, but also by your mother, who left you.</span> <span id="s2485">And I wonder if you could even think for a minute.</span> <span id="s2486">Has this situation repeated itself in your adult life?</span></p> <p><span id="s2487">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2488">Q: Could you tell me about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2489">A: Well, in my adult life, I -- I always felt that I have to face the world alone, that I cannot count on anyone, not even my children.</span> <span id="s2490">That I must do it on my own.</span> <span id="s2491">And many times, I was thinking I have a very good title for my book.</span> <span id="s2492">Always alone, and a step ahead of my enemy.</span> <span id="s2493">But I always -- that’s true, I always feel alone, like I -- I -- I -- I always feel I can’t count on anyone.</span> <span id="s2494">I don’t have a shoulder to cry on, I must cry alone, I must do things alone, I must build alone, plan alone, everything alone.</span> <span id="s2495">But I also feel that, because I had to do these things alone when I was little, I certainly can do them alone now.</span> <span id="s2496">That doesn’t mean that it -- I don’t get depressed.</span> <span id="s2497">I do.</span> <span id="s2498">But then I get back on my feet again and I just keep going, cause I know just like I knew then, I cannot stop.</span> <span id="s2499">I cannot stop in the middle of the street, I must keep on walking and walking.</span> <span id="s2500">And you know something else?</span> <span id="s2501">Today, I cannot stay at home.</span> <span id="s2502">I get up in the morning, and I can’t wait to get out of the house.</span> <span id="s2503">And I want to work and I’m very busy at work, and I’m very happy at work.</span> <span id="s2504">It’s very stressful job, but that’s a different story, a-and sometimes it’s heartbreaking when you see those children with problems.</span> <span id="s2505">And then when I leave work, I don’t go home, I’m always busy in the street, doing things.</span> <span id="s2506">And I always wonder if that is the part of my past, where that’s what I did in the morning.</span> <span id="s2507">I got up, right?</span> <span id="s2508">I -- I prayed, I shook off the hay, I put my scarf on, my cross on and out I went for the whole day and then came back at night, when everybody was already sleeping.</span> <span id="s2509">I think that’s part of my past.</span> <span id="s2510">And that’s what I do today, I can’t stay home.</span> <span id="s2511">Always on the go, always moving, like a Gypsy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2512">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s2513">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2514">And I always said, I always feel alone, and that -- that is -- you know, I just never thought about it until you brought it up right just now.</span> <span id="s2515">Yeah.</span> <span id="s2516">Very much a connection with my past.</span></p> <p><span id="s2517">Q: Even though you’ve chosen, you’ve made the decision, haven’t you, not to share this with your husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s2518">A: Maybe a -- Maybe I feel that he could never understand.</span> <span id="s2519">Because, you see, when I was alone, I made my own decisions.</span> <span id="s2520">And -- A-A-And I -- I felt sure about the decisions.</span> <span id="s2521">See, I -- I never doubt it.</span> <span id="s2522">I had to do something, I just went ahead and I did it.</span> <span id="s2523">It -- It’s not that I was thinking or shivering, or -- or being afraid.</span> <span id="s2524">I-I -- I knew one thing, there’s no two ways about it.</span> <span id="s2525">This is what I have to do, this is what I have to do.</span> <span id="s2526">And I told you -- I think I told you, that once during the times that I was walking the streets, I walked twice on the same block, and I heard two boys saying to each other, “Sh -- Maybe she’s Jewish.”</span> <span id="s2527">Maybe -- Maybe she’s Jewish?</span> <span id="s2528">I never walked that street again.</span> <span id="s2529">Now, nobody told me that, I decided.</span> <span id="s2530">So, in my life now -- if at the age of six, I was able to make decisions and think -- I think it was an intelligent thinking, then I certainly can do it now.</span> <span id="s2531">So I said, although sometimes I -- sometimes I feel depressed because I feel I am alone, cause I can’t count on anyone, because I cannot depend on anyone, because I-I -- I can’t lean on anyone.</span> <span id="s2532">When I look back, I did it then, and I say, I can do it now, too.</span> <span id="s2533">And that’s how I keep going, ooh, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2534">Q: But you seem like you would be such a good friend and such a good wife and companion.</span> <span id="s2535">So, you seem to be able to give it, but maybe receiving is more difficult.</span> <span id="s2536">Do you think those other people really would like to be giving?</span></p> <p><span id="s2537">A: I am -- I am a -- a giver, but again, I -- I am a giver, obviously because I saw my mother give, okay?</span> <span id="s2538">Cause how else did I learn?</span> <span id="s2539">I mean, from whom, you know?</span> <span id="s2540">So, I am a giver and I enjoy giving and I do have lots of love, for everybody.</span> <span id="s2541">Lots of love for humanity.</span> <span id="s2542">But, you say receiving?</span> <span id="s2543">Yes, I would like someone to -- to listen to my life.</span> <span id="s2544">I mean, you know, someone close in my life, to listen to my life.</span> <span id="s2545">But then it’s just not materializing, so I just let it go.</span></p> <p><span id="s2546">Q: You want someone to ask you, like you said --</span></p> <p><span id="s2547">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2548">Q: -- it’s easier to talk to a stranger, because --</span></p> <p><span id="s2549">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2550">Q: -- I come in and I ask you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2551">A: Ask you, right.</span> <span id="s2552">So you ask me and I give you -- you know, I can give you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2553">Q: I imagine your -- your children and your husband have no idea you would like for them to ask you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2554">A: Maybe they don’t, and maybe they just are busy with their own lives.</span> <span id="s2555">You know, their lives are so busy, with their families and their children, that really, parents come in secondary.</span> <span id="s2556">And that -- that is -- that is a fact.</span> <span id="s2557">And my question is, would I want it different?</span> <span id="s2558">I do want that their wives and their children come first.</span> <span id="s2559">Yeah, it would be nice if they would come someday and say, “Ma, tell us, you know, what you went through when you were a little girl.</span> <span id="s2560">Tell us about your life.”</span> <span id="s2561">And if they are not doing it, then obviously they don’t have the necessity.</span> <span id="s2562">And if they don’t have the necessity, why would I want to add more responsibilities and thoughts than what they have today?</span> <span id="s2563">Tho, let him be happy, and I’ll be happy.</span> <span id="s2564">But the only problem is, remember I keep saying?</span> <span id="s2565">I never feel free.</span> <span id="s2566">I’m always thinking of, I hope nothing happens, I hope nothing happens.</span> <span id="s2567">And, will it ever go away?</span> <span id="s2568">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2569">Now, I think even more, because I have my grandchildren, and I do want my grandchildren to live in a beautiful world, with peace and -- and enjoy, because the world is beautiful, and there are so many beautiful people.</span> <span id="s2570">It just that there is also a lot not such beautiful people, who might just harm you.</span> <span id="s2571">And it’s always in back of my mind.</span> <span id="s2572">So, all I do is, I do a lot of praying.</span> <span id="s2573">Remember, I told you I pray for peace on earth, which I think is very important and peace in Israel, and oh --</span></p> <p><span id="s2574">Q: But personally, we’re -- we’re -- we’re talking about you, personally, right now, do you -- do you ever pray that someone might -- someone close to you, as you say, might -- might ask you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2575">A: Well it would be nice, I would like that very much.</span> <span id="s2576">Yeah, I would, you see, so if they would ask me, I would tell them.</span> <span id="s2577">Cause I think they can learn a lot from my -- you know, from my experience, but on the other hand, maybe -- maybe they would be upset, or maybe it would frighten them.</span> <span id="s2578">Maybe it’s -- won’t be so good for them, you know, e-every person is an individualist, and -- and -- and can take things differently.</span></p> <p><span id="s2579">Q: Wouldn’t it be interesting if, on the other hand, your -- your companion, your husband, had been all these years wondering, what is it that I have not done, that Frima wants?</span> <span id="s2580">What is it?</span> <span id="s2581">All these years, that he has no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s2582">A: No, he probably does not, cause he lives in a different world, he lives in a world of his own.</span> <span id="s2583">So he just doesn’t think that others have necessities, and he’s just, you know, he just has his own world.</span> <span id="s2584">And sometimes I think we’re in two different worlds, but listen, we can’t have everything, so I don’t expect everything from everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s2585">Q: Well, you take care [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2586">A: Yeah, that’s me, right.</span> <span id="s2587">That’s me, and I take care and I give without expecting anything in return.</span> <span id="s2588">Although s -- I -- it would be nice, it would make me very happy if -- if there would be such a thing as Frima, here is my shoulder.</span> <span id="s2589">That would feel very good, because I never had anyone giving me a shoulder, or -- you know, or being there for me, or helping me, you know, to cope.</span> <span id="s2590">I -- I had to learn on my own, how to do it, so I had a lesson.</span> <span id="s2591">Unfortunately that lesson was when I was a little girl.</span> <span id="s2592">That’s what I learned.</span></p> <p><span id="s2593">Q: Well, you know, I think what you’re describing is a -- a feeling that a lot of artists have, of the idea that -- that you want to write, maybe a key to open a door of support for you to write the book.</span></p> <p><span id="s2594">A: Yeah, I -- I think so.</span> <span id="s2595">I mean, I -- I feel that beside, that this will give me a chance, really, maybe, to get it off my chest, beside I -- I -- I also feel that besides getting it off my chest, is also feeling that I can help others, you understand?</span> <span id="s2596">I can transmit my strength.</span> <span id="s2597">I can transmit my knowledge, my experience, so they can be more careful in the future and nothing should happen to them, you know?</span> <span id="s2598">Or, if things are bad, they know what to do, they’ll -- they’ll just, you know, think, hey, she did it, I can do it.</span> <span id="s2599">And that would make me happy, knowing that I’m helping other people, especially the younger people, you know, to -- you know, to learn and to get the strength.</span> <span id="s2600">It’s very important to have strength, and believe.</span> <span id="s2601">I think prayer is a fantastic thing, it really is.</span> <span id="s2602">It can really make you very strong, and -- a-and very, you know, knowledgeable.</span> <span id="s2603">I mean, to do things.</span> <span id="s2604">Cause when you feel that -- that somebody is there for you, you can move mountains.</span></p> <p><span id="s2605">Q: So even though you don’t necessarily feel the reciprocal support from your immediate inner circle, do you feel that from a higher being?</span></p> <p><span id="s2606">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2607">Q: Do you -- Do you allow yourself to receive that support?</span></p> <p><span id="s2608">A: Yup.</span> <span id="s2609">Well, I -- I don’t mind getting support.</span> <span id="s2610">It’s good to know that you can lean on someone.</span> <span id="s2611">It makes things just a little bit easier.</span> <span id="s2612">Regardless if that someone can help you or not, it -- it’s -- you know, it’s good to feel you’re sharing something with someone.</span> <span id="s2613">But again, when I look back to my childhood, I didn’t get much then, so if I don’t get much now, it’s okay.</span> <span id="s2614">I can survive, regardless.</span></p> <p><span id="s2615">Q: But you talk about prayer, prayer is really putting out a petition.</span> <span id="s2616">What about the part of prayer which is receiving support of -- a support from a higher being?</span></p> <p><span id="s2617">A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2618">Q: Evidently, you can do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2619">A: Yeah, yeah, because when you believe in what you’re praying, you have to believe, first of all, you have to believe.</span> <span id="s2620">If you believe in what you’re praying, then this is where you get strength from, and this is where, you know, you are -- you are at peace with whatever you do, because you know -- you feel you did it right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2621">Q: And have you been a member of survivor organizations or any group of survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s2622">A: Well, I -- you know, I always am connected with them.</span> <span id="s2623">Personally involved, I’m not.</span> <span id="s2624">Again, I can’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s2625">Q: Why -- Why can’t you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2626">A: Because it brings back memories, and when they talk about it, it brings back memories.</span> <span id="s2627">So I think in my own way, I -- I just cannot cope with the past, you know what I’m saying?</span> <span id="s2628">I live in the past, but yet, I get up -- very upset and so I -- I’m not involved, but I’m connected.</span></p> <p><span id="s2629">Q: In -- In -- Through your synagogue, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s2630">A: Well, as I said, I -- In -- When I say connected, whatever they run, you know, for -- for the Holocaust, let’s say memorial or Holocaust Remembrance Day or something, I mean, we go.</span> <span id="s2631">That does not mean that I don’t get upse -- I’m not upset for a whole week at least, you know, because I went and I listened and I -- and I saw the survivors and I listened to other survivors, it does upset me very much.</span> <span id="s2632">And so I -- Personally, I am not -- you know, not involved personally, just --</span></p> <p><span id="s2633">Q: Do you feel like then, that you can’t be open to their stories, because it would be too painful?</span></p> <p><span id="s2634">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2635">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2636">And you know that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2637">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2638">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2639">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2640">Q: Have you ever felt that people who were not Holocaust survivors, could understand?</span></p> <p><span id="s2641">A: They can’t.</span> <span id="s2642">It’s absolutely impossible.</span></p> <p><span id="s2643">Q: Was there anyone in your family who you could talk with?</span> <span id="s2644">You never talk much about your sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s2645">A: We never talk about the Holocaust either.</span> <span id="s2646">She’s in Israel right now, but we never spoke about the Holocaust either.</span></p> <p><span id="s2647">Q: She lives in Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s2648">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2649">Q: So you, I assume, have visited Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s2650">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2651">Q: Never?</span></p> <p><span id="s2652">A: Never.</span></p> <p><span id="s2653">Q: Is the fate of Israel, though, interest -- of interest to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2654">A: Very much so.</span></p> <p><span id="s2655">Q: And how long does your sister live there?</span></p> <p><span id="s2656">A: Oh, about five, six years.</span> <span id="s2657">About five or six years.</span></p> <p><span id="s2658">Q: She moved from [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2659">A: From -- From the United States, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2660">Q: From near you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2661">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2662">Oh, well, we didn’t live exactly nearby.</span> <span id="s2663">She used to live in Staten Island, then they moved to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s2664">Q: Did you see her on holidays?</span></p> <p><span id="s2665">A: Oh, when they were liv -- were -- lived here, yeah sure, we did.</span> <span id="s2666">But now, you know, things ha --</span></p> <p><span id="s2667">Q: So you were close in a way?</span></p> <p><span id="s2668">A: We were -- We could not be very close, because there was a 10 year difference.</span> <span id="s2669">But besides the 10 years difference is also the generation, see?</span> <span id="s2670">So, when you’re talking 10 years, she could never understand her little sister and I could never understand her world, cause she lived in a different world, so the two of us really lived in two separate worlds.</span> <span id="s2671">The only thing that we had in common is the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s2672">And we never discussed it and we never spoke about it, and that was that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2673">Q: You know, we are all so different from the inside and the outside.</span> <span id="s2674">When I see you pick me up at the train and I see that bright hat with flowers, and you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s2675">A: Colorful.</span></p> <p><span id="s2676">Q: -- such a -- a great hostess and stuff.</span> <span id="s2677">Do you think anyone knows some of the things you’ve shared today, about in-inside?</span></p> <p><span id="s2678">A: Nope.</span></p> <p><span id="s2679">Q: How you feel?</span></p> <p><span id="s2680">A: Nope.</span></p> <p><span id="s2681">Q: How serious you are?</span></p> <p><span id="s2682">A: Serious in what respect?</span> <span id="s2683">As -- My feelings?</span></p> <p><span id="s2684">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2685">A: I don’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s2686">Q: Well, you live with a lot of the pain of the past.</span></p> <p><span id="s2687">A: Oh yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s2688">I live with a lot of pain.</span></p> <p><span id="s2689">Q: Does that not give you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2690">A: And disappointment, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2691">Q: -- physical ailments?</span></p> <p><span id="s2692">A: Well, it probably does, but then, there’s nothing we can do about it.</span> <span id="s2693">We just have to keep on going.</span></p> <p><span id="s2694">Q: Of all the things that you’ve mentioned to me, it seems that your job is the -- is the place where you feel most that you can reach out --</span></p> <p><span id="s2695">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2696">Q: -- and understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s2697">A: That’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s2698">Q: Do you feel your experiences have made you a -- a more -- a person who can empathize with the people in pain?</span></p> <p><span id="s2699">A: With pain?</span> <span id="s2700">Probably, yeah, probably.</span> <span id="s2701">I -- I -- I think that, you know, every unfortunate experience can connect you to somebody else, with his pain, cause you’re sharing -- there’s a pain, and you can understand, you can sort of feel it, even it’s a different experience, but it’s a painful one.</span> <span id="s2702">So, that’s correct, yeah.</span> <span id="s2703">You know, you sound like a psychiatrist.</span></p> <p><span id="s2704">Q: Well, I’m not [indecipherable] psychiatrist --</span></p> <p><span id="s2705">A: Oh, that’s [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2706">Q: -- I mean, well therapist, I mean.</span> <span id="s2707">I sometimes play therapist for my friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s2708">A: Yeah, yeah, you need -- they need that, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s2709">Q: But I think it’s interesting what makes some of us identify more with people in pain.</span></p> <p><span id="s2710">A: That’s correct, yes we do.</span> <span id="s2711">But then also, it’s the person’s nature.</span></p> <p><span id="s2712">Q: It’s also our nature.</span></p> <p><span id="s2713">A: Yeah, it’s also our nature.</span></p> <p><span id="s2714">Q: Regardless of whether --</span></p> <p><span id="s2715">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s2716">Some people might go through experiences, and yet not be able to connect themselves to somebody else’s pain, you know what I’m saying?</span> <span id="s2717">They just feel theirs, that’s it.</span> <span id="s2718">They don’t feel anybody else’s.</span> <span id="s2719">But then, other people feel other people’s pain.</span> <span id="s2720">Now, I feel very much pain when -- when I hear killings, when innocent people are killed.</span> <span id="s2721">Even here, somebody is pushed on the tr -- into the tracks.</span> <span id="s2722">Or this mother with the four boys that are walking on the -- on the -- on the tracks, and these things give me pain, and -- and -- and s -- pain, a -- I mean, really pain, physical pain.</span> <span id="s2723">It’s like as if I would know them or they would be part of me, or belong to me.</span> <span id="s2724">That’s the pain I get.</span> <span id="s2725">And it takes me awhile to get them out of my mind, cause I always think about them.</span> <span id="s2726">And every time I think, I will sigh.</span> <span id="s2727">And I remember I used to work with a Black girl in my -- in my job that I had, and we were working in the business -- business office of the Brooklyn Jewish Hospital, and every time she would hear me sigh -- sigh, and why would I sigh?</span> <span id="s2728">Because every time if I thought of someone who just got killed, or -- or someone who just got stabbed, or someone something happened to, innocent people, that hurts me very much.</span> <span id="s2729">I would sigh and she would say, “Frima, you cannot do that, because with every sigh, you are aging five years.</span> <span id="s2730">So think about it,” she said, “before you know it, you’ll be full of wrinkles.</span> <span id="s2731">Stop,” she said, “stop sighing.</span> <span id="s2732">Think about yourself.”</span> <span id="s2733">I says, “I’ll try.”</span> <span id="s2734">Well, I can’t do it.</span> <span id="s2735">I still sigh.</span> <span id="s2736">But she -- that’s what she used to tell me, every time, she says, “You are sighing again?</span> <span id="s2737">That’s five years older.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2738">Q: So, most of your friends are not survivors, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s2739">A: Not most, no, not most.</span> <span id="s2740">Some.</span> <span id="s2741">Some are survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s2742">Q: And with those you don’t discuss?</span></p> <p><span id="s2743">A: No, nope.</span> <span id="s2744">As I said, we don’t really sit down and talk about experiences, but if we’re together and we’re discussing some kind of a situation in -- so someone will say, “Ah, well I did this and this in ’41, and I did this and this in ’42,” and that’s it.</span> <span id="s2745">Only what’s pertaining to our conversation, or the situation.</span> <span id="s2746">That’s it.</span> <span id="s2747">We don’t really sit and talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2748">Q: Have you been to the Memorial Museum?</span></p> <p><span id="s2749">A: Yeah, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2750">Q: I know you have, but did you go with your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s2751">A: I went with my husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s2752">Q: Did you all have a discussion after going?</span></p> <p><span id="s2753">A: Well, usually we were discussing why we would stop and -- and look at certain pictures, and we would discuss the horrors.</span> <span id="s2754">And then of course I start crying, so that’s the end of the discussion.</span></p> <p><span id="s2755">Q: And how did he respond when you cried?</span></p> <p><span id="s2756">A: Nothing.</span> <span id="s2757">I guess, you know, they feel you have to cry sometimes, if that makes you feel better --</span></p> <p><span id="s2758">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2759">A: Not exactly, doesn’t make me feel better, but I --</span></p> <p><span id="s2760">Q: No arm on the shoulder?</span></p> <p><span id="s2761">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2762">Q: Maybe he wanted to cry, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s2763">A: Maybe, but -- but again, that’s probably how -- how people feel.</span> <span id="s2764">If you are crying, you need that cry, and maybe by crying, you’ll feel better.</span> <span id="s2765">The mat -- matter of fact is, you don’t feel better, but you can’t help it.</span> <span id="s2766">It just comes on because it really hits you inside.</span> <span id="s2767">You are looking at something that -- that you lived with, or similarly, you know, it’s -- it’s -- it’s a connection, so -- but that’s what it is, that’s what it is.</span> <span id="s2768">So hey, we can’t stop on -- on ceremonies, we haven’t got the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2769">Q: Do you think that if the museum was giving i -- a special exhibit on child survivors, and you were asked to participate in a group --</span></p> <p><span id="s2770">A: Yeah, I would go.</span></p> <p><span id="s2771">Q: You would?</span></p> <p><span id="s2772">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2773">Q: How would that be different?</span></p> <p><span id="s2774">A: Again, it would be because I feel that I’m giving something that’s important.</span></p> <p><span id="s2775">Q: I think they are doing that, by the way.</span> <span id="s2776">I think they are having an exhibit in the future on --</span></p> <p><span id="s2777">A: On the children?</span></p> <p><span id="s2778">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2779">A: I would come down.</span></p> <p><span id="s2780">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2781">And I’ve interviewed -- since I met you, I went -- I -- I met you in November, and then I went to -- I was in California in January, to visit my uncle, but also interviewed a child survivor.</span></p> <p><span id="s2782">A: How old was that child?</span> <span id="s2783">Must have been older.</span> <span id="s2784">I think I’m one of the youngest survivors in this world, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s2785">Q: Yeah, I think you must be.</span></p> <p><span id="s2786">A: I think, cause it star -- the war -- World War Two started, by us, when I was five years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s2787">Q: Yeah, she was 60-something --</span></p> <p><span id="s2788">A: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s2789">Q: -- and very active in Civil Rights, and very -- speaking every week, speaking every week, and I told her I would love for her to meet you and for you to meet her.</span></p> <p><span id="s2790">A: Yeah, well.</span></p> <p><span id="s2791">Q: Cause I thought the two of you could give each other so much.</span></p> <p><span id="s2792">A: Support.</span></p> <p><span id="s2793">Q: Literally.</span></p> <p><span id="s2794">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2795">Q: I -- I think our lives are changed when we meet -- under the right circumstances, when we meet the right --</span></p> <p><span id="s2796">A: Was she also in the ghetto, or she was in concentration camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s2797">Q: She was -- She ended up in Denmark.</span></p> <p><span id="s2798">A: Oh, okay, from a ghetto --</span></p> <p><span id="s2799">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2800">A: -- or concentration camp?</span> <span id="s2801">From a ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s2802">Q: Concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2803">A: Well, she was --</span></p> <p><span id="s2804">Q: Concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2805">A: Oh yeah?</span> <span id="s2806">She was lucky.</span> <span id="s2807">See, I always look at --</span></p> <p><span id="s2808">Q: She wasn’t lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s2809">A: Well, she survived.</span> <span id="s2810">That’s what I call lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s2811">Q: Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2812">A: Do you understand?</span></p> <p><span id="s2813">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2814">A: None of us were lucky lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s2815">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2816">A: But we survived, and that is already a little luck, right?</span> <span id="s2817">So we live with pain for the rest of our lives, because we lost an awful lot.</span> <span id="s2818">We gave a lot of our loved ones away, for no reason.</span> <span id="s2819">Just like that, poof.</span> <span id="s2820">So -- End of Tape Five Side B Beginning Tape Six, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s2821">Q: This is tape three, side A, of a second audio follow up interview with Frima Laub, conducted by Ginger Miles, on June third, 1999, for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.</span> <span id="s2822">The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making this interview possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s2823">A: Yeah, you know, when you mentioned about the -- the lady that -- that lost her mother in the concentration camp, I want you to know that all my life, I feel that I was very, very lucky I was not in the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s2824">I mean, as much as my life was difficult and I saw lots of horrors, and -- and went through a lot of hunger, and everything else, but the fact that I was not in the concentration camps, I always say I’m lucky, and I really look up to those people from concentration camp that -- that survived, which is truly a -- an unbelievable miracle.</span> <span id="s2825">Besides that I think I’m a miracle with me, too.</span> <span id="s2826">But, yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s2827">Q: Well, I -- I get so amazed that people -- it was a miracle to get out, but then, to come over here, and everyone that I have interviewed has -- is materially secure.</span> <span id="s2828">And that has always sort of amazed me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2829">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2830">Well, you know, I say that all these, you know, survivors, we came from ashes, and we build a castle.</span> <span id="s2831">See, we all came with nothing.</span> <span id="s2832">We had nothing, and we came with -- with so much miser-misery, and -- and with so much fright.</span> <span id="s2833">I’m afraid to start all over again, but yet, we had the strength to do it, and all we were thinking is how to improve the world, how to make things better for our children.</span> <span id="s2834">And -- And we started building and building from nothing, from ashes.</span> <span id="s2835">So, I wish that other people, you know, who are really down, and -- and -- and don’t have much, they should look to -- look up to the survivors and say, look at them.</span> <span id="s2836">They came from -- from -- really from hell, and look at them.</span> <span id="s2837">They have a home, they make sure the children go for an education.</span> <span id="s2838">They -- They live nicely, you know?</span> <span id="s2839">They -- Their lives are -- I mean, not all are millionaires, but most of them accomplished something.</span> <span id="s2840">And the accomplishment is, they don’t -- they -- they don’t have to beg, because they all make a living somehow.</span> <span id="s2841">And their children are all educated.</span> <span id="s2842">In fact, I got to tell you this, when I lived in Brooklyn, there were 13 religious families, that’s it.</span> <span id="s2843">I mean, in that area, 13 religious families, Holocaust survivors, all of us, all 13 families.</span> <span id="s2844">Now, out of these 13 Holocaust survivor’s families, many of us never went to school.</span> <span id="s2845">Of course, I went to school, cause I was the -- you know, I was a baby when I -- when I -- when World War Two started.</span> <span id="s2846">But, they were already older, so when they came to the United States, they didn’t have the time to go to school.</span> <span id="s2847">They had to make a living, they had to survive here.</span> <span id="s2848">But out of these 13 Holocaust surviving families, we gave to the world, nine doctors.</span> <span id="s2849">Nine doctors, that’s without counting lawyers, accountant, engineer, dentist.</span> <span id="s2850">Nine doctors.</span> <span id="s2851">That means some of the families had two doctors in the families.</span></p> <p><span id="s2852">Q: What is it about the Jewish culture --</span></p> <p><span id="s2853">A: Well, well --</span></p> <p><span id="s2854">Q: -- is it faith, is it intelligence, is it --</span></p> <p><span id="s2855">A: -- no, it’s the drive A, we -- those that survived, had a drive, plus a little luck, okay?</span> <span id="s2856">So we survived.</span> <span id="s2857">Then, once we survive, we always feel that we have to improve, make things better.</span> <span id="s2858">And so the drive of accomplishment is important.</span> <span id="s2859">So these parents, even if they -- they did not have an education and they came from concentration camps, but they came here and they started working and saving and working and saving.</span> <span id="s2860">And so when they had their children, oh, now’s my chance.</span> <span id="s2861">My children must get an education.</span> <span id="s2862">And these kids went to -- you know, went through all the schooling and everything else, and are professionals.</span> <span id="s2863">It’s -- It’s the drive, and it’s the fact that we want the world to be a better place to live.</span> <span id="s2864">We want to be -- you know, bring pride to the world, and -- an-and I wish that, you know, people would look at it and say, if they can do it, I can do it.</span> <span id="s2865">And without even going through hell.</span> <span id="s2866">If these people went through hell and came out from ashes and build a castle, I can do it, too.</span> <span id="s2867">I live in a beautiful country, I have a beautiful job.</span> <span id="s2868">All I have to do is a little struggling, a little saving.</span> <span id="s2869">You know?</span> <span id="s2870">I mean, all those things go hand in hand.</span> <span id="s2871">They can do it, too.</span> <span id="s2872">Especially, I think the young generation should look at it.</span> <span id="s2873">See?</span> <span id="s2874">And -- And -- And I want you to know that every family, from the Holocaust survivors, they take pride in their ch -- kids, because it’s like a double accomplishment.</span> <span id="s2875">It’s, I didn’t go to school, but look at my child, he’s a professional.</span> <span id="s2876">That means they feel like it’s almost as if they did it, too, you know?</span> <span id="s2877">And they didn’t have the opportunity to do it.</span> <span id="s2878">Ah, you always keep thinking -- ah, when I was young, I wanted to be in -- in the research world.</span></p> <p><span id="s2879">Q: Yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s2880">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2881">But I had no one to support me, so instead, at the age of 13, I was supporting my mother.</span> <span id="s2882">I went out and I had the full da -- a full time job, and I went to school at night.</span></p> <p><span id="s2883">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2884">A: Yeah, and I went to school at night.</span> <span id="s2885">That -- I -- It hurts me.</span> <span id="s2886">That bothers me, that nobody in the family said, you know, “What would you like to be, and where would you like to go from here?”</span> <span id="s2887">And I knew I had a very good mind.</span> <span id="s2888">I -- I was always a very good student, I was always an A student.</span> <span id="s2889">And you know, my mother took great pride in me, and I really tried, and I wa -- I never disappointed her.</span> <span id="s2890">And yet, you know, I -- I couldn’t continue with -- with sa --</span></p> <p><span id="s2891">Q: How far did you go in school?</span></p> <p><span id="s2892">A: No, well, no, I -- I -- I finished high school, and -- and then I came to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s2893">Q: Now that’s something I was curious about there.</span> <span id="s2894">There seemed to be such a almost idyllic life in some ways that you described it, in Cuba.</span> <span id="s2895">I guess, compared to the Holocaust, it was, and you were with family.</span> <span id="s2896">But, can you think back of some underlying dissatisfactions that you had in Cuba?</span></p> <p><span id="s2897">A: Oh well, oh well, there is always underlying dissatisfaction.</span> <span id="s2898">A lot of it, I think, was due that I was -- I was angry the fact that I couldn’t be what I wanted to be, and that I wasn’t -- I was not given the opportunity to be.</span> <span id="s2899">Like, for example, here -- and today we have all kinds of grants, and -- and -- and you can, you know, get a scholarship.</span> <span id="s2900">In those years there was no such thing.</span> <span id="s2901">So, privately, I couldn’t go anyplace, because we didn’t have the money, and my mother was a widow, and we had nothing.</span> <span id="s2902">And nobody in the family even thought of -- of saying, well, you know, we’ll get together and perhaps support you and -- and -- and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2903">Q: Well, let me ask you now, Frima.</span></p> <p><span id="s2904">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2905">Q: Let’s say that you got a scholarship --</span></p> <p><span id="s2906">A: Oh, I would love to.</span></p> <p><span id="s2907">Q: -- for next semester.</span></p> <p><span id="s2908">A: I would run.</span></p> <p><span id="s2909">Q: What would you study?</span></p> <p><span id="s2910">A: Yeah, I would love to be in the -- in the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2911">Q: College?</span></p> <p><span id="s2912">A: No, I would love to be in research.</span> <span id="s2913">I still like to be in research.</span></p> <p><span id="s2914">Q: What kind of research?</span></p> <p><span id="s2915">A: See, I would love to find out something that can save human beings.</span> <span id="s2916">Like cancer, like diabetes.</span> <span id="s2917">I cou -- Any, anything, but mostly I think it would be diabetes and cancer.</span> <span id="s2918">I think these are two dreadful diseases, which really need a lot of research.</span> <span id="s2919">And I would really sit 24 hours a day, for that.</span> <span id="s2920">And I think I would -- I would -- I would probably find peace in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2921">Q: What would happen if you decided to take your money now and go to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s2922">A: Oh well, now.</span> <span id="s2923">Now, maybe my husband would think I’m nuts.</span> <span id="s2924">He would really take me to a psychiatrist, and say, at this stage in your life -- but I-I don’t feel my age.</span> <span id="s2925">And I feel I -- I have a lot of common sense.</span> <span id="s2926">And I -- I am always willing to try things and I am always willing to -- to discover things and look for things.</span> <span id="s2927">It amazes me, I mean, how much we can find, if we look.</span></p> <p><span id="s2928">Q: How about even just a class in something, like even if you took a class to start writing your book, with this in mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s2929">A: Oh, there is such a thing?</span> <span id="s2930">I-I never looked --</span></p> <p><span id="s2931">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2932">A: -- into that.</span> <span id="s2933">Yeah?</span> <span id="s2934">In writing there is such a thing?</span> <span id="s2935">Because we do have in -- in this area, we have adult education, or continued education, whatever you call it.</span> <span id="s2936">Well, every so often I do take, you know, different types of courses, nothing -- nothing, you know, constructive, really.</span> <span id="s2937">It’s just pleasure, something that just is good for my mind.</span> <span id="s2938">But, I’ll look into it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2939">Q: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s2940">A: I don’t know if I’ll ever become a writer, listen, I’m counting on you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2941">Q: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s2942">A: I can give you the material.</span></p> <p><span id="s2943">Q: I will help in any way I can.</span></p> <p><span id="s2944">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2945">Q: I -- I would wish you great success.</span></p> <p><span id="s2946">A: Thank you, I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2947">Q: And I --</span></p> <p><span id="s2948">A: I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2949">Q: I wondered if there’s anything else that you -- you had to say.</span> <span id="s2950">I know that you shared with me earlier that you’ve been diagnosed with diabetes.</span> <span id="s2951">Is that a new thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s2952">A: Yeah, two years ago, yeah.</span> <span id="s2953">And yet, I don’t know of anyone in my family having it.</span> <span id="s2954">At least, my mother.</span> <span id="s2955">Or maybe my father had it and he didn’t know and I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s2956">And so -- And I was never overweight, so when this hit me, I didn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s2957">When the doctor told me I had diabetes, I did not believe him, I said, it must be somebody else’s blood results, not mine.</span> <span id="s2958">And then, of course, you know, he took another blood test and the results were --</span></p> <p><span id="s2959">Q: And you -- do you take insulin, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2960">A: Not sh -- Well, right now, I’m going to one of the biggest I -- I -- I am told, one of the finest clinics, it’s called Joslin Diab-Diabetes Clinic, in Manhattan -- Diabetes C-Center, actually.</span> <span id="s2961">It’s supposed to be one of the best in the United States, or perhaps in the world.</span> <span id="s2962">Well, they’re trying different types of medication, so every two weeks I'm on a different type of medication.</span> <span id="s2963">It’s -- So far, it hasn’t worked.</span> <span id="s2964">The doctor told me there’s another medication that just came out on -- on the mar -- in -- you know, in the market, maybe we’ll try that.</span> <span id="s2965">But, as you know, I have a tremendous drive in my life.</span> <span id="s2966">I’m very -- you know, my mind is just, you have to keep going and you’ll be okay, just hang in there.</span> <span id="s2967">And I’m hanging in there.</span> <span id="s2968">And hopefully, perhaps they’ll be able to, you know, find a medication for me, and if not, well, if that what it takes, I’ll take the insulin.</span> <span id="s2969">As long --</span></p> <p><span id="s2970">Q: But you haven’t started that yet?</span></p> <p><span id="s2971">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s2972">We just sort of tested it for two weeks.</span> <span id="s2973">It didn’t do much.</span> <span id="s2974">It just didn’t do much for me.</span> <span id="s2975">But again, you know, sometimes you have to increase the dose.</span></p> <p><span id="s2976">Q: And you watch your eating?</span></p> <p><span id="s2977">A: Oh yeah, yeah, but it has nothing to do with my eating.</span></p> <p><span id="s2978">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s2979">A: Look at this, I’m -- I’m lil -- you know, I’m so skinny, I lost so much weight.</span></p> <p><span id="s2980">Q: No, but I mean, my aunt had diabetes and she -- she -- she couldn’t eat sugar.</span></p> <p><span id="s2981">A: Oh yeah, oh of cour -- that’s -- that’s passe.</span> <span id="s2982">You don’t eat -- I don’t eat sugar.</span></p> <p><span id="s2983">Q: So when you offer me a cake, you’re not thinking of eating it yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s2984">A: No, never touch it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2985">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2986">A: I don’t touch it.</span> <span id="s2987">I don’t touch anything that has sugar, although most of the things have a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s2988">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2989">A: Okay?</span> <span id="s2990">So that you cannot help, but like cake is out of the question and anything that’s sweet.</span></p> <p><span id="s2991">Q: No wine.</span></p> <p><span id="s2992">A: Don’t drink wine, I don’t eat watermelon, I don’t eat a lot of fruits that have -- that are sugar.</span> <span id="s2993">I don’t touch, well, any of this junk food that might have -- or any junk food, you know, I’m very careful [indecipherable] I -- I -- I can’t really eat junk food, because right now my -- my glucose is out of control, really, so I’m trying to be extremely careful.</span> <span id="s2994">I’m trying to eat as much protein as I can.</span> <span id="s2995">But then, I have high cholesterol, so that protein is not very good for the high cholesterol.</span> <span id="s2996">But, you know what?</span> <span id="s2997">Okay, and I also have high blood pressure, so I have the three highs.</span> <span id="s2998">I am flying high.</span> <span id="s2999">But, nothing stops me.</span> <span id="s3000">I feel okay, and I just do what I have to do.</span> <span id="s3001">I continue with my life.</span> <span id="s3002">Yeah, I feel that I-I have to do a lot of things, because time is going by very fast.</span> <span id="s3003">And I feel like, you know, I got to accomplish more, more, more than what I’ve accomplished until now.</span> <span id="s3004">Cause it’s like, you know, 60 plus.</span> <span id="s3005">I’m almost there, and then --</span></p> <p><span id="s3006">Q: Almost where?</span></p> <p><span id="s3007">A: Well, almost you know, anything can happen some -- to someone that’s in the 60’s, or it could happen in the 70’s, or could happen in the 80’s.</span> <span id="s3008">But I feel that I should accomplish more right now, while -- you know, while I still -- my mind is sharp and w -- I’m -- I still have my feelings and my marbles and my determination and my explanation, my devotion.</span> <span id="s3009">All this I would like to put on paper.</span> <span id="s3010">How about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s3011">Q: That sounds wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s3012">A: That sounds good to you, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s3013">Q: A great idea to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s3014">A: Yeah, okay.</span> <span id="s3015">So, okay, you know, survivors survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s3016">Q: Say that again.</span></p> <p><span id="s3017">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3018">Survivors will always survive.</span> <span id="s3019">You know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3020">Q: Thank you so much.</span></p> <p><span id="s3021">A: It was a pleasure talking to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s3022">End of Tape Six, Side A</span></p>
