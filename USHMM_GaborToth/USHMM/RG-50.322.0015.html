21, 1981 Interviewee: Dr. Felix Garfunkel = FG Interviewer: Carole Erich = CE</span></p> <p><span id="s2">Q: My name is Carole Erich.</span> <span id="s3">The date is July 21, 1981.</span> <span id="s4">The time is 7:00 p.m. I am in the home of Dr. Felix Garfunkel at 5593 Mad River Road in Centerville?</span></p> <p><span id="s5">A: In Washington Township.</span></p> <p><span id="s6">Q: In Washington Township, Ohio.</span> <span id="s7">Dr. Garfunkel, I want to ask you your age, please.</span></p> <p><span id="s8">A: 50.</span> <span id="s9">I just became that day before yesterday.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s11">July 19th.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: I am sorry, the 17th, July 17th.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: And the year of your birth was?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: I was born in 1931.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: And you were born where?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: In Cernauti, Romania.</span> <span id="s17">(Town is spelled by FG but could not be located in the Atlas, however after much trial including various attempts at phonetic spelling Cernovcy was located at 48.18N, 25.56E.</span> <span id="s18">This is it.</span> <span id="s19">It is on the Prut River.)</span> <span id="s20">That is the Northern part of Romania, which the Romanians got after WW1, they received that as part of the compensation, I guess.</span> <span id="s21">It became part of Romania between WW1 and WWII.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: Were your parents from the same area?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: Yes, from the same area, which had been Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: Could I please ask your father and mother’s names and your mother’s maiden name?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: My mother’s maiden name was Frieda Blumengarten.</span> <span id="s26">My father’s name is Marcus Garfunkel.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: They lived in that area?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: They have lived in the same city, they were born in that city.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: How far back in Romanian history does your family go?</span> <span id="s30">Do you have any idea?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: I could not gather a very long history back, however, I know that their parents lived there.</span> <span id="s32">They did not have any other records concerning how far back they went.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: Both sides of your family were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: I would like to ask you a little about your early childhood, in your area in Romania.</span> <span id="s36">The area where you were born.</span> <span id="s37">First of all how many brothers and sisters did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: I was an only child.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: You grew up in this area, went to school locally.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: Yes, I went to school locally.</span> <span id="s41">This was a town of about 120,000 people.</span> <span id="s42">My father was a businessman.</span> <span id="s43">We had what I would call a middle class family.</span> <span id="s44">I went to school, to kindergarten first, then to public school.</span> <span id="s45">While I was in the 3rd grade, the Russians came in since that was 1940.</span> <span id="s46">The Soviets made an arrangement with Hitler where they took a part of Romania and Poland, just north of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: You are getting a little ahead of me, but you did anticipate one question I was going to ask.</span> <span id="s48">You said your father was a businessman?</span> <span id="s49">What business was he in?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: In coal and coke - some high carbon coal for industrial usage and wood for burning, firewood.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: Did he own the company?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: He was an owner?</span> <span id="s54">How large a company was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: He had gotten it from his parents, from his father.</span> <span id="s56">It was not very large.</span> <span id="s57">You mean size?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: Yes, I am trying to get the idea of the size of his company as to whether it was affected later on by the Russians.</span> <span id="s59">(The Russians seized all private businesses, no matter how small.)</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: Yes, I would say it occupied between half an acre and an acre.</span> <span id="s61">It might have been a little larger.</span> <span id="s62">It contained a number of sheds, which had one side open.</span> <span id="s63">He still used a lot of horse drawn carts for delivery.</span> <span id="s64">He had one nicer big building, which had a scale outside of it, just like you have truck scales here on the interstate.</span> <span id="s65">There the carts or trucks would come in front of the building to be weighed.</span> <span id="s66">He had a set of people working for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: That was important.</span> <span id="s68">I wanted to establish how big an outfit it was.</span> <span id="s69">Your mother did not work?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: Did you have help in the home?</span> <span id="s72">Did she have any outside help?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: Yes, she had a young lady who helped during the day.</span> <span id="s74">I don’t remember whether it was full time or part time, but at least a few times in the week.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: She (the helper) did not necessarily become an intimate part of the family?</span> <span id="s76">Such as a live-in help?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: Yes, as a matter of fact, yes, they did have a live-in maid.</span> <span id="s78">That’s right.</span> <span id="s79">But, she was just cleaning and helping taking care of me.</span> <span id="s80">I remember that my mother was cooking.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: Was the maid a Jewish girl?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: No, she was a Romanian Christian girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: The town which you mentioned, where you were born and raised, which I am not sure I can remember or pronounce, was there a Jewish section in this town?</span> <span id="s84">Or was it a predominately Catholic town?</span> <span id="s85">Or how did it divide itself?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: It is a very interesting town in the sense that it had a combination of populations.</span> <span id="s87">It was very close to the border with the Soviet Union (the Ukraine) and what was previously a Russian province of Bessarabia (therefore it must be quite a bit further east than the Cerna River, possibly in an area which was annexed to the USSR after WWII, since the Romanians at one time sided with the Germans, and therefore the name was changed).</span> <span id="s88">Bessarabia had also become a part of Romania after WWI and the border was then on the River Dnestr.</span> <span id="s89">(FG spells it as Dniestre, however the transcriber’s Atlas shows it as Dnestri.)</span> <span id="s90">The river went through our town called the Prut.</span> <span id="s91">(FG spells this again.</span> <span id="s92">This river appears to make the boundary of the USSR, at least in 1989.)</span> <span id="s93">There was 120 km between one river and the other which was the border.</span> <span id="s94">That is about 70 miles.</span> <span id="s95">It was also close to the border with Poland, which was further northwest, but it wasn’t that close.</span> <span id="s96">The population in that town and around the town was a mixture of a lot of Germans - Schwabish (Schwabenland is Bavaria) who were in the countryside, some Ukrainians, who spoke Ukrainian, particularly in the marketplace where they came in with the groceries.</span> <span id="s97">Then there were people who came in after WWI and who administered the area and it was their language which you had to learn when you went to school, or if you wanted to get something from a public office.</span> <span id="s98">However the population, basically, all spoke German because it used to be part of Austria and there was a goodly amount of Ukrainians, and they used a Slavic language.</span> <span id="s99">So people who had been raised in that city, or who lived in that city knew several languages.</span> <span id="s100">It was an international type of a city.</span> <span id="s101">There was a section of the city that was predominately Jewish.</span> <span id="s102">There was a large Jewish population there, probably like 40,000 to 60,000.</span> <span id="s103">A good part of the city was Jewish, something like 30% to 40%.</span> <span id="s104">My understanding is that it was because there was a lot of trade going through from the west to the Soviet Union - to Russia and back (also a border town might have provided refuge to Jews fleeing from anti-Jewish pogroms under the Czars in the XIXth and early XXth centuries) also, involving Poland through that town.</span> <span id="s105">Then, when they closed all the borders, which they did, they cut off the trade.</span> <span id="s106">There were a lot of people in the adjacent province of Bessarabia, who lost their livelihood in the little villages and in the countryside, and moved into the city.</span> <span id="s107">That is why the city had a lot of people of different origins.</span> <span id="s108">They (Jews) could live any place in town.</span> <span id="s109">We did not actually live in the Jewish part of town.</span> <span id="s110">There used to be a Jewish section which had more Jewish population, but the Jewish population lived all around the town.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: You said that your family did not live in what could be called the Jewish section?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: We lived outside, but close to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: Were your neighbors predominately Catholics?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: This went with the nationality.</span> <span id="s115">You see the Ukraine is Greek-Orthodox and many of the Germans were Protestants, and some were Catholics.</span> <span id="s116">The dominant religion of the town was Greek-Orthodox, the same as Romania is.</span> <span id="s117">Russia and Romania is Greek-Orthodox.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: Very little Catholic?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: Yes, very little Catholic.</span> <span id="s120">Those who were Catholics were more liable to be refugees from Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: Then, I will ask you, in conjunction with that; what were your friendships composed of?</span> <span id="s122">the children whom you played with?</span> <span id="s123">Your associates?</span> <span id="s124">Did they tend to be from the Jewish section, or were they as integrated as the city itself?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: Most of them were from the Jewish section, I would say that almost all were.</span> <span id="s126">The city was not integrated.</span> <span id="s127">There were many different ethnic or nationality groups, who met in different areas and in the schools.</span> <span id="s128">However, the friendships which I had were mostly with Jewish kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: From what you are saying, I got the impression that although there were quite a few ethnic groups, they tended to stay within their own groups.</span> <span id="s130">To go along with that, you said that most of your friends were of the Jewish religion and background.</span> <span id="s131">Was your family Jewish Orthodox?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s133">Not completely observant, but you could call them Orthodox.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: Did they observe all the (Jewish) holidays?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: Yes, they observed all the holidays and they were very religious people.</span> <span id="s136">However, they did not observe it to the sense that the Orthodox are associated many times with a certain custom of wear (i.e., clothing - probably meaning not the Hassidic clothes, of the fur hats and the long black coats) and the custom of not cutting the sideburns.</span> <span id="s137">Not too extreme, but more in the modern sense of the Orthodox branch.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: Now you were born in 1931, which was a rather interesting year as far as the NAZI (meaning the party led by Hitler which was officially National-Socialist party.</span> <span id="s139">This party was one of the minor parties making up the German Republic with its capital in Weimar until the elections of 1933) rise to power, which became quite evident during that year.</span> <span id="s140">Can I ask you aside from the fact that you mentioned the Russians and the agreement they had with the Germans (that accord was signed in August 1939) and through which they entered into Romania; was the Jewish community in your area affected by what was taking place in Germany in the 1930’s?</span> <span id="s141">Obviously, you can’t remember from your own experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: Very slightly.</span> <span id="s143">Yes, I will be glad to answer this as best I can.</span> <span id="s144">I remember that as very small children we heard very frequently something and we were aware that the adults were very emotionally upset by listening to the radio or the speeches of Adolf Hitler and always listened to the news about what was going on, such as an invasion here or an invasion there, threat of wars.</span> <span id="s145">The adults were always huddling around the radio and had everybody be quiet so that they could hear a distant broadcast, perhaps from Germany or from wherever.</span> <span id="s146">There was tension in the city and there was anti-Semitism in the sense that the kids were frequently trying to pick fights with Jewish kids and to beat them up.</span> <span id="s147">We used to go around in groups.</span> <span id="s148">Many times we had fights.</span> <span id="s149">We realized that something serious was going on.</span> <span id="s150">That is the way it was until the Russians came in.</span> <span id="s151">One day the Russians came in unexpectedly.</span> <span id="s152">There obviously was no fight or anything.</span> <span id="s153">it was just like a parade.</span> <span id="s154">They just walked in like a parade.</span> <span id="s155">They took the administration over.</span> <span id="s156">A few days later my father went to his business and came back and said that he found a seal (at the door of his business).</span> <span id="s157">That happened to all of businesses in town.</span> <span id="s158">They all had a seal reading: “This is property of the State” on it, which continued: “Do not remove under penalty of law.”</span> <span id="s159">This meant that you would be infringing the law and that you would be arrested immediately.</span> <span id="s160">So he had to go and look for a job.</span> <span id="s161">He got a job somewhere else.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: You are getting way ahead of me again.</span> <span id="s163">First of all what year did that take place?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: In 1940.</span> <span id="s165">(The pact between Germany and Russia had been signed in August 1939 and Poland had been dismembered in September 1939.)</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: O.K., you are about 9 years old at this point.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: You said that as a child you had quite a few fights or were part of quite a few fights which were going on.</span> <span id="s169">Now aside from the childhood problems, which you had, did your parents experience anti-Semitism on their social level.</span> <span id="s170">Were they ostracized prior to this business of the Russians marching in?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: I don’t mean to say that there were a lot of fights.</span> <span id="s172">We had a very normal, very happy life.</span> <span id="s173">However, while going to school I am aware of a few times when I had to either avoid some kids who were waiting for me or get into fights.</span> <span id="s174">Whether my parents were made to feel bad?</span> <span id="s175">They were aware of anti-Semitism, but the town was so heavily divided between all these types of community that you could live totally in your community without being exposed to much.</span> <span id="s176">So I am not aware of discrimination in a great way.</span> <span id="s177">I am only talking from hearsay.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: Your parents, or the Jewish community, was apparently more frightened by what was taking place in Germany and never expected a move from the East?</span> <span id="s179">From the Russians?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: That is right.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: Had Hitler made any overtures directly in Romania?</span> <span id="s182">Had this come about by then?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: No.</span> <span id="s184">Without taking into consideration the will of the people in any way, the region was just divided up.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: Considering that the Russians and the Germans were allied at that time.</span> <span id="s186">OK, you are 9 years old, the Russians have moved in.</span> <span id="s187">Do you remember that day?</span> <span id="s188">Does your memory account for that exactly.</span> <span id="s189">You said that they marched in and just took over.</span> <span id="s190">Do you remember actually seeing this come about or is it hearsay for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: It is hearsay.</span> <span id="s192">I did not see them that day, but I saw them shortly afterward.</span> <span id="s193">I remember kind of a combination of a festive occasion and a sad occasion and an apprehensive mood in the city.</span> <span id="s194">It was not a mood of war or of immediate danger.</span> <span id="s195">It was like a parade.</span> <span id="s196">Some people, that is some Communists, came out and greeted them very happily.</span> <span id="s197">However, most people kept to themselves and stayed out of their way.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: Did you know that the Russians were working together with the Germans?</span> <span id="s199">Or did they assume that the Russians were there to protect them from the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: They were aware that there was a very terrible power, a militaristic power rising in Europe and that that was Germany.</span> <span id="s201">They were not concerned about the Russians, that much.</span> <span id="s202">So when they walked in, the people were pragmatists (probably meaning that they tried to rationalize events) and recognized the fact that this had happened.</span> <span id="s203">So of course, you had a lot of people come out and greet them and say that they are glad to see them because they were afraid of consequences later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: Sort of like the lesser of two evils?</span> <span id="s205">If there had to be someone moving in, they apparently preferred the Russians to the Germans, for obvious reasons, I assume.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: I don’t remember that that much.</span> <span id="s207">I just remember a lot of discussions, political discussions.</span> <span id="s208">I remember still better that there were some people whom my parents probably knew who, having Communist leanings, were out there and very happy.</span> <span id="s209">They were extremely happy.</span> <span id="s210">Some people kissed the horses on which the Russians were riding.</span> <span id="s211">However they also told me, and I heard them say many times, before a year had passed that they changed their minds and tried to flee the country to the West.</span> <span id="s212">They had terminated their Communism.</span> <span id="s213">A lot of people who did not know the Soviets and had a lot of Communist ideas, or ideology, considered themselves Communists.</span> <span id="s214">They were spouting their ideas and fighting for them and being jailed for them; they were later exposed to Communism and they had to live under Communism in the Soviet Union and they totally changed their ideas.</span> <span id="s215">Then they didn’t want anything to do with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: Were your parents political?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: Did they vote at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: I don’t really know.</span> <span id="s220">I don’t remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: Were they social people?</span> <span id="s222">Did they belong to clubs?</span> <span id="s223">or things of that type?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: They did most of their socializing with family.</span> <span id="s225">They both were members of large families.</span> <span id="s226">There was a large family.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: In that city?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: So you were not really isolated?</span> <span id="s230">You had a lot of cousins.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: Yes, a lot of cousins.</span> <span id="s232">Also, I had cousins in the neighboring tows 20 or 30 miles away.</span> <span id="s233">We used to travel by train to see them, or by car.</span> <span id="s234">We didn’t have a car (a car, unless it was directly relevant to one’s way of earning a living was a luxury).</span> <span id="s235">We went by bus or taxi.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: You mentioned that it was a bilingual city, actually not bilingual, but multilingual.</span> <span id="s237">How many languages did you speak?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: Three main languages were spoken there.</span> <span id="s239">My home language was German.</span> <span id="s240">I also learned some Yiddish, which is very close to German.</span> <span id="s241">(Yiddish is defined as a “High German dialect,” i.e., a dialect of German spoke in the north of Germany developed under Hebrew and Slavic influence and written in Hebrew characters.</span> <span id="s242">It was adapted to the local language in many places.)</span> <span id="s243">I heard it being spoken.</span> <span id="s244">We spoke German at home.</span> <span id="s245">I also learned Ukrainian when I went shopping with my mother.</span> <span id="s246">Then I had to learn Romanian when I went to school, when I went to kindergarten and then to school and learned to read and write.</span> <span id="s247">In school you have to know the main language.</span> <span id="s248">I picked up the language and found it very easy to learn, at least for me.</span> <span id="s249">I had a facility for languages, so I learned Romanian.</span> <span id="s250">Since then I have forgotten a lot of it.</span> <span id="s251">I learn fast and I forget some of the languages; I will later tell you why.</span> <span id="s252">Later on you will see that we moved to the Ukraine during the war.</span> <span id="s253">There I learned Russian and Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s254">Later we went to France, and there I learned French.</span> <span id="s255">Then I went to South America and I learned Spanish and when I was speaking Spanish most of the time and no Romanian since the two are a little bit similar (both are languages derived from Latin sources) I forget Romanian.</span> <span id="s256">I still understand it, but I cannot speak it any longer because I cannot think of the 4 words, they come more readily in other languages.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: And then English?</span> <span id="s258">OK, we are going back to the point where your father’s business was apparently just closed down.</span> <span id="s259">Did they take it over and run it, or did they just close it down?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: They took it over.</span> <span id="s261">I don’t think that they ran it.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: Your father was given no compensation.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: He just had to find a job.</span> <span id="s265">What kind of work did he find?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: I think that he worked for the municipality, in the sanitation department.</span> <span id="s267">Something to do in an office.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: What kind of education did he have?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: He had a high school education.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: Now at this time in 1940, what was taking place within Germany and Poland and other countries?</span> <span id="s271">You know that there was something going on at that point while the Russians are just moving in and taking over.</span> <span id="s272">You said that you were aware of what was going on in Germany at that time.</span> <span id="s273">Do you recall what it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: What was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: What the Germans were doing.</span> <span id="s276">Had they moved into Poland as yet?</span> <span id="s277">(Poland had been overrun and divided between Germany and Russia in Sept. 1939.</span> <span id="s278">The Baltic states were annexed by Russia shortly thereafter.</span> <span id="s279">Finland was attacked by Russia in the fall of 1939, but it was not actually defeated, just exhausted.</span> <span id="s280">Denmark and Norway were invaded by Germany and occupied in March-April 1940.</span> <span id="s281">Belgium, Holland and Luxembourg were invaded and occupied in May 1940 by Germany which went on to invade France, defeat it and occupy two-thirds of the country in June 1940.</span> <span id="s282">Italy attacked France in June 1940 and thereby, entered the war on the side of Germany.</span> <span id="s283">Italy invaded Albania in spring of 1940, but failed to crush it because of Greek help.</span> <span id="s284">The Germans thereupon invaded Yugoslavia and other Balkan countries driving the Greek army, who were helped by the British into Crete, where they were defeated.</span> <span id="s285">Germany attacked Russia through Poland in June 1941.)</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: You mean after the Russians came into your city?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: About that same time.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: I learned that later.</span> <span id="s289">I didn’t know that much.</span> <span id="s290">I don’t remember what happened at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: OK, the Russians have moved in?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: Oh, people were saying that the Russians had taken part of Poland, a little part from their border (actually Russia annexed the eastern half of Poland in Sept. 1939, at the time they occupied the area of Romania between the Dnestr and the Prut rivers).</span> <span id="s293">Actually the problem which I am having is that they occupied a province of Romania.</span> <span id="s294">It was subdivided in north and south Bucovina.</span> <span id="s295">The Russians occupied the northern Bucovina, not the southern Bucovina and they occupied Bessarabia.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: What I was getting at before, about Poland was that I was wondering whether the Jewish community was aware of the Jewish people in Germany being deported to Poland (obviously deportation to Poland did not start until after Poland was dismembered which was when the Russians marched into Cernovcy and other areas given to it by the Treaty of Brest Litovsk in 1939.</span> <span id="s297">There had been one earlier attempt to dump Jews of Polish descent living in Germany into a no-man’s land in southeastern Poland which took place several weeks prior to the German invasion of Poland).</span> <span id="s298">I was wondering whether Romania had an influx of Romanian-German Jews being deported from Germany back into Romania.</span> <span id="s299">Did they experience that at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: Yes, we had some refugees from Poland.</span> <span id="s301">Later on a lot of refugees came from Poland (that must have been as the Jews were running from the NAZI invaders after the Russians had marched into Cernovcy.</span> <span id="s302">Prior to that the Romanians with their “Iron Guard” were a little more benevolent to the Jews than the NAZI’s).</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: None of them were Romanian Germans that they would just pick up and get rid of?</span> <span id="s304">Kicked out of Germany into Romania?</span> <span id="s305">You were not aware of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: No, no, no Germans!</span> <span id="s307">No, we didn’t get any Germans, just Polish refugees.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: Was there a receiving station with accommodations made for these refugees?</span> <span id="s309">Within the Jewish community of the city?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: I don’t know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: These may be questions that you have no way of answering.</span> <span id="s312">I was just wondering, kind of picking your brain a little on the subject.</span> <span id="s313">In 1940 the Russians had moved in and now how is this changing your personal life?</span> <span id="s314">You are 9 years old, going to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: It changed quite drastically, because we had to move from the apartment where we were to smaller apartment and my father was working in a different area and my schooling suddenly started in Russian.</span> <span id="s316">Yes, they were not considerate about what the population was speaking or what their background was; from then on it was Russia (to forcibly get the people to use Russian was considered the surest way to incorporate the Moldavian Socialist Republic into the USSR).</span> <span id="s317">There were a lot of things happening at that time.</span> <span id="s318">You could hear about the hardship of people who were affected; they had to move and they had to leave a lot of things behind.</span> <span id="s319">During that period I continued with my schooling in the Russian language.</span> <span id="s320">I learned some Russian.</span> <span id="s321">it was only in the later part of that year, just before the war with the Germans broke out, that they started a real terror campaign.</span> <span id="s322">This terror campaign was not in the sense of killing anybody.</span> <span id="s323">They would come in the middle of the night and tried to evacuate people out of their homes into different areas of the country than where they were living.</span> <span id="s324">The rumor was they they were going to interchange the entire population.</span> <span id="s325">They were going to move the whole population out little by little and bring new people in from deep in the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s326">That is how they were going to make it a Russian place.</span> <span id="s327">So everyone was terrorized by that.</span> <span id="s328">You didn’t know when they were coming.</span> <span id="s329">Usually the police came at 2:00 a.m.</span> <span id="s330">They knocked at the door and said, “You are under arrest and you have to leave with us right away!</span> <span id="s331">Take only what you can pick up.”</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: Can I ask you whether this was directed toward the Jewish community, or against the city in general?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: No, no!</span> <span id="s334">That was against the city in general.</span> <span id="s335">That is one thing I must tell you.</span> <span id="s336">The Russians were not discriminating on the basis of anything about religion, language, sex or national origin, only about political affiliation and about your background, as far as whether you were educated, had some wealth, had some employees working for you, or you were just a simple worker yourself all your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: Now please explain the difference it would make to them whether you were a businessman or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: They, at first, started saying, “Those who employed other people were exploiting the people and therefore had a low social standing and should get lower jobs and should not be trusted as much.”</span> <span id="s339">Then they wanted to set everybody against everybody else.</span> <span id="s340">They indoctrinated children in the politics of the state.</span> <span id="s341">They said that you should denounce anybody whom you had heard make statements against the state, including your own parents.</span> <span id="s342">They had spies in every building.</span> <span id="s343">I mean people who were informers.</span> <span id="s344">You had to watch who you talked to about what, what you said to whom.</span> <span id="s345">People were disappearing overnight, being sent to prison because of something they had said.</span> <span id="s346">There was a general recognition that if you were a businessman, no matter how small a businessman, or if you had your own drugstore or whatever, you had been in the ruling classes.</span> <span id="s347">If you had been a laborer some place, then you were a little safer from being sent away.</span> <span id="s348">Rumors had it that first they were going to send those people who had some wealth or education away, but that eventually they were going to send everybody away.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: Now basically you were moved from a large apartment to a smaller apartment first.</span> <span id="s350">I was curious about the fact that you were saying that your father had changed jobs.</span> <span id="s351">Was it mandatory that everybody worked?</span> <span id="s352">Was it a case where they insisted that he would find work or was he just lucky enough to find something?</span> <span id="s353">(In 1939-40 jobs in the US were not yet plentiful.)</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A: In the central society they said that who works eats, who doesn’t work doesn’t eat.</span> <span id="s355">That is all there was to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: But there was no discrimination against keeping people from getting jobs.</span> <span id="s357">In other words, if they were of the “exploiter class,” which your father, being an owner of a business was, they did not select him out and say, “you cannot work.”</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: They would not give him a supervisory position.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: But he was not held back as far as getting a job, any job?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: OK, that is what I tried to determine.</span> <span id="s362">I was just wondering how they acted toward these people.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: Oh no, they were smarter than that.</span> <span id="s364">They wouldn’t take somebody and not let them work because they needed workers.</span> <span id="s365">If you did anything it was for the good of the state.</span> <span id="s366">If you don’t do anything you don’t have any usefulness.</span> <span id="s367">They were not stupid, I can tell you.</span> <span id="s368">This cannot be said about the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: I am finding out while we are talking, that their techniques are quite different from what the Germans had as techniques.</span> <span id="s370">That is why my questions sound a little naive, maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: I know that they were stupid, at least that is what we thought.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: Did you think the Russians were stupid?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: Oh no, not the Russians, the Germans.</span> <span id="s374">Incidentally, this is a concept which exists in Austria and has existed for centuries, that the Germans are not as smart as Austrians.</span> <span id="s375">The Germans are very straight forward and don’t know anything about any negotiations or looking at all the possibilities.</span> <span id="s376">They are only straight forward.</span> <span id="s377">They are the type who would march, if you tell them to, all march into the water, they would march into the water because you told them so.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: The Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: That’s interesting.</span> <span id="s381">OK!</span> <span id="s382">I’d like you to go on now and tell what happened in the time period after you had been moved.</span> <span id="s383">Had your family been terrorized in the middle of the night and moved out of the city?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: No.</span> <span id="s385">No we had not, we had not been touched.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: Now how much time had elapsed?</span> <span id="s387">And what has taken place after your father had taken up his new job and you were living in the smaller apartment?</span> <span id="s388">You were still going to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: I was going to school.</span> <span id="s390">Just the regular way of life.</span> <span id="s391">We didn’t have any shortages as I remember, no shortages of any kind.</span> <span id="s392">We continued the same life.</span> <span id="s393">There were just the rumors, which I talked about, rumors about the future.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: How long did it take before something did take place?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: Until the war.</span> <span id="s396">Eleven months.</span> <span id="s397">(So this must have been happening in July of 1940, to make the timing fit.)</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: Then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: After eleven months, which was June of 1941, we were woken up in the middle of the night, rather in the early morning, about 4 or 5 o’clock, by sirens and we heard shooting and bombings.</span> <span id="s400">We had been bombed by German airplanes.</span> <span id="s401">Within 24 or 48 hours, we saw a lot of Soviet troops running and hurrying across, moving back.</span> <span id="s402">The Germans had attacked in a lightning fashion (the famous “Blitzkrieg” moving like a thunderstorm) and the Russians were fully in retreat.</span> <span id="s403">The Germans, once ina while, came over with planes and bombed.</span> <span id="s404">They tried to bomb the railroad station.</span> <span id="s405">I was there, visiting with a friend and I got scared because it was in the middle of a bombing, but we were still looking out to see what happened.</span> <span id="s406">You see those little black puffs of ack-ack, the anti-aircraft guns.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: Now what was happening with the people in the city?</span> <span id="s408">I imagine chaos.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s410">They did not come after the population.</span> <span id="s411">As I said they came with very few planes, they did not come in mass.</span> <span id="s412">That was an American characteristic (actually the main airplane raids were concentrated in the north on the main invasion road to Vilnius-Leningrad and Smolensk-Moskow) of mass bombing.</span> <span id="s413">They came with a few planes and looked for strategic targets, like railroad stations or a bridge.</span> <span id="s414">There were a lot of sirens and the people did not get that panicky.</span> <span id="s415">You were supposed to go into shelters when the sirens gave you the warning, but many people, you know, didn’t do it.</span> <span id="s416">We were kids, we just liked to look up outside.</span> <span id="s417">There were short raids and I heard them say that the Russians had those double winged planes (biplanes had been the most common planes in the early 1930’s) which they called “Kokurusniks,” which means like corn, like cornplanes.</span> <span id="s418">One shot the other one up because they didn’t know much.</span> <span id="s419">They weren’t very good.</span> <span id="s420">They didn’t know what they were doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: How many troops are you talking about, as far as the Russians were concerned?</span> <span id="s422">How large a contingent of troops were there in the area?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: Ground troops?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s425">Do you have any idea how many were there?</span> <span id="s426">At the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: I have no idea, but they had large masses of troops.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: The Germans were shooting them?</span> <span id="s429">Shooting at the Russian troops?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: As far as I know they just declared war and the Russians started running.</span> <span id="s431">The front collapsed because it was manned by a large contingent of Ukrainian troops.</span> <span id="s432">The Ukraine is a large part of Russia, you know, of western Russia.</span> <span id="s433">They didn’t have their loyalty for the Soviet Union, they thought they were going to surrender right away.</span> <span id="s434">So, many of them surrendered and they left no one to defend the borders, and the Germans just walked through.</span> <span id="s435">There wasn’t a lot of shooting at all.</span> <span id="s436">They just marched straight through.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: So they came in and took over the town, I assume?</span> <span id="s438">All right.</span> <span id="s439">What changes took place at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: At that point, there were a lot of changes, because at that point everybody got really disturbed.</span> <span id="s441">There was really a tremendous upheaval and panic, because those people who first received the Russians well were now declared by other people to be Communists and that they ought to be shot, because first they were with the enemy and then they had to prove some loyalty to the new conquerors.</span> <span id="s442">There was anarchy.</span> <span id="s443">The Romanians were not there, the Russians were not there, there was just the German army, who was passing through and they had no interest in the population.</span> <span id="s444">They were going after the Russians.</span> <span id="s445">There was no low or order, so you had a lot of people just doing what they wanted to.</span> <span id="s446">There were a lot of killings and arbitrary shootings, between enemies, also between the people.</span> <span id="s447">Some came and looked their employers up, if they had not been happy with their employers, they tried to kill them.</span> <span id="s448">There were robbings.</span> <span id="s449">There just was no order.</span> <span id="s450">There was no authority.</span> <span id="s451">In the first few days, the Germans just went through, after the Russians.</span> <span id="s452">The Romanian army had not come back yet, or if they did, they did not have enough time - or inclination - to establish any kind of law.</span> <span id="s453">I remember that at that time, one old employee of my father’s came to our house and wanted to interrogate him about a gun which my father used to have, that he knew about.</span> <span id="s454">That was a hand gun.</span> <span id="s455">He came with a policeman, or something like that, whom he had found someplace.</span> <span id="s456">My parents got scared and shoved me over to a neighbors, after all we lived in an apartment, so that I would be protected in case this guy would kill them.</span> <span id="s457">I don’t know what happened.</span> <span id="s458">They talked a l ot.</span> <span id="s459">They didn’t do any violence, or didn’t rob or anything.</span> <span id="s460">In this way we were lucky.</span> <span id="s461">In some places people got killed that way.</span> <span id="s462">Not a whole lot of people got killed.</span> <span id="s463">There were a few days of real anarchy.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: Considering the fact that the Germans had moved in, do you recall the reaction of the Jewish community or of your own family.</span> <span id="s465">That was quite a thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: Oh yes!</span> <span id="s467">There was panic among a lot of the people.</span> <span id="s468">As I have said, Jewish people were panicky.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: Was there a case where people tried to just vacate the area, to leave, to migrate to anywhere?</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: Oh, there was no place to go to.</span> <span id="s471">I remember that my parents were considering leaving before the war in 1936, 1937, or so.</span> <span id="s472">They were discussing it, because my father had an uncle and some brothers and sisters in the Americas.</span> <span id="s473">He had a brother and a sister in Brazil.</span> <span id="s474">He had a brother in the US.</span> <span id="s475">He had cousins in other countries in South America.</span> <span id="s476">In Ecuador, where we finally went.</span> <span id="s477">He did not want to leave his business.</span> <span id="s478">He didn’t think that it was going to be that serious.</span> <span id="s479">He felt that he had what he needed there.</span> <span id="s480">When this happened, there was no place to go.</span> <span id="s481">Nobody wanted to run with the Russians, except maybe some of the Communist leaders of the party, or something like that.</span> <span id="s482">There was practically no one whom I know who went with the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: Had there been in the community of the city itself, the Jewish community, different people migrating over those years, people that you know of?</span> <span id="s484">An exodus of any sort?</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: You mean migrating out of the city?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: Yes, migrating out of the city.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: Were they leaving (Europe).</span> <span id="s489">Even though your father had thought of it and didn’t go, there were Jewish people who were leaving Romania?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s491">As I was saying that area was very prosperous as a center of trade before WWI and after that it became very depressed.</span> <span id="s492">The depression was due to the loss of all that trade it no longer was an open door from the Ukraine to Vienna and the rest of Central Europe) and industry and also because they did not want to serve in the Romanian army, that is the young men, so they left for the US, or other parts in the West.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: OK, the German military have passed through the city, following the Russians with anarchy reigning for about 2 to 3 days.</span> <span id="s494">What took place at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: They reestablished the Romanian rule (Romanian soldiers were fighting the Russians alongside the Germans).</span> <span id="s496">They declared right away that the Jews had lost all their civil rights, and established the ghetto.</span> <span id="s497">This meant that a small section of the city was set aside and all the Jews had to live there.</span> <span id="s498">They just had to, they could not live anywhere else; if they did they would be immediately arrested and prosecuted, possibly shot.</span> <span id="s499">The Jews had to wear a yellow star (the sizes of these yellow stars to be worn on one’s outside garment, and their location, was fixed by law).</span> <span id="s500">Jews could not go out at night.</span> <span id="s501">There was a curfew for Jews.</span> <span id="s502">We had to leave our apartment and go and live with an aunt of mine who lived in that ghetto area.</span> <span id="s503">In that way several families were crowded together.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: Can I ask you this, a very personal question, what were your feelings at that time about what was happening to Jewish people.</span> <span id="s505">Do you have any really strong feelings about why the Jewish community was singled out?</span> <span id="s506">Did you, as a young child, realize what was happening and why was it happening to you as a people as opposed to, shall we say, some other people?</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: As a child I didn’t, but later on I did.</span> <span id="s508">At this point I did not think too much about it, actually not at all at this point, in that context, however, I did later when I was for 4 years in the Ukraine under constant peril of being exterminated.</span> <span id="s509">I had the knowledge that they wanted to exterminate the Jews, then.</span> <span id="s510">However, at that point we are talking about in 1941, we were with the entire family (except for those who lived abroad) in an area which was politically in a great upheaval.</span> <span id="s511">They claimed that they were treating us that way and we did not know for sure whether it was like that just there, or whether it was like that everywhere.</span> <span id="s512">We thought it was like that just in that area because we were under the Russians for a year, and that they suspected us of being Communists and now that the NAZI’s were there they had certain things to counteract or kind of sterilize the area.</span> <span id="s513">We thought that we were being punished for what had happened a year before (it had happened as a result of the pact between the Germans and the Russians).</span> <span id="s514">We did not realize how extensive that policy was at that moment, or what it meant.</span> <span id="s515">We were still, as I said, with all our family together.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: Was your father still working?</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: No!</span> <span id="s518">Not after the Germans came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: Now the ghetto was established.</span> <span id="s520">I assume that at this point shortages became paramount in your existences.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: I don’t remember any shortages.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: That is interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: I still don’t remember any.</span> <span id="s524">We had very adequately things to eat and everything.</span> <span id="s525">They were much more humane than they were in other places.</span> <span id="s526">I remember that one of my aunts who had her husband’s mother, who was a senior citizen, they did not have to leave to move into the ghetto, because of extenuating circumstances.</span> <span id="s527">They said that if you had a senior citizen, or someone who was crippled or some other type of handicapped people, you could stay where you are, if moving into the ghetto would prove to be a great hardship.</span> <span id="s528">So they remained in their apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: Did they take any of the Jewish community leaders?</span> <span id="s530">Anyone with any influence within the community out.</span> <span id="s531">In other words, was the Jewish community left intact?</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: I doubt it.</span> <span id="s533">They treated everybody like members of one mass.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: Did you attend school?</span> <span id="s535">I realize it was summertime when the Germans moved in.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: Not after the Germans came, the NAZI’s came in.</span> <span id="s537">However, we continued to get some instruction in Hebrew from the Rabbis we had access to.</span> <span id="s538">That was religious training.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: How big of a community are we talking about?</span> <span id="s540">How big was the ghetto?</span> <span id="s541">How many people were in it?</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: There were a lot of people in a very small area.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: How large a population?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: About 60,000.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: Can you tell me what takes place.</span> <span id="s546">The sequence of events following this?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: That was a very short period that we were there and maybe that is why we didn’t have shortages.</span> <span id="s548">It was only a period of 2 weeks.</span> <span id="s549">It was a tremendous upheaval and everybody was very upset and concerned.</span> <span id="s550">Nobody worked and there were no normal functions of any kind.</span> <span id="s551">They put out a decree to put to rest all rumors that because Romania had lost this province here to Russia, the people had to go to Russia.</span> <span id="s552">So they brought in railroad trains and filled the cars up with a lot of people and then locked the doors after telling us we were going to paradise.</span> <span id="s553">Then they sent us to the East, into Russia proper.</span> <span id="s554">Then they unloaded us.</span> <span id="s555">The train was full of people.</span> <span id="s556">I think that they must have forced people to board the train.</span> <span id="s557">I don’t remember that very clearly.</span> <span id="s558">Anyway they really filled those box cars up.</span> <span id="s559">We traveled all night long.</span> <span id="s560">We didn’t know where we were going.</span> <span id="s561">They never opened the doors while we were traveling.</span> <span id="s562">When they opened the doors, we were at the border of the river.</span> <span id="s563">It was a big river, the Dnestr River, like the Ohio River; well not as big as the Ohio, but almost.</span> <span id="s564">It was a bad time of the year to cross the river, the river had flooded shortly before and it was muddy all over.</span> <span id="s565">There were just soldiers with guns and they yelled at everybody to get out and started beating people over the head, if they were slow.</span> <span id="s566">People just got out and carried something, then they started herding us on foot, to a bridge and they wanted to herd us across.</span> <span id="s567">On the other side was the Ukraine and Russia.</span> <span id="s568">So they were herding us across.</span> <span id="s569">I forgot to mention one interesting thing; which is now in my mind, a thing which I remember very vividly.</span> <span id="s570">When the Russians were there (in Cernovcy) and the war just broke out, the next day after the bombing, they said that everybody had to bring their electronic equipment, that is radios and any other electronic equipment to the Central Post Office.</span> <span id="s571">That was a huge building with cathedral ceilings, several stories high, like the Capitol.</span> <span id="s572">It looked very huge to me, but maybe it wasn’t like the Capitol.</span> <span id="s573">Everybody from the whole city had to bring it there.</span> <span id="s574">If you were caught with a radio afterwards, after that date, you were considered being a spy, that you were using it for transmission of military information, and you would be shot on the spot.</span> <span id="s575">That was already military rule.</span> <span id="s576">So I remember bringing in, with my father, that radio which was almost as huge as this TV set.</span> <span id="s577">It was a Horniphone, a German manufactured radio.</span> <span id="s578">That room was full of beautiful radios.</span> <span id="s579">They closed the room up and set it on fire, and burned the entire place down completely.</span> <span id="s580">I remember that.</span> <span id="s581">The Russians tried to destroy as much as they could before they left an area, so that there would not be anything left for the enemy to take advantage of.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: I wonder if it ever occurred to you, to your family and to the other people, who were being herded in these box cars to go to the East, were you aware of the concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: Oh yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: Did it not occur to the people that they might be going to a concentration camp, rather than to this, so called paradise?</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: Yes, they were just saying that but nobody believed that.</span> <span id="s586">We thought we were going to the concentration camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s588">You were saying that it occurred to you that they were not telling the truth?</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: Yes, everybody thought we were going to get killed, or put in a concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: Do you recall your own personal feelings at that time, as a young 10 year old boy?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s592">You have the feelings.</span> <span id="s593">It is a very, very strong feeling of wishing to live, of hoping to live, of being totally revulsed by the attitude that, because of no fault of your own, just because you were born in a certain type of family, or time period, you were not permitted your life.</span> <span id="s594">There also was a total, tremendous desire to be able to escape and live.</span> <span id="s595">The whole unfairness of it appeared unbelievable to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: Did anyone actually try to escape?</span> <span id="s597">Did they find any means of escaping?</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s599">I was actually going to say that.</span> <span id="s600">People were very aware of everything and cared and tried to do whatever they could.</span> <span id="s601">There were rumors going around, that once we got on the other side of the Dniestr River, we would be killed.</span> <span id="s602">Actually they told us that all the Jewish population in the Ukraine had been exterminated, and that was true.</span> <span id="s603">When the Germans came to the Ukraine everybody (meaning all the Jews) there was herded together and immediately destroyed, if they hadn’t previously escaped.</span> <span id="s604">Many of the Jews escaped earlier with the Russian troops.</span> <span id="s605">We found no Jewish population in the Ukraine.</span> <span id="s606">Anyway we were going through this muddy, rainy, soaking wet place, where we couldn’t even sit down without getting soaked in the mud, with all our bundles.</span> <span id="s607">We dragged it all with us.</span> <span id="s608">We were very, very tired.</span> <span id="s609">You know half a day, going across that bridge was a lot.</span> <span id="s610">There was a town on the other side, a good-sized town called Mogilev (Mogilev-Podolski is located 48.27N, 27.48E).</span> <span id="s611">The town was being flooded.</span> <span id="s612">It was pretty close to the river so a lot of it was flooded (the transcriber seems to remember that the Russians opened or blew up some dams in order to gain some time for their retreat).</span> <span id="s613">They kept herding us on the streets and some people ran away.</span> <span id="s614">I ran away with my father and my uncle and my cousin.</span> <span id="s615">At one moment we abandoned the column when they were not watching us.</span> <span id="s616">We ran into a house which stood abandoned, empty and flooded.</span> <span id="s617">There was just mud inside.</span> <span id="s618">I remember my father finding someplace some boards.</span> <span id="s619">He put the boards down in the mud and I lay down and I actually slept.</span> <span id="s620">I didn’t know what happened after that.</span> <span id="s621">They were all discussing in a very upset way, in a very distressed way, about finding my mother and the other girls.</span> <span id="s622">They had separated us.</span> <span id="s623">They were going out to some kind of military camp.</span> <span id="s624">There, they lost each other and then they found each other.</span> <span id="s625">It was a whole nightmare of stories.</span> <span id="s626">They finally escaped from there.</span> <span id="s627">In the meantime, we didn’t know where they were, we had gotten separated and we had gotten hold of that abandoned house and flooded out.</span> <span id="s628">We stayed in there.</span> <span id="s629">It took a couple of days, until we got reunited with the rest of the family.</span> <span id="s630">I understand that somewhere they marched the rest of the people somewhere even farther in the interior and I believe they were killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q: OK, then you, your father, your uncle and your cousin, the 3 of you, or 4 of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s632">A: No, there was just one of my cousins, and me; there were just 2 of us.</span> <span id="s633">My cousin was a boy.</span> <span id="s634">I also had a girl cousin, the boy’s sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Q: But there were just some males who had darted into this house?</span></p> <p><span id="s636">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Q: When you say “you slept,” you mean that you fell asleep.</span> <span id="s638">Your dad got the boards and you lay down on them and you fell asleep.</span> <span id="s639">Now this column, I am assuming at the same time continued to move down the road.</span> <span id="s640">Do you have any idea whether your father had been able to talk this over with your mother or was it an instantaneous type of thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: It was just instinct (the instinct of self-preservation).</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: OK!</span> <span id="s643">The mother and the other women including the cousins, had gone on with the column.</span> <span id="s644">Now, you say that they went to some central area, the military camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: Yes, to a huge building, which had been empty like a military garrison type of a building.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: How far away from you, did they end up, at that building?</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: Apparently, it was on the outskirts of the city.</span> <span id="s648">It was a good distance away, one mile, maybe 2 miles away.</span> <span id="s649">I don’t really know.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: Everyone had apparently gone away with the 4 of you in this empty house.</span> <span id="s651">I am sure that it was rather chaotic to decide what to do at this point.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: It was.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: Did you try to get back with the group, or did you try to stay away from them.</span> <span id="s654">You were torn away between the two.</span> <span id="s655">Can you tell me, you just mentioned briefly, what you thought?</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: Well, the feeling was that eventually everyone would escape and get together.</span> <span id="s657">There was no question of going back to the group.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: Oh, I see.</span> <span id="s659">Your mother apparently was aware that this escape had taken place, in other words, she saw that you had gotten away?</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: No.</span> <span id="s661">The men and the women were all separated.</span> <span id="s662">She and her sister and one niece got separated also, because they had trouble.</span> <span id="s663">They told a whole long story, which I don’t even remember very well.</span> <span id="s664">How they found each other; they told each other, when they were just alone and others didn’t know where they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: Did they know where you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: No!</span> <span id="s667">No!</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: They had no idea exactly what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: How then did you get back together?</span> <span id="s671">How did this take place?</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: That is one of the difficult things.</span> <span id="s673">I don’t remember exactly, although my cousin had told the story several times.</span> <span id="s674">It is very long.</span> <span id="s675">I don’t remember how, but they found each other.</span> <span id="s676">They talked with other people, with people they knew and they said “I saw your husband, or wife over there.”</span> <span id="s677">It was apparently a huge building, or group of buildings where they wound up.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: What I was basically asking was: “how did you, your small group, get back together?”</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: We got together.</span> <span id="s680">They came to that house.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: How?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s683">I can’t remember.</span> <span id="s684">I really don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: However, basically, when you were there, at this particular time, were you free to roam?</span> <span id="s686">Were the women also free?</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: The town was composed of many people, I mean people who lived there, and you could get lost in a town, at least, that is what we thought.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: And the women, your mother and cousin and all were able to leave the group?</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: Yes, somehow they were able to leave also.</span> <span id="s690">Then somehow they found us.</span> <span id="s691">they were looking for us, I guess, backtracking to the edges of the road to see when we might have escaped.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: That must have been quite a long ordeal?</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: It was.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: OK, how many of you were there in this house?</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: Oh, there was someone else there also.</span> <span id="s696">There was my family and my aunt’s family and my uncle’s brother’s family.</span> <span id="s697">They were all there.</span> <span id="s698">There were 3 or 4 families in that house.</span> <span id="s699">There was nothing in that house, just mud.</span> <span id="s700">So we were there for a while and then we started looking for a house to rent in the city.</span> <span id="s701">They limited us to a ghetto again; to a section of the town.</span> <span id="s702">Now this was under Romanian control now, in the city of Mogilev.</span> <span id="s703">However, the city was full of Ukrainian population, the people were Greek-Orthodox.</span> <span id="s704">They had been in the Soviet Union before, right on the border (on the east shore of the Dnestr).</span> <span id="s705">Many of the Ukrainians had escaped with the Russian army and then surrendered to the Germans.</span> <span id="s706">Somehow we rented a house where we could stay.</span> <span id="s707">It was a small little house which had a mud floor.</span> <span id="s708">They refinished the floor maybe once or twice a year.</span> <span id="s709">That was the Ukrainian style.</span> <span id="s710">You had to take mud and dampen it and straw and mix it up and dry it out in the sun and then finish it up on the floor.</span> <span id="s711">That was the floor.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: What kind of huts were these?</span> <span id="s713">Were they any kind of straw huts?</span> <span id="s714">In the whole basic construction?</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: No!</span> <span id="s716">The floor was.</span> <span id="s717">It was a brick building.</span> <span id="s718">The floor was mud.</span> <span id="s719">I don’t remember what the roof was.</span> <span id="s720">The people lived very primitively there in the Ukraine.</span> <span id="s721">I bet that they still must be living that way, now.</span> <span id="s722">However, they were nice people and we lived between the Ukrainian people.</span> <span id="s723">We had brought very little with us, but for some reason my family was smart enough to survive.</span> <span id="s724">They took their jewelry, including diamonds or gold or whatever.</span> <span id="s725">They opened up the silver knives.</span> <span id="s726">The handles came apart if you melted them down and hid them there, then they sealed it.</span> <span id="s727">So with all the knives, they had some jewelry left.</span> <span id="s728">The could barter that for groceries with the Ukrainian peasants.</span> <span id="s729">They were trading it by the sack, such as a sack of potatoes or flour.</span> <span id="s730">From that you had to make your own bread by mixing it up and letting it rise and then putting it into the oven.</span> <span id="s731">Neighbors would not mind because they - I don’t know if you know the Russian ovens?</span> <span id="s732">They are solid brick and very large like this (obviously making some hand signals).</span> <span id="s733">They make a fire in them and it gets very hot, after burning for several hours.</span> <span id="s734">Then you put out the fire and put the bread in.</span> <span id="s735">The heat is still there and that will bake the bread - had the advantage of hot bricks to get started for the next baking cycle.</span> <span id="s736">So we baked in these ovens also; we baked bread for a while.</span> <span id="s737">We had varied foods.</span> <span id="s738">We ate potatoes and maybe bread.</span> <span id="s739">We bought pig’s fat, lard from the farmers, it was like bacon except that there was no meat on it.</span> <span id="s740">That is what we were eating.</span> <span id="s741">We also ate corn baked into cornbread or mush (the corn which was grown in Europe prior to the end of WWII was suitable only for animal feeding, not for human consumption).</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: You briefly mentioned that the people (with) whom you moved in were Greek Orthodox, and were very nice.</span> <span id="s743">I assume then that they were very receptive to you.</span> <span id="s744">Were you, as a Jewish community, well received by this group, on the whole, or did you happen to personally, as a family to be lucky?</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: Oh, yes, it was person to person.</span> <span id="s746">There was nothing organized about it.</span> <span id="s747">They were not asked, whether people can come in.</span> <span id="s748">They were a people who were used to be occupied.</span> <span id="s749">They had been an occupied people for many generations.</span> <span id="s750">They didn’t want the Russians at all.</span> <span id="s751">They wanted them out.</span> <span id="s752">However, they knew that they couldn’t get them out.</span> <span id="s753">They were, like the Poles, kind of hateful people; very tragic people in their history (their country had often been a battleground including battles between the Russians and the Turks).</span> <span id="s754">They were antagonistic to us but they were a different type of people than we had known.</span> <span id="s755">Some of them would never look at you and others may take pity on you, or something.</span> <span id="s756">I know that our neighbors had boys my age whom I got to be very good friends with.</span> <span id="s757">We went to the horses and I helped them in the fields.</span> <span id="s758">I went to the river with them.</span> <span id="s759">I had a fairly good time.</span> <span id="s760">I went skiing with them in the winter.</span> <span id="s761">Of course, we were on boards, not on skis.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: You were still being identified as Jewish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: With the star?</span></p> <p><span id="s765">A: Yes, you had to do that.</span> <span id="s766">You had to do that.</span> <span id="s767">They were poor, also, and they were suffering from poverty.</span> <span id="s768">We had an outhouse.</span> <span id="s769">Four families lived in one house, practically in one room.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: Were the men able to find work?</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: No!</span> <span id="s772">There wasn’t any work.</span> <span id="s773">Later they were taken to work for free, as slave labor, on the bridge.</span> <span id="s774">They didn’t get anything for it.</span> <span id="s775">They had to do that.</span> <span id="s776">Later on there was a lot of typhus and malnutrition.</span> <span id="s777">People died of that.</span> <span id="s778">There were very few violent deaths.</span> <span id="s779">The Romanians did not, as far as I know, do any mass killing (this area of the Ukraine was administered by the Romanians for the Germans) or mass destruction.</span> <span id="s780">They mostly left people alone.</span> <span id="s781">They took some people to work on the bridges, the Germans did.</span> <span id="s782">However, the people who died, died of malnutrition or diseases.</span> <span id="s783">That is the way it was until one day, during the third summer, they rounded us up and took us 12 miles inland to a military garrison called Skassinets.</span> <span id="s784">They herded a lot of people there and kept us there for 3 months.</span> <span id="s785">That was really bad.</span> <span id="s786">There was hunger there.</span> <span id="s787">Again we could barter with the peasants who were going by and obtain stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Q: You must have said how long you were in this original Romanian community, before you were moved.</span> <span id="s789">How long were you among the Greek Orthodox in the Ukrainian community?</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: This was all part of the Ukraine.</span> <span id="s791">The whole country was Ukraine!</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: I meant in this area.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">A: That is the whole country!</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q: I realize that, but in this particular community.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: You mean in the city?</span> <span id="s796">In the city of Mogilev?</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A: That was a big city.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: How long were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A: We were in that city for the entire period of time, except for that third summer, for three months, we were taken away from the city to Skassinet (transcriber is not quite certain that this is the correct spelling for this place, which is located 12 miles from Mogilev).</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s802">I was assuming that they were moving you all out and further inland.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">A: No, we stayed there all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Q: Was there any attempt made to establish any kind of school at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: I was given instruction in Hebrew and in Bible and other religious instruction (FG’s 13th birthday was coming up, the time for the Bar Mitzvah of the Jewish boy).</span> <span id="s806">I learned a lot of Hebrew.</span> <span id="s807">There was a Rabbi living in the housing area, a young couple.</span> <span id="s808">That couple was very young.</span> <span id="s809">They were really Orthodox.</span> <span id="s810">He knew a lot and he was trying to teach me.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q: But there was no attempt by the Romanians to establish any kind of school?</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: No!</span> <span id="s813">No, sir!</span> <span id="s814">They had nothing!</span> <span id="s815">They had nothing!</span> <span id="s816">There was no school for anybody.</span> <span id="s817">It was war.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q: Was the war being fought in the area where you were at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s819">A: No.</span> <span id="s820">Further away (to the east and to the north).</span> <span id="s821">Much further away.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q: You were never bothered again by the Russian troops, or the German troops in that particular area where you were under the command of the Romanians?</span></p> <p><span id="s823">A: Not that I know consciously of, except that I remember, as I said, walking with a friend of mine.</span> <span id="s824">I came back walking with this friend of mine, a Ukrainian whose name was Bolotka Nadinia.</span> <span id="s825">I used to wear glasses when I was small.</span> <span id="s826">I used to be farsighted.</span> <span id="s827">We were bringing the horses back.</span> <span id="s828">Then a soldier called me over and said, “Let me see those glasses!”</span> <span id="s829">He dropped my glasses.</span> <span id="s830">I said, “I won’t be able to see!</span> <span id="s831">You have to give me back my glasses!</span> <span id="s832">Please give me back the glasses.”</span> <span id="s833">My friend also pleaded with him.</span> <span id="s834">So he gave me back my glasses.</span> <span id="s835">I had thought he was going to break them or something.</span> <span id="s836">He just gave me back my glasses.</span> <span id="s837">So, there were soldiers roaming around.</span> <span id="s838">We tried to avoid them.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q: Which soldiers were these now?</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A: There were both types, Germans and Romanians (after the Germans invaded Romania, that country became a satellite until the Russians occupied it in 1945).</span> <span id="s841">Romanians were patrolling.</span> <span id="s842">Germans were in columns moving through.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: OK, now you said that during the third summer, that you were in this particular city, you were moved out for 3 months.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: Yes, they moved us out for 3 months and we escaped from there.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: Ah!</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: Yes, they moved us into there (Skassinet) and that was really a bad camp.</span> <span id="s847">We were all crowded together in this huge, huge building.</span> <span id="s848">There was nothing.</span> <span id="s849">Just people and more people; masses of people like an overcrowded prison.</span> <span id="s850">It was surrounded by wire, that is barbed wire and soldiers.</span> <span id="s851">They were saying that they were going to kill us in there.</span> <span id="s852">So we decided that we were going to make our escape.</span> <span id="s853">My mother and I and 2 other ladies - I believe my aunt and my girl cousin - in the middle of the night we escaped out through the barbed wire.</span> <span id="s854">We went into hiding in the tall corn.</span> <span id="s855">It was in the middle of the summer.</span> <span id="s856">By hiding from clump of corn to clump of corn we walked back to Mogilev, trying not to be detected.</span> <span id="s857">At one time some peasants saw us and we thought that they were going to give us away for sure, but they didn’t.</span> <span id="s858">We kept hiding.</span> <span id="s859">We walked only during the night.</span> <span id="s860">Finally we made it back to the city.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q: Now how far a distance was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s862">A: Well, it is hard to say, maybe it was about 60 miles or something like that (earlier FG had talked about 12 miles, so an error exists somewhere).</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Q: Were you still wearing the identification (yellow star)?</span></p> <p><span id="s864">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">Q: Had it occurred to you, to your family, to discard the identification and blend in anyway.</span> <span id="s866">No one spoke the language well enough to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: No.</span> <span id="s868">(It was punishable by instant death to be caught not wearing the star, if you were Jewish, in any area under German control.)</span> <span id="s869">You could not blend in with the population.</span> <span id="s870">The population was quite different.</span> <span id="s871">They were a different nationality, different religion and social background.</span> <span id="s872">They were real peasants.</span> <span id="s873">They belonged in their village and their houses, you just couldn’t blend in.</span> <span id="s874">They had different clothes.</span> <span id="s875">They were wearing what you see in a museum of native clothing.</span> <span id="s876">You see some of their clothes when you see the native dances.</span> <span id="s877">That is what they wear, embroidered skirts and shirts.</span> <span id="s878">Just by looking at us they could see that we are a different people.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Q: Did you have to carry a passport, anything of that type?</span> <span id="s880">Identification papers?</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: We had thrown the identification papers away.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">Q: OK, you had returned to the city.</span> <span id="s883">Your father and uncle are still in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s884">A: They joined us later.</span> <span id="s885">Again, I don’t know how.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q: You don’t know how they ran away!</span> <span id="s887">Did you return to the house where you had been?</span></p> <p><span id="s888">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s889">To the same house.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Q: Were you not concerned that they would just come and pick you up and take you right back again?</span> <span id="s891">Or possibly even kill you for escaping?</span></p> <p><span id="s892">A: No, we were not.</span> <span id="s893">We were amongst a mass of people.</span> <span id="s894">I wish that I had my mother here so that I could ask her all these questions.</span> <span id="s895">Now that we are going through it, there is a lot which I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s896">Unfortunately, she passed away.</span> <span id="s897">My father’s memory is not acute enough to remember anything anymore about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">Q: You are doing very well considering how old you were at the time.</span> <span id="s899">There were many things about which you may not really have been aware of.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: Probably, if you had interviewed me 30 years ago, I would have been able to tell you a lot more.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">Q: I don’t think I would have been old enough to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">A: That’s right - you could not have done that.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s904">You have returned to the city.</span> <span id="s905">I was just thinking; would this be a good place to stop for tonight and maybe continue on at another time.</span> <span id="s906">There seems to still be quite a bit we have to talk about.</span> <span id="s907">Would you feel comfortable about doing that?</span></p> <p><span id="s908">A: If you like to, or if you would like to continue, I am not too tired.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">Q: OK, we decided to continue on, at this time.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">A: I don’t remember too much more about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q: You have returned to the house in Mogilev.</span> <span id="s912">I just wondered what took place after your return.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A: Well, we started to get pretty emaciated.</span> <span id="s914">I used to be a pretty chubby child always.</span> <span id="s915">I lost a lot of weight.</span> <span id="s916">The main thing is when you become under-nourished and lose protein, you become sensitive to infections.</span> <span id="s917">I remember getting boils which would not heal on my face.</span> <span id="s918">I still have some scars.</span> <span id="s919">These boils went on and on and on.</span> <span id="s920">I had other diseases, probably diphtheria or whatever it was.</span> <span id="s921">Then I overcome them.</span> <span id="s922">It got increasingly difficult to feed yourself.</span> <span id="s923">The last couple of years, or rather the last year, my father was taken away for slave labor and you never knew whether they would come back.</span> <span id="s924">Everybody lived with the certain knowledge that each day is just very precious because we knew that they were going to kill us.</span> <span id="s925">They intended to kill us.</span> <span id="s926">They just didn’t get around to it.</span> <span id="s927">We hoped that the allies would win the war and come to liberate us.</span> <span id="s928">We kept hoping.</span> <span id="s929">Some people just had had communications through radios, because we became aware when the US got into the war.</span> <span id="s930">There was a great celebration then.</span> <span id="s931">They were aware once in a while, of what was going on, on how the war was going on.</span> <span id="s932">We heard rumors about what was going on, about the battle of Stalingrad (Stalingrad now called Volgograd - 48.44N, 44.25E, on the river Volga was the battle in 1943, which marked the eastern most penetration of the German armies in WWII.</span> <span id="s933">After a stubborn Russian resistance and strong counter attack, the German army group under Marshall Von Paulus surrendered to the Russians with its weapons on Feb. 2, 1943).</span> <span id="s934">We were also aware of that maybe because of the local population.</span> <span id="s935">I know that my friend, Bolotka, he had a brother who was in his early twenties and was an officer in the Russian army.</span> <span id="s936">He came back in a German uniform to visit.</span> <span id="s937">He discarded the uniform and went into the forest as a partisan.</span> <span id="s938">Those were the guerrilla fighters (they played havoc with the German lines of supplies).</span> <span id="s939">In the beginning the Ukrainians were happy that the Germans attacked because they were against the Russians (the Ukrainian farmers had born the brunt of the forced collectivization of the farms in Russia during the 1930’s), they wanted to get rid of the Communists and the Soviets, but then, when they realized who the Germans were and they were not treated well, otherwise said they realized that the Germans were worse, they deserted the Germans.</span> <span id="s940">Then they became partisan or guerrilla fighters, warriors in the forest against the Germans.</span> <span id="s941">They sabotaged them and endangered their lives on a daily basis in order to fight the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q: How did they react to the Romanian administration?</span> <span id="s943">Since the Romanians were in charge of the area.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">A: Who?</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: I am basically talking about the city you were in, where you had established yourself and which you said was being administered by the Romanians as overlords over the Ukrainian population.</span> <span id="s946">How did they react to that particular period when the Romanians were in charge of them, or in charge of the city I would think?</span> <span id="s947">Do you have any idea?</span> <span id="s948">Obviously they hated the Russians and they hated the Germans worse.</span> <span id="s949">I was just wondering whether they transferred their hatred to the Romanians?</span></p> <p><span id="s950">A: It is unfortunate, but the way I would put that is: the Romanians were from a small country, they were trying to survive.</span> <span id="s951">They did it by following the Germans.</span> <span id="s952">Of course, the Germans turned on the Romanians also.</span> <span id="s953">The Romanians resented the Germans very much.</span> <span id="s954">When they came to a bridge, the Germans demanded that the Romanians step aside and wait for them to pass first.</span> <span id="s955">The Romanians were treated as second class citizens.</span> <span id="s956">They did not have the power to be a very effective administration.</span> <span id="s957">I don’t know if they made too many waves there.</span> <span id="s958">The Ukrainians, basically, felt that they were being occupied and, as I said, they started fighting increasingly in numbers of people against the troops.</span> <span id="s959">The civilians just lived and minded their own business.</span> <span id="s960">They worked in the fields and they cared for their horses.</span> <span id="s961">They just tried to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: You said at one point that your father had been “taken away for slave labor.”</span> <span id="s963">Do you know anything about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A: He had to go everyday to work on the bridge and do heavy labor.</span> <span id="s965">He got very little food, just some soup.</span> <span id="s966">Then, in the evening, they were sent home.</span> <span id="s967">They were glad to have survived another day.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">Q: Now this was when you were living in the city of Mogilev?</span></p> <p><span id="s969">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">Q: When he had been moved inland, during that new camp, during the summer.</span> <span id="s971">(it must have been 1944.)</span></p> <p><span id="s972">A: There was nothing there.</span> <span id="s973">People were on top of each other, just sitting there.</span> <span id="s974">(by that time it must have been obvious to anyone in authority that the “NAZI’s thousand year Reich” was crumbling)</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: I thought that from there they had sent gangs into slavery.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: Maybe he worked there also.</span> <span id="s977">(It was from there that FG and his 3 female relatives escaped by crawling through the barbed wire.)</span> <span id="s978">He might have, I think that he might have.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Q: How long was it before he was able to rejoin you?</span></p> <p><span id="s980">A: That is right, he was taken in and out with a labor group everyday and brought back and they escaped from a labor group, also to the city.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">Q: Can I ask you something about an item which seems rather interesting.</span> <span id="s982">A family which is able to escape and reunite, then escape again and reunite again; was this unusual?</span> <span id="s983">Were people, families commonly able to do this as a routine thing, or was your family exceptional?</span></p> <p><span id="s984">A: That is a good question.</span> <span id="s985">I never even thought about it.</span> <span id="s986">However, I think that it was the usual thing there, because the Romanians were taking them and I don’t think that they were shooting anybody.</span> <span id="s987">People escaped.</span> <span id="s988">I didn’t hear of anybody being killed.</span> <span id="s989">I heard of people getting sick enough and die because of the typhus, which was rampant and epidemic because of lice and fleas.</span> <span id="s990">We had fleas.</span> <span id="s991">We had to look all the time for the fleas.</span> <span id="s992">There were very difficult living conditions.</span> <span id="s993">However, there were not Germans administering that - there were the Romanians.</span> <span id="s994">They were really not guarding the people like you do in a prison, or like the Germans did in their extermination camps.</span> <span id="s995">They kind of took it easy and people who wanted to escape, they escaped.</span> <span id="s996">It was a common thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">Q: When your family had been reunited in that city, living in that house again, you said before that they survived on the wealth which they had brought with them, primarily.</span> <span id="s998">Now, how long could that wealth last, or how long did it last?</span> <span id="s999">Then what?</span> <span id="s1000">How were you able to feed such a large group of people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">A: There was always some bartering going along.</span> <span id="s1002">A piece of clothing, whatever, could be used.</span> <span id="s1003">The Ukrainians were very, very poor, not because they didn’t have wealth like the land (the Ukraine used to be known as the bread basket of Russia, prior to the period of Stalin) and food and their own products.</span> <span id="s1004">They had no material nor industrial things because they had been under the Soviet rule before the war.</span> <span id="s1005">They had no consumer goods.</span> <span id="s1006">As far as they were concerned, we, in Romania were a Western country, so to speak.</span> <span id="s1007">Whatever we had was new to them.</span> <span id="s1008">They just didn’t have these things.</span> <span id="s1009">That is why there was a lot of bartering going on.</span> <span id="s1010">They hadn’t seen any good materials, any good shirts, any good anything, except what they made themselves in their houses and in their fields.</span> <span id="s1011">There were just no consumer goods.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">Q: When your family had forcibly vacated this house that they had been in for 3 years to go for 3 months to that camp, which you mentioned, was there any case of ransacking in the area which you left, or did you take things with you and then return with them?</span> <span id="s1013">How did that work out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">A: When we left the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1016">On your move inland, did you take your things with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">A: You always knew some people with whom you had had social contact before, maybe you had been neighbors.</span> <span id="s1018">You knew that you lost these things and you had no more use for them.</span> <span id="s1019">So there was nothing you could do about it.</span> <span id="s1020">You were better off giving it to somebody than just leaving and they were going to come and get it.</span> <span id="s1021">So I think that my mother gave the things away to a neighbor.</span> <span id="s1022">That is our piano and our furniture.</span> <span id="s1023">(Obviously he is now talking about their leaving Cernovcy, not Mogilev, to which place they had returned after the 3 months.)</span> <span id="s1024">O She just gave them as gifts.</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">Q: How did you get a piano and furniture?</span> <span id="s1026">(Apparently CE is puzzled about the switch also.)</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">A: Like when something happens to you, when you know that you are going to die, you take your possessions and try to give it to whoever you want to .</span> <span id="s1028">You give it away!</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">Q: My question still is: you moved into this abandoned house, which had nothing in it, not even a floor.</span> <span id="s1030">Where did you get a piano?</span> <span id="s1031">and furniture?</span> <span id="s1032">and that kind of thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">A: Oh!</span> <span id="s1034">I thought that we were talking about my home in Cernovcy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">Q: Oh, I am sorry, no I am still in the Ukraine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">A: Yes, but I thought you were referring to “who did you give your things to?”</span> <span id="s1037">(Transcriber attempted to straighten that out, calling it “house” in Mogilev and “home” in Cernovcy.)</span> <span id="s1038">Well we gave them away originally when we moved from the larger apartment to the smaller apartment.</span> <span id="s1039">Then we had to give it away.</span> <span id="s1040">When we left the apartment in Cernovcy to go by train, we had nothing but what we could carry with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">Q: You went back further than I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Q: I meant merely when you went from the city in the Ukraine to the camp for that 3 months stay.</span> <span id="s1044">I wondered whether you were allowed to take the few possessions which you had at that time with you, and carried them back when you escaped.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">A: Yes, you grabbed what you had.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">Q: There were very difficult conditions.</span> <span id="s1047">Sure.</span> <span id="s1048">Now can you give me some idea about how much time we are talking about?</span> <span id="s1049">Is this a matter of months or is it years.</span> <span id="s1050">What year are we talking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A: I tried to say that.</span> <span id="s1052">We came there in 1941 and stayed until 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s1054">That is what I wanted to clear up.</span> <span id="s1055">3 years!</span> <span id="s1056">(That is what FG had stated earlier.)</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">A: Yes, 3 1/2 years all together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">Q: Now what took place in 1944 which changed things?</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">A: In 1944, we increasingly started to hear about and actually see the Germans pull back.</span> <span id="s1060">We knew that they were pulling back and that the Russians were coming.</span> <span id="s1061">We started to raise our hopes.</span> <span id="s1062">We thought that the Germans were going to kill us before they left, we felt sure about it.</span> <span id="s1063">We just hoped that we would be able to survive.</span> <span id="s1064">Then one day, or rather one night, we started hearing in the far distance the boom of big guns, cannons from the front.</span> <span id="s1065">The next day we had some Germans move in with us.</span> <span id="s1066">They came from the front.</span> <span id="s1067">It was an officer with the SS sign (the SS sign or Schutz Staffel were the black shirted NAZI elite troops, who provided Hitler’s personal guard as well as the guards of concentration camps, etc.) who just walked in and said they he needed a house to stay in overnight and they looked at some maps and they made themselves at home.</span> <span id="s1068">My mother, again, shoved me to the next room, where there was another family, that young Rabbi, to sleep with them.</span> <span id="s1069">We had heard, actually, for 3 nights, bombardment by cannons from the front.</span> <span id="s1070">That night we heard a lot of shooting of rockets.</span> <span id="s1071">They were shooting the rockets which they called the Katuschia.</span> <span id="s1072">(This, at least what it sounds like to the transcriber.)</span> <span id="s1073">They were small rockets loaded on trucks.</span> <span id="s1074">There were 8 and 8, 16, of them in two batteries in back of a truck.</span> <span id="s1075">When they went through they just made a whistling sound (sound imitated by FG).</span> <span id="s1076">We were in the city of Mogilev on the Dnestr river.</span> <span id="s1077">The city was built down towards the river and, on the other side, there was a hill going up.</span> <span id="s1078">They were shooting up the other side of the hill all the time.</span> <span id="s1079">We heard explosions at night and there were rumors that the Russians, the partisans, particularly the Ukrainians were in German uniforms and they started sabotaging the German lines.</span> <span id="s1080">They would go across the bridge and blow it up while the Germans were still on the east side.</span> <span id="s1081">So our guests, they had to leave in a hurry.</span> <span id="s1082">They got up and left.</span> <span id="s1083">The last several hours they just jumped into the river on boards and anything to get across because they were cut off.</span> <span id="s1084">So then the Russians came.</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">Q: So it is the Russians who were cutting the Germans off at that point?</span> <span id="s1086">With the help of the partisans?</span> <span id="s1087">That particular night, I am just curious, whether the family was afraid that these particular Germans might kill them.</span> <span id="s1088">The ones who had moved into the house.</span> <span id="s1089">Was that a real fear, or did they realize that these people were there and were going to be gone?</span> <span id="s1090">You said that there was constant fear, always fear of death.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">A: Yes, constantly, we thought we were going to die.</span> <span id="s1092">I constantly used to think “how can I do it, that I can survive.”</span> <span id="s1093">I knew that I was not going to be able to survive and I was thinking about how one can improve humanity to the point where people would realize that one cannot do things like that, such barbaric things, and such wild things.</span> <span id="s1094">For years I have had ideas like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">Q: Now you were just 13, when that took place in 1944.</span> <span id="s1096">That is still very young.</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">A: I was not 13 yet.</span> <span id="s1098">I got back home to Cernovcy by the time I was 13.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">Q: That is still quite young.</span> <span id="s1100">So now the Germans are retreating, the Russians are moving in.</span> <span id="s1101">What was taking place at this point as far as your family is concerned?</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">A: When the Russians came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">A: Oh, that felt as if, all of a sudden, a heavy weight came off your chest, and you are totally free and you can breathe.</span> <span id="s1105">The Russians just walked in with their tanks and distributed some candy.</span> <span id="s1106">We felt liberated, totally liberated and free.</span> <span id="s1107">There still was fighting going on with bombardments at night and all this.</span> <span id="s1108">Now the Germans started to bombard the Russians, who had come into the city, but it was nothing worse than a thunderstorm.</span> <span id="s1109">We didn’t care too much at all.</span> <span id="s1110">Then we knew that we were going to survive.</span> <span id="s1111">We were very, very happy.</span> <span id="s1112">Then we got enough to eat.</span> <span id="s1113">That is really the happiest moment you can imagine when you can eat after a long hunger.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">Q: Can I ask you what time of the year we are talking about now?</span> <span id="s1115">Was it summer or winter?</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">A: Summer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">Q: Can you tell me a little about the season.</span> <span id="s1118">For the situation, as bad as it was for the 3 years which you lived under these conditions - I have heard of Russian winters being dreadful (CE fails to realize that she is talking of the south of Russia).</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">A: But you have never heard of the summers, have you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">A: The most beautiful summers and the most fragrant flowers grew.</span> <span id="s1122">I remember that air, it was so perfumed in the summer.</span> <span id="s1123">There were such beautiful flowers all over the place.</span> <span id="s1124">The fields were just very fertile and very, very beautiful.</span> <span id="s1125">You were working the soil with your feet by digging the ground with a shovel in order to prepare the soil for planting.</span> <span id="s1126">The winters were tough but we had some fun in the winter, too.</span> <span id="s1127">As I said we went skiing.</span> <span id="s1128">It was cold.</span> <span id="s1129">I don’t remember any particular suffering from the weather except that we were clothed well.</span> <span id="s1130">I just remember how beautiful the summers were.</span> <span id="s1131">Just beautiful.</span> <span id="s1132">The flowers, as I said, and the air so clean, the butterflies and such.</span> <span id="s1133">We just played constantly outside, ti was just beautiful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">Q: It is rather an extraordinary childhood, considering that you were only 13 years old by this time.</span> <span id="s1135">You had been through just about the extremes you could possibly have gone through.</span> <span id="s1136">Your memories run from terror to some very beautiful thoughts of the country you were in, despite the war which was going on.</span> <span id="s1137">You kind of ran the gamut of emotions for a child that young.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">A: We had everything, but more of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s1140">The Russians have moved in now and yo feel a great feeling of relief that you are not going to be killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">A: Yes, tremendous happiness in looking forward to the future.</span> <span id="s1142">It was a feeling like if you get a million or more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">Q: Had you been aware of some of what was going on.</span> <span id="s1144">You said that some people had radios and were aware of what was going on.</span> <span id="s1145">Had you been aware of what was happening to the Jewish people in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">A: No!</span> <span id="s1147">Well, no, we were not aware of exactly what was happening.</span> <span id="s1148">We knew that the NAZI’s (NAZI stands for National Sozialistige Partei; the party led and started by Adolf Hitler) wanted to exterminate the whole Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1149">We knew that we had been transported where we were to be exterminated!</span> <span id="s1150">We did not know about the details of the ovens and Auschwitz and Dachau.</span> <span id="s1151">I don’t remember knowing that, but just the fact of knowing that they were killing all the Jews and that we were there to be killed in just a matter of time was enough.</span> <span id="s1152">We knew that the Germans were going to kill us and we realized that the Romanians would not turn us over to the Germans.</span> <span id="s1153">We did not know how long that was going to last.</span> <span id="s1154">We didn’t think that the Romanians could hold out.</span> <span id="s1155">They didn’t hold out for anything else against the Germans.</span> <span id="s1156">But we didn’t know any details of how they did it.</span> <span id="s1157">We thought that they shot them all.</span> <span id="s1158">In Russia they shot them.</span> <span id="s1159">They took them out, you hear all the horror stories, they just came and rounded up all the Jews in a village.</span> <span id="s1160">Then they had them dig a grave (actually a trench), lined them up and shot them and pushed them in the grave.</span> <span id="s1161">That was that!</span> <span id="s1162">They didn’t use any sophisticated method.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">Q: You just made what I consider to be a very important point, when you said that the Romanians apparently did not turn over the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1164">Earlier you had said that they were not necessarily very strong, as a national and military unit.</span> <span id="s1165">Do you have any idea about how they managed to keep the strength where it was absolutely needed for the lives of your people.</span> <span id="s1166">At the same time they tended to be somewhat wishy-washy.</span> <span id="s1167">It seems like a paradox.</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1169">I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s1170">Antonescu (Gen. Ion Antonescu was the absolute ruler of Romania after King Carol was forced to abdicate after he had been forced to give up the province of Bessarabia and northern Bucovina to Russia as the result of the German-Russian treaty.</span> <span id="s1171">In fact, although King Michael was nominally King.</span> <span id="s1172">King Michael overthrew Antonescu in August 1944 and Romania switched sides in the war from the Axis to the Allied side) was the ruler of the country.</span> <span id="s1173">Maybe some of his conditions may have been about that; I don’t know what the details were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Q: Do you have any idea how many Romanian Jewish people were actually killed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">A: There were some figures made public, but I don’t know for sure.</span> <span id="s1176">There must have been a few hundred thousand.</span> <span id="s1177">However, there were many Romanian Jews, who survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">- - - - - - - - Here the tape ends and the new tape is started by summary of the fact that the portion just discussed pertained to the departure of the Germans from the Ukraine area where the family of Dr. Felix Garfunkel was and the Russians moving into the area.</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">Q: Now from that point on, can you tell me how events changed.</span> <span id="s1180">You say that you felt that you had been liberated.</span> <span id="s1181">Now you were convinced that you were going to survive.</span> <span id="s1182">The Germans were in retreat.</span> <span id="s1183">How long did your family stay in the Ukraine, from that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">A: As little as possible.</span> <span id="s1185">We right away moved into a different apartment in the city, after all the ghetto requirements were over and there was room available.</span> <span id="s1186">That meant that we were closer to the river and to the hustle and bustle of the city.</span> <span id="s1187">We could hear the bombing in the night.</span> <span id="s1188">My father was taken by Russians into the military right away.</span> <span id="s1189">He wound up in the Medical Corps.</span> <span id="s1190">He had no experience in medicine, but he wound up working as an orderly in a military hospital, I believe that the hospital was finally located in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1191">Then, we were left alone, my mother and myself, her sister and the kids.</span> <span id="s1192">Then we made our way back by foot to Cernovcy.</span> <span id="s1193">We had no transportation.</span> <span id="s1194">Everything was still chaotic.</span> <span id="s1195">I remember that we hit upon the idea that we were going to take one of those freight trains which went by at night.</span> <span id="s1196">We thought that we will get on and that nobody would see us and then to ride back to our hometown.</span> <span id="s1197">So one very dark night, in the middle of the night, when the guard was looking away, we scurried on a freight train.</span> <span id="s1198">The train was composed of box cars which were open on top with a lot of merchandise.</span> <span id="s1199">The cars were just bulging.</span> <span id="s1200">We made it up and tried to get a foothold and then sit down.</span> <span id="s1201">We tried to make ourselves small.</span> <span id="s1202">After a while the trains started moving.</span> <span id="s1203">We held on and we traveled all night long.</span> <span id="s1204">When it started getting light outside a little bit, we looked at what we were sitting on.</span> <span id="s1205">We were sitting on live ammunition, which they were shipping to the front.</span> <span id="s1206">But we had covered a good distance.</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">Q: Had it ever occurred to you, at that point, that you may have been advancing too quickly, in other words, that you may have been getting into an area that had not quite been liberated as yet and maybe putting yourselves back in danger?</span> <span id="s1208">If you had held back a while longer until things settled in that area and then moved in, would that not have been safer?</span> <span id="s1209">In other words, I am thinking that you might be advancing to where the fighting was taking place.</span> <span id="s1210">(Also in a battle, it is always possible for the losing side to launch a counterattack and regain much ground as was done during the Battle of the Bulge in Belgium later on, in Dec. 1944.</span> <span id="s1211">That, however is hardly the reasoning you can expect from a 13 year old.)</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">A: No, there was no danger of that because they really moved fast and by the time we started moving back to our hometown, the Front had moved way into eastern Europe, almost into the border of Germany.</span> <span id="s1213">(Events were happening very rapidly at the time, way outside of the ability of FG to know.</span> <span id="s1214">Some focal points were: 7-20-44, Front was on the Dnestr River; 7-23-44 Soviet troops drive on Vistula River in the North; 8-23-44 King Michael fires General Antonescu; 9-5-44 Russians troops enter Bucharest; 10-22-44 Soviet troops launch major drive in Ukraine; 1-17-45 Russian troops occupy Warsaw; 1-20-45 Russian troops surround Budapest.)</span> <span id="s1215">So they were several countries away.</span> <span id="s1216">They were very far away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">Q: When did you get off this box car?</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">A: We got off the next morning.</span> <span id="s1219">We kept walking, then we stayed overnight in a village.</span> <span id="s1220">The following day we moved on by foot.</span> <span id="s1221">We finally made it home and then we went to my aunt’s house.</span> <span id="s1222">We were so glad to see each other that it was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1223">We stayed there for a few days then my mother took a job and I went to school, we also got an apartment.</span> <span id="s1224">Her job was to work in an ice cream parlor, dishing out ice cream.</span> <span id="s1225">I kept on at school then I tried to learn a trade.</span> <span id="s1226">I became Bar Mizvohed there, when I became 13 years old, that July.</span> <span id="s1227">So we were moving about May (at that time the front lines must have been very close to Cernovcy, indeed).</span> <span id="s1228">I believe that we were liberated in May.</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">Q: Of 1944?</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">A: Yes, 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">Q: About your father?</span> <span id="s1232">He had been sent to Czechoslovakia?</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">A: Yes, he was taken by the military.</span> <span id="s1234">We didn’t know where he was at the time, until he wrote to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">Q: My question was, had the arrangements been made that he would return to your aunt’s place and meet you there sometime in the future?</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">A: I imagine that they would think of that, I guess, because he wrote to us.</span> <span id="s1237">I am not very aware of the communications between my parents throughout that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">Q: I am also kind of curious that an ice cream shop would be functioning in what I would assume to be a war-torn country.</span> <span id="s1239">(Actually there were no true battles in Romania proper, after the German rout from the Ukraine.)</span> <span id="s1240">It seemed rather a peaceful operation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">a: Oh, it is a very good thing.</span> <span id="s1242">Vanilla ice cream in Russia tastes very good.</span> <span id="s1243">Yes, it was working and the movies were functioning.</span> <span id="s1244">We were really living!</span> <span id="s1245">People who were living at that time were like coming back from the dead.</span> <span id="s1246">We enjoyed life fully, 200% more than you can imagine.</span> <span id="s1247">It is only after you come through horrible experiences like that, that you can really enjoy and be happy, because “after the darkest night, you best appreciate the light.”</span> <span id="s1248">It is the contrast.</span> <span id="s1249">“Joie de vivre” (French expression meaning “the enjoyment of life”) of the life in you was so strong that everyone seemed to have just a ball.</span> <span id="s1250">We went to movies and went everywhere.</span> <span id="s1251">There was an interesting phenomenon then, my cousin, who is older than I am by 5 years, which means that, at the time he was 17, going on 18, just back from a concentration camp, went with me to the movies; in the middle of the movie, all of a sudden he got hit on the head with a crutch.</span> <span id="s1252">He really started bleeding.</span> <span id="s1253">It turned out that some of the soldiers who got injured in the war got very upset when they saw somebody home who was not in uniform.</span> <span id="s1254">They thought that he was a coward or something and tried to hit him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">Q: Do you recall his reaction at that time?</span> <span id="s1256">Of that particular incident?</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">A: Well, he was of course, very appalled.</span> <span id="s1258">It was a horrible thing!</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">Q: Was he tattooed?</span> <span id="s1260">(CE asks about the concentration camp number tattoos.)</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">A: No.</span> <span id="s1262">They did not tattoo us in Trans-Dnestr.</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">Q: But he was in a concentration camp, you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">A: No, he was with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">Q: Oh, I am sorry, I misunderstood.</span> <span id="s1266">I thought that he had been sent in another direction and had been sent to a concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">A: No.</span> <span id="s1268">No!</span> <span id="s1269">We call it concentration camp in Trans-Dnestr.</span> <span id="s1270">It was also a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1271">However, it was not the same type as we are talking about in Germany.</span> <span id="s1272">It was more like a very close ghetto in the city, but it was still called a camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">Q: How long was it before you heard from your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">A: It would say it was about 2 months.</span> <span id="s1275">Then he wrote to us.</span> <span id="s1276">He was fine and we were fine.</span> <span id="s1277">While I was going to school I took a part time job in a hospital with a man who was making artificial limbs.</span> <span id="s1278">I was going to be an apprentice in that.</span> <span id="s1279">I remember him taking me to the forest to cut wood, because we were starting from scratch.</span> <span id="s1280">We went there in a big snowstorm with a sled and horses.</span> <span id="s1281">We had to push the sled because the horses got stuck.</span> <span id="s1282">So that is what we did then.</span> <span id="s1283">We were marching a lot in school like soldiers.</span> <span id="s1284">After another 11 months, almost the year had passed, all of a sudden there was announcement that people who had been born in Romania would be able to be repatriated.</span> <span id="s1285">(On May 7, 1945, Adm. Doenitz then German Fuhrer, surrendered to the Allied forces.)</span> <span id="s1286">Now I must say that this country where I had been born, that province and that city which used to be Austria from the last century until the end of WWI, then became Romania between WWI and WWII was declared a part of the Soviet Union as soon as the Russians came in.</span> <span id="s1287">That part of Romania is part of Russia now.</span> <span id="s1288">It is probably part of the Ukraine (it was actually made a part of the Moldavian Socialist Soviet Republic).</span> <span id="s1289">They said that they recognized that some Romanians may have been caught in that area and they would be “repatriated” if they would come Friday morning and sign up in such and such office.</span> <span id="s1290">(The claim by “ethnic Germans” who want to rejoin their country had been used by Germany to demand the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia and Poland prior to WWII.</span> <span id="s1291">Russia did not wish to leave itself open to such future claims so they determined that anyone who claimed not to be Russian should move out then and there.)</span> <span id="s1292">Well, we were there first thing Friday morning and we found a line which was several blocks long.</span> <span id="s1293">There was no end to it.</span> <span id="s1294">Everybody started to make up documents, that they were really not born here but way in the south.</span> <span id="s1295">For 2 days they registered a lot of people to let them out, then they stopped.</span> <span id="s1296">We were fortunate enough to have signed up.</span> <span id="s1297">We got into trucks and we got moved across the border into Romania from Russia.</span> <span id="s1298">I must tell you that, at that time, Romania was not part of the Soviet orbit (in 1947 King Michael abdicated and in 1948 Communists set up a Soviet type dictatorship when it joined the Soviet orbit).</span> <span id="s1299">The King was still there.</span> <span id="s1300">It was like going out of the prison again, from Russia into Romania.</span> <span id="s1301">Then we moved to Bucharest (44.26N, 26.06E) when we were liberated for the second time into Romania.</span> <span id="s1302">In Bucharest, we went to my aunt’s brother-in-law, who had a beautiful home.</span> <span id="s1303">They were lovely people.</span> <span id="s1304">They really received us very nicely.</span> <span id="s1305">We stayed with them for 2 weeks.</span> <span id="s1306">We had an abundance of food and everything.</span> <span id="s1307">Then we again rented an apartment.</span> <span id="s1308">My mother went to work for a dentist, as I remember.</span> <span id="s1309">She actually worked for 2 dentists.</span> <span id="s1310">They were a husband and wife, who were both dentists.</span> <span id="s1311">We stayed there for about 2 months, then my father came back from the military.</span> <span id="s1312">The war had ended in 1945, May of 1945.</span> <span id="s1313">After my father came back he took a job and we moved to Timisoara (45.45N, 21.13E), which is a city in Transylvania.</span> <span id="s1314">There I went to school again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">Q: I want to ask you whether your father was ever compensated for his initial loss of his business?</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">A: My father is receiving a pension, from the German government.</span> <span id="s1317">A monthly pension for living expenses.</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">Q: That had no connection to the loss of his plant?</span> <span id="s1319">He was never compensated directly for that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">A: No!</span> <span id="s1321">The Russians took it!</span> <span id="s1322">They didn’t compensate him, at least they haven’t yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">Q: One other question occurred to me.</span> <span id="s1324">Now your aunt, who lived in the section which was taken over by the Russians survived the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">A: In my hometown, Cenovcy, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">Q: Now did she, considering the fact that she stayed there, survived the war there, did she leave with you, or did she remain in her home?</span> <span id="s1327">Or did she retreat with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">A: She did not leave at that time, but she left afterwards, later, at another occasion.</span> <span id="s1329">I don’t remember how it came about.</span> <span id="s1330">Many people escaped from Russia.</span> <span id="s1331">I remember some young people took their chances to run across the border.</span> <span id="s1332">Neighbors of ours, Jewish people, they had 2 beautiful young daughters and a son, who was a chemist tried to escape.</span> <span id="s1333">One of the daughters got shot at the border trying to cross from Russia to Romania.</span> <span id="s1334">She got killed.</span> <span id="s1335">Many people escaped illegally, by running across the border and taking a chance to be killed.</span> <span id="s1336">We went across legally with a transport, in a way legally, actually we were not completely legal, because we used to pretense of being born somewhere else, that we were going to be repatriated.</span> <span id="s1337">As soon as we crossed we said where we were born, which was Cenovcy, but to the Russians we had said that we were born in Romania proper, in the south, in a different province, so that they would let us out.</span> <span id="s1338">There you have an example of not telling the truth in order to accomplish something that was very important.</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s1340">You have moved to Bucharest, and you are back in school again.</span> <span id="s1341">Having missed a great deal of schooling as a young child.</span> <span id="s1342">I wonder how you adjusted to this, being older.</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">A: I will tell you how.</span> <span id="s1344">Well in Bucharest, we just stopped a little bit and then we moved to Timisoara.</span> <span id="s1345">That is a beautiful city in Transylvania.</span> <span id="s1346">There I went to school and applied myself so that I could take exams and catch up on my studies.</span> <span id="s1347">I did two academic years in one and then I did three academic years in the second year.</span> <span id="s1348">So I had 5 years of high school in 2 years; that means doing the work and taking the exams in each one.</span> <span id="s1349">They permitted us to do that (many of the youngsters were in the same predicament since schooling had taken a back seat to warfare).</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">Q: In regard to this, were you an exceptionally good student?</span> <span id="s1351">I understand that it was a policy to do this but was it particularly easy for you as a student to be able to catch up and go ahead, as you did?</span> <span id="s1352">Otherwise said, was this a difficult period for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">A: It was difficult for me, but I was glad that I could accomplish it.</span> <span id="s1354">No, it wasn’t easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">Q: Your mother was working, your father has returned and gotten a job, living in an apartment and you working hard to catch up to your schooling.</span> <span id="s1356">Does anything now take place before you graduate from high school that we should mention before we go on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">A: For the first time, my uncle in the US found out now that we were alive through HIAS (Hebrew Immigration Aid Society; this was the agency which coordinated the immigration of Jews to the US and thereby put family members in touch with each other.</span> <span id="s1358">They became involved with the operation of the displaced person camps in Germany and other parts of Europe).</span> <span id="s1359">We got their letters first and a package with chewing gum in it.</span> <span id="s1360">I remember that.</span> <span id="s1361">That was the first time I saw chewing gum.</span> <span id="s1362">I thought that it was great.</span> <span id="s1363">Then we wrote to them that we would like to get out of Europe, if we could, before some more trouble starts.</span> <span id="s1364">So my uncle started working toward getting us out of Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">Q: When you mentioned chewing gum, it occurred to me; did you ever, at any time, come in contact with American armed forces.</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">Q: You are about 16 years old now, it was in about 1947 or 1948.</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">A: Yes, in 1947.</span> <span id="s1369">About 16 years old.</span> <span id="s1370">When we left Romania.</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">Q: You had graduated, or not graduated from high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">A: Not graduated.</span> <span id="s1373">I only had credit for 5 years out of the required 6.</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">Q: How long was it between the point where you had made contact with your uncle and your departure from Romania?</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">A: About one to two years, I would say, I don’t know exactly; between 1 and 2 years.</span> <span id="s1376">We were in Timisoara more like 2 years.</span> <span id="s1377">Then he prepared papers for us to come out to Ecuador.</span> <span id="s1378">He did that because it would have been a long wait for our numbers to appear on the quota to be admitted to the US.</span> <span id="s1379">(Until about 1948, the immigration to the US was governed by the laws of 1921 and 27.</span> <span id="s1380">These laws set up national quotas set to favor immigration from the British Isles, followed by northern Europe.</span> <span id="s1381">The quotas were based on proportion of population claiming descendency from various countries, and barred all persons of Chinese and Japanese origin.)</span> <span id="s1382">So, once we had that, we applied for passports, for Romanian passports.</span> <span id="s1383">We went to Bucharest to obtain exit visas.</span> <span id="s1384">It took a lot of doing.</span> <span id="s1385">We left with a boat in 1947.</span> <span id="s1386">The Romanian boat went to Marseilles, France (48.18N, 5.24E) through the Middle East.</span> <span id="s1387">We first stopped in Turkey, then outside Haifa, then Beirut, then Naples and then to Marseilles.</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">Q: Do you remember the name of the boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1390">I believe that it was called the S.S. Moto Mavi Transylvania.</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">Q: How long were you in France?</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">A: A whole year.</span> <span id="s1393">We were in Marseilles for several weeks and then we got to Paris.</span> <span id="s1394">We were accommodated in a hotel.</span> <span id="s1395">The Ecuadorian consul would not give us a visa right away.</span> <span id="s1396">He kept asking for documents.</span> <span id="s1397">We didn’t have any documents because they took everything away which we had.</span> <span id="s1398">So every time we had to start getting witnesses, when we tried to get some documents.</span> <span id="s1399">He kept asking for more and more identification and delayed giving us a visa for practically a year until he finally gave it to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">Q: Were the HIAS people supporting you during this year in France?</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">A: Yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">Q: Your father was not employed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">A: No.</span> <span id="s1404">I went to a school also during that time.</span> <span id="s1405">I went to a school run by ORT (another Jewish organization which still exists).</span> <span id="s1406">The initials of this organization stand for Overseas Relief Training, or something like that (they usually train would-be immigrants to Israel).</span> <span id="s1407">They trained young people.</span> <span id="s1408">I went to school in Paris to the ORT school; they gave us soup and they gave us instructions.</span> <span id="s1409">I learned electronics, such as how to solder, repair radios and such things.</span> <span id="s1410">They did not teach academic courses.</span> <span id="s1411">I wanted to go to Berlitz and learn Spanish and English, but I couldn’t go to regular school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">Q: Did it ever occur to your family to seek passage to the land of Israel (immigration to Israel was limited to the point of being nonexistent, except for youngsters, until May of 1948 when statehood was voted in for Israel by the United Nations)?</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">A: Israel wasn’t there yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">Q: Well the land of Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">A: Yes, I know what you mean.</span> <span id="s1416">Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">Q: Yes, Palestine was under English rule at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">A: It was prohibited at that time to go to Palestine, and we had visas to go to Ecuador.</span> <span id="s1419">We had nobody (no relatives) in Palestine.</span> <span id="s1420">We had relatives both in the US and in Ecuador.</span> <span id="s1421">We also had relatives in Brazil.</span> <span id="s1422">My father had a cousin in Costa Rica.</span> <span id="s1423">We had no one in Palestine.</span> <span id="s1424">People were prohibited from going to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1425">As a matter of fact, the Romanian ship had to stop way outside of the harbor when we stopped in Haifa, and the English patrols were constantly going around the ship to see that nobody jumped off the ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">Q: So a year passed before you left for Ecuador, until the papers were finally ready for you to go.</span> <span id="s1427">Do you recall the name of the ship you left France on to go to Ecuador?</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">A: It was a much bigger ship, I thought that you wanted the name.</span> <span id="s1429">We left from LeHavre (49.30N, 0.08E).</span> <span id="s1430">We had to take a train to go to LeHavre which is way in the north of France (LeHavre is actually located at the mouth of the estuary of the Seine, just west of Paris).</span> <span id="s1431">From there we went to Rio de Janeiro (22.54S, 43.15W), which was then the capital of Brazil).</span> <span id="s1432">On the way it stopped in Dakar, which used to be Western French Africa (capital of Senegal).</span> <span id="s1433">In Rio de Janeiro, my father’s brother, Karl, waited for us.</span> <span id="s1434">He took us to my aunt’s house.</span> <span id="s1435">We stayed there.</span> <span id="s1436">They had a beautiful house.</span> <span id="s1437">We stayed there for several weeks, 2 months, I believe.</span> <span id="s1438">My mother did not like it there.</span> <span id="s1439">It was very hot in July in Rio de Janeiro (that is the middle of the winter in the Southern Hemisphere).</span> <span id="s1440">Then we took a plane to Quito, Ecuador (0.13S, 78.30W, the capital of Ecuador, located high in the mountains).</span> <span id="s1441">This was our final destination, the capital of Ecuador that is on the west coast of South America.</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">Q: Let me ask you.</span> <span id="s1443">On the two ships on which you traveled, on the one from Germany (she obviously means Romania) to France and the one from France to Rio de Janeiro, in either or both cases, were these refugee ships?</span> <span id="s1444">(What is meant by a “refugee ship” is not clear.)</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s1446">That Romanian ship was a luxury motor boat (probably meaning a regular ocean going passenger ship) but it had a lot of refugees on it.</span> <span id="s1447">However, once you were on the boat, they treated you royally.</span> <span id="s1448">Food which I hadn’t seen for many, many years was served.</span> <span id="s1449">It was just beautiful.</span> <span id="s1450">They had a lot of refugees on it, but it was primarily a luxury liner.</span> <span id="s1451">The boat from LeHavre was a regular ship transporting people (many ships traveling the route from LeHavre to South America carried mainly cargo, but also some passengers).</span> <span id="s1452">It was not as elegant as the Romanian ship, however, it was a very fine regular ship, full of people.</span> <span id="s1453">I think that there were a lot of refugees on it.</span> <span id="s1454">However, it was not primarily a refugee boat, it was a regularly scheduled liner.</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">Q: You were aware of the fact that many of these people had come from Germany (the ships which were filled with people from the displaced person camps were usually chartered by HIAS or the US Government and left Homburg for New york) or from other areas or from France.</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">A: Yes, there were all kinds of refugees, that is right.</span> <span id="s1457">Some of them were Turkish refugees, I remember, or from Morocco or from Eastern Europe or from Africa, all people who were refugees and were traveling to South America.</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">Q: I have a question about what you had gone through up to this point.</span> <span id="s1459">You had mentioned a boy in the Ukraine by name, as a matter of fact a couple of times; had you established a lasting friendship during this era of your life?</span> <span id="s1460">Were you able to reestablish a friendship with this boy that you had known?</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">A: No.</span> <span id="s1462">You mean after I left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">A: No.</span> <span id="s1465">None whatsoever.</span> <span id="s1466">There was no way.</span> <span id="s1467">No mail, nothing.</span> <span id="s1468">I didn’t know his address anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">Q: As far as you traveling through France, or in France, nothing had been established at all, in any way between you and other people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">A: Yes, I had made friends with a number of people, as a matter of fact, close friends.</span> <span id="s1471">One was a young man who roomed with me at that hotel (obviously in Paris).</span> <span id="s1472">He went to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1473">I believe that he became an officer there.</span> <span id="s1474">He was a very capable young man.</span> <span id="s1475">I also got friendly with a young girl who also went to Ecuador.</span> <span id="s1476">We are still friends.</span> <span id="s1477">She has her family.</span> <span id="s1478">Whenever I go to Ecuador, I visit her.</span> <span id="s1479">She lives in Quito.</span> <span id="s1480">Her husband is a manufacturer of shirts.</span> <span id="s1481">Her family and my family are now living in Lima, Peru (12.03S, 77.03W).</span> <span id="s1482">These were all refugee people.</span> <span id="s1483">We didn’t make any contacts with the French.</span> <span id="s1484">We were not together with the French.</span> <span id="s1485">We stayed in a hotel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">Q: That is what I meant.</span> <span id="s1487">Yes, among the refugees.</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">A: Yes, a number of refugees.</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">Q: OK, you have gone to Ecuador.</span> <span id="s1490">Can you tell me about your life in Ecuador?</span> <span id="s1491">What took place there?</span> <span id="s1492">You returned to school, I assume.</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">A: Yes, I returned to high school and I graduated high school.</span> <span id="s1494">We had a beautiful life there, at least it was for me.</span> <span id="s1495">It think that it is a beautiful life.</span> <span id="s1496">My father went into business there, with the help of his brother from the US.</span> <span id="s1497">He came and loaned him some money.</span> <span id="s1498">My father opened a business and operated it for 22 years.</span> <span id="s1499">I went to school.</span> <span id="s1500">I finished high school, then I went to medical school.</span> <span id="s1501">After I finished medical school, we came to the US.</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">Q: May I ask what business your father went into?</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">A: He went into the retail business of men and women’s clothing, he specialized in shirts and socks, underwear, sweaters, that kind of thing.</span> <span id="s1504">During the time I was in medical school, I learned how to weave sweaters, then I started my own factory so that I could get married.</span> <span id="s1505">I was still a student when I got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">Q: Was there a large refugee community in the city of Quito?</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">A: No, that was relatively small.</span> <span id="s1508">In the whole country, there were 4000 Jews - 3000 of those lived in Quito.</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">Q: Were you aware at the time that apparently many German NAZI’s had also immigrated to South America?</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">A: I had heard of that, but didn’t believe that there were many in Ecuador.</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">Q: It was not something that anybody gave much thought to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">A: No.</span> <span id="s1513">Not much thought.</span> <span id="s1514">You had a strong feeling every time you talked to a German.</span> <span id="s1515">You wondered what he was before.</span> <span id="s1516">They would always say, “Well, I didn't know what was happening.</span> <span id="s1517">I think that is horrible.</span> <span id="s1518">I would never have dreamed of that!”</span> <span id="s1519">However, you guessed what they had done by age.</span> <span id="s1520">When you knew someone who was in an age group that he could not have been a NAZI, doing all these things, you guessed that he was all right.</span> <span id="s1521">However, if they are older you never have the confidence to believe what they say.</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">Q: Had you ever felt vindictive about these people?</span> <span id="s1523">These Germans?</span> <span id="s1524">These NAZI’s?</span> <span id="s1525">How do you feel about what took place in so far as they were concerned?</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">A: Not so much, except I considered like an accident which can happen any place.</span> <span id="s1527">As far as vindictiveness is concerned, I think that I feel good when I think that Germany is divided.</span> <span id="s1528">There is an “Eastern part and a Western part” of Germany.</span> <span id="s1529">So I said, “Well, good.”</span> <span id="s1530">When I go to Germany and I see the American troops there I say that is good.</span> <span id="s1531">I am glad to see the US troops there, or whatever other Allied troops there are.</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">Q: You went to medical school?</span> <span id="s1533">What branch of medicine are you in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1534">A: I am in radiology, imaging.</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">Q: You came to the US in 1951 or 1953?</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">A: In 1958!</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">Q: Oh, ‘58.</span> <span id="s1538">That is quite late.</span> <span id="s1539">You had gotten married before that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">A: I went to Ecuador in 1948.</span> <span id="s1541">I graduated in ‘58 and came over to the US.</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">Q: You were married, you said, at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1544">I got married in ‘54, at the end of ‘54.</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">Q: What is your wife’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">A: Erika.</span></p> <p><span id="s1547">Q: Yes, that’s right.</span> <span id="s1548">You have 2 children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">A: 3.</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">Q: 3 children.</span> <span id="s1551">Their names are?</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">A: David, he is 25; Janice, she is 22 and Michael is 19.</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">Q: Where were they born?</span></p> <p><span id="s1554">A: David was born in Ecuador.</span> <span id="s1555">He came here when he was 2 1/2 years old.</span> <span id="s1556">Janice and Michael were born in the US.</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">Q: Obviously you have become US citizens.</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">Q: That is interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">A: We became citizens in 1963.</span> <span id="s1561">Janice was born in Long Branch, New Jersey (40.17N, 73.59W) while I took my internship at Monmouth medical Center.</span> <span id="s1562">Michael was born in Boston at Beth Israel hospital where I had my residency.</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">Q: Can I ask you why you came to the US at that time?</span> <span id="s1564">Apparently things were quite nice in Ecuador.</span> <span id="s1565">Why change?</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">A: Things were nice in Ecuador, but in Ecuador you can make a good living as a middle class person by being in business or industry.</span> <span id="s1567">The professions were not as well paid.</span> <span id="s1568">The professions were not as advanced and the facilities were not available as we have them here.</span> <span id="s1569">Now, if I had been a general practitioner, I could have made out all right.</span> <span id="s1570">I came here, to the US, for my graduate training.</span> <span id="s1571">It is not easy to find modern, complete equipment for a radiologist, to work with in Ecuador.</span> <span id="s1572">Besides that I felt my children would find a better future in the US.</span> <span id="s1573">In Ecuador, they treated us very well, but you always were a foreigner there, because they have different physical appearance.</span> <span id="s1574">You don’t know what kind of foreigner you are, everyone is “gringo,” which means Americans; even if you are from Russia, they still call you “American.”</span> <span id="s1575">You always look different, in the country.</span> <span id="s1576">I thought that I would be a lot happier in the US.</span> <span id="s1577">These are some of the reasons.</span> <span id="s1578">The US with its freedom and its ideal of a melting pot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">Q: You were obviously happy in Ecuador, I wonder about your reactions when you got to the US.</span> <span id="s1580">It is quite different here, I assume than what you were used to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">A: I was very happy here also when I came, but I had to work very hard as an intern.</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">Q: I am going to ask you a couple of questions about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">A: I was glad that I survived the heavy work, and that I got used to it.</span> <span id="s1584">As interns, we used to work 36 hours and then were off 1 1/2 hours.</span> <span id="s1585">That is an intern in a hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">Q: I know that they have that kind of schedule.</span> <span id="s1587">You, and I assume, Erika too, although I don’t know her story, have had, what I would consider a rather traumatic background, in your lives.</span> <span id="s1588">You have had some very horrible experiences, and some very good experiences.</span> <span id="s1589">I am asking the following questions for a professor, who is interested in this particular area of human development.</span> <span id="s1590">You have raised 3 children.</span> <span id="s1591">Have you conscientiously raised your children differently perhaps than you might have if you had not gone through this vast experience; the stress which you had to live through, and what have you.</span> <span id="s1592">Were there things which you taught your children to know, or things that you did, which you may not have done, if you had not lived through this experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">A: I am sure that we are the results of what we have been, and that some of my experiences have come through.</span> <span id="s1594">However, that was not my intention.</span> <span id="s1595">My intention was to give them as happy and full life as possible.</span> <span id="s1596">I have been sorry, many times and appalled to know how little they know about my background, how little I have talked to them about it.</span> <span id="s1597">Perhaps, I didn’t do a very good job in actually presenting my background to them, but if you take the general effect on raising children, there must have been something in it, perhaps.</span> <span id="s1598">It must have been something, but it wasn’t intentional.</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">Q: I’d like to know also, whether you are a particularly religious man now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">A: No!</span> <span id="s1601">On the contrary, I have broken with the religion, so to speak.</span> <span id="s1602">When I was a young child under those conditions, I kept always wondering about that whole story on which these persecutions are based and why we had to go through this and suffer.</span> <span id="s1603">I have had a hard time believing religion.</span> <span id="s1604">I am trying to.</span> <span id="s1605">My family is more religious than I am.</span> <span id="s1606">We go to a reform congregation.</span> <span id="s1607">We belong to it and I go to all services, I mean on the Holy Days.</span> <span id="s1608">I have tried to raise the kids in a really religious family.</span> <span id="s1609">(FG’s father, who had settled in Dayton when FG’s mother died during a visit to Dayton of the older Garfunkels, joined the orthodox congregation in Dayton.)</span> <span id="s1610">My daughter is pretty good in Jewish things (she became an ordained Rabbi in Reform Judaism).</span> <span id="s1611">I cannot say that I am a very strong believer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">Q: Were your sons Bar Mizvohed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">Q: One more question.</span> <span id="s1615">Basically, why did you come to Dayton?</span> <span id="s1616">What brought you here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">A: Actually during my internship, I looked for a residency in radiology and I was fortunate enough to get one in Cincinnati, which is one of the top schools, where there is a very good, truly world famous man.</span> <span id="s1618">He is Professor of Radiology there, at Jewish Hospital.</span> <span id="s1619">So I took my training there, then I went to Boston for year.</span> <span id="s1620">Then I realized how good it was here and how much I liked Ohio, so I wanted to come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">Q: This makes me smile, because I am from the Boston area.</span> <span id="s1622">That was my hometown, not truly my hometown, but I lived right outside of Boston.</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">A: I liked Ohio better.</span> <span id="s1624">I found that the people were a little cold there, until you get to know them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">A: Oh!</span> <span id="s1626">That is very true.</span> <span id="s1627">New England is a little standoffish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">A: They are not as friendly.</span> <span id="s1629">The pace is easier, the weather is warmer here.</span> <span id="s1630">I thought that the living was easier here, than in Boston.</span> <span id="s1631">I had a hard time getting from Cromwell Avenue (transcriber is not at all sure of the name of the avenue) to City Hospital, that is certain.</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">Q: The drivers are also notoriously bad there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1633">A: It was also very expensive to live there.</span> <span id="s1634">I didn’t like it when I had to pay automobile insurance in Boston.</span> <span id="s1635">Are you familiar with that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1637">Very much so.</span> <span id="s1638">My parents still live there.</span> <span id="s1639">But this is aside from our tape.</span> <span id="s1640">Is there anything about which I have not asked you, or neglected to ask you, about your life, which you would like to include at this time?</span> <span id="s1641">Otherwise, I think that we are about to wrap up this interview.</span> <span id="s1642">I wonder if we have neglected anything, which you think is pertinent?</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">A: I don’t think that I said a lot of things which I might have thought about, sometime or other, but it doesn’t occur to me now.</span> <span id="s1644">During the 3 1/2 years, during which I was in a concentration camp in the Ukraine (actually FG was not in a camp at all, in the conventional sense of the term, except possibly for the 3 months during his third summer in the Ukraine) in Mogilev.</span> <span id="s1645">That was a very hard and horrible experience.</span> <span id="s1646">But I really don’t have all that many recollections.</span> <span id="s1647">However, even during these 3 1/2 years I had some happy times, as I said, playing with the kids.</span> <span id="s1648">We cannot give as many details as all the older people, who may have a better recollection.</span> <span id="s1649">I was thinking myself, when I talked to my friend, Murray (Dr. Murray Weisman is certainly the person being referred to.</span> <span id="s1650">His story including his several years in the Auschwitz and other concentration camps is on file in the Dayton WSU Oral History archives) for a very long time about his horrible experiences.</span> <span id="s1651">He asked me about my experiences.</span> <span id="s1652">I have kind of a void (it appears that the Romanian dictator truly did not allow Romanian Jews to be mistreated and abused the way the NAZI’s treated other Jews).</span> <span id="s1653">I might have blurred the recollections in my mind, or something but I just do not recollect that many details, from that time.</span> <span id="s1654">I wish that I would be able to give you a lot more details.</span> <span id="s1655">During these almost 4 years, when we were under war conditions in NAZI territory during the war, I just don’t have that much to say about it.</span> <span id="s1656">(Food in the Ukraine also does seem to have been more, according to human needs, than it was elsewhere.)</span> <span id="s1657">I wish that I could say more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">Q: So I think that we are done.</span> <span id="s1659">I would like to thank you very much for the time you spent with me, this evening.</span></p> <p><span id="s1660">A: I thank you.</span></p></body></html>
