interview with Chayale Ash-Fuhrman, done on September 21, 1981 with Josey Fisher.</span> <span id="s3">Tape 1, side 1.</span> <span id="s4">Mrs. Fuhrman, can you tell me when and where you were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s5">CA: I was born in 1920 in the city of Kishinev.</span> <span id="s6">It was the capital of the province Bessarabia.</span> <span id="s7">Till 1918 Bessarabia was Russia.</span> <span id="s8">From 1918 and further till 1940 it belongs to Romania, so we were always using simultaneously three languages.</span> <span id="s9">Russian in the streets, Romanian in the school, and Yiddish at home.</span> <span id="s10">I was born there, my parents were born there, my brother was born there, my grandparents were born there, and all my youth, my childhood, I was in the same street, in the same house, grew up together with children, what most of them are not alive today, only one family what I met in 1973, when I went to see my town.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">JF: What kind of community was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">CA: Kishinev was a specific, very Jewish community.</span> <span id="s13">A lot of Jews came to Bessarabia from Russia after Romania took over the province, took it away from Russia, so a lot of Jewish people came in, so Kishinev became a really Jewish community.</span> <span id="s14">It was a lot Jews and Russians, no Romanians there, very little Romanian community, only the army what was standing around the town was Romanian people.</span> <span id="s15">But usually it was only Jewish people and a little Moldavian people, they call it.</span> <span id="s16">That’s the reason when the Russians took it over in 1940 they called it Moldavian Republic, because it was Moldavian people there.</span> <span id="s17">Moldavian people is a mixture between Ukrainians, Russians and Romanians and their language what is similar to Romanian but mixed with Russian-Slavic words and...but you never learned Moldavian, you learned...even now in Russia they don’t teach Moldavian language.</span> <span id="s18">They are forcing Russian language in Moldavian Republic.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">JF: So the immediate streets that you were familiar with were primarily Jewish families?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">CA: All Jewish families.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">JF: All Jewish families.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">CA: Because my grandparents were really deep Jewish families...in that time you didn’t know about too much assimilated families.</span> <span id="s23">Jewish people were Jewish people.</span> <span id="s24">Assimilated maybe you found in very big places like Moscow or Leningrad or Bucharest in Romania.</span> <span id="s25">This is like little Paris or whatever they call it but in Bessarabia in the towns they were really Jewish people.</span> <span id="s26">They could be intellectual differently but very little assimilated.</span> <span id="s27">Grandparents mostly, they were very religious and our house was...but it’s interesting very modern religious, they did not impose on the children and grandchildren nothing religious.</span> <span id="s28">I could travel on Shabbos, I could do certain things.</span> <span id="s29">We didn’t have telephones in these places but I could put on the light on Shabbos.</span> <span id="s30">Grandma would not do it but she didn’t impose on us not to do it, and my grandfather was playing chess with very important Jewish people who came into our home.</span> <span id="s31">He told us that in the 18-- something he was even in America for a while and he didn’t like it too much, and he didn’t find a job so he came back to Bessarabia.</span> <span id="s32">He was...Grandfather was a fantastic person, because from this grandfather came out a big actor like my father was.</span> <span id="s33">He loved theatre, he loved the newspaper, he loved chess.</span> <span id="s34">Imagine in that time to be this modern, but in the same time he was very religious, in a certain way, and he worked as a correspondent secretary from the synagogues for hiring cantors for the synagogues.</span> <span id="s35">He was very, how you call it?</span> <span id="s36">He could write Russian, and Hebrew and Yiddish, so he was the one who corresponded with cantors all over the world to bring in to the synagogues.</span> <span id="s37">And Grandma was the sweetest woman in the world.</span> <span id="s38">My parents were actors.</span> <span id="s39">They traveled around and I was left by my, be raised by grandparents.</span> <span id="s40">It was time there was no food in the house...very, very poor.</span> <span id="s41">Why they were poor?</span> <span id="s42">He was paid by the synagogues.</span> <span id="s43">Twice a year.</span> <span id="s44">For Passover and before the High Holidays.</span> <span id="s45">This was the time he was paid and in between came, I remember a Purim and my grandmother was sitting crying there was no food in the house and I remember sending me to school...she didn’t have nothing to give me for lunch.</span> <span id="s46">She took empty bottles under the shawl and changed them for a piece of halvah.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">JF: It sounds like your grandparents, then, were like parents to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">CA: And she gave me a piece of halvah or a little something to take with me to school.</span> <span id="s49">I walked to school very, very far, didn’t have any money to pay for the, we used to go by the tramway.</span> <span id="s50">You know what’s tramway?</span> <span id="s51">electrical car.</span> <span id="s52">So, but in the house was always...we had paintings on the walls.</span> <span id="s53">My father was an artist and a younger son, an uncle what lived together with us, he was very how you say it?</span> <span id="s54">socialistic inclined, and went around with lectures and other things to make a better world.</span> <span id="s55">And I was raised in a very interested family with grandparents religious, and my uncle and aunts very awakened in the time for to making a better world, how do you say?</span> <span id="s56">And it was really...I felt good but in the same time I suffered very, very much.</span> <span id="s57">I saw my parents mostly when I was young till 10 years old only summertime.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">JF: Now, your grandparents sound like they had quite liberal children.</span> <span id="s59">Were they able to deal with that or was it hard for them?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">CA: No.</span> <span id="s61">Yes, they were able to deal with that.</span> <span id="s62">That is the thing I saw before.</span> <span id="s63">They were very, very...I don’t find an English word to say, they, I really don’t know how the word, it is, you have to compromise and find, and this was Grandma and the same way was Grandfather.</span> <span id="s64">Very, very understanding people.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">JF: What kind of Jewish education, formal Jewish education, were you able to have?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">CA: I had my first four classes, they were regular elementary school.</span> <span id="s67">After that I made, in three different towns, in three different towns I made like they call it complementary school.</span> <span id="s68">Like here in America you have eight grades, four and then four junior high, I don’t talk about senior high because this is already like in our places it they were called Lyceum.</span> <span id="s69">But other four they called it complementary adding, like complementary grades, so I went for the fifth grade and sixth like after the four in three, four different towns because I started trouble with my parents.</span> <span id="s70">I started in school and in the middle I had to leave and go to another town.</span> <span id="s71">And I start again in another town and I made one grade in three, four towns.</span> <span id="s72">It was very hard for me and I was a very, very good student.</span> <span id="s73">I dreamed to go and continue my education and I don’t know how far it was, but all these circumstances were impossible.</span> <span id="s74">I finished up my four grades in elementary every year with bronze medals and diplomas and I was always a sick girl and a complaining girl and nervous.</span> <span id="s75">I always had with the stomach before going to school.</span> <span id="s76">You know like some kids are?</span> <span id="s77">And all my aunts and uncles dreamt.</span> <span id="s78">They played on the lottery to win money to send Chayale to high school.</span> <span id="s79">This was their dream always because I was a fantastic student.</span> <span id="s80">Only because I didn’t have the means like maybe other kids, but, thank God, they had uniforms in school.</span> <span id="s81">A little black dress with a white collar and a bow.</span> <span id="s82">I could look like other kids; if no, I would feel very bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">JF: You’re talking now about the elementary school?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">CA: Yes, elementary and higher even.</span> <span id="s85">Uniforms, in Romania they always wear uniforms.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">JF: This is a public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">CA: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">JF: Were there non-Jews there as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">CA: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">JF: Then what was your experience with the non-Jewish children in public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">CA: Very nice.</span> <span id="s92">First, maybe because I was a very good student, and they used to cling to a good student, to help him out.</span> <span id="s93">Usually I went home with a group of children and helped them to make the homework all together.</span> <span id="s94">Maybe this was the reason and I didn’t feel any...absolutely nothing.</span> <span id="s95">Not from the teachers and not from the students.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">JF: And not from the parents either?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">CA: No, no.</span> <span id="s98">No.</span> <span id="s99">In that time in those countries (?)</span> <span id="s100">I didn’t know nobody from the parents of the students.</span> <span id="s101">I could have one or two close friends that I knew the parents and they were Jewish, but usually you never knew the parents from the other students.</span> <span id="s102">As I remember now.</span> <span id="s103">And after I finished I stopped again, standing in Kishinev and I..</span> <span id="s104">.</span> <span id="s105">how you say it?</span> <span id="s106">enrolled, or enlisted in a professional school.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">JF: You’re jumping now until after...?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">CA: Right in the beginning, after I finished the fifth and sixth grades I went to a school, starting from the beginning again, from the fifth in a professional school, what is called professional.</span> <span id="s109">It was called “Professional School for Girls.”</span></p> <p><span id="s110">JF: So, let me just clarify this for a minute.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">CA: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">JF: After you had had four years in the public school you started traveling with your parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">CA: And, I made the fifth and sixth grades in different towns.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">JF: And why, at that point, did your parents decide to take you on the road with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">CA: Because, I grew up and I asked for it, to be with my parents, one.</span> <span id="s116">Secondly, it was very hard for my grandparents to hold me.</span> <span id="s117">My aunt married and moved out and they were alone and old.</span> <span id="s118">It was hard for them to keep me.</span> <span id="s119">Later on, when I decided that I cannot do any more different towns the same...I would never finish up no school.</span> <span id="s120">I decided to stay again, but I was staying in my aunt’s place...</span></p> <p><span id="s121">JF: This was your father’s sister, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">CA: No, it was father’s brother’s wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">JF: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">CA: I mean, uncle and aunt.</span> <span id="s125">I was living with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">JF: And the name of this school was “The Professional...?”</span></p> <p><span id="s127">CA: “The Professional School for Girls.”</span> <span id="s128">But this was a specific Jewish school.</span> <span id="s129">Private Jewish school.</span> <span id="s130">I didn’t pay in that school; it was supported by the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s131">And in this school you could learn a trade, the same time you had education.</span> <span id="s132">You worked...learned to work and worked from morning until 12:00, from 12:00 till 1:00 you had an hour intermission, with hot food to eat, a lunch, and from 1:00 to 5:00 it was learning.</span> <span id="s133">It was Romanian language, as a language.</span> <span id="s134">Yiddish, Jewish was done everything in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s135">I had geography in Yiddish, mathematics in Yiddish, and, how you call it, history in Yiddish, Jewish history, and Yiddish was the main language in that school to learn everything.</span> <span id="s136">It was like a Yiddish Jewish day school.</span> <span id="s137">But it was higher.</span> <span id="s138">I learned French as a second language in that school.</span> <span id="s139">It was obligatory.</span> <span id="s140">I don’t know how you say it, and the same way, you could learn dental technician, you would learn leather works, bags and belts and all kinds of what’s to do with leather, and sewing.</span> <span id="s141">Embroidery and sewing.</span> <span id="s142">I started as technician, but I was so skinny, and so green and blue, that the work with technician didn’t agree with me.</span> <span id="s143">I came home always with headaches.</span> <span id="s144">They worked with fire, with rubber, with cultures of all kinds, so I changed for sewing.</span> <span id="s145">In this sewing school I finished.</span> <span id="s146">And thanks to them I survived a lot of times.</span> <span id="s147">I survived the war by knowing sewing.</span> <span id="s148">This will come later.</span> <span id="s149">I finished sewing.</span> <span id="s150">I make even now my costumes and evening gowns for the stage myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">JF: Now, during those years did you also learn Hebrew?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">CA: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">JF: Not at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">CA: Only Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">JF: Did you attend any kind of Hebrew or Jewish history in school other than your...</span></p> <p><span id="s156">CA: I knew very, very much because we were learning in school in the Yiddish language.</span> <span id="s157">History of the Jews.</span> <span id="s158">Not about Israel but about history of the Jews, and I knew a lot about all Jewish writers, all Yiddish literature, everything to make you be proud as Jew without learning Hebrew.</span> <span id="s159">I learned Hebrew a lot.</span> <span id="s160">From the Jewish language I understood a lot of Hebrew.</span> <span id="s161">Because Yiddish is full of Hebrew idioms and words.</span> <span id="s162">And, the same time, later on...when I didn’t went to school any more, my parents took a teacher and I learned Hebrew, to read, to write and to know about, and it came in handy a lot in the Yiddish language, being I was lectured in Yiddish and it gave me well what Hebrew I knew.</span> <span id="s163">But my parents tried to give me...they took a teacher and I learned Gothic German and Hebrew in the same time and I know perfect Gothic German, to write and to read now, and I like to catch in a lot and I learned, I learned, I knew a lot of Hebrew, read and write before I came to Israel I knew a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">JF: You said you had a brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">CA: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">JF: He was younger than you?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">CA: Younger, two years younger.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">JF: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">CA: His name is, in Jewish Yaacov.</span> <span id="s170">And in Russian they call him Yasha.</span> <span id="s171">He still signs his paintings...he is one of the biggest artists in Russia now.</span> <span id="s172">He is still there, in Kishinev, and he signs his paintings Yasha Ash.</span> <span id="s173">We are continuing and the reason that I continue my stage name because Ash was my father’s stage name, and up till now theatre or artist’s painting we signs always our name Ash.</span> <span id="s174">We want to continue with father’s name.</span> <span id="s175">He worked too hard for that name.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">JF: Can you tell me a little bit about your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">CA: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">JF: And their stage experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">CA: My father was an actor, very young, started with amateur groups and became an actor.</span> <span id="s180">When he met mother...he met her in an amateur group being the director.</span> <span id="s181">And they married and they entered the professional theatre together.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">JF: When you say the professional theatre...?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">CA: Yiddish professional theatre.</span> <span id="s184">Yiddish theatre in Romania...it was born in Romania.</span> <span id="s185">Yiddish theatre comes from Romania.</span> <span id="s186">Abraham Goldfaden, the father of the Yiddish theatre, founded the first Yiddish theatre in Jassy, Romania, and it was really blossoming in Romania all these years.</span> <span id="s187">Even in the First World War, it was really a boom of the Yiddish theatre, and he dedicated all his life.</span> <span id="s188">He was a fantastic makeup man.</span> <span id="s189">He was a fantastic painter, you don’t say painter...artist.</span> <span id="s190">Art painter, I mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">JF: You’re speaking now of your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">CA: Father, yes.</span> <span id="s193">All my families after that are taking after my father.</span> <span id="s194">He was a big artist, and since not finishing school he used to make all of scenery.</span> <span id="s195">In that time it wasn’t a theatre with a special one to make the scenery and a special one to design the scenery, another one to make the make-up and a third one...It was a group of actors who worked very hard bringing Yiddish theatre to the people, and doing everything for themselves.</span> <span id="s196">My father...he could come in the theatre in a little town not finding any sceneries, take newspapers and put them on the back of the wall and in one minute was a forest, or a sea or whatever it has to be the background of the show and they used to...I remember, they used to wear front for a tuxedo, not the whole shirt, only the front, you know, the starched front of the tuxedo.</span> <span id="s197">And it was times that one pair of shoes was worn by the same two or three actors, if they were not at the same time on the stage.</span> <span id="s198">This was the real pioneering of the Yiddish theatre.</span> <span id="s199">I remember times we were traveling with wagons, covered wagons, I remember that because I was little in the summertime.</span> <span id="s200">The covered wagons, like you see in the West, the pioneer, and my father used to [unclear] with the children, this was the way they traveling, the actors, going from little...the town could have 500 Jews, but they came to perform in that little town.</span> <span id="s201">And it was business always...relative for that time.</span> <span id="s202">The streets were not paved.</span> <span id="s203">They used to come at night, in the theatre with lanterns and the mud up til here, but they still came to the theatre.</span> <span id="s204">Because theatre was a part of Jewish culture.</span> <span id="s205">They couldn’t be without it.</span> <span id="s206">Not a comfort as the culture.</span> <span id="s207">The theatre was the culture.</span> <span id="s208">And they used to come, I remember...it written here the episode...that a big star from America, Mischa Fishsal...my son carries his name...came to a little town, and it was raining and it was muddy, and he couldn’t come here in his nice shoes and his nice coat, top hat, you know, the old time actors, and he couldn’t come to the theatre...the mud was up to the knees.</span> <span id="s209">So people came from the town and they made a little bench, how you say it, from their hands, like this, and he was sitting there and they were carrying him to the theatre to have the performance that night in the rain.</span> <span id="s210">Because this was life.</span> <span id="s211">This was real life.</span> <span id="s212">The working people, the younger people, how do you say it?</span> <span id="s213">the people who were dreaming for a better time, the younger ones, they were eating theatre.</span> <span id="s214">This was their life.</span> <span id="s215">This was their school.</span> <span id="s216">Theatre was their school.</span> <span id="s217">Because you took Yiddish literary things and put them on stage where they came and see these things they were learning.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">JF: What kind of subjects were the plays about?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">CA: It was from Y.

labor camps...It wasn’t then extermination camps and a lot of people from Vienna came to America and a lot of people came from Vienna went to Romania back, to Poland and to Romania, and then they came back from, in 1938 when we came...they came back to...I didn’t go over there to Czechoslovakia because the government said that I need a separate passport.</span> <span id="s472">Usually I traveled with the same passport as a minor and in that time they said that I am not a minor, I have to have my own passport.</span> <span id="s473">Why can’t I take my passport?</span> <span id="s474">I have to go back to Kishinev and take my passport there.</span> <span id="s475">So they were alone.</span> <span id="s476">I was already 17 or 18 years old and I went back, I spend with my aunt and tried to get a visa to get a passport and they didn’t want to give me anymore.</span> <span id="s477">They made a lot of problems to give me because I am a Jew, to give me a passport to travel, and I remember the night I went from...this was...a night before Purim.</span> <span id="s478">I will never forget it.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">JF: This was in 1938, now?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">CA: Yes.</span> <span id="s481">I came from...I tried to find a big lawyer, maybe he can make me a passport, a Romanian lawyer.</span> <span id="s482">If maybe he can make me a passport so I can be united with my parents.</span> <span id="s483">Going home from this lawyer, I saw in the streets...how you say?</span> <span id="s484">Groups of peasants, you know, groups, big groups of peasants from the villages, with how you call the things you work in the fields?</span> <span id="s485">Rakes and hoes, and pieces of wood, marching...they were preparing a big pogrom in that night.</span> <span id="s486">And I went home in the dark with my aunt, and I came home and we heard the radio saying that it’s preparing...and people started putting wooden pieces on the doors and covering up, and it was a terrible feeling that Kishinev was preparing itself for a big pogrom.</span> <span id="s487">And this was ‘38...the government, the head of the government of Romania was Cuza.</span> <span id="s488">Cuza was the head of the Iron Guardia...it’s called Garda de Fehrer [phonetic] in Romanian language...the Iron Guard of Nazis, with khaki uniforms, with brown bands on their hands...and they were walking on the streets with these villagers preparing the pogrom.</span> <span id="s489">And, because the head of the government...we had a king, but the head of the government was a Nazi...so in that night, the radio announced it that Cuza had a stroke and he is paralyzed and all his party and the government is falling apart...and the other day was Purim, and I still remember that the people, the Jews were dancing on the streets, that...because Cuza was called a Haman of Romanian...that God saved us from the other Haman like Cuza...</span></p> <p><span id="s490">JF: So the peasants stopped their movement because...</span></p> <p><span id="s491">CA: Because the party was like falling apart.</span> <span id="s492">They had to have orders from Bucharest what to do, and they didn’t do it.</span> <span id="s493">This was our salvation, but I still remember, making iron pieces on the doors, and all the family came together to grandfather’s house and there we closed up whatever we could, put things on the windows, and closing up the doors, and it was a silence in the streets all night because we didn’t...and like after midnight, and all the people was at to the radio, they were announcing what happened to Cuza and that is the party is falling apart and they are making...how you call it?</span> <span id="s494">Elections, fast elections, who will be take over because the King give an order right away to choose another party and to make something.</span> <span id="s495">This was that night and this I remember.</span> <span id="s496">My parents, in the same time announced us that they are were coming home from Czechoslovakia because the Germans are coming to take over, and they came home.</span> <span id="s497">This was ‘38 and then ‘38 or ‘39 they were still performing, as I said before, in the tea houses or the wine gardens.</span> <span id="s498">You know it is a garden, but they are serving wine in that places.</span> <span id="s499">In these places we were performing.</span> <span id="s500">And 1940, summer, we were performing, we were in Czernowitz, in another place, and we heard...the Russians came in and took over.</span> <span id="s501">One morning the Russians came in and took over, with no warning or nothing.</span> <span id="s502">No.</span> <span id="s503">Not at all.</span> <span id="s504">The first tank went to the prison, to open the gates of the prison to let out all of the political people there.</span> <span id="s505">The second tank goes straight to the city hall.</span> <span id="s506">This is the two ways.</span> <span id="s507">The first two tanks, prison and city hall.</span> <span id="s508">To take over a town, this is the way they are doing it.</span> <span id="s509">And my father said he doesn’t want to be in Bukovina, because he heard that this will be Ukraine.</span> <span id="s510">He wants to be in Kishinev, because we heard this will be Moldavia.</span> <span id="s511">So, we try to leave Czernowitz in 1940 and no train we could go on.</span> <span id="s512">Full of military people, full of peasants moving from place to place.</span> <span id="s513">It was a chaos.</span> <span id="s514">Do you say chaos in English?</span> <span id="s515">It was a chaos not to describe, so we rented a wagon with horses, we put whatever we had.</span> <span id="s516">I told you we didn’t have nothing specially, no furniture and so on.</span> <span id="s517">And we start, and in every town all the roads were closed with wagons, with horses, with wagons with how you say, not cows, oxen.</span> <span id="s518">People were moving from place to place thinking that they don’t want to be in Moldavia, they do not want to be in Ukraine, they don’t want to be there, and they start moving.</span> <span id="s519">And the roads were closed, no food, you cannot find nothing to eat, and I remember, start selling certain things to achieve us little food.</span> <span id="s520">It took us what has to take six hours by train, took us a week to achieve Kishinev, to arrive in Kishinev.</span> <span id="s521">It was there.</span> <span id="s522">In 1940 when the Russians took over Bessarabia, right away the stores were emptied out of food, clothing stores were emptied out from clothing, because the Russian people start coming over from there and buying out everything.</span> <span id="s523">I remember women used to buy nightgowns and put them on as dresses.</span> <span id="s524">When we saw the first time this kind of thing we couldn’t imagine, because the Russian people didn’t have nothing there on the other side.</span> <span id="s525">They used to come over and the new achieve taking over towns and take everything they found in the stores.</span> <span id="s526">Right away all the stores were empty.</span> <span id="s527">And there were lines.</span> <span id="s528">Standing in lines, you know, the usual way, what the Russians have, standing in lines.</span> <span id="s529">So, but one thing was good part of it for actors.</span> <span id="s530">They right away formed the Yiddish State Theatre.</span> <span id="s531">Moldavian Yiddish State Theatre, and my father and mother were taken in in this theatre, and it was a theatre, an ensemble of 120 people.</span> <span id="s532">Actors, actresses, dancers, make-up, painters, seamstresses.</span> <span id="s533">A state theatre, and a state theatre takes 120 people, it’s by the government.</span> <span id="s534">There’s a good part from one side, I mean the financial part of the thing.</span> <span id="s535">And an actor dreamt oh, here...I can without trouble, only have in mind my, I have only to give my talents, the rest the government will take care of me.</span> <span id="s536">But it wasn’t this way at all.</span> <span id="s537">They were dreaming that it would be this way.</span> <span id="s538">Because you cannot perform what you want, you cannot interpret a part like you would like to, because the director has to put on you the how to do it.</span> <span id="s539">To be in the line of the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">JF: The director was, then, not a native?</span></p> <p><span id="s541">CA: No.</span> <span id="s542">He was usually a Russian.</span> <span id="s543">Right away we got one from Odessa, and after that we had one from, a non-Jew from Ukraine, that he put on the shows.</span> <span id="s544">We had one from Romania.</span> <span id="s545">What we know that in his young years he was a Communist, but a very good writer and director.</span> <span id="s546">So, then, it...for him, he was allowed to put on a revue or other little things, but usually they sent over directors from...and they sent even Jewish actors from Russia.</span> <span id="s547">They didn’t have anymore theatres anymore too much in Russia.</span> <span id="s548">So they took their actors from Leningrad, like four, I remember, from Kiev, two, from different towns and they send it over to Moldavia to the new formed theatre.</span> <span id="s549">Because they didn’t have Yiddish theatre in Russia.</span> <span id="s550">It was only one big theatre in Moscow.</span> <span id="s551">It was one in Odessa and it was only in K'harkov and the rest actors didn’t have jobs so they took them and send them over to the new acquired territory.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">JF: How many of these state theatres were set up in the newly acquired territories?</span> <span id="s553">Just the one?</span></p> <p><span id="s554">CA: Two, one in Czernowitz because this was the province of Bukovina but they attached to Ukraine, and one in Kishinev what was called the Moldavian Yiddish Theatre.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Tape two, side one:</span></p> <p><span

theatre.</span> <span id="s561">This was the first thing.</span> <span id="s562">Everyone had the feeling that he has to watch the next one.</span> <span id="s563">You know, like it’s usually.</span> <span id="s564">They used to call people and the head of the theatre to call people, actors, saying, “How was the other actor?</span> <span id="s565">Is he good, is he talking about something?”</span> <span id="s566">, is he... Always, like...wanting to take out, to find out how they’re behaving, how they are doing.</span> <span id="s567">This is like it’s a way of...you feel always watched, you feel always that somebody is watching and it may be that the other person is called and asked what is doing the other one.</span> <span id="s568">You know what it means, the atmosphere in general?</span></p> <p><span id="s569">JF: The suspicion?</span></p> <p><span id="s570">CA: The suspicion.</span> <span id="s571">To find out, because it’s a new formed theatre, to find out what everyone what is thinking, what is doing, always the way.</span> <span id="s572">The second one, it was restricted...let’s say, you have to be very careful to give an idea about a show, what couldn’t find grace in their eyes.</span> <span id="s573">You had to do the show they want.</span> <span id="s574">You have to interpret the part...if you said this way you say, “Tch, tch, tch.”</span> <span id="s575">This is not thinking the right way.</span> <span id="s576">You had to do it this way.</span> <span id="s577">They forced us to bring out in every show the social problem, if it wasn’t one.</span> <span id="s578">We had to interpret it in such a way that it is one.</span> <span id="s579">You talked to your...like you always had...the tone to the balabos and the balabosta as to be in such a way like, asking for your social rights, or whatever it is.</span> <span id="s580">And this was, for an actor who performs for the sake of art, for performing, it was a very hard thing to do.</span> <span id="s581">To think politics in the time that you are rehearsing, the time that you are doing...in a show if a scene was, if a scene was in a factory of talesim, a guy is killed, they are making a strike and he is killed.</span> <span id="s582">They want to bring in the whole talis soaked in blood, that this is what the rich people did.</span> <span id="s583">Overdone, really overdone.</span> <span id="s584">The interpretation had to be overdone.</span> <span id="s585">And this, the actors didn’t like it at all.</span> <span id="s586">Mostly in the beginning, you know, it was a terrible thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">JF: Did they also eliminate certain plays?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">CA: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">JF: Which kind?</span></p> <p><span id="s590">CA: They eliminate plays that they have religious contents.</span> <span id="s591">They would eliminate a play that looks positive on, let’s say, on a owner of a factory.</span> <span id="s592">Even if the play has an owner of a factory.</span> <span id="s593">If he has positive sides, they would take it away.</span> <span id="s594">The play couldn’t go any more.</span> <span id="s595">They wouldn’t allow certain writers.</span> <span id="s596">Like we used to perform from before...</span></p> <p><span id="s597">JF: Which kinds of writers?</span></p> <p><span id="s598">CA: Writers, they were typical, really Jewish culture.</span> <span id="s599">Like a lot of plays from Mendele Mocher Seforim.</span> <span id="s600">Y.

up and working with the girls and boys together singing when we were working, it’s a different atmosphere than seeing old actors and actresses doing labor on the fields where they never, they wouldn’t dream about it, they don’t know it.</span> <span id="s895">And second, first one, their bodies, even, is no use for this kind of physical work, but some of them died and some of them

had bread.</span> <span id="s909">This was the most important thing.</span> <span id="s910">We didn’t have a lot of things to the bread, but bread we had.</span> <span id="s911">A loaf of bread was given to everyone on the field when he was working.</span> <span id="s912">If somebody didn’t go to work he didn’t get a bread.</span> <span id="s913">So, let’s say if somebody didn’t go, he was sick...people used to share the piece of bread with that person.</span> <span id="s914">We had sometimes...we had luck, my family.</span> <span id="s915">Father was riding on the horse around the farm and early in the morning when the girls start milking the cows they gave, when they made the butter, from the churn, they used their hands to clean out the remnants, and put them in a little dish and

they gave us again a train with tanks what are coming back to the front for repair.</span> <span id="s942">So in this platforms were tanks, what they’re working, but they can shoot, the cannons on the top are working, but the motors for the thing itself is not working.</span> <span id="s943">So they were sent back for repair.</span> <span id="s944">So we were...who could catch, some people in one wagon and some in the other one, and we were on this wagon.</span> <span id="s945">And on the wagons were hay, you know, straw, and the tanks on the top, and we used to sleep...I used to sleep under

the garden outside from the station.</span> <span id="s963">They were in lice.</span> <span id="s964">Everywhere you look you see lice.</span> <span id="s965">You can see them going on the benches.</span> <span id="s966">It’s because people were dressed up with everything they had sometimes.</span> <span id="s967">And it was...arriving only on the station.</span> <span id="s968">So we found out that in Tashkent our government would pay us what it owes for the last month we worked in Kishinev, but the theatre doesn’t exist anymore, everybody can go and do whatever they want.</span> <span id="s969">My father decided that we would go to a kolkhoz.</span> <span id="s970">Because we didn’t have hunger in kolkhoz in Ukraine.</span> <span id="s971">He was thinking that in kolkhoz we

came in this kolkhoz, they sent us on the fields to take down the frozen cotton.</span> <span id="s982">You know cotton isn’t closed up.</span> <span id="s983">Summertime from the sun they open up, they open, so you can pick the cotton.</span> <span id="s984">You have a sack in front of you and you pick the cotton, and you put them in the sack.</span> <span id="s985">But when the cold starts a little earlier, this doesn’t open up.</span> <span id="s986">You have to take them down like they are.</span> <span id="s987">They are dried in special rooms with heat, and you open by hand and take down the cotton.</span> <span id="s988">And this was the work they put in this kolkhoz, all the refugees.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">JF: About how many of you stayed together to go to this

general, you find it today, too, are very selfish.</span> <span id="s1007">This is because...I don’t blame them...because of survival.</span> <span id="s1008">Because of survival, they will talk on their neighbor.</span> <span id="s1009">Because of survival they will steal.</span> <span id="s1010">Because of survival they don’t give a damn of another Jew.</span> <span id="s1011">Because this is the reason Jews from...Russian Jews that are coming today, the newcomers, they have to change their attitude against Jews.</span> <span id="s1012">The Jews from Russia what are here in America, they don’t mind what happened to a Jew in Russia back.</span> <span id="s1013">They don’t mind.</span> <span id="s1014">They wouldn’t give a penny for...the same money that brought them, they wouldn’t help

Yiddish school and she said the school closed up, not because...the government there did not close certain institutions.</span> <span id="s1038">They are warning the people who are going to the

id="s1056">They have a form of suppressing things so you don’t...not to blame them.</span> <span id="s1057">If you remember, you saw the movie “Holocaust.”</span> <span id="s1058">Like the Germans look the way, so for the world, it looks legally, the things they did.</span> <span id="s1059">This is the way of looking, a way out for the world, for the correspondents, newspaper men will look at

water than soup, but this is the way it goes.</span> <span id="s1068">And a refugee in Russia, you could see him on the waistline near his belt...This container, with a spoon always tied down here, not to lose it, and we used to make the containers from tin cans.</span> <span id="s1069">This was the containers and this was the symbol of a refugee, having a container or something, a spoon tied down here, because if you came in a cafeteria style place, the spoons were tied down to the table because people used to take the spoons with them.</span> <span id="s1070">So this is the way...usually we always, it’s in our mind, will always be the tin container with the spoon.</span> <span id="s1071">We always carried around with us.</span> <span id="s1072">And I never believed that exists a world

putting them away and he lets the refugees starve.</span> <span id="s1091">So I decided I have to go to the head of the county or whatever it is, like City Hall, and tell the truth, what is going on.</span> <span id="s1092">But I will never return to the cooperative again.</span> <span id="s1093">I was afraid because I want to tell what’s going on.</span> <span id="s1094">So I went there with

Russia, a president of the kolkhoz, he takes away, we found out, he takes away and he has a hole in the hut, in the ground, and he puts the sacks in and then he makes big parties and they are drinking with all the, with people, they were roasting a lamb, and making pilaf, (you know like in Asia they are doing it) and we were hungry.”</span> <span id="s1096">And I found it out, and I told them, but we decided we didn’t go back.</span> <span id="s1097">Because we don’t know, maybe he will take revenge on us, or it will be bad for our families, whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">JF: And your

everything.</span> <span id="s1106">A lot of suicides between men, not women at all.</span> <span id="s1107">Is what happened in that time.</span> <span id="s1108">They didn’t see a way out.</span>

stuffing and I had to watch my mother, yellow from malaria, standing and stuffing this.</span> <span id="s1183">She stole a white sack from cotton, she put it around her body in the toilet, and she went out because every factory in the wartime had security with arms, because everything was, everything for the front.</span> <span id="s1184">Everything for the war.</span> <span

from work on the fields.</span> <span id="s1240">Some I was...in the hospital, at least, I’ll have a bed, because in Asia we slept on the floor.</span> <span id="s1241">They don’t sleep on beds, they don’t eat on tables.</span> <span id="s1242">Usually they sleep only on the floor.</span> <span id="s1243">They have a lot of blankets, quilted blankets, and they are sleeping on them.</span> <span

beginning, I mean, they respected us, European.</span> <span id="s1250">They considered themselves Mongolian, Asians.</span> <span id="s1251">They respected us very, very much.</span> <span

reason for that.”</span> <span id="s1256">They start introducing the hate they got on the fronts.</span> <span id="s1257">They start looking differently.</span> <span id="s1258">Even, I remember, an expression from a young Uzbek, because I learned, I spoke beautiful Uzbek language.</span> <span id="s1259">I learned it fast and I forgot it very fast.</span> <span id="s1260">And they used to, I remember...he said [to] us: “Why do they say in Germany that every Jew has a long nose?”</span> <span id="s1261">Stupid questions, but they came already with the poison inside them, because they were together with the soldiers there, on the fronts from Germany, even the population from Ukraine was hating Jews.</span> <span id="s1262">To being with the Ukrainian people together, Uzbek with the Ukrainian soldiers and other soldiers...Some came back from the hospital, some was wounded, and they had inside all the seeds of antisemitism.</span> <span id="s1263">This started approximate ‘43, middle ‘43, after the Russians start throwing them back from Stalingrad.</span> <span id="s1264">There was a big battle of ‘43 from Stalingrad and the Russians start going back, throwing back the

you know the Uzbeks, are still like the Islam.</span> <span id="s1274">Their religion was Islam before the Russians came in, I mean.</span> <span id="s1275">They still have the mosques...but this is the way.</span> <span id="s1276">The door is always open.</span> <span id="s1277">If a stranger passes by, he can come in, and if they are eating in that time, they ask him to the table.</span> <span

a lot of Jews, the marrying kind, you know what I mean.</span> <span id="s1387">And he was the only one there, a good worker, a Stakhanovist, one who makes more than the norm.</span> <span

a child in Poland.</span> <span id="s1391">And then we met, we said to each other, “If your wife and child survives, you are free to decide whatever you want to do.</span> <span id="s1392">At least now we are together.”</span> <span id="s1393">Why did we say that?</span> <span id="s1394">In that time, in 1942, it was formed an army from Polish citizens in Russia to go and fight on the Polish territory against the Germans.</span> <span id="s1395">It was called Polska Armya.</span> <span id="s1396">So a lot of them went to the fronts, and a lot of them, after, if they were wounded, they were in the hospitals in Russia, so they brought the news that the Jews were killed, ovens, concentration camps, not the direct ovens like we knew later on.</span> <span id="s1397">That the Jewish population were killed by the Nazis.</span> <span id="s1398">My ex-husband had a family with seven brothers.</span> <span id="s1399">Nobody’s alive.</span> <span id="s1400">Absolutely nobody.</span> <span id="s1401">And he said, he told us, the [unclear] told us what is going on there.</span> <span id="s1402">So, then, we decided that if his wife or his child will survive, after the war, or somebody will be...because my ex-husband always dreamt that his child is somewhere living among non-Jews.</span> <span id="s1403">So, when we come back after the war, I was the one to look in the newspapers, to look in organizations, to ask in churches, maybe because he was, five years old, I think, four or five years old that little boy when he left...And he left because their father...their town was occupied by the Nazis in Poland.</span> <span id="s1404">And, they cut away his beard together with a piece of his flesh of his face.</span> <span id="s1405">He was an old man, he went too early to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s1406">So, he took all his sons and he gave them a wagon and he said, “You have to run away.”</span> <span id="s1407">Old people and children and women they wouldn’t do nothing, so all the brothers run away, but they were on the border and they didn’t let them cross to the Russians.</span> <span id="s1408">Everybody went back to their families and they were killed by the Germans.</span> <span id="s1409">Only one, my husband, only son what came other side and survived.</span> <span id="s1410">He is still alive.</span> <span id="s1411">He’s in Israel.</span> <span id="s1412">The father of my son.</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">JF: He snuck over the border?</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">CA: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">JF: His name

more or less, we knew.</span> <span id="s1422">The Jews were killed.</span> <span id="s1423">In the concentration camps, labor camps, but nobody knew about extermination camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">JF: Not until after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">CA: Because labor camps were in Russia too.</span> <span id="s1426">We knew that they concentrated Jews, because we knew even in ‘32, ‘33, ‘34, they had concentration camps in Germany.</span> <span id="s1427">We knew about concentration camps in all the territories they occupied, but nobody knew about extermination.</span> <span id="s1428">If somebody died, or he was killed, or because he was against Nazism, he was a communist, you know, or he died because of sickness or starvation...but nobody knew about extermination camps, about the gasses, and about this kind...nobody knew about that until we came back from Russia to Poland.</span> <span id="s1429">Thanks to that, that my ex-husband was Polish citizen, we could go...leave Russia, as an exchange of citizens.</span> <span id="s1430">After the war, Russia made an exchange.</span> <span id="s1431">All Russians on the territory there came back and all the Polish people in the Russian territory was sent back if he wants.</span> <span id="s1432">Back to Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">JF: And you were included in that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">CA: I was included because I was married to him.</span> <span id="s1435">I usually, after the wedding, when I married him, I still used my averbuch maiden name, but, when we found out that Polish people can leave, I right away changed my name in his name so we could leave the country.</span> <span id="s1436">And I took my mother with me too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">JF: Let’s back up for a

town.</span> <span id="s1447">He was an auto mechanic.</span> <span id="s1448">He worked as an auto mechanic.</span> <span id="s1449">And I tell you what I [unclear].</span> <span id="s1450">They found out that I know to write and read Russian language, so they took me out from the sewing department and they put me on a department what builded...how you call it?</span> <span id="s1451">metallurgic factory, to where they are making steel.</span> <span id="s1452">Steel factory, how you call it?</span> <span id="s1453">It is not called factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">JF: Mill.</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">CA: Yes, steel mill.</span> <span id="s1456">I became their clerk, all of a sudden, knowing Russian language, they made me a clerk.</span> <span id="s1457">Because in this five years, I was there, ‘41, ‘45, a little less, went through so many trades, and so many things, you know, that I sometimes say, “only two months I was this, only two months I was that.”</span> <span id="s1458">You cannot imagine what it is.</span> <span id="s1459">And I was, how you call it, a clerk.</span> <span id="s1460">This clerk means...how would you call somebody who checks the working people out on their jobs?</span> <span id="s1461">This is a job in Russia.</span> <span id="s1462">You go around with a book with names, finding out if the people are on their jobs.</span> <span id="s1463">If they are not on their jobs, you are to find out where they are.</span> <span id="s1464">If they are sick, they have to bring a paper from the doctor.</span> <span id="s1465">If they are not sick, they are declared deserters.</span> <span id="s1466">Because, the whole life in Russia and the war was a front.</span> <span id="s1467">And if you didn’t come for three-four days to your job, if you came with a certain paper or whatever it is, then I had to make a report as a deserter.</span> <span id="s1468">This was my job.</span> <span id="s1469">So, I went on the rails from the train what were carrying this steel and checking on more than 2,000 people if they are on their jobs.</span> <span id="s1470">And I used to tell them...it was so hard for me to make a report as a deserter, I could die.</span> <span id="s1471">How can I write such a thing?</span> <span id="s1472">I used to tell them, “If you have to do something, if you have to go in market to sell your cow, because there was Uzbek people working there, if your wife is pregnant and you want to help, you got, whatever you have to do, tell me.</span> <span id="s1473">Tell me, so, if the head will ask me, where is this and this and this, I can say he asked permission he’s there and there.</span> <span id="s1474">Not leave your job without saying what you are doing, where you are.</span> <span id="s1475">If no, I have to make a declaration as a deserter.”</span> <span id="s1476">So the Uzbeks loved me enormously, and I start living up, in what sense?</span> <span id="s1477">One Uzbek brought me a dozen eggs, one Uzbek peasant brought me, like a little handkerchief, a little rice or whatever it is.</span> <span id="s1478">You know...it was...and this helped me a lot.</span> <span id="s1479">Then came the time that I married my...he was a mechanic on this mill.</span> <span id="s1480">An auto mechanic.</span> <span id="s1481">Because, I could think about such a thing.</span> <span id="s1482">Because, I wasn’t hungry anymore, like I was before.</span> <span id="s1483">And I start meeting with this, and I start preparing groups for amateur, for performing.</span> <span id="s1484">Why did it?</span> <span id="s1485">Because they used to give...they didn’t pay for that, but they give a, how you call it?</span> <span id="s1486">a prize, a premium, three yards of fabric, a pair of American shoes.</span> <span id="s1487">They got from America for the army, soldier shoes.</span> <span id="s1488">So, if I want a prize, they gave me a pair

send Russian refugees there.</span> <span id="s1518">They sent their actors from, from...I mean good actors from Moscow, Leningrad or K’harkov.</span> <span id="s1519">They were groups like you send

Russia?</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">CA: It wasn’t...it didn’t exist.</span> <span id="s1522">It wasn’t.</span> <span id="s1523">In that years they...Moscow, even the government, the actors of Moscow was in Tashkent.</span> <span id="s1524">They had, sometimes, concerts on single basis.</span> <span id="s1525">I know some actors who stayed in Tashkent worked with a show or two from time to time, semi-professional.</span> <span id="s1526">The government didn’t gave them all the support.</span> <span id="s1527">Something that is there to make for the people.</span> <span id="s1528">But this happened in a big town like Tashkent.</span> <span id="s1529">Tashkent is like the Moscow of Middle Asia, what is there.</span> <span id="s1530">And we didn’t dream about playing, performing, where I was, but in ‘43...Why?</span> <span id="s1531">I got three yards of Japanese silk because they had Japanese prisoners of war in there, and they used me...I understood Italian a little bit, because on this mill, what I said, steel mill, they started bringing in ‘43 prisoners from Germany and from Italy.</span> <span id="s1532">I know Romanian language, I understood very well Italian.</span> <span id="s1533">I know German perfectly.</span> <span id="s1534">So they start using me to translate from the prisoners.</span> <span id="s1535">From the prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s1536">[unclear] The worst prisoners were the Japanese prisoners.</span> <span id="s1537">They chose always death instead of working for the Russians.</span> <span id="s1538">They were very...they used to kill themselves, they were put in wagons to go to work, they used to throw themselves out of the trains.</span> <span id="s1539">It was an honorable death.</span> <span id="s1540">you know the honorable death?</span> <span id="s1541">And every Japanese had silk on his body, certain amount of five or six yards, meters, I don’t know, of silk...Because when you bury a Japanese, he’s buried in this silk.</span> <span id="s1542">So, start coming on the market in Russia, Japanese silk.</span> <span id="s1543">All of a sudden, we had Japanese silk, how much you want.</span> <span id="s1544">Because, if the Japanese died, the Russians buried them without their silk.</span> <span id="s1545">The silk came on the market.</span> <span id="s1546">And, I remember, I had a dress from three yards, I bought in the market, three yards of black silk with a little flower and I made myself a dress.</span> <span id="s1547">There was...every day, every day a person for what survived the war could write a book.</span> <span id="s1548">Because in the morning it’s not the same like in the middle of the day, and the night not the same as in the morning, and the next day

closer to Germany.</span> <span id="s1552">And the life start to be a little easier even in Russia.</span> <span id="s1553">Only first, maybe we got used, maybe we learned what to do to survive.</span> <span id="s1554">Second one, we got all the time news what was going on there in Germany and we were thinking, “We are poor, we are hungry, but at least we survived.</span> <span id="s1555">Who knows what is better.”</span> <span id="s1556">All kinds of things in the head.</span> <span id="s1557">And everybody start living with the idea: maybe the war will soon be finished.</span> <span id="s1558">You come back and you will find somebody from your families, from your relatives.</span> <span id="s1559">And this way of thinking makes your life a little bit easier too.</span> <span id="s1560">So, in ‘45 when we heard that the war finished and the Russians are in the lead...</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">JF: At this time, you were still in the same town?</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">CA: Same town.</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">JF: And your mother at this point was with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">CA: Mother was with me.</span></p>

he had died, somebody came from I told you before, Margeland, they came to me and said...and I said, “How’s my daddy doing?”</span> <span id="s1568">And they say, “What do you mean?</span> <span id="s1569">You don’t know that he is dead?”</span> <span id="s1570">Not to announce!</span> <span id="s1571">They knew where the family is.</span> <span id="s1572">Not to say, not to announce, not to let..., nothing.</span> <span id="s1573">Nothing.</span> <span id="s1574">He disappeared one night, then I had to...I went there and I found out that there were 50 people in one grave, in one hole, with this antiseptic on the top, covered up without even a stone, with nothing.</span> <span id="s1575">This is the way my father is there, is somewhere.</span> <span id="s1576">This is a lot, a lot later.</span> <span id="s1577">And, really, when the war finished, we start thinking, “How we are going out?”</span> <span id="s1578">They could keep us here forever.</span> <span id="s1579">Because we had no connection with the government.</span> <span id="s1580">For this kind of asking, “When do they let me go?”</span> <span id="s1581">“What do you mean go?</span> <span id="s1582">You stay here until.”</span> <span id="s1583">You cannot ask even such questions of the government: “You want to go back.”</span> <span id="s1584">But all of a sudden, we found out that it’s an exchange of citizens going on.</span> <span id="s1585">From the other towns we found out.</span> <span id="s1586">And it was the head of Polish government.</span> <span id="s1587">Polish people don’t let other nations to go over that.</span> <span id="s1588">How you say?</span> <span id="s1589">to boss over them.</span> <span id="s1590">Because, when all the Polish people arrived in Russia, and the Russians want to give them passports, they didn’t want to accept them, if you heard about it.</span> <span id="s1591">They took only permanent, six-monthly, and to renew every six months, because they didn’t accept the Russian citizenship.</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">JF: This is what your husband...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">CA: Yes, they didn’t accept citizenship.</span> <span id="s1594">A lot of them went to Siberia, a lot were sent away in the forests, or other things, but when the war started they were let out from the prisons, because...the Polish people got passports, Russian passports in 1939, they start giving them, when Germany occupied half and the Russians got half.</span> <span id="s1595">So, a lot of Polish people were sent to prisons, to labor camps, and then they were freed.</span> <span id="s1596">As soon as the war started, [the invasion of Russia], the Polish people were freed.</span> <span id="s1597">They start working, that’s the way my husband was.</span> <span id="s1598">And...so they heard...the Polish people start talking to the Russians of exchanging.</span> <span id="s1599">It didn’t came from the Polish people who are in Russia: it came from the Polish people from Poland.</span> <span id="s1600">For an exchange.</span> <span id="s1601">So, we went and registered.</span> <span id="s1602">But you had to wait and they will give to your disposition a train.</span> <span id="s1603">So, we were waiting for months.</span> <span id="s1604">It was already ‘45, October or November, that they said that Begovat got a train to load the refugees.</span> <span id="s1605">So we were again in this kind of wagons, in this train...You call it wagon?</span> <span id="s1606">How you call it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">JF: The train car.</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">CA: The train car.</span> <span id="s1609">In a train car, what they are usually using for cattle.</span> <span id="s1610">In the middle a little oven, iron oven, and all the people inside, and we were traveling one month to the Polish border.</span> <span id="s1611">They put us away for weeks on the dead line.</span> <span id="s1612">People didn’t have what to eat, they start again, running in town, buying something.</span> <span id="s1613">And do you know what many murders was?</span> <span id="s1614">Jewish people went down in the little villages, Ukrainian villages on the road, to buy food and they didn’t came back.</span> <span id="s1615">They killed them there.</span> <span id="s1616">We found out later on.</span> <span id="s1617">The same thing happened on the Polish territory.</span> <span id="s1618">When we went over the border, we had a paper, half Polish, half Russian, and when we came to the border, they came on the train, they cut apart the two pieces.</span> <span id="s1619">We got the Polish part, they took away the Russian part, and we went over the border on the Polish side.</span> <span id="s1620">And the train brought us in small villages.</span> <span id="s1621">And, again, the same thing.</span> <span id="s1622">On the way, some people, I know a musician, a trumpetist, a fantastic trumpetist, went down into town to buy something and he was killed.</span> <span id="s1623">It’s fact, he left his wife and children in the train.</span> <span id="s1624">They had to continue their journey without father.</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">JF: Not knowing what had happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">CA: Some people told us.</span> <span id="s1627">They were the Polish partisans, who, after the war still were going around in the forest and the fields and this and killing Jews.</span> <span id="s1628">And these were people that were called AKA.</span> <span id="s1629">I don’t even know what it means, shortening of words.</span> <span id="s1630">But I remember they were called AKAists.</span></p> <p><span id="s1631">JF: What initials?</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">CA: AKA, I would say.</span>

id="s1639">When we came to the Polish territory we found out that a lot of pogroms, a lot of things are going on against Jews.</span> <span id="s1640">Because if a Jew came to a little town, asking, making a little searching for his family, for his house, he grew up in.</span> <span id="s1641">If he were good, some people, it happened, they got scared.</span> <span id="s1642">“Look, he survived!</span> <span id="s1643">What happened?”</span> <span id="s1644">And they didn’t do nothing.</span> <span id="s1645">Some were afraid that he will take away...there were already Polish people living in his house, or having their factory or having their business, so, they often, they were killed.</span> <span id="s1646">They never could go.</span> <span id="s1647">And everyone felt, on the territory of Poland, that they could never stay there.</span> <span id="s1648">It’s like only a transit.</span> <span id="s1649">They would like to find out what happened and go away.</span> <span id="s1650">Nobody, at least, the old ones in the train with us, had at least in their mind to come back home and continue their life in Poland.</span> <span id="s1651">Nobody.</span> <span id="s1652">Some of them who were communistically inclined, and other things, or they got a big job, or their wives were not Jewish, and maybe they survived in Russia or in the war because they were saved from non-Jewish girls...They found their families and they didn’t want to continue further, so they stayed in Poland.</span> <span id="s1653">A lot of them stayed in Poland.</span> <span id="s1654">And then, they left later on through the years, a lot of them are in America, a lot of them Australia, and other places.</span> <span id="s1655">But, it was very hard, I remember, my ex-husband used to say, “Every Jew feels like the earth is burning under their feet.”</span> <span id="s1656">They couldn’t...it wasn’t possible.</span> <span id="s1657">To go around, you could move over in another town.</span> <span id="s1658">Most of the people moved over to the territory what Germany gave to Poland.</span> <span id="s1659">It’s called Silesia.</span> <span id="s1660">And all Poland took over Silesia.</span> <span id="s1661">It’s a part of Germany.</span> <span id="s1662">So, I lived in [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s1663">JF: So, this is the area where you...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">CA: Yes, in Silesia.</span> <span id="s1665">I lived in Silesia.</span> <span id="s1666">Nobody wants to say Poland.</span> <span id="s1667">Nobody stayed in Warsaw, Lodz.</span> <span id="s1668">And this everybody moved over to Silesia.</span> <span id="s1669">Like a bridge from there to go away.</span> <span id="s1670">And everyone who left with the Bricha, on their way to Israel, comes from Silesia.</span> <span id="s1671">Because from there it was very close, Innsbruck, from Innsbruck to Italy to Israel.</span> <span id="s1672">This was the route that everybody dreamt about it.</span> <span id="s1673">I became a secretary of Poale Zion T.

the same time, it was in a town in Poland, Kielce.</span> <span id="s1691">It’s called Kielce, it was a big pogrom.</span> <span id="s1692">All complex of Jews who lived together, who came back from Russia who survived, from the Partisans, from Russia, or they were in the Aryan part, with Polish documents, as a Jew who survived, they were killed.</span> <span id="s1693">As a pogrom, officially pogrom, it’s called the Kielce pogrom.</span> <span id="s1694">This was already in the beginning of 1946.</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">JF: What was different about this area in Silesia that attracted these people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1696">CA: It was a mixture of Polish and more Germans.</span> <span id="s1697">And German people felt very down, very down.</span> <span

moved away four fingers.</span> <span id="s1790">This is the way the doctor showed me.</span> <span id="s1791">Four fingers on the side, and I couldn’t give...this he said is from hard labor.</span> <span id="s1792">And I knew, because I worked in the fields and I carried cases with 60, 70 kilograms heaviness, so I was treating [?]</span> <span id="s1793">myself.</span> <span id="s1794">I said the only thing to make good, feel us peace [?]</span> <span id="s1795">, after my family died is to have a child.</span> <span id="s1796">And when I become pregnant, I said to my husband, “Or now, or who knows, never,” because I am afraid of my baby.</span> <span id="s1797">And we left in the middle of the night with another group, like we used to arrange, in the middle of the night only a rucksack, bedsack you call it, five pair of panties and two slips and fifth blouses...whatever we could to pass the border from Poland to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1798">And when we arrived in Czechoslovakia was waiting certain people for us.</span> <span id="s1799">I walked through Czechoslovakia until Bratislava.</span> <span id="s1800">Walked.</span> <span id="s1801">You know?</span> <span id="s1802">And from Bratislava we had to go through Vienna.</span> <span id="s1803">You know, to Vienna.</span> <span id="s1804">Vienna was separated in four zones.</span> <span id="s1805">And we want the American zone.</span> <span id="s1806">So, we had to pass the Russian zone.</span> <span id="s1807">So people who had children put tape on their mouths, and at night we were going like this on hills, because down the hills there were the patrols of Soviet soldiers.</span> <span id="s1808">And if they are catching you they are sending you back to Russia.</span> <span id="s1809">So we had to go this little...we arrived and I had my mother.</span> <span id="s1810">Only she wasn’t so young anymore, and I remember she was...I was afraid I would lose her.</span> <span id="s1811">And when we came on the other side of the hill, we had reflectors, light waiting for us.</span> <span id="s1812">The Bricha, the Israeli guys were waiting for us.</span> <span id="s1813">And they put us in a camp in...from Vienna to Linz.</span> <span id="s1814">In Linz, on the American Zone...this was a concentration camp in the German time, and a refugee camp after the war.</span> <span id="s1815">There you were considered a D.P., displaced person, with cards from the American Zone that we are displaced persons.</span> <span id="s1816">There I gave birth to my daughter.</span> <span id="s1817">And when she was three months old...</span></p> <p><span id="s1818">JF: This was nineteen forty...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1819">CA: Eight.</span></p> <p><span id="s1820">JF: Eight.</span></p> <p><span id="s1821">CA: In April, right in the beginning.</span> <span id="s1822">They found out that my daughter has a hole in her heart, and until today...this is the first time I say it in the tape, I never talked to her [perhaps she means she’s never talked to her daughter about this]...maybe the reason that we walked 25 miles I don’t remember 45 miles to Czechoslovakia... I walked.</span> <span id="s1823">Secondly, the scare I had in my heart going on this mountain wall through Vienna, that she was born with a defect.</span> <span id="s1824">She doesn’t know that.</span> <span id="s1825">I say, something I went through in the time I was pregnant.</span> <span id="s1826">Something terrible went through.</span> <span id="s1827">We were afraid they would send us back, you know, and this was something terrible.</span> <span id="s1828">Everybody was really scared to death.</span> <span id="s1829">Only to see us over this mountain.</span> <span id="s1830">And when we came to other side, this was fantastic.</span> <span id="s1831">We still lived in a barrack, it was not luxury, but we get food from the UNRRA and the Joint sended clothing and something to eat, and then ‘48, May, the independence of Israel was declared.</span> <span id="s1832">And in August, ‘48, I took a bedsack with a pillow inside, nothing, no clothing, nothing, a pillow with my little baby in my hands, and I went through the mountains, through Innsbruck, walking again through Italy...Italy...on every station were waiting Jewish people with fruits, with bread, waiting for these trains with refugees.</span> <span id="s1833">Then from there we took a boat.</span> <span id="s1834">An Italian boat, Campidoglio...I’ll remember it till my death.</span> <span id="s1835">I had papers with my husband with the name Rabinowitch and the baby in my pillow was a little boy.</span> <span id="s1836">But it was a girl, but on my false documents I had a little boy.</span> <span id="s1837">Who would open up and see four month baby if it’s...and they told us if the British are stopping in the middle on the Mediterranean, don’t speak any Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1838">They know that this ship has Greek Jews who survived.</span> <span id="s1839">You can talk only with your hands.</span> <span id="s1840">And we arrived at night to Jaffa.</span> <span id="s1841">They took us by little boats to the shore and they put us again in a camp.</span> <span id="s1842">Tent camp.</span> <span id="s1843">I was in this tent camp for four months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1844">JF: In Jaffa?</span></p> <p><span id="s1845">CA: No, in Ranaana.</span> <span id="s1846">Jaffa was they port.</span> <span id="s1847">But in the same night when we arrived, they took away my husband to the war, in the army.</span> <span id="s1848">This is...I mean the beginning of a better time.</span> <span id="s1849">It was very bad then in 1948, we still had the ration cards for food.</span> <span id="s1850">We were in a tent with the jackals around, hyenas around.</span> <span id="s1851">We had the laughing hyenas around this place.</span> <span id="s1852">But I was all the time with my little one in my hands, because the doctor said, “If she will live a year, you have to say ‘thank you’ to God.”</span> <span id="s1853">And she is now a mother of two sons.</span> <span id="s1854">She went through surgery at the University of Pennsylvania.</span></p> <p><span id="s1855">JF: And the hole was repaired?</span></p> <p><span id="s1856">CA: Dacron patch.</span> <span id="s1857">They put on her hole on her heart.</span> <span id="s1858">And she is a Hebrew teacher now, she’s a fantastic woman, lady, daughter.</span> <span id="s1859">I can say she is really a down-to-earth person, and my other kids the same thing.</span> <span id="s1860">They are fantastic good kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s1861">JF: Now, you lived in Israel, then, for how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s1862">CA: Almost 15 years.</span> <span id="s1863">My son is born in Israel.</span> <span id="s1864">The only one that was not born in Israel is my daughter, the one.</span> <span id="s1865">My son was born in Haifa.</span> <span id="s1866">And, we went through...we couldn’t...we left Ranaana, and they send us to Akko.</span> <span id="s1867">It was a town occupied by...it was empty, the Arabs run away, because if somebody says that the Israelis pushed out the Arabs from the country, I am the first to say, maybe not the first, but I say that that is not true.</span> <span id="s1868">I saw with my own eyes one Arab shooting a neighbor because he doesn’t want to run away.</span> <span id="s1869">They forced one for the, “Let us go away, we soon come back, and take over again.”</span> <span id="s1870">This was the mentality.</span> <span id="s1871">They left all of the villages, towns, houses, they were free, they were empty.</span> <span id="s1872">Nobody was there, so when a lot of Jewish refugees came in they occupied these houses, and they lived in them.</span> <span id="s1873">This was the occupation.</span> <span id="s1874">Not because they occupied Israel.</span> <span id="s1875">It’s a different way because I know that.</span> <span id="s1876">I came to a woman from Greece and we told her, “Look, the house will be taken away by the government because nobody is living in that.</span> <span id="s1877">If you give us a room to stay, us being there nobody will touch you.”</span> <span id="s1878">Because, if a house stays empty, and people live on the streets and in tents, they have to occupy to put the people in, because right away they took the men away in war.</span> <span id="s1879">They have to put their wives and kids somewhere.</span> <span id="s1880">So this was the way of exchanging, of putting the refugees in houses.</span> <span id="s1881">They were freed from people that run away from the country.</span> <span id="s1882">That’s the whole idea.</span> <span id="s1883">They used to go with armored cars, brought bread to the people in the houses, because people were afraid to go out buying bread.</span> <span id="s1884">There was Arabs in the streets, or Arab could shoot from the roof...you never knew.</span> <span id="s1885">So, they were standing in the houses and the armored car would give the bread to the people.</span> <span id="s1886">Then they gave me a little Arab house, not house, I wouldn’t say house, like a shed with no windows.</span> <span id="s1887">You know that Arab houses don’t have windows, because they don’t...</span></p> <p><span id="s1888">Tape four, side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s1889">JF: This is tape #4 side #1 of an interview with Mrs. Chayale Ash-Fuhrman.</span></p> <p><span id="s1890">CA: My husband made in this shed a little hole so we can breathe.</span> <span id="s1891">And, at night, we couldn’t have light because Israel was still at war.</span> <span id="s1892">We couldn’t make light in the houses, we couldn’t walk at night, it was like curfew.</span> <span id="s1893">We couldn’t walk at night in the houses.</span> <span id="s1894">People in the streets had certain bands to show the people where the shelters are and this was the beginning of our life in Israel, ‘48, the beginning of ‘49.</span> <span id="s1895">Everything was on cards, on ration cards, even candles, to light a candle you have to...they have to be sure that you are religious to give you candles.</span> <span id="s1896">And I remember in that time I was very rebelling, and say, “I’m not religious but I want to light the candles.”</span> <span id="s1897">I’m used to that and since I had my baby I always lighted candles on Shabbos, but some of these religious people were very...all because they didn’t have enough and they give only what [unclear] and they rationed meat and everything was rationed.</span> <span id="s1898">We had some eggs and a little butter because of our child, because she was breast fed more than a year, because of her sickness, but she had a card to get three eggs a week and a little butter, so, we, the grown-ups used it.</span> <span id="s1899">So I can give better milk for the baby.</span> <span id="s1900">And this was in ‘49, the end of ‘49.</span> <span id="s1901">A group of actors came to me and said, “Chayale, it’s time to organize the theatre,” and I was the first one to organize a professional theatre in Haifa.</span> <span id="s1902">It’s called the Haifa Yiddishe Operetten Theatre.</span> <span id="s1903">It was done in Haifa.</span> <span id="s1904">They didn’t want us to rent us places to perform, they were afraid it’s in Jewish, it’s in Yiddish, and because it was a fight what language to be the dominating language of the country, because they spoke—the refugees—all kind of languages, and the Jews from Yemen was Arabic, Jews from Morocco and Algiers spoke Arabic, and Jews with European cultures spoke Yiddish, so it start a whole mish-mash in Israel.</span> <span id="s1905">And, in the time that they had to fight with the Arabs, they were thinking what language to introduce and what to do, and it was very hard for Yiddish actors to organize in the beginning.</span> <span id="s1906">We performed on roofs...the roofs in Israel are flat...where you are hanging the laundry...very flat.</span> <span id="s1907">They used to write the poster by hand, put them outside the gate of the house and at night the roof was packed with people.</span> <span id="s1908">They were hungry for Yiddish songs and for Yiddish theatre.</span> <span id="s1909">Or, you perform in a back yard, it was packed.</span> <span id="s1910">You perform on a roof, it was packed.</span> <span id="s1911">Everywhere you announced only, it was right away packed with people, the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1912">They were hungry.</span> <span id="s1913">People from the forests, from the partisan, people from the labor camps, people from everywhere, they came to listen, to hear, and the mostly...Jewish songs from before.</span> <span id="s1914">From the past.</span> <span id="s1915">This is, was...they used to cry, and laugh.</span> <span id="s1916">This was ‘49, ‘50, the beginning.</span> <span id="s1917">And that was...I was the first to organize the Yiddisher Operetten Theatre in Haifa.</span> <span id="s1918">And I was with this theatre the star of this group.</span> <span id="s1919">I wouldn’t call star...the main actress of this theatre for eight years, almost eight years.</span> <span id="s1920">Then, Israel established themselves beautifully.</span> <span id="s1921">They start bringing stars from all over, from America.</span> <span id="s1922">And they hired me to be as first actress in their ensemble, in their group, and I moved over to Tel Aviv, and in Tel Aviv I was till the last day of my coming here.</span> <span id="s1923">With intervals...</span></p> <p><span id="s1924">JF: Now, had there been Yiddish theatre also in Tel Aviv during the time that you were in Haifa?</span></p> <p><span id="s1925">CA: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1926">JF: Was there any other Yiddish theatre in Israel at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1927">CA: No, they hired us to Tel Aviv to come in the High Holidays, between the High Holidays, this is a very good time for Yiddish theatre.</span> <span id="s1928">[unclear] Yomtov is a very good night for theatre, when the holidays finishing.</span> <span id="s1929">The evening.</span> <span id="s1930">So, they hired the Haifa theatre to come to Tel Aviv to perform, not in auditorium, in a sport hall, Maccabee Hapoel was then.</span> <span id="s1931">So, in this hall we used to come and perform, and this was in the ’50’s in the beginning, in ‘51, and they took us to Tel Aviv.</span> <span id="s1932">And, little by little, because people from Tel Aviv organized and made another.</span> <span id="s1933">They named their theatre Goldfaden Theatre.</span> <span id="s1934">We called ourselves “Operetten Haifa Theatre.”</span> <span id="s1935">They called themselves “Yiddishe Goldfaden Theatre.”</span> <span id="s1936">Goldfaden was the founder of the Yiddish theatre.</span> <span id="s1937">So, little by little, it starts, and by year gone by, you had twelve months a year, three, four professional theatres in a country of three million people, known Jewish people, all three million.</span></p> <p><span id="s1938">JF: So, you performed in Tel Aviv in ‘51?</span></p> <p><span id="s1939">CA: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s1940">In end of ‘49 I start performing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1941">JF: In Tel Aviv?</span></p> <p><span id="s1942">CA: In Haifa.</span> <span id="s1943">Tel Aviv a lot later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1944">JF: In 1951, you said?</span></p> <p><span id="s1945">CA: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s1946">I performed in ‘49, ‘50 and ‘51.</span> <span id="s1947">In ‘51 they brought us to Tel Aviv for the first time to perform for their audiences, and it was a big success.</span></p> <p><span id="s1948">JF: That’s what I mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s1949">CA: So all the other groups start organizing because it was actors in Tel Aviv, too.</span> <span id="s1950">They start organizing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1951">JF: And then you, yourself, moved to Tel Aviv.</span></p> <p><span id="s1952">CA: I moved to Tel Aviv.</span></p> <p><span id="s1953">JF: In ‘57, about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1954">CA: Yes.</span> <span id="s1955">‘56 or ‘57, something like this, and start performing there.</span> <span id="s1956">Even in Tel Aviv, I was for a time a big, like a main actress.</span> <span id="s1957">In ‘58, I was called by London and I performed four months in the London Grand Palais Theatre.</span> <span id="s1958">They called me there “the leading lady of Tel Aviv,” not Israeli actress but “the leading lady of Tel Aviv.”</span> <span id="s1959">I still have posters somewhere.</span> <span id="s1960">I had it.</span> <span id="s1961">And then, in 1960, I was called to perform for four months in South Africa.</span> <span id="s1962">This was...we were called...But here in London, I was alone, a star.</span> <span id="s1963">Someone in London knew me as a child from Romania, as an actress, that my parents were actors, but in South Africa an all Israeli ensemble came, too...We played Johannesburg, Capetown, Pretoria, Port Elizabeth, Durban.</span> <span id="s1964">I was four months there.</span> <span id="s1965">From South Africa I came to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1966">JF: Why did you come to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1967">CA: This comes interesting.</span> <span id="s1968">I divorced my husband in 1953 and I was alone with my daughter and mother.</span> <span id="s1969">My son was with my husband and my daughter was with me.</span> <span id="s1970">She was a sick girl and I decided to keep her with me.</span> <span id="s1971">And I performed in Israel.</span> <span id="s1972">In 1959, Ari Fuhrman, my husband now, came from Bucharest, from the Romanian State Theatre, and performed together with me in Israel.</span> <span id="s1973">We met, knew each other very well.</span> <span id="s1974">I loved him right away, but we didn’t marry.</span> <span id="s1975">I know him, a good friend, I was with a sick mother and a child and he was with a little boy from his first marriage.</span> <span id="s1976">His parents were here in America from the D.P. camps.</span> <span id="s1977">They came here.</span> <span id="s1978">He didn’t see them for 15 years.</span> <span id="s1979">So, he decided to go to the States to see the parents.</span> <span id="s1980">He came to the United States and I went to Africa, and we were corresponding and he brought them...I don’t know, to go back to Israel or not to go back to Israel, or to stay in the United States, and I wrote him, “I’ll come to the United States,” not knowing that I will marry him.</span> <span id="s1981">I would like to see you.</span> <span id="s1982">I have a paid ticket, I can use it via New York.</span> <span id="s1983">So, I went.</span> <span id="s1984">I came to America, I met Ari, he introduced me to his family, to everybody and I had in mind, I had a ticket paid to go back to Israel and Ari asked me if I would like to marry him, in a very funny way, like only actors maybe will do.</span> <span id="s1985">“What are you doing Sunday?”</span> <span id="s1986">I says, “Nothing.”</span> <span id="s1987">“So, can you make time so that we can go and to marry?”</span> <span id="s1988">We married.</span> <span id="s1989">I brought over later my daughter for the reason for the surgery, knowing that medicine is in America.</span> <span id="s1990">We would return to Israel, we had in mind.</span> <span id="s1991">But I brought my daughter here.</span> <span id="s1992">She went through surgery, she found a wonderful guy and married here, so we decided to stay here.</span> <span id="s1993">And my son was still there.</span> <span id="s1994">I used to go every year, twice a year, to Israel.</span> <span id="s1995">That was my life.</span> <span id="s1996">I said, “I am earning money with the theatre to go and see my children every time in Israel.”</span> <span id="s1997">And, really, one thing I know, that now, I feel very happy, with everything I went through, I feel very happy.</span> <span id="s1998">Happy for one reason, that we survived, in spite of everything that happened.</span> <span id="s1999">This is the first thing.</span> <span id="s2000">Second one, that we have children, despite that children were killed, we can continue with our families, we can continue with our lives, and I’m involved in everything that has to do with Yiddish culture, with Yiddish life, and I will never let my kids forget what I went through because my children’s essays in high school was the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s2001">My son and my daughter, the same thing.</span> <span id="s2002">They wrote about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s2003">They made interview with people with numbers and I gave them the material and they wrote about the Holocaust in essays in high school.</span> <span id="s2004">Because this is the only way to make our future generations not to forget.</span> <span id="s2005">It’s hard, sometimes to talk about things to children, sometimes you don’t even want them to know even about that.</span> <span id="s2006">But this is the biggest mistake a lot of parents made, to hide the real truth.</span> <span id="s2007">They had to find it out later on, when they are college students or whatever it is, what went on.</span> <span id="s2008">It would better be to find out first hand from their own parents, but usually, “Don’t bother me, I don’t want to know.</span> <span id="s2009">Do I have to eat because other people are starving?”</span> <span id="s2010">The same way, “Do I have to cry now because there was a Holocaust?”</span> <span id="s2011">It was hard, but thank God, now it was the gathering in Israel.</span> <span id="s2012">A lot of young people went there.</span> <span id="s2013">They gave over to the young people the legacy not to forget..., they don’t have to go through to know about it.</span> <span id="s2014">So, this is a very healthy way to do it.</span> <span id="s2015">With our children...I don’t know about our grandchildren, maybe because it’s so far away...
