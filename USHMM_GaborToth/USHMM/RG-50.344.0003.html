Feldhusen.</span> <span id="s16">Tell me please, when -- when were you born and where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: Well, I was born in Brooklyn, New York, April 21st, 1918.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: And where were you living when you decided to become a nurse?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: Oh, I was still living in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, on MacDonough Street, between Louis Avenue and Stuyvesant, which was a very nice area at that time.</span> <span id="s20">And my family lived there about 10 years and then we moved to Park Slope in Brooklyn.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: And why did you decide you wanted to be a nurse?</span> <span id="s22">How did you decide that?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: Well, things happen in my life in peculiar ways.</span> <span id="s24">I had been a Girl Scout and when I was 12 -- I still remember that, we were given a course on home -- I think the Red Cross gave it -- home nursing and care of the sick.</span> <span id="s25">And I just looked at that book and read it once and the whole thing was memorized.</span> <span id="s26">But my mother was always against it, so when I graduated from high school, I looked for a job, it was in the middle of the Depression and --</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: In 1936, in June of ‘36 and I looked for a job and I finally found something in a hair net factory and I worked one week and I wouldn’t go back.</span> <span id="s28">My mother went back for my seven dollars check or cash -- they paid in cash in those days.</span> <span id="s29">And then the same agency that had gotten me that job, said she would -- I was a Roman Catholic and they kept asking me if I would change my religion, believe it or not.</span> <span id="s30">So by then -- that was around, I think September, or so.</span> <span id="s31">So I finally said, “All right, I’ll change it.”</span> <span id="s32">So she said, “Just fill out the card and put Protestant down.”</span> <span id="s33">You know, make out the card the same way.</span> <span id="s34">And she sent me over to a place with a -- oh, there must have been about 10 or 12 of us and they gave us little tests.</span> <span id="s35">And the one test I remember was a row of numbers and they said, just put a circle around, say the seventh.</span> <span id="s36">Just go down the whole column and -- and then we had some other things that were similar and then they disappeared and then they came out again and they said, “Well, Miss So and So and Miss So and So and Miss Feldhusen will please remain and the others may go.”</span> <span id="s37">So I was hired.</span> <span id="s38">And I worked there until -- I think it was from November, maybe October, until the first of February.</span> <span id="s39">And then I went into nurses training.</span> <span id="s40">But the way the nurses training came about was that my father tuned pianos --</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: Before you tell me this, I want to -- hang on one second.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: One of his jobs was at Brooklyn State Hospital.</span> <span id="s43">In those days they had big state hospitals.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: So, my father talked to the -- well, when he went to Brooklyn State, he always went in to see the superintendent and -- and then they would let him know where he was to go.</span> <span id="s46">So he knew the superintendent quite well, so he told him about his daughter, who was having trouble finding a job.</span> <span id="s47">But eventually, you know, I was working.</span> <span id="s48">Just doing file clerk work.</span> <span id="s49">And so the superintendent says, “Well, we have a nurses training school here.</span> <span id="s50">Why don’t you have your daughter come and enter our class?”</span> <span id="s51">And that was around October, November.</span> <span id="s52">So my father came home and told me that and I said, “Well, I’m sure the classes started in September and I would be two months later and I’d never be able to catch up.”</span> <span id="s53">So he -- so my father says, “Well, I pass by King’s County Hospital when I go to Brooklyn State,” cause he went on the subway.</span> <span id="s54">And so I wrote to -- to King’s County and applied and they sent me all the applications and whatnot.</span> <span id="s55">Now, they took classes twice a year and their next class was the first of February.</span> <span id="s56">So I was accepted and -- and then where I was working -- I worked right up until the last day and left and went into nurses training.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: And just by happenstance, I really picked one of the best schools in New York.</span> <span id="s59">In it’s day, it was very, very fine.</span> <span id="s60">And I had a friend that went to Bellevue and there was just no comparison.</span> <span id="s61">We were treated like young ladies and we were expected to be young ladies.</span> <span id="s62">And at Bellevue it was helter-skelter, come as you go and just -- really, you had to be tough to go there.</span> <span id="s63">So I -- it worked out very well for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: And when did you finish your training?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: Well, that was a three year training course.</span> <span id="s66">I mean, they practically don’t have those any more.</span> <span id="s67">But when I graduated -- I had always wanted to go into public health.</span> <span id="s68">We had two months of public health experience as part of our nurses training and I liked it.</span> <span id="s69">And so I went to the Brooklyn Visiting Nurse Association and applied for a position.</span> <span id="s70">And she said, “You have to have one term of college.”</span> <span id="s71">So then I went to New York University and wen -- went to night school.</span> <span id="s72">And I finally got my 16 college points and -- and I worked for them almost a year.</span> <span id="s73">But then people were going into the army and I had patients -- my sickest patients would say to me, “What are you taking care of me for?</span> <span id="s74">You should be taking care of the boys.”</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: I had that time and time again.</span> <span id="s77">So I have a very close friend, and she also wanted to go, so we went in together, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: When was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: That was very vivid in my mind, the first of July, 1943.</span> <span id="s80">I still remember that first day.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: Oh, it was a day like this, hot as anything and her brother took us to the -- to get the train to go down to Wilmington, Delaware.</span> <span id="s82">And we were given very little instruction as to what to do.</span> <span id="s83">We got down to Delaware -- down to Wilmington and I think some -- it’s -- there were very brief letter and it said, “You go to Wilmington and you take the army bus to fort -- to Fort Dupont Delaware.”</span> <span id="s84">And we couldn’t find the bus.</span> <span id="s85">And there was no air conditioning in those days and we were rushing around from here to there and we were there almost all day.</span> <span id="s86">And we were so hot.</span> <span id="s87">I was exhausted.</span> <span id="s88">And we went to the travelers agency that is supposed to help travelers.</span> <span id="s89">They didn’t know a thing about Fort Dupont.</span> <span id="s90">And they were there really to help people in the service.</span> <span id="s91">Didn’t know anything about their bus service.</span> <span id="s92">Well finally, as I recall, somebody overheard us.</span> <span id="s93">Must have been a soldier and he said, oh yes, there was a bus around six o’clock at night, something like that and he told us where to go.</span> <span id="s94">So we ended up at Fort Dupont, we didn’t have any supper and we were just exhausted.</span> <span id="s95">And -- and the chief nurse just act as if we were arriving at eight o’clock in the morning and I thought she was going to put us on duty right away.</span> <span id="s96">But she finally let us go and showed us our rooms and -- and that led -- that was my first day of army experience and it was really, really -- it wasn’t very pleasant.</span> <span id="s97">Now I was just looking at Phyllis’s photographs.</span> <span id="s98">Now she was in big hospitals like Tilton General and England General and -- and I was very small.</span> <span id="s99">We only had seven nurses and four doctors.</span> <span id="s100">Very small place.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: There at Fort Dupont?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: At Fort Dupont, Delaware.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: How long were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: Where did you join them?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: Well, I tried to think.</span> <span id="s108">I’m not really -- we went -- I really don’t remember, really, how we formed, or whether we had to report.</span> <span id="s109">Someplace down in South Carolina, that’s where we left from.</span> <span id="s110">But it’s really very vague in my mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: Were you on the ship then -- on the Queen Elizabeth, crossing with [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s113">We were all together, yes.</span> <span id="s114">And I re -- we were -- there were 40 of us and half were in one state room and half in another state room.</span> <span id="s115">And we had bunks up to the ceiling.</span> <span id="s116">And I had a bottom bunk and I really had to lie on the floor in order to get into that bunk.</span> <span id="s117">And then all night long, the ship would go this way and that way, so you’re either on your feet or on your head.</span> <span id="s118">But the reason was -- I don’t know if the other girls told you, but that we turned every seven minutes in order to avoid the submarines, because we did not have any escort across the ocean.</span> <span id="s119">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: Were you -- were you nervous?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: I don’t remember that I was.</span> <span id="s122">You know, when you’re young and it was like a -- an adventure, you know, and all these activities and whatnot you had never been exposed to before.</span> <span id="s123">But we were very crowded, that I remember.</span> <span id="s124">It was very hard to find a place to sit down anywheres, you know, they -- we had about 10,000 troops on that ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: Wow.</span> <span id="s126">And 40 nurses.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: Yeah, well, the nurses, we didn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s128">You know, we were just in a group, we weren’t performing any nursing --</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: Excuse me, any nursing functions.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: Were you the only women on the ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: Yeah, as I remember we were the only women.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: 40 women out of 10,000.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: Well, I’ll tell you, men were more respectful in those days.</span> <span id="s135">In fact, I remember when I was at Fort Dupont and two of the men -- two of the corpsmen were out in the hall and one of them used a -- a foul word --</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: Watch your microphone, now.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: -- and he immediately came in and apologized.</span> <span id="s138">You see, and that wouldn’t exist today, because the girls themselves use f -- terrible language.</span> <span id="s139">I hear it when I go to Brooklyn, right in the street, so I think women have really damaged themselves by trying to become -- meet the level of everybody else.</span> <span id="s140">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: Well, tell me what it was like in England.</span> <span id="s142">What did you do in England?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: Well, of course we landed in Greenock, Scotland and we had to climb over the side and get down into a trawler, because the Queen could only go in so far.</span> <span id="s144">And then -- and we tramped, we had these heavy boots on and fatigues and we tramped to a train station and I can still remember that, the noise, you know, as we walked in the street.</span> <span id="s145">And everybody of course, I think everybody was probably nervous because we didn’t know what was going to happen.</span> <span id="s146">And we came to a train station and we got on the train -- and this is about two or three o’clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s147">And we rode for awhile and then we got off and then we tramped some more and then they said, “The girls will have this building and then the men will be here and the other men will be there.”</span> <span id="s148">And as we went down the street, everybody got a place to live and you went in and -- and there was a pile of blankets in the front hall and you grabbed a blanket and you just laid on it and mine was so greasy.</span> <span id="s149">I was awake all night, I couldn’t sleep.</span> <span id="s150">And that was the beginning of our adventure there.</span> <span id="s151">And -- see, we were supposed to go right into France and then changes were made.</span> <span id="s152">Something happened to the American troops and so everything was changed.</span> <span id="s153">So then we didn’t do much of anything and finally we were assigned to local units.</span> <span id="s154">And I know I went to Wales and worked there.</span> <span id="s155">But I really don’t know how long I was there.</span> <span id="s156">Couple of weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: You were care -- you were there caring for [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: Yeah, we -- they were running ha -- actually American-run hospitals.</span> <span id="s159">And the one in Wales, the nurses lived in -- in these Neesan huts.</span> <span id="s160">And when you wanted to take a bath, you had to run out and well, quite a distance to go to the bathroom or to take your bath.</span> <span id="s161">And -- so you didn’t take a bath too often, but I know the nights when I got off duty, I had everything all ready and I just grabbed everything and then ran up to that place, because if you didn’t get there first, somebody else did and you didn’t get any more hot water.</span> <span id="s162">So, I mean, even if you took a bath twice a week, at least you -- you got a good one when you -- if you got there first.</span> <span id="s163">So, I was there probably a couple weeks and I was o -- on a psychiatric ward, which, I never cared for that service, but anyhow -- and then eventually we were all recalled and then we went over into Europe proper.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: All of you 40 together?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: Yes, all of us, yes.</span> <span id="s166">Except one nurse.</span> <span id="s167">She was married and before we went overseas, we had time off and she met her husband in Florida.</span> <span id="s168">We were all wondering what’s happened to her.</span> <span id="s169">You know, we lost sight of her.</span> <span id="s170">And she got pregnant in that short period.</span> <span id="s171">So by the time we got to England, she knew she was pregnant and they sent her right home.</span> <span id="s172">So we had 39.</span> <span id="s173">And we never -- and they told us, if anything happened, we would never -- nobody would be replaced.</span> <span id="s174">So we functioned just with the 39 then.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: So you crossed the English channel and --</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: -- went to a --</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: Yeah, we did that in the middle of the night also.</span> <span id="s179">And they dropped these big gasoline -- I don’t know what they call them, they’re about as big as gasoline cans.</span> <span id="s180">And that went on all night --</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: Depth charges.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: -- you just heard boom, boom, boom, because of the submarines.</span> <span id="s183">So, and then we landed in France.</span> <span id="s184">Gee, I’ve forgotten the name of the place.</span> <span id="s185">Le Havre --</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: Le Havre.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: Le Havre is where we -- and I’d never -- course I’d never been to Europe before and I wanted to see everything I could.</span> <span id="s188">And then they loaded us -- loaded us into trucks.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: Do you remember what month this would have been?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: Um, we were not allowed to keep diaries and I had everything with me and we were told we must get rid of everything.</span> <span id="s191">And that’s my -- and a lot of people -- not my -- I don’t know about my unit, but other people did keep diaries.</span> <span id="s192">I mean men.</span> <span id="s193">And -- so the dates are very vague to me.</span> <span id="s194">And I don’t know if --</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: Was it warm, was it summer?</span> <span id="s196">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: Oh no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: Was it -- would have been the --</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: I remember now.</span> <span id="s200">Now I’m beginning to remember.</span> <span id="s201">When we were still in England, we landed two days before Christmas.</span> <span id="s202">Now it’s coming back to me.</span> <span id="s203">And when we were still back in the States, somebody, one of the girls said, “We’re going to land near Christmas, let’s get gifts for the men.”</span> <span id="s204">And I don’t know who that was, or a couple of them bought all little gifts and wrapped them all up.</span> <span id="s205">And we knew how many people there were and one of the men dressed up in Santa Claus -- this is after we were in England and -- and Bowden -- what’s the name?</span> <span id="s206">Three names -- anyhow -- and -- and Santa Claus went around and gave out the gifts and the men were really shook up because a lot of them are family people.</span> <span id="s207">And anyhow, that was our first Christmas.</span> <span id="s208">Just about two days before Christmas was when we landed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: That was Christmas of 1944?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: So the Battle of the Bulge was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: In -- on the continent.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: Which may be why we didn’t go into France directly, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s217">And -- but we really -- I mean all these things you hear about, all the -- the Stars and Stripes, that newspaper.</span> <span id="s218">I never saw that paper.</span> <span id="s219">We never had any of this entertainment, you know, of the troops being entertained and -- we never had any of that.</span> <span id="s220">We were always very isolated.</span> <span id="s221">When we went into Europe proper, then we were living in tents and there were about six of us in each squad tent.</span> <span id="s222">So we did go over -- I would say February, March, somewheres around then.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: Somebody else told me March.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: Yeah, it could have been March, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: And you were transported then, through France?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: Well, we always drove in two and a half ton trucks and our unit was always together.</span> <span id="s227">And we had a colonel that was very considerate of the nurses.</span> <span id="s228">And he always had a party go ahead to wherever we were going to be and he had the trenches dug, you know, cause we -- and the tents put up so when the nurses arrived, they went right into their tents and we had our latrines and everything set up.</span> <span id="s229">He always had that done first, he was a very considerate man.</span> <span id="s230">Which is sort of unusual, you know, especially when they’re doctors.</span> <span id="s231">But -- and then he loved to travel and eventually, when we were working at Gusen, Camp Gusen and we were near some of these -- now one of the girls mentioned this place and I’ve been there twice.</span> <span id="s232">And he knew about it cause he traveled a lot in Europe and wanted us to see that and I had two chances to go, because not everybody wanted to go, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: Let’s -- let’s go back a little bit before you got to Gusen.</span> <span id="s234">Was that -- that wasn’t the first place where you set up, you were set up in tents?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: Oh yeah, we were set up in quite a number of places, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: In the spring of ‘45.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: Mm-hm, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: March, April, May --</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: Before the war.</span> <span id="s241">There was still fighting going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: Oh yes, April -- I mean, when we were in Germany, when the war was over -- no, before that, we were going to be overrun by the Germans.</span> <span id="s243">We all got a Battle Star for that and we were given instructions.</span> <span id="s244">That I remember vividly and the -- we were told, “Just continue working as if nothing was happening.</span> <span id="s245">Do -- take care of your patients, do the same thing.</span> <span id="s246">And you may be questioned, but just answer the questions, but don’t let it bother you,” and course we weren’t.</span> <span id="s247">But we were very close and you could hear these great, big tanks coming.</span> <span id="s248">In fact, one day on my ward, one tank was so close and you could hear it coming, that even the bed patients got out of bed to see it.</span> <span id="s249">You know, you could hear this noise coming and I guess they were alarmed, because you didn’t know who it was, but they were Americans.</span> <span id="s250">And -- so we were very close, just at that one period.</span> <span id="s251">And that was someplace in Germany.</span> <span id="s252">And I couldn’t tell you where.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: And -- and then eventually we went into Austria.</span> <span id="s255">And that was when our unit left us for about a week or two weeks and the colonel said, “We’ll be back.”</span> <span id="s256">And one of the girls -- she was going with one of the men, that she eventually married.</span> <span id="s257">And she started crying.</span> <span id="s258">I can remember Jeannie Albers, so upset.</span> <span id="s259">She says, “We’re never going to see them again.”</span> <span id="s260">Anyhow, they did come back when they said they would.</span> <span id="s261">And they got us.</span> <span id="s262">And then the colonel, in the morning said, you know, where he had us all standing -- this makes me very emotional.</span> <span id="s263">I can’t help it.</span> <span id="s264">Every time I tell this.</span> <span id="s265">He said, “You don’t have to go.”</span> <span id="s266">He said, “There’s a lot of tuberculosis and a lot of chronic illnesses and,” he said, “you don’t have to go if you don’t want to.”</span> <span id="s267">Well, everybody went except about three or four people.</span> <span id="s268">And when we came back the next day, everybody went.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: Where was -- where were you when he told you this?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: That was at Gusen.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: When you arrived there?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s273">We were living in Linz.</span> <span id="s274">Well, it’s -- we had to go on duty the next day, as soon as they came and got us.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: Wait, let -- let me make sure this is clear.</span> <span id="s276">You went to Austria from Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: And this would have been the end of April, early May?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: Maybe -- could be.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: Now --</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: I’ve always been wanting to get my unit’s -- you know, they ha -- the -- each unit had to write up their experience and I’ve always been wanting to get a copy of that, because I don’t know about the dates.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: Well, when did he tell you this?</span> <span id="s285">Before you got to Linz?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: Oh no, when we arrived at Linz.</span> <span id="s287">He then said he wanted the nurses lined up.</span> <span id="s288">You know, you lined up for everything and -- and we stood and -- and that was when he told us that -- that we did not have to go if we didn’t want to.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: Did he tell you what you would see?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s291">All I remember is that he said, “There’s a great deal of tuberculosis here,” which is quite infectious, and -- and whatever else he told us, that’s about all I remember of it.</span> <span id="s292">And maybe he told us we’d see a lot of things that -- that we -- you know, that would be very hard to accept, but I’m very vague on that.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: Had you heard anything about concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: No, no I never had, no.</span> <span id="s295">And now see, some of the girls knew a lot of the officers, you know, and they may have learned things that way, but I never knew.</span> <span id="s296">I never had anything to do with them, I never bothered.</span> <span id="s297">And, well, like that one girl, they were keeping company, so I’m sure he must have talked to her about things.</span> <span id="s298">Now, what he heard, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s299">And so, that’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: Well, the next day then?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: Yeah, the next day, we went on duty right away, the next morning.</span> <span id="s302">And that was when he told us that.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: And that was at Gusen?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: Yes, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: And what was your responsibility?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: Well, I had a ward, big ward and there was a great deal of diarrhea and we were giving out sulfanilamide, which is -- I don’t think it’s a drug used any more, but it’s before the antibiotics came in.</span> <span id="s307">And, oh we gave out like 20 pills and everybody was up in tiers.</span> <span id="s308">In order to get up to the top person, you had to stand on the lower tiers to reach them.</span> <span id="s309">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: Was this a barracks that they were in?</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A: It was like a barracks, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: It wasn’t a hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: Well, we ca -- I think our hospital called it the hospital, because all these were the sickest people.</span> <span id="s314">And they were in -- lying in these tiers, these one, two, well at least three -- three up.</span> <span id="s315">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: Were those the barracks that they had been living in previously?</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: That I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s318">That I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: But you would -- that became your ward then?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: That was --</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: You cared for them every day?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: -- yes, mm-hm, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s323">And eventually we got these young German prisoners of war to help us as ward men.</span> <span id="s324">You know, to carry bedpans and urinals and -- and help, and we had very little to eat.</span> <span id="s325">We didn’t have much food and they -- our group went around thinking they could get food from the German warehouses and they found they were empty.</span> <span id="s326">Everything had been used up, you know, because it was the end, and everybody was -- I guess the Germans were fleeing and -- and had used up what they could.</span> <span id="s327">And that was really -- I guess they ran out of -- must have ran out of supplies and whatnot.</span> <span id="s328">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s330">They were all men where I was, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: And the first day you saw them, what -- what was their condition?</span> <span id="s332">What -- what were they --</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: Well, they were lying in bed and they were weak and very thin.</span> <span id="s334">And I guess it was shocking, you know, when you’re not used to seeing all those types of things and people.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: Were they clothed?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: Yeah, they had shirts on of some kind, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s337">And -- and pajamas, seems to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: The striped?</span> <span id="s339">Did they have on the striped --</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: No, I don’t remember that, it just seems to me they had -- they had plain pajamas on.</span> <span id="s341">I don’t really remember exactly what they had on, but they -- they were covered.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: Were they able to speak to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: Well, they didn’t speak English, but I can get by with a little German and so that was -- but I mean there really wasn’t too much to say either, you know, when you’re coming with the pills and they’re objecting and you’re saying, Si moosta dus taking, you know?</span> <span id="s344">Me with my German and English.</span> <span id="s345">So they -- they got the picture and -- and then they’d swallow them and so --</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: Were you bathing them or --</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: No, we didn’t do anything like that, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: Did other people do that for them?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: No.</span> <span id="s350">I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s351">Really, it just took you all day giving out the medication.</span> <span id="s352">So -- and whether --</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: Why did that take so long?</span> <span id="s354">Why did it take --</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: Well, because we had so many people.</span> <span id="s356">Oh, I had a big ward.</span> <span id="s357">I don’t know, I had rooms and rooms with all these people on t -- in tiers, you know, three or four tiers going up.</span> <span id="s358">In one room you had, boy, three, four, eight, 12 -- sic -- I bet you had about at least 20 people in one room.</span> <span id="s359">You know, all these like three and three.</span> <span id="s360">It’s sort of vague to me, though.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: And they -- did you feed them, were they -- did you have food for them?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: Well, we had food.</span> <span id="s363">And that’s another thing.</span> <span id="s364">I don’t quite recall how we did that.</span> <span id="s365">We would have to have had trays, unless we had -- maybe there were tin dishes and we gave them the dishes, you know.</span> <span id="s366">That, again, is vague to me.</span> <span id="s367">I -- just how we did that.</span> <span id="s368">I don’t remember any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: What kinds of precautions were you able to take to protect yourself from --</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: We really didn’t take any.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: Nothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: No, we had fatigues on and that was all.</span> <span id="s373">We didn’t wear gowns or anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: Other people have mentioned DDT spray.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: Oh, that’s another thing, yes.</span> <span id="s376">Before we went on duty, we had a gun that was about that long and they’d fill it with DDT and then it had a plunger and you held your thing out -- your suit open like this and somebody would plunge it and plunge it down the back.</span> <span id="s377">And then your hair was all done -- we wore helmets.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: It was powder, DDT powder?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: It was powder, yes.</span> <span id="s380">And -- and I don’t know, I had cancer of the breast and nobody ever asked me if I was exposed to DDT.</span> <span id="s381">And I often wonder if it had anything to do with that.</span> <span id="s382">But then, there are an awful lot of women that have had the same thing that I have.</span> <span id="s383">So -- but we certainly was full of DTT.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: Every day?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: Every day we did it.</span> <span id="s386">Tons of it.</span> <span id="s387">Nobody realized how dangerous it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: You were probably grateful to have it?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s390">Yeah, because they said there might be lice, you know and whatnot and so -- but I never caught anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: Did anybody?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s393">I was very sick when I was in England, but that’s before I ever had any contact with them.</span> <span id="s394">So, I think we were all quite healthy.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: In the evenings, when you weren’t on duty, what -- what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: Well, all we had were these tents to sit in.</span> <span id="s397">We went on walks.</span> <span id="s398">Oh, that was in England, when I went on that walk.</span> <span id="s399">I don’t -- oh, I know, when we were in Germany, in one area, a whole group of us, including the men, decided to go on a walk and we did walk up on a hill.</span> <span id="s400">And there was a -- you could hear the cuckoo.</span> <span id="s401">You know, in Germany, the cuckoos sound like the cuckoo clock.</span> <span id="s402">Cuckoo, cuckoo.</span> <span id="s403">And I -- I was a birdwatcher and I says, “Oh, I’m dying to see that cuckoo.”</span> <span id="s404">So the whole group of us went up and climbed up that hill and we were walking around and looking and we could hear it -- cuckoo -- coming from different -- and all of a sudden, bullets started firing.</span> <span id="s405">See, it was a come on.</span> <span id="s406">And we got down from there very, very fast.</span> <span id="s407">And there was no mistaking who we were, because we had big Red Crosses on all our tents.</span> <span id="s408">Our tents were all down at the base.</span> <span id="s409">But you could hear the wi -- the bullets flying right overhead.</span> <span id="s410">You could hear them whistling.</span> <span id="s411">Never saw anybody.</span> <span id="s412">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: When you were at -- working every day at Gusen in Austria.</span> <span id="s414">D-Do you remember ever going out into the town there, seeing the local people at all?</span> <span id="s415">Did you [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: Well we lived -- we lived about 10 miles away and they transported us back and forth by truck.</span> <span id="s417">And we did -- in the building I was -- we were in two houses and -- the nurses were and -- cause we were all bunched up together in the rooms and we had a -- a girl -- a German girl that took care of -- kept everything clean and whatnot.</span> <span id="s418">And -- but we really didn’t converse very much with her, because most of the girls didn’t know any German and she didn’t know any English.</span> <span id="s419">But there was one girl in my group that wanted a tablecloth that she had fixed up nicely -- to decor -- you know, make everything look nicer.</span> <span id="s420">And she wanted that tablecloth and she said, you know, “Ask her,” you know, “if I can have the tablecloth of if she’ll sell it to me or what.”</span> <span id="s421">So I asked her.</span> <span id="s422">And she said, “No.”</span> <span id="s423">She says, “My husband gave me that and I don’t know where he is.”</span> <span id="s424">So -- I mean the sorrow was on their side also.</span> <span id="s425">So war is just awful.</span> <span id="s426">That’s why this Bosnia really bothers me -- what they’re doing there to people.</span> <span id="s427">Just awful.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s429">When -- how long did you stay there, working at Gusen?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: Well, we came home -- the war in Japan -- well, while we were still -- no, that was in Germany, when the war was over and Hitler killed himself and my friend Grace brought this radio with her.</span> <span id="s431">I think she was ready to throw it away many a time.</span> <span id="s432">And -- you could never really get anything on it, cause we had so little ele-electricity, but she had it connected that night and we could hear the funeral music.</span> <span id="s433">And we said something has happened.</span> <span id="s434">But we found out later, you know, that Hitler had killed himself.</span> <span id="s435">And that was all -- you know, everything was garbled, you couldn’t get anything.</span> <span id="s436">We hardly had a light to see by.</span> <span id="s437">You know, one light and just enough electricity so you could find your way around, cause we had our own generators and they were very limited.</span> <span id="s438">But when we were in Gusen -- did somebody tell you about that terrible accident when we were crossing the river?</span> <span id="s439">We were talking about it earlier.</span> <span id="s440">We were -- every once in awhile you know, like the infantry or the armored group would find out that there were nurses in the area and then we would be invited over for a social evening.</span> <span id="s441">And we’d all went in a big group and we all came back together.</span> <span id="s442">And we were going to cross the river, the Danube and that’s a very fast flowing river.</span> <span id="s443">And -- and there were signs there.</span> <span id="s444">I’d been across it a couple of times and signs that said to the Jeeps, “Do not start up your engines until the boat has docked.”</span> <span id="s445">And it was just a flat board, you know, boards.</span> <span id="s446">And we went over on a wire.</span> <span id="s447">And the wire hel -- was connected to the boat and that would guide it over, and then it would come back again.</span> <span id="s448">Otherwise the boat wa -- it wasn’t really a boat, it was a raft -- would be swept down the river.</span> <span id="s449">So we arrived this evening, we were -- quite a group of us, and -- for a social evening, some group across the river.</span> <span id="s450">And the soldier that was there on duty was in a terrible state.</span> <span id="s451">And he said, “The most awful thing has happened,” he said, “so there’ll be a little delay.”</span> <span id="s452">He said one of the Jeeps started up their engine and a nun had come along with her horse and carriage and the horse bolted.</span> <span id="s453">It frightened him so, that he just ran and of course there was nothing to stop him.</span> <span id="s454">Ended up in the river and she and the horse drowned.</span> <span id="s455">Now we were talking about that earlier today and they said they thought that the nun had some children in the -- orphans or something.</span> <span id="s456">I says, “I don’t ever remember hearing that.”</span> <span id="s457">But I know then -- and they finally found her and the horse.</span> <span id="s458">The horse, they let him just go, he was already gone.</span> <span id="s459">But she was drowned.</span> <span id="s460">The water is so -- was so swift there.</span> <span id="s461">So little things like that happened, you know and tragedy.</span> <span id="s462">Didn’t have to.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: So.</span> <span id="s465">But it was the way they -- because all the bridges had been blown up, you see.</span> <span id="s466">In fact, when we crossed the bridge, one of the -- the Rhine, we came down a hill and we were in the truck, ca -- and we went across on pontoon -- a pontoon bridge.</span> <span id="s467">And I remember we were coming down the hill and one of the girls stood up and she started screaming.</span> <span id="s468">She thought we were going to go right into the water.</span> <span id="s469">But -- and the pontoon bridge, you know, the pontoons with something in between were just wide enough and the truck went across very carefully.</span> <span id="s470">So, that was an experience, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: Do you ever remember having any sense of whether or not the local people knew that there was a concentration camp there?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: No, I really --</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: [indecipherable] have any --</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: I really never mingled -- we really didn’t have that occasion and the only person was this maid that we had in our building and I don’t remember her name any more.</span> <span id="s475">She was -- really is -- I remember a very nice person.</span> <span id="s476">And some of the girls said they asked her -- I never did -- and they said she didn’t know anything about it.</span> <span id="s477">But I mean, when things have come up like that, I said, “If terrible things go on in our prison, do we really know about it?”</span> <span id="s478">I said, “Like the people living in Sing-Sing -- unless they know the guards who come home at night, how really are you going to find out about things?”</span> <span id="s479">So I -- I don’t really know that you can really blame somebody and said they must have known.</span> <span id="s480">But I mean, how do you really know unless you knew somebody that had something to do with it?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: Well, in some cases, if there was a crematorium, there would be smoke and -- you know, thousands of people coming in and nobody coming out and --</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s483">But see, the town we lived in, they said was about 10 miles away.</span> <span id="s484">They told us, you know, we’d be -- apparently that was the only housing they could find and we had to -- we were driven those 10 miles going in the morning and 10 miles coming back in the evening.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: You didn’t have any --</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: -- sense of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: No.</span> <span id="s491">And there weren’t people living around us.</span> <span id="s492">I think they -- the German officers had lived in these houses and left in a hurry.</span> <span id="s493">Did you get that story from anybody?</span> <span id="s494">And they left two dachshunds and we adopted one dachshund and we took him all the ways back to France when we were going home and then we had to stay in the -- these Lucky Strike -- did you hear about those?</span> <span id="s495">The different --</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: Camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: Camps.</span> <span id="s498">And we stayed in Lucky Strike.</span> <span id="s499">And they wouldn’t let us take our dog in.</span> <span id="s500">And the fella said, “No animals allowed, but when you go home you can have him back.”</span> <span id="s501">And we never saw him again.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: Shloffin.</span> <span id="s504">It means he was sleepy.</span> <span id="s505">He was probably an older dog and he was such a nice dog.</span> <span id="s506">We have photographs of him.</span> <span id="s507">And when we were going back, we went back on the train and then we’d take turns, you know, when the dog had to wee-wee, to jump off the train.</span> <span id="s508">Well, the train would stop in the middle of woods -- wooded areas.</span> <span id="s509">We don’t know why it stopped, but it would stop.</span> <span id="s510">And sometimes we’d be there a half hour and sometimes 10 minutes.</span> <span id="s511">Well, I know when I jumped off with the dog, and he’s going from one tree to another as dogs do, all of a sudden the train started up.</span> <span id="s512">He didn’t stay very -- he must have been there five minutes and I’m running and I lifted up the dog and I can still remember all the hands and they took the dog and then s -- they grabbed me, because it was going faster and faster.</span> <span id="s513">So, I would still be there, I guess, if they hadn’t gotten me back on.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: Well, do your re -- do you know how long were you in Gusen?</span> <span id="s515">How -- when -- when did you leave there?</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: No, I couldn’t tell you exactly how long, but I was home for August when the -- when the war was over, the Japanese war.</span> <span id="s517">I had just gotten home before that -- well our unit did.</span> <span id="s518">And we -- they gave us a month vacation and I was home during that period.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: On leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: On leave.</span> <span id="s521">And then we reassembled and that was August.</span> <span id="s522">So, I must have been there then, til the beginning of August, or maybe the end of July, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: And do you think you were at Gusen three, four weeks, something like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: Oh, at least.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: Oh, I think so, longer than that.</span> <span id="s527">And then the different nationalities were coming.</span> <span id="s528">And I can remember the French came to take all those prisoners that had been French or -- victims.</span> <span id="s529">And -- and the French were so ungrateful.</span> <span id="s530">They were -- because they -- we hadn’t fed them and we hadn’t this and we hadn’t that.</span> <span id="s531">And -- and there wasn’t anything to do anything with.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: Who -- which -- which -- who was ungrateful?</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: They were the fr -- like the French Nationals.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: Who were in the concentration camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: Oh, well people -- we had all nationalities there and the different representatives from those countries came and -- and then they’d go off with the whole group of say French speaking or Dutch people or -- there were other nationalities there, but I remember the French most vividly.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: And -- and who was not grateful?</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: The French that came --</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: That came.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: -- for their Nationals.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: They thought that you should care for them?</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: We should have done much better than we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: For them?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s544">For their Nationals.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: That were in the concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: Did you treat everybody the same?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: Everybody was treated the same.</span> <span id="s549">In fact, you didn’t know who was who, one from the other.</span> <span id="s550">But -- but that was -- you know, when everything was winding down and these people were going home, back to their own countries.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: In retrospect was it -- it was -- are you saying it was the best care you could give, but was it --</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: It wasn’t really the best, but it was the best in the circumstances.</span> <span id="s553">I don’t think anything more could have been done.</span> <span id="s554">And -- I mean, you could think of, when you run a hospital, what about the laundry service and what about this service and that service?</span> <span id="s555">And I guess it was all minimal.</span> <span id="s556">Probably there wasn’t any laundry service.</span> <span id="s557">But I can remember that they had sheets or like -- because as -- I think they had straw as mattresses and it seems to me that it was like in a -- you know a bag, like a sleeping bag.</span> <span id="s558">You know, it would all be stuffed in there, otherwise it would be flying all over.</span> <span id="s559">And it seems to me that’s what they had and I don’t remember that it was especially soiled or anything.</span> <span id="s560">But I -- I -- you know, when you look back all those years and you don’t pay that much attention and it’s -- you don’t really recall all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: Yeah [inaudible].</span> <span id="s562">Hang on a second.</span> <span id="s563">This is the end of tape two, side A, Elizabeth Feldhusen.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: Okay, here we are.</span> <span id="s566">Hello, hello, hello, hello.</span> <span id="s567">When you were -- when you were in -- oh, I’m sorry, this is tape three, side B, Elizabeth Feldhusen.</span> <span id="s568">When you were in Austria and attending to the survivors at Gusen, I understand that there was also, nearby, the Mauthausen concentration camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: Yes, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: Were there nurses caring for people there also?</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A: Not that I know of.</span> <span id="s572">I really don’t know of any other nurses that ever worked with concentration patients.</span> <span id="s573">I don’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: Americans --</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: I don’t know of any, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: Huh.</span> <span id="s577">In -- Americans in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: Huh.</span> <span id="s580">I didn’t realize that.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: It would be interesting to find out if there were any others, but I never heard of any others and there may have been, but I don’t know of any, personally.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s583">When you would come back from your duty during the day, what would you all talk about at night?</span> <span id="s584">What was --</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: Oh my, that’s so many -- I guess we talked about our work.</span> <span id="s586">Because nurses tend to do that and so we probably did talk about what we saw and experiences during the day.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: Do you remember it being hard for people to cope with or was it just your --</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: No, I really don’t.</span> <span id="s589">I don’t really -- and -- how did you find out about us having a get together?</span> <span id="s590">Not through this Jeannie Striker?</span> <span id="s591">She’s down in Florida.</span> <span id="s592">Her name -- she’s married now, she has a different name.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: Ho -- How is that out of 40 nurses, so many of you have kept in touch over 50 years?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: What was it about that experience that made you all be so bonded together?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: Well, I think one thing was that we had lived together so closely.</span> <span id="s597">The whole time we were in Europe, until we got to Linz, we lived in these squad tents and they were always five or six of us in a tent.</span> <span id="s598">And when we were in England we lived in one house and we had to fit into that house.</span> <span id="s599">There were always quite a number of us in each room.</span> <span id="s600">So, you grew to be very close.</span> <span id="s601">I think if we probably all had our own rooms -- and yet, in my nurses training we had our own rooms and my class is still very close.</span> <span id="s602">We still -- in fact I go to all my -- my King’s County luncheons.</span> <span id="s603">We have one in Pennsylvania and we have one in New York City.</span> <span id="s604">I go to both of them.</span> <span id="s605">But most of the girls go to the one in Pennsylvania.</span> <span id="s606">So most of them have moved out of New York and live there in Pennsylvania.</span> <span id="s607">So -- but I think it’s the living closene -- and we all got along very well together.</span> <span id="s608">I really don’t know of any enmity between anybody.</span> <span id="s609">You know, ruffled feelings or anything.</span> <span id="s610">I think we’ve always gotten together.</span> <span id="s611">But I really -- I think I s -- have to pat myself on the back, because I think I started having us get together.</span> <span id="s612">And there was a -- in 1947, that was the big snowstorm and I had arranged for us to have luncheon down at a Candlelight restaurant in Brooklyn Heights, which was a lovely restaurant in a brownstone, and they gave you popovers -- the whol -- the whole dinner they kept coming out of the oven with these delicious popovers and -- and we had this get together and -- with the storm that we had, two people came down from Syracuse, Phyllis Law was one of them and Loreena, who passed away, was the other one.</span> <span id="s613">And Loreena says, “I was so amazed to see all that snow, because Syracuse has the snow usually.”</span> <span id="s614">But they didn’t have it and we were just snowed in.</span> <span id="s615">And our chief nurse just couldn’t get there, she called me.</span> <span id="s616">She says, “I can’t get the doors open.”</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: How many people were able to make that first reunion?</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: I think we had about 10 -- 10 or 11.</span> <span id="s619">And I believe we were expecting about 20, because they would be the people from the New York area, but the two came from Syracuse.</span> <span id="s620">And -- but it was the big snowstorm.</span> <span id="s621">And then they said that we had a reunion a-at Hotel Saint George Thet.</span> <span id="s622">I said, “I’m sure it was the Candlelight,” because I know the one was at the Candlelight and I almost think we had two at the Candlelight.</span> <span id="s623">And I kept calling the woman and -- who owned the restaurant and she says, “It’s perfectly all right,” cause I thought we’d be charged for all those dinners.</span> <span id="s624">And she said no, it’s perfectly understandable, you know, when people can’t get in.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: Sure, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: And so every time I was cr -- every time I had a cancellation, I’d call her.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: When you -- when you look back on your experience 50 years ago as a nurse and -- and during World War Two and especially that experience you had caring for the survivors of the concentration camp --</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: What is the lesson for you?</span> <span id="s630">Or, how do you think that changed your life in any way, or you as a person?</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: Well, I mean I was talking to the other girls earlier.</span> <span id="s632">I don’t know if you were there, but I mean what’s going on in today’s world.</span> <span id="s633">I don’t think we’ve learned our lessons at all.</span> <span id="s634">And I -- at that time, I felt just like the United Nations.</span> <span id="s635">We would all be getting along together and create an understanding.</span> <span id="s636">I’ve been a member of the United Nations for quite a number of years and when I lived in New York, I went to a lot of their activities, but it seems worse to me than ever, which I can’t understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Q: You were hopeful at the end of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: I was very hopeful, yeah, that -- and -- but I mean, it’s all within the last 10 years that things have changed.</span> <span id="s639">And it’s -- to me it’s so hard to understand, when we can all get along together and be happy.</span> <span id="s640">It’s very disillusioning to me.</span> <span id="s641">And you would think after that experience of the Holocaust that everything would have dramatically changed, but -- and now these skinheads that you read about.</span> <span id="s642">They’re -- they even have them in this country.</span> <span id="s643">I mean, nobody seems to appreciate what they have.</span> <span id="s644">And in this country you have more of the good life, than you have al-almost, you know, almost any place.</span> <span id="s645">And -- cause I’m very much against these people -- what is it?</span> <span id="s646">That rifle group?</span> <span id="s647">I think they all help to perpetuate these terrible things that are going on and I think things are going to get worse.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: Well, how do you think that, having witnessed what you witnessed, what kind of an impact did that have on you as a person, after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: Well, mm -- well, I think that -- you know, everybody said it can’t happen again, you know, it just can’t happen again.</span> <span id="s650">And you know, we had a chaplain and he gave us all the -- all these photographs.</span> <span id="s651">You probably saw them -- I don’t know whether you did or not.</span> <span id="s652">We all had a set of them.</span> <span id="s653">Horrible.</span> <span id="s654">But I mean, those photographs were -- I think were worse than anything I really saw.</span> <span id="s655">You know, the bodies and the pits and being buried and all this and that stuff.</span> <span id="s656">I think that we were sort of shielded from that and -- and really didn’t see as much as in those photographs.</span> <span id="s657">So, it’s hard to say.</span> <span id="s658">And I mean, I happen to be German and I have relatives over there.</span> <span id="s659">I have never talked to them about it.</span> <span id="s660">Well, they -- the younger ones, born way after, you know, they’re all about in their 30’s, but my cousin, she’s my second cousin, she’s about 65.</span> <span id="s661">I never ch -- brought it up to her, I never talked to her, cause I was sort of embarrassed and I didn’t know how to bring it up and so I never really said anything to her.</span> <span id="s662">And I had stayed with her parents once, when I first went to Europe.</span> <span id="s663">I stayed with her parents for almost a week -- five or six days.</span> <span id="s664">And they never really talked about the war, but -- and -- and in thir -- and in ‘58, you know, it wasn’t too far behind and they had one chair in the house and I don’t know how that came up, whether I said something, what a nice chair it was or not, I don’t recall and he said, “We were all out,” he said, “the children were in school,” and he and his wife -- he was at work and his wife was off someplace and when they came home, their house was just rubble.</span> <span id="s665">And he said, “I pulled that chair from the rubble.”</span> <span id="s666">He said, “It was the only thing that was any good.”</span> <span id="s667">And that’s all that was ever said.</span> <span id="s668">I never said anything more, never brought it up.</span> <span id="s669">So, well I mean that’s no joke, either.</span> <span id="s670">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: What about since -- since that time?</span> <span id="s672">Have you ever had a conversation with somebody where they tried to tell you that the Holocaust didn’t happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s674">It’s only what I have been reading in the paper.</span> <span id="s675">And I don -- really don’t know how they can believe that.</span> <span id="s676">I mean, when all the evidence is there.</span> <span id="s677">I -- I -- to me, I can’t see -- it just doesn’t match up at all.</span> <span id="s678">How can you deny something when you have all the evidence?</span> <span id="s679">The photographs and you can go over there and see it and everything else, I really -- I -- I -- I -- well, I think we just have a lot of crackpots or something or other.</span> <span id="s680">Just like those skinheads.</span> <span id="s681">They’re not all normal, they can’t be, to act the way they are and arousing all these anti feelings against people.</span> <span id="s682">Cause I grew up in New York where your friends are -- I had all kinds of -- I had black and white and Jewish and all and you just knew everybody and I -- a lot of my friends from childhood, I still keep up with and it’s -- you accept people for the way they are.</span> <span id="s683">And maybe people growing up in smaller towns aren’t exposed to different types of people to that extent, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q: Did you have Jewish friends growing up and in nursing school?</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s686">I have a friend in Lakewood, Lillian Sherr and -- and I always -- I say to Lillian, “How’d we ever get acquainted?”</span> <span id="s687">Because she’s about three or four years older than I am and she was working in the operating room.</span> <span id="s688">And we’re very good friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: Do you ever remember her or anybody else saying something to you about the difficulties that the Jewish people were having in Europe before the war, do you -- were you conscious of that at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s691">Now Lillian went into the army a -- but she was in Burma.</span> <span id="s692">And she will not speak about her army experiences.</span> <span id="s693">And lately I’ve been thinking about it.</span> <span id="s694">I wonder why -- because I always thought so many of my experiences were so interesting.</span> <span id="s695">But I once asked her about Burma.</span> <span id="s696">Sh -- a-and she’s different, you know.</span> <span id="s697">I should say -- I don’t want to -- she’d go like this, you know?</span> <span id="s698">She don’t want to.</span> <span id="s699">So I really don’t know what went on.</span> <span id="s700">She never talked about her army experiences.</span> <span id="s701">So it must have been a very unhappy experience for her, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: I don’t think they ever had anything to do with the native people.</span> <span id="s704">And I would think going to Burma must have -- just to see the country, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s706">This is the 50th anniversary this year, of the end of the war.</span> <span id="s707">Has that made you think about your experience more, or is it --</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: No, my -- someone asked me, “Aren’t you going to go to some of these reunions over in Europe?”</span> <span id="s709">And I said, “I have no desire to go.”</span> <span id="s710">And I don’t know of any -- I haven’t heard of anybody that I know that has gone, except one man I know.</span> <span id="s711">But he’s very active in military organizations and that, but otherwise I really don’t -- and I have no desire to go.</span> <span id="s712">I think maybe if a group of us had gone, that might have been something, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: Would you be interested, for example, in going back to Gusen or -- or go to li -- to Linz?</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A: Well, I’ve sort of wondered about it.</span> <span id="s715">I’ve been to Europe s-several times, but always with a group.</span> <span id="s716">When you’re on a tour, you can’t do what you want to do.</span> <span id="s717">But some of our people did go back and did -- I don’t think anybody in this group, you know, that’s here today, but I would say at least three people did go.</span> <span id="s718">And -- I’m trying to think who they were that did that.</span> <span id="s719">Woody might remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: But I really don’t recall, but -- and I know one person said, “Well, it seemed to be the same as it was when we were there.”</span> <span id="s722">And, but otherwise -- but I don’t have any burning desire to go.</span> <span id="s723">It was just a -- an unpleasant time of life and --</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: That’s how you think about it, as something you’d rather forget?</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s726">Yeah, I think so.</span> <span id="s727">Yeah, I believe so, it’s -- you know, and then sometimes I wonder why -- you know, rehashing everything.</span> <span id="s728">You know, what is the real outcome of that going to be?</span> <span id="s729">But I think the reason was so that it wouldn’t happen again.</span> <span id="s730">But -- but when you think of what people do to people, what’s going on today, I don’t think it’s had any influence whatsoever.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s732">Anything I didn’t ask you about that you would like to talk about or tell me about or --</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A: Well, no.</span> <span id="s734">It’s only that once in awhile something that’s said, you know, brings up another idea, but otherwise, just some funny incidences and I really -- I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: I think we covered the highlights.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: Okay, good.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: Unless you want to hear about my German prisoner of war that helped us in Gusen?</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: Course.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">A: I don’t always tell it, because some people don’t really think it’s -- anyhow, he was a very -- I don’t think he was more than 18 - 17 and he lost his meat can -- you know, that’s the -- it’s a two part dish -- I still have mine at home -- and you have your silverware on the inside and when you go to get something to eat, you open it up and you have two parts and they put the food in it.</span> <span id="s741">And then you wash it and put it together again.</span> <span id="s742">Well, he came on duty and he hung, I guess, a jacket and -- and his meat can on the back of a door -- happened to be a hook there.</span> <span id="s743">Well -- and then he came to me and he told me in German that his meat can was gone.</span> <span id="s744">And I said, “Are you sure you left it there?”</span> <span id="s745">And, yeah.</span> <span id="s746">So I started looking under everybody’s pillow.</span> <span id="s747">And I’m climbing on all these tiers and looking under.</span> <span id="s748">I finally found it.</span> <span id="s749">My God, he was practically kneeling every time I passed him.</span> <span id="s750">Cause he told me he’d be killed if he -- if it was found out that he lost it.</span> <span id="s751">Oh, he was so frightened, oh.</span> <span id="s752">Which is why I really worked very hard to find it.</span> <span id="s753">And I did find it.</span> <span id="s754">Oh, he was frantic.</span> <span id="s755">He was just a kid, you know.</span> <span id="s756">And we had German prisoners of war when I was at Fort Dupont and I had some funny experiences with them, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q: Before you went overseas?</span></p> <p><span id="s758">A: Before I went over.</span> <span id="s759">You know, we had 10,000 prisoners there at Fort Dupont and when we were on night duty, we worked from seven pm to seven am, 12 hours.</span> <span id="s760">And then you got an extra day off for that.</span> <span id="s761">You did that for two weeks.</span> <span id="s762">So the prisoners, when they -- when we were preparing for them, we had just a very small hospital with three wards and s -- and some private rooms.</span> <span id="s763">And the prisoners of war were at least a mile away.</span> <span id="s764">We had quite a big hospital there, but it was empty.</span> <span id="s765">So they put their ward as far away as you could go.</span> <span id="s766">How I wished I had roller skates.</span> <span id="s767">Cause you had to go down there and gave out -- you put out the medicines.</span> <span id="s768">I put them in all little medicine glasses with the name of the person.</span> <span id="s769">Cause we had a ward man who was German.</span> <span id="s770">He gave out all the medicines, he did everything except the narcotics and the injections.</span> <span id="s771">So he called me one night, it was pouring rain and he said, “We’re being flooded down here.”</span> <span id="s772">And -- because I could understand him, you see?</span> <span id="s773">And so -- and -- and one of the duties of the night nurse was to run across an open ramp into the nurses quarters and close all the windows.</span> <span id="s774">And we had these rainstorms that came up in Delaware in a second.</span> <span id="s775">And it just came down, you can’t imagine.</span> <span id="s776">And so I had just come back from the nurses quarters -- you ran into everybody’s room, closing windows -- and the telephone call came in.</span> <span id="s777">So I ran down there and they had a guard and he had a whole ring, like this, of keys.</span> <span id="s778">And -- and he -- well, anyhow, I said, “I got to find out what’s happening in here.”</span> <span id="s779">So I got in there and they had all the beds pulled to the center and the floor was wet.</span> <span id="s780">There were a couple of inches of water on the floors and everything, the bed linen was wet.</span> <span id="s781">I know I had to go back and get more bed linen, cause they didn’t have enough, because they didn’t use that much, you know, at one time.</span> <span id="s782">And -- and they got me a chair -- oh, and we had bars on all the windows.</span> <span id="s783">Not regular bars, but screening, that metal screening, each one with a lock and they were not in succession.</span> <span id="s784">So I’m looking for the key, got that window open, opened it, they close it, we locked that again.</span> <span id="s785">Go to the next window.</span> <span id="s786">By then somebody moved the chair, I got up on the chair, got that window o -- closed -- and the next one.</span> <span id="s787">So finally I said, “For heavens sakes, will you find the right key?</span> <span id="s788">Go down while I’m working on this window and you get that lock for that window.”</span> <span id="s789">Well, and we had one window next to another, we must have had 40 windows on that ward.</span> <span id="s790">Well, I can tell you, about -- af -- seven o’clock in the morning I was down in the office of the man that was in charge of that.</span> <span id="s791">And he got a -- heard from me.</span> <span id="s792">I says, “There is absolutely no sense to what you people have done.”</span> <span id="s793">I said, “First of all, you don’t need those metal screens on those windows, that’s asinine.”</span> <span id="s794">I said, “And if they get out of the window, how are they going to go further?”</span> <span id="s795">Because there were big bars and sc -- that curly --</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: Concertina wire?</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s798">I said, “How can anybody get over that?”</span> <span id="s799">And I said, “And where are they going to go if they get out?</span> <span id="s800">There isn’t any place.”</span> <span id="s801">I said, “They can’t get any food, nobody’ll have anything to do with them.”</span> <span id="s802">And the next night, they were all off.</span> <span id="s803">Everything was off those windows.</span> <span id="s804">That I remember vividly.</span> <span id="s805">Well, anyhow, while I was jumping from one chair to the other, one of them says, in German, he said, “She’s like the little old lady who lived in a shoe, she had so many children, she didn’t know what to do.”</span> <span id="s806">Well, I burst out laughing, I couldn’t help it.</span> <span id="s807">And I was supposed to be very stern, you see, they were our enemies.</span> <span id="s808">But I just couldn’t -- they were all young people, you know.</span> <span id="s809">I couldn’t help it.</span> <span id="s810">I was accused of being too friendly.</span> <span id="s811">I couldn’t help it.</span> <span id="s812">I was going with a fellow then and he said, “The word is that you’re too friendly.”</span> <span id="s813">I says, “I can’t help it.”</span> <span id="s814">I said, “They’re nice young men.”</span> <span id="s815">Most of them were very young.</span> <span id="s816">And there was one fellow that had -- had -- I think he had his appendix out.</span> <span id="s817">And -- and they -- they get morphine, you know, every four hours if they need it.</span> <span id="s818">So I prepared, up at my place -- we kept the -- the morphine and those drugs, you know, they didn’t have them down there.</span> <span id="s819">So I went down with my syringe and -- course Hans, as I remember, had called me and said he was in terrible pain.</span> <span id="s820">So I went down and the poor fellow, when he saw me, the sweat started coming and he was in awful pain.</span> <span id="s821">He -- and he’s inching away back toward the wall.</span> <span id="s822">He saw me with the syringe and I remember Hans said, “He’s -- he thinks you’re going to kill him.</span> <span id="s823">Put him to sleep or something.”</span> <span id="s824">So I’m trying to tell him, you know, this is for -- to help him.</span> <span id="s825">See, they were so -- so -- I mean the tales that we heard on our side, they also heard against us.</span> <span id="s826">So anyhow -- so I finally got him -- gave it to him.</span> <span id="s827">He was almost fighting me, you know.</span> <span id="s828">And he was in terrible pain.</span> <span id="s829">It was probably gas.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: So, we’re -- we had a -- a remedy that I used to use.</span> <span id="s832">What was it now?</span> <span id="s833">Something old fashioned that had two things and I got it from the pharmacy.</span> <span id="s834">And all they needed was a little sip of that and it brought the gas up and it worked miracles.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">Q: I think we’re done, Elizabeth.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">A: Yeah, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: Think so.</span> <span id="s838">This is the end of the interview with Elizabeth Feldhusen.</span> <span id="s839">This is tape three, side B.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">End of Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Conclusion of Interview</span></p></body></html>
