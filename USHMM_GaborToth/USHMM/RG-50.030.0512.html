measurements.</span> <span id="s593">And I cut it, and sort of put it together, whatever.</span> <span id="s594">And she came for a fitting, she tried on this coat, she says, oh, your coat is just like -- like she wants it, she had -- she -- how could you do -- how did you do it?</span> <span id="s595">I says, I don’t myself how that -- th-that’s what I started, that’s -- I don’t know, it came

see.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: -- so many.</span> <span id="s605">But he was happy that this was -- he could -- he could satisfy the customer.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: Right.</span></p>

grabbing people to work.</span> <span id="s814">I -- I went to my place where I worked, but a couple -- once okay, twice I couldn’t go farther.</span> <span id="s815">You know, at that time I said, I’m not going.</span> <span id="s816">Every time I went to work, the nat -- [indecipherable] Nazis came to Lódz.</span> <span id="s817">First of all they had their own.</span> <span id="s818">And secondly there wasn’t any [indecipherable] was a German city, and like all Nazis were full of either Nazi -- all kind of formations civi -- civilians and go -- uniform.</span> <span id="s819">Whenever I walked to the street, and tried to go to work, I was beaten [indecipherable] direct to work, they’re being -- taking over offices and things [indecipherable] they want to clean up, so they grab people, Jewish people to work, and they kept us for the whole day.</span> <span id="s820">We worked, we worked.</span> <span id="s821">So I got -- I can’t -- it does no use to go to work, cause you -- you don’t go anything, you know, you just get yourself in trouble.</span> <span id="s822">So I didn’t go to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s824">We have -- excuse me, Henry, we have to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">End of Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Beginning Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Q: All right, so the Germans come in.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: And they’re so --</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: Occupied.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: -- cause -- occupied.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A: Occupied.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A: Renamed that city Litzmannstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">Q: And doesn’t a ghetto start pretty quickly?</span></p> <p><span id="s836">A: Well, they have been talking, so right away -- talking about the ghetto, talki -- talking about.</span> <span id="s837">I mean it -- it -- I think it take -- took a little -- some times, and I wasn’t that long over there.</span> <span id="s838">The -- as -- I couldn’t go to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A: I couldn’t do any -- I couldn’t go to work because I was beaten up few times in go to work, so I s -- gave up to go to work, because -- my friend -- I have a -- I had a friend in the neighborhood, Tanchim, my friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: Tanuchim?</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A: Tanchim, yes.</span> <span id="s843">And he wa -- he made it to Warsaw when -- where -- with -- with the crowd that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Q: That first time?</span></p> <p><span id="s845">A: I-In the first time, but when Warsaw was holding on for two weeks and then they had to give up, so he came back to Lódz.</span> <span id="s846">He lived in our neighborhood and we talking -- we met -- you know, we been going on and talk.</span> <span id="s847">The meanwhile we listen to the sort of kind of rumors, the news.</span> <span id="s848">Not the rumors, but the news was that German -- that England and France, they are helping Poland -- gonna help Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">A: They gon -- they declared war [indecipherable] Germany there, because they were involved with the previous agreement of friends -- friendship or something --</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: -- and they had to come to help Poland.</span> <span id="s853">And then we became in a little bit hopeful, became that this war isn’t going to last long.</span> <span id="s854">But I -- I myself, you know, remember that Great Britain was a big power.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">A: The -- the -- they -- the world big power, world power, and France is a big power, they too will -- will attack them from the other side, from the -- the German will have to pull back or something, or otherwise they’ll be in -- in trouble.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">Q: So that’s what you felt?</span></p> <p><span id="s858">A: That’s what I thought.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A: That’s -- that’s what I thought.</span> <span id="s861">Little we knew how -- how weak they were and how little they could do.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: But we didn’t know that they really not capable, I thought they were really strong.</span> <span id="s864">And we thought this cannot last long the war, cause with the help of England and o -- and France, they will not go further.</span> <span id="s865">Where we were occupation took place, they occupied all Poland, and [indecipherable] is sort of coming with the idea we should go east because the war, she says a lot of people went to the east [indecipherable] Russia, took half of part of Poland, and so you figured for the time being, til they -- til they have to pull out -- back, we will stay in -- and my mother there agreed with me, she says, go.</span> <span id="s866">Of course, you know, it’s -- it’s -- there’s no other way, there’s no -- there’s no solution here now.</span> <span id="s867">Pretty soon the [indecipherable] be such a help that pretty soon the -- the situation will change, since France and England got the -- stepped into the war.</span> <span id="s868">So we got -- I didn’t take lot equipment, whatever you could put on, two pair of pants, and things like th -- th-the underwears, we -- everything you could put on, you don’t take lu-luggage or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: And Tanchim and myself, we took --</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Q: Was it -- l-let me ask you something.</span> <span id="s872">Was that a difficult --</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Q: Was that difficult to do, to leave your mother and your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s875">A: Is what?</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: Was it difficult, that day?</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: Was it difficult?</span> <span id="s878">It was a little -- it -- I think it was a sort of general kind of -- a lot of people were doing the same, so you -- you don’t question it too much, and you figured this -- it’s a temporary thing, or something like that.</span> <span id="s879">Because I couldn’t go to work --</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: -- you couldn’t help them, and they didn’t work, because of the -- so, whatever it is, my sister and my mother stayed home.</span> <span id="s882">And I took off with Tanchim.</span> <span id="s883">I made the trip to go to the -- to the -- to Malkinia.</span> <span id="s884">Malkinia was the last stop to the Russian border.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">A: At the Russian border --</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">A: -- that was the only part of dry land where the -- the other parts of the border had the boke -- that river, and to go to the river is more difficult, so people took the easy way, is go to the dry land, to the ri -- there’s a no man’s land, they said -- I mean, I didn't -- we didn’t know then what’s -- what’s going on over there, because we went to -- we couldn’t go direct, we had to go to Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">A: And take another train.</span> <span id="s891">We couldn’t ride the train --</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: So first you went to --</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A: -- Jews couldn’t ride the train, we had already then, by then, the -- the yellow lata, the lel -- yellow patch.</span> <span id="s894">You di --</span></p> <p><span id="s895">Q: You did already?</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A: Oh, we did already wear -- that was right away fr -- right from the first day, we had to wear the yellow p -- the yellow patch, yellow lata, and [indecipherable] we took off the latas, the --</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Q: You took them off?</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: Took them off, because Jews were not allowed to ride on the train and we couldn’t get tickets, so could recognize us Jewish, so Tanchim’s girlfriend, a girl was so different, she put on the scarf, and the thing what -- ah.</span> <span id="s899">She went over in the -- bought -- bought two tickets for us, and we got a train to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s900">So the train was at night, th-the right -- you know, it was good because it was dark.</span> <span id="s901">Whenever the cont -- the German control came up on -- in the car, there were a lot of people, we sort of pushed ourselves into the -- in the toilets while they were checking passports, pa -- checking the I.D.’s or something, the German patrols, we were in the -- in the toilets, a-and then we came out.</span> <span id="s902">Anyhow, he made it --</span></p> <p><span id="s903">Q: Did your I.D.’s have a J in it?</span> <span id="s904">Did they know that -- they knew you were Jewish from your I.D.?</span></p> <p><span id="s905">A: They knew, they -- yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q: There was a --</span></p> <p><span id="s907">A: Jude -- J -- Jude.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q: Jude, there was, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: Then we got to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s910">I had a distant cousin and we stayed overnight over there.</span> <span id="s911">And Warsaw was a different -- it wasn’t the Third Reich, it was the Polish government, the Polish police and things like that, and people were not that -- sort of under the impression -- under the same -- it wasn’t the same kind of government, it -- it -- temporary.</span> <span id="s912">They sort of -- there were a lot of bla -- black marketing and people -- people were running around, and my cousin -- s -- I stayed with my cousin overnight one day -- overnight.</span> <span id="s913">The next day we took the train to Malkinia, cause there was a direct train.</span> <span id="s914">And that was a lot of -- there were a lot of Jewish people in the train because everybody was going to the border, to the Ru-Russian border.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">A: And the -- at the -- at the end of the Malkinia, the train stopped and we -- everybody -- they said, everybody out, because that’s the last stop.</span> <span id="s917">So, we can’t stay on the train.</span> <span id="s918">So everybody has to leave and you couldn’t leave because there was rows of S.S., both sides, and you cou -- they wouldn’t let you go no place til the train pulls out, and they li-lined up everybody, all these people in -- in -- in a line -- in lines, and marched away.</span> <span id="s919">And took us into a -- half a mile maybe, to this in -- their place -- their place, I don’t know, a place, some place.</span> <span id="s920">It was a courtyard, big yard -- big courtyard and they put us in -- into this courtyard and S.S. guy -- S -- S.S. guys around us, you know, marching back and forth round the people and they all gave us orders.</span> <span id="s921">First they said -- put up our hands in the air.</span> <span id="s922">We started in the morning, we stay there all day long.</span> <span id="s923">We didn't know ma -- S.S. what’s going on, what this -- kind of game this is.</span> <span id="s924">Towards the evening, about -- I guess what [indecipherable] about four o’clock in the evening, in -- towards the evening, I didn't even know when they start taking in people into the -- they’re all around w-were barracks, small barracks in the courtyard.</span> <span id="s925">And when I di -- all people who mar -- is -- were taken, so now our time is to go into this separate room that -- that lead us -- they let us come to the end -- toward the end of this place, there’s a bar -- a barrack, a wooden barrack and we going into this -- to go into this place.</span> <span id="s926">I don’t know -- I didn’t know what -- what’s for, everybody in.</span> <span id="s927">As we got into this barrack, the hall -- the first hall is s -- low tables like that, a lot of tables, low like this, about 10 people at each table, hours we have to stand around, and here cames the S.S. man with the worker here, the man, he says, give up everything what you have, all the valuables and money.</span> <span id="s928">Put this on the table.</span> <span id="s929">He says, those who wouldn’t, and you have hidden someplace, we’ll find it.</span> <span id="s930">You’ll get shot.</span> <span id="s931">You’ll be shot.</span> <span id="s932">And that’s all.</span> <span id="s933">Well, there were some people there, there were some people not [indecipherable] but most people, they put out everything, watches, what -- everything, jewelry, yeah, whatever.</span> <span id="s934">I didn’t have mut -- money, I had one 50 zlotys my mother gave me, says, you need it, have something, it’s not much of money.</span> <span id="s935">So I had sewed it in -- in a -- in a place in the coat --</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: -- which, I mean, if you look good, if you try to, you maybe -- but it’s a little paper money, and they’re not going to y -- after they cleaned up the tables, whatever they have, and now you’re going to check to con -- we’ll see if you didn’t hide it, we gon -- to search you.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">A: There was another table, and -- a big one, and an S.S. man to each table.</span> <span id="s940">He says come over, and I -- I didn’t move so fast, he had a cane with a round handle.</span> <span id="s941">He took his cane with the -- pulled me with the --</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q: The hook?</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: -- the neck -- no, the candle he put -- the cane put as my -- around my neck and pulled me over to his -- to hi -- closer, that I wasn’t close enough, to search me.</span> <span id="s944">And he [indecipherable] says, open your coat.</span> <span id="s945">I open my coat, I had a good coat on, you know, I made it for myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">A: And I had a good shirt on, and another pair of pants, and another -- I been dressed up okay [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s948">So he tried to -- he says to me, where did you hide the money?</span> <span id="s949">I says, I have no money.</span> <span id="s950">A watch?</span> <span id="s951">No, I don’t wear watches.</span> <span id="s952">So he didn’t think long, he looked at me, and he took that cane and he gave me over -- hit me over twice, over my head, and blood started, came down my face, and I was [indecipherable] and I stand s-stiff, and I don’t move.</span> <span id="s953">I -- he says, now you gonna give me the money, or gonna gi -- you gonna get the other -- you gonna get again the same thing.</span> <span id="s954">I said, I don’t have money.</span> <span id="s955">He says to me, [indecipherable] you was tailor, where did you hide the money?</span> <span id="s956">You know, I did not tell him I’m a tailor, but he says, you were a tailor, you know, you -- where did you hide the money?</span> <span id="s957">I says, I didn't hide it, I don’t have it.</span> <span id="s958">He gave me another hit and go.</span> <span id="s959">And as -- and he gave me -- and had to go out.</span> <span id="s960">On the way out everybody was -- those who were checked were lined up to go out.</span> <span id="s961">At the way out on this -- there was a sole of -- sort of a walk, and the both sides were S.S. people with sticks, or pipes, or whatever -- whatever you had in the hand, and you have to go through and they hit you.</span> <span id="s962">So I didn’t have nothing, I put my hands over my head, you know, you just protect -- I had already hit my -- over the head, so I put -- protect my head and I s -- kept running and they been hitting both sides.</span> <span id="s963">Finally we got out.</span> <span id="s964">He let us go out, we came in into the no man’s land, the no man’s land between the Soviets and the German.</span> <span id="s965">There were so many people, masses of people, women and children.</span> <span id="s966">And the Russian guard wouldn’t let through.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">Q: Wouldn’t let anybody through?</span></p> <p><span id="s968">A: No.</span> <span id="s969">One [indecipherable] us through and then people with kids come and beg, and n-nothing helps, nobody went through, nobody can do, oh, wa -- they say we have to ask -- we have to formally ask for permission and we have to return then, if you get the permission, then you -- if you get a permit, we’ll let you through.</span> <span id="s970">So days -- there were 14 days on that cold winter November days, and snow and rain.</span> <span id="s971">So the only thing we had, some peddlers have bread to sell, so there was some bread and [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s972">That’s all we could get.</span> <span id="s973">And day by day we talked to [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s974">On the 14th day we saw some, you know, [indecipherable] in the morning.</span> <span id="s975">It was a nice morning and the -- wasn’t snowing and raining.</span> <span id="s976">We saw in the distance that some people s -- go through, and they sort of disappear, they go into the woods.</span> <span id="s977">On the other side were wooded areas where the Russian guards were there.</span> <span id="s978">So I said, maybe that is the good way.</span> <span id="s979">So we thought this is probably smugglers, which they know and -- where to -- where there is a better passage.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">A: So we did follow them, we went through the border, and nothing, nobody check.</span> <span id="s982">I mean, no guards or nothing, you know, cause they knew whether it -- it was bribe somebody or something, I don’t know, the smugglers maybe they have a way of bribing guards or whatever.</span> <span id="s983">We didn’t see any guards and we went toward the [indecipherable] and --</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Q: Did you know where you were going?</span> <span id="s985">Did you -- I mean, did you have a destination?</span> <span id="s986">You weren't sure?</span></p> <p><span id="s987">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">Q: You just wanted to get to the Russian side.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s990">Well, the next town we know is Bialystok.</span></p> <p><span id="s991">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">A: The big town.</span> <span id="s993">But this was a small town we came over to, Bora, and in a few kilmatersa -- ki -- kilometers like that, there was a s-station, the train station, we took tr -- we took the train and we came to Bialystok, which wasn’t far.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">A: Bialystok was a town wall -- wall to wall refugees, people from the other side, every [indecipherable] full of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s997">A: Full.</span> <span id="s998">You couldn’t go into a house if you -- if you wanted to go ask for a cu -- for a drink of -- cup of water, or a glass of water, they wouldn’t let you in the house.</span> <span id="s999">They put -- they put -- they got water out to you, a glass of water, they gave you a glass of water and that’s it.</span> <span id="s1000">Or a cup of water.</span> <span id="s1001">This -- you know, they were afraid to let somebody in the house.</span> <span id="s1002">They didn’t know who it is, and we looked poor, something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">A: They looked -- we looked, you know, bloody and -- and I-I mean there’s muddy, and -- muddy and bloody and so everything [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1005">So we walked around and we met some people on the street, you know [indecipherable] some people we knew from Lódz, or -- nobody had these -- a solution of what to do.</span> <span id="s1006">They were registering -- the government registered people to go to coal mines to work.</span> <span id="s1007">If you wor -- they say, if you register, we can, in a week or so, or two weeks, you might get the -- you go to work.</span> <span id="s1008">Well, I really didn't want to go to the coal mines [indecipherable] then we didn’t go too far, and now soon we gonna go back home, so we had -- don’t want to go so far up in the [indecipherable] in the coal mines.</span> <span id="s1009">And so there was no place, so we got -- the evening -- towards the evening, there was no place where to go to sleep.</span> <span id="s1010">So I went a shul.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">A: And we slept in the shul, on a bench.</span> <span id="s1013">And the next day we go again out in the street, [indecipherable] again the people, they come in the evening -- we come in the evening to [indecipherable] where we slept, some like that, some other people came and they s -- they took our place.</span> <span id="s1014">[indecipherable] it’s not mine, you know, I couldn’t, you know, how -- how could you -- so I had to walk out, we walked out in the streets, we start walking the street.</span> <span id="s1015">We didn’t have -- we have no place where to go.</span> <span id="s1016">So we figured, well maybe we should take a tra -- the trains were running, should take a train to the next small town, somewheres, whatever it is, another -- another 50 - 70 miles, maybe it’s better there, there aren’t that many people over there.</span> <span id="s1017">Here, everybody sticks to one place.</span> <span id="s1018">So we got to the station, to the train station, we get -- they wait -- waiting in line for tickets, and the man, a Jewish man [indecipherable] is behind us and he looks at us, says where you going?</span> <span id="s1019">I said, we’re going next town.</span> <span id="s1020">What’s the matter, he says, you got relatives there?</span> <span id="s1021">So why you -- what kind of che -- what you do?</span> <span id="s1022">I said, we’re tailors.</span> <span id="s1023">We all of u -- we all of us were tailors, three of us.</span> <span id="s1024">[indecipherable] me and Tanchim, we met a guy, one guy, another friend of ours on the border, we took him along, so we’re three of us.</span> <span id="s1025">Oh, tailors, he says, I’m going to a town where my daughter lives and I’m sure it’s a better town than here, it’s a little further, and you’ll be better off.</span> <span id="s1026">Y-You’re tailors, I’m sure you’ll get work over there, you’ll get settled down, things like that.</span> <span id="s1027">Well, it’s okay, we’ll go with -- we go with you.</span> <span id="s1028">No, he says, we’ll go with you.</span> <span id="s1029">Why yi -- how co -- we don’t have where to sleep, so -- where to go, where to stay, with whom.</span> <span id="s1030">So he says, for two guys, my daughter has a little sofa -- a sofa in the li -- I’ll give you the sofa, and you’ll [indecipherable] the third one, we’ll find another place, so the two of you -- well, it’s a big -- a good deal, two of us [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1031">So we all agreed.</span> <span id="s1032">We went with him and we landed in the town of Baranovich, and as he promised, we got to his daughter at night, and -- and he told her that he brought two -- two guests, you gotta give them where to sleep.</span> <span id="s1033">So he give us the soft and two of us slept the sofa and then my third one, Tanchim had -- he went to a -- to the shul, the next -- was

Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">A: Refugees.</span> <span id="s1199">So they start to have -- make him citizenship.</span> <span id="s1200">Alre -- a passport.</span> <span id="s1201">If you get a passport -- you know, every citizen over there got a passport.</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">A: If you get a passport, you’re citizen, and therefore you -- you -- you can go to work, or you can -- you can be treated -- I mean, treated as a citizen, you don’t have to -- people live without -- oh, they have to co -- have -- they had to have control

they don’t -- they don’t know who is here, who is there, so they declared the citiz -- if they wa -- if they -- to next -- to the summer -- well, after six months or something -- three months, they ask all the people, the refugees to come and get a s -- a pass -- a citizenship.</span> <span id="s1206">Well, we got to the office, everyone was called in individually to this offi -- to the office, and declared what you goin -- what you expect to be, you know, you gonna get a citizen, you gonna become citizen, and you can go to work, you can work or we will get you work, we’ll -- you wanted the government’s protection.</span> <span id="s1207">And so a lot of people came with -- by themselves, without wife, they left the wife and kids over in -- back home.</span> <span id="s1208">Mothers [indecipherable] mother, you see.</span> <span id="s1209">So when they came out from the sa -- ask them what they ask you questions, you said th -- the guy is, I ask him, I said -- they ask me to -- to become citizen, so if you -- and gave me the -- the rules, if you’re citizens -- if you’re a citizen -- in other words, you can’t go back to Poland, you cannot bring your family, a lot of restrictions.</span> <span id="s1210">Now, there was one thing, you can’t go back and you can’t bring your family.</span> <span id="s1211">So a lot of the people didn’t accept that and they came out and they says, well I wouldn’t leave my wife and kids home, and I will say hey, I don’t want to stay here.</span> <span id="s1212">So a-at the end, if you don’t accept the citizenship, you got to give them in -- a place where you want to go, sort of like a nice [indecipherable] want to go to America, you want to go to -- to -- well, maybe we want to see -- they put it on, but it doesn’t matter

I was trying to go back home and the borders, they were really tight.</span> <span id="s1222">It was hard to get through.</span> <span id="s1223">So I came back and I -- I mean t -- I went to the border [indecipherable] and I couldn’t get through.</span> <span id="s1224">So I came back and -- and when I asked for citizenship, I didn’t take the ci -- I didn’t take the citizenship.</span> <span id="s1225">And after some times -- after a few weeks, a week or so, they too -- they round up all the people that didn’t take citizenship, they put them in the trains -- in the freight trains is -- to go to send them away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">Q: And where?</span> <span id="s1227">Which direction?</span> <span id="s1228">To si --</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">A: Out into Siberia or

ena -- illegal or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">A: So I avoid to go out, as I don’t wanted to be arrested.</span> <span id="s1241">If you have -- if you check -- if you -- they check you and they -- you have no passport, and -- so after the transports went away -- went east, they -- all the trains and in two days later, they s -- gave a chance, a second chance, those who didn’t get the passport who missed the train, in other words, you can get now the citizenship, the passports.</span> <span id="s1242">Well, then I had no choice and I took the pas -- took a passport, and became a citizen.</span> <span id="s1243">So, whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">A: Whatever it is.</span></p> <p><span

place at home, from the country.</span> <span id="s1415">So we went back to Baranovich, finally.</span> <span id="s1416">And we dug shelters and the bombing was daily and -- and the -- the news, the

id="s1431">A: But they were lies, they wouldn’t really -- it was just the opposite.</span> <span id="s1432">So, it was really when we start to, in towards the evening, you saw a little bit change in the people were sort of running around too much like -- like undecided what to do, like in running to the station, to the railroad station.</span> <span id="s1433">And my tal -- friend Tanchim is running to the railroad station, he says, I’m going.</span> <span id="s1434">And I was going out in the streets to find out some other people, what to do.</span> <span id="s1435">Are they going really to the evacuate?</span> <span id="s1436">Are they going to the railroad station to get a train to go back east?</span> <span id="s1437">So we met some people, refugees coming from the border.</span> <span id="s1438">They say what do you -- what are you sitting here?</span> <span id="s1439">We are being chased by the Germans here.</span> <span id="s1440">German forces are chasing us.</span> <span

coming through.</span> <span id="s1453">Huge armies, strong.</span> <span id="s1454">And the first day we didn’t see, but right away they came at us, along with the -- they start looking, and you

found, little valuable things, they took it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">Q: They took it.</span> <span id="s1461">We have to stop the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">End of Tape Four</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">Beginning Tape Five</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1465">On the last tape you began to talk about the German occupation when they first -- when they first came in, and what that was like for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">A: You’re talking about in -- in Baranovich --</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">A: -- the sa -- the Soviet --</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">Q: After --</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">A: -- the German Soviet war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">Q: Right, right, 1941</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">A: 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">A: That’s what I -- we had a vacation.</span> <span id="s1475">When I -- from our --</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">A: -- the factory we worked was closed, we went on vacation.</span> <span id="s1478">And on the vacation we just saw the planes and things like that.</span> <span id="s1479">We didn’t know until about two o’clock -- 12 o’clock when we came home, we heard the speech officially, when they announced that Germany attacked, and then we rushed home.</span> <span id="s1480">We rushed home, back to Baranovich.</span> <span id="s1481">Trains were loaded already, people were running from all over, from the countryside to the ci -- to the town.</span> <span id="s1482">Baranovich was the nearest town, which we lived, so we went back.</span> <span id="s1483">Coming back was really -- the town -- the situation of early war time.</span> <span id="s1484">[indecipherable] were bombing, and ai-air attacks and things like that.</span> <span id="s1485">You have the dir -- we dug a shelter in the backyard.</span> <span id="s1486">We went to the shelters when the fliers came.</span> <span id="s1487">And we listened to the radio -- to the radio, official radio.</span> <span id="s1488">They had it placed all over in the places, in the public places where we could hear the news.</span> <span id="s1489">So they really sa -- misinformed us, you know, the agency, the Soviet agency, they had said that they are be -- beating back the enemy, and that will -- it’s -- wasn’t true, it was -- they were right here, next door, and then probably we wouldn’t -- didn’t rush to evacuate, to go -- to run away.</span> <span id="s1490">It does -- til it was too late.</span> <span id="s1491">The bomb -- the trains were bombed, and we -- they -- they couldn’t go, and walking, we walked until these planes, they shoot us -- shoot on us and -- and so we had to go back.</span> <span id="s1492">And going back is -- you have to settle -- we stayed in a place, in a -- a home, because the war -- at a friend’s uncle’s house, which he lived there, in -- at his house.</span> <span id="s1493">So he had a room, a lot of room, so one room he gave us, because he figured they wouldn’t let him have the whole house anyhow.</span> <span id="s1494">So one room we -- our -- our guys, the [indecipherable] there, stayed there in that room, and til we’ll settle, we know what’s going on for the -- they had the -- meanwhile, the SS and the Judenrat, there was already Judenrat ap-appointed, and the Juden Altesten, the Juden ep -- president, it -- it was called the Juden Altesten.</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">Q: So that was pretty fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">Q: That was pretty fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">A: Fa -- right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">A: It -- it was -- was right away ap-appointed and that’s it.</span> <span id="s1501">You don’t know wa -- and he -- the -- they were talking about a ghetto, and what -- while they talk [indecipherable] were talking.</span> <span id="s1502">Meanwhile they asked for -- they put the -- the say -- co-collecting valuables from the Jews.</span> <span id="s1503">So they gave us -- gave orders to deliver, let’s say, five pounds of gold -- I mean, I don’t know five pounds or two pounds, silver, everyth -- or metal, money, you know, currency.</span> <span id="s1504">They want dollars, they want pounds, all foreign currencies.</span> <span id="s1505">And -- and this had to be delivered in -- meanwhile, they start already asking for workers -- workers.</span> <span id="s1506">So the Judenrat was appointed [indecipherable] they needed workers for some project, we didn’t know what.</span> <span id="s1507">So we were not the ci-citizen, you know, I mean, it’s not a citizen from Baranovich, you know, we -- we were refugees, so we were the first ones to go.</span> <span id="s1508">So we went to this work, and then we start working, our three guys, and -- the three friends of ours went to work, and this was at the Air Force, German Air Force had a base, and they did rebuild -- not rebuild, but extend the airport.</span> <span id="s1509">And it was the Polish -- old Polish airport, but the -- since the Air Force is -- is big, that they need more s -- more runways and more things like that.</span> <span id="s1510">So they took 300 people from us, from -- from Jewish -- from the ghetto, which was not the ghetto yet, but [indecipherable] Jewish people already had to supply workers before the ghetto started.</span> <span id="s1511">And they had 300 non-Jewish people working.</span> <span id="s1512">So there was about 600 people working at this airfield to rebuild -- to extend the airfor -- rebuild the airfor -- the air force -- the airfield.</span> <span id="s1513">And I worked a terrible job, I had a terrible job in the -- to re -- unload the cement, loose cement in a barn when they -- they put the trains in a -- they lo -- they tr -- the trains went into a -- gathered into a barn, a big barn and they had loose cement on the -- on the platforms, and it has to be removed from the -- from the train because that train has to go again.</span> <span id="s1514">It’s just loose, this --</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">Q: How did you do it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">A: It was so terrible work, you know, with this -- I -- I felt that I wouldn’t last long really, at this work, it’s so hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">Q: Did you do it with a shovel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">A: With a shovel, but the -- the dust went -- that -- that cement was full in the air --</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">A: Well, we worked, we had no -- this was -- this is the work.</span> <span id="s1521">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">Q: And who chose you?</span> <span id="s1523">Was it the Judenrat who chose you, or the Germans who cho -- how [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">A: Actually, Judenrat wants workers.</span> <span id="s1525">They -- and since we s-sort of were refugees, we the first ones to go because the others had families and thanks to that we have no families, so I -- I didn’t mind.</span> <span id="s1526">I mean, we went to work.</span> <span id="s1527">So what is there -- we can’t be -- we can’t avoid that, we going to have to -- sooner or later we figured we’ll have to go -- we’ll do something.</span> <span id="s1528">Anyhow, we couldn’t say no.</span> <span id="s1529">As we worked -- as I worked ever d -- at this job [indecipherable] time, I really got sick from that.</span> <span id="s1530">So at -- one morning the foreman, you know, we had this guy, Jewish guy was the foreman from 300 people.</span> <span id="s1531">In the morning he divided people different -- different play -- jobs.</span> <span id="s1532">There were electricians, there were carpenters, you know.</span> <span id="s1533">So one day he ask for a tailor, who is a tailor.</span> <span id="s1534">So I raise my hands, where are tailors, better to work than that.</span> <span id="s1535">So I said -- then I start working as a tailor and as soon they open -- they gave me a room and a machine, and [indecipherable] set up a tailor room where I could work.</span> <span id="s1536">Was a different cha -- a big change.</span> <span id="s1537">I felt, you know, now I could rec -- could -- could hold on til -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1538">We worked there and it was in the beginning not bad.</span> <span id="s1539">I mean, as slave work, we didn’t get paid.</span> <span id="s1540">He told us, you are slave workers.</span> <span id="s1541">You can’t get -- you get -- don’t get paid.</span> <span id="s1542">The others, Friday got -- they got paid.</span> <span id="s1543">The o -- the o --</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">Q: The airfield people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">Q: What -- what other people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1547">A: The other -- the o -- non-Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">Q: Ah, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">A: Non-Jewish people --</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">Q: Got paid.</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">A: -- there was 300, they got paid.</span> <span id="s1552">And we, we [indecipherable] the workers, but not paid.</span> <span id="s1553">So -- and I s-set up and it was better than cement work.</span> <span id="s1554">I had all the guy -- all these officers came in for work -- kind of work, pants, sometimes they had uniforms, and sometimes civilian clothes, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1555">There were so many changes.</span> <span id="s1556">They wore in the beginning civilian clothes and then they had a uniform.</span> <span id="s1557">So anyway, there was always work to do.</span> <span id="s1558">And I also do so -- did some work for the Air Force people itself, you know, the military, because when they came they saw sh -- they [indecipherable] a ta -- a tailor, they want him -- e-everybody had an -- they needed.</span> <span id="s1559">And I all of a sudden [indecipherable] later, a German officer who -- I said, without his permission I cannot do out w-work.</span> <span id="s1560">They got it.</span> <span id="s1561">He gave them permission.</span> <span id="s1562">They gave -- they -- I should work -- I worked for y -- al-all other officers in the Air Force.</span> <span id="s1563">In the Air Force -- course the Air Force building was right near -- nearby, and a lot of officers.</span> <span id="s1564">In the beg --</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">Q: So you’re living there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">Q: You’re living there, near the airfield?</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">A: We didn’t live there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">Q: No?</span> <span id="s1570">Where were you living?</span> <span id="s1571">In the same --</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">A: We were -- we were -- before we start to get -- I still lived this --</span></p> <p><span id="s1573">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">A: -- friend’s house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">Q: You still were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">A: Yeah, we’re there, but slowly we moved to the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1577">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">A: What I still -- we still went to work in the morning and we came back, you know, with the -- we had the I.D. card and when they put together this ghetto, there was a -- a gar -- a guard in -- in the front of the gate, and you gotta show -- and you showed him the -- to go to work and then they come to work, ya -- they -- or they searched you if you have a package, they searched, and to -- so I went on with that, I worked, and we helped ourselves a little bit because we have people coming in, different people, different kind of people, nobody checked me what I do, or what [indecipherable] I do.</span> <span id="s1579">I did some side work.</span> <span id="s1580">So I made -- you know, to go through [indecipherable] to -- to make something to go -- you know, people s -- usually everybody gave something.</span> <span id="s1581">You know, no matter -- the officers, they -- to -- the guy around me -- had one guy who was a ta -- a tall guy, a big strong guy, he was -- he was so mean, and when he came in to have work done and he always brought something.</span> <span id="s1582">Bread, butter, and things like that, and he was in charge [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1583">So -- so rem -- he [indecipherable] in a way that you could -- he could have a -- you know, stay in [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1584">He didn’t bother us.</span> <span id="s1585">I worked, nobody came in to check me, what I wad -- what I work, but I wa -- they were -- just want the acceptance if they came -- outside people, if they came in, they want to have them h-have the um -- our -- pi -- pi -- our officers should give them permission.</span> <span id="s1586">They got it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">Q: Are they killing Jews at this point, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">A: At the what?</span> <span id="s1589">At the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">Q: In the area.</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">A: In the area?</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1593">Do you know anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">A: When you first -- you saw the ghetto, well, people went out to work, and this was one guy who -- a tailor who had his own shop, and it ha -- got in a -- when he -- they want him to give up the shop.</span> <span id="s1595">He had a tailor -- his store, with the business.</span> <span id="s1596">They want him to give up the business because he is a -- so he formally gave up the business to a worker of his.</span> <span id="s1597">I-In other words, it should have a -- a -- put a -- it’s under his name is the facto -- what is the business, but he took the -- he di -- he took the profit, the money or whatever it is they made.</span> <span id="s1598">And that was finally wa -- who -- whose told the -- I mean, the authorities, they s -- they says what he does, he was arrested and he was hanged, publicly on the pla -- on the -- before the ghetto was closed, he -- they asked everybody -- the people to go and see it.</span> <span id="s1599">You know, that’s to scare the people up, you know, like the -- not to do anything on their own -- on the -- on the -- what they wanted is [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1600">Well, anyhow, these things occurred and they also here and there, when they need workers or they need people, they’ve been taken away, they never -- we never saw them back.</span> <span id="s1601">So that was until the ghetto was in a -- a -- still a set up and they had a one meter -- they gave us one meter per person.</span> <span id="s1602">One meter space in a -- in a -- you have a room like that, and you can put eight, 10 people.</span> <span id="s1603">So eight every -- one meter per person.</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">Q: One meter?</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">A: One meter.</span> <span id="s1606">So they -- they measured -- you know, that was, you know, it -- handled it perfectly, I mean, they adore us.</span> <span id="s1607">And we set up the ghetto pretty good, the doctors -- the doctors set up a sort of hospital inside to handle the sick people, and everything was working, organized.</span> <span id="s1608">So I don’t know if they liked that, probably didn’t like that organized kind of a -- a ghetto, pretty sure.</span> <span id="s1609">Anyhow, one day they came to ask for -- for 12 doctors.</span> <span id="s1610">The SS gave always orders what they want.</span> <span id="s1611">You know, one time they want gold, wanted silver, and -- and one day I was out of work and I was grabbed as a hostage -- as a hostage for a -- because they demand some amount of -- of money or something like that, it took a long time to get together, to get the -- collect the money from people.</span> <span id="s1612">So they took a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">Q: So you were a hot -- the Germans took you as a hostage?</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1615">Even though I been w -- I had the -- a -- even though I had a -- a I.D. to -- I worked in a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">A: -- a German place, it -- it di-didn’t ag -- they didn’t care about that, who -- everybody’s on their own, they have a different law, the SS has different laws.</span> <span id="s1618">So they again took us into a place where -- enc-enclosed place, about -- I don’t know, couple of hundred people, hostages, and they threatened they will kill us if they are not delivered.</span> <span id="s1619">And the whole day long we been with our hands up and the machi -- the machine guns all around, and watching these -- the few hu -- the people who were not the hostages.</span> <span id="s1620">And towards the evening, ar -- they took out nine people and they s -- and they did, they said they gonna shot them, execute them to show them that they mean business, the Judenrat, they should give -- they didn’t deliver enou -- along -- soon enough the -- the ransom.</span> <span id="s1621">So they killed 10 people -- nine people.</span> <span id="s1622">So -- so then the Judenrat tried to give -- de-deliver the -- deliver the ransom and we were freed in -- towards the evening.</span> <span id="s1623">That’s one thing.</span> <span id="s1624">So every day it was some other kind of -- sort of action again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">Q: What -- what -- what was happening to you?</span> <span id="s1626">Were you getting depressed, were you getting angry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">A: Depressed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">Q: Do you -- do you -- do you remember what it was feeling like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1629">A: I don’t remember, we just followed the others, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1630">Q: So you were just going to keep going.</span></p> <p><span id="s1631">A: Keep going.</span> <span id="s1632">Keep going as long as -- as we could physically.</span> <span id="s1633">Mentally, just kind of -- it was [indecipherable] thing, you know.</span> <span id="s1634">So you [indecipherable] of -- the ambiti -- you know, ambition of doing -- of getting out or something like that, and there’s no way out.</span> <span id="s1635">No way out.</span> <span id="s1636">And every day something else, they took people.</span> <span id="s1637">And I worked over there, I worked as a -- in the shop, so the best thing was at work, so they didn’t -- he couldn’t -- you know, at -- at work we weren’t bothered with the -- the SS didn’t bothered with SS, we, as workers we had a lot of people, everybody worked at his job was -- was a kind of relief --</span></p> <p><span id="s1638">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">A: -- because when we got back to the city, you locked up in the ghetto, you just like a -- oh, a closed -- closed world, you know, you -- you -- th-then it depressed when you come home, when you come to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1640">But s -- it -- it -- th-the [indecipherable] we were thinking of escape, but we had no arms, we had nowhere, nothing to escape.</span> <span id="s1641">You sort of need some arms.</span> <span id="s1642">Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">Q: So who -- who are you talking with?</span> <span id="s1644">Or is -- is there a -- is there a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1645">A: The ghetto people -- people in ghetto, maybe our -- my -- my friends and myself, we were talking about -- about escaping.</span> <span id="s1646">But there was tho -- we ha -- we really didn’t know the area, we didn’t know enough.</span> <span id="s1647">So we waited, we had prepared ourself to escape and something, but we did not move until we’ll get either some bigger group or something like that.</span> <span id="s1648">Meanwhile, pe -- we heard a lot of people being killed.</span> <span id="s1649">Besides that, every time there’s another incident, another reason.</span> <span id="s1650">We had this -- where we worked we had a one officer who was a supply officer, was this Smith and he was -- he’s lo -- a nice -- you know, nice guy, nice guy.</span> <span id="s1651">He was doing -- so the foreman was from Warsaw and he had -- he says he had made trip to -- to Poland.</span> <span id="s1652">So we ask him, just a joke, you know, can I go with you?</span> <span id="s1653">He says yes.</span> <span id="s1654">He took him to Warsaw to his family, he saw his family in -- in -- in Warsaw and he’s -- when he came back he says, oh, Warsaw is -- is [indecipherable] there’s no threat of being killed, you know, like here, we have every day.</span> <span id="s1655">So he was working hard to go back to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1656">He was always dreaming --</span></p> <p><span id="s1657">Q: To get to Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">A: -- to go to -- back to Warsaw because it’s so bad here, every day people being killed.</span> <span id="s1659">And anyhow, he -- he didn't succeeded, you know, cause it was -- waited too long, this Smith wa -- the Smith was gone and another -- he -- he contacted even -- made a deal with another guy, a German chauffeur who drove and he collected some friends from Warsaw, those who want to go to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1660">He -- he brought such a beautiful picture of Warsaw, the black market is so busy, what -- he saw the good things, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1661">I-It was a bad -- but the Warsaw ghetto wasn’t bet -- much better, but he saw the good.</span> <span id="s1662">Maybe his family was involved in business or something like that.</span> <span id="s1663">And so when he collected the all people, those who want to go in Warsaw, he collect too the money, and the -- the chauffeur, which is the guy I don’t know how ba -- how goo -- how well he knew him, when he took him in the morning -- in the morning he picked him up, he picked up all the passengers and he drove right to the SS.</span> <span id="s1664">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">Q: They killed him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1666">A: They killed him, sure, right away.</span> <span id="s1667">So, about the doctors, he took it -- they ask for 12 doctors, and if a doctor which I have been seeing, he told me he was a cu -- throat and -- and ear specialist.</span> <span id="s1668">And so I knew him because I’ve seen him a few times, and I met him some other time.</span> <span id="s1669">He came home running -- he came home with a satchel from a patient and his wife told him to -- th -- they were here looking for you because they need 12 doctors, and they need for some camp which -- I don’t know, it’s just the -- you know, excuse, I would ge -- to make them feel good, that they’re going to help sick people.</span> <span id="s1670">And he is -- was running to help sick people.</span> <span id="s1671">There’s some [indecipherable] sick people in the camp, which he -- they need 12 doctors.</span> <span id="s1672">And he missed the -- the -- this group, I mean, other words, they were looking for him and they went without.</span> <span id="s1673">But he came home and his wife told him, he didn’t leave his satchel, he went right away to the Judenrat to repe -- report that the -- they were [indecipherable] and there was an SS man or something who still -- he still got -- include him in a group, and they led him away and they killed him right at -- right in the s -- not -- you know, into the SS quarter -- headquarters.</span> <span id="s1674">So this was the daily -- daily things what happened, and we thought of escaping.</span> <span id="s1675">We -- some people tried to escape, I don’t know if they made it.</span> <span id="s1676">They also didn’t have any arms.</span> <span id="s1677">The time went by, we worked all winter, and then -- then they were really -- they were coming to us that sort of we heard about the massacres in other towns.</span> <span id="s1678">Was the people we worked with, sometimes some par -- some people -- some peasants came to work and they told us certain towns there were some massacres [indecipherable] out, you know, like next town [indecipherable] neighboring towns.</span> <span id="s1679">So we really thought of escapings, you know, but we waiting for -- for y -- we had no organized groups to escape.</span> <span id="s1680">So the -- they -- they was -- they came when the -- in the spring.</span> <span id="s1681">It was the -- I don’t remember the dates.</span> <span id="s1682">What I remember it was kind of Purim and people -- people are -- people were really celebrating, you know, as quietly, a Purim holiday [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1683">The -- the ghetto was sort of the we -- the people went out to work and I start to go to work with -- they took us to one like, place where they collected all the people, the working people, all the columns.</span> <span id="s1684">And a lot of people worked outside the ghetto, and they put all these people [indecipherable] waiting for this -- for what, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1685">We waited til the ha -- our president, our Judenrat president appeared and he says that the German authorities want some 200 people for different -- for different work in railroad something.</span> <span id="s1686">It was really lies, but to make it -- it -- it’s prepa -- a preparation for something else, but -- so they took 200 people, other words, let us go to work.</span> <span id="s1687">We were --those who had to go to work, had to go to work and took some people out of work, and at -- at work we found out that -- I don’t know, they took [indecipherable] I don’t know where to, no -- nobody knew where to, but they took them away.</span> <span id="s1688">They -- they -- yeah, they took out the s -- they went into the ghetto the same time and they took some children and elderly people the same day, in the morning before they went out, we assembled, we got -- we were out there -- out again, the SS called upon the -- our president, the Jewish president, the -- to his of -- to the office, and they demand three thou -- 4,000 people.</span> <span id="s1689">Our ghetto had 12,000.</span> <span id="s1690">Our ghetto --</span></p> <p><span id="s1691">Q: Had 12,000 Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">A: -- had 12,000 Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1693">Q: And they wanted 4,000.</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">A: And there -- they want f -- 4,000.</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">Q: We have to stop the tape, I’m sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1696">End of Tape Five</span></p> <p><span id="s1697">Beginning Tape Six</span></p> <p><span id="s1698">Q: You were talking about there were 10,000 Jews in the ghetto, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1699">A: 12.</span></p> <p><span id="s1700">Q: Or 12,000, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1701">A: 12,000.</span></p> <p><span id="s1702">Q: -- they were looking for 4,000.</span> <span id="s1703">So they were going to kill 4,000?</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">A: When they were ready -- the SS, I’m talking --</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1706">A: -- was demanding, they called up Mr. Isikson, he was the ch -- the head of -- the president of the Judenrat, while we in the -- in that area together out of the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1707">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">A: And they want the amount of people -- some amount of people, they called Isikson and demand he should deliver the kids, the elderly, and to make up 4,000 -- they wanted 4,000 people.</span> <span id="s1709">They want 4,000 people.</span> <span id="s1710">And Isikson was [indecipherable] and he -- he says, you ask me for gold, money, I give you.</span> <span id="s1711">But ma -- people and their kids, you have to come and get yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">Q: Because he knew what they were gonna do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1713">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1714">So at that time they figured they have to do it, you know, and they gonna do it by themselves.</span> <span id="s1715">So the ghetto was already [indecipherable] the SS, and things like that.</span> <span id="s1716">They took out people -- we were at the -- assembled outside in the place on the -- outside the ghetto, the working people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1717">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1718">A: So our -- our -- our chef -- the head, took out his pe -- a lot of people, German and officers who had the people working for them came and took their people out of work.</span> <span id="s1719">So those who worked for the German [indecipherable] organizations, German [indecipherable] could go to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">Q: So they were protected in some way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1721">A: They were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1722">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">A: So we go to work, we didn’t know if -- what is going to happen now.</span> <span id="s1724">They -- they were protected, so there’s -- they wanted to keep the workers still working, while they take -- and they want to take the kids and the elderly, a-and to get 4,000 in the first place, for them.</span> <span id="s1725">So is -- Isikson refused, s-so they let them go home, and we, sort of after we heard what’s going on, we stayed in the place, we didn't go ho -- go to work -- go to -- home after work --</span></p> <p><span id="s1726">Q: You stayed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1727">A: -- the same day.</span> <span id="s1728">We didn’t go home.</span> <span id="s1729">And we did hide in our -- and rarely you find a place to hide, until we’ll -- the things what we heard what’s going on [indecipherable] in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1730">So -- and towards the evening, we sort of were told to go to get ready to go home, to go to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1731">So we were about 73 people, those who remained hiding inside, they didn’t want -- want to go [indecipherable] and we didn’t go before, but now they want to wait, they said they -- they have to go to the ghetto, you had to go home.</span> <span id="s1732">And here we still heard the news from -- and we heard the guns -- machine guns, that they’re still killing people.</span> <span id="s1733">So there was question, you know, was like going to a ghetto, you going right into -- to the open -- to this slaughter.</span> <span id="s1734">So the people were afraid to go, but they had to -- they had to sort of make sure to -- to stay.</span> <span id="s1735">If they could stay, they would say if they could stay here in the -- in the place of work another night, would be good.</span> <span id="s1736">So one lady came into my tailoring room with a gold watch and she put the watch down and said -- she told me, go in and talk to the -- our head.</span> <span id="s1737">Rudel is the head of the -- our officers, if -- to bribe him, he should let us stay one night more.</span> <span id="s1738">If they a -- the slaughter will go by.</span> <span id="s1739">So I said -- looked at her, I said, you -- you know, you crazy, because I -- this man never came into me, I [indecipherable] he doesn’t know me, cause the others -- officers work -- came in for work, he never came in to work -- for work.</span> <span id="s1740">And so is -- but til -- she left the watch, she walked out, you do it.</span> <span id="s1741">I says, that’s the only way out -- she said, whether I could -- could do it, and think to do it.</span> <span id="s1742">And I was sitting in [indecipherable] says, she is crazy.</span> <span id="s1743">I mean, he never -- he never came -- he never know me -- he never came to me, and I can-cannot go bribing somebody like that, you know, it’s -- it’s ridiculous.</span> <span id="s1744">Well, waiting, waiting, waiting, and there’s no other solution, so the pe -- so people says, well, what can you -- what would you do?</span> <span id="s1745">What can you do?</span> <span id="s1746">Well, I said, I’ll -- have no choice and I have to go, whatever is -- if -- if I wouldn’t do that, you say, oh, if you would have gone, you have -- do -- did something, it -- it would have -- it would have been something.</span> <span id="s1747">Now, we are really without any he -- without any help.</span> <span id="s1748">So I took this watch and I walked over, this is one barrack where the officers lived, and I have that [indecipherable] everything over there in one bag.</span> <span id="s1749">I walked over and I -- I la -- never was in this office, never went -- I knew more or less where the doors -- it’s right the first door.</span> <span id="s1750">So I knocked the door, and he says, enter [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1751">So I walked in and I s -- was -- had to stand on the rear door, I didn’t move.</span> <span id="s1752">I just walked in, I didn’t move, because his -- this room, the decorations around give you a sc -- give you such a scare, all this Hackenkreuz is -- banners hanging and the [indecipherable], the Hitler and Goerings and everything all around.</span> <span id="s1753">Is -- is just like Goering or something, or some other officer in his office in -- in a -- in the back of the room, and in a -- in a de -- on the desk.</span> <span id="s1754">And I says -- so -- so he says, well, well, was -- what do I want -- what do you want?</span> <span id="s1755">Say, I want to talk to you.</span> <span id="s1756">So he -- he sits in a [indecipherable] so come here.</span> <span id="s1757">I walk over and I didn’t ask anything, I took out the watch and put on the table.</span> <span id="s1758">He says -- I says, look, this is what we have, what one of the ladies have and she doesn’t need it, because if we go home the ghetto we gonna be killed anyhow, you might use it, s -- give it -- send it to you.</span> <span id="s1759">One of your family, I don’t know whether he was married or not, never knew.</span> <span id="s1760">He says to me in a quiet way, he says take it back, I don’t want it, I don’t need it.</span> <span id="s1761">[indecipherable] and I le -- I look at him and I was -- I don’t see the same person.</span> <span id="s1762">He -- he asks me to sit down, and you know what -- what happen.</span> <span id="s1763">And I sit down, I says, take the watch.</span> <span id="s1764">Forget it, he says, take it back, and nothing going to happen to you.</span> <span id="s1765">It’s over.</span> <span id="s1766">In other words, this load is over.</span> <span id="s1767">And nothing is going to happen to you, nothing is going to happen.</span> <span id="s1768">I said, well I still hear the guns.</span> <span id="s1769">He says, I -- I have or -- I have information, he says.</span> <span id="s1770">So I walk out and -- with this news, and I told the guys waiting for me, and I told them that we could go home and nothing is going to happen, it’s over.</span> <span id="s1771">Meanwhile, we still heard the guns, we still heard the machine guns go.</span> <span id="s1772">And time goes shorter and we -- we have to go soon, at six o’clock we going home.</span> <span id="s1773">So they said to me, look, we going to go a column with people, with 70 people.</span> <span id="s1774">They don’t know who we are or what ev -- what kind of [indecipherable] we have.</span> <span id="s1775">See -- do something, tal-talk to him, see if maybe he’ll send somebody to explain to the guards, you know.</span> <span id="s1776">Well, I said, maybe they’re right, but since I saw that he is -- didn’t -- he -- he not, you know, the same guy is over there.</span> <span id="s1777">So I went over and I -- again, I says that the people are afraid to go because they don’t know where they will -- if they know what we are, who we are or something like that.</span> <span id="s1778">And I said, if you would have [indecipherable] I mean, I thought -- as I thought -- if you would go with us to lu -- I mean, to the gate and te -- explain who we are.</span> <span id="s1779">So he was thinking a few minutes.</span> <span id="s1780">Okay, I’ll go.</span> <span id="s1781">So he got into his car and he drove ahead and we marched with 12 guards, of Air Force guards to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1782">And it was not complete over, but it was over.</span> <span id="s1783">At that moment, when we came to the gates, we saw Mr. Isikson was led out by SS.</span> <span id="s1784">Two guys took him and his assistant to their car and put them away -- took him away, for good.</span> <span id="s1785">So that’s why, he did -- he didn’t obey the orders.</span> <span id="s1786">He didn’t give them the 4,000 people.</span> <span id="s1787">He made [indecipherable] -- so that’s what it is.</span> <span id="s1788">I mean, they -- they ne -- appointed another guy for Judenrat, for -- they appointed another guy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1789">Q: You -- you said that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1790">A: I been -- we been waiting in -- in front of the ghet -- gate, to be -- to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1791">Q: To go back in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1792">A: -- to go back in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1793">Q: And saw --</span></p> <p><span id="s1794">A: But they weren't that finished, they didn’t clean up -- they didn’t -- til they put a -- bore out the juden -- the -- Mr. Isikson, and then they opened the gates and -- to get -- to let in us, our people.</span> <span id="s1795">My pe -- my group of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1796">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1797">How did you know what Isikson had said, that he refused?</span> <span id="s1798">Is that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1799">A: When I came in the ghetto --</span></p> <p><span id="s1800">Q: People told you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1801">A: -- the guy who was the Judenrat man, told us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1802">Q: That that’s why he was taken.</span></p> <p><span id="s1803">A: [indecipherable] a part of the Judenrat, not the -- nobody was a -- but he pol -- told us -- he told us he was -- around the ghetto he was a member of the Judenrat and he was supposed to be -- to accompany the SS when they lo -- loaded the people on trucks, out to the -- to the shooting place.</span> <span id="s1804">But before, when I left him since -- first time, when I went out his door, another officer which used to come into me with a lot of work [indecipherable] well, no f -- more kind of -- he obviously used to talk, have a d -- you know, he -- he used to come in more often, and he [indecipherable] with me.</span> <span id="s1805">And he says -- he told me where I work -- where I been working, you know, like a front yard [indecipherable] 150 yards, and he start -- he’s talking to me in working, that this morning, he says, they took us, all the officers, not only us, but officers in the whole town who have workers -- officer who work here, and the -- for the germ -- German officers, they took him -- they took them to show the slaughter [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1806">They -- they -- the way they -- what they -- what they do, they want to show off how they kill the people, and he says -- Mr. Lindow, Mr. Lindow says unthinkable, unbelievable, he says.</span> <span id="s1807">What they did, it’s unbelievable, unthinkable.</span> <span id="s1808">How’d they do it?</span> <span id="s1809">He probably didn’t want to go too long with -- walk along outside with me, but this few steps he did it, he told me what happened.</span> <span id="s1810">In other words they all -- and he -- and he [indecipherable] was along with them.</span> <span id="s1811">And that probably gave him a shock, and he changed.</span> <span id="s1812">He changed to a degree that was such the completely different.</span> <span id="s1813">He was really -- he was really -- he didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s1814">He was -- you know, I couldn’t recognize him.</span> <span id="s1815">You know, he walked around, he didn’t say a word, he didn’t say to u -- to u -- to the others.</span> <span id="s1816">S-So that was -- his story was -- didn’t end yet because soon after, we -- groups -- we had a resistance group in the ghetto, and we escaped.</span> <span id="s1817">And with some arms left, we had a nice bunker.</span> <span id="s1818">I build a bunker which is we had some arms, the resistance had some arms, and we sort of prepared for resistance.</span> <span id="s1819">And since they took us out from the ghetto [indecipherable] resistance wasn’t working.</span></p> <p><span id="s1820">Q: Couldn't happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1821">A: It couldn’t happen.</span> <span id="s1822">But when we came back, some of my arms, my bunker wasn’t dis -- wasn’t discovered.</span> <span id="s1823">I mean, they found a lot of bunkers and they dis -- confiscated a lot of arms, which we prepared for the resistance.</span></p> <p><span id="s1824">Q: Where did you get arms?</span> <span id="s1825">Where did you get weapons from?</span></p> <p><span id="s1826">A: Well, we had y -- you know, y -- our people worked to collect the arms from the Russian military.</span> <span id="s1827">When they gave up, they left in the woods and the fields, so they had to collect these, so the people from the ghetto worked this -- with this comp -- with this group to bring the arms, so they smuggled in these arms, from rifles to grenades, you know, as much as they could.</span> <span id="s1828">So I had the -- my -- my -- my friend Tanchim was -- was the head from my group, we had five in a group prepared.</span> <span id="s1829">And our -- we -- since we had a rifle and grenades in our -- in our bunker, and our bunker was not found.</span> <span id="s1830">So, in other words, we planned an escape and it’s the only arms we had, the others were confiscated.</span> <span id="s1831">And we prepared an escape.</span> <span id="s1832">We didn’t know which way, whether through the ghetto, cut the g -- cut the barbed wires, or from the place we work, from the airfield -- airfield.</span> <span id="s1833">It took us time to get this -- smuggle the arm -- we decided to escape from the airport, and so our people were the electricians.</span> <span id="s1834">Our people who were from our resistance group, they worked -- they were electricians and they worked out in the airfield, further out, and over there at the airfield we walked around free.</span> <span id="s1835">We didn’t -- even though we had patches and things like that, nobody bothered us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1836">Q: But they were -- the electricians were farther away than you were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1837">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s1838">Q: The -- the electricians were farther away than you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s1839">A: No, no, they were --</span></p> <p><span id="s1840">Q: They were in the same f -- airfield?</span></p> <p><span id="s1841">A: The same airfield, but they were in -- into the airfield that they are almost like further out in the [indecipherable] they worked th -- the electrician --</span></p> <p><span id="s1842">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1843">A: -- [indecipherable] installations, so they worked out further, so we -- they explained that there’s some bushes we could stay there all day long, go to work and from work, the little -- this -- you know, single people could go there to the point where we ha -- go together and in the evening, we’ll escape with the whole group.</span></p> <p><span id="s1844">Q: Now can -- can I ask you something?</span></p> <p><span id="s1845">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1846">Q: Were -- were there -- a number of resistance groups in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1847">A: There were what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1848">Q: Were there a number of resistance groups in the ghetto, not just yours, there were other ones?</span></p> <p><span id="s1849">A: There were the other two, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1850">Q: There were two more?</span></p> <p><span id="s1851">A: Two</span></p> <p><span id="s1852">Q: Two more?</span></p> <p><span id="s1853">A: There were, in general, two resistance groups, separate, you know, but they -- different plans, we had different plans.</span> <span id="s1854">But at this point the ghetto was already divided again, smaller and [indecipherable] and there -- and there was a lot of people --</span></p> <p><span id="s1855">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1856">A: You know [indecipherable] cause the resistance lost a lot of people, even those -- our own people.</span> <span id="s1857">So the other escape was planned for my group, plans with our arms [indecipherable] in our basement [indecipherable] but still it was on the other side, the ghetto was cut off shorter.</span> <span id="s1858">You know, they -- there were less people, they cut -- they cut the ghetto shorter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1859">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1860">A: So even though there were -- our arms were in the other side, behind barbed wire, but we managed to go through [indecipherable] guys -- the guys went over at night [indecipherable] get into -- brought into the new ghetto, our arms --</span></p> <p><span id="s1861">Q: So they went over the fence?</span></p> <p><span id="s1862">A: Cut the wires.</span></p> <p><span id="s1863">Q: They cut the wires?</span></p> <p><span id="s1864">A: Cut the wires, and we watched the guards.</span> <span id="s1865">The guards were going back and forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1866">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1867">A: And we want to get these arm back to the place where worked at the airport -- at the airfield.</span> <span id="s1868">From there we planned to escape.</span> <span id="s1869">As we --</span></p> <p><span id="s1870">Q: Can I ask you something?</span></p> <p><span id="s1871">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1872">Q: This sounds different from --</span></p> <p><span id="s1873">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s1874">Q: This -- this kind of behavior, for you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1875">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1876">Q: -- being in the resistance, seems different than what you did before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1877">A: Different?</span></p> <p><span id="s1878">Q: So what -- what made you join the resistance?</span></p> <p><span id="s1879">A: What made join the resistance is simply because you cannot go to the slaughter like sheeps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1880">Q: So you wanted to do something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1881">A: Wanted [inaudible], and of course there was no, assurance, you know.</span> <span id="s1882">Sure, it’s a lost battle, but you want to have a resistance, as much as we could do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1883">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1884">A: As much as we could do.</span> <span id="s1885">And we [indecipherable] arms, their arms are better, but we knew it’s not the same -- it’s not the same as -- it’s not a even struggle.</span> <span id="s1886">But we got to do something.</span> <span id="s1887">But later on, when it turned out that we were left with a few arms only, and the -- and most of the resistant people were killed in -- in the ghetto, so [indecipherable] there were left, we were 24 people together, we made the escape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1888">Q: And when was the escape, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1889">A: When the escape?</span></p> <p><span id="s1890">Q: About.</span></p> <p><span id="s1891">A: About, it was October, something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1892">Q: Was it cold, snowy, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1893">A: Oh, cold, really [indecipherable] was sep -- August, it is the end of September, octo -- something like that.</span> <span id="s1894">Preparation, you know, it was kind of -- til we moved back the arms to the -- you know, we got -- you have to esca -- the escape has to be -- if you’re not armed you cannot escape.</span> <span id="s1895">I mean, you can escape --</span></p> <p><span id="s1896">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1897">A: -- but to make sure, it’s better -- it’s assurance, if you have something, it feels -- you feel stronger.</span> <span id="s1898">I know it --</span></p> <p><span id="s1899">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1900">A: -- I know when [indecipherable] and we had the hand grenades for the rest of the people, so we hand out just the one hand grenade, makes you so strong that you feel -- you walk differently, you have, you know, a little more courage, you -- so you -- at least you have some ar -- some -- some resistance.</span> <span id="s1901">And we [indecipherable] we made it, we made the escape.</span> <span id="s1902">Later on we sh -- we got out the arms outside to the airfield over there and we -- the arms were hidden in the bushes and then we made the escape.</span> <span id="s1903">We made the group together, little by little --</span></p> <p><span id="s1904">Q: This is 24 pe --</span></p> <p><span id="s1905">A: -- single -- single people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1906">Q: -- uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1907">A: Single few people just [indecipherable] not going one group, but just we knew that we’re in the group together, little by little and we -- we grouped together at [indecipherable] you know, it’s [indecipherable] now.</span> <span id="s1908">You know it’s a little -- in September -- is it -- was it October, or that’s -- or something like that, something like -- it was -- the summer was over.</span> <span id="s1909">And -- and days are -- and people -- what the guys who worked there, and they came later, told us what -- when we were escaped and then the foreman is counting us, that -- and he reported to -- to the Rudel that 24 people missing.</span> <span id="s1910">He says they escaped.</span> <span id="s1911">So -- so he -- s -- that’s what they told us, that Rudel said, in -- in German, yeah, when they’ll -- Wenn sie rieten Kennen losen die Laufen.</span> <span id="s1912">That’s the -- when -- when they can save themselves, let them -- let them run.</span> <span id="s1913">So he was the -- he became a different man and he chose later, if you want to finish his story, his story didn’t end yet, cause when we entered -- when we came to the parti -- partisan -- we met partisans, Russian partisans, they sort of were very anti-Semitic, but they [indecipherable] you -- you have to -- you have no arms, you know, you’re not armed.</span> <span id="s1914">We had our -- the rifles were -- he said, is not -- not enough.</span> <span id="s1915">You cannot fight, he says, with this, you gotta get arms.</span> <span id="s1916">So you gotta send out here -- do something, you know, he was really pushing us to -- to some point that you couldn't say no, was -- so he says, you gotta send out people to get arms, or to do some sabotage work.</span> <span id="s1917">You couldn’t do it if the fe -- you’re not armed you can’t anything, but anyhow, we -- the -- our leaders did send out --</span></p> <p><span id="s1918">Q: Can -- can you hold that thought, because we have to make a change of the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1919">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1920">Q: So the arms, we’ll start there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1921">End of Tape Six</span></p> <p><span id="s1922">Beginning Tape Seven</span></p> <p><span id="s1923">Q: Henry, let me ask you something.</span> <span id="s1924">This group that you are talking about, where they’re saying to you you have to go and get arms in order to be able to be in this group, cause you -- you didn't come out with enough -- is that the first group you were with?</span></p> <p><span id="s1925">A: That was the first group.</span> <span id="s1926">There was another --</span></p> <p><span id="s1927">Q: Wi -- how did you know where to go?</span> <span id="s1928">You leave the ghetto --</span></p> <p><span id="s1929">A: That’s -- that -- it’s interesting, you know, and it’s true, you know, you’re a -- good question, because we didn’t know, we weren't -- we never -- we didn’t grow up over there, we were mostly more from -- most of the group probably people from -- from Poland --</span></p> <p><span id="s1930">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1931">A: -- on the other side, but some people promise they know the law, they know the area, but it didn’t work -- it didn’t -- I don’t know if they told the truth.</span> <span id="s1932">They just probably want to go to ca -- take part in the escape and they promised they know.</span> <span id="s1933">Is -- you know, that happened a lot of things which are not expected, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1934">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1935">A: But we have inside pe -- we had now a group people, intelligent and people that -- we had sa -- little map -- they had some o -- little map, they -- they could [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1936">Well, this guy Muszinski, he was a Polish -- from Poland, also, from Czestochowa, and he -- he was electrician, good elect -- and he was also very intelligent.</span> <span id="s1937">He sort of l -- looked at the map, little map and he could -- could see how to get out, and he was y -- a little work here, he could see the -- there was a railroad, small rail tracks like they been carrying woods from the woods -- from the woods, all wood from the woods [indecipherable] get to this tracks, will be on the right track, in other, will go through -- the track goes through the woods.</span> <span id="s1938">He figured out this here.</span> <span id="s1939">So that was the -- that was the real intelligent judgment in the -- in this case.</span></p> <p><span id="s1940">Q: But how do you then find a resistance group, the partisans outside?</span></p> <p><span id="s1941">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s1942">Q: Was it an accident that you came upon it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1943">A: Accidentally.</span></p> <p><span id="s1944">Q: Accid --</span></p> <p><span id="s1945">A: Knew -- we knew where -- we knew as we -- we -- we grew closer, we -- as we came closer to the, you know, wooded areas, peasants gi -- you know, the peasants yi -- more or less gave us directions wi -- where the -- which other side -- see, the other side the river.</span> <span id="s1946">See, if you go the other side the river, you find them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1947">Q: You’ll find them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1948">A: And it’s true.</span> <span id="s1949">It was -- it was the river Sharra, and if you go the other side the river, we found them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1950">Q: Now what are you wearing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1951">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s1952">Q: What are you wearing?</span> <span id="s1953">It’s cold by then, right?</span> <span id="s1954">It’s almost winter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1955">A: [indecipherable] got -- I remember what -- what I have.</span> <span id="s1956">We didn't have very warm clothes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1957">Q: You didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s1958">A: I don’t remember sh -- well, I don’t remember extremely what -- if we have a [indecipherable] it was a problem, you know, at the moment you didn’t think about it.</span> <span id="s1959">You know --</span></p> <p><span id="s1960">Q: Was it cold?</span></p> <p><span id="s1961">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s1962">Q: Was it cold?</span></p> <p><span id="s1963">A: It wasn’t cold yet, no, it wasn’t cold yet.</span> <span id="s1964">It was very chi-chilly sometimes at night, but it wasn’t cold yet.</span> <span id="s1965">It wasn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s1966">Q: And everybody who leaves are men, young boys --</span></p> <p><span id="s1967">A: Is what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1968">Q: Men.</span></p> <p><span id="s1969">A: Men and wom -- and a few women, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1970">Q: Men -- there are a few women who --</span></p> <p><span id="s1971">A: Yeah, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1972">[indecipherable] wives from -- from here and there -- and -- and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1973">Q: No children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1974">A: No, no children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1975">Q: But about 24 people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1976">A: 24 people in this group.</span> <span id="s1977">And we had only with two rifles.</span> <span id="s1978">You know, one ri -- was in my bunker, and the other one was someone else’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s1979">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1980">A: A Russian girls.</span> <span id="s1981">And, you know, some hand grenades, because the girls brought hand grenades.</span> <span id="s1982">Where they worked, they smuggled hand grenades easier than --</span></p> <p><span id="s1983">Q: I see, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1984">A: -- yeah, for the girls to smuggle ah -- into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1985">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1986">Q: So you find it --</span></p> <p><span id="s1987">A: -- it was something like we have something to do, you know, we had some resistance with a -- whatever we could.</span> <span id="s1988">It not militarily succeed -- a success, we cannot be stronger than they are, they are -- they are very -- their arms are -- the -- our arms are no match for their arms.</span> <span id="s1989">But at least to -- to be resistant, to -- to fight back, no matter what -- how much you can do was not important, you just can fight back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1990">Q: That was what was important.</span></p> <p><span id="s1991">A: That was important.</span></p> <p><span id="s1992">Q: So you folks, the 24 of you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1993">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1994">Q: -- get to this first group.</span> <span id="s1995">So who is this group, do you even know who they are?</span> <span id="s1996">These are Russians?</span></p> <p><span id="s1997">A: People --</span></p> <p><span id="s1998">Q: These are ru -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1999">A: -- oh, to the ma -- oh that’s another thing, we don’t know the other -- we don’t know the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2000">Q: You don’t know them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2001">A: No --</span></p> <p><span id="s2002">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2003">A: -- we didn’t know, you know, we had no contact with them.</span> <span id="s2004">We had no connection, we had no connection and we had no contact before we left.</span> <span id="s2005">We figured, well we’ll -- we’ll -- we’ll find someone --</span></p> <p><span id="s2006">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2007">A: -- with a -- well, that -- when we found them, they were not good to us, they’re not friendly, they were anti-Semitic.</span></p> <p><span id="s2008">Q: They were anti-Semitic?</span></p> <p><span id="s2009">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2010">Q: And they knew you were Jewish, of course?</span></p> <p><span id="s2011">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s2012">Q: They knew you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s2013">A: Oh sure, they knew we came together.</span> <span id="s2014">There was one Ukraine guy who was -- he was sort of the head of -- not the head, but he was the s -- spoke to us in a manner like, in other words, why did you come here?</span> <span id="s2015">You gave the gold to -- to the Germans.</span> <span id="s2016">In other -- you gave the -- you gave th -- you gave the gold to the Germans, and you came here, in other words, empty handed.</span> <span id="s2017">You came here --</span></p> <p><span id="s2018">Q: Empty ha --</span></p> <p><span id="s2019">A: -- you came here what, to save your life, he said.</span> <span id="s2020">Well -- and -- but, he says, well you have to show that you really want to fight the -- back.</span> <span id="s2021">Fight the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2022">You have no arms, so you have to go and get arms, and you get whatever you can sabotage, whatever you can do.</span> <span id="s2023">So ma -- well, our guys went to start to do something, to think about something.</span> <span id="s2024">So we send out four different -- four different groups to show -- to go, as they say -- as they have demanded, they have demanded to go out to get arms, or to do sabotage.</span> <span id="s2025">So one guy from our group -- from -- who worked at the electricians, he said he’ll go back to the transformers, he’ll destroy the transformers in the airport.</span> <span id="s2026">It’s a big sabotage [indecipherable] and all the -- to -- young kids, they said they worked with -- for a ye -- they worked for police, they worked, you know, from the ghetto they went out to work to the police, railroad police, those who carried the prisoners and thing, or my people are [indecipherable] to the camps, or those prison -- those have a police force, they have a police force and they worked for them.</span> <span id="s2027">So they -- so they go and see if they could get some arms over there.</span> <span id="s2028">And the third one -- the third group is just to get int -- the information to go near the railroad, to see the -- bring the information, the movement, what kind of -- what kind of movement it is, what cargo, military or some that.</span> <span id="s2029">So there were fo -- and then there’s another group which just simply -- I don’t know whether you figure to go get some arms.</span> <span id="s2030">And those four -- four guys, you know, they went out, they didn’t have arms with them.</span> <span id="s2031">They weren't armed, but they went to look for arms, which was really --</span></p> <p><span id="s2032">Q: So these are guys going alone?</span></p> <p><span id="s2033">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s2034">Q: These are guys going alone or in their small groups?</span></p> <p><span id="s2035">A: In their s -- no, alone, they --</span></p> <p><span id="s2036">Q: They’re alone?</span></p> <p><span id="s2037">A: -- some of them are alone, some of them with small group.</span></p> <p><span id="s2038">Q: [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2039">And are you going at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s2040">A: No, I --</span></p> <p><span id="s2041">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2042">A: -- not go --</span></p> <p><span id="s2043">Q: You’re staying.</span></p> <p><span id="s2044">A: -- they were going.</span> <span id="s2045">I [indecipherable] I didn’t go there.</span> <span id="s2046">But I was [indecipherable] you know, to the other one.</span></p> <p><span id="s2047">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2048">A: So the others has way -- they have -- they have some sort of place where they could find it, maybe they had in the mind somewheres to go where they could find some arms.</span> <span id="s2049">And those fo-four guys, those four guys were killed right away, out -- when they stepped -- you know, the first -- the first -- they -- the German patrol right away killed them as soon they went out on the other side, the outside of the camps, you know, they -- you know, an hour later, something like that.</span> <span id="s2050">These four gu -- and the other guy, they went wi -- to -- went to blow up the transformers, they went -- came -- went back to the pu -- in other words, the place where we were and he was spotted -- he was mix -- miggling -- mixing with jig -- the guy still which working there, he was play like one of them, and then stay overnight and do his job.</span> <span id="s2051">While he was hanging around there, a Polish guy knew his -- that he escaped in the partisans [indecipherable] worked with the Jewish guys and they were talking about he -- that Moishe Polak is -- is in the partisans.</span> <span id="s2052">And then he sees him here.</span> <span id="s2053">He sur -- he informed the SS.</span> <span id="s2054">And they -- they came and picked him up and brought him for interrogation and one SS officer was sitting next [indecipherable] his table, and nic -- is sort of asking questions.</span> <span id="s2055">And he had a hand grenade with for -- from our group, the guy, he pulled out the hand grenade.</span> <span id="s2056">So the officer saw the hand grenade, he went out the room.</span> <span id="s2057">And he wants to blow himself up --</span></p> <p><span id="s2058">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2059">A: -- with the hand grenade, but the hand grenade didn’t go off.</span> <span id="s2060">So he opened the window, and just -- he jumped out and killed himself jumping out the window.</span></p> <p><span id="s2061">Q: Mm.</span> <span id="s2062">So right away it’s a tragedy, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2063">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2064">Boys cry [indecipherable] cry.</span> <span id="s2065">All the others have also su -- they all succeeded, but the four guys who were killed the first were people who worked in our place.</span></p> <p><span id="s2066">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2067">A: And they, when they were killed, they had their documents on them, the -- the -- their I.D.’s.</span> <span id="s2068">So they knew where they worked.</span> <span id="s2069">So went back and they had this, the SS went back to the work -- to the place where they worked, and tried to find -- to find out how come they don’t know -- they didn’t know that they escaped.</span> <span id="s2070">Said, when did they escape?</span> <span id="s2071">So the -- they -- they went to the far [indecipherable] it’s an office where they keep their registers and the files from all the workers.</span> <span id="s2072">And they were looking for the files for these guys, and they couldn’t find them.</span> <span id="s2073">So they ask these clerks, is there missing files?</span> <span id="s2074">Well, he -- he said that Rudel, man was here, he took out the files, say you don’t know, you know, for what reason they too -- took out.</span> <span id="s2075">He took out and destroyed them, like we never existed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2076">Q: Existed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2077">A: So that was -- he didn’t call -- when we escaped he didn’t alarm the SS, that’s one thing.</span> <span id="s2078">He didn’t go to chase us [indecipherable] us -- he was it -- and so, in other words, and then he figured that he’ll take out the -- the files, nobody will look in -- will -- nobody will know that we escaped.</span> <span id="s2079">So meanwhile the SS arrested Rudel and as they -- later on the guys came, they came after us, some of them managed to escape, the last -- the last -- the last -- from our -- from [indecipherable] we were -- told us about that, how he was arrested and court-martialed.</span> <span id="s2080">So I felt I -- I felt that he [indecipherable] was talking to him that he -- he went through a tremendous change, being that he was a devoted Nazi and could not -- he would not expect that kind of scene which is -- you know, it could break down a lot of people, but he broke down even though he’s a -- he was a devoted Nazi.</span></p> <p><span id="s2081">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2082">A: It broke him down.</span> <span id="s2083">And you know ho mak -- how much -- how strong they are what it is and you know, but you never know is a [indecipherable] a man is just a human being [indecipherable] could break down anybody.</span> <span id="s2084">So that’s what the ir -- we heard of these guys who came later, what he -- what happened to him, and he -- and he was court-martialed and presumably -- I don’t know what -- which way, or -- it’s hard to find them.</span> <span id="s2085">I then -- go to find --</span></p> <p><span id="s2086">Q: How do you spell his name, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2087">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s2088">Q: How do you spell his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s2089">A: I don’t exactly know, but I l --</span></p> <p><span id="s2090">Q: Is it R-u-d-e-l?</span> <span id="s2091">Or --</span></p> <p><span id="s2092">A: R-u -- R-u-d -- R-u-d-e-l</span></p> <p><span id="s2093">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2094">A: And the -- this -- we had still a struggle and -- and the others over the -- cause this group was very anti-Semitic, with -- the ones that were -- gave us orders to go.</span> <span id="s2095">We had such a -- really, we lost so many people right away, the first fr -- right in the first step, lost two -- two of the good people.</span> <span id="s2096">Two of this and the three [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2097">And -- and the main thing is what -- is where they were not instructed how t-to do it, how to go.</span> <span id="s2098">They were strange, you know, and they -- out from the woods, they know -- they didn’t know if you can go by a daytime or at night.</span> <span id="s2099">You know, some of them go dangerous places, you don’t go in broad daylight, you -- you wait until -- til it’s getting dark, or complete night.</span> <span id="s2100">They were not giving instructions at all, they just send them out to be killed or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2101">Q: So what happened in that group?</span> <span id="s2102">Did you stay there, or did you folks leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s2103">A: Fa -- we didn’t stay long with them, because they were really very -- like whole group were really -- like how could I say, they -- they told us -- they ma -- called them ex-convicts.</span> <span id="s2104">I mean, you know, like --</span></p> <p><span id="s2105">Q: Ex-convicts?</span> <span id="s2106">Did they seem like criminal --</span></p> <p><span id="s2107">A: Yeah [indecipherable] Russian -- them Russian -- the Russians, they open the jails you know, the [indecipherable] they were vicious guys, killers.</span> <span id="s2108">They could kill [indecipherable] even, very easy, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2109">Q: How did they treat the women who were in the group?</span></p> <p><span id="s2110">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s2111">Q: How did they treat the women?</span></p> <p><span id="s2112">A: How they treat the women?</span></p> <p><span id="s2113">Q: The women -- you are -- the women who came with your group.</span></p> <p><span id="s2114">A: No, they didn’t bother our women, but they had their own.</span></p> <p><span id="s2115">Q: They had their own women.</span></p> <p><span id="s2116">A: Yeah, they had their own women.</span> <span id="s2117">Every [indecipherable] is a different -- different way of -- but, they were horrible.</span> <span id="s2118">They were horrible and their behavior wasn’t good, and their treatment.</span> <span id="s2119">They really let [indecipherable] we could not stay there longer, but was -- they were robbing us, and they robbed our arms, and the shoes, some good shoes they took off.</span> <span id="s2120">People came from the ghetto still when the ghetto was there and they had something, some valuables, s-something, they robbed them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2121">Q: They took it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2122">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2123">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2124">A: Yeah, they weren’t afraid.</span> <span id="s2125">They always took shoes off, they [indecipherable] watches [indecipherable] the handgun and som -- so they took away.</span> <span id="s2126">You see, the handgun is only for officers.</span> <span id="s2127">You don’t have to --</span></p> <p><span id="s2128">Q: Handguns are only for officers?</span></p> <p><span id="s2129">A: Yeah, yeah, only for officers.</span> <span id="s2130">That’s the excuse.</span></p> <p><span id="s2131">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2132">A: [indecipherable] explain, why did you -- why did you take -- you know.</span> <span id="s2133">Oh that -- that -- this -- a handgun is only for officers here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2134">Q: So tell me, did your group have a leader of some kind?</span></p> <p><span id="s2135">A: Yeah, the -- we have a leader what -- he couldn’t do much.</span> <span id="s2136">[indecipherable] have a leaders, you have two leaders, you have a co -- a few guys which are sort of in the leadership sure.</span> <span id="s2137">Well, they were still in the -- in the ghetto, there were leaders, so they -- some of them were still leaders in the group.</span></p> <p><span id="s2138">Q: So who made the decision to leave?</span> <span id="s2139">All of you together, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s2140">A: To leave to go out?</span></p> <p><span id="s2141">Q: To go -- no, to go to another group, you [indecipherable] this first --</span></p> <p><span id="s2142">A: Oh, to go another group later on?</span></p> <p><span id="s2143">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2144">A: Well, course it was impossible to stay there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2145">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2146">A: So you had to find a -- we found out that there -- another group is coming to this area, and -- and it’s -- it is an entire different area.</span> <span id="s2147">They came from -- from a Slonim are -- area that’s -- it’s another region where the pe -- the German had big, big raids there.</span> <span id="s2148">A division with mi -- the army diverted to clean -- to -- to clean out their -- their trads -- their groups.</span> <span id="s2149">They were a big unit, you know, a big movement --</span></p> <p><span id="s2150">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2151">A: -- of different groups, lot of groups.</span> <span id="s2152">So they moved towards us, they were going to go further e -- further east.</span> <span id="s2153">So some of the groups also split up.</span> <span id="s2154">There was a -- a Jewish group, what with a Russian com -- commander, so we figured well maybe it’s a good -- so we got the idea to go.</span> <span id="s2155">We have to leave anyhow, this area is -- couldn’t stay longer.</span></p> <p><span id="s2156">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2157">A: And so we -- we managed to merge with them.</span> <span id="s2158">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s2159">Q: Is this the one near Slonim, south of --</span></p> <p><span id="s2160">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s2161">Q: Or is not -- not yet?</span></p> <p><span id="s2162">A: Is what?</span></p> <p><span id="s2163">Q: The one near Slonim?</span> <span id="s2164">Is this --</span></p> <p><span id="s2165">A: Through Slonim, yeah the guys -- the guys from Slonim, and they came to our area, and of course they were in --</span></p> <p><span id="s2166">Q: Ah, they came to your area, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2167">A: Yeah, they came to our area, cause they had the big raids.</span> <span id="s2168">And y --</span></p> <p><span id="s2169">Q: And was this Orlovsky’s group, or is that another one?</span></p> <p><span id="s2170">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s2171">Q: Is this Orlovsky, or is this another group?</span></p> <p><span id="s2172">A: No, this ano -- not yet --</span></p> <p><span id="s2173">Q: Another group.</span></p> <p><span id="s2174">A: -- not yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s2175">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2176">A: It is not Orlovsky yet.</span> <span id="s2177">This is a group, a -- a group which splinter also, they -- they were a big brigades and they broke up in the smaller groups because they been running from -- they been going east, so they couldn’t go in one big brigade, there were a few hundred people.</span> <span id="s2178">So they broke up these small groups, and in this one was a Jewish group and we -- we -- some of them got together, and we merged with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2179">Q: And who was the leader of that group?</span> <span id="s2180">Was there a leader?</span></p> <p><span id="s2181">A: They had a leader, they have a -- they had a Russian leader.</span></p> <p><span id="s2182">Q: A Russian leader?</span></p> <p><span id="s2183">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2184">They had a Russian leader, and they figured that was better.</span> <span id="s2185">And we told the Russian leader, you know, where we were there, that the -- these guys before, they -- they killing the -- many people come from ghetto, they been killed there -- a lot of people have been killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2186">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2187">A: And he says why don’t you meet with this [indecipherable] we told him that you -- you commanding us, why don’t you meet with these guys, the Gorkinsens and tell them why the -- and ask them why did they kill people when they come from the ghetto?</span> <span id="s2188">So he met with this commander there, Tsygankov and he says, why do you kill th -- all Jewish people, they come from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s2189">So he says, don’t worry, if I’ll kill a hundred -- a hundred Jews, and one of -- and one would have been a spy, I would be f -- I would be justified.</span> <span id="s2190">That’s a -- that’s the answer --</span></p> <p><span id="s2191">Q: So that’s [indecipherable], right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2192">A: -- I’ll be justified, you know, that --</span></p> <p><span id="s2193">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2194">A: -- that -- that is really a -- you know, a situation [indecipherable] complain if you have no -- nobody to complain.</span></p> <p><span id="s2195">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2196">A: Yeah, they give you such answers, so much reason now [indecipherable] he brings you a -- a -- a good reason, kill a spy.</span> <span id="s2197">But it’s not a spy and not the -- not the spy, they just wants to kill the Jews --</span></p> <p><span id="s2198">Q: Jews</span></p> <p><span id="s2199">A: -- the Jewish -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2200">Q: And this second group was better, this gu -- this --</span></p> <p><span id="s2201">A: The one we merged?</span></p> <p><span id="s2202">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2203">A: Well, inside was better, but y -- we stayed there until [indecipherable] almost til the end of the year, end of --</span></p> <p><span id="s2204">Q: ’42?</span></p> <p><span id="s2205">A: ’43.</span></p> <p><span id="s2206">Q: End of ’43?</span></p> <p><span id="s2207">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2208">We stay with them, and -- but there was a big raid, a raid, the raid was -- they attacked us in the winter.</span> <span id="s2209">I don’t know which was [indecipherable] the year or that was the end of the year -- end of the ’43.</span></p> <p><span id="s2210">Q: Were you there with yo -- were you with them for about a year?</span></p> <p><span id="s2211">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2212">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2213">A: It was a -- we merged with them for a couple months later.</span></p> <p><span id="s2214">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2215">A: Couple months later there was a -- a -- you see, the -- the marshes freeze in the winter and so they had the -- the lake froze, so the German gro -- the militia what they had -- they had also Belarussian militia in there, they teamed up with the German SS, and they raided our camp, which it was easy to -- to come over because the -- the lake was frozen in the winter, and attacked us.</span> <span id="s2216">We didn’t have any casualties, but we just escaped, just -- just -- and the trouble started then with this -- you couldn't -- and things changed, this -- this Russian commander sort of was good, so long, til is -- he took in some Russian escapees from camp, or whom -- who were [indecipherable] Russian guys, and they didn’t like the way they -- they said the Jews are lazy bum -- you know, the Jews are really -- so the [indecipherable] so he -- he sort of agitated, you know, to be -- you know, h-he wasn’t anti-Semitic before, but he -- what they -- what they gave him lessons or something, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2217">And he changed, he changed, he wasn’t the -- he listened to them, the -- get rid of the Jews, get rid of the Jews, get a -- since then he decided -- he sort of took a group of Jews, small group and try to get [indecipherable] he don’t want to.</span> <span id="s2218">So [indecipherable] them, he took a -- went east.</span> <span id="s2219">So he l -- he left us -- he left the group from -- this Baranovichi group, probably [indecipherable] th-they separated -- they separate us again, cause, you know, it’s over.</span> <span id="s2220">The raids broke the whole thing --</span></p> <p><span id="s2221">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2222">A: And the -- the -- th-the -- he was changed, was became also anti-Semitic, yeah, because they -- they told him, they te -- they gave him a lesson.</span></p> <p><span id="s2223">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s2224">And he learned it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2225">A: They gave him a lesson, and again --</span></p> <p><span id="s2226">Q: We have to stop the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s2227">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s2228">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2229">End of Tape Seven</span></p> <p><span id="s2230">Beginning Tape Eight</span></p> <p><span id="s2231">Q: Okay, we left off and you said you were left alone, that this -- this guy just left you by yourselves again, right?</span> <span id="s2232">Or you decided to leave?</span> <span id="s2233">The second group.</span> <span id="s2234">The second -- the second resistance group you were in.</span></p> <p><span id="s2235">A: The second, when we merged with the other group?</span></p> <p><span id="s2236">Q: Yes, but then -- then you split from them, right?</span> <span id="s2237">Cause this guy, th-the guy who seemed not to be anti-Semitic became anti-Semitic.</span></p> <p><span id="s2238">A: Oh, the -- Pugachov.</span> <span id="s2239">That -- it was something that -- we went back -- we still had a Jewish group in existence, I mean, since they went back -- they went, they left people and they left the gr -- us, and were -- now, who does that?</span> <span id="s2240">They have -- the g -- the group originally, which was a s -- was sort of dismantled because you had a raid and people were running in different directions, til they grouped together it took a long time, couple weeks because you spread out who knows where, because it was a big raid.</span> <span id="s2241">Took a couple days until they burned the village, and took a few days and they were -- we were spreading out in the depths from the woods somewheres.</span> <span id="s2242">We didn’t know how fa -- long they stay, but they were -- tried to go back, but they were still stay -- the German forces were thi -- still in the village for a few days, you know, that’s unheard of -- it was unheard of til then, how long they stayed, they want to clean up -- clean out this area.</span> <span id="s2243">So -- but this commander of this group Pugachov is a Russian guy, and he start ta -- taking -- getting in more people like from the Russian prisoners -- Russian guys, prisoners, escaped prisoners.</span> <span id="s2244">And -- and there were s -- they were anti-Semitic, and they sort of talked them in.</span></p> <p><span id="s2245">Q: Right, you had said that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2246">A: Yeah, I said --</span></p> <p><span id="s2247">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2248">A: So to [indecipherable] against -- well, it turned out they eliminate Jewish people because they were the majority, and -- and they [indecipherable] the things to be there, they had the commander, he gave them everything.</span> <span id="s2249">He was like a big -- big commander, do -- do nothing.</span> <span id="s2250">So then there was a -- a call to go east, partisans should group east wa -- i-in deep -- deeper [indecipherable] because they could group together bigger units -- bigger partisan brigades, so they, because the German -- four German battalions were really active in -- in raids, and they figure if they th -- if they were grouped together, they still be stronger resistance and they would not be able to eliminate these group.</span> <span id="s2251">So he delayed that call til -- delayed until finally after the raid, and these two fr -- fre -- couple friends, the Russian escapees talked them in and say, he got -- he gotta do something, in other words, so he left.</span> <span id="s2252">Half of the group behind it -- he [indecipherable] from the old -- his old Jewish friends, the others, and the Russians, guys, and he took off east, he left us alone.</span> <span id="s2253">We had eight -- four rifles -- four rifles, very little arms.</span> <span id="s2254">In other words, we were a lot of pe -- we were 36 people, something.</span> <span id="s2255">And we tried to stay and maintain whatever we could do, try to get some contact, we couldn’t -- we couldn’t find any contact with any other groups.</span> <span id="s2256">So we’re by ourselves.</span> <span id="s2257">But the Gorkinsens, these were after us.</span> <span id="s2258">They want to get rid of us in that area.</span> <span id="s2259">They don’t want us in this area because it’s their -- their area, they say it’s their territory.</span></p> <p><span id="s2260">Q: So the -- the partisans want to get rid of you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2261">A: Yeah, it’s the Russian -- the Gorkinsens, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2262">Q: Or the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2263">A: They want to get rid of us and they don’t -- they no -- they don’t want us at all in that area.</span> <span id="s2264">They says, the -- the Jew, they -- they sort of a-afraid for their securities, not sec -- we are n -- we are ruining their hiding place -- their places [indecipherable] it’s just ma -- excuses.</span> <span id="s2265">They don’t want us in their area.</span></p> <p><span id="s2266">Q: Henry, what was your role in the resistance?</span> <span id="s2267">Now that you’ve been in for almost a year, I think, what were you doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s2268">A: What we were doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s2269">Q: No, you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2270">A: Me?</span></p> <p><span id="s2271">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2272">A: Well then, just waiting for good days.</span></p> <p><span id="s2273">Q: Just waiting for good days?</span> <span id="s2274">A: Yeah, waiting for the -- because we are really -- have nothing to do now.</span></p> <p><span id="s2275">Q: No, no, no, before, when you were in these two [indecipherable] group.</span></p> <p><span id="s2276">A: Before, y -- there was no -- you know, just pa -- comepra -- pa-patrol and that’s all, nothing much.</span> <span id="s2277">Patrolling the area was it.</span> <span id="s2278">Patrol --</span></p> <p><span id="s2279">Q: Uh-huh, and you’re patrolling what?</span> <span id="s2280">You’re patrolling to make sure the Germans are not there, or what?</span></p> <p><span id="s2281">A: Patrolling is so s -- you know, we been -- as we were s -- before, a separate group, we been raided.</span></p> <p><span id="s2282">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2283">A: And we -- we had s -- we lost stuff -- we lost the camp.</span> <span id="s2284">They raided camp and we had to leave to the other side.</span> <span id="s2285">So now we have to do it more secure they -- around the camp.</span> <span id="s2286">So we had to patrol around the areas with excess roads, watch the ol -- the oncoming [indecipherable] or raids or something.</span> <span id="s2287">So sort of -- sort of tried to be more careful now, cause we l -- we l -- almost lost two people, cause they were wounded in that raid, in the first raid.</span> <span id="s2288">So that was my doing now with --</span></p> <p><span id="s2289">Q: So now --</span></p> <p><span id="s2290">A: I didn’t have -- I didn’t have -- I didn’t have ver -- arms of my own.</span></p> <p><span id="s2291">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2292">A: Just the hand grenades, and therefore it’s -- those who had arms were more sort of obvi -- really, they -- nobody wants to give up their -- their arms if they have.</span></p> <p><span id="s2293">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2294">A: Nobody wants to give it up cause they’re not sure if they will get back, like -- but --</span></p> <p><span id="s2295">Q: So what happens now, you’re -- the group is alone again.</span> <span id="s2296">Do you find a third group?</span></p> <p><span id="s2297">A: So we sitting alone, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2298">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2299">A: And which -- one guy is in command, this -- he must be at le -- there must be one in command otherwise --</span></p> <p><span id="s2300">Q: So who was he, what was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s2301">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s2302">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s2303">A: What’s his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s2304">Q: Mm.</span> <span id="s2305">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s2306">A: I just remembered yesterday.</span> <span id="s2307">Oh, it’ll come to be, because --</span></p> <p><span id="s2308">Q: Okay, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2309">A: And -- Minek.</span></p> <p><span id="s2310">Q: What was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2311">A: Minek.</span></p> <p><span id="s2312">Q: Blinnick?</span></p> <p><span id="s2313">A: Minek -- m -- m-i-n-e-k, Minek.</span></p> <p><span id="s2314">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2315">A: He was -- sort of had the group.</span> <span id="s2316">Nice guy, and while it was cold, we were near the -- the river was frozen, we were camping near the -- near the Sharra river, so our road were -- the appro -- the -- the approach to our camp was through the river.</span> <span id="s2317">It was frozen, so it was like a -- was like a good road, like a highway.</span></p> <p><span id="s2318">Q: Yes, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2319">A: A frozen river was -- it was good --</span></p> <p><span id="s2320">Q: It’s a good --</span></p> <p><span id="s2321">A: -- was a good road.</span></p> <p><span id="s2322">Q: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2323">A: We could go, we could -- even though we could go with -- with -- with the horses, with things like that, and it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s2324">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2325">A: -- it was frozen good.</span> <span id="s2326">So we camped there, but soon, in February, sort of, the river gave -- the river was floating -- floating.</span> <span id="s2327">You know, February it start get warmer, so the warm weather melt the ice, the oncoming water is floating -- floating over -- is running over the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2328">Q: Campground --</span></p> <p><span id="s2329">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s2330">Q: -- where you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s2331">A: Is coming closer to our camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2332">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2333">A: Coming closer to our camp, we had to evacuate, go somewhere else.</span> <span id="s2334">In the first place, it a fo -- before that happened, we -- there were four others, they -- they -- we got from -- left for -- for us, for this group, the Gorkinsens want -- came to that [indecipherable] and they says lets -- you have to go for a certain operation.</span> <span id="s2335">The arm -- you have to s -- give me -- send all armed men with us, all the -- so we send four guys, we have four -- four arms, four guys.</span> <span id="s2336">And they -- when they came to the point where the -- they were introduced [indecipherable], this is the man in -- in command of this operation, he says he wants to look through the arms, everybody should check their arms.</span> <span id="s2337">So he -- they let them check their arms, but they never gave back.</span> <span id="s2338">They rob their arms in a nice way, in a nice way, in a tricky way.</span> <span id="s2339">In a tricky way they robbed the arms, and the -- when they came home without arms, we say that -- that’s the end of us.</span> <span id="s2340">We have no choice now, we -- I don’t know, we have to do something.</span> <span id="s2341">Well, it was t -- it was tough without arms, we couldn’t -- without arms you can’t -- can’t even get food, you know.</span> <span id="s2342">So we waited.</span> <span id="s2343">In meanwhile, the -- the -- the river was flowing and the camps a way -- and our camp was sort of getting more water and water, you see?</span> <span id="s2344">Soon enough, we’ll probably -- we’ll have to be stuck or can’t go further, or we’ll go s-sinking here, because the water is coming in fast.</span> <span id="s2345">So this commander, he send out two guys, two in different direction -- two in the one direction, and me and -- I went out with my friend Jonathan in one direction to look a way out.</span> <span id="s2346">If you don’t -- we always had the river for the road, but we have to find a way to go beside the river to get out of this area -- of this swamp -- of this swampy area or something.</span> <span id="s2347">So I have -- I have been good at that, I always have -- went out scouting, and I went out with my friend Jonathan and well [indecipherable] a couple hours looking around the area, how to get to -- out -- to make a way out in a dry way, not -- not into the water, and to -- so when the two other guys went a little bit on the different direction, they should look in that direction.</span> <span id="s2348">And I came back to reported this, we have a good way out and that’s all, we could simp -- not difficult to get out from here.</span> <span id="s2349">Found still a dry way -- dry land to go out.</span> <span id="s2350">The other two guys took a little longer time to come back.</span> <span id="s2351">Couldn’t ra -- didn’t [indecipherable] whether they got lost or something [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2352">They got lost, they got a little wandering around a little bit.</span> <span id="s2353">They couldn’t find it.</span> <span id="s2354">They came back -- they couldn’t find anything out.</span> <span id="s2355">They couldn’t find a way out.</span> <span id="s2356">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2357">As we sitting and goo -- discussing the reports of these ex -- the evacuation of ours -- camp, two Gorkinsens appeared.</span></p> <p><span id="s2358">Q: Who?</span></p> <p><span id="s2359">A: Gorkin -- the two guys from gor --</span></p> <p><span id="s2360">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2361">A: -- and says -- and they said, who the two guys who -- who -- yeah, they reported they met once of the -- one guy that met one of the Gorkinsens.</span> <span id="s2362">Okay, it wasn’t so clear, but anyhow they said they met one guy.</span> <span id="s2363">Okay, so these guys came and they said who are they.</span> <span id="s2364">Who are they, they say.</span> <span id="s2365">So these two guys raise their hands.</span> <span id="s2366">So they says come along to our commander, he wants to co -- ke -- ask you some questions because he wa -- you -- you came over and he wants to know why [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2367">Oh, we says, you know why, because I -- we wanted have a way out and we’re looking a way out.</span> <span id="s2368">Yeah, but to him -- you gotta explain to him, he wouldn’t take -- come along.</span> <span id="s2369">As they walked out, two minutes later, two shots.</span> <span id="s2370">So we -- this [indecipherable] our commander said well, tomorrow morning we have to go.</span> <span id="s2371">It’s no -- it’s no use to stay here, it’s no good.</span> <span id="s2372">So we figure, we lost two guys again, and no reason.</span> <span id="s2373">Well, we di -- we sort of made up that -- that was the -- towards the evening, in the evening.</span> <span id="s2374">That next morning we don’t wait too long, early in the morning we get out [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2375">And as we packed our stuff in the morning to get out, two guys are here [indecipherable] again from them, two other guys and they make sure that we -- that we are moving out.</span> <span id="s2376">They watched us going, so they went back to [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2377">Going on, we had no place where to go, cause everything -- everywhere is dangerous.</span> <span id="s2378">You know, sort of being pushed out to the edge, to the -- and we could not -- we find a place we stayed at -- we stayed a couple days in a place, we says it isn’t temporary -- it isn’t steady, but temporary, wait until we find the pet -- permanent place.</span> <span id="s2379">But again they showed up, more than one, more than two, the whole group.</span> <span id="s2380">And -- and we sort of -- so we had -- we left together, we had -- each one had two hand grenades.</span> <span id="s2381">We had the hand grenades, Russian hand grenades.</span> <span id="s2382">So you had them in the belts here, two hand grenades.</span> <span id="s2383">So they figured we don’t have arms, they finish -- they finish off us.</span> <span id="s2384">They -- they want to finish -- there was -- they took arms and they are alone, without arms.</span> <span id="s2385">Well, they came in, they looked around, see we still have hand grenades, I think they changed their mind.</span> <span id="s2386">They just, oh, I want to see where you -- where you settle -- where you settled.</span> <span id="s2387">You know, made themself in good friends.</span> <span id="s2388">Good friends.</span> <span id="s2389">And they left.</span> <span id="s2390">They saw the -- saw the hand grenades, they didn’t want to start a war.</span> <span id="s2391">Anyhow, we went further, what you say, again [indecipherable] decide it’s not the place to stay, because they will -- they’ll be coming in here and there.</span> <span id="s2392">If not today, they will come tomorrow again.</span> <span id="s2393">So we moved further out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2394">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2395">A: We moved out to a -- almost to the end of the partisan zone, you know, it’s almost -- very close to the German patrols, okay?</span> <span id="s2396">And over there we stayed a few -- couple days, and it ha -- still -- still I saw one or two of them coming -- coming nearby.</span></p> <p><span id="s2397">Q: What, of the -- of this -- from this other group?</span></p> <p><span id="s2398">A: To look a -- to look -- to se -- to find out where we -- where we s -- where we -- we camping.</span> <span id="s2399">There was a real tra -- strange thing.</span> <span id="s2400">At the same time, two our friends, those who were -- went out with j -- with the Pugachov, they broke up with them and they came back cause had t -- they have girlfriends here, in us.</span> <span id="s2401">So they had two rifles, each one had two guns -- they have two guns.</span> <span id="s2402">[indecipherable] we were happy to see them, cause with -- with two guns, at least we can defend ourselves, you know.</span> <span id="s2403">It’s -- and then we could get some food, also.</span></p> <p><span id="s2404">Q: So why did they come back?</span> <span id="s2405">Because they had girlfriends in your group?</span></p> <p><span id="s2406">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2407">That’s th -- it wasn’t very well organized where they left, but -- with Pugachov, so he was not commander any more, and they were sort of dispersed in different groups.</span></p> <p><span id="s2408">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2409">A: I think they were not -- they didn’t control where we is.</span> <span id="s2410">They left and they came to us -- their girls.</span> <span id="s2411">So we gonna have sitting this [indecipherable] situation if we get -- we has to be -- something has to be done, you know, we cannot just keep running --</span></p> <p><span id="s2412">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2413">A: -- there’s no place where to go.</span> <span id="s2414">So these [indecipherable] bring their two guns, so they go out into a village, to look for some contact with the other partisan groups, and maybe they would get some help.</span> <span id="s2415">They came -- when they came back they said they met some two guys, which are from the joka -- from the -- two guys -- they met in the village two guys and they listened carefully what they told them, and the two guys said, well it’s a very serious matter that si -- but we didn’t [indecipherable] we don’t believe it [indecipherable] they would say, right away we’ll solve the problem, said we’ll try, we’ll bring this new message to our commander and we’ll see what he could do it, cause he is -- he is this -- he is a powerful man, he could do it.</span> <span id="s2416">And it didn’t take long, the next day in the morning we saw these two guys, these same guys came back to our -- our camp, where we camped, and -- and they said, we told our boss and he was very upset, he heard what happened with -- he -- he know the Gorkinsens, he know this -- what they are, and he says from now on I’ll -- he’ll be taking care of that.</span> <span id="s2417">He says he’ll -- he’ll protect it from now on, because you are under my control.</span> <span id="s2418">Couldn’t believe it what they saw.</span> <span id="s2419">Sure enough, this was a powerful man, probably has the power to -- to give orders, the other --</span></p> <p><span id="s2420">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2421">A: And he says he came, explained that the -- we’ll take care, and we’ll set up we’ll disperse -- he’ll take our people and put them in Russian groups, he says, according the Russian law or something -- the Soviet law, no Yiddish -- Jewish groups alone, I mean for itself is illegal otherwise.</span> <span id="s2422">If you be in a -- in the -- in the groups [indecipherable] with Russians with protection -- with my protection, he says, he’ll -- they’ll -- they can’t say anything.</span> <span id="s2423">He start doing it.</span> <span id="s2424">He was a man who could do it, he has the power -- he had the power.</span></p> <p><span id="s2425">Q: And what was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s2426">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s2427">Q: What was his --</span></p> <p><span id="s2428">A: Orlovsky.</span></p> <p><span id="s2429">Q: It was Orlovsky.</span></p> <p><span id="s2430">A: Orlovsky was the very -- Orlovsky was a fighter --</span></p> <p><span id="s2431">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2432">A: -- in the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2433">It is shu -- I mean, I should have brung you my book from [indecipherable] where there was -- he teamed up with a -- but Orlovsky was just landed, he th -- he came -- he -- they parachu -- he parachuted with a group, a small group.</span> <span id="s2434">And he met the Jewish partisans from Slonim which were [indecipherable] after a raid, and they also had a -- couldn’t find together, they always were in -- split up.</span> <span id="s2435">And this guy, they would -- that the -- Liker, his name was Nathan Liker, and he says -- he explained to him as Nathan Liker saved his life.</span> <span id="s2436">This Orlovsky, when I met -- Nathan Liker was -- came from [indecipherable] and he met Orlovsky, and he found -- Nathan Liker found out from a -- from the other people -- the peasants, that the high commissioner is coming -- the high commissioner is coming to hunt pigs, wild pigs.</span> <span id="s2437">So they -- that Nathan Liker was happy to see -- see what now Orlovsky save orlos -- so he came to Orlovsky for help if -- if they want to attack this expedition, the hunting is -- so Orlovsky was very happy and Orlovsky took his people, he came and so together -- they got together 15 people and attacked -- and ambushed the expedition.</span> <span id="s2438">Of course there was success, but Orlovsky at the end almost -- he got -- had a -- a Russian -- they threw a Russian dynami -- dynamite pieces.</span> <span id="s2439">The explosive.</span></p> <p><span id="s2440">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2441">A: They had dozen explosives big as a brick, a small brick, and he -- you know, like our bricks in the shape of this, but a little smaller.</span> <span id="s2442">This brick has, if you put the fuse in, you can throw and explode it.</span> <span id="s2443">So he been throwing these bricks up at them, at the -- at the hunters.</span> <span id="s2444">And of course he was successful, but the -- the last one he picked up, a bullet hit this brick and it exploded --</span></p> <p><span id="s2445">Q: Exploded.</span></p> <p><span
