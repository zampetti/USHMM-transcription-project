<p><span id="s109">A: I was working together with my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: In the wood business.</span> <span id="s111">And how did you receive news of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: The war?</span> <span id="s113">See in 1938, we start to know the Germans, in Germany they start already, the attack on the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s114">So we heard that.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: What, word of mouth, or through the Forward newspaper?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: The papers had something, but we heard people talking about that.</span> <span id="s117">But we couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s118">Mine father, he remembered the war in 1914, you see -- the First World War.</span> <span id="s119">“And then the Germans come,” he said, “The Germans didn’t touch nobody, just took to work, but they didn’t kill.”</span> <span id="s120">You know.</span> <span id="s121">In 1914.</span> <span id="s122">And that’s how my father talked always.</span> <span id="s123">And this was different Germans, you know, this was Hitler.</span> <span id="s124">Before it was a King, Josef.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: Was there discussion in your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: Yeah, we discussed a lot of things with that.</span> <span id="s127">Always the old people would say, they would remember in World War I and they said, “ The Germans didn’t touch nobody.</span> <span id="s128">They didn’t kill.</span> <span id="s129">Just put you to work.”</span> <span id="s130">So work is, you know, not so bad.</span> <span id="s131">So that’s why everybody didn’t run away from the country, because we didn’t know exactly what’s going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: So you didn’t talk about fleeing your home.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: What happened then?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: In 1939, the Germans crossed the border, and it took just one week, they was in our place, by us.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: Were you occupied by the Russians at any time?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: First the Germans occupied.</span> <span id="s138">And then the Russians come in.</span> <span id="s139">But the Russians was about two weeks and the Russians moved.</span> <span id="s140">It was over there a river, the Bug, and the Russians moved back to the river and we had the Germans.</span> <span id="s141">The Germans took till the Bug, so we was in this place by the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: And the Germans occupied.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: The Germans occupied.</span> <span id="s144">After two weeks, the Germans took it right back.</span> <span id="s145">So then they right away start monkeying around with the Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: What did they do?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: They took you to work and they shot you, and they killed you right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: You saw things happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: Yeah, oh yeah.</span> <span id="s150">And they took the old people and start to make a Judenrat.</span> <span id="s151">You know which means a Judenrat?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: Why don’t you tell us.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: They chose some people.</span> <span id="s154">So the people, the Jewish people, the name was Judenrat.</span> <span id="s155">That’s Jewish Rat.</span> <span id="s156">It means they’re going to go along.</span> <span id="s157">The Germans gonna give you what to do and you have to do it with all the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s158">They gonna tell the Judenrat.</span> <span id="s159">For instance, they want a million dollars, they say to the Judenrat, “One week, you have to give a million dollars, otherwise 10,000 Jews gonna be shot.”</span> <span id="s160">They didn’t come to the Jewish people separate, but the Judenrat later come and collect the money from the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s161">So they chose a Judenrat, some from the best people from the downtown.</span> <span id="s162">It was about ten people.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: They had to go around to the Jewish people to collect money and valuables?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: Money, valuables -- money and to take to work.</span> <span id="s165">And the old people, they want 200 today to shot ‘em.</span> <span id="s166">They take ‘em behind, in the trucks, they take ‘em out of sight and shot ‘em.</span> <span id="s167">The old people.</span> <span id="s168">So everything, the Judenrat did.</span> <span id="s169">You didn’t hear about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: I did, but I think we ought to explain it for the purposes of this tape, as to how they operated.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: You see the Judenrat, it was ten people, and people, they know what to do.</span> <span id="s172">And the Germans, the Gestapo, come to the Judenrat, say everything, tell the Judenrat and the Judenrat come to the Jewish people, they talk to the Jewish people what the Germans wanted.</span> <span id="s173">And then it was through 1939.</span> <span id="s174">In 1940 they start take from all over the country.</span> <span id="s175">And they took from our place about 300 people -- young people -- to Belzec, in a concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: As I understand it, there were three camps.</span> <span id="s177">The camps were located in the town of Belzec.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: Belzec, yeah.</span> <span id="s179">And then it was Parawashnya, it was one camp.</span> <span id="s180">That was the place that the trains when they come, they repair the trains.</span> <span id="s181">You see the machines from the trains come in, they repair.</span> <span id="s182">The other camp, it was Molin, that is a mill where you ground some wheat for flour.</span> <span id="s183">And then there was Atartuk.</span> <span id="s184">Atartuk was the factory where you bring some wood and they cut the boards.</span> <span id="s185">So it was three camps in Belzec.</span> <span id="s186">I was in the Parawashnya camp.</span> <span id="s187">There was 20,000 people in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: And how did that happen.</span> <span id="s189">Did you go right from the town where you were living/</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: Yeah, they took us.</span> <span id="s191">To Dubyeshov, our town, there was not a train.</span> <span id="s192">There’s all horses with wagons.</span> <span id="s193">No machines, no trucks.</span> <span id="s194">Is come 300 wagons with horses and they took all of us in the wagons and this was to go 20 kilometers to Dubyeshov.</span> <span id="s195">And then they took us to Dubyeshov and then from Dubyeshov, they took us to the station, to the train, and we went to Belzec, to Tomaszow.</span> <span id="s196">This was the town near Belzec.</span> <span id="s197">This is the state, Tomaszow.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: What time of the year was that?</span> <span id="s199">What year?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: Let’s see -- it was warm outside.</span> <span id="s201">When started the war, what year?</span> <span id="s202">In May?</span> <span id="s203">June?</span> <span id="s204">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s205">This was 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: How many were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: We was there until 1941.</span> <span id="s208">In Belzec one year.</span> <span id="s209">Before the war break out with Russians.</span> <span id="s210">That was exactly the border with Russians.</span> <span id="s211">And we dig over there, we cut woods, and we dig walls for the Russian tanks not to go in to the Germans.</span> <span id="s212">You see, we cut woods over there, and we dig, very deep, and put the woods, and when the Russians come from over there with their tanks, to stop at the walls -- wood walls.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: To stop the Russians from advancing across the border there.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s215">Then, you see, before the war broke out with the Russians, they took us from over there, away, after one year.</span> <span id="s216">They put us on a train.</span> <span id="s217">It was there about 100,000 people, from all camps, and there was about 8,000 in the train.</span> <span id="s218">And they took us to Sobibor, a death camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: It was a death camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s221">Sobibor.</span> <span id="s222">Everybody knows of this camp.</span> <span id="s223">In Poland.</span> <span id="s224">They took us over there, but before we went, before Sobibor, the train stopped because they didn’t have the place.</span> <span id="s225">So many Jews were there, thousands and thousands, and they didn’t have the place for the train to go in.</span> <span id="s226">So this train stopped before Sobibor, maybe about 5 kilometers before Sobibor.</span> <span id="s227">And we were standing there in the train, we was all day and all night.</span> <span id="s228">People dying on the floors.</span> <span id="s229">You have to -- everything, on the floor.</span> <span id="s230">And the people dying.</span> <span id="s231">And when that was happening, we started to do something, so we knock out a wall.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: You were on the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: The train -- we knock it off the wall, from the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: You were like in a cattle car?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: Yeah, like cattle cars.</span> <span id="s236">I don’t know, maybe fifty, maybe 100 cattle cars at that time.</span> <span id="s237">Wooden.</span> <span id="s238">So we knocked out the wall, a door from the wall.</span> <span id="s239">We started jumping.</span> <span id="s240">But in the roof it was Gestapo with machine guns.</span> <span id="s241">In the train roof.</span> <span id="s242">Gestapo with machine guns.</span> <span id="s243">And the people started jumping -- hundreds and hundreds of people.</span> <span id="s244">And they start shooting.</span> <span id="s245">They kill everyone.</span> <span id="s246">But I jumped too -- I can’t remember -- maybe on the top of me was other people.</span> <span id="s247">They shot the people that was behind.</span> <span id="s248">And I didn’t know why I’m alive.</span> <span id="s249">So after midnight, the train start moving.</span> <span id="s250">And there was shot maybe about a thousand people -- dead -- where the Gestapo shot ‘em from the roofs.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">I start to come to myself.</span> <span id="s252">“I’m alive!’</span> <span id="s253">But I couldn’t crawl out from the dead people.</span> <span id="s254">I was strong, I start making me a place, and I touch mine self.</span> <span id="s255">I’m not hit -- nothing.</span> <span id="s256">So I left in the woods, and over there was people still alive, but hit.</span> <span id="s257">Who cares, you know.</span> <span id="s258">You don’t care for nothing.</span> <span id="s259">You don’t care for nothing!</span> <span id="s260">You care just for yourself.</span> <span id="s261">You want to live.</span> <span id="s262">To live is very strong!</span> <span id="s263">You want to live.</span> <span id="s264">So I run to the woods, and in the woods, this was not far from Chelm, and there was still Jews over there.</span> <span id="s265">There was still a ghetto.</span> <span id="s266">I went to the ghetto over there and started to talk to the Judenrat.</span> <span id="s267">To give me a card.</span> <span id="s268">They give out the red cards.</span> <span id="s269">You don’t have a card, you can’t be in ghetto.</span> <span id="s270">So they give me a card and I was in ghetto from 1941 to 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: Before we talk about the ghetto, could you tell us about life in these concentration camps you were in before Chelm?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s273">I was in Belzec.</span> <span id="s274">Over there, they give you ten gram –- a little piece of bread.</span> <span id="s275">And black coffee in the morning.</span> <span id="s276">And I was working two shifts.</span> <span id="s277">So much people, you know, two shifts.</span> <span id="s278">I was working from seven to twelve and at twelve we were brought back home, and from lunch the other shift went to work.</span> <span id="s279">So twelve you got a little bit soup, with a bone from the horse, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s280">But still, the peasants, the people that lived in the town, the Judenrat, brought every week some packages, food.</span> <span id="s281">The Germans allowed them to bring some packages of food.</span> <span id="s282">Bread and butter, something like that.</span> <span id="s283">The Germans allowed us to do that.</span> <span id="s284">The leader in this Belzec, it was a Major Dolff and assistant Votechko.</span> <span id="s285">Votechko was a Czechoslovakian German.</span> <span id="s286">He was of German origin but he lived in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s287">And Dolff, he was a German.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: And they were the ones that ran Belzec.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: Yes, they run Belzec.</span> <span id="s290">So every day they took us to work -- this was the border with the Russians.</span> <span id="s291">We saw the Russians across.</span> <span id="s292">We saw the Russians when we working.</span> <span id="s293">We even could speak.</span> <span id="s294">When you speak to the Russians, they shot you right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: Who, the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: The Germans, yeah.</span> <span id="s297">They find out, the Germans, he take your cap and throw it away to the Russians.</span> <span id="s298">The people was so dumb, you see, they run to pick up the cap.</span> <span id="s299">And he shot him right away.</span> <span id="s300">Because he said, “ You are on the run to the Russians -- across the border.”</span> <span id="s301">That’s what the Germans said.</span> <span id="s302">So they shot every day about twenty, thirty people.</span> <span id="s303">But later the Jewish people got a little smarter.</span> <span id="s304">In Chelm, in ghetto, I was working in a kitchen.</span> <span id="s305">Peel potatoes.</span> <span id="s306">I was over there one year, but later on we heard, some Gestapos have got Jewish people.</span> <span id="s307">They talk to them, and they make business with the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s308">So if they said, for instance, “Tomorrow they’re gonna take all Jews and they’re gonna be shot,” well this Jew come back and he said this, “Tomorrow” --and over there there was about a thousand Jews -- “everybody’s gonna get shot.’</span> <span id="s309">So when I heard this, I took off at midnight.</span> <span id="s310">We took it off midnight.</span> <span id="s311">My brother, he was in a little town Wojslawiec.</span> <span id="s312">This was 20 kilometers from Chelm.</span> <span id="s313">I know he lives there.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: What was he doing there, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: Over there there were 200 Jews and the Germans held them to work in this little town.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: How did you hear -- get letters from him?</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: Every second day, it was some people coming to Chelm from this town.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: And they told you about your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: Yeah, I know that my brother’s there.</span> <span id="s320">We can write a little, and my sister was there, and his daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: He’s older than you?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: Older, yeah.</span> <span id="s323">Why I have to go over there, I thought.</span> <span

id="s326">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s327">And I came to my brother and I told him.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: How long did it take you to get there?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: Some people, you see, drive some horses, wagons, so they took me.</span> <span id="s330">And I come to Wojslawiec, and I said to my brother, “ They gonna kill everybody.”</span> <span id="s331">This was in September, 1942.</span> <span id="s332">The Judenrat over there, know it already, tomorrow’s gonna be -- Gestapos are gonna shot everybody in this little town.</span> <span id="s333">So I talk to my brother, let’s go out to the woods.</span> <span id="s334">My brother accepted.</span> <span id="s335">And we got over there a gentile, a very nice man.</span> <span id="s336">He used to fight with Pilsudski.</span> <span id="s337">You heard of Pilsudski?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: The guy that’s in Poland?</span> <span id="s340">In 1921?</span> <span

Pilsudski.</span> <span id="s345">Then he was President.</span> <span id="s346">He was fighting with him, side by side -- the gentile -- with Pilsudski in 1921.</span> <span id="s347">So we went to this gentile.</span> <span id="s348">We explained to him what’s happened.</span> <span id="s349">He knows already.</span> <span id="s350">We said, “ We gonna pay you how much you want.”</span> <span id="s351">My brother has money.</span> <span id="s352">The gentile man had a farm, big farm, in the woods.</span> <span id="s353">His woods.</span> <span id="s354">And my brother go and took to make a bunker in this woods, to dig up a bunker.</span> <span id="s355">And he said he’ll allow us.</span> <span id="s356">And we dig from there a bunker -- all night and all day -- we cut the woods and we put her in.</span> <span id="s357">And on the top, on the bunker, we put some leaves, and then we put some grass.</span> <span id="s358">You got a little box, you open this and go in.</span> <span id="s359">Here you have it.</span> <span id="s360">(Uses a book to demonstrate.)</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: What’s the name of this book now?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: This is the name.</span> <span id="s363">The people, they lived in this little town Wojslawiec.</span> <span id="s364">This whole book is from the people.</span> <span id="s365">All the people, they come back from Russia, they was survivors, and they wrote this book.</span> <span id="s366">After the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: It’s all in Hebrew.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: No, that’s in Jewish.</span> <span id="s369">It’s in Jewish language.</span> <span id="s370">On the 28th of November, 1942, we went in the bunker.</span> <span id="s371">And we was in the bunker, two years.</span> <span id="s372">Two years we was in the bunker.</span> <span id="s373">It’s very hard to describe this.</span> <span id="s374">We went, every week, to bring some water, two kilometers.</span> <span id="s375">Over there it was water come from a stone.</span> <span id="s376">I don’t know how you call this.</span> <span id="s377">Very good water, clear water.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: Was it like from a creek?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: A creek, yeah.</span> <span id="s380">And we went every week, every Saturday night, and we got a pail.</span> <span id="s381">Mine sister went.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: You sister was with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: Yeah, she’s here.</span> <span id="s384">It was mine brother and my brother’s wife and a little girl from four years old in this bunker.</span> <span id="s385">And every week we went for the water.</span> <span id="s386">That gentile, he brought us to eat, every week he came and brought three, four loaves of bread, a little piece of butter like that, and we pay him.</span> <span id="s387">Every week we’d pay him -- in gold -- ten pieces of gold.</span> <span id="s388">But we had the money.</span> <span id="s389">My brother had a lot of money, that he got out of the factory, the leather factory, in the time from 1940 to 1942.</span> <span id="s390">Business was very good, you know, the black markets, like that, for the Germans.</span> <span id="s391">And the people, what they had, they bought it, so my brother saved a lot of money.</span> <span id="s392">So he paid the gentile with money.</span> <span id="s393">In winter time it was worse, a lot of snow, and we couldn’t open this little box to go out.</span> <span id="s394">The gentile have to come and open this, and then we can go out.</span> <span id="s395">Otherwise, if he don’t come, we die inside.</span> <span id="s396">Every week, Saturday night, he came over there with a sled and the horses.</span> <span id="s397">He brought to eat, and he wait till we going to bring some water.</span> <span id="s398">In the morning he come back and he closes everything.</span> <span id="s399">One week inside, we were sitting inside.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: What did you do all that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: Nothing.</span> <span id="s402">You just sit inside and in your mind, you get every day, you’re gonna die.</span> <span id="s403">Every day you got in your mind you gonna die.</span> <span id="s404">That’s all we got in the mind, for two years like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q; For two years you were in the bunker.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: Like that, yeah.</span> <span id="s407">Because you don’t know what’s happened.</span> <span id="s408">If the gentile will not come to you, you gonna die.</span> <span id="s409">You can’t go out.</span> <span id="s410">If somebody gonna go over there in the woods and find you -- the bunker--you gonna die.</span> <span id="s411">You can imagine what this is for two years to just talk about death.</span> <span id="s412">And everybody wanna live.</span> <span id="s413">Your life is to live.</span> <span id="s414">So we was for two years there.</span> <span id="s415">In summertime, 1944, the Russians come.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: How did you know that the Russians came?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: We heard it.</span> <span id="s418">They was about a quarter of a kilometer from this place where we were lying in the bunker.</span> <span id="s419">And I heard everything what they said, just standing by the bunker.</span> <span id="s420">I got afraid the tank comes, and the tank gonna fall down and gonna kill us, so I stayed by, behind a bush and watch ‘em.</span> <span id="s421">What they gonna do.</span> <span id="s422">They didn’t know I’m there.</span> <span id="s423">If they know I’m there, I’ll be shot.</span> <span id="s424">They don’t know who this is.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: Did you speak Russian or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: Yeah, I speak Russian.</span> <span id="s427">And I heard everything and they was all night there, and then the Germans run away, and so the Russians left, and everything was clear, and we still was three days in the bunker.</span> <span id="s428">Because I got afraid.</span> <span id="s429">And mine sister said she’d like to leave and I said, “No, we have to wait till everything is gonna clean up.”</span> <span id="s430">After three days she went out.</span> <span id="s431">She went to this town, Wojslawiec, where my brother used to live.</span> <span id="s432">And then my brother went to Wojslawiec.</span> <span id="s433">My brother’s name was Joseph.</span> <span id="s434">I begged him, “Don’t go.</span> <span id="s435">That’s burning, on fire.</span> <span id="s436">We can’t go in fire.”</span> <span id="s437">He didn’t listen to me.</span> <span id="s438">You could see the flames from the city.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Yeah.</span> <span id="s440">And I said, “Don’t go.”</span> <span id="s441">And he didn’t listen to me.</span> <span id="s442">He want to go over there to one gentile, because he got over there a lot of things hiding.</span> <span id="s443">He gave the gentile to hide them, some different things, shirts, dresses, like that.</span> <span id="s444">He wanted take back something.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: Back to the bunker.</span> <span id="s446">You were afraid that the Germans were still there.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: They were there!</span> <span id="s448">So he went over there, and he went to the gentile, and the gentile said, “Wait here.</span> <span id="s449">I gonna bring something for you.”</span> <span id="s450">Then the gentile went outside and he brought a German -- brought the Gestapo, and he said he had a “Jude,’ a Jew in his house.</span> <span id="s451">So the German come and took my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: Why did he do that, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s454">You don’t ask questions, the Polacks do everything, and they shot him.</span> <span id="s455">They shot him, that’s what it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: Right there at the farm?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A; They shot him in downtown, over there.</span> <span id="s458">And I went back to the farm and I told them this.</span> <span id="s459">I was with my brother.</span> <span id="s460">I was outside, watching.</span> <span id="s461">The door, it was glass.</span> <span id="s462">And I can see everything, except the gentile didn’t know I am outside.</span> <span id="s463">And I saw the German come in.</span> <span id="s464">He took my brother, he took everything away from him.</span> <span id="s465">So when I saw this, I run back to the farm, I ran to the bunker.</span> <span id="s466">And I come back and I told mine sister-in-law that’s it.</span> <span id="s467">He didn’t listen, you know, he didn’t want to listen.</span> <span id="s468">He got it.</span> <span id="s469">So in 1944, after the Russians came over here, and we went, after three days, my sister went to downtown.</span> <span id="s470">She met over there a Russian officer.</span> <span id="s471">No more Germans were there.</span> <span id="s472">It was the Russians already.</span> <span id="s473">And she met over there a Russian officer, a high officer.</span> <span id="s474">Higher than a lieutenant.</span> <span id="s475">And she talked to him, and he said he’s a Jew.</span> <span id="s476">So then she told him the story.</span> <span id="s477">He said, “So, you can come in this town, but till we are here, nobody gonna touch you.</span> <span id="s478">But we have to go farther.”</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: The Russian said, while the Russian troops were there, nobody would bother you, but they had to leave.</span> <span id="s480">They’ve gotta go get the Germans someplace else.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: They wanna go on, you know.</span> <span id="s482">So we went to this town.</span> <span id="s483">We was over there for a couple days.</span> <span id="s484">From the bunker to the town.</span> <span id="s485">You can’t see nobody.</span> <span id="s486">The children, they run after us, like they was just howling, “Jews still alive!</span> <span id="s487">Jews still alive!</span> <span id="s488">Jews still alive!”</span> <span id="s489">Polacks.</span> <span id="s490">Behind the back.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: Laughing.</span> <span id="s492">Making fun of you.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: Like they keep us, like crazy.</span> <span id="s494">They just hollering, “Jews still alive!</span> <span id="s495">Jews still alive!”</span> <span id="s496">And after three days we was in the town, we see nobody, we see Jews are there, but nobody laughed.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: Why was that?</span> <span id="s498">Why do you think that the Polish people were no longer shouting at the Jewish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: Because they got afraid already of the Russians.</span> <span id="s500">So anyhow, we saw this was not the place for us.</span> <span id="s501">I got afraid to go outside.</span> <span id="s502">We was with a gentile, his name was Goshkovski, and we was with him for three days.</span> <span id="s503">And he told us everything that’s happening.</span> <span id="s504">And we met over there a Russian truck driver.</span> <span id="s505">He was a Jew too, from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s506">And he told him to take us to Chelm.</span> <span id="s507">In Chelm there was more Jews already, a committee.</span> <span id="s508">We came to Chelm, there was already about 20 Jews that were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: Twenty Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A; Yeah.</span> <span id="s511">And we was four.</span> <span id="s512">And I went over there, asked what they gonna do.</span> <span id="s513">They said, “The government, the Polish government, gonna give us a room to live.”</span> <span id="s514">And they make like a “center,” a little center.</span> <span id="s515">They’d come in, they got already to eat, they got to give you bread, they got something they collect from the government and the Polacks.</span> <span id="s516">The Polacks was very good then, they got afraid of the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: How long were you there in Chelm then?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: 1944-1945.</span> <span id="s519">And then, that’s not a place for us, too.</span> <span id="s520">They start shooting the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: Who started shooting the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: Polacks.</span> <span id="s523">Midnight.</span> <span id="s524">The Russians went very far away and the Polacks took it over, their own police.</span> <span id="s525">So they start to look for Jews, and a couple Jews got shot from the Polacks.</span> <span id="s526">So I saw that’s not the place.</span> <span id="s527">So we went to Germany, occupied from the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: The Russian zone of Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A; Yeah.</span> <span id="s530">I went to Klewitz over there.</span> <span id="s531">It was better.</span> <span id="s532">You see, over there it was Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q; Where’d you stay?</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: Well, the Russians took away houses from the Germans.</span> <span id="s535">They give us.</span> <span id="s536">We stayed over there, and I was over there till 1946.</span> <span id="s537">I met my wife over there, and I got married over there.</span> <span id="s538">My brother was in the same town.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: Were you doing any work while you were there in this German town in the Russian zone?</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: Make some business -- little business.</span> <span id="s541">And then…you know what means a pogrom?</span> <span id="s542">I wanted to go back to Chelm, take a look what’s happened, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: Were there any people there that you needed to see?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s545">I was there one year.</span> <span id="s546">And go back to Czestochowa.</span> <span id="s547">That was a Polish town.</span> <span id="s548">I can’t explain it, a second town.</span> <span id="s549">I was in the train to Chelm.</span> <span id="s550">In Czestochowa, this was a big town, was a Polish organization, the name was Hakar.</span> <span id="s551">They was against the Jews too.</span> <span id="s552">They started shooting Jews over there.</span> <span id="s553">And they killed about 30 Jews, took off the Jews from the trains.</span> <span id="s554">I was sitting outside the train, because I didn’t have a place to go in.</span> <span id="s555">The train was packed.</span> <span id="s556">You couldn’t go in the train.</span> <span id="s557">So you got steps.</span> <span id="s558">I was sitting on a step.</span> <span id="s559">So, you see, the Polacks go in -- the Polish police -- he asked me in Polish if maybe I saw here Jews, to tell him who’s a Jew.</span> <span id="s560">He didn’t recognize I’m a Jew.</span> <span id="s561">And I said, “I don’t know.”</span> <span id="s562">And I hear, over there, a Jewish woman -- she got a little girl, maybe about seven years old -- and she talk in Polish, loud, she knows I’m a Jew, and she said, “who’s going to be alive?”</span> <span id="s563">-- to take care of her little girl.</span> <span id="s564">and he took care of her.</span> <span id="s565">He shot her.</span> <span id="s566">The woman.</span> <span id="s567">But the girl start crying, “Mother!</span> <span id="s568">Mother!”</span> <span id="s569">And he shot the girl too.</span> <span id="s570">So, we come to Lublin.</span> <span id="s571">Lublin was a big town in Poland.</span> <span id="s572">Over there was a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s573">Then -- who was the Rabbi from Cincinnati?</span> <span id="s574">Silver, from Cincinnati.</span> <span id="s575">And he came to Poland, to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s576">He heard everything.</span> <span id="s577">He heard how they killed the Jews and everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: What year was this that Rabbi Silver came?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: 1946.</span> <span id="s580">And he was in the government in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s581">And the government knows whatever was going on here, shooting the Jews on the way from Czestochowa.</span> <span id="s582">Then they sent Polish officers to take care for that, not to let them shoot the Jews.</span> <span id="s583">I was in the train at Lublin.</span> <span id="s584">Then five officers -- Polish -- come in and said, like that, “Who’s a Jew, to come to see us.”</span> <span id="s585">You know?</span> <span id="s586">“We gonna take care, nobody gonna touch you.”</span> <span id="s587">I got afraid to go, because I thought maybe this is something make it up!</span> <span id="s588">But I didn’t have a choice.</span> <span id="s589">And I said to them, “I’m a Jew.’</span> <span id="s590">He said, “Sit down here.”</span> <span id="s591">And the other two Jews left over in the train, they took us to Lublin, and there was a Jewish organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: Which organization was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: A Jewish committee.</span> <span id="s594">There was a lot of Jews already, was a couple of hundred Jews.</span> <span id="s595">And they had a kitchen.</span> <span id="s596">They cook over there, and they took care of the Jews left over.</span> <span id="s597">And I was over there a couple days.</span> <span id="s598">And from over there I come back to the Jewish committee.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: Did they have an office or something like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A; Yeah, they had an office.</span> <span id="s601">They had a whole building.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q; And what happened there?</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: There they give us a place to sleep.</span> <span id="s604">And they give us to eat.</span> <span id="s605">Then my brother-in-law, he come and look for me.</span> <span id="s606">And I met him.</span> <span id="s607">And he said, “ You go with me,’ and we went back home to Woldenburg.</span> <span id="s608">This was 1946.</span> <span id="s609">Woldenburg was German -- occupied by Russians, Polish-Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: And what year was that that you went there?</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: 1946.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: And you went there with your wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: We were married in 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q; I still don’t understand why it was that you wanted to go to Chelm.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: Make business.</span> <span id="s616">In Chelm, was everything cheap.</span> <span id="s617">In Woldenburg, everything was expensive.</span> <span id="s618">I went over there and bought 5 kilo butter.</span> <span id="s619">Everything you brought back.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Helen: We sell it.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: You met your wife in Woldenburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: No, in Claivitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: And then you moved to Woldenburg, so Woldenburg was really your hometown.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: Did you stay in Woldenburg until you came to this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A; No.</span> <span id="s627">when I came back, I said to my wife, “No more in Poland!</span> <span id="s628">They start shooting the Jews.”</span> <span id="s629">And after two days , we went to the Czechoslovakian border.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">H.M: We went first to Haganah.</span> <span id="s631">First you went and talked to Haganah, and you wanted to leave Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: Did you want to go to Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: We don’t got our passports.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: What did the Haganah tell you?</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: Be ready and we’re gonna take you.</span> <span id="s636">So we went to Czechoslovakian border, and it took us about one hour and we crossed to Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Q: Were you planning still to go to Palestine at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s639">I didn’t know I have some relatives here in the United States.</span> <span id="s640">I know it, but I didn’t know where they was, you see.</span> <span id="s641">So we were maybe going to Palestine.</span> <span id="s642">And we was in Czechoslovakia about two days, and they took us to Vienna, Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: Who took you to Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: The Haganah.</span></p> <p><span

address.</span> <span id="s682">The names I know it.</span> <span id="s683">And I don’t know nothing.</span> <span id="s684">After four weeks, I receive a letter.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: Who was the letter from?</span> <span id="s686">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: The letter was from an uncle here.</span> <span id="s688">I receive a letter saying they was communicating with mine uncles -- the Jewish organization in New York -- and they told him.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: I would think like a Jewish Family Service.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: A Jewish

business with American soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: With American soldiers at the PX we sold some coffee there.</span> <span id="s710">I bought it and sold it to the Germans -- the German people.</span> <span id="s711">A trade.</span> <span id="s712">So we got over there very good, very good in Germany.</span> <span id="s713">We was over there ’46 to ’51.</span> <span

Committee.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">H.M: The UNRRA.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: The UNRRA, and the Joint.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: The United Nations Relief Organization also helped you come to this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: Yeah, helped us.</span> <span id="s728">To eat, food, to wear some clothes and everything.</span> <span id="s729">They give us, yeah.</span> <span id="s730">Mine uncles paid off everything here to bring us over from there to come here.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: What do you mean by that?</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: It cost money.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: It did?</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: Yeah, they paid.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: Who did they have to pay?</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">H.M: First of all, we came by ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: I think they had to pay.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: They had to pay the passage.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">H.M: And then when we came to New York, then the Joint took us over -- from New York, and then they sent us fees.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: What did the Joint Committee do for you when you got to New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s742">H.M: For me they didn’t do anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">A: Because we came private.</span> <span id="s744">Because we came from the uncles.</span> <span id="s745">When you came from the Joint, they give you everything, but the uncles took us, so the uncles have to pay -- they give $10?</span></p> <p><span id="s746">H.M: Just one moment.</span> <span id="s747">When we came to New York, was a Saturday.</span> <span id="s748">In the meantime, I met some cousins.</span> <span id="s749">I wrote to them.</span> <span id="s750">My mother’s sister knew I’m coming, and we came, they wanted us to stay with them a few days, and the Joint say, “Mine job is to take ‘em to the depot and fix ‘em up to Saint Paul, because they need some help.”</span> <span id="s751">And the cousin say, “ No, we will take them.</span> <span id="s752">Let them stay a couple days and we’ll bring ‘em back.”</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: They were responsible.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">H.M: They say, “I’m responsible for the people.</span> <span id="s755">Let ‘em stay a few days and I will bring them, I will take ‘em to the depot and buy them the tickets and sent them to Saint Paul.”</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: You had relatives in Saint Paul then.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">H.M: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">A: When I came here to Saint Paul, after one week, I filled out an application to Whirlpool Corporation.</span> <span id="s759">And I was working there for nineteen years.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">H.M: We saved money.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: We saved the money, and my wife was working, and I bought a five-plex at Goodrich and Victoria, and we was living over there and I was the caretaker, and she was sweeping the steps.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">H.M: I was cleaning everything.</span> <span id="s763">It was very hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: And we was living over there.</span> <span id="s765">It didn’t cost me rent.</span> <span id="s766">And so we paid off this, and I have it still now.</span> <span id="s767">I still have it, and that’s a very good income.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">H.M: The reason that we moved from Victoria here, because my daughter wants to go to Highland High School, because it’s a very excellent school and she wants to go to a very good school.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: So I’m now okay.</span> <span id="s770">I got everything, and I’m very happy, and I like very much the country.</span> <span id="s771">Very much!</span></p> <p><span id="s772">Q: I just want to summarize here.</span> <span id="s773">During all the time that the war was going on, were you getting any news from anybody about what progress was on the war?</span> <span id="s774">Did you receive any news?</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s776">The gentile come in the woods in the bunker.</span> <span id="s777">And he told me everything.</span> <span id="s778">He told me, “This, today, the Germans are here and here.</span> <span id="s779">And they fight here and do not take more.”</span> <span id="s780">He told me, “Six months, the war’s going to be over.’</span> <span id="s781">But took more than six months.</span> <span id="s782">And every day he come he had some papers, he told me the news.</span> <span id="s783">And he told me, “Don’t worry, we’re gonna live.</span> <span id="s784">Don’t worry, we’re gonna live.”</span></p> <p><span id="s785">H.M: He told you, “If my son-in-law wouldn’t kill you, then you will survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s787">He said he got a son-in-law.</span> <span id="s788">And the son-in-law was very ACA, and they don’t like Jews.</span> <span id="s789">And he said, “ If mine son-in-law will not kill you, you gonna be alive.”</span> <span id="s790">But one night he came over.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">H.M: Well, he was drunk.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: He was drunk, and he said, “ I’m gonna kill out all of ‘em.”</span> <span id="s793">I said to him -- his name was Tadjik -- I said, “ What you want, Tadjik?”</span> <span id="s794">So he got softer, and he said to me, “You have to buy me a machine gun.”</span> <span id="s795">I ask him, ‘ What you need the machine gun?</span> <span id="s796">To kill me?”</span> <span id="s797">He said, ‘ No, I wanna go out kill Germans.’</span> <span id="s798">He was drunk.</span> <span id="s799">I gave him some money to buy a machine gun.</span> <span id="s800">And the second day he come with a big machine gun.</span> <span id="s801">He put it right on the ground there by the bunker .</span> <span id="s802">He knocked and I come out.</span> <span id="s803">He said take a look at this machine gun, you give me the money.</span> <span id="s804">Now we’re gonna go kill Germans.</span> <span id="s805">But he went, I don’t know if they rob Germans, they kill ‘em over there because the Germans, they stopped, you see, they run away.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: The Germans were running away.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: Away, yeah.</span> <span id="s808">So they kill ‘em.</span> <span id="s809">They run away, they took away everything from the Germans.</span> <span id="s810">The whole damn town was there and he said, “That’s all.</span> <span id="s811">The Germans run away, the Russians come, we gonna be alive.”</span> <span id="s812">But when we went out from the bunker, I didn’t have nothing.</span> <span id="s813">I got bare foot.</span> <span id="s814">No pants.</span> <span id="s815">Everything was pulled down in the bunker.</span> <span id="s816">It was rags.</span> <span id="s817">So the old man come to me, “Come.’</span> <span id="s818">Like that, see.</span> <span id="s819">“take a look how you walk to me.”</span> <span id="s820">I said, “ I know, I’m looking.</span> <span id="s821">I don’t have nothing.”</span> <span id="s822">So you know what he’s told me?</span> <span id="s823">“You don’t have nothing and I don’t have nothing and this money you give to me, I was drinking.</span> <span id="s824">I drink all the money when you give to me because mine brains was working every second -- They gonna catch me over there, the Germans.</span> <span id="s825">They gonna kill the whole family.”</span> <span id="s826">The gentile family too.</span> <span id="s827">But they didn’t know the gentile’s family kept us, and who hold a Jew, you know, they kill ‘em right away, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">H.M: Not many gentile people hide out some Jewish people.</span> <span id="s829">You could count them on your fingers.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q: Can you tell me what it means to be a survivor of the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: You see when I was in the bunker, is everything was in my mind; to be alive, to build back my family, to sit by table and eat by table.</span> <span id="s832">You understand?</span> <span id="s833">To sit by a table and to build back my family.</span> <span id="s834">This was the survivor.</span> <span id="s835">In the bunker I was nothing.</span> <span id="s836">Nothing.</span> <span id="s837">You sit and you lie down in the bunker -- you just -- your mind was just on killing and dying.</span> <span id="s838">Maybe tomorrow, maybe the day after tomorrow.</span> <span id="s839">What are you doing here?</span> <span id="s840">Why you should be here?</span> <span id="s841">Go out, get shot.</span> <span id="s842">Why you have to be here one year, and maybe half a year later get shot – much better right away?</span> <span id="s843">Not suffer in this bunker?</span> <span id="s844">You know what suffering is in a bunker for two years?</span> <span id="s845">And somebody sit in jail for two years?</span> <span id="s846">He got everything.</span> <span id="s847">He got a room and he got light, everything.</span> <span id="s848">He didn’t wanna sit in jail.</span> <span id="s849">In the bunker -- dark.</span> <span id="s850">No air, you know, and sit in a bunker, you can’t go out.</span> <span id="s851">You like to get in company with the animal, but with a human being you can’t get in company, because you know if he see you, he’s going to go to the German and tell him, “Over there is a Jew.”</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Q: Just one more question.</span> <span id="s853">After your experience during the Holocaust, could you please describe your general feeling about human nature, non-Jews and Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s854">A: I hate very much the Germans.</span> <span id="s855">Very much.</span> <span id="s856">Because they kill sixty-four people from mine family.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">Q: Sixty-four people.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s859">In my family.</span> <span id="s860">Brothers and sisters and children and everything -- and not counting second cousins -- sixty-four people.</span> <span id="s861">I don’t have nobody besides the sister -- she was with me in the woods.</span> <span id="s862">She’s here.</span> <span id="s863">And that’s all.</span> <span id="s864">And mine wife now, and my children.</span> <span id="s865">Yeah, and I have a niece in Israel from my brother.</span> <span id="s866">She survived.</span> <span id="s867">She’s in Israel.</span> <span id="s868">Here, the people, is a lot of anti-Semitic here too, in the United States.</span> <span id="s869">A lot of it.</span> <span id="s870">I can’t believe it --the best men -- the best gentile -- your friend -- I don’t believe it.</span> <span id="s871">When something happened, is your friend gonna be the first one he wanna kill you.</span> <span id="s872">The first one!</span> <span id="s873">The best friend!</span> <span id="s874">You thought, you mean he’s your friend!</span> <span id="s875">Like here, people got friends, yeah?</span> <span id="s876">He gonna kill you the first one!</span> <span id="s877">He come to you and he take away everything, he’s gonna kill you.</span> <span id="s878">That’s mine.</span> <span id="s879">I don’t believe it, I can’t take it.</span> <span id="s880">The government, maybe, it’s not too bad, the government don’t let it be anti-Semitic like that, but we have a lot of ‘em here, too.</span> <span id="s881">Is an article today in the paper.</span> <span id="s882">It’s article from a professor.</span> <span id="s883">He’s an Arab, but he’s a professor in the United States.</span> <span id="s884">What he wrote -- about Israel, to Reagan -- he told him not to give to Israel, to help, nothing.</span> <span id="s885">He’s anti-Semitic, too, a big one.</span> <span id="s886">A very big one.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q: Have you read any books or seen any movies about the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s888">A: Yeah, I was always at movies.</span> <span id="s889">I watch ‘em, but some people can’t take it, but I watch ‘em.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Q: Do you think they tell the story right?</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A: What you see in the television is not 10%!</span> <span id="s892">You still have 90% you have to see it.</span> <span id="s893">I can’t tell you.</span> <span id="s894">I saw in the ghetto was a building.</span> <span id="s895">In the building was maybe a hundred families -- Jewish families living -- big buildings.</span> <span id="s896">And the Germans come, in the building.</span> <span id="s897">They took all the children, there was a big truck, by the windows, and they throw the children in the truck!</span> <span id="s898">Through the windows.</span> <span id="s899">They throw 500 children, but the mothers couldn’t take it -- they jump themselves, too.</span> <span id="s900">That’s what I saw with mine eyes!</span> <span id="s901">And how you know that, if I don’t tell you.</span> <span id="s902">There was a girl from seven years old.</span> <span id="s903">And she was alive, in the truck alive.</span> <span id="s904">So they took all the children -- some in the hospital.</span> <span id="s905">They sucked out the blood from the children for the soldiers -- for the German soldiers -- they had to give them some blood for the soldiers -- they got wounded in the front, you know.</span> <span id="s906">And the father from this girl was a doctor.</span> <span id="s907">And he went to the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s908">And he pay a lot of money to bring the girl back.</span> <span id="s909">The Gestapo brought the girl back.</span> <span id="s910">And the girl told everything what’s happened to them and the children.</span> <span id="s911">How you can talk about things like that --you can’t talk about things.</span> <span id="s912">You see a lot of things.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Q: Do you have any photos, mementoes, or other things from that period that you’d be willing to share?</span></p> <p><span id="s914">A: We got some, but the Czechoslovakian border they took everything away.</span> <span id="s915">Even the passports.</span> <span id="s916">When we come we didn’t have nothing.</span> <span id="s917">The Polacks took away everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">Q: Do you think that your belief or practice in Judaism or a Supreme Being has been changed by the Holocaust experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s919">A: I belong to the Lubavitcher here.</span> <span id="s920">I go to Lubavitcher.</span> <span id="s921">Why I’m going over there, my father was a very religious man, you see, and I can’t forget this.</span> <span id="s922">My wife’s at home.</span> <span id="s923">She fights with me, why I go over there.</span> <span id="s924">I go over there because when I go over there -- I don’t do very much, but Pesach, I go over there, and on the holidays -- when I go over there, you see, I’m back at home.</span> <span id="s925">You understand?</span> <span id="s926">I’m back at home.</span> <span id="s927">This here is exactly like home.</span> <span id="s928">But I’ve changed a lot, very changed.</span> <span id="s929">We believe in God, but when it’s happened like that for six million Jews, rabbis and Hasidim, and BIG rabbis -- they shot ‘em, they burned and everything, and nobody answers for nothing, I question, Where’s God?</span> <span id="s930">I believe, but I am changed.</span> <span id="s931">I never ate meat -- we buy in a store meat, I never ate it.</span> <span id="s932">Because why?</span> <span id="s933">You see, the Jewish religion, I know very good.</span> <span id="s934">You buy the kosher meat, but is not kosher, either.</span> <span id="s935">Because in the old country it was a lot of difference.</span> <span id="s936">You see here, meat, when you have three days in a shop, when you don’t put some water on the old meat, it’s not kosher.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">H.M: That’s a tradition I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: A tradition doesn’t stop.</span> <span id="s939">That’s not tradition, that’s kosher.</span> <span id="s940">If they don’t do that, it’s not kosher.</span> <span id="s941">And then he drive the car on Saturday.</span> <span id="s942">When he drive a car on Saturday, his meat is not kosher.</span> <span id="s943">You understand?</span> <span id="s944">That’s the religion!</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: So what you’re saying is that some of the traditional things are no longer done.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s947">You have to know.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: I’m running out of tape here unless you had anything else to add.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: Tell me.</span> <span id="s950">What you gonna do with that?</span></p> <p><span id="s951">Q: This tape is going to be made available.</span> <span id="s952">It’s going to be part of a library on the Holocaust, and it will be used for educational purposes.</span> <span id="s953">There’ll be a transcript made, and from there there’ll be summaries made of each of the interviews.</span> <span id="s954">And they’ll be put together in a little book.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">H.M: Well, for instance, a lot of people have passed, are dying already.</span> <span id="s956">And who will tell what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s957">Q: That’s why we’re getting on this right away and why we’re doing the interviews now, and I’ve been brought in to work on this, to set these up as quickly as I can, and get them done.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">H.M: It’s the same like you have to tell what happened in Egypt, with thousands of years, you know?</span> <span id="s959">And maybe this is what the tape recorder is for -- something!</span></p> <p><span id="s960">A: You have the Pesach -- the holiday -- yeah?</span> <span id="s961">You got the first day and second day and make a seder, yeah?</span> <span id="s962">And you want to make a seder now, from the Germans, for what’s happened.</span> <span id="s963">It’s a lot more to do.</span> <span
