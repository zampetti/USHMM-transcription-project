I was born in Brussels, Belgium in 1933 and I lived there with my mother and father until 1940 when the war exploded and we ran away to France.</span> <span id="s5">My problem at the time was that I was in a hospital and in many ways I was responsible for saving my family's life because they thought that I should be in a sanitarium no matter what was happening.</span> <span id="s6">So, my father picked me up and we went off to France to find a place for me and the rest of the family stayed there and, of course, none of them survived.</span> <span id="s7">I lost my grandfather, all my uncles and aunts.</span> <span id="s8">One uncle survived, but he had married a Catholic and my grandfather disowned him so, to this day, he's still alive.</span> <span id="s9">We have difficulty in relating to him.</span> <span id="s10">An aunt survived.</span> <span id="s11">There were nine children in my father's family and of those everyone but two were killed.</span> <span id="s12">My mother's side were all from Warsaw, and she never heard from her parents again.</span> <span id="s13">But her sisters lived in Paris, and there were five sisters.</span> <span id="s14">Two of them went to concentration camps.</span> <span id="s15">One wound up in Russia and then came to America afterwards.</span> <span id="s16">She just died recently.</span> <span id="s17">And my Tante Burnka from Paris, she hid for four years behind a wall in Paris at my aunt's place where my uncle was the shoemaker.</span> <span id="s18">And he had been captured during the war as a prisoner of war.</span> <span id="s19">And they didn't know he was Jewish so he survived the camps over there as a prisoner of war.</span> <span id="s20">My cousin from Paris, when we got over there, joined the French underground and he was all of 16.</span> <span id="s21">He was six years older than I. And there he was quite an apparition when he showed up one day and he was a wild man.</span> <span id="s22">And he had joined the most militant of all the underground groups, which was a left-wing Jewish outfit.</span> <span id="s23">And he was into really getting the Germans to the point that even my father was scared of harboring him in our house.</span> <span id="s24">You know we were in the middle of France.</span> <span id="s25">I'm getting ahead of the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">JB: You were in a hospital?</span> <span id="s27">You were sick?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">AM: I was in the sanitarium in Belgium.</span> <span id="s29">I was seven years old.</span> <span id="s30">And I had a spot on my lungs, which nobody ever figured out how it got there.</span> <span id="s31">The myth is that I got a sun stroke and got burned or something happened, which other doctors claim was part of TB.</span> <span id="s32">And I was in the hospital for about a year when I was six to seven.</span> <span id="s33">Then the war started on May 10th, 1940 and I was still in a hospital in St. Charles when my father took me with my little sister and my mother.</span> <span id="s34">And we smuggled across the French border because we--evacuees were not allowed to go through to France.</span> <span id="s35">The French would try to stop the flow of people at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">JB: So you had a sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">AM: My little sister was one year old.</span> <span id="s38">She was born in 1939.</span> <span id="s39">So the most momentous moment at that time was that when we were being smuggled across with her she would be crying.</span> <span id="s40">But, you know, we could be discovered up there.</span> <span id="s41">Luckily my mother was nursing her so that solved the problem.</span> <span id="s42">When we got to France the French army got a hold of my father and drafted him right then and there to go in the army.</span> <span id="s43">And he knew that the war was lost and if he got caught he probably would be a prisoner of war.</span> <span id="s44">So he had told my mother--he didn't speak hardly in French, I was the translator at seven actually, from Yiddish to French--so before we got to Paris my father said, "Well, you know, your name is Armand now.</span> <span id="s45">And you're not called, Avrum no more.</span> <span id="s46">And you're not to speak Yiddish anymore except when your mother speaks to you, and you translate in to French.</span> <span id="s47">And if anybody asks you, you tell them it's Flemish."</span> <span id="s48">Which, when we went to France most people didn't know what it was, in the part where we were.</span> <span id="s49">And he left us and he told us to go south and he would find us.</span> <span id="s50">And he gave us a train schedule and all that.</span> <span id="s51">The train was strafed and we were stopped right in the middle of France where the tracks had been blown up.</span> <span id="s52">And we were just let go in the middle of a town and somebody let us have a stall from the stable.</span> <span id="s53">My mother and my little sister and I were in there and I progressively got sicker, a fever and of course it wasn't very clean so I had lots of diseases from the bugs and all that kind of thing.</span> <span id="s54">But my father, which was I would say three months after that, had deserted the army and had managed to find us.</span> <span id="s55">And it was the most incredible kind of thing because he was able to trace us.</span> <span id="s56">We had left messages with a Belgian family and there weren't that many going in that direction.</span> <span id="s57">And he found us.</span> <span id="s58">And when he saw me he did something very dramatic and very adventurous.</span> <span id="s59">He just stopped the first truck he saw on the street, which happened to be a gasoline truck.</span> <span id="s60">And he had a rifle with him and he had the uniform of a French soldier and well he said to the man that, you know, he had to take his son to the hospital.</span> <span id="s61">And, after much protest, but not too much choice for the driver, he took us to a place which was a sanitarium, in the mountains of the Auvergne, Clermont-Ferrand.</span> <span id="s62">And in that sense, I think that I was responsible for saving my family because they wanted to be close to me and they found a town, Volvic, which was about four miles away, to be close to me.</span> <span id="s63">And I was put in this sanitarium for adults, in the woman's ward, which was a most unusual experience since I was the only little boy in a room full of, you know, women who were dying of TB.</span> <span id="s64">And I was there for about six months and they took very good care of me.</span> <span id="s65">Then I was transferred to a prevantorium.</span> <span id="s66">And this was 1941 when it was about the worst time.</span> <span id="s67">My father in the meantime, he was amazingly adaptable, to become everything, an electrician, a milkman, a cheese maker, and finally he fell into a job that was as a surgical orthopedist.</span> <span id="s68">He didn't know anything about it.</span> <span id="s69">He was a leather maker, I mean he was a glove maker originally.</span> <span id="s70">And there he made contacts with somebody who was in the underground, Captain Durain, that he still knows today.</span> <span id="s71">In the meanwhile I was getting to be nine years old and had skipped about three years of school by now and I was still in hospitals with this very fragile constitution.</span> <span id="s72">So my father was always looking for extra food and bread.</span> <span id="s73">And the only thing that at the time was possible was wine, which was supposedly a medicine.</span> <span id="s74">So he would bring me a bottle of wine every week that the doctor recommended, which I suspect might have been my undoing for the future, but I think that when I finally got better and my little sister Eliane was already four, my other sister Yvette was born.</span> <span id="s75">And I joined them in this little town where we were completely hidden and that my mother was passed off as Dutch.</span> <span id="s76">I was put into a regular school.</span> <span id="s77">And my father didn't fight the church priest of the town from, you know, having me go to catechism and to Catholic school even though I knew that it was all a subterfuge.</span> <span id="s78">And I found that I could get along very well just assimilating and becoming invisible.</span> <span id="s79">To this day I don't speak Yiddish, but I understand it perfectly.</span> <span id="s80">But I think the affects of that are so long-lasting.</span> <span id="s81">We found that we had no contact with family.</span> <span id="s82">There was no way of finding out what had happened.</span> <span id="s83">And the contacts that I had were very tenuous because the Gestapo, after France was declared an open country all the way through, they started to come into our town and looking for the underground.</span> <span id="s84">So I was witness to a few raids and atrocities when I was nine, ten.</span> <span id="s85">And those are the stories I tell my students as I teach now.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">JB: So you really grew up in those years from seven...</span></p> <p><span id="s87">AM: To fourteen.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">JB: To fourteen...</span></p> <p><span id="s89">AM: Before I came here.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">JB: In a subterfuge.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">AM: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">JB: Like a Marrano, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">AM: That's right.</span> <span id="s94">And I knew that I was Jewish, and I enjoyed the games of fooling the priest.</span> <span id="s95">But I was doing it with Catholic boys who had no idea what I was about, so that I could never have an open friendship with anyone.</span> <span id="s96">And in that sense I always felt that I was very different.</span> <span id="s97">There was no antisemitism because there were no Jews.</span> <span id="s98">But when there was any mention in the church, it was always mostly economics so I knew that...</span></p> <p><span id="s99">JB: What about the, your own little nuclear family?</span> <span id="s100">Did they, were they able at that time to maintain any semblance of Jewish life internally or were they afraid also to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">AM: No, my father was marvelous in trying to keep up, at least the rudiments, of the traditional holidays.</span> <span id="s102">And one time even I remember 1942, '43, he had found out through a network that there were a few Jews who lived in the countryside and that were gonna have a seder.</span> <span id="s103">So we walked there seven miles, just myself and my father because my mother was going to stay with my two sisters.</span> <span id="s104">And we went there and there was a farmhouse.</span> <span id="s105">It was all hidden.</span> <span id="s106">And it looked like a biblical scene.</span> <span id="s107">The men were at the window making sure that nobody was coming.</span> <span id="s108">And we had one matzo that somebody had made.</span> <span id="s109">It was a most moving and memorable kind of experience.</span> <span id="s110">We weren't very religious but that, everybody cried, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">JB: How many people were there at that seder?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">AM: There were about, well, I think 15 men with children, men, I mean boys over ten.</span> <span id="s113">So they had a minyan and a few more.</span> <span id="s114">And there were no Haggadahs but people remembered enough.</span> <span id="s115">And we never saw anybody else who went to a seder, you know, meeting in any kind of way except casually on the street.</span> <span id="s116">But...</span></p> <p><span id="s117">JB: What was the name of the town that you lived?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">AM: We lived in Volvic, which is near Clermont-Ferrand in the Auvergne.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">JB: Volvic?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">AM: Volvic.</span> <span id="s121">And Clermont-Ferrand was, well that's where they make Michelin tires now.</span> <span id="s122">It was a place that was very important for the Resistance as well as being a place that the English would bomb to get rid of the Michelin tires.</span> <span id="s123">There weren't too many Jews in that area because most of them had been picked up and sent to Drancy.</span> <span id="s124">And we knew about that so we were [unclear] there.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">JB: Do you remember anything of your life until you were seven, in Belgium?</span> <span id="s126">How much of it do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">AM: Quite a bit because I was, I would say from five on, constantly exposed to my larger family for the holidays, for any kind of family gatherings.</span> <span id="s128">And the pictures that we had, hundreds and hundreds of pictures, always stimulated, you know, remembrances of the time.</span> <span id="s129">So I found that I remember quite a bit, in the sense that our family was left of center?</span> <span id="s130">Very left of center.</span> <span id="s131">My grandfather was, I don't know, he kept talking about Russia and thinking that, you know, they would come to their senses.</span> <span id="s132">And nobody believed him but still, he was a marvelous, marvelous man my grandfather.</span> <span id="s133">A long beard--I think I grew one because of him--and great hands.</span> <span id="s134">He was a skillful engraver.</span> <span id="s135">And he would pop up in the middle of the night at my house and just pick me up.</span> <span id="s136">And I remember that; I was five, six.</span> <span id="s137">Much ado was made by my parents.</span> <span id="s138">But still, he was a presence that was so overwhelming.</span> <span id="s139">Oh, my father too, who deferred to him on all matters, really.</span> <span id="s140">I don't recall ever going to synagogue before I was seven.</span> <span id="s141">But I do know one thing that as the war ended and I was just about 13, there was for sure going to be a bar mitzvah.</span> <span id="s142">And even though there was no time for me to learn Hebrew, the whole ceremony was transliterated into French and I did study for six weeks intensely, since I was going to be the first bar mitzvah in Brussels after the war.</span> <span id="s143">So that was very significant.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">JB: You went back to Brussels then?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">AM: We went back to Brussels after the war.</span> <span id="s146">My father was, had been involved with fighting at the end because he had come out as being part of the Resistance.</span> <span id="s147">And then we went to Paris just as, it had been liberated by the French, by the French Army or the American Army really.</span> <span id="s148">And there was nobody there.</span> <span id="s149">And my father was trying to find any survivor.</span> <span id="s150">And he found that my cousins, three children from a sister, had survived and had been put into a Catholic home and he wanted to get them out of there.</span> <span id="s151">The Jewish organization was able to reach them too, and they were interested in getting them to Palestine.</span> <span id="s152">And my father came and you know, said that they had the choice of going to America, since our cousins in Philadelphia had offered us passage.</span> <span id="s153">So they decided to come along and then they came over here two years afterwards.</span> <span id="s154">But we went back to Belgium before the end of the war and we were bombed by the V-1s and V-2s that never got to England because at that time, during the Battle of the Bulge, we were in Brussels.</span> <span id="s155">And this was the end of, the winter of '44.</span> <span id="s156">And the war didn't end till the spring of '45.</span> <span id="s157">So that we were exposed to that kind of thing where there was nothing you could do, because if you were in a building and you could hear this bomb flying over and if it stopped, was silent, either it went straight down or the house would be blown up, whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">JB: When you went back to Belgium, was there anyone there from your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">AM: One sister, Tante Raymonde, who somehow had managed to, I don't know how she did it, but she survived and she found us an apartment.</span> <span id="s160">And she's still alive today, very sick, and she has a disintegrating spine.</span> <span id="s161">She is getting a little...</span></p> <p><span id="s162">JB: Where is she?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">AM: She's in Belgium now and my father's there with her.</span> <span id="s164">She was just put into a home for incurables.</span> <span id="s165">She's 68.</span> <span id="s166">She was the youngest of the family.</span> <span id="s167">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s168">JB: The parents?</span> <span id="s169">Your grandparents?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">AM: Everybody was gone.</span> <span id="s171">They were taken in '42 and we got the lists back of their deaths confirmed from Buchenwald and their names are on a monument now in Belgium.</span> <span id="s172">So that's my grandparents, and my aunts, and my uncles, all cousins.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">JB: When you were in school in the little town in France, hiding the fact that you were Jewish, what kind of association was there in terms of the townspeople knowing what was going on?</span> <span id="s174">Did they have any indication what was happening with the Nazis?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">AM: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s176">They had an indication of what was happening because the Nazis always came in to try to get their goods.</span> <span id="s177">They were farmers.</span> <span id="s178">They wanted all their food and all that.</span> <span id="s179">And they were fairly patriotic.</span> <span id="s180">There weren't too many collaborators in that town because there was a strong bed of resistance.</span> <span id="s181">But as far as consciously being aware that I was different and that I might be in danger from the people in the town?</span> <span id="s182">No, I didn't feel that.</span> <span id="s183">As a matter of fact there was a raid from the Gestapo and all the important people in town were taken away of which the priest, the doctor, the head of the school.</span> <span id="s184">And this was a little town of maybe 500 people.</span> <span id="s185">So, they took all the leadership and sent them to concentration camp.</span> <span id="s186">And in that sense it made them certainly much more resistant to the Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">JB: Did you know that Jews were the focus of...</span></p> <p><span id="s188">AM: Oh certainly.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">JB: You knew it.</span> <span id="s190">Your family knew it.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">AM: Oh yes, sure, sure.</span> <span id="s192">We had heard stories from before the war, because my father was politically active, and he knew about concentration camps.</span> <span id="s193">And he was begging his father to run away because he believed the stories that were happening in Nazi Germany.</span> <span id="s194">My grandfather didn't believe them and he said that, you know, God would take care of him.</span> <span id="s195">Well, he certainly did.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">JB: So you knew, living in a Catholic environment and passing yourselves off...</span></p> <p><span id="s197">AM: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">JB: ...as Catholics.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">AM: No, no, not Catholics.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">JB: Not Catholics.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">AM: We said we were Christian, vaguely, non-den-, you know, not Catholics because then we would have had to go to Church officially as their members.</span> <span id="s202">But my father always played a whatever was the dominant, he would be the minority as long as it was still kosher.</span> <span id="s203">But in that sense I had to go to the Catholic school for Catholicism because all my friends in school were, and the priest would have raised an eyebrow and all that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s204">And I developed a real strong curiosity for history during that time.</span> <span id="s205">And that made me fairly objective too.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">JB: When you were in Belgium until you were seven, eight, that age, did you live in a Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">AM: For a while, and then, which was completely Jewish and on the left.</span> <span id="s208">But then my father found a job as a glove maker in an ar-, working for, of course, for a Jewish concern.</span> <span id="s209">But there were no Jews around me, so that that made us feel like we were also strangers in a neighborhood.</span> <span id="s210">I guess it started us to guard ourselves at that time because I remember, at that time, being taught it was O.K. for antisemitic remarks in school, especially when St. Nicholas would come around and I didn't celebrate.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">JB: As a young child in Belgium?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">AM: As a very, first grade, you know.</span> <span id="s213">I was six or seven.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">JB: Was there any interaction with the community as Jews, with the non-Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">AM: No, no, there weren't, because at the time the fascist party, the Rex party, was so, so dominant and antisemitic--it would have been the equivalent of the Klan--that Jews kept a very, very low profile.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">JB: So that your experience, until you returned to Belgium, was pretty negative.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">AM: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">JB: Antisemitic remarks while you were...</span></p> <p><span id="s219">AM: Very young.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">JB: Very young, and then hiding the fact that you were Jewish, for survival.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">AM: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">JB: What prompted the decision at the end of the war to come to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">AM: Well, there was a GI that showed up in Paris when we were there.</span> <span id="s224">It happened to be a cousin in Philadelphia who was looking for us.</span> <span id="s225">He knew that there was a brother who had children.</span> <span id="s226">And this was Hymie Nathanson from Strawberry Mansion.</span> <span id="s227">And he was an MP.</span> <span id="s228">And he came over, he brought presents and boxes and things.</span> <span id="s229">He said, "You have relatives.</span> <span id="s230">You know, you're not alone.</span> <span id="s231">Come to Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s232">We'll help you.</span> <span id="s233">You're a glove maker.</span> <span id="s234">We'll start you in business, whatever."</span> <span id="s235">My father at the time was debating whether really he shouldn't go with whatever friends were left in Belgium to Palestine, you know.</span> <span id="s236">And at the time the decision was that, "Well, if somebody's gonna give us a hand then it will be easier in America."</span> <span id="s237">And so in 1947 with all the papers--luckily we were Belgians therefore on the quota list, we were way up there on the list, we never had too much difficulty--we got a boat in Göteborg, Sweden and landed in New York, which was a most amazing experience to see those buildings and all those lights and all that food!</span> <span id="s238">God!</span></p> <p><span id="s239">JB: Who came with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">AM: My mother, my two little sisters, and my father.</span> <span id="s241">And we were set up on Stanley Street in North Philadelphia, Strawberry Mansion.</span> <span id="s242">And my father promptly failed in business and then went to work for somebody else.</span> <span id="s243">And I learned English, since I didn't know any English.</span> <span id="s244">And I learned English at the Lawson School in South Philadelphia and then we to Fitzimmons for six months and then to Central.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">JB: Armand, you indicate that your family and you knew during those years of the war what was going on.</span> <span id="s246">Do you feel that you knew the extent of it, of the concentration camps and the extermination policy of the Nazis or did you learn more after the war was over?</span></p> <p><span id="s247">AM: I think that we had this unreasoning, nebulous fear that my father was able to inculcate in us because of his contacts, and telling us that the worst thing is what they did.</span> <span id="s248">And then it was confirmed when we saw actual Gestapo tactics in our villages and the stories of the tortures that they did in the Gestapo headquarters.</span> <span id="s249">So why wouldn't they do that to Jews if they took them to concentration camps?</span> <span id="s250">So that it wasn't proven until really the middle of the war, but by the end we were pretty certain, before they discovered the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s251">There was such a hatred of the Jews from the Belgians.</span> <span id="s252">They considered themselves blood brothers of the Germans, the Flemish part, that there was no doubt about their intentions if they had a chance.</span> <span id="s253">And lots of times countries like Belgium and France, the antisemitic element there was stronger than the Nazis in terms of turning in the Jews.</span> <span id="s254">So we always felt that if they could think it, they would do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">JB: So essentially those of your family who came to the United States after the war, who were saved, was your immediate family...</span></p> <p><span id="s256">AM: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">JB: ...and the two female cousins you spoke of earlier.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">AM: And one male cousin, Charlie Kimozhay.</span> <span id="s259">He was a doctor in Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s260">And that was it, out of a family of about 55.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">JB: You remember all of them, or most of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">AM: I remember most of them because we were very, very close in terms of meeting every week, at least twice a week.</span> <span id="s263">So that my little cousins, who were the same age, we grew up on, the only ones I could really let my guard down with.</span> <span id="s264">And we were intimates, just like brothers and sisters rather than cousins.</span> <span id="s265">So that I remember them very, very, very fondly and certainly nostalgically.</span> <span id="s266">Willy Boy, well Boy is a funny name.</span> <span id="s267">His name was really, he had another name but my grandfather called him Boy so everybody called him Boy.</span> <span id="s268">Boychik.</span> <span id="s269">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">JB: You maintained your French name.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">AM: I maintained my French name, yes, because there was a turnaround when I was 14, I came to this country.</span> <span id="s272">I mean, I was bar mitzvahed as Abraham, but my birth certificate had been burned and my new one with identity and all that kind of thing was changed so that, at the time, it seemed that it was more convenient.</span> <span id="s273">Then my father decided to go back to Mednicki and by that time I was a teenager and I decided, no, I would drop the "I" and be Mednick.</span> <span id="s274">And then a whole business of identity became important in America and I decided to become French rather than Jewish because it was a great help in high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">JB: What, tell me about your bar mitzvah.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">AM: Well, there was one synagogue in the center of Belgium, in Brussels that was rededicated after the war.</span> <span id="s277">And there weren't too many young people who had lived in Belgium who the rabbi had known about so that when my father found out that, you know, it would be possible to have the bar mitzvah there, he made arrangements then we moved pretty close to it, actually.</span> <span id="s278">And we gathered all the family that we could for my bar mitzvah.</span> <span id="s279">My uncle came back from a prisoner of war camp, from France, and my cousin, who was crippled because he had been in prison with the Germans and he had been put into some torturous thing.</span> <span id="s280">And he's still crippled but he's quite a brain.</span> <span id="s281">And the whole family was there.</span> <span id="s282">And it was standard in the sense that I got, all I remember at the end was really all these pens and watches.</span> <span id="s283">It was just like any other bar mitzvah except that it was all in French.</span> <span id="s284">And the first part of the parshah was Vayakhel that I remember to this day!</span> <span id="s285">But I never learned Hebrew really.</span> <span id="s286">And it was a symbolic day.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">JB: Do you remember when you first heard the name Hitler?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">AM: I'm sure I heard it all the time because there were political conversations all the time in my father's house.</span> <span id="s289">However, as far as being the genius of evil that, you know, he never struck me as being terribly different from the other names.</span> <span id="s290">I mean, they talked about Leon Blum and Daladier and Chamberlain in the same breath as they did Hitler at the time.</span> <span id="s291">You know, there was no war.</span> <span id="s292">But afterwards Hitler just became this absolute giant, god-like, evil figure that has pursued my memory for ever since the war has been over.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">JB: You know, because you are younger than so many survivors, it's as if your total early life was involved with subterfugian escape.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">AM: Mmm hmm, yes, it's true.</span> <span id="s295">And I'm sure that it has shaped my whole life from that.</span> <span id="s296">I am very reticent to socialize really.</span> <span id="s297">I don't go into community action of any sort.</span> <span id="s298">I, you know, very much keep to myself.</span> <span id="s299">And I'm sure that that has made it's mark on me.</span> <span id="s300">Just general staying back and making sure I don't get hurt again.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">JB: Your father is still alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">AM: My father is still alive.</span> <span id="s303">And he is 73, very gregarious, and an absolutely marvelous man whose, I'm afraid, also high point of his life was the war.</span> <span id="s304">Except there he was in his full glory in that he survived by, you know, using subterfuge and marvelous feats of wit.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">JB: Your mother and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">AM: My mother died in 1963 from a disease called demphigus, which is a form of lupus.</span> <span id="s307">And my sisters are alive, both married, one in Jersey, one in Texas, Austin.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">JB: Because they are younger, do you think they have the same affect?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">AM: No.</span> <span id="s310">I spoke to them about this.</span> <span id="s311">They don't recall any of it.</span> <span id="s312">All they remember is right after the war, a little bit in Belgium, but nothing from the war itself experience.</span> <span id="s313">Except some of the things that are memorable such as getting a present from the Red Cross in the middle of the war and my sister biting through the orange not knowing about the peel, or a banana that she had never seen--that kind of thing.</span> <span id="s314">But nothing that they experienced themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">JB: Do you, in your relationship with those cousins who have survived and are here, do you have a particular relationship with them that you think was formed because of these experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">AM: Absolutely, especially the older sister, the eldest, who is now becoming a doctor.</span> <span id="s317">She's 53 and she's been at it 20 years.</span> <span id="s318">It's amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">JB: Really.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">AM: She is the one who has the best memory of it, because she was the oldest.</span> <span id="s321">And as a matter of fact about three months ago she came here and we spent a whole afternoon talking about things that she doesn't talk with her sister and brother that much: the day she saw her parents taken away by the Gestapo, the day that she knew that, you know, there's a good chance that they might not survive unless they actually became Catholic in the convent, her sister, and not knowing where her brother was, and the terrible kind of turmoil in knowing that there was nobody to rely on.</span> <span id="s322">And it's coming up now more frankly.</span> <span id="s323">The pain is still there but at least we can talk about it.</span> <span id="s324">But my relationship with my cousin is based mostly on the fact that we came ov- Tape one, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s325">AM: Is it on now?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">JB: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">AM: My relationship with my cousin, Charlie, is based much more on the fact that we're both from Europe, speaking French, and survivors and being really like brothers in America for four years of intimate living--we lived in the same room, actually--and exchanging our reaction to, you know, the new country as well as the old, and not so much based on the war experiences as well.</span> <span id="s328">Very totally different.</span> <span id="s329">And we did discuss it, but never in depth when we were young.</span> <span id="s330">It was just too close.</span> <span id="s331">It takes about 30 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">JB: Because I'm in a unique situation of knowing about your work, would you talk a little bit about the plaques that you've completed and why you undertook them, and what it's meant to you to have done that series?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">AM: Well, just about the time that my mother died in '63 things began to happen to my work in terms of...</span></p> <p><span id="s334">JB: Your work as a potter.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">AM: As a potter, on the wheel and things.</span> <span id="s336">And figures were appearing that I had no idea where from.</span> <span id="s337">Eventually, by 1970, I knew that I had to exorcize this whole experience in some tangible way because I couldn't really talk about it to my father because we just, I mean we were just a mutual kind of crying society.</span> <span id="s338">But I worked it out so that from 1970 to 1982 I started to make the reliefs of a symbolic, mythical kind of personal view of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s339">And I think that it took that long because if I had done it faster it would not have been as deep and as satisfying to my own peace of mind.</span> <span id="s340">I don't feel, or believe that it's over now but it certainly feels that I have set aside some of those nightmares that had no names because at that age you just cannot respond rationally.</span> <span id="s341">The things were certainly not exact or they are not representational.</span> <span id="s342">But they certainly represent a kind of journey through my mind about what I imagine my family, who went to these concentration camps, had to endure.</span> <span id="s343">I also felt that it was important for anyone that had any way of expressing it, aside from speaking, had a responsibility to pass on something tangible because we would go soon and I always believed that clay would last forever.</span> <span id="s344">And this was one way of doing it.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">JB: Have you exorcized?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">AM: No, but it's helped a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">JB: The interesting thing about the plaques is that they are experiences in your psyche.</span> <span id="s348">They are not experiences that you witnessed, because many of them are concentration camp scenes.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">AM: That's right.</span> <span id="s350">That's right.</span> <span id="s351">It's artistic freedom to express one's deeper feelings about a horror that cannot be expressed in words really.</span> <span id="s352">And I found that the clay and the absolute irony of having to use an oven to fire them, just struck me as being something that had to be done.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">JB: And maybe a way of putting those people to rest for yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">AM: For myself, yes, except that it's important in terms of my own peace of mind that remembrances be constant.</span> <span id="s355">Not every day but certainly on a regular basis.</span> <span id="s356">And if those things are around there's no way that the people that I care about would forget.</span> <span id="s357">Certainly I won't.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">JB: O.K.</span></p></body></html>
