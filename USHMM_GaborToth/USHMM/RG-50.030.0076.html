It was really a lot of walking, no other source of transportation, and that's basically you know what I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: Do you recall what happened... Of course, you were very young then... when the war broke out.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: I..</span> <span id="s18">.</span> <span id="s19">The only thing that I basically remember as far as that was that my mother carried like a suitcase along with her and as we went along, I remember she periodically had to open that suitcase and give away certain, you know, articles like a little...she had a brown handbag...and when she gave that away it meant having another meal.</span> <span id="s20">And I remember she took with her jewelry and every time she had a piece of jewelry to give away that...and when I saw her giving it away it mean that, you know, we were going to have a little bit more food to get us through to the next trip and the next meal.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: You were separated from your mother at a young age.</span> <span id="s22">Can you tell us about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s24">Uh, when we reached Belgium, uh, I was separated from her and, uh, through the.</span> <span id="s25">.</span> <span id="s26">the underground really did all that.</span> <span id="s27">We had moved into a..</span> <span id="s28">.</span> <span id="s29">into a room where this woman who belonged to the Catholic church and she got a hold of the priest who then in turn worked with the underground and I was taken to a convent at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: What happened before you separated from your mother?</span> <span id="s31">Where did your mother take you?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: Uh, Before I separated from my mother what we did is we went to a..</span> <span id="s33">.</span> <span id="s34">from Austria we...most of it was really again through walking or sometimes a truck would pick us up.</span> <span id="s35">And we went to Calais, France.</span> <span id="s36">And in Calais, we were all--I do remember, we were put in jail there.</span> <span id="s37">And, uh, somehow we got out of there.</span> <span id="s38">That.</span> <span id="s39">.</span> <span id="s40">I..</span> <span id="s41">we.</span> <span id="s42">.</span> <span id="s43">I don't know how we were able to get out, but we did get out and the march started again until we finally reached.</span> <span id="s44">.</span> <span id="s45">uh.</span> <span id="s46">.</span> <span id="s47">Belgium.</span> <span id="s48">And once we.</span> <span id="s49">.</span> <span id="s50">we got to Belgium that is when, uh, people who were just taking us...in other words, the head of some of these groups were able to make various contacts; and that is how we got to this woman, Mrs. Degelas.</span> <span id="s51">And she then, in turn, contacted the...the priest.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: Tell us about Mrs. Degelas?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: Mrs. Degelas was, uh... Well, to me, of course, she looked old.</span> <span id="s54">I was young.</span> <span id="s55">So, I would say...now that I recall, she was probably a woman in her 40s, who lived with her husband in a very nice...in Brussels, Belgium.</span> <span id="s56">Uh... She seemed like a very lovely lady.</span> <span id="s57">She owned quite a large house.</span> <span id="s58">I think the best way describe it would be here it would be like...it would like a townhouse, I believe.</span> <span id="s59">And this townhouse was divided into separate rooms and she gave us... Now when I say us, that means there were 30 of us.</span> <span id="s60">She let us utilize that room as long as we had a need for it and, uh, the only problem was that I could not stay with my mother at that point because number 1, I was a child and number 2, my mother also had to take care of my grandparents who were with her and in the room with us.</span> <span id="s61">But I think what they were afraid of more than anything was the noise level because I didn't have a full understanding of.</span> <span id="s62">.</span> <span id="s63">that a war was on or what the idea of all this was.</span> <span id="s64">I mean I knew no other life, so this was just part of, you know, everyday living.</span> <span id="s65">And, uh, when they told me that I had to, you know, go away for awhile, well, I just...I just went.</span> <span id="s66">(laughter) I didn't have any choice.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: Where did you go from here and what are your recollections?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: From.</span> <span id="s69">.</span> <span id="s70">uh.</span> <span id="s71">.</span> <span id="s72">uh.</span> <span id="s73">.</span> <span id="s74">there I was put into a..</span> <span id="s75">.</span> <span id="s76">into a convent which was also located in Belgium, and some man came and picked me up that I had never seen before.</span> <span id="s77">That scared me slightly.</span> <span id="s78">And he told me on the way that the reason for all the things that were going on was because I was Jewish which, of course, didn't mean anything to me.</span> <span id="s79">I was just too young to understand what Jewish meant.</span> <span id="s80">But that I was going to go and live in...in a school.</span> <span id="s81">And when I got there.</span> <span id="s82">.</span> <span id="s83">uh.</span> <span id="s84">.</span> <span id="s85">I saw nuns which scared me a little bit because in Europe, of course, not like today, the nuns were all in habits and it was a very, very strict order.</span> <span id="s86">And he took me to the Mother Superior and the Mother Superior tried to explain as much as she felt I could understand that I was going to be into school and that I was going to be living with other children there during the day.</span> <span id="s87">However, those children leave at the end of the day and I was going to be taken care of by the nuns.</span> <span id="s88">I was also told that I was going to be taught religion and that my name would be changed to Susanne Ledon, and this was name that I would... that I can only answer by.</span> <span id="s89">I have to forget my other name, that there was no more name like that because this was going to be something totally new and I just have to follow these rules.</span> <span id="s90">So I..</span> <span id="s91">.</span> <span id="s92">I did.</span> <span id="s93">And she handed me some medals and with a safety pin and she told me every time that I memorized what each metal meant that I would get a new one.</span> <span id="s94">And I did.</span> <span id="s95">I started memorizing different.</span> <span id="s96">.</span> <span id="s97">uh.</span> <span id="s98">.</span> <span id="s99">prayers for medals and she gave me a rosary and she taught me how to do the rosary and this went on for periods of time.</span> <span id="s100">Uh, I think the most frightening part of the experience was the evenings because I was taken to what seemed like a dormitory that had miles upon miles of just corridors and they were just all partitions in between and I was put into one of these partitions that had a bed, a sink, and a huge crucifix and one of the nuns was.</span> <span id="s101">.</span> <span id="s102">was in charge, and I was left in this dormitory at night.</span> <span id="s103">That was rather scary.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">And, uh, I would just say in my prayers.</span> <span id="s105">(crying)</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: Can you recall for us some of the things you did from day to day in the convent?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: Uh, well during the days...on some days when they felt it was safe, I would go to a class with the rest of the children but (crying, crying, crying) I'm sorry... Thank you.</span> <span id="s108">I don't mean to do this.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: Just relax.</span> <span id="s110">Take a drink.</span> <span id="s111">A: I didn't mean to do this.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: It's alright.</span> <span id="s113">Take as much time as you need.</span> <span id="s114">A: Am I holding you up?</span> <span id="s115">Oh, God.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: We're here for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: I swore I wouldn't do this.</span> <span id="s118">(Crying) Q: You don't know what to expect.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: I know, it's just as... I hope they stopped the cameras from rolling.</span> <span id="s120">There goes the mascara.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">I'm okay.</span> <span id="s122">I'll be fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: You were tell me about the day-to-day.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: Yah.</span> <span id="s125">The day.</span> <span id="s126">.</span> <span id="s127">day to day was...there were certain days I could go to school, uh, for maybe an hour or 2 and that was just to get me to mingle with the other children, but the problem was that they would start questioning me and there was always a nun that had to stay by me because they were always so afraid that I would say the wrong thing because if I did, I mean, everyone in that convent would have been exposed.</span> <span id="s128">There might have been other Jewish children in the convent, but, of course, I was not aware of it because I was always by myself.</span> <span id="s129">I did know that these children did come.</span> <span id="s130">.</span> <span id="s131">uh.</span> <span id="s132">.</span> <span id="s133">in the morning.</span> <span id="s134">They did leave at night and I was left.</span> <span id="s135">The minute that they left the nun would actually take me with her and I would go and, uh, to the chapel and again we would go through the religious.</span> <span id="s136">.</span> <span id="s137">the religious end of it so that I would know catholicism backwards and forwards and this was the main training that I got.</span> <span id="s138">The actual schooling part of it was not because I could never stay long enough in a classroom to pick anything up, but the religious aspect, because religion was going to save my life basically.</span> <span id="s139">I mean, this was obviously what they, you know, tried to do.</span> <span id="s140">And, uh, in case the Germans did come.</span> <span id="s141">.</span> <span id="s142">and a lot of times, Germans did come over.</span> <span id="s143">I remember seeing them come into the convent and be talking to the Mother Superior.</span> <span id="s144">So, this is really what, you know, day-to-day life was like.</span> <span id="s145">Uh, once in a while we went out and, you know, walked around some of the gardens and so forth, but I would say basically I was, you know, indoors and really kept busy religiously.</span> <span id="s146">That was the main thing that I really understand catholicism more than anything and, uh, the...of course, the incentive always was the more I knew about it, and I would get another medal.</span> <span id="s147">I mean by the time I left the convent, I had a safety pin that was...had so many medals on it.</span> <span id="s148">It was wonderful.</span> <span id="s149">(laughter) I thought that was great.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">So, you know, it was a great incentive to me to keep going and I did that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: You mentioned one nun that was sort of assigned to you.</span> <span id="s152">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: Can you recall something about her?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: I just recall what she looked like.</span> <span id="s155">She was a very tall, very masculine type of a woman.</span> <span id="s156">She never smiled, and I always...I was scared silly of her.</span> <span id="s157">That I will tell you.</span> <span id="s158">I felt I was...Well, now I feel I was probably, you know, quite a burden on her.</span> <span id="s159">But I was really really afraid of her and I think what scared me the most was at night when she...she would just take me over to this little cubicle and she'd say, "Now get down on your knees and let me hear your prayers.”</span> <span id="s160">And then she would just turn around and leave and then all the lights were shut off, and I was left completely in the dark there.</span> <span id="s161">And that...that really scared me.</span> <span id="s162">That I found very scary.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: How long were you in the convent?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: I believe I was in the convent for almost 2 years because periodically, uh, I..</span> <span id="s165">.</span> <span id="s166">after the convent, I went...I remember when I had to leave the convent which happened one day....came very sudden.</span> <span id="s167">.</span> <span id="s168">uh.</span> <span id="s169">.</span> <span id="s170">that a strange person picked me up and they told me that I would have to leave, that this was not a good place for me anymore.</span> <span id="s171">What I found out later on was, of course, the Germans became aware that the nuns were hiding.</span> <span id="s172">.</span> <span id="s173">uh.</span> <span id="s174">.</span> <span id="s175">Jewish children and their safety was becoming a problem, so they felt that they couldn't jeopardize their whole...the whole school system and so forth.</span> <span id="s176">And they had.</span> <span id="s177">.</span> <span id="s178">they just had a get me so they contacted the underground which.</span> <span id="s179">.</span> <span id="s180">uh.</span> <span id="s181">.</span> <span id="s182">worked with the priests and they felt that I just have to leave, and I just left there.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: Did you see your mother before you left the convent?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s185">I did.</span> <span id="s186">I saw her once, uh, for like a day.</span> <span id="s187">I never stayed overnight.</span> <span id="s188">I was never able to stay with her.</span> <span id="s189">I just saw her for like a day and then I had to leave right away again.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: Where was she?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: My mother was still living in.</span> <span id="s192">.</span> <span id="s193">at home with this Mrs. Degelas and her whole family.</span> <span id="s194">The only thing that had happened there was that her parents were very ill.</span> <span id="s195">And my grandfather took my grandmother to a doctor.</span> <span id="s196">And while my grandmother was inside with the doctor, the Gestapo picked him up on the street; because he was a very, uh...he was a real orthodox Jew and he had a beard and everything.</span> <span id="s197">And they...they just picked him up, and he was never to be seen from or heard from again.</span> <span id="s198">And the doctor somehow got my grandmother....</span> <span id="s199">I don't know how this happened, but somehow got my grandmother.</span> <span id="s200">.</span> <span id="s201">uh.</span> <span id="s202">.</span> <span id="s203">someplace.</span> <span id="s204">And uh...but that was the end of my grandfather.</span> <span id="s205">That was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: Now this person came to get you from the convent.</span> <span id="s207">What are your recollections after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: Well, after they came and got me from the convent I went to, uh, out in the countryside and I was taken to a farm which was...which was wonderful.</span> <span id="s209">I just loved the farm because I was with a private family who had a daughter who was, I would say, about 3 or 4 years older than I and, uh, they had the grandmother live there and this was really... My fondest recollections, you know, of the war was really the happiest there, was just a big farm, and it was just really wonderful except that now I became a Protestant.</span> <span id="s210">They told me I was no longer a Catholic.</span> <span id="s211">So now I was taught how to be a Protestant.</span> <span id="s212">Uh, This...this was fine.</span> <span id="s213">I mean, it didn't matter.</span> <span id="s214">I mean that...it didn't matter.</span> <span id="s215">It was just another learning experience, I guess, you know, learning something.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: What did you have to learn in terms of becoming a Protestant and how did that make you feel?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: Well, they...they took away some of the metals and...they took away the rosary.</span> <span id="s218">That's the first thing they did.</span> <span id="s219">They took away the rosary beads, and.</span> <span id="s220">.</span> <span id="s221">uh.</span> <span id="s222">.</span> <span id="s223">I was not too happy to let go of that.</span> <span id="s224">Uh, but they told me I had to do it.</span> <span id="s225">So I just, you know, I just did it.</span> <span id="s226">You just don't ask questions.</span> <span id="s227">You do what you're told.</span> <span id="s228">And I wanted to stay there so bad.</span> <span id="s229">I really wanted to stay that I would have done anything there just because I was really really happy living on the farm, but unfortunately that was my shortest stay.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: Can you tell me the name of the family?</span> <span id="s231">Did you keep your same name?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: I kept my Susanne Ledon, which was my name all during the war.</span> <span id="s233">Uh, I do not remember their last names.</span> <span id="s234">Their daughter's name was Jeanine.</span> <span id="s235">That I do know, and, uh, that was about, you know, all I could really remember from that that except it was a great...it was just happy there, but I didn't stay very long.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: What happened after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: After that, uh, I think the most...I think the most traumatic thing that happened there was that I was woken up in the middle of the night and.</span> <span id="s238">.</span> <span id="s239">uh.</span> <span id="s240">.</span> <span id="s241">it was rather frightening and a strange man came and Jeanine's mother said, "You have to get dressed now because you have to go with this man.”</span> <span id="s242">And I do remember I was very, very upset about that.</span> <span id="s243">I didn't want to go, but she gave my suitcase or whatever and she told me that I had to leave and she hoped that she'd see me again someday, but I must be good.</span> <span id="s244">That I remember her saying to me.</span> <span id="s245">And, uh, we took around midnight a long train ride, and I remember getting to a home then.</span> <span id="s246">It was like a very large house, and there were lots and lots of children, and he took me to an orphanage.</span> <span id="s247">And, uh, I would say there were about 300 of us in the orphanage and I know there were a couple of adults taking care of us, and we ranged from about the age of 4 to about 18.</span> <span id="s248">That's where the older took care of the younger, and the only good part of it was that I was able to remain a Protestant there.</span> <span id="s249">I didn't have to learn another religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">They...However, we had... I do remember one thing though that I had outgrown all my shoes and, uh, I remembered that.</span> <span id="s251">After I..</span> <span id="s252">.</span> <span id="s253">well, this was at the farm already, I only wore wooden shoes.</span> <span id="s254">I do remember that distinctly and, uh, that...I don't know why that made an impression on me.</span> <span id="s255">But.</span> <span id="s256">.</span> <span id="s257">uh.</span> <span id="s258">that's what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: Can you tell me about your day-to-day life?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: Uh, day-to-day life was really...we lived...there were, I would say, maybe about 10 to 15 rooms there.</span> <span id="s261">We crowded into any room where we found a space, but most of the living was done underground.</span> <span id="s262">Because there were loads and loads of tunnels, uh, underneath, and.</span> <span id="s263">.</span> <span id="s264">uh.</span> <span id="s265">.</span> <span id="s266">we were shown how when air raids came, .</span> <span id="s267">.</span> <span id="s268">uh.</span> <span id="s269">.</span> <span id="s270">how to survive on our own, what we had to do, what kind of procedures because we really had to know how.</span> <span id="s271">.</span> <span id="s272">how to do this alone because nobody could really do it for us.</span> <span id="s273">Like I said, there were only 2 adults there with us.</span> <span id="s274">Food was extremely, extremely scarce.</span> <span id="s275">If you had a slice of bread a day, that was wonderful.</span> <span id="s276">You sort of hoarded it to last, you know, for the whole day.</span> <span id="s277">Uh, you really...it was really a survival of the fittest there.</span> <span id="s278">Whatever you did, that's how you survived.</span> <span id="s279">I remember getting very ill, and you just...well, you just.</span> <span id="s280">.</span> <span id="s281">you just got better.</span> <span id="s282">I mean that was it.</span> <span id="s283">I remember getting caught outside in an air raid.</span> <span id="s284">I wasn't room enough to get...there wasn't...I wasn't fast enough to get in the shelter, because in order to go into the underground shelter you had to go out of the house and go in there, go into the shelter.</span> <span id="s285">And most of the time it was always very, very dark because directly across the street from us were German headquarters and we didn't want to arouse too much suspicion.</span> <span id="s286">I mean they knew this was an orphanage, but I am sure that they never thought there would be Jewish children hidden right under their noses.</span> <span id="s287">Uh.</span> <span id="s288">.</span> <span id="s289">I don't know if all of us were Jewish though or not.</span> <span id="s290">There was very little...there was no communication amongst any of us.</span> <span id="s291">I mean there was no play time.</span> <span id="s292">There was none of that.</span> <span id="s293">It was just you live from hour to hour.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: What did you know of the people who ran the orphanage?</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: Nothing.</span> <span id="s296">I really knew absolutely nothing about them.</span> <span id="s297">They were two women, and that was it.</span> <span id="s298">And...like I said the olders...the older children would take care of the younger ones.</span> <span id="s299">But, uh, we just...you know, we just went along.</span> <span id="s300">I mean, we did...the only thing that we really did do is go to church a lot.</span> <span id="s301">That we did do.</span> <span id="s302">But, uh, otherwise there was...there was really, you know, nothing to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: Was there any contact with your mother during this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: Just once.</span> <span id="s305">There was one more contact with my mother where I did see her for a day and then I went right back again and I could not, you know... Of course, I didn't know the name of the place where I was.</span> <span id="s306">I was told nothing.</span> <span id="s307">I didn't even know the town I was in.</span> <span id="s308">I was told absolutely nothing so that then I was not able to repeat to her anything.</span> <span id="s309">That I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">And, uh, uh, you know, she...I..</span> <span id="s311">.</span> <span id="s312">I do remember her sort of very upset because she thought...I..</span> <span id="s313">.</span> <span id="s314">I remember she thought I didn't look very clean and I, uh, I had.</span> <span id="s315">.</span> <span id="s316">I had scabs all over my head because we all had lice.</span> <span id="s317">We were all pretty sick in that place, but we all...we all managed.</span> <span id="s318">(laughter) That was, you know, in the orphanage.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: Did you have any contact with the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: No.</span> <span id="s321">None whatsoever.</span> <span id="s322">We...you know, we would see them and, uh, come across the street because that's where the lights all were, but we had absolutely no contact with them.</span> <span id="s323">None.</span> <span id="s324">They would walk by periodically.</span> <span id="s325">I mean, they were just like a few yards away.</span> <span id="s326">Sometimes they would walk by but it, they'd never meant anything.</span> <span id="s327">I don't know if they ever came into the orphanage.</span> <span id="s328">I never saw them.</span> <span id="s329">They might have gone and spoken to the 2 adults, but otherwise that was the only contact I recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: How long were you in the orphanage?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: I was in the orphanage til the war ended in.</span> <span id="s332">.</span> <span id="s333">in 45.</span> <span id="s334">I can't really, really say how many years, you know, that was.</span> <span id="s335">I really can't.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: How did you feel during that time?</span> <span id="s337">What were your personal feelings?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: Uh, I don't know how I..</span> <span id="s339">.</span> <span id="s340">You know I can't really say how I felt because, uh, I was basically, you know, a loner.</span> <span id="s341">Uh, that I do remember.</span> <span id="s342">I stayed by myself considerably.</span> <span id="s343">Uh.</span> <span id="s344">.</span> <span id="s345">I remember from...this is from when I was a Catholic that Saint Susanne Day was going to come up, and I did tell the... one of the ladies that ran the place that that was Saints Day and on Saints Day that everybody usually got a gift.</span> <span id="s346">That's when you were a Catholic.</span> <span id="s347">(Laugh) So I remember them saying, "Well.</span> <span id="s348">Fine.”</span> <span id="s349">And I remember that they got me.</span> <span id="s350">.</span> <span id="s351">uh.</span> <span id="s352">.</span> <span id="s353">like cookies.</span> <span id="s354">They got me like 5 cookies.</span> <span id="s355">I'll never forget it.</span> <span id="s356">And those...I remember making those cookies last for about a month.</span> <span id="s357">I would take one bite a day in order for them to last.</span> <span id="s358">And I thought that was the greatest thing that ever happen to me in that orphanage, and.</span> <span id="s359">.</span> <span id="s360">uh.</span> <span id="s361">.</span> <span id="s362">that I had a Saints Day so that's the only really positive thing that I remember, I think, from the orphanage.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: You mentioned something about an underground system of tunnels.</span> <span id="s364">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: Can you tell us a little bit about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: Well, the.</span> <span id="s367">.</span> <span id="s368">the underground system, it was like, uh...they were like dirt walls and dirt floors and I know they had beams on the side and.</span> <span id="s369">.</span> <span id="s370">uh.</span> <span id="s371">.</span> <span id="s372">the two ladies that were in charge there, they had like a lantern and when the air raids would come.</span> <span id="s373">.</span> <span id="s374">they.</span> <span id="s375">.</span> <span id="s376">they would take the lanterns and go down there, and we would just lay down anywhere until the raids were over.</span> <span id="s377">I mean some of us just stayed there, and some of us went back afterwards, but I do recall one day having...not getting down there fast enough, and I was caught out on the.</span> <span id="s378">.</span> <span id="s379">out between the house and the underground passage and I remember seeing the planes and the bombing planes.</span> <span id="s380">And I threw myself down on the ground and I looked up and I thought, "This isn't so terrible," and it was like paper streamers coming down.</span> <span id="s381">It looked like tin foil.</span> <span id="s382">Streams of tin foil coming down.</span> <span id="s383">And I thought, "Gee, this is great.”</span> <span id="s384">And, you now, it certainly beat being in the darkness and, uh, I don't think that was so terrible and I didn't know what I had to go underground.</span> <span id="s385">That I remember.</span> <span id="s386">And I do remember when this landed on the field, I was playing with the a..</span> <span id="s387">.</span> <span id="s388">with the tin foil.</span> <span id="s389">It looked like tin foil now that I think about it.</span> <span id="s390">They were just streamers.</span> <span id="s391">I don't know what that...you know, what that was.</span> <span id="s392">And it was just coming down, but.</span> <span id="s393">.</span> <span id="s394">uh.</span> <span id="s395">.</span> <span id="s396">I do remember seeing the air raids right up above me and watching.</span> <span id="s397">The only thing that did frighten me was the noises, the bombing.</span> <span id="s398">That really used to frighten me terribly and, uh.</span> <span id="s399">.</span> <span id="s400">I think that's why I am afraid of thunder up til this day frankly But.</span> <span id="s401">.</span> <span id="s402">uh.</span> <span id="s403">.</span> <span id="s404">that was one of the things I remember the most.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: Did you have an understanding or what was your understanding of what the war was about?</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: No.</span> <span id="s407">I don't think I did.</span> <span id="s408">I felt that this is the way things were, and this is...this is it.</span> <span id="s409">I mean, I think the only thing that bothered me, now that I think about it, is that I..</span> <span id="s410">.</span> <span id="s411">I wish I had some of the things that my mother used to give away and if I had what my mother used to give away, maybe I could have some food.</span> <span id="s412">That was the only thing that really bothered me.</span> <span id="s413">Uh, I do remember picking berries though,...uh.</span> <span id="s414">.</span> <span id="s415">finding fields that had berries, and eating berries.</span> <span id="s416">I think just the hunger part of it bothered me.</span> <span id="s417">Sometimes I was very cold.</span> <span id="s418">That I got over for some reason.</span> <span id="s419">The hunger I think was the worst part of it.</span> <span id="s420">Really!</span> <span id="s421">But I felt, you know...I never...this was the way life was.</span> <span id="s422">I mean there was just no other way, so you just...you just go along and.</span> <span id="s423">.</span> <span id="s424">it didn't.</span> <span id="s425">.</span> <span id="s426">There was really no real association with my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: What were the facilities like at the orphanage.</span> <span id="s428">Did you sleep in a room?</span> <span id="s429">Did you sleep in a bed?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: Uh, the facilities in the orphanage were, like I said, they were bad.</span> <span id="s431">Everywhere from 10 to 15 rooms and we would all crowd into these rooms.</span> <span id="s432">Uh, there were some blankets thrown around.</span> <span id="s433">They were maybe 2 or 3 beds.</span> <span id="s434">Whoever got to them first got to them or we'd sleep on the floor.</span> <span id="s435">Uh, it was like you did for yourself wherever you could.</span> <span id="s436">There was nothing...it's whoever came first.</span> <span id="s437">I mean, that's how it was.</span> <span id="s438">Bathrooms, I think maybe there were two bathrooms, not that it really mattered.</span> <span id="s439">I mean it was, you know I mean, sanitary conditions were just terrible, absolutely terrible.</span> <span id="s440">But, uh, I think...I really feel that most of us stayed by ourselves.</span> <span id="s441">We really did not interact too much with each other.</span> <span id="s442">We just didn't.</span> <span id="s443">Uh, we all spoke French and...uh... Flemish, uh...but there was not a lot of communication.</span> <span id="s444">There really wasn't.</span> <span id="s445">There was really...you knew you had to survive on your own from day to day and you just had that...you just had that instinct.</span> <span id="s446">.</span> <span id="s447">that's...you just have to do it.</span> <span id="s448">That's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: What do you remember about liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: Well, I remember about liberation was where German headquarters were, we were liberated by, uh, by the Americans and I remember that the American soldiers when they knew there was an orphanage, they came.</span> <span id="s451">Oh, they came over bearing, you know, food, which was the most wonderful gift of all.</span> <span id="s452">They would bring chocolates and candy bars and little cookies in packages and that was really, really, you know.</span> <span id="s453">That was wonderful.</span> <span id="s454">I think we always used to look forward to it.</span> <span id="s455">The soldiers used to come and visit us.</span> <span id="s456">You know, every day and we...it did mean getting food, which was, you know, really great.</span> <span id="s457">So that was I think the main recollection that I have of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: And what happened after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: Well, after that, I, uh, or I should say this... One American soldier, he really got very, very friendly with me.</span> <span id="s460">And he would bring me things.</span> <span id="s461">He would come every day to see me and every day he had some.</span> <span id="s462">.</span> <span id="s463">uh...some...either chocolate or just some food.</span> <span id="s464">And he would spend some time with me, and it eventually got to the point where he wanted to adopt me.</span> <span id="s465">And, of course, I didn't know what it meant except that, you know, it meant having somebody that cared for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: And then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: Well, then what happened was that.</span> <span id="s468">.</span> <span id="s469">uh.</span> <span id="s470">.</span> <span id="s471">I guess he went ahead with this, with the fact that he wanted to adopt me, but in order to get the proper clearance and everything he had to check out some of my background and he had to give all this to the Red Cross which in turn had to get a hold of the underground and they had to start doing a lot of tracing, uh, back to, uh, exactly where am I coming from, what kind of family.</span> <span id="s472">Is there anyone that has survived?</span> <span id="s473">So the procedure took really a very, very long time, and then...uh...while this was going on, one of my mother's brothers who had been living in the United States.</span> <span id="s474">.</span> <span id="s475">un.</span> <span id="s476">.</span> <span id="s477">since right before he war, he was also in the Army, and.</span> <span id="s478">.</span> <span id="s479">uh.</span> <span id="s480">.</span> <span id="s481">the Red Cross was able to.</span> <span id="s482">.</span> <span id="s483">uh.</span> <span id="s484">.</span> <span id="s485">find him and he made contact with this Jack and.</span> <span id="s486">.</span> <span id="s487">uh.</span> <span id="s488">.</span> <span id="s489">they found out that I had a father living in the United States and Jack said to me that he couldn't adopt me and that was...that was terrible.</span> <span id="s490">That was very upsetting because my mother at that point had not come back from Auschwitz yet.</span> <span id="s491">So, but I was very upset about that.</span> <span id="s492">I..</span> <span id="s493">.</span> <span id="s494">I remember that.</span> <span id="s495">And, uh, he tried to explain that I had other family, my father was in the United States and they would find him, and all that.</span> <span id="s496">So that's really what happened and then in the interim, my mother appeared who had once she was...after she was liberated from Auschwitz, she was in a hospital because she had typhoid.</span> <span id="s497">She was sick for quite a while, but the minute she was better, she was able to get a hold of the underground, and the underground told her where I was in this orphanage.</span> <span id="s498">And, uh, then my mother came and, uh, you know, this was again somebody new in my life.</span> <span id="s499">So.</span> <span id="s500">.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: Did you mother ever tell you when she was taken to Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: Uh, Yes.</span> <span id="s503">Uh, she did.</span> <span id="s504">She.</span> <span id="s505">.</span> <span id="s506">it seemed that after my last visit...the last time I had seen her when I was in the orphanage, she...the whole family, uh, was taken to, uh, to concentration camp and, uh, they were all exterminated except her.</span> <span id="s507">And, uh, they felt she was young enough to work in the ammunitions factory and, uh, what happened...the other thing that happened with her was, uh, she was.</span> <span id="s508">.</span> <span id="s509">uh.</span> <span id="s510">.</span> <span id="s511">ready to go into the gas chamber which, of course, she didn't know was the gas chamber, and.</span> <span id="s512">.</span> <span id="s513">uh.</span> <span id="s514">.</span> <span id="s515">there was a soldier that was standing in the line to get her to go in.</span> <span id="s516">And he walked over to her and he tapped her on the shoulder, and he said, "I know you.”</span> <span id="s517">And it turned out this SS man had gone to school with her in Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">And he said, "I know how old you are.”</span> <span id="s519">He said, "You can go and work in the ammunitions factory.”</span> <span id="s520">And that's...that is how my mother was saved, because he had recognized her.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: What do you remember about your reunion with your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: Uh, what do I remember?</span> <span id="s523">I don't...I had...I had very mixed emotions about it, because I was very, very upset that I wasn't going to go with Jack.</span> <span id="s524">Because, like I said, Jack visited me every day and he was very good to me.</span> <span id="s525">And now another strange person comes into my life.</span> <span id="s526">Of course, I had been separated from my mother so long that, uh, you know, Mother didn't mean anything to me.</span> <span id="s527">And, uh, (crying) I think it was just...it was just a strange woman who came.</span> <span id="s528">I mean, I vaguely remembered her.</span> <span id="s529">(Crying, crying, crying) Uh, I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s530">There goes the mascara.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: You're okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: I didn't mean to do this.</span> <span id="s533">Uh, well, like I said, it was a strange person who appears in my life again and, uh, you know after Jack, I though, which was so wonderful, you know, for the time that it lasted.</span> <span id="s534">And she, of course, wanted me, you know, to leave the orphanage which the, uh, which I told her I could do and, uh, there were these Jewish organizations.</span> <span id="s535">.</span> <span id="s536">uh.</span> <span id="s537">.</span> <span id="s538">overseas also affiliated.</span> <span id="s539">.</span> <span id="s540">uh.</span> <span id="s541">.</span> <span id="s542">with the...with the underground that made certain provisions, gave you, you know, some money and they found a place for you to live, and.</span> <span id="s543">.</span> <span id="s544">uh.</span> <span id="s545">.</span> <span id="s546">I did go with her, of course.</span> <span id="s547">And, uh, she, you know, proceeded on, of course, getting me healthy because I was just infested, absolutely infested with lice and I had to have all my head, my whole head shaved off, and I was.</span> <span id="s548">.</span> <span id="s549">I was really quite sick afterwards but I got over it.</span> <span id="s550">And, uh, with the underground, you know, helping out, uh, because they had doctors look us over and things like that and they provided.</span> <span id="s551">.</span> <span id="s552">uh.</span> <span id="s553">.</span> <span id="s554">a living, a room for us that.</span> <span id="s555">.</span> <span id="s556">uh.</span> <span id="s557">.</span> <span id="s558">we lived in.</span> <span id="s559">And, uh, I, of course, at that point I remembered very, very little German and she spoke no French at all so I had a start learning how to speak German with her because it was very difficult communicating with her.</span> <span id="s560">And, uh, we...you know, we started...she got a hold of my uncle through the Red Cross and got a hold...who got a hold...and then got a hold of my father and, uh, with that point had to start saving up some money in order for us to come to the United States because you had to prove that you...there was somebody here in the States that could take care of you.</span> <span id="s561">But not only that you had the Austrian quota that we had to wait for which was not the best quota.</span> <span id="s562">And, in the interim,.</span> <span id="s563">.</span> <span id="s564">uh.</span> <span id="s565">.</span> <span id="s566">my mother, after she more or less got me back into a healthy state, she tried to send me to school, but it was extremely, extremely difficult for me because here I was learning German, I was one day I am going to one school, and then the underground would move us again to different quarters and I would go to another school so it really amounted to, as far as education, to nothing, to be very honest with you.</span> <span id="s567">I never learned anything.</span> <span id="s568">And, uh, I..</span> <span id="s569">.</span> <span id="s570">My mother would pick up these books from the underground.</span> <span id="s571">They were written in French and, uh, I taught myself really how to read and how to write French and Flemish because those were the two languages that were spoken, uh, predominantly in Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">And.</span> <span id="s573">.</span> <span id="s574">uh.</span> <span id="s575">.</span> <span id="s576">German, of course, I got from my mother and I always knew how to speak Yiddish because of my grandparents so that I found the German rather easy to come by so at least we were able to have some form of a..</span> <span id="s577">.</span> <span id="s578">of communication going.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: What was your relationship with your mother like during these years?</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: It was very estranged.</span> <span id="s581">Uh, this was just another person coming into my life, and, uh, it (pause)...and I am sure it was very difficult for her because here's this woman who has just gone through all this and now she's got this child to take care of.</span> <span id="s582">Uh...It was a very estranged.</span> <span id="s583">.</span> <span id="s584">uh.</span> <span id="s585">.</span> <span id="s586">relationship.</span> <span id="s587">Not that she didn't love me, I know she did.</span> <span id="s588">But it was just very different.</span> <span id="s589">I think because, you know there was a lot of lack of communication, and from...first of all, I wasn't used to anybody really ever taking care of me.</span> <span id="s590">I was moved here and moved there, and I was just...I was almost like I was waiting for when am I going to leave here kind of thing.</span> <span id="s591">You really do.</span> <span id="s592">You're always...nothing ever seems permanent so I really was waiting to leave again because I understood from the war what I could understand.</span> <span id="s593">I mean, war was war and that's what life was.</span> <span id="s594">War!</span> <span id="s595">It...When, you know, when they said, Liberation.</span> <span id="s596">The war is over.</span> <span id="s597">You can do this.</span> <span id="s598">You can do that.</span> <span id="s599">Well, it didn't...it really didn't mean anything t me.</span> <span id="s600">It really didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: What was your day to day life like at this point?</span> <span id="s602">Was your mother working?</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: No.</span> <span id="s604">My mother...my mother could not work, uh, because she was...her health was not that good.</span> <span id="s605">Uh, day to day life,.</span> <span id="s606">.</span> <span id="s607">Well, I remember I once found a kitten on the street and I picked it up.</span> <span id="s608">I do remember that.</span> <span id="s609">And I brought it home and, uh, that didn't last very long, unfortunately.</span> <span id="s610">I..</span> <span id="s611">.</span> <span id="s612">I do...I remember taking a, uh, having a ...box of some kind and, uh, I remember trying...I wanted the kitten to go to sleep and the kitten wouldn't go to sleep.</span> <span id="s613">And I remember I picked it up and I threw it out the window.</span> <span id="s614">I remember doing that which...I don't why I did that, but I did.</span> <span id="s615">It wouldn't do what I told it to, and it was like almost, you know, I had to...you had to do what you were told.</span> <span id="s616">And I don't know why that left an impression on me.</span> <span id="s617">Uh, I remember helping my mother scrub floors and we had a little pot bellied stove that we had to fill everyday with brickets in order to get warmth into the room.</span> <span id="s618">I remember that.</span> <span id="s619">And I remember one winter it getting so so cold and my mother washing the floor with a knit rag.</span> <span id="s620">And I remember one day she put water on this little stove and she started washing the rag out in it and I said to her why was she doing that, and she told me she was going to make me a beautiful sweater.</span> <span id="s621">And I remember taking a rag with her and helping her unwind the yarn and I don't know where, but she got some knitting needles, and she showed me how to start knitting and out of the floor rag, I got a sweater.</span> <span id="s622">I do remember that.</span> <span id="s623">(laugh) And, uh, I think that was sort of the highlight of my (laugh) my togetherness with my mother.</span> <span id="s624">Uh, I also remember, you know, I was able to go for walks and I was able to go out alone on the streets.</span> <span id="s625">That I thought was really great.</span> <span id="s626">And I remember during the day leaving my mother... by myself and I would go to the downtown area of Brussels and,uh, they would have like...like shows, I guess you could call like variety shows here.</span> <span id="s627">And I remember standing by the door there after everybody got in and I would sort of sneak into the variety shows without, without telling my mother and without paying.</span> <span id="s628">I do remember that.</span> <span id="s629">And that was wonderful.</span> <span id="s630">And, uh, that...those were really the...the best parts, just that I was able to go out by myself.</span> <span id="s631">I also remember, uh, going to the market places and we really could not afford anything because we were really rationed money-wise that the underground would give us.</span> <span id="s632">And I remember picking up dead flowers and, oh, I would pray so hard that they would come to life at night.</span> <span id="s633">Uh, and that I did every day.</span> <span id="s634">That I would...I would do that every day after the market would close up around 5, 6 o'clock.</span> <span id="s635">I would run down there real fast and hope that some of the flowers were left on the ground.</span> <span id="s636">I remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Q: At what point did you start planning to immigrate to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: Well, my mother kept.</span> <span id="s639">.</span> <span id="s640">uh.</span> <span id="s641">.</span> <span id="s642">getting news as to how our quota stood and, uh, then finally, I was almost 13.</span> <span id="s643">I was just about 13 that the...it looked rather promising that we would be able to come and, uh, I remember my mother saying that we would have to go to Sweden and we were going to get on a boat and we were going to come to the United States.</span> <span id="s644">And, uh, at first I thought I was coming...I was going alone again because this is how I was used to doing things.</span> <span id="s645">But she said no, she was going to go with me.</span> <span id="s646">And.</span> <span id="s647">.</span> <span id="s648">uh.</span> <span id="s649">.</span> <span id="s650">but that's...I feel that's one.</span> <span id="s651">.</span> <span id="s652">you know, it really started like around, I think it was like around 1948 or 49, around that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: Can you tell me a little bit about coming to America?</span> <span id="s654">How you traveled and what that was like?</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: Well, we...I remember we left...we left Belgium and we...we took a train and I remember the people from the underground, they gave us some food and they gave us some clothing to take with us and, of course, we had to have a passport and I do remember the train ride because we were taking the ship from our Göteborg, Sweden.</span> <span id="s656">And the train ride was, I remember, rather long and extensive.</span> <span id="s657">I also remember that at the border, when we got to the German border, we had to do a pass check.</span> <span id="s658">The passports are checked and at that point, some...of course, they were German people...they were not the German soldiers anymore, that they boarded the train and my mother got very scared.</span> <span id="s659">I do remember that.</span> <span id="s660">And at that point she started pointing out all the terrible things about the Germans and she also, uh, showed me some of the...the children that were out on the platform of the station and they really looked raggedy and sort of worn out.</span> <span id="s661">And I remember having a candy bar, something in my hand, and the windows on the train, they open half way cause there're the European trains where you sit in compartments.</span> <span id="s662">And then there's like a long hall and I was holding this candy bar and I was eating it or something and I pointed part of it out the window, and I remember my mother slapping me.</span> <span id="s663">I do remember that.</span> <span id="s664">And she said, "Don't you ever, ever give anything to those Germans.”</span> <span id="s665">And, oh, I remember that so distinctly.</span> <span id="s666">She got so upset with me because I had the candy bar and I was willing to give them some.</span> <span id="s667">But, you know, it wasn't until years later of course...I got upset at that point, but years later I understood and believe me, I understand (laugh).</span> <span id="s668">But from there, then we went to Sweden and we boarded.</span> <span id="s669">.</span> <span id="s670">we boarded a ship and we were all the way...I guess it's like almost in the hull of the ship, and.</span> <span id="s671">.</span> <span id="s672">uh.</span> <span id="s673">.</span> <span id="s674">we were just all thrown in there.</span> <span id="s675">I mean there was so many of us and long, long passage.</span> <span id="s676">(crying)</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: We are going to take a break now.</span> <span id="s678">We are going to change tapes.</span> <span id="s679">Perfect timing.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">TAPE #2</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: I don't mean to...to get upset with this.</span> <span id="s682">I really... Q: What happened when you got to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: Well, uh, when I got to America, uh, we landed at Ellis Island, New York and there was a lot of commotion.</span> <span id="s684">My mother's brother was there.</span> <span id="s685">And they...he then took us to...to meet his wife; and I remember we did stay in New York... Oh, I think it was like about a couple of days.</span> <span id="s686">Uh, we did not reunited with my father immediately because he was in Connecticut; and for some reason, he just...you know, he just couldn't get to us right away.</span> <span id="s687">Uh, however, when I did meet with my father, uh, it...it was not what I would call a very great reunion.</span> <span id="s688">Not on my part, anyways, because I think I resented him immediately.</span> <span id="s689">Because here was somebody who was going to come and take my mother away.</span> <span id="s690">And I had my mother now for a little bit; and, of course, this was a stranger in my life.</span> <span id="s691">So it was...I found it very, very difficult.</span> <span id="s692">Extremely difficult.</span> <span id="s693">Uh, we moved to Connecticut.</span> <span id="s694">And now when I think about it, I think that my life was easier in Europe than it ever would have been in the United States; because the turmoil here was just incredible.</span> <span id="s695">I can't even describe it.</span> <span id="s696">That's how...how traumatic this was there.</span> <span id="s697">Uh, I found there I had just those finding my little niches.</span> <span id="s698">I was going in Europe; that is...running about, doing my own little thing, and now I come to this country again.</span> <span id="s699">I cannot speak a word of English.</span> <span id="s700">My father speaks, uh, some German.</span> <span id="s701">He's not very fluent in it, but enough to communicate with my mother.</span> <span id="s702">He was a very poor man.</span> <span id="s703">Uh, we moved to a very small community.</span> <span id="s704">And by small, I mean a small Jewish community; but there were only like 30 families living there.</span> <span id="s705">However, they're all very, very affluent.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">We're living on the...shall we say, wrong side of the track, and in an old apartment house.</span> <span id="s707">I have to go to school; but my father decides that I have to go to a Yeshiva.</span> <span id="s708">And I think at this point, I really was very rebellious against the Yeshiva.</span> <span id="s709">I really feel I was very sick and tired of learning all these religions, because all my mother had done right now was, since the war over, she told me I was Jewish and that was it.</span> <span id="s710">But I didn't really know anything about Judaism.</span> <span id="s711">She tried to explain to me persecution is because we were Jews, which... Well, that was...that's all right.</span> <span id="s712">I mean, this is all I understood anyway.</span> <span id="s713">So it didn't really make any difference.</span> <span id="s714">But my father decided I definitely had to go to a Yeshiva.</span> <span id="s715">And I went to the Yeshiva, and I lasted 6 weeks.</span> <span id="s716">Uh, first of all, it meant learning another language, which was Hebrew.</span> <span id="s717">I could not...I had a terrible time with that...terrible time; and, uh, I couldn't understand the English part of it either.</span> <span id="s718">So I was ever...I was just nowhere.</span> <span id="s719">Learning another language, and not understanding the language I am supposed to speak.</span> <span id="s720">And nobody could converse with me.</span> <span id="s721">I did speak Yiddish, though, to the Rabbi.</span> <span id="s722">That was about it.</span> <span id="s723">But I didn't last.</span> <span id="s724">I just...I really carried on until they finally...so my father finally took me out of there.</span> <span id="s725">So that immediately started even more resentment toward him.</span> <span id="s726">And, uh, from there on, they decided I better go to a public school.</span> <span id="s727">However, seeing that I was twelve and a half years old, I had to be BarMitzvah at the age of 13.</span> <span id="s728">So the first thing they did after they took me</span></p> <p><span id="s729">1 NB: Bat.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">out of the Yeshiva was I was enrolled at Sunday school and 3 days a week, I had to go to Hebrew school, which I did, and I had to go to public school.</span> <span id="s731">Public school was a problem because here I am almost 13, and I belong in 8th grade.</span> <span id="s732">They don't know what they're gonna do with me.</span> <span id="s733">They put me into 8th grade.</span> <span id="s734">I don't understand one word, at least...I mean nobody even speaks Yiddish there.</span> <span id="s735">I don't know anything.</span> <span id="s736">I have had no formal education at all.</span> <span id="s737">I have never had a day of math in my life.</span> <span id="s738">I mean I have had zero.</span> <span id="s739">Zero!</span> <span id="s740">Zero!</span> <span id="s741">So, the only good part about it was that I became a novelty in that school, because I could sing the French National Anthem.</span> <span id="s742">I mean, I could do things in French and nobody else did.</span> <span id="s743">(laugh) So they all started paying a lot of attention to me because of it.</span> <span id="s744">But they...that didn't matter.</span> <span id="s745">They didn't know how they were going to do this with me through school.</span> <span id="s746">So they devised a plan that every day I would spend a half hour in first grade, a half hour in second grade, a half hour in third grade.</span> <span id="s747">Well, it was a little humiliating because here I am with these 7 and 8 years and I am almost 13, but there was no other way to get me caught up.</span> <span id="s748">I did do it.</span> <span id="s749">Uh, I didn't do it the first year, but they did get me through 8th grade enough so that I could read enough so that I could write.</span> <span id="s750">Math, I knew the multiplication tables and I could do some addition and some subtraction.</span> <span id="s751">Math is still not my subject (laugh), but I got through.</span> <span id="s752">And I also got Bar [NB: Bat] Mitzvah, because I had to; and I did read the HafTorah in Hebrew, because I had to.</span> <span id="s753">And the other thing is that I wanted to be like the rest of the children.</span> <span id="s754">I was 13 years old.</span> <span id="s755">And it's very, very difficult when you're going into high school to be different; and I wanted to be like the rest of them.</span> <span id="s756">And (sigh), it meant...I remember buying sheet music and standing in front of a mirror and practicing how to lose this accent and I practiced so hard.</span> <span id="s757">I really worked at it.</span> <span id="s758">And I made some friends.</span> <span id="s759">The friends that I did make though were... I would always seek out the ones that scholastically were way up there, because those were the ones I wanted to be like.</span> <span id="s760">And when I went to high school, they only...there were only two courses given.</span> <span id="s761">One was a college level course; and the other one was a business course.</span> <span id="s762">But the kids I wanted to be with were the college level kids.</span> <span id="s763">So I made up my mind I'm going.</span> <span id="s764">I'm going to go to college.</span> <span id="s765">Which it was quite a struggle.</span> <span id="s766">The only thing that I did do was, the...the uh teachers were sympathetic to me and they did work with me for many, many hours.</span> <span id="s767">And like I say, I practiced really, really hard.</span> <span id="s768">I took some courses that were easy for me.</span> <span id="s769">Like I took French, which was wonderful; and I became President of the French class which was (laugh)... That the best thing that happened to me all through high school.</span> <span id="s770">Uh, I did join the choir; and at Christmas time, of course, I could sing all the Christmas carols.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Because in Europe the tunes were the same, only the (laugh) language was different.</span> <span id="s772">But I could sing it in Latin, and they couldn't sing it in Latin.</span> <span id="s773">So, you know, I excelled in that.</span> <span id="s774">Uh, I had a lot of...the kids that...a lot of them that I was friendly with, uh they were...a lot of them were Catholic.</span> <span id="s775">And I would go to confession with them, and I knew what was going on.</span> <span id="s776">So that way, it was great to have had that background in other religions.</span> <span id="s777">I mean, it was really my own religion that I knew the least about.</span> <span id="s778">But I was getting...you know, I was Bar [NB: Bat] Mitzvah anyway, so it didn't matter.</span> <span id="s779">And, uh, but the Jewish families, like I said, they lived on the other side of town.</span> <span id="s780">And this I could not...those are the ones I would have liked to have kept up with, but I just couldn't.</span> <span id="s781">And uh...so I felt the only way to do this was then to uh...to go with the kids that were...did excel in school.</span> <span id="s782">The ones that were the cheerleaders and things like that.</span> <span id="s783">And uh... As a matter of fact, in 8th grade, I remember they even made me Captain of the cheerleaders, which was a great boost to my morale.</span> <span id="s784">So they did...you know, they did try; but I think one of the most difficult thing is you want to be like your peers.</span> <span id="s785">And it was terrible.</span> <span id="s786">It was really so terrible.</span> <span id="s787">And losing that accent, which I wanted to in the worst way!</span> <span id="s788">Well, I finally did; but with a lot of, a lot of practice.</span> <span id="s789">And I got to my senior year of high school and, of course, I was taking a college bound course.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Which... I mean, they just let me do it.</span> <span id="s791">They didn't know how I was going to achieve that.</span> <span id="s792">And I made up my mind I wanted to go on to college.</span> <span id="s793">And the principal of the high school called me down.</span> <span id="s794">And he said, "You are trying to do the impossible.”</span> <span id="s795">He says, "You'll never...” He says, "You...you just can't do this.”</span> <span id="s796">He says, "You can't go to a..</span> <span id="s797">to a 4 year school.”</span> <span id="s798">And I says, "Well, I'm going to.”</span> <span id="s799">My SATs were disgusting.</span> <span id="s800">They were just terrible.</span> <span id="s801">So I told him I had to go to college.</span> <span id="s802">And he went ahead and he wrote letters to the presidents of the different colleges that I wanted to go to; because I had made up my mind that the first school I wanted to go to was Boston University.</span> <span id="s803">The second one was University of Connecticut.</span> <span id="s804">And as a fallback, I would go to a two year school.</span> <span id="s805">But that was a real fallback.</span> <span id="s806">And (cough) I had in the interim become friendly with one gal who belonged to the Temple with us.... "Well, if she can go to Boston University maybe that's where I'll go.”</span> <span id="s807">I wanted to be so much like the rest of them.</span> <span id="s808">But it was one of the most difficult things to do.</span> <span id="s809">And he did.</span> <span id="s810">He wrote; and they told him that they would consider my coming up and taking an interview, because the written part I couldn't do.</span> <span id="s811">I mean, half the things I was reading, I didn't even know what I was reading because the vocabulary.</span> <span id="s812">I..</span> <span id="s813">.</span> <span id="s814">I just didn't have any vocabulary.</span> <span id="s815">And they all granted me interviews.</span> <span id="s816">And (pause) the...I remember going up to Boston, getting on a bus and going; because my...neither one of my parents ever saw the inside of a school.</span> <span id="s817">I mean, I just went.</span> <span id="s818">I did.</span> <span id="s819">I mean, even when they had meetings and things like that, they couldn't communicate.</span> <span id="s820">Plus they had their own...their own problems.</span> <span id="s821">And I always sort of took care of myself.</span> <span id="s822">And I think they always figured as long as I had a roof over my head and food on the table... I mean, what else did I need?</span> <span id="s823">So I..</span> <span id="s824">.</span> <span id="s825">I really I..</span> <span id="s826">.</span> <span id="s827">you know, I made my own way.</span> <span id="s828">I took a bus.</span> <span id="s829">I went to Boston.</span> <span id="s830">I had my interview, and I remember sitting near begging them, please, to let me in.</span> <span id="s831">Uh, frankly, I think they let me in cause they felt sorry for me.</span> <span id="s832">I really do.</span> <span id="s833">Because I don't know how they could take a chance on this.</span> <span id="s834">Uh, they did.</span> <span id="s835">They...They said to me, "Fine.”</span> <span id="s836">And I was called down by the principal; and the Principal told me I was going to find it extremely difficult, extremely difficult, and they were taking me only on probation.</span> <span id="s837">I said, "Okay.”</span> <span id="s838">That was...that was good enough for me.</span> <span id="s839">And my parents, at that point, when they heard I was going...you know, I was really determined to go.</span> <span id="s840">They...in the 50s, everybody went in to be a school teacher.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">But I didn't want to be a school teacher.</span> <span id="s842">I didn't want that.</span> <span id="s843">(laugh) So...I wanted to be a art major.</span> <span id="s844">So I made a deal with them.</span> <span id="s845">I was going to be an art major for a while, and then I would switch.</span> <span id="s846">Anyways, I went to...went to Boston; and I was an art major my first semester.</span> <span id="s847">And if life was ever difficult, it was when I went to college.</span> <span id="s848">It was like Greek.</span> <span id="s849">It was like learning Greek; 'cause no matter what I picked up, it wasn't where I was going to get that extra help anymore... that I..</span> <span id="s850">.</span> <span id="s851">I mean, you just don't do this.</span> <span id="s852">It was so, so difficult.</span> <span id="s853">And my first semester, my grades were not too good.</span> <span id="s854">And seeing that I was there only on probation, I marched myself over to the Dean's office again.</span> <span id="s855">And I said, "I want to switch my major.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Give me another semester.”</span> <span id="s857">And what I did in the meantime is, this gal from Manchester, she was in liberal arts.</span> <span id="s858">And she also decided she's switching her major.</span> <span id="s859">And I said, "Joyce, how would you like to be roommates?"</span> <span id="s860">Because I needed tutoring so bad.</span> <span id="s861">And she said, "You know, I am switching.”</span> <span id="s862">I said, "What are you switching to?"</span> <span id="s863">And she said, "I am going into education.”</span> <span id="s864">Well, I didn't want an education [major]; but if she was going to education, I'm going to education (laugh) with her.</span> <span id="s865">I said, "Let's be roommates, and I am going to go to education.”</span> <span id="s866">I said, "Let's sign up for all the same courses.”</span> <span id="s867">Which is what she did.</span> <span id="s868">And to make a long story short, by my senior year I made Dean's list.</span> <span id="s869">And Joyce could have two degrees; because what Joyce went through with me, I don't wish on anybody.</span> <span id="s870">She could have had two diplomas.</span> <span id="s871">And if it wasn't for her... But I got through college, and (sigh).</span> <span id="s872">.</span> <span id="s873">Where there's a will, there's a way.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Q: How did this make you feel, and how did this make your family feel?</span></p> <p><span id="s875">A: My family, uh... Well, I mean, they were glad that I did.</span> <span id="s876">I was my own motivation though.</span> <span id="s877">I mean, if I had gotten through, I would gotten through.</span> <span id="s878">If I hadn't gotten through, they would have been extremely upset; but that was it.</span> <span id="s879">I mean, their lives were so affected from the past that.</span> <span id="s880">.</span> <span id="s881">uh... (pause) I was...I was like the offspring of the two, and that was it.</span> <span id="s882">Do you know I am saying?</span> <span id="s883">They had their own lives.</span> <span id="s884">And it's, you know, like I've told my husband.</span> <span id="s885">I tell him these little stories that happened to me periodically.</span> <span id="s886">I mean, one day when I was in high school we had a health class; and the health class, it said you should go see a dentist twice a year.</span> <span id="s887">Well, I had never seen a dentist in my whole life.</span> <span id="s888">So, as I was walking home one day, I saw a plaque outside that said, "DENTIST.”</span> <span id="s889">So I marched myself upstairs and I went to the Dentist.</span> <span id="s890">I mean, I was 16 years old.</span> <span id="s891">This is the first time I have ever been to a dentist.</span> <span id="s892">I came home.</span> <span id="s893">I told my mother I went to a dentist; and she said, "Well, that's good.”</span> <span id="s894">I mean, she didn't even know...she said, "Did you have a tooth ache?"</span> <span id="s895">That's when you went to a dentist.</span> <span id="s896">You know, there these things that you...I think that we take for granted, that just people...</span></p> <p><span id="s897">People just don't do them.</span> <span id="s898">They just don't!</span> <span id="s899">So if you take your own initiative, I think if you're self motivated, you can do just about anything.</span> <span id="s900">But that's really what it takes.</span> <span id="s901">I don't...I don't think there's anything else that can keep you going.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Q; How did you finance college?</span></p> <p><span id="s903">A: Finance college.</span> <span id="s904">Well, when my father heard that I had to go to college... And, uh, he was working in a factory; and uh, of course, college was not terribly expensive then.</span> <span id="s905">I mean, it was $10,000 for 4 years at Boston University.</span> <span id="s906">Now, you can't even have a semester out of that.</span> <span id="s907">But I did that; and then I would...as far as my books went, I would... Joyce and I would work our books together.</span> <span id="s908">Uh, but my father did get me through.</span> <span id="s909">And he would...he gave me like uh $5 a week; and uh I don't know I got.</span> <span id="s910">.</span> <span id="s911">I got through.</span> <span id="s912">I got through.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Q: And what happened after graduation?</span></p> <p><span id="s914">A: Well, after graduation... What happened is I graduated on June 14, and on June 21st I got married.</span> <span id="s915">So, you.</span> <span id="s916">.</span> <span id="s917">you know, I..</span> <span id="s918">.</span> <span id="s919">I didn't have to go back home again either.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">Q: Tell me about when you met your husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">A: Well, my husband met me...I think I was 16 at the time.</span> <span id="s922">And uh, first of all, he did not know very much about me.</span> <span id="s923">Because I had no accent whatsoever.</span> <span id="s924">I never told him where I was born.</span> <span id="s925">The only thing that struck him funny was that my parents had an accent; but, of course, it didn't mean that much to him because his grandparents had accents.</span> <span id="s926">And, I mean, it.</span> <span id="s927">.</span> <span id="s928">it just didn't mean anything.</span> <span id="s929">And uh I met him at a USYdance.</span> <span id="s930">We were introduced; and it was sort of an on and off type of a courtship that lasted for... Oh, I would say for about 5 years.</span> <span id="s931">I do remember that when I was... I think I was a junior.</span> <span id="s932">He...I mean he saw, you know, school was really tough on me.</span> <span id="s933">Real tough.</span> <span id="s934">And he...he really wanted me to quit.</span> <span id="s935">He really did!</span></p> <p><span id="s936">And, you know, we could get married and... But I wouldn't.</span> <span id="s937">I just wouldn't!</span> <span id="s938">There was no way, when I got this far, no matter how hard this was, that I would ever quit.</span> <span id="s939">I was determined I was going to march down the aisle and pick up that degree.</span> <span id="s940">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: Can you tell us about your reunion with the soldier?</span> <span id="s942">And do it briefly because we're...</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s944">.</span> <span id="s945">uh.</span> <span id="s946">.</span> <span id="s947">this was after my husband was in business.</span> <span id="s948">We had a convention in New Orleans.</span> <span id="s949">And uh I had this little picture with me, that he had given me after the war, that was taken of the two of us; and he had put his address in the back.</span> <span id="s950">We went to New Orleans.</span> <span id="s951">I took the picture with me.</span> <span id="s952">We went through the phone book and there were a few Jack Schultz in the phone book.</span> <span id="s953">We figured we'll go through each one of them.</span> <span id="s954">Called up, and I asked each one of them, "Were you in , Belgium, at such and such time?</span> <span id="s955">And are you familiar with uh...a person by the name of...” Which was "Susanne Ledon," because, of course, my real name would mean nothing to him.</span> <span id="s956">And finally, I hit upon the right person.</span> <span id="s957">And uh when I did there was total, total shock at the other end of the receiver.</span> <span id="s958">There wasn't a word uttered.</span> <span id="s959">And within 20 minutes, he was there.</span> <span id="s960">And I guess he must have told somebody, so the New Orleans press had covered excerpts of it.</span> <span id="s961">And it was quite a reunion.</span> <span id="s962">It really was.</span> <span id="s963">It uh...it was just, you know, great seeing him; and he couldn't believe it was me, and where I was, and... But uh it was really, really nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Q: Have you kept in contact with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s965">A: No, we lost contact again.</span> <span id="s966">And I..</span> <span id="s967">.</span> <span id="s968">I really don't know, you know, if he is still alive; because at this point he is a man way into his 80s already.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">2 United Synagogue Youth.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">PHOTOGRAPHS</span></p></body></html>
