<p><span id="s3">Mrs. Winkelman is a Holocaust survivor who has kindly consented to be interviewed for the records which the National Council of Jewish Women are compiling of Holocaust survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s4">Mrs. Winkelman, as I explained to you before we started the interview we’d like to know something about your early life.</span> <span id="s5">How many children were in your family, what did you parents do for a living, how much education did you have, how religious was your family, and also starting out with where did you come from.</span> <span id="s6">Where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s7">A: Well, I was born in a small town.</span> <span id="s8">The name of it was Wloclawek in Poland, it’s about 100 miles from Warsaw, the capital of Poland.</span> <span id="s9">I had a brother whose five years younger than I was.</span> <span id="s10">My parents were well off, not rich, but comfortable.</span> <span id="s11">Um, what else would I say about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Q: What kind of business did your father have?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A: Well, he was …had a business that was a combination of textiles and ah…had about twelve people working for him.</span> <span id="s14">My mother didn’t work, we had a maid.</span> <span id="s15">I had a woman who was taking care of me.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: A governess?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: Sort of a governess, and ah, I was a teenager.</span> <span id="s18">I was thirteen going on fourteen and eh, really nothing spectacular about my childhood occurred except that it was a nice family, and, well we were very comfortable.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: Did you have a religious family?</span> <span id="s20">Did they observe Friday night Sabbath traditions, or…</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: Well, not really.</span> <span id="s22">My grandparents were…they were not religious, but they observed the holidays.</span> <span id="s23">My parents since they were much younger, they were assimilated, I mean on, eh, on holidays they used to go to the synagogue, but it wasn’t like a traditional…what should I say…that we weren’t very religious.</span> <span id="s24">They spoke Polish very well.</span> <span id="s25">We didn’t speak Jewish at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: Did you have any formal religious training?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: Like children go to Sunday school?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: No.</span> <span id="s30">No.</span> <span id="s31">It was my parents spoke Jewish and they did speak only when they didn’t want us to understand, but actually we spoke Polish and ah, well we just…my parents felt that ah, since we are in Poland we should speak Polish, eh, very well without inflection, language inflection.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: As you were growing up, during your childhood, do you remember any anti-Semitic events occurring—either in the community or to yourself personally?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s34">We personally, I, as I said, my parents for some reasons they wanted me to be, eh, what should I say, as I should be comfortable in the Polish society.</span> <span id="s35">I should grow up with the eh, feelings that I’m no different in any Polish children so I could be educated, go to the university, and never have any problems and so on.</span> <span id="s36">But, ah, unfortunately, they were wrong because they send me to a school where there were no Jewish children, I think I was only one, no, there was another one in my class.</span> <span id="s37">And this was a few years before the war and, eh all my teachers were terribly anti-Semitic, and I could feel it every minute of, of my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: What about your classmates?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: Well, I had some friends but not all of them were my friends, you know, children could be very, ah, destructive.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: You say your teachers were anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s41">Was this based on remarks they made?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: Well, you could feel, you could feel it, I mean, I was a nice childe and I didn’t feel they felt that way, you know.</span> <span id="s43">They just disliked me, and, ah, whenever I made a mistake, they made sure to let me know about it.</span> <span id="s44">So, I felt very insecure to such point that after awhile I was crying a lot and I told my parents that I am not going to that school anymore.</span> <span id="s45">And finally a year before the war, then my marks were bad, too.</span> <span id="s46">They send me to a, eh, a Jewish gymnasium, it was partly Hebrew, which is on very high level, was very high level.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: In the same town?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: Yes, yeah, it was quite expensive, it was a private school.</span> <span id="s49">Maryknoll, and, uh, I felt so much better, I like, like I was reborn.</span> <span id="s50">And I was an excellent student.</span> <span id="s51">And I loved my teachers, they were very, very highly educated and intelligent, had many friends and my parents realized that they made a great mistake.</span> <span id="s52">And also in the business, eh, area you could see the anti-Semitism, you know…there were boards holding the Jewish businesses, and uh, well that’s how, how much we would feel of anti-Semitism in that town, but I understand in Warsaw and the big cities it was terrible.</span> <span id="s53">Like my husband used to tell me, he was much older than I was and he was attending the university in Warsaw, that he wasn’t able to attend the exams, had had to go to the professors and, and ah, pass his exams privately.</span> <span id="s54">They also were told that the Jews, the Jews were told that they have to sit on the left side of the room.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: That doesn’t make much sense, does it?</span> <span id="s56">But then a lot of things don’t make sense.</span> <span id="s57">You started to say something earlier as we were talking about your life was fairly normal until you were about thirteen or fourteen.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: Mmmhuh.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: What year was that, and what happened then?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: Well, it was 1939 when the war broke out, and the fall of 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: And Hitler invaded Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s63">And, eh, that’s how the whole mess started.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: Was there much political talk in your home.</span> <span id="s65">Did your parents talk about what had happened in Germany and Hitler coming to power?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: They were very polite…politically oriented, both of my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: Do you remember anything that they may have said about that, about Hitler and Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: Well, we knew what was going on, not to any extent, we didn’t even know later on what is happening, but…</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: You were saying that your parents knew about Hitler but that you said there wasn’t that much talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: Well, they were talking all the time.</span> <span id="s71">I mean, that was the most important things that would happen to us at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: But before Hitler invaded Poland, was there a sense of this was going to happen or was it a surprise to you, to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: Well, we knew that, eh, we knew about the war, but we didn’t know the consequences.</span> <span id="s74">As a matter of fact, at the times when I was so disgusted with my school, I was wishing that something drastically would happen and change my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: But not what did happen</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: That’s how little did I know what’s waiting.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: Can you tell me how your life did change from the time Germany invaded Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: Well that’s a big order.</span> <span id="s79">Let me just tell you a few words about the first few months of what happened in my town because later on we moved to Warsaw and that’s a whole different story.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">At the beginning, my first shock of my life, when the Germans occupied Poland, it was at my favorite uncle who lived in my parent’s house.</span> <span id="s81">My grandma, eh, my grandparents I mean, my grandmother died a few years before the war but my grandfather died a year before the war, so on the anniversary of his death, he and, and nine other men for a minyan.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: Mmmhuh, a minyan is ten people that you need for a religious prayer service.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: Right.</span> <span id="s84">And they were praying on this day and the Germans, I don’t know how they found out, but two Germans came by on motorcycles and entered the house and killed them all, except one.</span> <span id="s85">The one man was supposed to go out and dig the grave in their backyard and put them all into the grave.</span> <span id="s86">This was the greatest shock because the war just started!</span> <span id="s87">It was about five days after the Germans occupied Poland.</span> <span id="s88">As a matter of fact, the big book about my home town and the book starts with that event of my uncle and the ten of them.</span> <span id="s89">And when they came and told us about it, of course my mother got absolutely hysterical and my father and I was absolutely devastated.</span> <span id="s90">It was the first experience.</span> <span id="s91">Well, my mother begged the authority to, to be allowed to get the bodies out from the common grave and have it, have them buried in the cemetery.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Well, then they went where progressive , I can’t even, able to think about it.</span> <span id="s93">The next thing we had an order from the Germans that all the Jews, as of that day, are not allowed to walk on the sidewalk, and carriages with horses, and cars, few cars.</span> <span id="s94">And, I felt so humiliated and my mother said to me, “Don’t feel that way.</span> <span id="s95">The Germans should be ashamed.</span> <span id="s96">It’s not your fault.”</span> <span id="s97">And a few days later another thing happened.</span> <span id="s98">They burned the two synagogues.</span> <span id="s99">Gorgeous synagogues built in the seventeenth century.</span> <span id="s100">In just few hours, they had gone.</span> <span id="s101">And the had the nerve to ask the Jewish committee to come and to sign that this was done by the Jews.</span> <span id="s102">So things like this were happening so often and then they arrested my father and my uncle, another uncle, and they were in the prison for a few days.</span> <span id="s103">And then they started to deport people, we didn’t know where.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: You mentioned a minute ago the Jewish committee.</span> <span id="s105">Who were the people on the Jewish committee?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: The citizens.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: Not people sympathetic to the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: Sympathetic…nobody was sympathetic to the Germans as far as…</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: Well, within the camps there were some Jews that were, you know, to save themselves…</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: Not at this point, no.</span> <span id="s111">This was the beginning…</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: I mean at this point you were still in your little town?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: Yeah, well, eh, after a few months, eh maybe a few weeks after, I don’t remember, my parents decided that they’re going to move to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s114">They had some family there and, well, it wasn’t easy to part with your beautiful apartment and the furniture and everything you had and, but they made the decisions that something terrible was happening and we better leave before they will deport us someplace.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: You felt that it would be safer in Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: Yes, everybody was trying to get to Warsaw because Poland was, eh, sort of divided.</span> <span id="s117">It was German and German Reich-like, and Warsaw was still not independent but partially, autonomy.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s119">Up until the time you left for Warsaw, were you allowed to continue in school or did they close down the schools – or Jewish school?</span> <span id="s120">Were you allowed…was the school allowed to remain open?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: In Wloclawek, in the town?</span> <span id="s122">Not only did they close the schools they arrested all the teachers and send them out, probably executed them.</span> <span id="s123">It’s no question of schools at that time.</span> <span id="s124">This was a matter of life and death.</span> <span id="s125">Nobody had the luxury of going to school anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: So your whole lives were immediately put into turmoil?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s128">Well we arrived in Warsaw, and we lived with our cousins who have very nice big apartment and they let us have one room, we were four of us, supporting ourselves except the jewelry, and any valuables, articles we had with us, we were able to take it with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: How did you get from your small village to Warsaw?</span> <span id="s130">Did you take a train?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: Yeah, we went by train.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: Then you could not take things with you such as your furniture?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: No.</span> <span id="s134">So Warsaw was, eh, was very difficult.</span> <span id="s135">We were not hungry but we we were, we had very little food to eat.</span> <span id="s136">And, eh, the life in Warsaw was, at the beginning, was, eh, was, I mean not bad, we could still walk on the street and, and there were even coffee shops and theaters and movie houses, and, eh, I started going to school, which were not the regular school, but, eh, courses.</span> <span id="s137">But as the time went by, the Germans decided to make, eh, this part of Warsaw a ghetto, and we were about half a million people in that ghetto.</span> <span id="s138">And they built walls around us.</span> <span id="s139">And it’s, eh, was getting bad, worse.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: Did you have to share that apartment with more people than your own family eventually?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: No.</span> <span id="s142">We were with that family for a long time and…</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: Did they move more people into the apartment?</span> <span id="s144">You said it was a large apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: No.</span> <span id="s146">Nobody, nobody interfered at anything, any of our life in the Warsaw ghetto but people just didn’t have any jobs, and no income so more and more people were getting hungry.</span> <span id="s147">And, eh, more and more people are dying on the street.</span> <span id="s148">And it was terrible to watch that.</span> <span id="s149">I remember, while I was only fifteen at that time, maybe sixteen, I was very much involved in the social work of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s150">The refugees were coming from all the small towns without no means of supporting, and no families to help, and they were poor people, they didn’t have jewelry like we did so they didn’t have any beginning so when they came to the ghetto already the first few days were bad.</span> <span id="s151">So, we’ve had some kid of committees in Warsaw ghetto who tried to put them in houses or lofts or all kind of places.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: Just to put a roof over their heads.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s154">And we young children were gathering the food from our parents, collecting whatever we could, vegetables, grains, and we were cooking for them once a day and that was their only meal – once a day.</span> <span id="s155">But, of course, was time we didn’t have any more food for them, they would just die in their beds, so that was a horrible period.</span> <span id="s156">And as time was going by, I mean, people were dying and schools were closed, closing, and, eh, no more coffee shops, or no more stores, and everything was dying out and half a million people were in a very small area, you could hardly walk on the streets – there were so many.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: As I understand from what you’re saying, this was literally a wall with gates, so that at night you were locked into the ghetto?</span> <span id="s158">Is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: No.</span> <span id="s160">You were not allowed to go out, ever.</span> <span id="s161">The Germans were patrolling…</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: Not even to work.</span> <span id="s163">Not even for any reason?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: We don’t have…we didn’t have any work.</span> <span id="s165">We were isolated from the rest of the Polish community, like…</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: Sounds like a really desperate kind of life…</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: Was horrible.</span> <span id="s168">The economy was based on people who had money because there were rich people in Poland, Jews.</span> <span id="s169">They had money and the people who didn’t have money.</span> <span id="s170">So the people who didn’t have money, they starved and died.</span> <span id="s171">The rich people were getting poorer and poorer.</span> <span id="s172">That’s what it was, it was the exchange of the material between the people and, as far as the food, people were smuggling through the walls from the Polish side for the money the people had accumulated from before the war.</span> <span id="s173">But, eh, well, this was until ’43, ’42.</span> <span id="s174">When, eh, the final solution came into effect, eh, that was the real horror.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: Up until then had there been any knowledge of the concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: They existed before that.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: We knew about labor camps, that people go to work and they get minimal of food but they do get it and they work and they hope for the end of the war.</span> <span id="s179">But we didn’t know anything about liquidations or gas chambers, or anything like that.</span> <span id="s180">And, as a matter of fact, I knew few families who were very poor, they were close to starvation and they volunteered, they went to the labor camp because they felt at least they would have some bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: Anything would be better than nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: Right.</span> <span id="s183">Well, they didn’t know that there are not such things like labor camps.</span> <span id="s184">Well, the Germans built few factories in the ghettos.</span> <span id="s185">They were manufacturing, eh, the uniforms for the Russian front and many people were employed there.</span> <span id="s186">As a matter of fact, it was compulsory to be employed at a certain point.</span> <span id="s187">And eh, I think it was 1942 when they decided to liquidate the Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s188">Well, it’s a long story, I think.</span> <span id="s189">How this technique was put into life.</span> <span id="s190">You ask me questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: What was the technique?</span> <span id="s192">What process did they follow to bring about this liquidation?</span> <span id="s193">Was there a pattern to how they selected people?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s195">At the beginning they, they formed a police force among the Jewish men and they told them that every day they have to submit, that’s each policeman, hundred people to a certain center and in exchange they will get a document where they would be protected from going to concentration camps of whatever and their families.</span> <span id="s196">Well, the policemen who were working as policemen, I mean function of a policeman, resigned but some of…quite many stayed in their post and were rounding up people.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: Mostly men or men and women?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: No.</span> <span id="s199">Men only.</span> <span id="s200">Well they discovered after a very short time, maybe few weeks only, that that didn’t prevent the Germans to take them too, and their families.</span> <span id="s201">So, they had to get away with that – get away is not the right expression.</span> <span id="s202">Do away.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Well, the next thing was, eh, that the Germans just started to take people from houses and take them to the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s204">They were trains established at a certain part of the ghetto and they were rounding them up and telling the women to be on one side and the men on the other side, and they were taking them to the concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: Is that the way they told them, or where did they tell them they were taking them?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: Well, they told, they didn’t tell, they didn’t have to tell them anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: Well, no, I realize they didn’t have to but I’ve heard people say they said, “Take a small suitcase and enough food for one day and you’re going to a labor camp,” or they would make up some fictitious thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: Probably.</span> <span id="s209">I really don’t know because I wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s210">I was still a very young girl.</span> <span id="s211">It, everything happened so, so fast from all sides, it, so it was really difficult to understand what is going on – what is the politics – what is the technique of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">At that time I remember I was involved in eh, the underground of the Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s213">My friends were my age and a little older, mostly were older, decided that they are whatever is going to happen, and they didn’t know what’s going to happen afterward we’ll have to get organized and we’ll have to do something drastic so we had few meetings and we were discussing how to go about it.</span> <span id="s214">But it was really, eh, wasn’t, didn’t make much sense because we didn’t have any, any basis to go on.</span> <span id="s215">We didn’t have any, any material and the instructions and the money, anything to work with, and then the weapons, nothing to work with.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">So I remember one of the meetings one of our ladies decided such if the worst comes to worse, what we have to do is put one of the factories on fire – burn it down, because quite many Germans were in that factory and also the whole administration was German and also would stop the production of uniforms and would show them that, that we really care what is going on and we’re not going to let them do whatever they want.</span> <span id="s217">We knew that it was a suicidal thing, but I mean just to, we’d, the rather try to do, we’d, we rather try to do it for ourselves than anything else.</span> <span id="s218">And, but it was a very tra-traumatic thing to do, I was very much against it.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: So did they do this?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: No, because my parents, at that time, were employed there.</span> <span id="s221">And my friends and my uncles.</span> <span id="s222">I said I just can’t do it.</span> <span id="s223">I mean it’s beautiful that I am going to destroy the factory and the Germans but I’m going to destroy my family and they tried to explain that very little do we know about it.</span> <span id="s224">That they are going to be destroyed anyway.</span> <span id="s225">So what’s the difference?</span> <span id="s226">But you can buy things like that, you know, you can just be sure that all you predict is going to happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: And you can’t deliberately shorten your family’s lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: Right.</span> <span id="s229">So this movement didn’t have, eh, much appeal.</span> <span id="s230">But what happened later on to this movement, they trained themselves, they were determined, and they became fighters and I don’t know how much you know about it, but they were able to go through the canals through underground – to sewers.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: I’ve read this book.</span> <span id="s232">Mila 18, by Leon Uris.</span> <span id="s233">How accurate a representation is it?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: Very accurate.</span> <span id="s235">Very accurate.</span> <span id="s236">Of course, they were killed at the entrances – at the exits – most of them.</span> <span id="s237">But some of them escaped into the woods and were, were able to fight for a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: They put up a tremendous resistance.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: Well, there was a different group which stayed in the Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s240">And they were so fantastic that they would, they were able to manufacture their own bombs.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: Yes, I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: And it’s unbelievable that they could resist the German army, well not an army, but I mean some kind of a units for three weeks in Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s243">But this was after the liquidation of Warsaw ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: How did this affect you, the liquidation?</span> <span id="s245">Not you – your family – all of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: Yea, well, eh, I have, had friends, or a friend I would say, he was my boyfriends, but, I mean, he was eighteen – I was sixteen or seventeen and his family was able to leave the ghetto and go to the Polish side.</span> <span id="s247">And he asked if I would, if I would be willing to do it, if I would go and I said, “I can’t leave my family and I will go there and not know what is going to happen to them.”</span> <span id="s248">And my parents, eh, once they heard about it, they were very anxious that I should go and begged me to do it, that once I go maybe it’s a possibility that they could be saved in some way.</span> <span id="s249">So, my friend came through the roofs from the Polish side, through the wall, and I went.</span> <span id="s250">It’s an opening – every house has an opening, like a chimney, and he took me away from then and from the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: And what year was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: Forty…January, ‘43</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: And he took me to his brother and sister and his broth…his sister-in-law where I stayed and he lived in a different place and he promised that he would try to get my parents out.</span> <span id="s255">At that time, we were able to contact a Polish family who were willing to take my parents for money.</span> <span id="s256">And, eh, a few weeks later, he was going to take my parents out for the same way he took me out.</span> <span id="s257">But a day before the people, the Polish people, changed their minds and he couldn’t do it because was no place to take them.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: They became afraid for themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: Right.</span> <span id="s260">Well, a few months later.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: Where were you staying?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: Well, as the beginning I stayed with his family.</span> <span id="s263">Then, for some reason, the Polish people found out about it, so they had to run to a different village and I stayed behind.</span> <span id="s264">Actually, I was on my own.</span> <span id="s265">I was seventeen, not much money, completely isolated.</span> <span id="s266">The only thing I had is that my friend, his brother, was able to give me false papers because without it papers which would hold , you were not able to survive, I mean somebody would ask you, you about your identity and you’d can’t show the card, I mean, you could be arrested.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: There must have been a brisk business in manufacturing false identity papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: Of course, in the business was an underground organization.</span> <span id="s269">So, I was trying to survive and eh, the way I was going from one villa to another asking if I could rent a room and, eh, after a day or two, after searching, I found one place and I had my, my history was, of course, all was fabricated, under a different name and a different, my history was different, and I had to remember everything, not to make a mistake.</span> <span id="s270">And I lived in one place for a few months until they realized that something is wrong and they didn’t want to give it, give me up to the Gestapo, but they just told me to divulge.</span> <span id="s271">So that had to repeat so many times I, in the two years, I think I lived in about seven places.</span> <span id="s272">And so, there were many, many instances which I could write a book what was happening during this time.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: These were always with Polish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: With Polish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: Not Jewish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: Jewish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: Non-Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s279">And, eh, we had few instances with the Germans coming over and, eh, looking for Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: What happened to your brother during this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: Well, after I left Warsaw ghetto, I understand the rest of the people were taken out to the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s282">And they called me only once, maybe two days before such so many people are being taken away, that they expect any day that they will go, too.</span> <span id="s283">But they didn’t know exactly what’s going to happen in there because nobody came back to tell anybody.</span> <span id="s284">So, we were hoping that we’ll survive somehow.</span> <span id="s285">But, I never saw them again.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: It’s a very painful memory.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">(A few minutes of this interview was intentionally not recorded.)</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: At the point of which I’ve turned the tape over, what were we saying?</span> <span id="s289">I asked you what you had said what you did during the day that you taught children and you made cigarettes.</span> <span id="s290">And then you said, and then I said, did you eat your meals with the family?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: Sometimes.</span> <span id="s292">Yes, sometimes.</span> <span id="s293">Well, and then the war was over and, eh, my…</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: Well, what do you remember about the war being over.</span> <span id="s295">How did you learn about it?</span> <span id="s296">How did people act when they learned the war was over?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: Well, they were screaming and yelling and the, everybody was so joyful on the streets.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: And the Germans left right away?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: Well, they were leaving, they were – last few days, I mean that wasn’t important.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: Were you aware that the war was coming to an end because the Germans started to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: Well, just one day we knew that, well, I don’t know if you know the history of, of the war during the, in Warsaw, that we had an uprising in Warsaw, that the Russian were on the other side of the river and the Polish people have an uprising in Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: Were you proud of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: No, because I wasn’t in Warsaw, I was in the outskirts of Warsaw.</span> <span id="s304">I failed to say about my friend who helped me survive, that he was in the underground.</span> <span id="s305">Once he rescued me he, he felt he’s not able to go ahead with his life and just save his life without helping the cause so he went after he brought me over, to his family, he went back to the Warsaw ghetto and joined the fighters, the Jewish fighters.</span> <span id="s306">And every few days he would come and say hello to me, give me the report how was the fight going in the Warsaw ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: It must have been very difficult for him to go back and forth that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: Well, it wasn’t a question of being difficult.</span> <span id="s309">It was a question of life and death, that something he had to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: I understand that, but I mean to come out of the ghetto -- and to tell you about it – and then to back in again.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A: Well, it was, I don’t know exactly how he did it, but with what was the contact with his family and me and the fighters, and on one day he even brought ammunition into our room that we should keep it for safekeeping a few days.</span> <span id="s312">It was his only place to, to come.</span> <span id="s313">Well, after a few weeks we lost the contact with him.</span> <span id="s314">He never came back.</span> <span id="s315">But his friend came and he told me that his in the woods and probably was killed.</span> <span id="s316">He asked mi if I wanted to join the Partisans in the woods and I said, of course, I can’t stay here.</span> <span id="s317">I don’t have anybody to talk, to share.</span> <span id="s318">Nothing, I mean you can’t live like this.</span> <span id="s319">And I was ready to join him.</span> <span id="s320">He told me to be ready.</span> <span id="s321">He will pick me up in three days.</span> <span id="s322">I should take on the essentials with me and he would take me to join the partisans who left, the fighters who left the Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s323">But he never came.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: So you have to assume that he didn’t survive either.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: Yeah, well, I’m jumping from one to another because I just, too many things.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: There are too many things going through your head, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: Well, let’s go back to the end of the war.</span> <span id="s328">The family of my friend were wonderful people.</span> <span id="s329">They live right now in Sweden.</span> <span id="s330">They took care of me.</span> <span id="s331">He was a professors before the war and he tried to get me an apartment in Warsaw and all his friends were also professors so he was so nice to establish a, a sort of help in my education and they were sitting with my for many hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: This is after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: After the war</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: And this is where now?</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: In Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: In Warsaw.</span> <span id="s337">You stayed in Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s339">And they were trying to help me with my education, which I lost for so many years, to prepare me for the last two years in school and, eh, I attended school and then I was able to apply the university in Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: How did you feel about staying in Warsaw after all that had happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: Well, the whole thing was a shock because I was, I think nineteen when the war ended with no family, not one person.</span> <span id="s342">The only friends I had were the friends of my, the family of my friend, but I was so eager to go on with my life and to learn to study, that somehow I met my future husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">end of Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: Where did you meet him?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: Ehh, it’s a story in itself, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: Well, it’s up to you if you would like to say.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s349">A important story.</span> <span id="s350">As I said, I was born in Wloclawek, a small town, and after the war – about half a year after the war – after I established myself a little bit, I was dying to go to that town and see if anything’s was there which reminds me of my childhood.</span> <span id="s351">Maybe somebody survived – they would go there and I would meet them.</span> <span id="s352">So, I did go and there were five Jews – they form a committee and I introduced myself and they said, “Nobody is alive from your family, but, we have a letter from a Polish family that a child survived.</span> <span id="s353">Your aunt’s baby.”</span> <span id="s354">And I knew the baby because she had this child in the Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s355">And I saw this child from she was only a few months old and I know they left – they lived among the Polish people, and probably they got killed by the Germans, or by the Polish people, and the child was put into the park, with the name of the parents and the place where they were born.</span> <span id="s356">I found that later…</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: In the park?</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: In the park?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: You mean like, like leaving someone on a doorstep?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: They would just leave the baby in the park?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: Right.</span> <span id="s365">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: Okay – just want to make sure I understood.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s368">And I found about the story later on when I contacted this family.</span> <span id="s369">How very .</span> <span id="s370">When I came to this Wloclawek, this town, they gave me this letter from a family telling me – asking – anybody, if they know if anybody survived from this family.</span> <span id="s371">So right away I know that’s my, my aunt, my mother’s sister, and I know the child, so, I decided to go back and look up the family and look up the child.</span> <span id="s372">I met my husband there because he also was from the same town and he also came from Warsaw to see if anybody survived from his family, and we met, and I told him about the child and he helped me to locate it.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: How remarkable a coincidence that was.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s375">And, ah, well we were married later on.</span> <span id="s376">As far as the child I – I met the people and they were lovely couple, old couple.</span> <span id="s377">And I tried to explain to them that they should give up the child, that the child should go to Israel.</span> <span id="s378">I was thinking about adopting it, but my husband wasn’t very anxious.</span> <span id="s379">At that time I – we were not married even and I was not even twenty and we had plans to immigrate from Poland, so, the best thing for – would be for the child to send it to Israel to a kibbutz.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Well, the people didn’t want to give up the child, because they were – they didn’t Have any of their own and they loved that little baby, but they were very decent and understanding, understanding, and I was able to raise money for them from the Jewish organization and they were paid very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: And the child did go to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s383">The child went to Israel through the organization.</span> <span id="s384">Well, I was taking care of the child but in the meantime we married and a small, modest apartment an the child stay with us a little bit until the child was able to immigrate – that was the famous oxodus – ah –exodus to Israel…and this is my only surviving family.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: Do you maintain contact with… You didn’t say.</span> <span id="s386">Is the child a boy or a girl?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: She’s a girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: Do you maintain contact with…</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: They were the closest family of mine.</span> <span id="s390">She, she grew up to a fantastic person.</span> <span id="s391">We helped them…we help her to educate herself.</span> <span id="s392">I mean, not so much, eh, in material sense as encouraging her.</span> <span id="s393">She left the kibbutz.</span> <span id="s394">She met a wonderful man who is a professor at Technion presently.</span> <span id="s395">She made her doctor degree.</span> <span id="s396">They have lovely children, two children, as a matter of fact.</span> <span id="s397">They live in the United States.</span> <span id="s398">Now he’s teaching in Ann Arbor, Michigan.</span> <span id="s399">He’s one of the greatest professors in Ann Arbor, in the engineering department.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: So you get to see them more often than if they were in Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: He was just here a few weeks ago.</span> <span id="s402">But they are great Israeli patriots so they -- she is in Israel right now.</span> <span id="s403">They don’t intend to stay in United States, but, ah, he’s wanted so much by the universities.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: And, how did you come to this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: Well, we married in Poland and, and my husband’s family was in the United States so we, we were able through Sweden to come to United States.</span> <span id="s406">We waited for the visa in Sweden for about five years.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: Well, that’s a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s409">And then we went to Canada.</span> <span id="s410">We waited in Canada for another year, two years.</span> <span id="s411">And then we came to United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: What was it like after such a long wait to come here?</span> <span id="s413">I mean, was it like the realization of a dream or were you angry and frustrated with having to wait so long and has it measure up to what you expected of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: Do you talk of the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: Well, in a way it was like coming to a heaven, and, the freedom, and New York being cosmopolitan city where you felt at home – was wonderful – was wonderful.</span> <span id="s417">I got a lot of experience working in an office in Sweden and in Canada.</span> <span id="s418">I didn’t have any difficulties in getting, getting a very good job in New York after being a few weeks in this country.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: Did you learn to speak English while you were still in Poland, or Sweden?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: You told me before we started taping about a professor you had had who said that the important thing about the whole experience was how it had affected you as a person.</span> <span id="s422">Do you want to talk about that as it applies to yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: Well, it’s very difficult to speak about all this kind of things without being prepared because I, I really have to put things in certain perspectives of order because it’s a combination of my emotions and the reality.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Well, what I was saying that, um the reality is one thing and the changes, but psychology is something else because it really affects us in so many ways and we see each other in different light.</span> <span id="s425">It depends on, on the changes.</span> <span id="s426">And sometimes you don’t recognize yourself because you don’t think that you – you don’t expect yourself to react in certain ways.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: Can you give an example?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: Well, that’s – that’s very general.</span> <span id="s429">Well, I would rather you ask me questions, I wouldn’t know what to answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: Well, I’m not sure what question to ask you to elicit that kind of an answer, but you say you find yourself reacting in unexpected ways and I’m asking if you can, you know, pinpoint that as to something that, that happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: Well…</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: To which you reacted differently?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: Well, what I’m trying to say is the values of life.</span> <span id="s434">You would think that a person who goes through that kind of horrors and experiences is resigned to certain things, or – or have a certain goals.</span> <span id="s435">But it’s not necessarily so.</span> <span id="s436">I’m surprisingly so – that I – I adapt so easily to new environments and new situations.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: Well, you had to do a tremendous amount of adapting during the war years, and afterwards moving from Poland to Sweden, to Canada, to the United States – that’s a lot of adapting.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s439">And that’s what I’m going to say – that life, somehow – it’s a very philosophical discussion – but life somehow is so strong, that you could be so trivial about things, that what happened is -- it’s really in your past – you don’t forget it – but it’s like on a different level and I sometimes I’m blaming myself for it.</span> <span id="s440">How come I’m so interested in, in other things now?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: Well, because you have to keep living.</span> <span id="s442">You can’t live in the past.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: Yes, but, eh, sometimes it comes to a point if you – you –you live a completely different life, like a completely different, different, person.</span> <span id="s444">And my husband sometimes asks me, “Aren’t you affected by it constantly?</span> <span id="s445">You are so normal!”</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: That’s a great compliment.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: I know.</span> <span id="s448">But I think maybe, I don’t know, I’m strong, but, eh, I’m catching myself on that.</span> <span id="s449">I’m really – I can, I can cope with everything like – like that past didn’t never existed.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: Well, I think you should feel very proud of yourself.</span> <span id="s451">I have asked you a lot of questions but am going to make the comment that even though I’ve asked you a lot of questions there may be something I haven’t asked you that you would like to include in this recording.</span> <span id="s452">There may not be, but sometimes I overlook something?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: Like a golden torch or something?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: Or some event that I many not have touched on or something that you may have thought of after you passed that point in chronology.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: Well, as I said, it’s such a broad area that you can’t cover it in a short interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: That’s true.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: Well, it’s just, it’s spots, and it’s very vivid in my mind.</span> <span id="s458">I can see the separate scenes, but eh, but to put it all together and, and analyze it, it’s more than having an interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: Yes, I’m sure that it is.</span> <span id="s460">But meanwhile, I want to thank you for sharing with us all that you have shared.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A: Thank you.</span> <span id="s462">You’re very welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: It will be put to good use and it will be a permanent record here in Sarasota for the use of people who want to do further research as well as being shared in classrooms.</span> <span id="s464">Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: You’re very welcome.</span></p></body></html>
