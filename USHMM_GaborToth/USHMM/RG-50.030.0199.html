<p><span id="s18">A: I was raised in a small town.</span> <span id="s19">It's in southern Poland it's named Kolbuszowa, and this belonged to the minor Poland.</span> <span id="s20">We called it in Polish Mourpoliska.</span> <span id="s21">And before the first world war, it belonged to Alsea which was called Galicia.</span> <span id="s22">In 1920.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: Tell me a little bit about your parents and your family before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: Well, we were a very large family.</span> <span id="s25">We were nine children, five sisters and four brothers.</span> <span id="s26">I was the youngest from the nine.</span> <span id="s27">My father was a Hasidic Jew, very religious, my mother...the whole family was very religious.</span> <span id="s28">He had a long grey beard and my mother was very religious.</span> <span id="s29">She wear a Sheitel, which means a wig.</span> <span id="s30">And everything was around Jewish tradition, Jewish religion.</span> <span id="s31">I attended when I was 3 years, I started heder, which means a school for boys.</span> <span id="s32">Til 3 years I had my hair.</span> <span id="s33">By 3 years, they cut off my hair, but they left side locks.</span> <span id="s34">And after this heder when I was 6 years, I attended a small Yeshiva.</span> <span id="s35">They called it Yeshiva for the young boys.</span> <span id="s36">I also started public school, regular public schools for which was together with the Polish boys.</span> <span id="s37">And when I was 15 years I was sent out to a Yeshiva to a very famous Rabbi in the town named Tarnow, a larger town and which my father was a disciple of this Rabbi.</span> <span id="s38">He was a follower, so he send me to his Yeshiva.</span> <span id="s39">And then when I came back...I wasn't there too long, because I wasn't very happy with it, I started to work in my father's business.</span> <span id="s40">And my father had a wholesale store in which we sold everything.</span> <span id="s41">Now the stores in the villages used to come to us and they bought the merchandise for their stores.</span> <span id="s42">So here you could call it a general store.</span> <span id="s43">We had there everything what was needed for a household, we sold it.</span> <span id="s44">And it was quite a prosperous business.</span> <span id="s45">Our town mostly, they were very poor Jews.</span> <span id="s46">I would say 50 percent were poor, and 40 percent made a living, and 10 percent were rich Jews.</span> <span id="s47">My father was considered to be among the 10 percent rich Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">And this how we lived.</span> <span id="s49">It was a very close family.</span> <span id="s50">My sisters, when they were married, my father saw to it that they would remain in our town.</span> <span id="s51">He gave them a dowry.</span> <span id="s52">He bought them a house, and he established a business for them.</span> <span id="s53">What he used to do, he used to take a branch from our business and he gave it over to him and he took care of this on a wholesale level for this business.</span> <span id="s54">And this we lived quite happily til the war.</span> <span id="s55">My oldest brother went to America in 1919 one year before I was born because in 1919 we had the pogrom.</span> <span id="s56">The Poles came and they killed nine Jews, wounded 200, and this pogrom was for the celebration of gaining independence.</span> <span id="s57">So what is a better way to celebrate independence after so many years than to have a little pogrom.</span> <span id="s58">Not a big one, but at least nine people killed.</span> <span id="s59">So after this, my oldest brother left and he came to America.</span> <span id="s60">So he didn't know me because I was born a year later.</span> <span id="s61">In 1933, my second brother left.</span> <span id="s62">He became a Zionist which all family was always in.</span> <span id="s63">There were Hasidic, but they always were, all the sisters belong to Zionist organizations and even my father was enough up-to-date that he was a Zionist.</span> <span id="s64">And my brother left in 1933 as a Chalutz, as a pioneer in this time.</span> <span id="s65">So those brothers were out from our town, but the rest were living in our town til the war started.</span> <span id="s66">And it was a happy life.</span> <span id="s67">I was never satisfied with this life in this little stetl because I looked for something else.</span> <span id="s68">I wanted to go to school.</span> <span id="s69">I wanted to study.</span> <span id="s70">I wanted to go to gymnasium.</span> <span id="s71">My dream was to become a doctor, but I was too young and I was maybe too weak to say to my father, "I want to take off this Hasidic clothing," which I always hated, "and to be like everybody else, to be a modern man.”</span> <span id="s72">But it didn't come til a year before the war.</span> <span id="s73">I joined the Zionist organization which was the Hanoar Hatzioni.</span> <span id="s74">It was the young movement and I was very happy because this was the tie that gave me a chance to belong to organization together with girls, which before I couldn't speak to her.</span> <span id="s75">There was special one girl which I fell in love when I was 12 years old, and I had a chance to be with her together with our other friends, and this was quite a happy time for me that I could get out of this burden of what my father wanted me to be a Hasidic boy to sit in the temple, in the synagogue and to study from morning til night.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: What happened when the war broke out?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: Well, then before the war we started to feel when the things happened to Germany, we felt it in Poland.</span> <span id="s78">We felt it because the climate started to be...the Poles started to show their anti- Semitism a little more openly.</span> <span id="s79">Til 1935 was not so bad because til 1935, Pilsudki was the marshall in Poland, and he was quite good for Jews.</span> <span id="s80">And the minute Pilsudski died, a lot of tihngs happened.</span> <span id="s81">It changed.</span> <span id="s82">Smidli took it over and then special laws came out against Jews.</span> <span id="s83">The businesses started to be bad for Jews.</span> <span id="s84">They opened cooperatives and slogans were all over and they used to say in Poland, [polish] [polish] means everybody to his own for his own.</span> <span id="s85">The small businesses lost everything because those cooperatives started small businesses in the villages.</span> <span id="s86">So what they did.</span> <span id="s87">peasants didn't sell their produce to Jews, so usually used to buy them, but they brought them to the cooperatives and they used to exchange them for merchandise they needed.</span> <span id="s88">So they cut out the Jew who bought the produce and they cut out the Jew who sold them their merchandise.</span> <span id="s89">But we, our family didn't suffer because they were not enough advanced to have wholesale places to supply the storekeepers in the villages.</span> <span id="s90">So even there were more storekeepers in the villages, our business improved because they had to come to us for this merchandise to sell to the peasants in the villages.</span> <span id="s91">So we didn't feel it.</span> <span id="s92">But my father always said that this is only for a time being because eventually they will be enough advanced to start their own wholesale stores and their own manufacturing, that they will cut out even the wholesale letting the manufacture which was mostly in Jewish hands.</span> <span id="s93">So we knew this is only...in a short time, our business will go down also.</span> <span id="s94">And then the climate was so bad that everything what happened in Germany from the papers we started to see, it started to happen in Poland.</span> <span id="s95">There was a time that they tried to forbid ritual slaughter for kosher meat which in the time of Pilsudski would never happen, but it happened, but the Jews fought back and it didn't come to be that the slaughters should be forbidden.</span> <span id="s96">Also, they organized ,they established a concentration camp on the system that it was in Germany in this time because in Germany even before the war, they had a few concentration camp, which starting with Dachau, Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s97">So they had in Poland, a concentration camp in Breizakotuska .</span> <span id="s98">This was in the northern part in Poland.</span> <span id="s99">And what they brought in mostly, supposedly to be for communists which were enemies of the state, but also Jews who they thought didn't do such business, they did something wrong.</span> <span id="s100">Instead to put them to jail or instead they give them fine, they brought them over to this concentration camp, which was a very notorious concentration camp.</span> <span id="s101">So all those things were prepared against the Jews.</span> <span id="s102">Like for instance, there was the Prime Minister.</span> <span id="s103">His name was Slatkovski ?</span> <span id="s104">.</span> <span id="s105">He was a general, so he even was a very famous expression, when there was a debate about Jews and people say the Jews have to go out of Poland, be thrown out of Poland, beaten up in Poland, so he said to beat up Jews no, but to destroy them economically he said ofshun.</span> <span id="s106">In Polish ofshun means by all means.</span> <span id="s107">So this was a very famous saying, ofshun, Prime Minister said that we have to do it.</span> <span id="s108">Now, for instance, the...</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s110">I'm gonna have to break in if I may.</span> <span id="s111">We need...for this interview, I want to talk about you.</span> <span id="s112">So let's focus on what happened to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: Alright.</span> <span id="s114">Well, this I give you just a feeling how the situation and this was so in this time, I decided that I have to leave Poland, that this Poland was not for me, so I had to leave.</span> <span id="s115">Now to leave Poland wasn't so easy because where would you go to?</span> <span id="s116">I wanted to go to Palestine because I became a Zionist and this was my dream.</span> <span id="s117">But to go to Palestine wasn't so easy.</span> <span id="s118">I was little too young, and then later you had to have a certificate from the English government and only a few got and a few were lucky in that.</span> <span id="s119">And so I decided to go illegal to Palestine.</span> <span id="s120">So in 1938, I joined a groups that we paid in money and we're supposed to be smuggled to Romania, and Romania to take a boat illegal to enter Palestine.</span> <span id="s121">So we had to pay 500 zlotys for it; 500 zlotys was quite a lot of money.</span> <span id="s122">I decided with a friend of mine, he was a very close friend.</span> <span id="s123">Now this boy didn't have the 500 zlotys, so I remember the day when the letter came that we should pay it in, I paid in my 500 zlotys, and he didn't have it.</span> <span id="s124">So his mother had two silver candlesticks, probably from her mother, so she went and she had to sell the two candlesticks and still he didn't have the 200...the 500 zlotys.</span> <span id="s125">He was short 200, so I remember I gave him the 200 zlotys, and he said he would pay it back to me in Palestine.</span> <span id="s126">And we paid in and we were prepared and we waited to go, but this never came to be and the war in the middle started and we supposed to go in August and the war started in September, the 1st of September.</span> <span id="s127">And this dream fell through.</span> <span id="s128">Also I wanted to come to America because I had here a brother, and all my father's brothers and sisters were here.</span> <span id="s129">My father was the only one who remained home.</span> <span id="s130">So I wrote them letters and I begged them to send me papers.</span> <span id="s131">But none of them sent me papers.</span> <span id="s132">Only what they had to do is to invest 25 cents to go to another Republic and send me affidavit.</span> <span id="s133">But they didn't do it.</span> <span id="s134">And when they didn't do it, so America was out.</span> <span id="s135">Palestine was out.</span> <span id="s136">So I had to stay there til the Germans came in.</span> <span id="s137">Now, 1st of September the war broke out.</span> <span id="s138">And it was a very bad feeling because we knew that this something terrible will happen.</span> <span id="s139">Everybody there were rumors that the Polish army is strong.</span> <span id="s140">We have a strong calvary, and they mobilized people, the older people.</span> <span id="s141">Now the Polish government, I don't know if they did it purposefully, if they had traitors there, because they mobilized old people.</span> <span id="s142">People who used to serve in the Austrian army in the first world war.</span> <span id="s143">The young people they didn't mobilize.</span> <span id="s144">And so I felt that my duty, I felt myself as a Polish patriot.</span> <span id="s145">I wanted to be part of Poland.</span> <span id="s146">I lived in Poland.</span> <span id="s147">So I went and I volunteered to the army soon as the war broke out.</span> <span id="s148">They didn't accept me because they said they don't have enough uniforms for the regular army.</span> <span id="s149">How would they take me?</span> <span id="s150">So my parents naturally didn't know that I went and I volunteered.</span> <span id="s151">The feeling was that something terrible will happen and we awaited it.</span> <span id="s152">Now the 1st of September, the war broke out right a day, 2, 3 days later.</span> <span id="s153">Thousands of refugee came through our town.</span> <span id="s154">And most refugee who fled from the western part of Poland came to us and the reason why they came to us is because we didn't have a railroad.</span> <span id="s155">And there was a short cut from Tarnow to cut through to the east, and usually when there was a railroad the Germans used to bomb the railroad and to shoot, so this way because there were fields so they used to go through this route, thousands and thousands, every day more and more.</span> <span id="s156">And then later you could see the army broken up, broken units, and they came through our town.</span> <span id="s157">And Saturday, the 9th of September, the Germans came in.</span> <span id="s158">And as we were never a lucky town, like we had a pogrom; we had other things always happen in our town.</span> <span id="s159">So Saturday morning the town was clear.</span> <span id="s160">There were no Polish soldiers, so we figured there would not be no battle and the Germans will come and take the town.</span> <span id="s161">So it happens at 12 o'clock, a new regiment came in that had run away and they said they're going to make a line in our town.</span> <span id="s162">And the Germans came in about 3 o'clock, and there was a battle and there were 65 Germans killed and about 200 Polish soldiers, and there were about 150 Jewish civilians.</span> <span id="s163">Why Jewish?</span> <span id="s164">They didn't kill when there was a battle picking out Jews, but the Jews were the refugees.</span> <span id="s165">They didn't know where to hide.</span> <span id="s166">They mostly were Jews, because Poles didn't run away.</span> <span id="s167">They were not so much afraid so they were caught in the middle in a strange town and they were killed.</span> <span id="s168">And the atrocities started right away.</span> <span id="s169">They took us out in a open place, and they burned half of the town.</span> <span id="s170">And we were in the middle and they came and they said that the battle, the fight was done by Jews, not by Polish soldiers, and for this reason they're going to burn alive all the Jews from our town.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">And they burned, they purposely started to burn the town, the houses around where we were located.</span> <span id="s172">And we saw that maybe they will do these things, which they did not at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">But it so happened in the evening, somebody came and they said, "No.</span> <span id="s174">They will let us go.”</span> <span id="s175">And they kept us for a whole night in the fields.</span> <span id="s176">The next day we came home, and all the houses were plundered, the houses which were not burned were plundered.</span> <span id="s177">The Germans stayed in there a half day.</span> <span id="s178">They went in and took out everything they wanted.</span> <span id="s179">And we started to live under German occupation.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: Can you slow down just a moment.</span> <span id="s181">Tell us what it was like for you under these conditions?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">What did it feel like you standing there watching all this?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: When I was watching where we were in this place, surrounded and when they started to burn the houses around us and I saw there the young soldiers standing there and watching us and I looked at them and in this time I imagined myself being him.</span> <span id="s184">Being in a uniform, having a rifle in my hand, and he should be the victim.</span> <span id="s185">And I was thinking, "Would I let him die, to be burned alive?"</span> <span id="s186">Because there were children started to cry and I wanted to compare myself what I would do in that case like this and I couldn't understand that they came and they occupy a town and take civilian people and kill them.</span> <span id="s187">Because we were sure that they would keep their promise and they would burn us.</span> <span id="s188">So then later, the next day they started to take us to work.</span> <span id="s189">And every day they came and they took out everybody and there was a lot of work.</span> <span id="s190">The whole Polish army was broken up and we had to clean the weapons and used shells from cannons and we used to load it on trucks to take away.</span> <span id="s191">Also, we had maybe a hundred dead horses because it happened that this unit which came to our town this day, this was a cavalry unit and when the fighting started, the horses were killed.</span> <span id="s192">And the horses were laying dead, and this was still hot summer, so it start that we had to clean them up.</span> <span id="s193">Now Jews were not used to such kind of work, bury horses.</span> <span id="s194">They were not strong enough for this.</span> <span id="s195">So we had to dig holes and pull the horses and bury them because we were afraid of an epidemic.</span> <span id="s196">And so there were a case I remember that one Jew when we dug the horses, one officer came and he said to the Jew he didn't [like] him for some reason or other.</span> <span id="s197">And he said to go in in the hole with the horse and we had to burn him too alive.</span> <span id="s198">And we started to cover and with the dirt.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Then in the last minute his wife found out and she came and she screamed and begged and cried.</span> <span id="s200">Finally, he was almost buried completely.</span> <span id="s201">He said, "Alright, you can dig him out.”</span> <span id="s202">In those [days] they started to harass the Jews.</span> <span id="s203">They used to take old Jews with long beards and they used to harness them to wagons, and they used to sit on the wagons and they used to pull them.</span> <span id="s204">Just to show and make pictures and make a film.</span> <span id="s205">Everything to insult.</span> <span id="s206">In the beginning those insults were very bad, because we didn't know what awaits us.</span> <span id="s207">But everyday something else happened.</span> <span id="s208">And we got used to the yesterday's insults, but the next day there were more severe insults.</span> <span id="s209">So we forgot already what happened yesterday because we had to cope with the new one.</span> <span id="s210">And then later they gave out the curfew that Jews can only walk out from their houses between 10 in the morning til 12 noon, and then from 4 in the afternoon till 6.</span> <span id="s211">So you imagine only for the 2 hours to go out and to do everything what you had to do for the family.</span> <span id="s212">Naturally, nobody did business anymore.</span> <span id="s213">They confiscated the merchandise.</span> <span id="s214">They took away everything.</span> <span id="s215">And in the 2 hours you could see everybody was running, running, running because you wanted to do, to accomplish in the 2 hours what he could do in a whole day.</span> <span id="s216">And then later he was in a hurry to go home, not to be caught in the middle.</span> <span id="s217">So those were the harassments.</span> <span id="s218">Then later it came the harassments which couldn't walk on the sidewalk.</span> <span id="s219">We had to walk on the road, on the street.</span> <span id="s220">The first day it was terrible.</span> <span id="s221">What you mean I cannot walk on the sidewalk?</span> <span id="s222">But later we got used to it.</span> <span id="s223">We got used to it, so we walked on the street and if somebody walked on the sidewalk in the beginning they didn't shoot us, but they arrested them.</span> <span id="s224">Then later came out a order that every Jew who saw a German on the street had to take off his hat.</span> <span id="s225">He had to greet him.</span> <span id="s226">Now, so they were cases like in my father for instance, I remember, there came a young German policeman, so he took off his hat.</span> <span id="s227">So he went to him.</span> <span id="s228">He started to beat him up.</span> <span id="s229">And he beat him up and he said, "Why do you beat me?"</span> <span id="s230">He says, "Well, because why you taking off the hat.</span> <span id="s231">Why you greeting me?</span> <span id="s232">What am I?</span> <span id="s233">Your friend?</span> <span id="s234">You are a dirty, lousy Jew and I'm a German.</span> <span id="s235">Why am I your friend.</span> <span id="s236">Why you greeting me?"</span> <span id="s237">So the next day, when he saw a German, he didn't take off the hat.</span> <span id="s238">So he went and he beat him up.</span> <span id="s239">And he said, "How long do we have to teach you when you see a German you should take off up your hat, take off your hat and bow because you are subhuman and.....</span> <span id="s240">So everything what they did, it was only to make life miserable.</span> <span id="s241">And then the war, of course, very bad because every day they caught the same people and they took them away to all kind of work, to clean the streets.</span> <span id="s242">And then the Poles were standing and laughing and enjoying because they didn't touch them and they were very[helpful?]</span> <span id="s243">and if sometimes the Germans didn't know where the Jews lived, the Poles...usually the young Polish boys used to go with the Germans.</span> <span id="s244">They couldn't speak German.</span> <span id="s245">One word they learned very fast.</span> <span id="s246">Jude.</span> <span id="s247">Jude.</span> <span id="s248">So they went with the Germans and they used to show the houses.</span> <span id="s249">Jude.</span> <span id="s250">Jude.</span> <span id="s251">Jude.</span> <span id="s252">That there lives a Jew.</span> <span id="s253">So the Germans went in and took out everybody and dragged them to work.</span> <span id="s254">Now the work was done and they didn't pay for it.</span> <span id="s255">The people were hungry.</span> <span id="s256">They couldn't make a few zlotys in their profession or something like this.</span> <span id="s257">They had to go from morning til night to work.</span> <span id="s258">And the worst time was in the winter.</span> <span id="s259">In the winter we had to clear the streets.</span> <span id="s260">From far away, kilometers away, for the Germans that their cars and trucks should be able to travel.</span> <span id="s261">So we had to stay in the snow from morning til night.</span> <span id="s262">Even when the snow was falling down, we still had to clean.</span> <span id="s263">So we sometimes asked, "What's the use to clean up?</span> <span id="s264">In 5 minutes they will be covered with snow again?"</span> <span id="s265">But nevertheless, we had to do it.</span> <span id="s266">And I was with the Germans about a month.</span> <span id="s267">Then something happened to my father, somebody, one of his friends denounced him to the Germans that we had hidden merchandise and the Germans took away everything we had from our warehouses.</span> <span id="s268">They cleared out everything.</span> <span id="s269">They didn't leave anything.</span> <span id="s270">And I said to this man...I threatened him and I said to him, "Someday, I will pay you back for it.”</span> <span id="s271">And he went to the Germans and he told them that I'm a very dangerous.</span> <span id="s272">I was at this time 19 years old.</span> <span id="s273">I was a boy from the Yeshiva from a Rabbinical school.</span> <span id="s274">Before the war, I wore the long peijes.</span> <span id="s275">And he told them that I belonged before the war to a communist party which was against...and that I'm dangerous to the Germans, and I also said that I will go and to do some sabotage.</span> <span id="s276">This what he told the Germans.</span> <span id="s277">Now, they didn't know me, so they said that tomorrow we're gonna arrest him and we shoot him.</span> <span id="s278">I find out about it and I run away to Russia.</span> <span id="s279">To the Russia zone because Poland was divided.</span> <span id="s280">The western part was taken over by the Germans, and the eastern part was taken over by the Russians.</span> <span id="s281">So I went over to the Russian zone and I went to Lemberg [Lwow].</span> <span id="s282">And I was very happy in Lemberg because there I joined a gymnasium which I always dreamed about it.</span> <span id="s283">And I also joined a Jewish theatrical group.</span> <span id="s284">There was a Jewish theatre and I always I said, "If I cannot be a doctor, I want to be an actor.”</span> <span id="s285">I always had it in my blood.</span> <span id="s286">And even in home before the war when we used to make like plays for a holiday for Hanukkah for Purim, every year our school made the play.</span> <span id="s287">And I always had the lead in this play and I used to sing by a cantor.</span> <span id="s288">I had a voice soprano, so the cantor liked me and I used to sing solos.</span> <span id="s289">So I came to Lemberg and my dream was fulfilled.</span> <span id="s290">I went to a gymnasium and I joined a theater so I could play...be a part of it.</span> <span id="s291">So I said, "Well, the war will last maybe a year or two, and I will meanwhile do what I want to do.”</span> <span id="s292">Meanwhile, I found out, I was there 3 months.</span> <span id="s293">I find out that my girlfriend which I liked...her mother is gravely ill and she was only with her mother because her father and brother and sister were on the Russian side.</span> <span id="s294">So I find out about it.</span> <span id="s295">I decided to come home.</span> <span id="s296">And I came back to the Germans.</span> <span id="s297">And I will never forget, this was already in January.</span> <span id="s298">We had to put white sheets over us to camouflage the snow and we went through the border and we were caught.</span> <span id="s299">Those are long stories.</span> <span id="s300">I don't want to dwell on how we were caught by the Russians, and then they had to take us to jail to Lemberg, back to Russia.</span> <span id="s301">We knew once we are in the jail, so after from the jail, they send us to Siberia.</span> <span id="s302">So during the night, we overpowered the guards and we tied them down with blankets.</span> <span id="s303">We took away their rifles, and we went back to the border and this time we managed to cross the border.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: Who is... Slow down.</span> <span id="s305">We have plenty of time.</span> <span id="s306">Who is we?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: Well, there was one man.</span> <span id="s308">Before the war, he was a horse dealer.</span> <span id="s309">And he lived in the section where the border is.</span> <span id="s310">The town's name was Jarloslaw.</span> <span id="s311">It was known that every week he takes a group of people who want to go to back.</span> <span id="s312">And when we came back he took a group of people who want to run away from the German side.</span> <span id="s313">So he was like a smuggler.</span> <span id="s314">He was a Jewish man.</span> <span id="s315">And he took at this time 15 boys from our town who wanted to go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Because in the beginning they couldn't make a living in Lemberg.</span> <span id="s317">It was very bad.</span> <span id="s318">There were thousands and thousands of refugees.</span> <span id="s319">They didn't have where to live, where to sleep.</span> <span id="s320">So here somebody told us that the Jews live in their houses.</span> <span id="s321">It's bad under the Germans.</span> <span id="s322">They have to work.</span> <span id="s323">They have to do certain things.</span> <span id="s324">But the atrocities didn't start right in the beginning, so they figured they will come home.</span> <span id="s325">I came home because on account of this girl.</span> <span id="s326">Maybe subconsciously I wanted to be with the family too.</span> <span id="s327">And I will never forget the day that I came home, my father was sitting in our kitchen studying some Talmud, and I came in and he saw me and I said, "I'm back.”</span> <span id="s328">And he didn't lift his eyes.</span> <span id="s329">While looking still in the book, he said, "As much as I am happy to see you, you made the biggest mistake in your life that you came back.”</span> <span id="s330">Those were his words when he saw me when I came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">And naturally when I came back the first week, I was hiding because I was afraid that somebody would say, "The police.”</span> <span id="s332">because I remembered that they wanted me.</span> <span id="s333">But this was already new police, and nobody remembered and I joined the Jews with their misery in our town going to work and starting to do business and my father still had this little store, but it was little in this time.</span> <span id="s334">But he didn't come in in the store, because he was a Jew with a long beard and it was like a red cloth when you want to aggravate a bull.</span> <span id="s335">So my sisters were in the store and I started to travel to different towns, and brought in merchandise, mostly black market.</span> <span id="s336">And this how we started to make a living.</span> <span id="s337">And I was the young in the family, so I had to do it, and I did it to support all my sisters because I had the three married sisters.</span> <span id="s338">Their husbands were not capable to do it.</span> <span id="s339">They were very religious Jews with the beards and I was young.</span> <span id="s340">They didn't speak so good Polish.</span> <span id="s341">So I used to travel every day someplace else and to bring in merchandise and to sell it and to make money.</span> <span id="s342">And we worked like this til about spring of 1940.</span> <span id="s343">Spring of 1940, they made a registration, so all the Jews had to be registered.</span> <span id="s344">And then they used to make like...there came a few high officers from Rzeszow, and they took us in a big building and they made like a selection.</span> <span id="s345">From the people who were registered, they picked out at this time 200 young boys and we had to come to the places where trucks were waiting.</span> <span id="s346">And they send us to a labor camp.</span> <span id="s347">This was the first time they made this registration.</span> <span id="s348">And the labor camp was in a town...in a village called Leipyia.</span> <span id="s349">This was near a town Novisanz.</span> <span id="s350">This was near the southern border this was in the Carpathian mountains.</span> <span id="s351">Our work was that we had to break rocks.</span> <span id="s352">It was like a quarry where we had to break rocks, but the problem was that what we did...when we broke up the rocks we had to transport them to a place on hand wagons, on wheel barrels, and the next day we took the same rocks and we brought them back to the first place.</span> <span id="s353">And this was our work.</span> <span id="s354">It was very hard work.</span> <span id="s355">And they gave us very little food.</span> <span id="s356">But it wasn't so bad because in this time, this was in 1940, our people in our town still lived in their homes.</span> <span id="s357">They still had what to eat.</span> <span id="s358">And the post office could send...we could send packages.</span> <span id="s359">So the community from our town used to send every week a package to every prisoner.</span> <span id="s360">And they send it to the community of Novasanz, of this town.</span> <span id="s361">And this Jewish community brought it us to the camp.</span> <span id="s362">So we had enough.</span> <span id="s363">After 2 or 3 months, we started to run away.</span> <span id="s364">And all of us run away.</span> <span id="s365">And the Germans didn't even look for us even run away.</span> <span id="s366">What did they do?</span> <span id="s367">When everybody run away, they had from different towns, also young people, so they went to other town and brought in other transport.</span> <span id="s368">So they didn't bother looking for us.</span> <span id="s369">So I came back from this camp and I started to work by the Germans.</span> <span id="s370">So they took me and we started to build garages for the Wehrmacht.</span> <span id="s371">And they accepted me.</span> <span id="s372">They also made us register, they looked us over who is young and strong, so because of my work.</span> <span id="s373">So everyday I went to work.</span> <span id="s374">They didn't pay us for the work, but I was glad to go to work for them so they wouldn't catch me to work different work like cleaning the streets, cleaning the buildings.</span> <span id="s375">Because I had to go work anyways.</span> <span id="s376">At least I went in the morning.</span> <span id="s377">I had a pass that nobody should grab me from the street.</span> <span id="s378">And we worked there.</span> <span id="s379">And once being with those Germans or working in the garages, so I used to buy for them a quart of kerosene, a loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s380">I used to bring to the Germans a few eggs, and we exchanged this.</span> <span id="s381">And it was there where I worked.</span> <span id="s382">And sisters were in the store, and they did some business buying this from peasants and selling some produce.</span> <span id="s383">It was not like before the war, but we thought it is bad, but somehow we will survive.</span> <span id="s384">They didn't kill at this time.</span> <span id="s385">But Jews for every little things were arrested.</span> <span id="s386">They were harassed.</span> <span id="s387">And they caught the slaughter the Shochet who used to slaughter for a kosher meat, so they arrested him.</span> <span id="s388">After 2 weeks, they paid a lot of ransom...they paid money, they let him out.</span> <span id="s389">And everything was done with money, you could buy yourself out by the German police.</span> <span id="s390">And we still lived in our houses, so it wasn't so bad.</span> <span id="s391">But we knew that we are under German occupation, and also we heard stories from other towns about atrocities.</span> <span id="s392">There was a town Mielec, for instance, not far from my town, so when the Germans came in, they took about 200 Jews and they put them in in the shul, in the temple, and also in the public bath and they closed the doors and they burned the people with the buildings.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: Do you see that?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: No.</span> <span id="s395">No.</span> <span id="s396">No.</span> <span id="s397">This I didn't see, but this was in the next town.</span> <span id="s398">So we heard about atrocities from different towns, but they asked...it was just arresting contribution...we had to pay money, but nothing terrible happened.</span> <span id="s399">Until in the fall of 1940, they came, they established a very notorious camp near us named Pruszkow, and Pruszkow was an SS camp.</span> <span id="s400">Now Pruszkow was established because this was the place where they started experiments for the V-1, V-2, rockets.</span> <span id="s401">This is the first what they did it, and they picked out this place because there were a lot of woods.</span> <span id="s402">In Poland, there was a section, it was called Pushun Sandomerska .</span> <span id="s403">It means the wilderness of Sandomierz, the town.</span> <span id="s404">Before the 18th century practically, nobody could go through it.</span> <span id="s405">It was old, virgin forest.</span> <span id="s406">Later, people started to make villages, towns.</span> <span id="s407">In this section of Pruszkow Sandomerzko, they made the first experiments.</span> <span id="s408">They brought in Jews and Poles too, and they worked there for a certain time.</span> <span id="s409">Later, they killed the people.</span> <span id="s410">They were afraid that they would run away and they would start to tell stories about those experiments.</span> <span id="s411">I remember that during the day, three or four times you could hear a boom, a noise, but you didn't see a airplane.</span> <span id="s412">You didn't see anything.</span> <span id="s413">You could hear it.</span> <span id="s414">It sound like something is flying then noise, then it was an explosion in the air.</span> <span id="s415">You could see a ball of fire and it disappeared.</span> <span id="s416">And this happened a few times a days, so this were the experiments that they used to shoot the rockets, but they exploded.</span> <span id="s417">Then later when the rockets exploded, then on the places pieces of cast aluminum used to fall on the ground.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Now the peasants used to collect it and they used to make utensils, spoons, jars, cups, everything they used to make from this.</span> <span id="s419">So the Germans didn't want it should be, and they used to send out special police to go and collect those items.</span> <span id="s420">And this came from Pruszkow.</span> <span id="s421">So in 1941, at the end of 40, I was taken to Pruszkow.</span> <span id="s422">Again, there came a commission, and they took the young people and they looked through and while they picked out the people, they beat up everybody.</span> <span id="s423">And I remember I was beaten up terrible.</span> <span id="s424">I was standing in line, then somebody and I didn't move so fast, so SS men with their rifle butt hit me in the back and I flew to the front and I feel down and I was all bleeding.</span> <span id="s425">So the man who was in charge, his name was Schmidt.</span> <span id="s426">He was a Feldwebel, I mean a Scharfuhrer from the SS.</span> <span id="s427">And he saw me on the floor, so they picked me up, and I was bleeding from my mouth, from my nose.</span> <span id="s428">So he came out and he said, "Hey, what happened to you?"</span> <span id="s429">Like not...he joked around.</span> <span id="s430">So he took out a handkerchief and he gave the handkerchief I should wipe the blood.</span> <span id="s431">So I wiped the blood.</span> <span id="s432">He said, "Now, clean my boots.”</span> <span id="s433">So with my blood, I had to take and I had to wipe his boots with the blood.”</span> <span id="s434">So those were the things that they were terrible in this time, but looking back those were things that you could survive.</span> <span id="s435">They were terrible, but it was not extermination.</span> <span id="s436">It was not killing off everybody.</span> <span id="s437">But in this time, those were the bad things.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">So I was taken to Pruszkow.</span> <span id="s439">They were so vicious that when they took us on open trucks and they took in this maybe 100 from our town in the open trucks, when we traveled, they took us by the trucks to Pruszkow.</span> <span id="s440">The driver purposefully, in Poland on the road, on both sides, there were trees.</span> <span id="s441">Now trees were not high so he purposely drove the truck under the trees where the branches were sticking out and the people should be hurt, and a few of them were hurt.</span> <span id="s442">It cut open their heads and all that because the truck went in the branches.</span> <span id="s443">I was in Pruszkow about 6 weeks.</span> <span id="s444">During the time, every night was there a ritual.</span> <span id="s445">When there was the appell, this Schmidt picked out somebody and he was hanged.</span> <span id="s446">We all had to watch by the appell how the man was hanged.</span> <span id="s447">And usually he picked out somebody of us, and he was the hangman.</span> <span id="s448">Now there were times in the books that I am writing there and I give more details, so there was a times that he picked somebody who didn't want to hang the other Jew.</span> <span id="s449">So he took a knife and he cut his throat because he didn't want to hang him.</span> <span id="s450">And also this Schmidt had a habit, when we walked to work we cut trees because they wanted to make the camp a little larger, so he used to shoot just in our rank, in our column.</span> <span id="s451">Not aiming.</span> <span id="s452">So once I was hit in my right arm.</span> <span id="s453">And it was very difficult to work because the hand, but he didn't do no damage and I with somebody's help, I was transferred to other detail to put up telephone poles through the town of Tarnow.</span> <span id="s454">And one time when I lifted a telephone pole, I dislocated a disc in my neck and I couldn't straighten out.</span> <span id="s455">And then I knew that if I would be there and they would find out that this happen, they would shoot me because what do they need a man with a dislocated disc?</span> <span id="s456">And then with the help of somebody I escaped, and I came back home.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">01:40</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: Let's back up again.</span> <span id="s459">Tell us, again...slow down.</span> <span id="s460">Tell us how you escaped.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A: Well, when I was shot, so the Germans, they didn't know would be tied down to 1, 10 men.</span> <span id="s462">I went to work.</span> <span id="s463">It was hard too, because we worked there cutting the trees.</span> <span id="s464">So it was hard, but with the help with others, they covered me.</span> <span id="s465">You know, in a camp the comradeship, the friendship was so big that everybody would do everything for his friend.</span> <span id="s466">Even we were strangers we became so friendly that at times even they would endanger their lives to help their other friend.</span> <span id="s467">So they covered, but when I dislocated a disc it was very bad for me.</span> <span id="s468">I used to hold on to two guys when we worked I should be a little straight.</span> <span id="s469">And I knew that I would not be able to hide this a long time.</span> <span id="s470">So there was a man who was in charge of the Jewish columns.</span> <span id="s471">It so happens that this man was a cousin of my girlfriend.</span> <span id="s472">And I told him this.</span> <span id="s473">His name was Kleinhandler from Tarnow.</span> <span id="s474">And he was the head, he was like a middle man between the workers of Tarnow in this Pruszkow camp.</span> <span id="s475">So through him, he recommended me to somebody else and through the other man helped me to escape.</span> <span id="s476">He opened a truck when I went to work...a truck went to a town Bembitza .</span> <span id="s477">And he told me to go on the truck, and they took me away.</span> <span id="s478">Because the truck was a SS truck, but he had to pick out so many workers to go to this town so he picked me out.</span> <span id="s479">He knew that I have his name, I remember even was Immergluck .</span> <span id="s480">And he was not very much liked, because he did things that he didn't have to do to the Jewish workers.</span> <span id="s481">But to me, he was good because this other friend told him to do it, so he picked me up and they helped me go on the truck and they took me to work supposedly to the Bembitza to bring some merchandise or to bring some supplies.</span> <span id="s482">So I went to Bembitza, the Jews were still there, so I didn't go back.</span> <span id="s483">And that's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">They didn't look for me.</span> <span id="s485">I came home and I started to wear a brace.</span> <span id="s486">And then later after a few weeks, it healed.</span> <span id="s487">I had problems later, but I could walk out.</span> <span id="s488">I came back home.</span> <span id="s489">The situation started to be much worse, every day, every day, you could see that the situation is worse.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Then later we received, we got in our town a Land Kommissar which is the head of the county, because our town was the county seat, and there came a Land commissar, and his name was Farting.</span> <span id="s491">And he was the biggest sadist ever lived.</span> <span id="s492">And he was a German, but he also was a Polish guy, because he spoke German and Polish.</span> <span id="s493">And this was very bad, because he could speak to the Polish people and he could find out a lot of things which was not healthy for us.</span> <span id="s494">So this Farding came to us as a LandKommissar.</span> <span id="s495">Before he used to be in the Gestapo in Rzeszow.</span> <span id="s496">So they said and we used to say he is so bad because he has all bad things from both nations, the bad things from the Germans and the bad things from the Poles, and he combined it in one person.</span> <span id="s497">He looked like a caricature.</span> <span id="s498">He was short, very fat, with a big belly, a shaved head which in the sun it was gleaming like a mirror, small little eyes like a pig, very small piercing eyes, and he had a voice that it was like a shrilled voice, like it came from animal or something, very shrill you say, and he was very shrewd, very smart.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">And he wanted to outsmart everybody, but he was very vicious.</span> <span id="s500">So when he came he organized a ghetto in our town.</span> <span id="s501">And our ghetto was organized before large towns had ghetto because we already had a ghetto in June 1941, which was very early.</span> <span id="s502">And he pushed into the ghetto, where before used to be 70 Poles, he put in 2,000.</span> <span id="s503">And it was very cramped.</span> <span id="s504">And we lived in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s505">And then we had an old man who was the President of the Judenrat, which was a Doctor Unterman.</span> <span id="s506">And I think this Doctor Unterman should be remembered.</span> <span id="s507">If the Jews would have in their religion to make a saint of somebody, I think he should have been the first saint.</span> <span id="s508">Because being that president of the Judenrat, he actually sacrificed his life for the Jews.</span> <span id="s509">Before the war, this Doctor Unterman didn't consider himself a Jew.</span> <span id="s510">He was a assimilated Jew.</span> <span id="s511">He never bothered with Jews.</span> <span id="s512">He never belonged to a temple.</span> <span id="s513">He never even stepped in a Jewish temple.</span> <span id="s514">Only had his friends with the Polish people because he was a Polish officer, and was a Polish patriot, and he was considered by them that he was one of the most important people in our town.</span> <span id="s515">But with Jews he never had anything to do.</span> <span id="s516">He had Jewish, had Jewish patients, but that's all.</span> <span id="s517">When the war started he saw that he can speak to the Germans different than a Jew with a long beard.</span> <span id="s518">He was clean shaven.</span> <span id="s519">He was a captain in the Austrian army.</span> <span id="s520">He</span></p> <p><span id="s521">01:46:40 studied medicine in Vienna, spoke beautiful German, and he could stand up to them.</span> <span id="s522">Now, again, he couldn't understand that the Germans will be so vicious and he thought with him they will think twice.</span> <span id="s523">So he agreed to become the president, which before he said, "What I have nothing to do with Jews?"</span> <span id="s524">But later, we convinced him and he said he will become president if he would pick out 12 people which he liked with him.</span> <span id="s525">And he picked out 12 younger people, Jews without beards, people who were outstanding citizens before the war.</span> <span id="s526">Honest people.</span> <span id="s527">Fine people.</span> <span id="s528">And he said, "If they will be with me in the Judenrat, then I will be come the Hauptman.</span> <span id="s529">And they agreed.</span> <span id="s530">As a matter of fact, between the 12 people, he picked out my older brother and my brother-in-law he was one of the 12.</span> <span id="s531">And he ran this Judenrot that I don't think so that any Judenrot was run like this.</span> <span id="s532">He was so honest.</span> <span id="s533">I don't know if we should go in details, but Linda, I'll give you two examples.</span> <span id="s534">Once they brought in, they gave to the Jews to divide pieces of soap, to give every family a piece of soap.</span> <span id="s535">And the Judenrat divided the soap.</span> <span id="s536">And then about 5 kilo soap was left.</span> <span id="s537">It was more than they...so the Judenrat, the man who was in charge of dividing the soap, he made 13 packages to give what's left over to each member of the Judenrat to take home.</span> <span id="s538">And one was for Dr.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Unterman.</span> <span id="s540">And Dr. Unterman came in, and they said, "This is for you.”</span> <span id="s541">He said, "What is it?"</span> <span id="s542">He said, "Well, this is the soap.”</span> <span id="s543">He says, "But I already got soap, what I suppose to get.”</span> <span id="s544">"Well, this was left.”</span> <span id="s545">And they explained it.</span> <span id="s546">And he said, "It was left and how much?"</span> <span id="s547">And they said, "We made 13 packages.”</span> <span id="s548">He said, "I want to see the 13 packages.”</span> <span id="s549">So they brought back what everybody took for himself.</span> <span id="s550">He opened it and he said, "Give me a list of 13 poorest Jews in our town.”</span> <span id="s551">So they picked out 13 poor Jews.</span> <span id="s552">"I want everybody should get a package.</span> <span id="s553">Not you.</span> <span id="s554">Not I.” And he divided...this kind of man way he was.</span> <span id="s555">Like to the Germans he spoke to them like to equals.</span> <span id="s556">Like this Farding who came in, he wanted to take over Unterman's house because he built this house a year before the war.</span> <span id="s557">And because he was a physician he was well off.</span> <span id="s558">And he built a beautiful house, and this was the only house in our town that had electricity.</span> <span id="s559">He had his own generator.</span> <span id="s560">The only one in town that he had indoor plumbing.</span> <span id="s561">He made it a beautiful house.</span> <span id="s562">So naturally, Farding wanted this house.</span> <span id="s563">So he asked him, "I want to move in.</span> <span id="s564">Why don't you move in into the ghetto.”</span> <span id="s565">So he told him, "In the ghetto I will move in til the last Jew will have a roof over his head.</span> <span id="s566">So long as the last Jew doesn't have a roof over his head, I will not move in.”</span> <span id="s567">Then later this Farding said, "The Judenrat will have to pay 10,000 zlotys to me to renovate the house.”</span> <span id="s568">He said, "Renovate?</span> <span id="s569">I just built it.</span> <span id="s570">And besides if I could live in it, you can live in it.</span> <span id="s571">And then why should you renovate.</span> <span id="s572">After the war will end, I will come back to my house.</span> <span id="s573">You will go back to Germany.”</span> <span id="s574">Now he didn't like this thing, we were in the ghetto about 2 weeks, he took the whole Judenrat with Dr. Unterman and he arrested them and they were sitting in jail in Kolbuszowa about a week or 2 weeks.</span> <span id="s575">They they were sent to Rzeszow and from Rzeszowize they were sent to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s576">In Auschwitz, there were orders was right in the beginning.</span> <span id="s577">This was in the fall of 1941.</span> <span id="s578">In this time, you hardly knew that Auschwitz exists.</span> <span id="s579">And then they were sent to Auschwitz, and after 2, 3 weeks, telegrams started to come to the families, and the telegram said that your husband died on cancer.</span> <span id="s580">Other one your husband died on heart attack.</span> <span id="s581">Your husband died while he was running away.</span> <span id="s582">And then it was a letter that the widow had to sign that her husband suffered for cancer for 2 years, that her husband had heart trouble for 4 years.</span> <span id="s583">Why they did it, why this evidence they needed, I don't know.</span> <span id="s584">But they had to sign a letter that he actually was sickly and to add salt to the wound, everybody received a bill for the cremation.</span> <span id="s585">They said people were cremated and the cremation cost so and so much, and you will have to pay the money.</span> <span id="s586">So every widow had to pay money for the cremation.</span> <span id="s587">Now when the Judenrot was liquidated, naturally, Fardring organized a new Judenrot.</span> <span id="s588">But [for] this Judenrat he already picked out people who he liked.</span> <span id="s589">And this Judenrat, I wouldn't say that they were murderers, but they were more to the liking of the Germans than Dr. Unterman.</span> <span id="s590">That the old man of this Judenrat wouldn't go out and wouldn't, if there was left there 13 packages of soap, he wouldn't say divide it to the poor.</span> <span id="s591">He probably would say I want the whole 13 packages.</span> <span id="s592">This was a different.</span> <span id="s593">And then it was life started to be more and more terrible.</span> <span id="s594">Another [thing] I want to tell you about is Dr.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Unterman.</span> <span id="s596">When he saw that the Jews are so poor and they cannot afford a doctor, so he organized an ambulatorium.</span> <span id="s597">And every day he gave 2 hours, he was sitting in the ambulatorium, and this was in my sister's apartment, and everybody who was sick who couldn't pay could come to him, and he treated the people.</span> <span id="s598">And then later the Judenrat had to pay for medicine what they received.</span> <span id="s599">Because he liked me, so he took me in the ambulatorium I should be his assistant.</span> <span id="s600">As I mentioned before, I always wanted to be a doctor.</span> <span id="s601">So I worked with him and he taught me how to open wounds, how to clean wounds, how to put in all kinds of ointments, how to bandage, all those things.</span> <span id="s602">And I worked with him every day and he showed me all these things.</span> <span id="s603">This gave me opportunity when we were later in our camp, which we come to it, and we were in the woods I became the doctor, the so-called doctor.</span> <span id="s604">We had to do some medically, I always had that little suitcase with all kind of instruments which I inherited after he was killed.</span> <span id="s605">And I had this and I used to treat the people as much as I could, as much as he taught me.</span> <span id="s606">So this Doctor Unterman got killed, and the Judenrat got killed.</span> <span id="s607">He had a wife with a son, and his wife, after he was arrested, the wife with the son escaped to Warsaw and they lived as Aryans, illegal people, Poles, illegal papers which they could very easily survive because they didn't look Jewish, and their language was only Polish.</span> <span id="s608">And during the uprising, not the ghetto uprising, but the general uprising in Warsaw, her son was a officer of the AK, the Polish underground, and he was killed.</span> <span id="s609">She survived and came to America, and after the war and since then she died.</span> <span id="s610">So men like this should be remembered because we didn't have too many people like this.</span> <span id="s611">Actually, the Poles begged him to escape from jail in Kolbuszowa, and they wanted to take him and hide him and do anything for him.</span> <span id="s612">And he said, "I cannot do it, because I cannot leave the Jews, because nobody will stick up for them.”</span> <span id="s613">And he thought that he would be able to speak up, and then later they got rid of him.</span> <span id="s614">Now once he was killed yes, also under his administration, because you asked me I should tell about me.</span> <span id="s615">Because I before the war, I</span></p> <p><span id="s616">01:55 worked in my father's store and I used to go to different towns buying all kind of merchandise for our store, I knew the suppliers.</span> <span id="s617">I knew the ways how to buy and bring in the stuff.</span> <span id="s618">And also when I left our ghetto, we had to wear the arm band, a white arm band with a blue star of David.</span> <span id="s619">Every time I left the ghetto, the first thing I took off my arm band.</span> <span id="s620">And I traveled, nobody stopped me and it so happens that I was never, never stopped for questioning that I'm a Jew.</span> <span id="s621">I look so Polish, more than the Polish people.</span> <span id="s622">So I never was suspected, so it was easy for me to go because and then later to bring in merchandise as a non-Jew.</span> <span id="s623">So Unterman picked me out and I was the one who used to go to different towns and to bring in merchandise for the ghetto.</span> <span id="s624">Now, we later organized a kitchen for the people to come in to have a warm meal once a day.</span> <span id="s625">Now when we had to buy those things we didn't receive as for the ghetto on card, but we had to buy like potatoes, flour and other things.</span> <span id="s626">So I used to go out to the peasants and used to buy it and bring it in.</span> <span id="s627">And I did it for the Judenrat.</span> <span id="s628">Now, also the ghetto received flour for baking bread, and each family received so much.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Sometimes two</span></p> <p><span id="s630">01:57: loaves a week, sometimes 1 loaf a week.</span> <span id="s631">This had to brought in.</span> <span id="s632">So I used to go to the flour mills and bring it in.</span> <span id="s633">This was officially I brought it in.</span> <span id="s634">We used to get sugar.</span> <span id="s635">We used to get marmalade.</span> <span id="s636">We used to get other things...supplies what the Germans get.</span> <span id="s637">And this we used to get in Rzeszow.</span> <span id="s638">So I went twice a week, once a week, with wagons and I brought this in and this was my job.</span> <span id="s639">Instead to go and work on the streets and clean the streets, so this was my job that Unterman assigned me to.</span> <span id="s640">And for me, it was very good because when I went to buy all those things, I always brought something on the black market.</span> <span id="s641">Paid extra money, and together with this merchandise, I could bring it in and then later to supply my family and to sell something like this.</span> <span id="s642">This went on til he was arrested.</span> <span id="s643">When the new old man [Aeltester] .</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s645">This is a good place to stop and break and change tapes.</span> <span id="s646">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: You were telling us about you bringing in the supplies in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: So when the second Judenrat came into power...meanwhile, we had all kind of new orders.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Orders like to give up all the furs, and if somebody would have a fur, and they would be caught with a piece of fur in the ghetto and would be shot.</span> <span id="s651">So naturally most of the Jews gave the Germans the furs.</span> <span id="s652">I remember there came a truck.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: Gave them what?</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: Fur.</span> <span id="s655">Fur.</span> <span id="s656">Fur.</span> <span id="s657">And then they had collars and fur, they gave them.</span> <span id="s658">And it was not a rich town, so you could see somebody had there a coat with a fur lining, it was maybe a 100 years [old] or so.</span> <span id="s659">It was all falling apart.</span> <span id="s660">But they brought it over.</span> <span id="s661">Everybody was afraid.</span> <span id="s662">Some younger woman had Persian Lamb coats because this was the style.</span> <span id="s663">So some didn't give the Persian Lamb coats because it was valuable, so we used to hide it or give it to peasants to hide.</span> <span id="s664">I remember one of my sisters had a Persian Lamb coat, so she gave it to me and I brought it out from the ghetto to somebody who we trusted and they should hide it for us, which by the way they never gave it back to us.</span> <span id="s665">And then there were other contributions.</span> <span id="s666">Once this Farding came in and he said he wants to have 10 kilo of gold.</span> <span id="s667">Ten kilo of gold in our town...they were poor Jews...how could they could, but I knew how.</span> <span id="s668">But this new president from the Judenrot, his name was Pashek Rappaport.</span> <span id="s669">He was very energetic.</span> <span id="s670">And people were sometimes afraid of him.</span> <span id="s671">So he somehow managed to get together the 10 kilo gold to give it to Farding.</span> <span id="s672">And when they gave it to Farding, so he said, "You know, you saved 20 Jewish lives with it because I was prepared to kill 20 people if you wouldn't give that 20 kilo gold.”</span> <span id="s673">I remember to the gold, everybody gave what he had, a wedding band, a pair of earrings, but 10 kilo is a lot.</span> <span id="s674">So I remember there was still missing, this night I will never forget that my father came and he brought a package and he opened it and he had there, he said I'm going to give this too to save lives, so he opened it and there was a gold watch on a long chain like in this time the women used to wear a gold chain with a watch and also he had in this package a cigarette box from gold.</span> <span id="s675">So he said, "I'm going to give it.</span> <span id="s676">You see when I was engaged with your mother," he told me, "I gave her this watch, and she gave me this cigarette and I saved it through the first world war.</span> <span id="s677">I had it hidden, and now I'm going to give it.”</span> <span id="s678">And he gave it.</span> <span id="s679">And now the Jews gave...and we came up with the 10 kilo gold and then he said we saved so many lives.</span> <span id="s680">And every day new atrocities a new one on top of one [that] was not finished, the other came up.</span> <span id="s681">The other came up.</span> <span id="s682">We lived in this time in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s683">We were fortunate that my brother's apartment was in the ghetto, so we could move into his, so he had two rooms, so we moved in in one room and he had one room.</span> <span id="s684">I had three married sisters, so one of my sisters lived in the place where the ghetto was with the other two sisters moved in.</span> <span id="s685">So somehow I was appointed by the new Judenrot to my old job to go to other towns and to bring in the merchandise which was very helpful.</span> <span id="s686">But in December of 1941, I went once to Rzeszow, and Rzeszowi was a epidemic of dysentery.</span> <span id="s687">And a lot of people died.</span> <span id="s688">And I ate there.</span> <span id="s689">I remember I bought two tomatoes, and I ate the two tomatoes and I came home and I had dysentery.</span> <span id="s690">And this was very dangerous because with the Germans, because this was very contagious and when the Germans find out that there is somebody with dysentery, probably they would have me killed.</span> <span id="s691">So we didn't tell nobody.</span> <span id="s692">I went to the attic, and my younger sister which was the dearest to me because we were the closest in age.</span> <span id="s693">She was 3 years older.</span> <span id="s694">Her name was Rachel.</span> <span id="s695">And we decided I would be on the attic.</span> <span id="s696">We wouldn't tell nobody, and she was with me during all the time.</span> <span id="s697">She used to give me food, what I could eat, and she used to take away from me what was necessary because it had to buried because the Germans.</span> <span id="s698">And I somehow survived this dysentery.</span> <span id="s699">We didn't have no injections.</span> <span id="s700">We didn't have no doctor.</span> <span id="s701">And as I recuperated I got middle ear infection, and</span></p> <p><span id="s702">02:05:30 I started to have terrible pain.</span> <span id="s703">And, again, no doctor so home remedies.</span> <span id="s704">We used to put in oil and this and that and it went on and on and got worse and worse and worse.</span> <span id="s705">And after 3 weeks, the pains were so terrible, I cannot describe the pains because everything was infected.</span> <span id="s706">So this was in the winter.</span> <span id="s707">Somehow my brother got a sleigh with somebody, and they took me out from the ghetto, and they brought me to the ghetto in Rzeszow, to Dr.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Heller.</span> <span id="s709">He was a .</span> <span id="s710">It was a specialist for ear, throat and nose.</span> <span id="s711">And he said that I have to have an operation right away.</span> <span id="s712">If I wouldn't have operation, I would die because all the puss was around the brain, but he cannot operate.</span> <span id="s713">There is no facilities.</span> <span id="s714">There are no Jewish hospital in Rzeszow, and I cannot go to a non-Jewish hospital.</span> <span id="s715">So I went there with my sisters.</span> <span id="s716">I was there with my sisters.</span> <span id="s717">So I have to go to Krakow.</span> <span id="s718">How can you go to Krakow?</span> <span id="s719">Jews are not permitted to ride by train.</span> <span id="s720">So my brother went back to Kolbuszowa and somehow he managed to get a false...from this Rappaport some that he had, a pass signed by this Farding, by this Land Kommissar, but it was not made out to nobody, so he made out my name with my sisters and they took me, with the train, to Krakow.</span> <span id="s721">On the train, a young Polish boy came up and he saw that there are three Jews, my two sisters and myself.</span> <span id="s722">He said, "What are Jews doing on the train?"</span> <span id="s723">He said, "I'm coming now from Germany.</span> <span id="s724">I work in Germany.</span> <span id="s725">In Germany, they wouldn't allow Jews on the train.”</span> <span id="s726">And he started to speak to the rest of the people.</span> <span id="s727">He said, "We cannot have Jews on the train.</span> <span id="s728">We have to throw them out.”</span> <span id="s729">And they came to us and they wanted to throw us out from the running train.</span> <span id="s730">So my sister started to cry and to beg.</span> <span id="s731">They said, "Look this man...this boy is almost dead.</span> <span id="s732">He's so sick.</span> <span id="s733">He needs an operations.”</span> <span id="s734">My head was all with bandages.</span> <span id="s735">So some people they said, "Well, Let's...let's wait til a station.”</span> <span id="s736">There was a station.</span> <span id="s737">So this man went down.</span> <span id="s738">He brought up two policemen, German policemen, and he said, "I want you should throw them down because they are Jews.”</span> <span id="s739">So we showed him the papers.</span> <span id="s740">So the policeman said, "What...we cannot do anything.</span> <span id="s741">They have the Passier Schein.”</span> <span id="s742">That means they have a pass for travel.</span> <span id="s743">So again they started to yell, "Oh, we don't want to travel with Jews.</span> <span id="s744">So we will throw them out.”</span> <span id="s745">Again the same story, and my sisters begged them so they said okay.</span> <span id="s746">We'll not throw you out, but the next stop you have to go out.</span> <span id="s747">So we had to choice.</span> <span id="s748">The next stop.</span> <span id="s749">Meanwhile, they caught the other Jew, and they threw him out from the running station.</span> <span id="s750">Not the Germans, the Poles.</span> <span id="s751">So the next station we stopped.</span> <span id="s752">So happens that it was in Tarnow.</span> <span id="s753">And Tarnow was quite a big town.</span> <span id="s754">I knew Tarnow because I went to the Yeshiva in Tarnow, and we had there a cousin.</span> <span id="s755">We came to the cousin and we were very lucky that in Tarnow there was a doctor.</span> <span id="s756">His name was David Rabinowitz.</span> <span id="s757">And this David Rabinowitz, he was the chief surgeon in Lodz in a hospital in the name of Poznanski, a very rich manufacturer.</span> <span id="s758">And he was thrown out from Lodz and he came to Tarnow.</span> <span id="s759">So we came to him, and he looked at me and he said, "I don't think so we can do anything to this boy because it's too long.</span> <span id="s760">Everything is already full with puss.”</span> <span id="s761">But anyway, they made an operation.</span> <span id="s762">The operation took 8 hours, and he operated and he said, "Well, he will be deaf or blind or something or he will die.”</span> <span id="s763">But anyway, he operated so that after 3, 4 weeks my hearing came back and when he operated he even cut the drum for the puss to come out, and then later he sew it.</span> <span id="s764">He was a wonderful man and I became alright and I came home with my head all bandaged and in our town they already spoke about it that I'm dead already.</span> <span id="s765">Now I want to tell you what happened to this David Rabinowitz.</span> <span id="s766">He was such a wonderful surgeon, such a wonderful man;a Jewish doctor couldn't operate on a Gentile.</span> <span id="s767">But there was a case that somebody was very sick on the same thing and there was not a Polish doctor he should do this operation because it was a very delicate operation.</span> <span id="s768">They came to him, and he told them, "I cannot operate on a non-Jew.”</span> <span id="s769">So they said, "Listen, you have to save this man.”</span> <span id="s770">He went and he operated.”</span> <span id="s771">And he saved him.</span> <span id="s772">About a week later, a brother-in-law of the man who was operated...a Polish guy also, went to the Germans and he told them that this Rabinowitz operated on his brother-in-law.</span> <span id="s773">They came to the hospital, and from the hospital they they dragged him out to the yard, and they shot him.</span> <span id="s774">They shot him because he operated a non-Jew.</span> <span id="s775">And he saved him.</span> <span id="s776">Well, those were the times.</span> <span id="s777">So when I came home, the whole situation in Kolbuszowa was already different.</span> <span id="s778">During the 3 months, everything was pushed toward the end and we didn't know in this time that are</span></p> <p><span id="s779">02:11:30 death camps, gas chambers.</span> <span id="s780">This was in April 1942, and this time you didn't have any transports yet, but we could feel from the Germans' behavior that every day something else came up.</span> <span id="s781">When I came back so I got back my job.</span> <span id="s782">Instead to go to work, I got back my job to go for merchandise from the other towns, and I got the pass.</span> <span id="s783">I took over the ambulatorium from Dr. Unterman and I got all his instruments and I got medicine.</span> <span id="s784">I already knew what medicines applied to this and which medicine applied to his, and I bought in the Apotheke more medicine so I got a pass that I am in Gesundheitsdienst, which means a health service, that I could go out from the ghetto if it's needed, which was very helpful.</span> <span id="s785">And we lived again in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s786">And this was the 28th of April, the 28th of April, 1942, we were sitting home and we had dinner cause dinner was not at night, but dinner was around 12, l o'clock.</span> <span id="s787">And what the dinner was, probably a tomato soup, a potato soup, something very austere.</span> <span id="s788">So we were sitting, and then we hear somebody knocking on the door downstairs, and from the knocking we right away knew it's Germans because this was their knocking.</span> <span id="s789">Not knocking, banging.</span> <span id="s790">And somebody looked through the window.</span> <span id="s791">They saw two Gestapo men standing, because their uniforms, the Gestapo had uniforms with SS, and we knew their banging.</span> <span id="s792">So the first thing my sisters bolted the door from the inside, and the first thing was to hide the men, because in this time we thought the men are most vulnerable.</span> <span id="s793">So my brother and I we were home, so we ran out through the back door through the yard.</span> <span id="s794">We run out to a neighbor, and we run to the attic.</span> <span id="s795">We thought maybe they come to us, they will not go to them.</span> <span id="s796">My sister took my father and they put him in the outhouse in the yard and put in a padlock on the door to make believe that nobody is there because the padlock is on the outside.</span> <span id="s797">And he was there.</span> <span id="s798">They were banging and banging.</span> <span id="s799">When they saw that not nobody opens and they cannot break down the door, one of the Gestapo went around the houses to see to go from the back entrance.</span> <span id="s800">And then my sister was afraid that maybe it's not a good place for my father to be there because they keep banging.</span> <span id="s801">Maybe he should go where I am hiding, so she went and she opened the</span></p> <p><span id="s802">02:14: outhouse and let out my father.</span> <span id="s803">In this moment, the other Gestapo came from the back and he faced my father.</span> <span id="s804">He first thing, he had a list and he asked my father, "What's your name?"</span> <span id="s805">My father knew that if somebody would be on the list, he would be on the list.</span> <span id="s806">So he said, "My name is Salich.”</span> <span id="s807">Was Salsitz, but Salich.</span> <span id="s808">He looked.</span> <span id="s809">He didn't see no Salich.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Meanwhile, they dragged out the other...you know when that men from the front broke down the door, he took out the other man with him.</span> <span id="s811">His name was Hoofer.</span> <span id="s812">He was not on the list.</span> <span id="s813">And he took him to the yard, and he asked this Hoofer, "What is this man's name?"</span> <span id="s814">And he said, "Salsitz.”</span> <span id="s815">He didn't know why, what, so he said, "Salsitz.”</span> <span id="s816">Well, so they had him on the list, so they told the other man to go back and they took my father and started to push him towards a wood shed which was in the yard.</span> <span id="s817">And, naturally, we knew, they took out the revolvers, we knew what it is.</span> <span id="s818">So my two sisters, my single two sisters were with him.</span> <span id="s819">They started to scream and they runned to the Gestapo men to try to take out their revolvers.</span> <span id="s820">Why they didn't shoot them I don't understand til now.</span> <span id="s821">So one [sister], the older one, Maddle, went to one and she grabbed his hand and she tried to pull out the revolver from him so he took the revolver and hit her over the head and the head started to bleed and she fell down.</span> <span id="s822">When my second sister, the youngest sister, she was 3 years older than I, saw this.</span> <span id="s823">She run to the second one and started to twist his hand and take out the revolver.</span> <span id="s824">He did the same thing.</span> <span id="s825">He hit her til she fell down.</span> <span id="s826">And they took my father and they pushed him in this wood shed and I could hear two shots.</span> <span id="s827">Now those shots were the loudest shots I ever heard in my life.</span> <span id="s828">They were something so loud that til today, I hear them.</span> <span id="s829">Til today when I wake up at night, I could hear those two shots.</span> <span id="s830">It was something, and I saw them going in the woodshed from this attic window, but I didn't see what they're doing.</span> <span id="s831">And when they shot and my sisters were there, and they ran in and the two Gestapo men walked out from the wood shed after the two shots.</span> <span id="s832">Then you could hear the screams of my father.</span> <span id="s833">But the screams were not human screams.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">They were screams like they would come from heaven or from an unnatural animal.</span> <span id="s835">Something...not a human scream.</span> <span id="s836">He started to scream so loud I could hear it in the attic.</span> <span id="s837">The first thing he screamed, he said...he started to say Vidui.</span> <span id="s838">Vidui is a prayer when religious Jews say before death.</span> <span id="s839">And then he ended with Shema Yisrael.</span> <span id="s840">He said the Shema so loud that I could...it rings in my...in my ears.</span> <span id="s841">Then later he started to yell Nekuma, nemt Nekuma.</span> <span id="s842">It means revenge, revenge.</span> <span id="s843">Take revenge.</span> <span id="s844">And he didn't stop yelling this word revenge and when this...when he started to yell this, the two men, the two Gestapo heard it because they were in the next yard.</span> <span id="s845">They came back because they heard him still yelling.</span> <span id="s846">They came back and they shot him five times more and he became quiet.</span> <span id="s847">During all the time I was in this attic, I..</span> <span id="s848">.</span> <span id="s849">I couldn't...I said to hear my father's being shot....I see it.</span> <span id="s850">I hear it.</span> <span id="s851">I don't do anything?</span> <span id="s852">Why don't you do anying.</span> <span id="s853">Now what could I do?</span> <span id="s854">I wanted to say something.</span> <span id="s855">I couldn't.</span> <span id="s856">I wanted to move.</span> <span id="s857">I couldn't.</span> <span id="s858">I was like a piece of stone.</span> <span id="s859">After it was quiet I said to my brother, "I'm going down.”</span> <span id="s860">And when I came down, so the two Gestapo men and I remember, they were young, tall, blond, handsome, and one's name...I remember his name...because I saw him before.</span> <span id="s861">His name was Norman.</span> <span id="s862">Norman.</span> <span id="s863">I'm trying to get now his picture.</span> <span id="s864">And they were still standing with their revolvers in their hand.</span> <span id="s865">And when they saw me and they saw my head was all full of with bandages because this was from the operation, so they thought maybe I was wounded today because there was so much shooting.</span> <span id="s866">And usually somebody was wounded, they finished him off.</span> <span id="s867">So they came...one came into me, took out his revolver.</span> <span id="s868">And with him was a young Jewish policeman.</span> <span id="s869">So he asked him, "Where was he wounded?"</span> <span id="s870">He said, "No, he wasn't wounded.</span> <span id="s871">He just came back from the hospital.</span> <span id="s872">He had an operation on his head.”</span> <span id="s873">So he put back his revolver, and I went back to see where my father was shot.</span> <span id="s874">And then I saw my mother, with the sister, and those little babies, 3 years old, my nieces, beautiful babies like angels were sitting there and crying.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">They probably didn't know what the crying is for, but everybody is crying, they were crying.</span> <span id="s876">And I could see my mother, my sisters laying over my father and kissing his face and caressing him and he was dead.</span> <span id="s877">One hand was ripped, broken off because when they shot him they hit the hand and the bullets hit the bones and the hand was...you could see the hand laying in the side.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">02:20:20: And he was laying there and they were crying and kissing him.</span> <span id="s879">One thing I want to tell you before...before this day.</span> <span id="s880">About a week before, this Pasha Rappaport, the new president from the Judenrat came, to the Judenrat and he had a list of about 15 Jews who had long beards and he gave a note that the Jews should cut off their beards, that Farding, the Landkommissar told him that when he brings his friends to visit the ghetto, he's very much embarrassed to see so many Jews with beards.</span> <span id="s881">So he wants the beards should be cut off.</span> <span id="s882">And my father was on the list that they had to cut off the beard.</span> <span id="s883">For my father to cut off the beard was the worse thing because since his beard started to grow, he never touched a hair, even in the first world war in the army, he never touched the beard.</span> <span id="s884">So we called a young boy a barber to our home to cut his beard.</span> <span id="s885">So he begged him to leave him a little bit here.</span> <span id="s886">And when he cut it, my father was sitting, he was pale like it was white, and after he finished he got up and in Yiddish he said, "Jetzt hob Ich gefielt dem Ta'am miesse".</span> <span id="s887">.</span> <span id="s888">It means now I felt the taste of death when he cut this beard.</span> <span id="s889">And when we looked on my father we didn't recognize him.</span> <span id="s890">He looked like a strange person because we were always used to seeing him with a full grey beard.</span> <span id="s891">And here he's shaven.</span> <span id="s892">It looked like a different person.</span> <span id="s893">This a week before he was shot.</span> <span id="s894">After he was shot, the Gestapo came back and they told me with this young Jewish policeman and they said, "We want you should go and gather together all the dead people and bring them to the cemetery, to the Jewish cemetery to be buried.”</span> <span id="s895">So he took me and we went to somebody who had a wagon, and the men were shot, and you could hear from different houses screaming, yelling.</span> <span id="s896">This day they came and they had a list of 20 Jews.</span> <span id="s897">Because they said they're going to kill one percent of the Jews.</span> <span id="s898">There were two thousand Jews.</span> <span id="s899">So they had a list of 20 Jews, the most prominent Jews from before the war to be shot.</span> <span id="s900">But the end was they they killed 22.</span> <span id="s901">I don't know by mistake or just for good measure.</span> <span id="s902">You know, when you buy something, you add...but they killed 22.</span> <span id="s903">So we went and we started to get together those dead people on the wagons to take them to the Jewish cemetery.</span> <span id="s904">I went alone.</span> <span id="s905">I didn't feel anything in this time even my father was shot.</span> <span id="s906">But my father always had a reserved place on the cemetery near his father.</span> <span id="s907">Now we are Kohanim.</span> <span id="s908">I don't know if you know, Kohanim means from the priestly family.</span> <span id="s909">And this goes over from father to son from father to son, father son.</span> <span id="s910">Because the Kohanim cannot go on the cemetery, so usually the Kohanim, the priests were buried right by the road.</span> <span id="s911">There was a big road in the middle of the cemetery.</span> <span id="s912">On both sides the Kohanim were buried.</span> <span id="s913">Why?</span> <span id="s914">So their children could come closer to their graves.</span> <span id="s915">So my father's father which I am named after him was buried there, and my father always had a reserved place to be buried next to him.</span> <span id="s916">We knew about it.</span> <span id="s917">So we decided, my brother and I that we would bury my father next to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">Even[though] the general said to make one common grave.</span> <span id="s919">So what we did, when we came a few times to pick up the people.</span> <span id="s920">So then later we put our father so that his leg should stick out and I told my brother, my brother-in-law that when we will go through with the wagon, they should wait by my grandfather's grave and pull him out and we'll make a grave near his father, at least this to do for him that he should be buried near his father.</span> <span id="s921">We came.</span> <span id="s922">They waited.</span> <span id="s923">We pulled him out.</span> <span id="s924">We started to make the common grave for everybody, but my father was buried near my grandfather.</span> <span id="s925">The grave for all the people were made next to the common grave from the pogrom.</span> <span id="s926">As I told you, May the 6th, 1919, nine Jews were killed and all the nine were buried in a common grave.</span> <span id="s927">So we made the grave next to them for all the rest of people.</span> <span id="s928">We didn't make a deep grave because it started to be dark so we just made a shallow grave.</span> <span id="s929">We covered them, and we said we'll come back tomorrow to bury them.</span> <span id="s930">We came home.</span> <span id="s931">I came home and my home.</span> <span id="s932">And my mother started...was sitting and crying.</span> <span id="s933">She said, "They took away my crown...my crown," because he was the crown of the family.</span> <span id="s934">And we were sitting a whole night, and the next day my brother, my brother-in-law and I and other people went back to make the proper burial.</span> <span id="s935">Everybody brought in for the parents a tallit.</span> <span id="s936">It means a prayer shawl.</span> <span id="s937">We brought in like shrouds.</span> <span id="s938">Now we didn't prepare shrouds, but every Jew had a kittel, a white coat that he wore three times...twice a year.</span> <span id="s939">He wore it on Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s940">He wore it Passover to the Seder, and he was buried in it.</span> <span id="s941">So we brought it for my father to put him in in it.</span> <span id="s942">Also, we took a sack with wood because the wood where we was shot in the wood shed was sprinkled, soaked with blood and we believe in the Jewish tradition, we believe that the blood is the soul of the person and we wanted this should be buried, so we took the wood and we put it in the grave.</span> <span id="s943">We opened the grave and made it deep.</span> <span id="s944">We put in the kittel.</span> <span id="s945">We put in the prayer shawl, and we buried him next to my grandfather.</span> <span id="s946">We did the same thing with the other people.</span> <span id="s947">Also there is a tradition that if somebody is killed, when he is buried to put in a</span></p> <p><span id="s948">02:27: knife in his right hand.</span> <span id="s949">The belief is that this is for revenge.</span> <span id="s950">He should revenge his death.</span> <span id="s951">So we brought knives and we put in everybody's hand a knife.</span> <span id="s952">We also put in a knife in my father's hand.</span> <span id="s953">And we buried them, and when we came back I stopped by a tree.</span> <span id="s954">I didn't cry all the time.</span> <span id="s955">And I burst out and crying.</span> <span id="s956">I couldn't stop.</span> <span id="s957">And I with a such a loud a voice said, "Why?</span> <span id="s958">Why?</span> <span id="s959">Why?"</span> <span id="s960">And for about a half hour I was standing near a tree crying and crying.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">Well, I stopped.</span> <span id="s962">I couldn't cry anymore.</span> <span id="s963">We came home, and we sat down to Shivah, which is 7 days of mourning.</span> <span id="s964">Now when I sat down, my father he believed in Jahrzeit.</span> <span id="s965">Jahrzeit means that we on the day of the death we commemorate the dead person, and as we have this commemoration we say Kaddish and other prayers.</span> <span id="s966">Also we light a candle, a Jahrzeit lamp, a candle in a glass which lasted 24 hours.</span> <span id="s967">Now in the ghetto you couldn't buy candles for Jahrzeit.</span> <span id="s968">Here you go in a supermarket, you can buy as many candles as you want.</span> <span id="s969">In a ghetto, you cannot buy candles.</span> <span id="s970">My father had Jahrzeit after his father 13 days in the month of Ijar.</span> <span id="s971">This was in the spring.</span> <span id="s972">This was in the spring...13 days, and he prepared a whole year pieces of wax, pieces of paraffin, paraffin and he collected it and he wanted to make for his day to commemorate his death, this 24 hour glass with paraffin for his father 13 days in Ijar.</span> <span id="s973">It took him a whole year to collect this paraffin.</span> <span id="s974">He never did it because he was shot 11 days of the month of Ijar, 2 days earlier.</span> <span id="s975">So when I came back, he was shot ll days[in the month of Ijar].</span> <span id="s976">When I came back from the cemetery, it was 12 days in the month of Ijar.</span> <span id="s977">I went and I made a wick, I melted the paraffin and I made this Yahrzeit candle for 24 hours, and when I lit it, I lit it for both of them.</span> <span id="s978">For my father who prepared it for his father, which was a day later.</span> <span id="s979">And after my father was shot, the whole situation in our home changed.</span> <span id="s980">Because even he was not active during the war, he was 60 years old, and the Germans made the list, because he was 60 years old, that means that he was unproductive.</span> <span id="s981">Because til 60 you were productive.</span> <span id="s982">You could do something, where[as] by 60 you were not any more productive.</span> <span id="s983">So you had to be killed.</span> <span id="s984">He was 60 years old.</span> <span id="s985">And the life changed completely.</span> <span id="s986">Our life, we had to go every day to pray.</span> <span id="s987">Well, there was no prayers, but in somebody's basement a few people came together to have Minyan, to have 10 people, and we pray for it.</span> <span id="s988">So this was the first victim of my family that was killed.</span> <span id="s989">Now my brother, who was in the Judenrat in the first Judenrat, he was arrested also.</span> <span id="s990">And all of them were killed.</span> <span id="s991">My father was let out.</span> <span id="s992">He wasn't killed.</span> <span id="s993">Now I don't know if you want to know the reason why he wasn't killed.</span> <span id="s994">It...it's not necessary.</span> <span id="s995">Okay.</span> <span id="s996">So this he was, my father was the first victim from our family.</span> <span id="s997">After this killing when they killed the 22 Jews in the ghetto, every day, every day something new....and we felt in the air that something...the Germans are pushing too much, with too much orders...one order after the other that we couldn't finish the first one, a new order came in.</span> <span id="s998">Two weeks later, the Judenrat, the whole community...the leaders, were called to Rzeszow who was the capitol of the state seat the Germans called it the Gauleihter.</span> <span id="s999">Gau was like a state.</span> <span id="s1000">And this...we belonged to them.</span> <span id="s1001">They called all the presidents and all the members of the Judenrat to this town and there was a Dr.Ehrhaus.</span> <span id="s1002">He was the Kreishauptmann.</span> <span id="s1003">Kreishauptmann was like head of state.</span> <span id="s1004">And Dr. Ehrhaus was a major in the SS, and he got together all the Jews...their leaders from all the State and he came in.</span> <span id="s1005">He had a paper and he read, "As the Jews are filthy.</span> <span id="s1006">Full of lice.</span> <span id="s1007">And because they are so filthy, there is an epidemic of a typhus in our state.</span> <span id="s1008">I am putting in Polish .</span> <span id="s1009">Kontributsia, means they have to pay so much money.</span> <span id="s1010">And he gave out Rzeszow a million zlotys.</span> <span id="s1011">This town so many...200,000 zlotys.</span> <span id="s1012">Kolbuszowa 360,000 zlotys.</span> <span id="s1013">And each town had to pay so much money.</span> <span id="s1014">He said, "In a week, you bring the money.</span> <span id="s1015">If you will not bring the money, how much money you will be short, so much percent people who will take from your Judenrat, from your council, and we will shoot them.</span> <span id="s1016">If there is 10 percent less, we will shoot 10 percent.</span> <span id="s1017">Twenty percent, we shoot twenty percent."</span> <span id="s1018">Pashek Rappaport who was the Aelteste, who was the president with all the members of the Judenrat came back to our town and they told this, that they need 360,000 zlotys.</span> <span id="s1019">Three hundred and sixty thousand zlotys after being in the war and the ghetto, people starved because at this time people started to starve.</span> <span id="s1020">And every day we find, did you hear this man starved...this man starved...this.</span> <span id="s1021">Started to starve.</span> <span id="s1022">They didn't have what to eat.</span> <span id="s1023">So to get together 360,000 slotas is impossible.</span> <span id="s1024">We started to collect.</span> <span id="s1025">The next day they had to go back with the whole member[ship] and everybody from the Judenrat knew that there is a shortage so much, so many will be killed.</span> <span id="s1026">Again, they took them in the same room and everybody had a burlap sack with money and asked them, "How much you have?</span> <span id="s1027">How much you have?"</span> <span id="s1028">Only our town, only Kolbuszowa, had the full amount, 360,000 zlotys.</span> <span id="s1029">All the other towns were missing.</span> <span id="s1030">Like for instance, Rzeszow needed a million zlotys.</span> <span id="s1031">They only had 750,000.</span> <span id="s1032">It means 25 percent was missing.</span> <span id="s1033">Right away, he took out 25 percent from their members of the Jewish council, put them in aside.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">The other town, the same thing.</span> <span id="s1035">And I had a list, exactly Rzeszow, Barzava.</span> <span id="s1036">I remember all the names, and in the book I have every amount and they took out so many people, they took them out in the yard, and in the yard they took out the machine gun and they shot them...25 percent or how much was this.</span> <span id="s1037">After they were shot, they got together what was remaining.</span> <span id="s1038">Ehrenhaus came back again with a new list and he said, "Within a week, you go back.</span> <span id="s1039">Every community has to pay taxes from 1914 til today, if some Jew owes taxes.”</span> <span id="s1040">Now there were Jews who were killed in the first world war fighting for their fatherland.</span> <span id="s1041">There were Jews who left for America.</span> <span id="s1042">There were Jews who died, didn't leave no nobody.</span> <span id="s1043">The community was responsible.</span> <span id="s1044">Every Jew...the Jewish community</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">02:36: had to pay up the taxes from 1914.</span> <span id="s1046">Not only this, every Pole can put in a claim that a Jew owes him money without any documentation that he owes him money and the Jewish community has to pay him within a week.</span> <span id="s1047">And again what percentage will be missing, so much will be shot.</span> <span id="s1048">They come back and this was a terrible thing.</span> <span id="s1049">Here we got 360,000 zlotys.</span> <span id="s1050">We didn't know how it was collected.</span> <span id="s1051">People are starving, and here they want we should pay off taxes from 1914 til today for people who don't exist anymore.</span> <span id="s1052">Right away the Director of Internal Revenue was notified.</span> <span id="s1053">He had to dig out books who were laying, covered with dusk and he started to add and to add.</span> <span id="s1054">We figured out, I say we the Jews figured out that we will have a half a million slotas to pay for those things which was impossible to collect.</span> <span id="s1055">But this we figured.</span> <span id="s1056">And the Poles were notified that everybody can claim their debt what the Jews owed them.</span> <span id="s1057">Imagine if they had a free hand to claim money and the way they loved us, imagine how many claims came in, without documentation.</span> <span id="s1058">One episode I remember.</span> <span id="s1059">There was a man.</span> <span id="s1060">His name was Fritz.</span> <span id="s1061">Jan Fritz.</span> <span id="s1062">He had a small store in the village and he used to buy by my father.</span> <span id="s1063">He always used to owe my father money.</span> <span id="s1064">I remember when the war broke out he owed us thousand zlotys.</span> <span id="s1065">He never paid it.</span> <span id="s1066">He came in and had a claim that my father owed him 5,000 slotas.</span> <span id="s1067">As I could go out from the ghetto and I knew him, I went to him.</span> <span id="s1068">And I said, "Fritz, you owed us money.</span> <span id="s1069">How could you come in and to say that my father owes you 5,000 zlotys.</span> <span id="s1070">You know this is a lie.”</span> <span id="s1071">He said, "If you will not go out this minute, I will raise it to 10,000 slotas.”</span> <span id="s1072">And he could do it.</span> <span id="s1073">I didn't say anything.</span> <span id="s1074">I went out.</span> <span id="s1075">Well, anyway, the claims from the Poles with the taxes came out to a million zlotys.</span> <span id="s1076">Now how can you collect from the poor, wretched Jews who are in the ghetto, who are already in the war 2 years, starving, to get a million slotas.</span> <span id="s1077">Again, got together and this time they used force.</span> <span id="s1078">They beat up some people, but anyway, in a week it had to be done.</span> <span id="s1079">In a week they went back.</span> <span id="s1080">Only Kolbuszowa, only our town, had a million slotas.</span> <span id="s1081">The rest didn't have.</span> <span id="s1082">Again the same story.</span> <span id="s1083">How much it was missing, they were shot.</span> <span id="s1084">We came back.</span> <span id="s1085">After</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">02:39: they paid, and they were shot, he came out a house, again, with a new list.</span> <span id="s1087">He said, "This time, within 7 days, every Jew had to leave the ghetto to Rzeszow.</span> <span id="s1088">I'm sorry, not 7 days, 3 days.</span> <span id="s1089">"After 3 days, within 3 days, you have time 3 days, to leave Kolbuszowa to the town of Rzeszow to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1090">And then all the towns from all the sections had to be relocated to Rzeszow and to clear out of our ghettos.</span> <span id="s1091">Of course, later we find out this was their methods.</span> <span id="s1092">They wanted to have the Jews in one place.</span> <span id="s1093">So when they came back, this was the worst thing.</span> <span id="s1094">The money somehow they sold the last thing, and we sold it to the Polish people for nothing.</span> <span id="s1095">Like everything what we had, we sold it just to get money.</span> <span id="s1096">And they got everything for nothing.</span> <span id="s1097">But the last order was the worst order.</span> <span id="s1098">We will leave our town.</span> <span id="s1099">In our town somehow, everybody had somebody, acquaintances.</span> <span id="s1100">Some people who could smuggle in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">We even had peasants we knew.</span> <span id="s1102">Here we'll go to some place.</span> <span id="s1103">Nobody knows nobody.</span> <span id="s1104">How will we survive with the children?</span> <span id="s1105">And this was the worst thing that would happen til now.</span> <span id="s1106">We had to leave our home.</span> <span id="s1107">And we started to leave.</span> <span id="s1108">The peasants were notified that they should come the next day with wagons, line up outside the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1109">Eight in the morning the doors of the ghetto were opened.</span> <span id="s1110">They came in, and everybody could pick up a peasant.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">They said you can take along anything you want.</span> <span id="s1112">And they gave us wagons.</span> <span id="s1113">The reason why, they wanted we should take along anything...only not furniture, because they wanted to accumulate, to assemble all the things that Jews have in one place, to be easier for them to take it away.</span> <span id="s1114">So the peasants were lined up and we started to load the people the merchandise.</span> <span id="s1115">Now I went out and I picked out two wagons with two horses each, peasants that I knew from my family to load everything what we had.</span> <span id="s1116">Now we decided to go the first day because my brother when he was released from jail, he became friendly with one German policeman.</span> <span id="s1117">And this German policeman helped him to get out of jail.</span> <span id="s1118">So he asked him, "What should we do?</span> <span id="s1119">Should we go with the last day or the first day?"</span> <span id="s1120">He said, "Go with the first day, because it's in the hands of the Gestapo, and you never know what they will do.</span> <span id="s1121">Maybe there will be too many people in the other ghetto.</span> <span id="s1122">They will come and they will kill everybody.</span> <span id="s1123">So go the first day.”</span> <span id="s1124">So my family went the first day.</span> <span id="s1125">We loaded the sacks with everything we had.</span> <span id="s1126">And there was a line, and they moved, we went 31 kilometers to Rzeszow.</span> <span id="s1127">Now nobody could sit on their wagon.</span> <span id="s1128">Old people, children, everybody had to walk on the right side of the wagon.</span> <span id="s1129">Walk the 31 kilometers to Rzeszow.</span> <span id="s1130">You want me to stop now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">Q: No.</span> <span id="s1132">That's okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1134">So this how we were chased out from our town.</span> <span id="s1135">There was one episode that I have to tell you.</span> <span id="s1136">There was a man.</span> <span id="s1137">He actually was from Germany.</span> <span id="s1138">He was a Jew from Germany.</span> <span id="s1139">He came back to our town, and he walked with his wife, with his son, and with his mother-in- law, and father-in-law, after the wagon.</span> <span id="s1140">But in one moment he made a mistake.</span> <span id="s1141">Instead to be on the right side, he was on the left side.</span> <span id="s1142">A German policeman which was from our town.</span> <span id="s1143">I remember even his name, Barthelmus, took a rifle and shot him.</span> <span id="s1144">He fell down.</span> <span id="s1145">His wife and his child, he had a 12 year old child, couldn't even stop for a moment to go and to see what happened with him.</span> <span id="s1146">He was left laying on the street.</span> <span id="s1147">They had to go forward.</span> <span id="s1148">Now I went to the third day, not the first day.</span> <span id="s1149">The reason I went the third day because we still had things and merchandise and I wanted to be there two days to give it out during the night to friendly Poles.</span> <span id="s1150">Maybe we'll come back.</span> <span id="s1151">Maybe we'll retrieve it.</span> <span id="s1152">So after the Jews went out with their wagons, we went and we took this men on the hand wagon and we brought him to the cemetery and we buried him.</span> <span id="s1153">And I remembered he wore a grey suit, a grey suit with blue stripes, and he had yellow shoes.</span> <span id="s1154">Usually by us, Jews didn't wear this kind of clothing, but he was from Germany.</span> <span id="s1155">He had modern clothes.</span> <span id="s1156">So I remember the grey suit with blue, not stripes, blue squares.</span> <span id="s1157">And we buried him.</span> <span id="s1158">About a week later or 2 weeks later when we came back, I had to go to the cemetery because they killed somebody and I went to bury them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">You see, before my father was killed, I never saw a dead person.</span> <span id="s1160">The minute my father was killed, I don't know, every time they had to bury somebody, it pulled me.</span> <span id="s1161">I wanted to do it.</span> <span id="s1162">I wanted to do it.</span> <span id="s1163">And before I never saw it.</span> <span id="s1164">So somebody was killed, so I took him to the cemetery.</span> <span id="s1165">When I took him to the cemetery, the caretaker of the cemetery, he was an old Polish man, I saw him wearing a grey suit with blue squares with yellow shoes.</span> <span id="s1166">So we buried him.</span> <span id="s1167">I knew that he wouldn't let it go.</span> <span id="s1168">He uncovered him and he took it out and he wore it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">Now we were in Rzeszow.</span> <span id="s1170">They brought into Rzeszow Jews.</span> <span id="s1171">In Rzeszow were in this time about 30,000 Jews.</span> <span id="s1172">They brought into Rzeszow from this town maybe other 40,000 Jews from all the little towns.</span> <span id="s1173">There was not enough place...I'm not talking about apartments or to have a roof over your head.</span> <span id="s1174">There was not enough place in the alley ways, on the streets, for all the Jews to put some place.</span> <span id="s1175">And they came with those wagons.</span> <span id="s1176">They brought their things, some better, some worse.</span> <span id="s1177">Every peasant who came to do the service was told that if he brings the Jews to Rzeszow, if he has two horses the Jew must pay him 200 zlotys for transportation.</span> <span id="s1178">If he has one horse, the Jew must pay him 100 zlotys for the transportation.</span> <span id="s1179">In case the Jew doesn't have the money or doesn't give him the money, because sometimes they didn't have, he shouldn't let unload the sacks.</span> <span id="s1180">This was his pay.</span> <span id="s1181">He can go home what they put on the wagon and take it for himself because they didn't pay him.</span> <span id="s1182">So a lot of people didn't have the 200 slotas so they took away right away which didn't make a difference.</span> <span id="s1183">The Germans took it away later.</span> <span id="s1184">So I came to Rzeszow the third day, and Rzeszow was...sometimes if you talk about tower of Babel how the people couldn't understand [one another].</span> <span id="s1185">This was the tower of Babel.</span> <span id="s1186">People were running around like crazy.</span> <span id="s1187">Children lost their parents.</span> <span id="s1188">Parents lost their</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">02:47: children.</span> <span id="s1190">They tried to find themselves.</span> <span id="s1191">Imagine to bring in so many people from different places.</span> <span id="s1192">And on the way so many people were killed.</span> <span id="s1193">Like this woman lost her husband.</span> <span id="s1194">And then a woman with children, the husband was killed because he did something wrong.</span> <span id="s1195">He went on the left side instead of the right side.</span> <span id="s1196">Everybody was lost.</span> <span id="s1197">And then to feed those people.</span> <span id="s1198">It was impossible to feed so many people who came in in one day.</span> <span id="s1199">Because they all had to come in within 3 days from all the towns around.</span> <span id="s1200">To have places, I'm not talking sanitary places, but for anything, it was impossible.</span> <span id="s1201">It was the worst sight that a person can ever imagine; some horror story, some horror picture, the people were put together.</span> <span id="s1202">This was it.</span> <span id="s1203">When they were there, came out an order that the 7th of July and this was a week later, the people from this and this section have to assemble in this and this place, and they will be relocated.</span> <span id="s1204">Nobody knew that there are death camps.</span> <span id="s1205">Nobody knew in this time that there are crematoriums.</span> <span id="s1206">Would the people know that they are death camps, like my family and my sisters, we could run away.</span> <span id="s1207">We had peasants that we knew.</span> <span id="s1208">I don't know if we would succeed to survive, but at least we would try.</span> <span id="s1209">Like those Jews I later joined them in the woods, what they never went with this transport.</span> <span id="s1210">We didn't know.</span> <span id="s1211">We figured they would send us in camps to work or something.</span> <span id="s1212">The rumor was they're going to send us to the east to the Ukraine to work in camps.</span> <span id="s1213">We didn't know about it.</span> <span id="s1214">They assembled...in one day, they assembled 30,000 Jews or 25,000 Jews.</span> <span id="s1215">This was the first day on the Umschlagplatz be taken to the railroad station.</span> <span id="s1216">Jews could take only one bundle with them.</span> <span id="s1217">Now everything they told them to take along to Rzeszow they were allowed...this was a calculated thing, so if they had to leave in their house.</span> <span id="s1218">Now, what they did, there was a big ghetto.</span> <span id="s1219">In every town, there was a big ghetto, and later made it a small ghetto.</span> <span id="s1220">This was a big ghetto.</span> <span id="s1221">So they took the people from this and this streets.</span> <span id="s1222">They cleaned them out.</span> <span id="s1223">They left everything home.</span> <span id="s1224">This way they had a chance to go in and to clean out everything.</span> <span id="s1225">The people came to the Umschlagplatz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">The Umschlagplatz was a terrible, a terrible scene.</span> <span id="s1227">I wasn't there, but later I was told.</span> <span id="s1228">Before the Jews came in, they had to leave their bundle.</span> <span id="s1229">Then later they took 2 girls, 3 girls, beautiful girls and they told them to go around and collect all valuables from the people, to collect money, to collect gold, to collect watches, and they did baskets.</span> <span id="s1230">They brought them over where the Gestapo was standing, where the SS were standing.</span> <span id="s1231">They were SS men, all drunk.</span> <span id="s1232">Later, they still didn't believe that Jews gave everything.</span> <span id="s1233">So they went and they pointed out young girls.</span> <span id="s1234">It so happens that they pointed out one of my friends.</span> <span id="s1235">A beautiful girl.</span> <span id="s1236">Her name was Susza Fein, and they put her and they undressed her and they started to look in every place if she didn't conceal something.</span> <span id="s1237">She was in this time 19 years old.</span> <span id="s1238">And they did it so cruel that they used instruments that they cut open her belly.</span> <span id="s1239">And they looked that the Jews didn't hide something.</span> <span id="s1240">The Kolbuszowa Rabbi, an old man of about 75 years was standing and he was blind.</span> <span id="s1241">So they came to him and they asked him something and he couldn't understand.</span> <span id="s1242">So they took out a revolver and they went to shoot him.</span> <span id="s1243">He had two granddaughters.</span> <span id="s1244">One was 16 and one was 18.</span> <span id="s1245">Beautiful girls.</span> <span id="s1246">They started to beg this SS men.</span> <span id="s1247">He's our grandfather.</span> <span id="s1248">He was the Rabbi of the town.</span> <span id="s1249">Please don't shoot him.</span> <span id="s1250">He will go with us.</span> <span id="s1251">So they shot him, and they shot the two girls in the same time.</span> <span id="s1252">Well, anyway, they took away 6,000 Jews, elderly, crippled, children and they took them away and they had to walk to a town near ??</span> <span id="s1253">, They had prepared ditches in the woods, and those people were killed in those ditches.</span> <span id="s1254">The rest they took to the railroad and they were transported to Belzec.</span> <span id="s1255">On the way to the railroad, they were shooting in the columns that a few hundred people remained dead on the street laying where they were shooting.</span> <span id="s1256">They put in the people in the railroad trains.</span> <span id="s1257">In the trains before they put in the people, they put on the floor untreated lime.</span> <span id="s1258">I don't know...lime if it is not treated and if it's mixed with water, it starts to boil and it start to give out gas.</span> <span id="s1259">So those were untreated lime, because they knew that soon the floor will be wet and then the gases will come out and then people will choke.</span> <span id="s1260">Instead to take from Rzeszow to Belzec by train would take 3 hours, it took them 3 days.</span> <span id="s1261">When the people came to Belzec, they opened the railroad cars.</span> <span id="s1262">More than 50 percent were dead.</span> <span id="s1263">And then they had to wait.</span> <span id="s1264">We find this out later.</span> <span id="s1265">We, at this time we didn't know...we...well, I jumped a little bit.</span> <span id="s1266">I..</span> <span id="s1267">.</span> <span id="s1268">I will tell you</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">Q: I need you to stick to what you saw.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1271">Alright.</span> <span id="s1272">Okay.</span> <span id="s1273">So when we came to Rzeszow...when I came the third day, and when I saw those things what's going on there with the people.</span> <span id="s1274">So Farding gave out an order that he needs...you see, our town...there were four towns belonged to our town...our county...that he needs hundred young boys for each town to go back, and he will make a camp, a labor camp.</span> <span id="s1275">The reason...we should destroy, taking apart the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1276">To Sokolov, Glogov, ??</span> <span id="s1277">, and ??</span> <span id="s1278">.</span> <span id="s1279">I volunteered with my brother to go back.</span> <span id="s1280">The reason I volunteered because I thought I will be back.</span> <span id="s1281">I have peasants that I know.</span> <span id="s1282">I will be able to buy food somehow to send it to our family to the ghetto, Rzeszow, because in Rzeszow they would starve.</span> <span id="s1283">But without sending them somehow, we would.</span> <span id="s1284">So we went back.</span> <span id="s1285">We walked a whole night back.</span> <span id="s1286">In the morning we were taken into the Shul, to the temple, to the Houses of Study, and this became our barracks, and this became our new life to be in a labor camp in Kolbuszowa.</span> <span id="s1287">Meanwhile the people were taken to Belzec, and they were made four transports from the people.</span> <span id="s1288">In the four transports within every week two transports, and they cleared up the big ghetto, the large ghetto and everybody was left who had a card to work, they put in the small ghetto.</span> <span id="s1289">And the small ghetto, and they liquidated the big ghetto, and we were in this time in the camp.</span> <span id="s1290">And we started to work as a labor camp.</span> <span id="s1291">What we did in the beginning we started to destroy the houses, taking apart.</span> <span id="s1292">We saved everything for the Germans.</span> <span id="s1293">For the Germans was very important to have old material, scrap, because they could make new material.</span> <span id="s1294">So we picked out one house, and one room was paper, and one was brass and lead and so on and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">And we destroyed this ghetto.</span> <span id="s1296">Destroying the ghetto was a very painful thing because we knew the people.</span> <span id="s1297">And we destroyed 300 years of a continuation of people who lived in this town for 300 years, they were conceived in those houses.</span> <span id="s1298">They died in those houses.</span> <span id="s1299">They were married in those houses.</span> <span id="s1300">And now the people are gone, and the houses are being destroyed.</span> <span id="s1301">We threw down from the attics things that you would never believe that people saved those things.</span> <span id="s1302">And you could see the poverty of the people.</span> <span id="s1303">They never throw out anything.</span> <span id="s1304">Old iron beds, old iron stoves, barrels.</span> <span id="s1305">Everything we threw it out.</span> <span id="s1306">And then later the house came down.</span> <span id="s1307">We knocked it down.</span> <span id="s1308">You could see the dust, and the dust went up and then you could see 300 years of life in this little Stetl, that it was destroyed.</span> <span id="s1309">We cleared the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1310">We made a field out of it.</span> <span id="s1311">And we still didn't know what happened to our people.</span> <span id="s1312">So we sent...we took a Pole.</span> <span id="s1313">We paid him money, and we send him to go with the road where the trains went and then he came back and he told us the story.</span> <span id="s1314">That they were taken to Belzec, and then we find out that they are death camps.</span> <span id="s1315">This was the first time that they sent to death camps, which Belzec was.</span> <span id="s1316">They tried out how to do it, so Belzec...it was not a crema...it was not gas chambers like in Auschwitz, sophisticated with Zyklon.</span> <span id="s1317">In Belzec, they had old motors, and then with the gas, with the carbon monoxide and then later they buried the people.</span> <span id="s1318">They burned them.</span> <span id="s1319">This how we find out that our people are dead.</span> <span id="s1320">We worked in this camp, and we knew that the end will be soon because we almost destroyed the ghetto and there was not any more work.</span> <span id="s1321">Why would they keep us.</span> <span id="s1322">So they get us...we had a river in our town.</span> <span id="s1323">So he get us to regulate the river, to make it straight the banks.</span> <span id="s1324">So we worked there.</span> <span id="s1325">But soon we knew that we will what will they need?</span> <span id="s1326">Farding played around with us.</span> <span id="s1327">We were like his small army.</span> <span id="s1328">We had between our people a man.</span> <span id="s1329">His name was Lampel.</span> <span id="s1330">He was a sergeant in the Austrian army.</span> <span id="s1331">He was a drill sergeant.</span> <span id="s1332">So he told them to drill us, and we used to march like soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">02:58</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">Q: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s1335">This is a good place for us to stop and change tapes.</span> <span id="s1336">End of Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">A: We worked in this camp.</span> <span id="s1340">And we had [it] quite good.</span> <span id="s1341">The reason why?</span> <span id="s1342">We didn't have no German guards.</span> <span id="s1343">All the towns around us were Judenrein.</span> <span id="s1344">There were no Jews around anymore because all the Jews were taken away.</span> <span id="s1345">We had in our section, we had a few labor camps, which the German organized.</span> <span id="s1346">One was in Breshatka, and one was in Hutta Komarovska, and one was in Mielec.</span> <span id="s1347">Mielec was quite known, because this was the second place that they tattooed people.</span> <span id="s1348">They didn't give numbers, but they had on their head a KL.</span> <span id="s1349">KL it means Konzentrations Lager.</span> <span id="s1350">Now if some people had the KL, I know they were in Mielec.</span> <span id="s1351">And this was very close to us.</span> <span id="s1352">And we didn't have no guards.</span> <span id="s1353">It means that we were on our own.</span> <span id="s1354">But Farding got us together, and he said, "If one of us will escape, 10 of us...10 will be hanged.”</span> <span id="s1355">He made us responsible for everybody, to make sure nobody will escape.</span> <span id="s1356">And every day we went to work.</span> <span id="s1357">Then later, suddenly, I became friendly with Farding, and it was very...there was one town, Sokolow.</span> <span id="s1358">Sokolow belonged to us....to our county.</span> <span id="s1359">The night of the expulsion of the Jews in Sokolow, when they told them to go to Rzeszow ghetto, Farding came to Sokolow drunk.</span> <span id="s1360">And he said he wants Jews.</span> <span id="s1361">So they started to bring him old Jews, because they figured the old Jews will not survive the trips or something.</span> <span id="s1362">He wanted and so they brought them...and he started to kill them.</span> <span id="s1363">And he killed in this night...he killed 49 Jews by himself with his own hand.</span> <span id="s1364">He was drunk.</span> <span id="s1365">He had a bottle of vodka.</span> <span id="s1366">He drank Vodka, and he killed.</span> <span id="s1367">They brought him Jews and he killed.</span> <span id="s1368">There was a pile of Jews.</span> <span id="s1369">But he was such a sadist, and he knew everything about Jewish religion because they...like I told you before he spoke Polish.</span> <span id="s1370">He said, "He's going to kill the Jews to make them kosher.</span> <span id="s1371">They should go straight to heaven because they will be kosher.”</span> <span id="s1372">And he told them he's going to do with the Jews the same thing as Jews did with chickens before the war.</span> <span id="s1373">If a chicken had to be made kosher, and if it had to be soaked in water, then later put in salt on all sides, and then later this had to be done in the night with candles, two candles...had to be held near the chicken to see if everything is correct.</span> <span id="s1374">So he got the two Jews holding candles.</span> <span id="s1375">He had there a bag of salt.</span> <span id="s1376">And every time he shot a Jew, he took salt and he put it on the wound and he said, "You see, now I make it kosher, and now the Jew go straight to Heaven.”</span> <span id="s1377">Those were the things to add to all that terrible things they did.</span> <span id="s1378">They played with us, like a cat plays with a mouse before...before it [kills]... So this Farding suddenly became friendly with me.</span> <span id="s1379">Now the reason why he became friendly with me...I knew why.</span> <span id="s1380">Because he liked to have somebody who should confident...who should get confident and later to find out all kind of stories that he wants to know.</span> <span id="s1381">Like he had there a young boy and I write about him a lot...a boy from 16 years, and he promoted him in the Rzeszow ghetto to be the assistant commandant of the Police.</span> <span id="s1382">A 16 year old boy...his name was Isaac Silber.</span> <span id="s1383">He was from our town.</span> <span id="s1384">And if you speak to a Rzeszow Jew about Issac Silber, you will know a lot.</span> <span id="s1385">Issac Silber was from my town.</span> <span id="s1386">He was born by my town.</span> <span id="s1387">And before the war, his mother...he didn't have a father...his mother used to be the one...she wished to work in the public baths.</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">Very low people.</span> <span id="s1389">And this Isaac Silber was very smart, and he started to be a friend with Farding.</span> <span id="s1390">Farding kept him, and he found out from him everything he wanted, and for this reason when the Jews were sent to Belzec, he promoted him.</span> <span id="s1391">And he make him the assistant commandant in Rzeszow.</span> <span id="s1392">A young boy from 16 years old.</span> <span id="s1393">So he became the famous Isaac Silber.</span> <span id="s1394">We used to call him Itschele.</span> <span id="s1395">Itschele was his name.</span> <span id="s1396">So he became friendly ...</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">Probably he thought that becoming friendly with me, maybe he would get a second Itschele or something.</span> <span id="s1398">Now the reason how I got together with him is when we came back, he found a warehouse with hundreds of crates with all kind of merchandise.</span> <span id="s1399">And on the crates was written Isaac Salsitz.</span> <span id="s1400">I don't know if you remember, when my father...in the beginning of the war, somebody squealed, and the Germans came and took away all the merchandise.</span> <span id="s1401">It took them three days to take out everything we had.</span> <span id="s1402">This was never used.</span> <span id="s1403">They put in a warehouse, and it was laying there.</span> <span id="s1404">Now Farding finds out...they found it, so he needed somebody who knew about this merchandise.</span> <span id="s1405">So he came to our commandant of our camp, which was a Jewish man from Krakow.</span> <span id="s1406">His name was Henry Mundt, and he said, Mundt I need somebody to clear out this warehouse.</span> <span id="s1407">So he said what you need better.</span> <span id="s1408">I have here a son from Isaac Salsitz.</span> <span id="s1409">Who knows better?</span> <span id="s1410">So he went...took me.</span> <span id="s1411">He sent me home with him, and I come in and I see our merchandise was laying there.</span> <span id="s1412">And what he wanted...I should make packages...to unpack everything, and make packages from soap, from coffee, from chocolate, from tea, from cocao.</span> <span id="s1413">All those things what they don't have in Germany, I made packages and I send it away.</span> <span id="s1414">I made ready to send it to his home.</span> <span id="s1415">So I worked there.</span> <span id="s1416">And while I was working there every day in the morning they took me in this room.</span> <span id="s1417">I worked there, and then in the afternoon, they let me out for lunch.</span> <span id="s1418">They let me out.</span> <span id="s1419">They searched me if I don't steal anything.</span> <span id="s1420">Steal my own stuff.</span> <span id="s1421">And they let me back for lunch.</span> <span id="s1422">And this I went every day.</span> <span id="s1423">The other boys worked to demolishing the houses or regulating the river, and I worked there.</span> <span id="s1424">He used to come in every time, and he used to discuss with me things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">And his biggest pleasure was to speak to me about girls.</span> <span id="s1426">And somehow he told me stories that since he was a young boy he was with girls.</span> <span id="s1427">And he wanted to hear stories from me, and I had invent stories to tell him what womanizer I was.</span> <span id="s1428">I didn't know her, but I had to tell him because he loved it.</span> <span id="s1429">He even taught me all kind of expressions.</span> <span id="s1430">He said do you remember Martin Luther famous saying, not the Martin Luther King, but Martin Luther, so his famous saying was (in German) .</span> <span id="s1431">It means twice a week it wouldn't hurt him, it wouldn't her, and it makes in a year 102, what is right.</span> <span id="s1432">This was his famous saying.</span> <span id="s1433">And then every time he talked different things and he asked me... One time he came in and he said to me, "Do you know what happened to your family?"</span> <span id="s1434">We knew already in this time that our family is dead.</span> <span id="s1435">So I said, "No, I would like to know.”</span> <span id="s1436">He said, "Yes, I saw your family last week in the Ukraine.”</span> <span id="s1437">They were already dead 3, 4 months.</span> <span id="s1438">He said, "If you want, I can take you...if I have my few days off, I go to Lwow with my car.</span> <span id="s1439">I will take you along and I will take you to your family where they work in a Kolkhoz.</span> <span id="s1440">They work on a farm.”</span> <span id="s1441">So I knew the family is dead.</span> <span id="s1442">I said, "This would be nice.”</span> <span id="s1443">He said, "I will do it.”</span> <span id="s1444">This...I don't know....he played around like this.</span> <span id="s1445">One day we came out, 12 o'clock from this warehouse.</span> <span id="s1446">I had a other man working with me.</span> <span id="s1447">And we stopped in a place where they used to distribute milk for free.</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">There was a milk factory, but they got the skim milk.</span> <span id="s1449">They brought it over there, and the Poles used to stand in line and get milk for their family.</span> <span id="s1450">So we made out that they gave for our kitchen...we had a kitchen there in our camp...that they gave for our kitchen every day 50 quarts of milk.</span> <span id="s1451">We made sour milk, other things.</span> <span id="s1452">But we didn't have time to stand in line because there was always a long line.</span> <span id="s1453">So I made up with a person who was in charge.</span> <span id="s1454">So in the morning we went to work.</span> <span id="s1455">On the way I left the container.</span> <span id="s1456">And when we came, lunch time, I took the container, brought it to the kitchen and went back to work.</span> <span id="s1457">One day I come for the milk .</span> <span id="s1458">There was a big line.</span> <span id="s1459">There was one woman from our town.</span> <span id="s1460">She was pretty girl...but she was not the nicest person.</span> <span id="s1461">She was a very loose woman, and during the war she had a lot of German lovers.</span> <span id="s1462">Anyway.</span> <span id="s1463">So she said to me, "You cannot go and take the milk without standing in line.</span> <span id="s1464">You're not better than we.</span> <span id="s1465">You have to stand in line.”</span> <span id="s1466">So I explained to her...I knew her from before the war...so I explained to her I cannot stay in line because only I have is a half hour to go and eat and go back.</span> <span id="s1467">She said, "I don't care.</span> <span id="s1468">If you don't stand in line, I will take the milk and I will pour it out.”</span> <span id="s1469">I didn't think she would do it, so I took the milk without, and she run to me, took the milk, and she poured it out.</span> <span id="s1470">So we came back without milk.</span> <span id="s1471">So I told her something.</span> <span id="s1472">I said, "You shouldn't do it.</span> <span id="s1473">And don't worry the war will not last forever.</span> <span id="s1474">I will remember you this.”</span> <span id="s1475">And...and that's it.</span> <span id="s1476">And I went back to work.</span> <span id="s1477">When I came home about 6, 7 o'clock a Polish commandant from the Polish police with a mustache going up like a typical Pole, he stands there and waits for me.</span> <span id="s1478">And he says to me, "You're Naftali Salsitz?"</span> <span id="s1479">I said, "Yes.”</span> <span id="s1480">"I want to tell you something.</span> <span id="s1481">Tomorrow morning, we'll have to shoot you.</span> <span id="s1482">We got orders from Farding to shoot you.</span> <span id="s1483">So what should I do?</span> <span id="s1484">"You run away.”</span> <span id="s1485">I thought he maked a joke.</span> <span id="s1486">I said, "Why?"</span> <span id="s1487">He said, "Don't ask questions.</span> <span id="s1488">I want you should live.”</span> <span id="s1489">And he was known not to be a very tremendous Jew lover, so why does he tell it to me?</span> <span id="s1490">So he said to me and I came and I told it to my friends what he told me.</span> <span id="s1491">And everybody thought that I will escape and people were afraid because if I will escape, 10 others will be shot.</span> <span id="s1492">So I said to my brother, I told him.</span> <span id="s1493">He says, "You know what' go speak to the Mayor.”</span> <span id="s1494">The Mayor was a very good friend of my father, because my father was assistant mayor before the war.</span> <span id="s1495">So I went to him and I told him this.</span> <span id="s1496">Go to Farding and see if you can see he shouldn't.</span> <span id="s1497">He said, "I cannot go.</span> <span id="s1498">I can't intervene for a Jew.”</span> <span id="s1499">So what should I do?</span> <span id="s1500">Escape.</span> <span id="s1501">Everybody... Then he said to me, "You know what?</span> <span id="s1502">There is a man.</span> <span id="s1503">His name is Halitski.</span> <span id="s1504">He is the commandant of the Kripo, criminal policei, and he was a Ukrainian, but the Germans made his this.</span> <span id="s1505">"Are you on good terms with Hailitski?"</span> <span id="s1506">I said, "Very good terms.”</span> <span id="s1507">Now Halitski we were on good terms.</span> <span id="s1508">Why?</span> <span id="s1509">Because before the war, he was like a plain detective.</span> <span id="s1510">And every holiday, he used to come to my father and he used to give him flour and sugar.</span> <span id="s1511">You know just to be on good terms.</span> <span id="s1512">So we were good to him.</span> <span id="s1513">So I went to Hailitzski, and I said to Halitzski, if I can...you see, I could work.</span> <span id="s1514">I had a pass to work.</span> <span id="s1515">So I came to Halitzski, and he was a commandant of the Kripo, and I said to him, "Can I talk to you?"</span> <span id="s1516">He said, "Yes.”</span> <span id="s1517">"I have to tell you something.”</span> <span id="s1518">He said, "What do you want to tell me?</span> <span id="s1519">That tomorrow you will be shot?"</span> <span id="s1520">I said, "Yes.”</span> <span id="s1521">"I know about it.”</span> <span id="s1522">He already knew about it.</span> <span id="s1523">So I said, "I came to you.</span> <span id="s1524">Maybe you can help me.</span> <span id="s1525">You were a friend with my father.”</span> <span id="s1526">He said, "Look, I cannot help you.</span> <span id="s1527">You are a Jew.</span> <span id="s1528">I cannot help you.</span> <span id="s1529">But I want you should live.”</span> <span id="s1530">"So what should I do?"</span> <span id="s1531">"Run away.”</span> <span id="s1532">I said, "You're the commandant of the Kripo should tell me to run away.”</span> <span id="s1533">He said, "Yes.”</span> <span id="s1534">I said, "They will hang 10 others.”</span> <span id="s1535">He said, "What do you care.</span> <span id="s1536">You will save your life.”</span> <span id="s1537">I said, "What it is this, I have my brother here.”</span> <span id="s1538">So he said, "Take your brother and run away.</span> <span id="s1539">I don't want to know about it.</span> <span id="s1540">You run away.”</span> <span id="s1541">And he cannot help.</span> <span id="s1542">I came back.</span> <span id="s1543">Everybody was afraid that I run away and then whose turn will be to be shot.</span> <span id="s1544">Well, I didn't run away.</span> <span id="s1545">I told them I will not because I don't want they should kill 10 for l.</span> <span id="s1546">The next day they went to work.</span> <span id="s1547">I said goodbye to everybody.</span> <span id="s1548">I put on very torn clothing.</span> <span id="s1549">I took it from my friend, and I gave him my good clothing because if I be shot, let them have good shoes, good pants.</span> <span id="s1550">And I came to my work, where I work in the warehouse.</span> <span id="s1551">Like nothing happened.</span> <span id="s1552">Two policeman standing there, two Polish policeman and they said to me, "You come with me.”</span> <span id="s1553">I said, "Why?"</span> <span id="s1554">And I already knew what it is so I came to them.</span> <span id="s1555">They took me to the Polish police.</span> <span id="s1556">I come in to the Polish police.</span> <span id="s1557">By the desk is sitting Patik was his name, the commandant who told me this.</span> <span id="s1558">When he saw me, he got pale.</span> <span id="s1559">He saw me that I didn't run away.</span> <span id="s1560">And there in the corner was standing a shovel and they said, "Take the shovel.”</span> <span id="s1561">So I took the shovel and he looked at me and I walked out.</span> <span id="s1562">They took me about 200 yards away and they...one of them with the rifle, the other with a rifle.</span> <span id="s1563">They said, "Start to dig.”</span> <span id="s1564">"Dig for what?"</span> <span id="s1565">"Don't ask questions?</span> <span id="s1566">DIg.”</span> <span id="s1567">So I started to dig.</span> <span id="s1568">It was already a foot high.</span> <span id="s1569">I said, "Well, I'm digging, but tell me why am I digging?"</span> <span id="s1570">"Don't ask questions?</span> <span id="s1571">Dig.”</span> <span id="s1572">And I dug...I was already til here.</span> <span id="s1573">"What it was already quite deep, so I said, "Tell me the truth.</span> <span id="s1574">Who you going to shoot here?"</span> <span id="s1575">"Don't ask.”</span> <span id="s1576">"It's me?"</span> <span id="s1577">They said, "Yes.”</span> <span id="s1578">There were two.</span> <span id="s1579">I said, "Why?"</span> <span id="s1580">He said, "Don't ask questions.”</span> <span id="s1581">So standing there two policemen with rifles, I am digging my own grave.</span> <span id="s1582">Now what went through my mind?</span> <span id="s1583">My whole life from the first minute I remember to the family this and that went through.</span> <span id="s1584">People ask, "What is the taste of death?"</span> <span id="s1585">Does somebody know the taste of death?</span> <span id="s1586">Nobody knows the taste, because if somebody is dead he cannot tell you the story the taste of death.</span> <span id="s1587">But I know the taste of death.</span> <span id="s1588">But usually the taste of death takes a second, two seconds, and somebody's shot.</span> <span id="s1589">But me the taste of death took more than an hour because I had to stay there in the grave and I knew I will be killed.</span> <span id="s1590">This was the taste of death.</span> <span id="s1591">I can tell you how the taste of death feels.</span> <span id="s1592">Not only once, I can tell you seven times how the taste of death is from other episodes.</span> <span id="s1593">So what should I do?</span> <span id="s1594">Should I throw sand?</span> <span id="s1595">How can I throw?</span> <span id="s1596">One stands in this side, one stands in this side, with the rifles.</span> <span id="s1597">So if I throw the other one, so I told the one, one was very vicious, so I said to him, "You know I ask you one favor.</span> <span id="s1598">If you know how to shoot.</span> <span id="s1599">You're teaching me how to shoot.</span> <span id="s1600">If you will shoot me, please kill me with one bullet.</span> <span id="s1601">Shoot me through the head.</span> <span id="s1602">I don't want...because I was thinking...I was afraid I will be buried alive.</span> <span id="s1603">Until today when I have dreams, I have dreams from this day, and they shot me.</span> <span id="s1604">They didn't kill me.</span> <span id="s1605">I was buried alive.</span> <span id="s1606">And then takes a long time to suffocate.</span> <span id="s1607">What can I do?</span> <span id="s1608">And I had an idea.</span> <span id="s1609">And I said to that man, "You're going to shoot me anyway.</span> <span id="s1610">Why don't you go to bring Farding to tell Farding I want to see him.</span> <span id="s1611">Farding was very shrewd.</span> <span id="s1612">And I knew on every little thing, he wants to make out something of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">They said, "I don't want to go to Farding.</span> <span id="s1614">If I got to Farding, I don't shoot you.</span> <span id="s1615">He will kill me.</span> <span id="s1616">He's a vicious man.</span> <span id="s1617">He was very bad for the Poles too.</span> <span id="s1618">I said, "Go and tell him.</span> <span id="s1619">You have nothing to lose.”</span> <span id="s1620">"You run away.”</span> <span id="s1621">I said, "How can I run away?</span> <span id="s1622">The other man stands here?"</span> <span id="s1623">He didn't want to do it.</span> <span id="s1624">Farding had a secretary.</span> <span id="s1625">Her name was Shusa Kotaleska.</span> <span id="s1626">She was a girl from my town, and I knew her from before the war.</span> <span id="s1627">So I told him, "Go and tell Shusa Kotaleska, I want to talk to her.”</span> <span id="s1628">They didn't want and one agree.</span> <span id="s1629">He said, "I will bring Shusa Kotaleska.”</span> <span id="s1630">They brought Shusa Kotaleska.</span> <span id="s1631">She was Polish.</span> <span id="s1632">When she saw me, she started to cross herself and said, "Oh Jesus, What's going on?"</span> <span id="s1633">I said, "I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">They're going to shoot me.”</span> <span id="s1635">She says, "Why?"</span> <span id="s1636">I said, "I don't know.”</span> <span id="s1637">I said, "I need a favor.</span> <span id="s1638">Go tell Fardring,.</span> <span id="s1639">is Farding in the office?"</span> <span id="s1640">She said, "Yes.”</span> <span id="s1641">"Go tell Farding I want to see him.</span> <span id="s1642">I have very important things to tell him.”</span> <span id="s1643">And I knew this would be the very...uh...things he will...” "I cannot go to Farding.</span> <span id="s1644">You know him...” I said, "Go.”</span> <span id="s1645">She went.</span> <span id="s1646">Comes back in a few mnutes, and she told Farding...she said I want to tell him something very important.</span> <span id="s1647">So she comes back and she said he wants to see you.</span> <span id="s1648">I went back, so the policeman didn't have a choice, and they with the rifles on both side, go up to Fardring.</span> <span id="s1649">Fardring comes out of the office.</span> <span id="s1650">In the office thre were about 10 girls.</span> <span id="s1651">He said, "Hey, verfluchter Jude, you there.</span> <span id="s1652">You're crazy.</span> <span id="s1653">He wasn't my friend anymore.</span> <span id="s1654">You, what you coming to see me?</span> <span id="s1655">So I said, "I have something very important to tell you.”</span> <span id="s1656">"Alright, what is it?"</span> <span id="s1657">I said, "Well, I cannot speak to you when all the people are here.</span> <span id="s1658">I want to go in the other room.”</span> <span id="s1659">He took out his revolver and he started to curse me.</span> <span id="s1660">He said, "Jude.</span> <span id="s1661">Turn around.</span> <span id="s1662">Going to shoot you like a dog.”</span> <span id="s1663">So I started to...you see, in this time, I was very calm.</span> <span id="s1664">You see by me, if I am very scared, I will become very calm.</span> <span id="s1665">And I was...and I started to smile.</span> <span id="s1666">I said, "You threaten me to shoot in there.</span> <span id="s1667">I dug my own grave.</span> <span id="s1668">And you tell me...so here at least I'll be shot under a roof.”</span> <span id="s1669">So he .</span> <span id="s1670">Alright.</span> <span id="s1671">He took me to the other room.</span> <span id="s1672">And he said, "What do you want to tell me?</span> <span id="s1673">Want to tell me that the Jews have money?</span> <span id="s1674">What you tell me?"</span> <span id="s1675">I said, "No.”</span> <span id="s1676">Said, "What do you want to tell me?"</span> <span id="s1677">"You're going to shoot me.</span> <span id="s1678">I know you like Bohnenkaffee.</span> <span id="s1679">You like coffee beans.”</span> <span id="s1680">You see my brother who was with me...he was known.</span> <span id="s1681">He was specialist in roasting coffee beans.</span> <span id="s1682">And before the war we used to roast our own coffee beans, and it was the best coffee beans we made.</span> <span id="s1683">And he knew about it.</span> <span id="s1684">And he didn't have too much coffee beans in the warehouse, and he needed it.</span> <span id="s1685">And by Germans, coffee beans was everything.</span> <span id="s1686">I had hidden by a peasant 100 kilo coffee beans before the war.</span> <span id="s1687">Not roasted, green coffee beans.</span> <span id="s1688">And if my brother will roast it, it is fresh.</span> <span id="s1689">It's very good.</span> <span id="s1690">I had it hidden.</span> <span id="s1691">We never took it out.</span> <span id="s1692">Figured maybe someday we'll need it.</span> <span id="s1693">I said, "If you let me go, I give you coffee beans.”</span> <span id="s1694">As I told him this, he got red.</span> <span id="s1695">He started to squeak with his squeaky voice.</span> <span id="s1696">His...his shaved head started to perspire and looked at me with his eyes like a pig and he...he went to me.</span> <span id="s1697">He slapped me in the face.</span> <span id="s1698">He said, "You are bribing me?"</span> <span id="s1699">I said, "Who's bribing you?</span> <span id="s1700">I don't bribe you.</span> <span id="s1701">I will give you coffee.</span> <span id="s1702">You can shoot me later.</span> <span id="s1703">What's the difference.</span> <span id="s1704">You can always shoot me.”</span> <span id="s1705">So then later he quieted down.</span> <span id="s1706">He said, "Where will you take the coffee beans?</span> <span id="s1707">You want to say that the Jews in Rzeszow have coffee beans because there were still 2,000 Jews.</span> <span id="s1708">I said, "No, I don't even know the Jews in Rzeszow.</span> <span id="s1709">I know peasants I know storekeepers.</span> <span id="s1710">They used to buy from me before the war.</span> <span id="s1711">They're in the stores.</span> <span id="s1712">I will go and buy.”</span> <span id="s1713">"Okay.</span> <span id="s1714">How much coffee beans will you give me?"</span> <span id="s1715">I said, "How much is my life worth?"</span> <span id="s1716">So he said, "50 kilo.”</span> <span id="s1717">I said, "50 kilo.</span> <span id="s1718">In the whole general government you cannot have 50 kilo coffee beans.</span> <span id="s1719">From where?"</span> <span id="s1720">So I said, "I'll give you 5 kilo" "10 Kilo" Well, we bargained and bargained.</span> <span id="s1721">Then we agreed on 25 kilo.</span> <span id="s1722">I said, "25 kilo.”</span> <span id="s1723">"When can you bring it to me?</span> <span id="s1724">Tomorrow?"</span> <span id="s1725">"What do you mean, tomorrow?</span> <span id="s1726">Where can I buy 25 kilo?"</span> <span id="s1727">Then later I spoke to him like an equal because he already made a deal with me.</span> <span id="s1728">So I said, I have to go and buy.</span> <span id="s1729">I will buy 10 here, I will buy 10 here.</span> <span id="s1730">I will put it together.</span> <span id="s1731">I need a Passierschein signed.</span> <span id="s1732">I need a pass to go.”</span> <span id="s1733">He called in Shusha Kotaleska, "Make him out a pass.”</span> <span id="s1734">And this pass I have.</span> <span id="s1735">"How long you want the pass?</span> <span id="s1736">For a week?"</span> <span id="s1737">I said, "Oh, No.</span> <span id="s1738">I need the pass at least for 6 months.”</span> <span id="s1739">So he started to jump again.</span> <span id="s1740">Well, anyway, he gave me a pass for a month.</span> <span id="s1741">Then he said to go out from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1742">I said, "No.</span> <span id="s1743">I need a pass to Rzeszow.”</span> <span id="s1744">Because I had to go to Rzeszow to other stores.</span> <span id="s1745">And then later when he agreed to Rzeszow.</span> <span id="s1746">I said, "Rzeszow and the whole state.”</span> <span id="s1747">Because I wanted to be free.</span> <span id="s1748">So he wrote down in the whole state.</span> <span id="s1749">And this Passieschein I have.</span> <span id="s1750">He gave it to me and he wrote down in the book 25 kilo coffee beans.</span> <span id="s1751">Then I asked him...yes...sorry.....he said to me, "I hope you will not escape before you give me the coffee beans.”</span> <span id="s1752">So I told him, "I will not escape because if I would lie to escape I would have escaped yesterday.</span> <span id="s1753">I knew yesterday I'll be shot.”</span> <span id="s1754">So he said, "You knew this.</span> <span id="s1755">Who told you this?"</span> <span id="s1756">"Well, if somebody wanted to save my life, I wouldn't tell you now who told me this.”</span> <span id="s1757">"You knew yesterday and you didn't escape?</span> <span id="s1758">Why didn't you escape, he asked.</span> <span id="s1759">So I said, "How can I escape when I know that if I escape you will kill 10 others.</span> <span id="s1760">So why should you kill 10 Jews when you had only l Jew.</span> <span id="s1761">He said, "You want to say you didn't escape because you wanted to save the other nine?"</span> <span id="s1762">So I said, "Tell me, Herr Landkommissar, wouldn't you do this for your friends?"</span> <span id="s1763">I said, "You would do this for your friends too.</span> <span id="s1764">I did it for my friends.”</span> <span id="s1765">He didn't say anything.</span> <span id="s1766">So he said, "Okay, okay, okay.”</span> <span id="s1767">Then later I asked him another thing.</span> <span id="s1768">I said, "Now, if we made a deal, tell me why did you tell the police to shoot me.”</span> <span id="s1769">So he said, "Yesterday, you went for milk.”</span> <span id="s1770">I said, "Yes.”</span> <span id="s1771">"And you had an argument with this woman.”</span> <span id="s1772">I said, "Yes.”</span> <span id="s1773">"And you threatened a woman, said 'You are a communist and when the Russians will come in, you will be the first one to shoot her.</span> <span id="s1774">You told her this.'</span> <span id="s1775">Because this what she told her boyfriend, and they told him.</span> <span id="s1776">So I asked him, Herr Landkommissar, Do you think that I am so stupid that I should, in a public place, even if I would think of it, do you think I would be so stupid to tell it openly?"</span> <span id="s1777">So he said, "No, I don't think so you so stupid," and he laughed.</span> <span id="s1778">And I walked home.</span> <span id="s1779">But the main thing is after this, and I told you the story about the coffee beans.</span> <span id="s1780">The main thing when older people...yal...so...the Germans if there was a grave open, the grave could never be left open without killing somebody, so he went out to the policeman.</span> <span id="s1781">They were waiting with the secretaries.</span> <span id="s1782">He said, "You know Vinoski" There was a Pole Vinoski.</span> <span id="s1783">"You go and bring him and shoot him and bury him there.”</span> <span id="s1784">And he said to me, "You wait because you'll be the one to bury him.</span> <span id="s1785">So they went and brought Vinoski.</span> <span id="s1786">Why?</span> <span id="s1787">And they shot him, and I covered him.</span> <span id="s1788">The shots were heard.</span> <span id="s1789">Vinoski he shot because the day before Farding had a little dog.</span> <span id="s1790">And Vinoski went through and the dog bit him.</span> <span id="s1791">So Vinoski complained, said the dog bit him.</span> <span id="s1792">Because the dog bit him and he complained, he had to be killed.</span> <span id="s1793">So they brought Vinoski.</span></p> <p><span id="s1794">They killed him, and I covered him.</span> <span id="s1795">And I went back with the shovel to the office, and there was sitting this Pappek, this commander.</span> <span id="s1796">And when he saw me putting back this...uh...shovel, he looked at me.</span> <span id="s1797">He couldn't understand it.</span> <span id="s1798">Here he hears a shot.</span> <span id="s1799">I had to be killed and here I am but knew he knew I wasn't shot.</span> <span id="s1800">All the boys who worked heard the shots, so they were sure I was shot.</span> <span id="s1801">So there happened a thing that I cannot forget this thing.</span> <span id="s1802">So I was waiting til they will come back from work.</span> <span id="s1803">And when they came back from work, this drill sergeant drilled them that they walked like a army with the shovels on their back, and when I was standing there on the steps and they saw me from a distance standing, they were so thrilled, so happy that I'm alive that this Lampel gave an order to them and they say Achtung which means attention, and they told him...it's like a review, and they start...and he told them to march with their feet like the Germans, you know, like the , and they started to march through me and everybody looked at me that I'm alive.</span> <span id="s1804">And then later everybody started to hug me and they kissed me that I'm alive.</span> <span id="s1805">This moment every time I tell this story, I break down because you cannot imagine that they knew that I was shot and I'm alive.</span> <span id="s1806">So this is the story from the coffee beans.</span> <span id="s1807">We worked in the camp, and I went every day to work.</span> <span id="s1808">And there were episodes and episodes and episodes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1809">03:25:40</span></p> <p><span id="s1810">Q: Talk about how you escaped.</span></p> <p><span id="s1811">A: We don't have time.</span> <span id="s1812">Okay.</span> <span id="s1813">So.</span> <span id="s1814">Escape.</span> <span id="s1815">Okay.</span> <span id="s1816">So I will not tell you those episodes because they killed once 400 people.</span> <span id="s1817">We were there, but this is not for now.</span> <span id="s1818">We were there till the 18th of November.</span> <span id="s1819">And it started to be cold.</span> <span id="s1820">And we knew that we will be liquidated.</span> <span id="s1821">The reason why we knew that we will be liquidated when we took apart the houses, the houses were from logs...from beams.</span> <span id="s1822">So we cut the beams, and he always told us, "Well, you better put them in a safe place because for the winter you will need them for fuel.”</span> <span id="s1823">Then later one day he came and he said, "There will come Poles with papers and we should give them out the wood.”</span> <span id="s1824">And when we saw that the wood has to be given away, so we knew that we will not be there in the winter.</span> <span id="s1825">So I started to prepare the escape.</span> <span id="s1826">As I had papers to go out.</span> <span id="s1827">So I started to speak to each one to convince him to escape.</span> <span id="s1828">Some wanted, some didn't have money, some didn't have a place; some were afraid.</span> <span id="s1829">Somehow I went to their acquaintances, and I made contacts and I tried to have...and I wanted to live the day when Farding will come in and to take us away, and from the hundred, not one will be left.</span> <span id="s1830">And this what I wanted.</span></p> <p><span id="s1831">Later, we will be shot.</span> <span id="s1832">But to see him that we run away.</span> <span id="s1833">Well anyway, I tried and I went and I convinced and the commandant was very much against me...the Jewish commandant, because he couldn't escape.</span> <span id="s1834">And he didn't want to make a commotion because he knew that the rest will be killed if somebody will escape.</span> <span id="s1835">So we were there until November and I was close...I already had 55 people to escape.</span> <span id="s1836">I needed 45 more to escape.</span> <span id="s1837">This was the 18th of November.</span> <span id="s1838">It started to be cold.</span> <span id="s1839">I come home from work.</span> <span id="s1840">Who waits outside?</span> <span id="s1841">Poppek.</span> <span id="s1842">This polish commandant with the long mustache.</span> <span id="s1843">He waits outside.</span> <span id="s1844">He calls me out back, he says, "Listen, you didn't listen to me last time.</span> <span id="s1845">But you were lucky.”</span> <span id="s1846">Later, he find out how I told him how I saved myself.</span> <span id="s1847">"You were lucky.</span> <span id="s1848">This night we got orders to surround the ghetto with the German police and to take you away.”</span> <span id="s1849">And I didn't know to kill on the spot, but to take you way.</span> <span id="s1850">This was enough.</span> <span id="s1851">I said, "I hope....</span> <span id="s1852">He said, "I hope this time you will listen to me, and you will save yourself.”</span> <span id="s1853">So I said, "Yes, I believe you.”</span> <span id="s1854">I went in and I started to tell it to our people.</span> <span id="s1855">The one who wanted to escape believed me.</span> <span id="s1856">The other didn't believe me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1857">There started to be a commotion and this and that.</span> <span id="s1858">And I begged them, and you could see everybody prepared a knapsack ready to escape.</span> <span id="s1859">Meanwhile, this commandant took two policeman, put them by the doors, not to let out nobody.</span> <span id="s1860">But so happens that the two policemen were my friends who we were together and they were one of the escapees...who wanted to escape.</span> <span id="s1861">So they said to him, "Don't put us in because we gonna to escape.”</span> <span id="s1862">They went out and I went to see.</span> <span id="s1863">"Go, go, go, go," and I said, "I will be the last one.”</span> <span id="s1864">I was waiting there til about...uh...2, 3 o'clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s1865">Nothing happened.</span> <span id="s1866">And I started to think, "Maybe it's not true, and maybe they went away and the rest will be shot.”</span> <span id="s1867">But I waited.</span> <span id="s1868">And about 3 in the morning one of our boys came in and they said, "Well, it's bad.</span> <span id="s1869">We are surrounded.”</span> <span id="s1870">But I didn't escape.</span> <span id="s1871">I was there.</span> <span id="s1872">I go out.</span> <span id="s1873">Two Polish policemen were standing.</span> <span id="s1874">The German policemen were on the other side.</span> <span id="s1875">And I go into one...I go next to one and I..</span> <span id="s1876">.</span> <span id="s1877">I knew him.</span> <span id="s1878">His name was Yashemik.</span> <span id="s1879">And I go to him and I said, "What...what you doing here?"</span> <span id="s1880">He said, "Well, we surround the camp.”</span> <span id="s1881">I said, "You mean I cannot go out.”</span> <span id="s1882">He said, No.”</span> <span id="s1883">I said, "But I can go out.”</span> <span id="s1884">He said, "How?"</span> <span id="s1885">"If you turn around, I can go away.”</span> <span id="s1886">Before this there was a fence.</span> <span id="s1887">I went and I loosened a few boards from the fence because I wanted to be ready.</span> <span id="s1888">So he turns around the way I said it.</span> <span id="s1889">And I was there with my friend.</span> <span id="s1890">I pulled my friend, and we jumped through the road into the fence.</span> <span id="s1891">He didn't say anything.</span> <span id="s1892">I was there in this yard and later we had to go over the road.</span> <span id="s1893">There were German with lights.</span> <span id="s1894">But anyway, I escaped.</span> <span id="s1895">From the 100, 55 escaped.</span> <span id="s1896">From the 55, 30 were caught the next 2, 3 days by</span></p> <p><span id="s1897">03:30: Poles, and they were killed.</span> <span id="s1898">Twenty-five of us reached the woods.</span> <span id="s1899">We had two other camps in our section.</span> <span id="s1900">I told you when they made our camp, Sokolov.</span> <span id="s1901">Before I escaped I had a messenger...a Polish guy on a bicycle to go to both camps to notify them that we going to be taken away.</span> <span id="s1902">He reached one camp, that 18 escaped.</span> <span id="s1903">The other camp I don't know and I didn't find out even today, because I didn't find nobody alive from them.</span> <span id="s1904">But from this camp, they joined me in the woods.</span> <span id="s1905">One was the Charlie what I want this.....</span> <span id="s1906">So we came and we escaped.</span> <span id="s1907">When we came to the woods, I found there about 35 Jews.</span> <span id="s1908">We had there three women, and those were Jews from the villages when they had to go to the ghetto, they never came to the ghetto, and they were in the woods.</span> <span id="s1909">They had peasants, food and everything.</span> <span id="s1910">We joined them, and little by little, we got more Jews coming to us, who escaped from the camp, who escaped from hiding.</span> <span id="s1911">They find out about us.</span> <span id="s1912">In the height of our strength, we were 125 Jews.</span> <span id="s1913">And we started to buy guns.</span> <span id="s1914">We had a few revolvers.</span> <span id="s1915">We had two rifles.</span> <span id="s1916">We had hand grenades.</span> <span id="s1917">And we paid a lot of money for it.</span> <span id="s1918">Like, for instance, my gun I bought, I paid 3,000 zlotys.</span> <span id="s1919">The going rate was 300 slotas, but because I wanted it, but we were happy to get it.</span> <span id="s1920">And little by little we started to melt.</span> <span id="s1921">The Polish peasants started to kill us.</span> <span id="s1922">When we went for food, when we want...they made man hunts, and one time we lost lost 29 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1923">And there was a little boy even born in the woods.</span> <span id="s1924">And we named him Tarzan, because he never wore anything, and the father and the mother were there, and he wasn't their boy.</span> <span id="s1925">He was our boy.</span> <span id="s1926">Everybody considered this boy as his.</span> <span id="s1927">And we loved him so much because we saw a continuation through this boy.</span> <span id="s1928">And one night the peasants made a manhunt and they were in a bunker.</span> <span id="s1929">They were underground.</span> <span id="s1930">He and his mother, his father was out with me and there we had a 70 year old woman, and one night they killed all the inhabitants of the bunker.</span> <span id="s1931">They took them out and they all hacked them with axes, and they killed them all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1932">And we come, I saw the mother laying there with her...with the little baby with the split head in her arms.</span> <span id="s1933">And her father came with me.</span> <span id="s1934">So little by little, we saw that we cannot survive this way because we didn't have no connections with Russia, no connections with anybody outside, and then the AK started to become stronger and stronger and stronger because the minute Stalingrad changed, the whole fortune of war and the Germans started to lose, they became big big, they went into the woods and once they were in the woods, they started to hunt Jews.</span> <span id="s1935">If they find out that there is a Jew, Jews are hiding, them came in and they killed them.</span> <span id="s1936">No Jew could join them.</span> <span id="s1937">They didn't accept Jews.</span> <span id="s1938">And if somebody would come to them, they say, "I want to join you," they would kill them right away.</span> <span id="s1939">They were very, very anti-Jewish.</span> <span id="s1940">And even they were Polish patriots, and I can never understand.</span> <span id="s1941">We had the same enemy.</span> <span id="s1942">We fight the same enemy.</span> <span id="s1943">Instead to join,</span></p> <p><span id="s1944">03:34: instead to be together, when it came to Jews, they would kill faster than the German.</span></p> <p><span id="s1945">Q: Take it easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1946">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1947">So.</span> <span id="s1948">You know, you say slow down, it reminds me a story.</span> <span id="s1949">My mother used to knit, to make sweaters, with a needle...uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s1950">Q: Crochet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1951">A: Crochet.</span> <span id="s1952">She didn't have too much wool then.</span> <span id="s1953">So she crocheted it very fast.</span> <span id="s1954">So they asked her, "Why you rushing things.”</span> <span id="s1955">She said, "I wanted to finish before I'm out of wool.”</span> <span id="s1956">So the same thing.</span> <span id="s1957">I want to tell you the story before we're out of time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1958">Q: We have time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1959">A: Well, anyway.</span> <span id="s1960">Okay.</span> <span id="s1961">So we started to be in very bad [shape].</span> <span id="s1962">Instead of go[ing] together to do something against the Germans, to destroy something, to blow up trains, our most energy was to be on the watch for the peasants and for the AK.</span> <span id="s1963">In the book, I'm describing episodes practically from so many who were killed, but now it's no time.</span> <span id="s1964">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1965">Q: I would like to hear it.</span> <span id="s1966">No, I would like an episode.</span></p> <p><span id="s1967">A: So I will give you for instance one episode.</span> <span id="s1968">I find out that one of my friends who went with me to school for seven years.</span> <span id="s1969">His name was Fascick Augustin.</span> <span id="s1970">His father was a very good friend of my father.</span> <span id="s1971">They were very wealthy peasants.</span> <span id="s1972">They had an estate.</span> <span id="s1973">But his father was the president of all kinds of monopoly from the Polish government.</span> <span id="s1974">Like kerosene, salt, matches.</span> <span id="s1975">This was Polish monopoly, and we had to buy it through him.</span> <span id="s1976">So they became very friendly.</span> <span id="s1977">Even he was on the board of the same bank as my father was, and they became very friendly.</span> <span id="s1978">And with this boy I was friendly.</span> <span id="s1979">We went to school, was sitting next to each other.</span> <span id="s1980">I find out that this boy...this Fascick Augustin became commandant from the AK in our section.</span> <span id="s1981">Now, I don't have to explain now the AK.</span> <span id="s1982">You know it, but if there it needs some explanation, this was the underground which was directed from the London government in exile.</span> <span id="s1983">And AK means in Polish "Armia Krajowa".</span> <span id="s1984">It means the home army.</span> <span id="s1985">So when I find out, here the Ak is killing us and Fascick is my friend and he's the commandant, the best thing would be to go to him to see if he wouldn't take me in with my group.</span> <span id="s1986">This was the time when our leader was killed, and I became the commandant from our group.</span> <span id="s1987">So I said I will come to him and maybe I can convince him to take us in.</span> <span id="s1988">Not only that we will be able to fight the Germans, but we will be safe from them that they shouldn't kill us.</span> <span id="s1989">I sent over a girl who belonged to the organization.</span> <span id="s1990">This is the woman whom I brought over last year.</span></p> <p><span id="s1991">And we made an appointment, and he wanted to see me.</span> <span id="s1992">He prepared there a place, a meeting place.</span> <span id="s1993">We came to the meeting place.</span> <span id="s1994">This is complicated, how and what, when.</span> <span id="s1995">But, anyway, I came there with my brother.</span> <span id="s1996">And he was very happy to see me.</span> <span id="s1997">The meeting place was made in a stable between the section of cows and the section of horses and there where the animals ate the hay, this was removable.</span> <span id="s1998">We could go in that nobody could see.</span> <span id="s1999">They cut the locks and this was a small place about, I would say about 8 by 12.</span> <span id="s2000">And then we came in, and they were very happy to see us.</span> <span id="s2001">He grabbed me and kissed me.</span> <span id="s2002">He said we will kill Germans.</span> <span id="s2003">We'll survive the war.</span> <span id="s2004">And the next day he went to...so he said right away...we were infested with lice.</span> <span id="s2005">In the woods, we didn't have no changes.</span> <span id="s2006">So he said, "Take off those rags.”</span> <span id="s2007">And he brought me fresh underwear.</span> <span id="s2008">I put on the fresh underwear.</span> <span id="s2009">My brother put on the fresh underwear.</span> <span id="s2010">And then they brought us food.</span> <span id="s2011">Then we made plans.</span> <span id="s2012">And then his...he had an older brother.</span> <span id="s2013">The older brother was Yashik was his name.</span> <span id="s2014">It was a little complicated.</span> <span id="s2015">Stashik and Yashik.</span> <span id="s2016">There were two brothers.</span> <span id="s2017">And his brothers also was in the underground, so he came in and he said to me, "You know what?</span> <span id="s2018">There is somebody who wants to sell a revolver.</span> <span id="s2019">You want to buy it?"</span> <span id="s2020">I said, "Sure, Fred.”</span> <span id="s2021">Because I was ready to buy.</span> <span id="s2022">"Go and buy it.”</span> <span id="s2023">And he went and he came back about an hour later, and he said, "He doesn't want money.</span> <span id="s2024">He wants to have a suit or two suits.”</span> <span id="s2025">I said, "No problem.</span> <span id="s2026">I have two suits still left by somebody in town.</span> <span id="s2027">I will send for it, and I will give him.</span> <span id="s2028">Bring me the revolver.”</span> <span id="s2029">He went.</span></p> <p><span id="s2030">He came back.</span> <span id="s2031">He said, "Oh, he's not home.”</span> <span id="s2032">And when he came in, I saw him holding the hand in his right pocket.</span> <span id="s2033">And I had there a knapsack that I brought, and I had there shoes, not boots, shoes and short, half shoes.</span> <span id="s2034">And I didn't need in the woods .</span> <span id="s2035">I said to him, "You know what?</span> <span id="s2036">I have those shoes," and I dragged them, "I don't need.</span> <span id="s2037">It's the same size as you.</span> <span id="s2038">Why don't you take the shoes?"</span> <span id="s2039">So he went and he opened the knapsack with the left hand.</span> <span id="s2040">And his hand was filled in the pack...I didn't suspect him, but some intuition....I don't know.</span> <span id="s2041">Then I asked him...he used to be contributor to the Polish underground newspaper and every Tuesday the newspaper came out, and this was a Tuesday.</span> <span id="s2042">I asked him, "Tell me, Yasha, today the newspaper came out.</span> <span id="s2043">What is there news.”</span> <span id="s2044">Because from the underground newspaper, we could find out more than from the German newspaper.</span> <span id="s2045">"What is the news.”</span> <span id="s2046">He said, "I forgot.”</span> <span id="s2047">To me, it was something.</span> <span id="s2048">He is a contributor and I ask him about the news, but he says I forgot.</span> <span id="s2049">He opens the knapsack with the left hand.</span> <span id="s2050">He doesn't take...so intuition, and I was in this time already in a bundle of straw with my brother covered with a military blanket because we want to rest.</span> <span id="s2051">Something told me and I lifted up the blanket and I took out my revolver.</span> <span id="s2052">I always had my revolver with me even if I slept.</span> <span id="s2053">I had a belt, and on the belt I had a revolver, a hatchet, hand grenades, a flashlight, the whole arsenal I had around me.</span> <span id="s2054">So I took out the revolver, and I lifted the blanket and I had a long barrel revolver, and I lifted it he shouldn't see that I'm holding and I cocked the revolver.</span> <span id="s2055">I held it straight to him.</span> <span id="s2056">In this moment and he was still standing in front of me holding his hand in the package, in this moment, my brother didn't know what I'm doing.</span> <span id="s2057">He wanted to go down.</span> <span id="s2058">He opened the blanket.</span> <span id="s2059">And he saw and he left me exposed with my revolver pointed to him.</span> <span id="s2060">The minute he saw it he walked out.</span> <span id="s2061">Then I said to my brother, "What did you do?"</span> <span id="s2062">And he couldn't...he said to me, "Why didn't you trust them.</span> <span id="s2063">Those are people want to save us.”</span> <span id="s2064">"Well, it was done.</span> <span id="s2065">It's too late.”</span> <span id="s2066">About 10 minutes after he left, we heard knocks on the wall.</span> <span id="s2067">Later, we find out, those knocks were a signal for him to do something.</span> <span id="s2068">Because this was near the road, and on the road was a German patrol.</span> <span id="s2069">So they had to let them and this later we found out, to let them know that the German patrol was far away that he could start to shoot.</span> <span id="s2070">But we didn't know about it.</span> <span id="s2071">But when he saw me ready, he walked out.</span> <span id="s2072">The next day we didn't know what to do, how to face them.</span> <span id="s2073">We were embarrassed.</span> <span id="s2074">But they didn't mention anything.</span> <span id="s2075">I didn't mention anything.</span> <span id="s2076">They went to town.</span> <span id="s2077">He brought me</span></p> <p><span id="s2078">03:41:30 medicine.</span> <span id="s2079">He brought me this.</span> <span id="s2080">About 5 o'clock, they came in and he brought a German newspaper and he wanted I should translate him about the front, where the front is.</span> <span id="s2081">We looked, we had a little kerosene lamp.</span> <span id="s2082">My brother started to eat, and I looked in the paper and he said to me, "Well, I lost something.</span> <span id="s2083">Why don't you lend me your flashlight.”</span> <span id="s2084">I took off the flashlight, and I gave it to him.</span> <span id="s2085">Soon as I gave him the flashlight it became dark.</span> <span id="s2086">He turned off the kerosene lamp.</span> <span id="s2087">And as it became dark, I hear a shots.</span> <span id="s2088">One, two, three, four.</span> <span id="s2089">I didn't know what, when.</span> <span id="s2090">And I fell down.</span> <span id="s2091">I fell down.</span> <span id="s2092">I was [old you see??]</span> <span id="s2093">, and my head started to spin around.</span> <span id="s2094">In this moment...you see, I am telling you this...this takes a few seconds, a few minutes maybe.</span> <span id="s2095">But this took a split of a second and I fell.</span> <span id="s2096">And I fell down.</span> <span id="s2097">I said, "This is it.”</span> <span id="s2098">They took us in to be shot.</span> <span id="s2099">But I'm glad that somebody shot me from behind because I was always afraid to be caught by the Germans alive.</span> <span id="s2100">I didn't want they should torture me.</span> <span id="s2101">So we always had a rule in our unit that if the last bullet we cannot shoot, the last bullet we had to leave for ourself.</span> <span id="s2102">But here, I fell down.</span> <span id="s2103">I said, "Fine, this is it.</span> <span id="s2104">We went through so much.</span> <span id="s2105">The whole family doesn't live.</span> <span id="s2106">Everybody I loved doesn't live.</span> <span id="s2107">It's enough.”</span> <span id="s2108">And while I was laying there, I was thinking...but I'm still alive.</span> <span id="s2109">Why should he shoot me?</span> <span id="s2110">Why shouldn't I kill him?</span> <span id="s2111">Laying on the floor, somehow I took out my revolver, and it was dark, and I wanted to put in my index finger to pull the trigger, it was like a piece of wood.</span> <span id="s2112">I got a bullet, he shot me, I got three bullets in my neck and went through.</span> <span id="s2113">I..</span> <span id="s2114">.</span> <span id="s2115">then when I caught myself I got a bullet here, and the bullet traveled through the finger, ripped the finger apart, but didn't touch the bone.</span> <span id="s2116">So when I wanted to put in this finger, I couldn't because it didn't move.</span> <span id="s2117">Now [i.e. today] in winter, I cannot move this finger.</span> <span id="s2118">In winter, it gets stiff.</span> <span id="s2119">But during the day ??</span> <span id="s2120">.</span> <span id="s2121">Right away, I had enough.</span> <span id="s2122">I put in the other finger.</span> <span id="s2123">I put in this finger.</span> <span id="s2124">And it was dark.</span> <span id="s2125">I shot once in the air, and I had a big caliber.</span> <span id="s2126">So from the shot, I could see from the glare of it, and I could see this brother standing in the doorway because it was very small where they made the extension the door to go in.</span> <span id="s2127">So I still saw him.</span> <span id="s2128">It went so fast that I still saw him standing pointing at his revolver to me.</span> <span id="s2129">It went so fast.</span> <span id="s2130">So when I shot once, I saw him.</span> <span id="s2131">Right away, I shot him the third to him and right the third time.</span> <span id="s2132">By the third time because I didn't know that I will hit him with the first bullet.</span> <span id="s2133">When I shot him the first time I saw him already laying stretched out.</span> <span id="s2134">With my second bullet, one I shot in the air, with the second bullet, I pierced his heart and I killed him.</span> <span id="s2135">And by the third bullet, I saw him stretched out.</span> <span id="s2136">When his brother saw what happened because he saw by the glare the same thing as I and his brother start to shot to my brother.</span> <span id="s2137">When he saw what happened he ran out.</span> <span id="s2138">And this was an emergency door.</span> <span id="s2139">When he run out I shot after him, and I hit him in the spine, and he fell down.</span> <span id="s2140">Now we are naked.</span> <span id="s2141">My brother didn't know what's going on.</span> <span id="s2142">So he started to yell to them, "What you playing with firecrackers?</span> <span id="s2143">Because he couldn't understand, it went so fast.</span> <span id="s2144">So I said to him, "No.”</span> <span id="s2145">And we had our things on the attic, and there was no ladder to the attic.</span> <span id="s2146">But we had to climb through the beams.</span> <span id="s2147">Took the revolver in my teeth, I started to climb and I wanted to take boots.</span> <span id="s2148">I wanted to take the medicine, and also the most important thing I wanted to take, I had a diary what my sister started the first day of the war.</span> <span id="s2149">And every day she wrote in the diary.</span> <span id="s2150">But because we came to him, I figured I will be able to sit and I will enter for a few days.</span> <span id="s2151">So I wanted to get the diary.</span> <span id="s2152">But in the dark, scared, you [are] hit, I don't know where I'm hit.</span> <span id="s2153">So when I took one boot out of the ??</span> <span id="s2154">I took this and that.</span> <span id="s2155">I left everything.</span> <span id="s2156">I jumped out.</span> <span id="s2157">I called my brother.</span> <span id="s2158">He wasn't there anymore.</span> <span id="s2159">What happened?</span> <span id="s2160">He find a door.</span> <span id="s2161">He ran out the door.</span> <span id="s2162">And his friends, there</span></p> <p><span id="s2163">03:46: were about 6 friends waiting outside.</span> <span id="s2164">They grabbed him.</span> <span id="s2165">When I came in, I remember I stepped on this dead body.</span> <span id="s2166">It was so soft.</span> <span id="s2167">So I came in...in the openings.</span> <span id="s2168">I saw a few guys.</span> <span id="s2169">And I knew the guys.</span> <span id="s2170">They were my school friends.</span> <span id="s2171">They're holding my brother.</span> <span id="s2172">And a few, standing...laying over this other brother was wounded.</span> <span id="s2173">So I was standing in the doorway.</span> <span id="s2174">I still had three bullets in my revolver, and I said to them, "If you don't let him go this minute, three of you will be killed.”</span> <span id="s2175">I said, "I never miss.</span> <span id="s2176">I have three bullets left in the revolver.</span></p> <p><span id="s2177">Three will be killed.”</span> <span id="s2178">And the minute I said it they let him go and they run away.</span> <span id="s2179">I remember I even still had enough brain, I went back and I took out from the hand of this dead guy his revolver.</span> <span id="s2180">And I said to my brother let's run we ran, it was the 18th of January.</span> <span id="s2181">Two yards high snow.</span> <span id="s2182">All we had is our underwear.</span> <span id="s2183">No shoes.</span> <span id="s2184">Nothing!</span> <span id="s2185">And we run and we didn't know where.</span> <span id="s2186">We had to run up the hill.</span> <span id="s2187">We had to cross a river.</span> <span id="s2188">And in a village, and this was about 6 o'clock in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s2189">In the village when one dog starts to bark, all dogs bark, so you could hear not one, the whole village barking.</span> <span id="s2190">And you could [see] lights and naturally, we are running.</span> <span id="s2191">We don't know where we are.</span> <span id="s2192">We're going up the hill.</span> <span id="s2193">The snow was so frozen.</span> <span id="s2194">From the moon you could see millions of diamonds in the snow.</span> <span id="s2195">Everything was so sparkling.</span> <span id="s2196">We run.</span> <span id="s2197">We didn't stop.</span> <span id="s2198">And we run, I would say about a kilometer to the first house.</span> <span id="s2199">We stopped at a house.</span> <span id="s2200">I look at my brother.</span> <span id="s2201">My brother looks at me.</span> <span id="s2202">And here it was, blood running from my neck, and the blood was, we didn't know what happened because the blood from the cold, it got thick and it became clustered, but it still was running.</span> <span id="s2203">The hand was swollen.</span> <span id="s2204">We could see a trail in the snow from our walking from drops of bloods.</span> <span id="s2205">I said, "Well, if somebody will come, they will come and they will catch us.”</span> <span id="s2206">Well, and if it's a snowy terrain in the winter, you don't know where you are, because everything looks the same.</span> <span id="s2207">I said, "Where are we?"</span> <span id="s2208">We don't know.</span> <span id="s2209">This was 6 o'clock.</span> <span id="s2210">But one thing, I knew that every 6 o'clock a autobus a bus came from Rzeszow to Kolbuszova at 6 o'clock.</span> <span id="s2211">I said, "If we would be lucky, and if we would see the bus coming I will know the direction where to go.”</span> <span id="s2212">And as I said it, we saw from a distance two reflectors from the bus.</span> <span id="s2213">It's not like here you have thousands of cars.</span> <span id="s2214">There was only one bus that came only once a day.</span></p> <p><span id="s2215">And so, more or less I figured out that I will go this way and there was a house that I knew this house, and this peasant was friendly.</span> <span id="s2216">I said, "If we would be lucky, and if I would hit this house, we would be saved.”</span> <span id="s2217">Now imagine if peasants will see us in the middle of the winter, two people naked without shoes.</span> <span id="s2218">Well, anyway, we started to go down, so I had my two revolvers.</span> <span id="s2219">I had everything on me.</span> <span id="s2220">I said to my brother, "If something will happen, you should know I will open the hand grenade and we're killing each other.”</span> <span id="s2221">He had his revolver.</span> <span id="s2222">And we went down and it so happens that I hit the house I wanted to hit.</span> <span id="s2223">Exactly it was, this was a sure thing.</span> <span id="s2224">We run up here, and this house was here.</span> <span id="s2225">So I had to go like this.</span> <span id="s2226">I hit it exactly and I knew the house.</span> <span id="s2227">And from there I knew exactly how to go back to the woods.</span> <span id="s2228">It took me a whole night.</span> <span id="s2229">I reached our friends about 5 in the morning.</span> <span id="s2230">Now on the way, we stopped...but this is not for now...I was wounded.</span> <span id="s2231">I didn't know what.</span> <span id="s2232">I went to a doctor.</span> <span id="s2233">The doctor, you see, the doctor I went to [was from] a different section because I didn't...and I had to go right away he shouldn't find out that something happened to those two guys.</span> <span id="s2234">I went to him and he checked me.</span> <span id="s2235">He said, "Here the bullets went through.</span> <span id="s2236">It was a small caliber.</span></p> <p><span id="s2237">By here the bullets went through.</span> <span id="s2238">He gave me an injection against blood poison.</span> <span id="s2239">I came back to our group.</span> <span id="s2240">The Germans heard the shots.</span> <span id="s2241">And this was the patrol.</span> <span id="s2242">When the patrol came, they shot.</span> <span id="s2243">So they told them a story that bandits came.</span> <span id="s2244">They wanted money, and they didn't give them the money, so they shot them.</span> <span id="s2245">And they took it for an answer.</span> <span id="s2246">The next day they made a report to the police.</span> <span id="s2247">When the police came to investigate.</span> <span id="s2248">And the police didn't take this answer.</span> <span id="s2249">They started to search.</span> <span id="s2250">And they find this little room, and they find the wall covered with blood when I tried to climb.</span> <span id="s2251">And they went upstairs and they found then my boots, they find there the...the case with the medicines, with</span></p> <p><span id="s2252">03:51: the instruments.</span> <span id="s2253">And they find my sister's diary.</span> <span id="s2254">And they knew it is not bandits.</span> <span id="s2255">And they took out the second boy, and they shot him right there.</span> <span id="s2256">So the second boy was also shot.</span> <span id="s2257">The Germans finished him off.</span> <span id="s2258">This was an episode.</span> <span id="s2259">Now this happened.</span> <span id="s2260">Then later it was very well known.</span> <span id="s2261">Then later they caught me.</span> <span id="s2262">They gave me poison.</span> <span id="s2263">This is a long story.</span> <span id="s2264">But this episode, I couldn't show my face.</span> <span id="s2265">Everybody knew about it, they gave a price on my head in the underground paper.</span> <span id="s2266">So once I went to a peasant to a different village.</span> <span id="s2267">And he knew that I'm Jewish because the other Jew took me over to buy something.</span> <span id="s2268">So he said in the papers it was that they will pay 100,000 zlotys for my head.</span> <span id="s2269">So he said to me, "Listen, there is that boy here.”</span> <span id="s2270">He said the name Salsitz.</span> <span id="s2271">"I would like to help him because I knew his father.</span></p> <p><span id="s2272">Maybe you know where he is.</span> <span id="s2273">Tell him to come to me.</span> <span id="s2274">I will give him bread.</span> <span id="s2275">I will give him butter.</span> <span id="s2276">I would like to help him.</span> <span id="s2277">I want to save this boy.”</span> <span id="s2278">And I knew the reason why he tells me.</span> <span id="s2279">So I said, "Listen, if I would know where he is, I could get the 100,000 zlotys.</span> <span id="s2280">Why should I tell you?</span> <span id="s2281">I want to know myself.”</span> <span id="s2282">He asked me about me because he wanted to make and to get this money.</span> <span id="s2283">So this went on for a few weeks til I joined the Ak.</span> <span id="s2284">Well I saw I couldn't, so I joined the AK in a different section, and I had papers and they accepted me when everything was healed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2285">Q: Slow down.</span> <span id="s2286">What kind of papers?</span> <span id="s2287">How did you get papers?</span></p> <p><span id="s2288">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s2289">Alright.</span> <span id="s2290">Before I left this camp.</span> <span id="s2291">The first day of Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, no, the second day of Rosh Hashanah.</span> <span id="s2292">The Jews in 1942, they killed in our town and(?)</span> <span id="s2293">Novasans they got together people from Rzeszow who wanted to run away to Hungary.</span> <span id="s2294">There was a place,Bokhnia, that they made false papers for Jews and Poles, and they went to Hungary, and Hungary was easier to survive.</span> <span id="s2295">And they caught those people, they didn't catch those people.</span> <span id="s2296">They caught this girl who was their runner, and but once I'm telling you this, I want to tell you about this girl.</span> <span id="s2297">I think she should be remembered.</span></p> <p><span id="s2298">Q: We may not have much time, so if you can condense it a little.</span></p> <p><span id="s2299">A: See, this girl was the runner, and she was caught on the list of 45 people with false papers, that they should run away to Romania, and she was caught.</span> <span id="s2300">And she was tortured.</span> <span id="s2301">She was killed.</span> <span id="s2302">The Germans knew those people because they had the documents.</span> <span id="s2303">And they arrested those people, and they brought them to us in jail when we were in the camp.</span> <span id="s2304">During the night I find out about it, and I went to the jail, and through a window, they told me those things what happened to them, that this girl was caught.</span> <span id="s2305">But there is a other list of 200 that she had to prepare documents.</span> <span id="s2306">They didn't know if they got the list.</span> <span id="s2307">But if they got the list, they will pick up the 200 too.</span> <span id="s2308">What was necessary is to go to Rzeszow which was 31 kilometers and go to Rzeszow and to warn the people that they are arrested and they should do something and to hide.</span> <span id="s2309">So soon as they told me, I told...I took the wagon with the horse what Farding gave me to bring the old junk to Rzeszow and I always had it ready packed because I never knew when I will have to go in a hurry.</span> <span id="s2310">This was at night, and I took the horse and I went to Rzeszow, 31 kilometers, because even if the Germans would catch me, I had a pass to go and I went officially because I had to bring those things.</span> <span id="s2311">So I went to Rzeszow and I came into the ghetto with these things, and I had to notify someone I know to notify that they were arrested.</span> <span id="s2312">And they are worrying about the 200 other people.</span> <span id="s2313">And they told me who to contact.</span> <span id="s2314">I contact this person, and he notified the 200 people they should go into hiding who were on the list.</span> <span id="s2315">But what the Germans did, they came and they couldn't find nobody from the 200, so they took 200 other Jews, and they brought them to us with them and in this day, the second day of Rosh Hashanah, they killed in Novasans(??)</span> <span id="s2316">.</span> <span id="s2317">this village not far from us, they killed 400 Jews.</span> <span id="s2318">They brought Jews from Hutta Kaminski (??)</span> <span id="s2319">, from ??</span> <span id="s2320">.</span> <span id="s2321">Young girls, beautiful girls, Jews who had scabs, cuts, and they reported they cannot go to work, so they took them and they killed them.</span> <span id="s2322">Now there are so many details, but it is not for now.</span> <span id="s2323">But you ask me about the other details.</span></p> <p><span id="s2324">Q: The papers</span></p> <p><span id="s2325">A: So when they killed the 400 people, I became very hysterical and I went into a Polish woman, was very friendly with my father.</span> <span id="s2326">This was the woman I gave all the merchandise when I was left, when they took away our people to Rzeszow, so I gave her the merchandise over the fence.</span> <span id="s2327">So I went to her and started to cry very hysterical.</span> <span id="s2328">I said, "I want to live.</span> <span id="s2329">I want to live.</span> <span id="s2330">Do something.</span> <span id="s2331">Do something.”</span> <span id="s2332">She said, "What can I do.”</span> <span id="s2333">She said, "What can I do?"</span> <span id="s2334">I said, "I need papers.</span> <span id="s2335">I want to run away.”</span> <span id="s2336">She said, "I can help you out with it.</span> <span id="s2337">I am a very good friend of the Monseigneur, from the Catholic Church...in Polish Dekan (dean).</span> <span id="s2338">I will ask him if he can give you papers.”</span> <span id="s2339">So I told her, "You know, I had a friend who went with me to school.</span> <span id="s2340">His name was ?</span> <span id="s2341">.</span> <span id="s2342">He looked a little like me.</span> <span id="s2343">And he went me to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s2344">And he was killed in 1939.</span> <span id="s2345">He was in the Polish army.</span> <span id="s2346">He was killed.</span> <span id="s2347">Maybe he can give me his paper, and then if there would be a picture we look very much alike.”</span> <span id="s2348">She went to the Monseigneur, and the Monseigneur gave me a birth certificate which I have with me, which they made a copy of it.</span> <span id="s2349">And he gave me this birth certificate.</span> <span id="s2350">With this birth certificate, I could show that that I was ?</span> <span id="s2351">.</span> <span id="s2352">So through this girl, she was a runner between two groups.</span> <span id="s2353">So she went to the group which was farther away from my town and she made a contact and with her I went and I was accepted and she introduced me to their commandant, she was very friendly with and he liked me.</span> <span id="s2354">He took me in, and so then I became a member of this group.</span> <span id="s2355">And this was a very important group because this group was not like from people who belonged to the underground, and they were staying in their homes.</span> <span id="s2356">This was a group who was a combat group in the woods.</span> <span id="s2357">And I was very happy to be with them because with them, we destroyed police stations, we blew up trains.</span> <span id="s2358">We did so many things because they were a force.</span> <span id="s2359">You see when I was in the woods as a Jew, I only could go out when there was a blizzard, when there was a rain.</span> <span id="s2360">I was a fugitive.</span> <span id="s2361">Everybody would give me out.</span> <span id="s2362">I have to hide the gun.</span> <span id="s2363">But when I was with them, I was a hero.</span> <span id="s2364">I came out to the village with the rifle open.</span> <span id="s2365">I put in a beret with a Polish eagle.</span> <span id="s2366">I put on a band with a white and red as a Polish patriot.</span> <span id="s2367">The girls even waited for us, to kiss us.</span> <span id="s2368">The people used to bring us vodka and food.</span> <span id="s2369">I was the same man, fighting the same enemy.</span> <span id="s2370">But here because I was a Jew, I was fugitive.</span> <span id="s2371">And here because I was Pole, I was a hero.</span> <span id="s2372">So with them, it gave me the opportunity to take, and every night there was some action because they were so strong and they could do it.</span> <span id="s2373">And with them I had the opportunity to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2374">03:59</span></p> <p><span id="s2375">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2376">We're going to have to change tapes and make a decision.</span></p> <p><span id="s2377">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s2378">But this way if you can make a decision that is a few from the woods, I would like to tell you a few episodes how we made...uh...a</span></p> <p><span id="s2379">Q: Let me ask you a question.</span> <span id="s2380">End of Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s2381">Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s2382">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2383">The tape is started.</span> <span id="s2384">You wanted to take us back.</span></p> <p><span id="s2385">A: Right.</span> <span id="s2386">I want to go back when we were quite strong yet in the woods with our Jewish group.</span></p> <p><span id="s2387">Now, our leader was a Jew who was forester, which is very unusual for a Jew to be this profession.</span> <span id="s2388">Was a very intelligent man, but mostly he was a forester because he specialized in artificial raising [of] fish.</span> <span id="s2389">He had artificial lakes...not artificial...had man made lakes, and they raised carps, and this belonged to a very rich Jew in Rzeszow and his name was Bank, and the forester's name was Pinya.</span> <span id="s2390">Well, anyway, and Froelich, Pinya Froelich, and he was the organizer of this group who was there before I came and he still was our leader.</span> <span id="s2391">Then later he was killed, and also it was a very unfortunate thing how he was killed.</span> <span id="s2392">Uh...He could be saved, but...uh... because the men who surrounded the house were peasants from his village, and he didn't to use his gun, he didn't want to shoot, because they were his friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s2393">They were people who he knew all his life, so he didn't want to harm them.</span> <span id="s2394">But nevertheless, they took him with his wife, and they took him to a barn and they killed him.</span> <span id="s2395">After this I became, I took over his place, and I became the leader.</span> <span id="s2396">Now, we wanted to do something against the Germans.</span> <span id="s2397">It was very hard for us because our main thing was to protect ourselves from the Poles who were so hostile towards us.</span> <span id="s2398">There was, as I told you before, the Poles used to get skim milk for free, but there was a factory not far from the woods when in, a milk factory, and all the peasants used to bring their milk and there they produced cheese, butter, and this was sent to Germany.</span> <span id="s2399">And from the whole section, all the Poles used to bring their milk there.</span> <span id="s2400">So we thought that we want to disrupt these things.</span> <span id="s2401">I had there a man that I knew, and he was working there.</span> <span id="s2402">And he gave me all the information when the work starts, stops, who is the guard, and how.</span> <span id="s2403">So one dark night six of us went over there and we disarmed the guard, and we went in and we destroyed the whole place.</span> <span id="s2404">It took us about an hour.</span> <span id="s2405">We broke all the equipment, and there was special equipment brought from Germany, and all the machines where they used to produce the cheese and the butter, and everything was destroyed.</span> <span id="s2406">After everything was destroyed we packed our knapsacks full of cheese, that we had it enough for about 2, 3 months and we left.</span> <span id="s2407">The next day the Germans came and they surrounded the village, and they arrested some Poles.</span> <span id="s2408">They accused them that they did some sabotage, but then later they let them out because they had proof that some partisans, they didn't know that we did it, but some partisans came and they did the damage.</span> <span id="s2409">And it was quite a big damage.</span> <span id="s2410">It was a big help for the peasants, because for months they didn't have to give the milk.</span> <span id="s2411">They didn't know what to do with the milk because there was not a facility to manufacture the cheese and the butter.</span> <span id="s2412">But then later, they rebuilt it and it by them 3 months and they started again.</span> <span id="s2413">But this was a very big satisfaction what we did.</span> <span id="s2414">Also, once a week they collected the cows from the peasants.</span> <span id="s2415">Each calf when it was born, they put in a ear ring on the calf, and this was registered.</span> <span id="s2416">And eventually they had to give over the cow to the Germans and they also had an evidence how much milk the peasant has to bring in from the cow.</span> <span id="s2417">They delivered the cows, once a week they were driven or they were taken to the railroad station so we always waited when they were taken to the railroad station they chased...not by cars, but on foot.</span> <span id="s2418">So we waited on the edge of the forest and we lured always one or two or three cows into the woods, and we took them away.</span> <span id="s2419">So this was a very big help for us because in the winter, usually, we sold some cows and then we we killed one so we had meat enough for weeks.</span> <span id="s2420">So this was also a way of trying to do some damage.</span> <span id="s2421">And, there was an other case that we were in a place that there was a search for Poles, but not for Jews anymore, but the search for Poles for taking the Poles to Germany.</span> <span id="s2422">And we were in the attic and we were hidden in the hay, and they searched even the attic, but they didn't find us, and they left the house and they took the owner from this place that we were hiding.</span> <span id="s2423">He didn't know we were there.</span> <span id="s2424">And then he escaped, so in the evening a Polish policeman came to take him back.</span> <span id="s2425">And we saw it, so we waited for him outside, and we killed him.</span> <span id="s2426">We took away his gun, his rifle, his bicycle.</span> <span id="s2427">So those were things that we tried to do as much as possible.</span> <span id="s2428">But when I joined the AK, then it was a different story because the Ak was openly more loyal, in the village they were open and they could do a lot of things.</span> <span id="s2429">They were very strong.</span> <span id="s2430">They received drops from planes, ammunition, money, medicine, and guns, everything, from England.</span> <span id="s2431">They used to drop in special assigned places in the woods, and they had all those things.</span> <span id="s2432">So we did other things like there was a police station in Glogel for instance.</span> <span id="s2433">So we surrounded the police station one night and we disarmed the policemen.</span></p> <p><span id="s2434">They were not killed, but we took away everything they had there, rifles and guns, revolvers.</span> <span id="s2435">We took it away, and we completely demolished the police station.</span> <span id="s2436">Then there was a very important railroad line which went from Rzeszow to Senjisuv (??)</span> <span id="s2437">.</span> <span id="s2438">This was not far from the forest what I described you before.</span> <span id="s2439">So a few times those railroad tracks</span></p> <p><span id="s2440">04:07:30 were blown up, and the supplies... It was not so much the supplies, but in this time the Germans started to pull out a large quantity of soldiers in the army from the eastern part in Poland.</span> <span id="s2441">And the railroads were blown up with the soldiers, and this we did about 5, 6 times, those railroad lines, which was easy to do because the railroad lines were not actually guarded so much and we were not afraid for peasants.</span> <span id="s2442">There was once an ammunition dump and not far from Rzeszow...before Rzeszow...were big forest, dense forests.</span> <span id="s2443">So once we went over there and this was everything with the Polish AK and we blew up one ammunition depot there.</span> <span id="s2444">The Germans later retaliated, but this group we knew we did it, so the same night we disappeared in the other section and actually, they didn't catch nobody.</span> <span id="s2445">But they retaliated towards the local population.</span> <span id="s2446">They didn't know exactly who did it.</span> <span id="s2447">Now one episode I want to tell you this is what we did on our own.</span> <span id="s2448">But I have to go back to that camp where we were after the destruction, after taking away our people from our town when we were in this labor camp in Kolbuszowa when we destroyed the houses of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s2449">So we were working there, a Sharfuehrer came from the SS with a Polish boy, which he was his adjudant, his helper.</span> <span id="s2450">And this Sharfuehrer was very vicious and we knew about him that he killed and he beat and always he was always drunk.</span> <span id="s2451">He always was red in his face and nose was like...from a drunkard.</span> <span id="s2452">And he came to us while we were working, and it so happened that I loaded in this time some furniture.</span> <span id="s2453">And I had a mirror in my hand, a big large mirror.</span></p> <p><span id="s2454">He said to me, "Look in this mirror.”</span> <span id="s2455">So I looked in his mirror.</span> <span id="s2456">He said, "Look what good cannon fodder you are, because this what you will be.”</span> <span id="s2457">And I didn't answer, because you couldn't answer this man.</span> <span id="s2458">And he came to see what we are doing, and there was one of my friends.</span> <span id="s2459">His name was Motek Weiss.</span> <span id="s2460">He was from Krakow, a very nice boy, fragile boy.</span> <span id="s2461">And he said to his adjudant, his name was Volstick, a Polish boy from the neighboring village and he said to him to take a 2 by 4 and to start to beat this boy.</span> <span id="s2462">And he started to beat him.</span> <span id="s2463">He fell down.</span> <span id="s2464">We put him on his feet.</span> <span id="s2465">He beat him again.</span> <span id="s2466">And he beat him so that he just was a piece of black flesh lying on the floor.</span> <span id="s2467">And later we brought him back to our barracks, and the same day he died.</span> <span id="s2468">And just he did it for fun.</span> <span id="s2469">Uh...Later, he pointed out I should go with him.</span> <span id="s2470">So I thought he was going to give me the same treatment as with this boy, but I couldn't say anything so I went with them and he said to me that he wants to get some brass.</span> <span id="s2471">He needs brass.</span> <span id="s2472">And we had brass from the old houses, from old candlesticks, and in one room in this warehouse we kept only brass.</span> <span id="s2473">I took him to show him the brass.</span> <span id="s2474">While we went there to see the brass, we went through a room where there was paper collected.</span> <span id="s2475">Now they were mostly old books.</span> <span id="s2476">You know, by Jews, we don't throw away books.</span> <span id="s2477">Books were always saved.</span> <span id="s2478">We put them on the attic of the synagogue and if it was full, so we took the books into the cemetery and we wrapped them in prayer shawls, and they were buried like human beings.</span> <span id="s2479">So in this time when we cleaned out the attic from the synagogue, there was full of old books.</span> <span id="s2480">Books that were hundred, two hundred years old.</span> <span id="s2481">They were yelllow.</span> <span id="s2482">We piled them (up).</span> <span id="s2483">We put them in this room.</span> <span id="s2484">It was stacks till the attic.</span> <span id="s2485">And he came in and he start, he always had such a hoarse voice like a drunkard, and he asked me what's here.</span> <span id="s2486">I told him paper, books.</span> <span id="s2487">"What kind of books?"</span> <span id="s2488">I told him, "Religious books.</span> <span id="s2489">Jewish books.”</span> <span id="s2490">And the books were stacked on both sides of the room that in the middle was just a passageway.</span> <span id="s2491">And from the top there was a little window.</span> <span id="s2492">And the window, through the window, rays of the sun came in.</span> <span id="s2493">And because there were books, old books there was a lot of dust, and the rays...the ray illuminated the dust that you could see through this window came like a column of light on the one spot.</span> <span id="s2494">And in this moment, it reminded me that this column is the same column as God showed to the Israelites when they left Egypt so they should know their way in the desert.</span> <span id="s2495">So in the evening, in the night, he had a column of light; in the day a column of dust.</span> <span id="s2496">And this was to show them the way how to go.</span> <span id="s2497">So in this moment, I remembered from the Bible, and I said, "This is the same column as God had it when the Israelites left Egypt.”</span> <span id="s2498">And this Scharfuehrer s, did everything what God forbid probably the way he killed and he saw the spot from the ray on the floor, and he stood in the spot and he looked up and he started to yell with his hoarse voice.</span> <span id="s2499">And he said, "Yehovah, Yehovah.</span> <span id="s2500">Wo bist Du.”</span> <span id="s2501">Means, "Yehovah, Yehovah, Where are you?</span> <span id="s2502">Yehovah, Warum hilfst Du nicht Deine Kinder?</span> <span id="s2503">.</span> <span id="s2504">"Yehovah, why don't you help your children?"</span> <span id="s2505">And he looked at me, and he said to me, "You see, Your Yehovah is old.</span> <span id="s2506">Your Yehovah is dead.</span> <span id="s2507">He cannot even hear what I am saying.</span> <span id="s2508">Now, here you are.</span> <span id="s2509">What we are doing to the Jews, and he doesn't do anything.”</span> <span id="s2510">And he spat on the floor, and he walked out.</span> <span id="s2511">In this moment, I was sure that God would punish him.</span> <span id="s2512">That God will make him lame or something will kill him.</span> <span id="s2513">After all, he said something bad about my God.</span> <span id="s2514">Maybe I had doubts of my God in this time that he didn't help us, but I think I had a right to have doubts because I was a Jew and I believed in God.</span> <span id="s2515">But he was a stranger, and he had no right to insult my God, and I was very angry.</span> <span id="s2516">And I said to myself, "I have to survive the war.</span> <span id="s2517">Even if I have to kill this guy, because he insulted my God.”</span> <span id="s2518">This was in this time when I was in the camp.</span> <span id="s2519">Naturally, there was a thing that I knew that it could never happen.</span> <span id="s2520">How could I do it?</span> <span id="s2521">But.</span> <span id="s2522">.</span> <span id="s2523">still I had in my mind.</span> <span id="s2524">Two years later...was it two years later?</span> <span id="s2525">...almost two years later, a year and a half later I was in the woods, I found out that this man., this Sharfuehrer, is in charge of Polish farms in the section where it was Przeworsk (?)</span> <span id="s2526">.</span> <span id="s2527">Przeworsk, the section I described before, belonged to the SS and he was in charge of the farms.</span> <span id="s2528">Because they didn't want to have Poles in this section, so they chased out all the Poles because this was where they perfected the V-1, V-2 rockets.</span> <span id="s2529">But they wanted to have something from the farms, so the farmers used to go over there to work, and at night they went away.</span> <span id="s2530">And he was in charge of it.</span> <span id="s2531">And I found out about it, and I was told also that every Friday, Saturday and Sunday, they have like drinkings with girls, playing cards, dancing in the substation from this Przeworsk camp.</span> <span id="s2532">Now we had in our group two Jews who came from this vicinity.</span> <span id="s2533">One was a manager in an estate, which knew very well the village and there was another one from this vicinity.</span> <span id="s2534">And also the father of the girl who helped me join the A, her name was Stashka Hodora.</span> <span id="s2535">She married later and her married...marriage name is Bargike .</span> <span id="s2536">She lives now in Warsaw, and 2 years ago I brought her over for a visit.</span> <span id="s2537">So this Stashka's father used to go and he used to work in the house where they had those gatherings every Saturday and every Sunday.</span> <span id="s2538">And he was like a worker there.</span> <span id="s2539">He took care of the horses.</span> <span id="s2540">He took care of... So through him I find out that he takes care on all those things on this farm.</span> <span id="s2541">And he told me and I had in my mind that something has to be done.</span> <span id="s2542">And I approached our group a few times and I said, this was an obsession with me that I had to do something towards him, but always my friends told me, "We cannot do it.</span> <span id="s2543">We're not strong enough and to go and make a raid on SS group and we will be killed.”</span> <span id="s2544">And I gave up the idea.</span> <span id="s2545">When I left the AK and I came back, I still find out that through this Hodora, that he works there and this man is still there in charge.</span> <span id="s2546">Then I find out that not far from us there was a group of Russian partisans.</span> <span id="s2547">You see, the front came closer to us, so also the partisans came closer to us.</span> <span id="s2548">I find out where they are, and I went over to them, and I introduced myself that I am a leader from a partisan group.</span> <span id="s2549">I didn't tell them that we were Jews because we never knew how they will accept us, and there were a lot between the Russians...there were a lot of Ukrainians also.</span> <span id="s2550">And so I didn't say that we were Jews, but we were group and I have an idea that I want they should help us.</span> <span id="s2551">And I told them that I want to make a raid on</span></p> <p><span id="s2552">04:18: this substation, and I explained to him why and that this man is there in charge.</span> <span id="s2553">He was very bad.</span> <span id="s2554">He killed a lot of people, and we can have a good job killing SS men.</span> <span id="s2555">And the head, the commandant of this group liked the idea, and it took us about two weeks.</span> <span id="s2556">He gave me two from his group, and I went over with...with them at night to see the roads, to see the topography, and to have the preparations how to do it.</span> <span id="s2557">And when we came back, we picked out a dark night and we had all the information from this Jan Hodora.</span> <span id="s2558">Him I told what we're going to do.</span> <span id="s2559">I wasn't afraid that he would betray us because this was against the Germans, and he hated the Germans.</span> <span id="s2560">And this night, it was a Saturday night, we didn't have horses.</span></p> <p><span id="s2561">They had horses.</span> <span id="s2562">So I took from my group, I took five people.</span> <span id="s2563">And they gave us 15 people and 5 of them took us as passengers on their horses, and everything was planned and we came over.</span> <span id="s2564">Now five of us wore German uniforms.</span> <span id="s2565">I wore a German uniform, and four from the Russian partisans, and they gave me a submachine guns for us, and we came to the place.</span> <span id="s2566">And we cut the telephone wires, and we sneaked through the front, they were illuminated, the windows where they were sitting, playing, dancing.</span> <span id="s2567">They had girls.</span> <span id="s2568">And we started to throw in grenades through the front windows.</span> <span id="s2569">And meanwhile, the other people came from both sides and from the rear.</span> <span id="s2570">Now in the beginning it was a resistance.</span> <span id="s2571">They started to shoot back from revolvers because they didn't expect something like this.</span> <span id="s2572">And later their firing got less and less and after it stopped, we burned the house where they were, and then later we took away the horses.</span> <span id="s2573">They had horses.</span> <span id="s2574">There was a car in the front, and there were a few motorcycles.</span> <span id="s2575">We burned the car.</span> <span id="s2576">We burned the motorcycles.</span> <span id="s2577">We took the horses, and we left.</span> <span id="s2578">Not one of them, we estimated that were about 35 SS men in this time.</span> <span id="s2579">When we</span></p> <p><span id="s2580">04:20:30 looked in the windows, more or less we estimated so many, not one escaped.</span> <span id="s2581">Because it was such a surprise attack.</span> <span id="s2582">And from us, we came back.</span> <span id="s2583">All of us came back and nothing happened to us.</span> <span id="s2584">Now when we came back and it was a wonderful feeling when I was there, and they gave me a submachine gun and I could shoot and shoot and shoot and I didn't feel anymore in this time like a fugitive.</span> <span id="s2585">I felt very, very good about myself, but we knew that something will happen that they would be seeking reprisals.</span> <span id="s2586">Right away the Russian group left.</span> <span id="s2587">They went to an other place.</span> <span id="s2588">They went more north.</span> <span id="s2589">We disappeared.</span> <span id="s2590">We were in this time...our group...with the five...we disappeared.</span> <span id="s2591">The next day the Germans came and they knew that this Russian group, Russian partisan group did it, and they surrounded the forest, and they searched and searched, but they didn't find nobody.</span> <span id="s2592">They didn't suspect the native Poles of helping us, so this was a very good feeling to do something now in this time and when I came back, so I said to myself I didn't do it so much for myself as I did it for insulting my God and this was a very, very good feeling.</span> <span id="s2593">Then later the rumors, not the rumors, the talk between the people, they told the story that this guy was killed in this raid, which we saw him through the window anyway.</span> <span id="s2594">But he was well known also.</span> <span id="s2595">Also this Scharfuehrer, who was so vicious, he also spoke Polish.</span> <span id="s2596">For this reason, if</span></p> <p><span id="s2597">04:22:30 they were like mixtures, they were even more vicious.</span> <span id="s2598">And the reason they used him because he spoke Polish.</span> <span id="s2599">He could hire the peasants.</span> <span id="s2600">He could work with them.</span> <span id="s2601">They should work in the fields, and he was in charge of this.</span> <span id="s2602">So those were the things that we did that it was very gratifying.</span> <span id="s2603">We wanted to do more, but we were hampered by the Polish population.</span> <span id="s2604">And I have to tell you what happened the last night.</span> <span id="s2605">This was the last night before the liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s2606">Now people ask you survived; it's a miracle or you are lucky or something.</span> <span id="s2607">A thousand times you could be lucky.</span> <span id="s2608">Somehow you outwitted the Germans.</span> <span id="s2609">Sometimes you made the right decision.</span> <span id="s2610">Instead to go left, you went right.</span> <span id="s2611">You had to be quick.</span> <span id="s2612">But if one time it didn't work, you didn't have a second chance.</span> <span id="s2613">The one time didn't work and that's it.</span> <span id="s2614">Now we don't know from all the people who were hiding and hiding and how many times they did things to the Germans.</span> <span id="s2615">We don't know because they are not here to tell the story.</span> <span id="s2616">Now, if I will not be here now from the whole group that we were, hundred twenty five people, from the whole group when we were liberated, only six were alive, from the hundred twenty five.</span> <span id="s2617">And the rest were killed, very few by the Germans, mostly were killed by the Poles.</span> <span id="s2618">Because the Germans didn't venture into the woods.</span> <span id="s2619">And mostly by the end six were alive.</span> <span id="s2620">Now from the six, two from my people before the war, they were Rabbinical students and they were very nice boys and they were very capable, went back to our town, to Kolbuszowa, because they said we are now free.</span> <span id="s2621">We are liberated.</span> <span id="s2622">We'll come back.</span> <span id="s2623">We'll be considered heroes.</span> <span id="s2624">We survived the war.</span> <span id="s2625">So they went back 3 days after the liberation.</span> <span id="s2626">Two were very prominent people from my town Poles, one was a Director of Internal Revenue.</span> <span id="s2627">His name was Kissel.</span> <span id="s2628">The other one had a bus company...had buses going.</span> <span id="s2629">His name was Shilenski.</span> <span id="s2630">Took them to the cemetery and they killed them.</span> <span id="s2631">Three days after the liberation!</span> <span id="s2632">So imagine going through so much, going through camps and ghettos, losing the whole family, starvation, and torture, being 2 years in the woods, and somehow they made it.</span> <span id="s2633">They survived the war.</span> <span id="s2634">And the Germans were gone.</span> <span id="s2635">Here we are.</span> <span id="s2636">There is already liberty.</span> <span id="s2637">Now the Poles supposed to be our......we lived with them for thousand years.</span> <span id="s2638">Now they took the two boys and they killed them.</span> <span id="s2639">Why I will never know.</span> <span id="s2640">Why?</span> <span id="s2641">What did they harm somebody?</span> <span id="s2642">And they were killed.</span> <span id="s2643">So from all our group, there were four left.</span> <span id="s2644">My brother and I and two brothers who were also from the village, and they survived.</span> <span id="s2645">Six months later, one of them was poisoned so he died.</span> <span id="s2646">My brother died here about 15 years ago.</span> <span id="s2647">The second brother went to Israel and he died there.</span> <span id="s2648">So I'm the only one who survived from the whole group.</span> <span id="s2649">Now I have to speak in the name of all of them because nobody can tell any stories.</span> <span id="s2650">They are dead.</span> <span id="s2651">So my responsibility is to tell their stories.</span> <span id="s2652">Now I'm preparing episodes of everybody, the circumstances how he was killed.</span> <span id="s2653">And I remember more or less about everyone who was killed, how he was killed and when and by whom.</span> <span id="s2654">So I'm preparing stories for each one how he was killed from the hundred twenty six people.</span> <span id="s2655">Looking back on all those things, we cannot understand how a people like Polish people could do a thing like this.</span> <span id="s2656">I want to tell you then the last night and I went through so many things.</span> <span id="s2657">I didn't tell you how I was poisoned because there is not too much time about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2658">04:26:30</span></p> <p><span id="s2659">Q: No.</span> <span id="s2660">No.</span> <span id="s2661">No.</span> <span id="s2662">Let's hear how you were poisoned.</span></p> <p><span id="s2663">A: So I want to tell you...I want to tell you about this last night.</span> <span id="s2664">If we will have time, we'll come back.</span> <span id="s2665">The last night I was back with my with my group.</span> <span id="s2666">There were only six left of us.</span> <span id="s2667">So I went to the same peasant Hodora what he gave me the information, and his daughter was... So I went to see how the situation is.</span> <span id="s2668">Because the front was already by us.</span> <span id="s2669">The Germans went back and back, and we knew that we could hear the detonations and the shootings and came closer and closer.</span> <span id="s2670">When we came to Hodora that night nobody was home.</span> <span id="s2671">The house was empty.</span> <span id="s2672">It was open.</span> <span id="s2673">It was empty.</span> <span id="s2674">The cows were not there.</span> <span id="s2675">So we understood.</span> <span id="s2676">Because they are afraid, the front comes close...near, so they went into the woods because to be safer.</span> <span id="s2677">Nobody was there, so we decided to stay over the next day and the next night we'll see what to do.</span> <span id="s2678">Now there was in</span></p> <p><span id="s2679">04:27:30 the barn was full with hay because this was after the harvest, so we buried ourselves in the hay.</span> <span id="s2680">During the night we could hear that a unit of calvary is going through the road, and the road was very close to the house because you could hear horses, the chains ringing.</span> <span id="s2681">And then a few came in the yard and they came into the barn where we were hiding.</span> <span id="s2682">And they started to take out hay for the horses.</span> <span id="s2683">Now we didn't know how much hay they would take out because if there could be a lot of horses, they could empty the barn, and then later we'll be exposed, but as they took out the hay, we buried ourselves more and more and more.</span> <span id="s2684">Then later we heard them speaking that this night they will go.</span> <span id="s2685">Then later we came out and they were already gone, so I said to my friend, Leiba, I said, "We cannot stay here because this is the territory that the German front is establishing.</span> <span id="s2686">We have to go over to the east and to cross over probably the Russians</span></p> <p><span id="s2687">04:28:30 are on the side.”</span> <span id="s2688">So we went to a place where there was a clearing.</span> <span id="s2689">This side the Germans were, and the other side the Russians.</span> <span id="s2690">And we were...this was a clearing.</span> <span id="s2691">So I said, "We have to move through the clearing.”</span> <span id="s2692">So he found a little brook and with this brook we started to crawl to go over to the other side.</span> <span id="s2693">But somebody spotted us and they started to shot on us from both sides.</span> <span id="s2694">You see when one side started to shoot, so the other side started to shoot.</span> <span id="s2695">So we knew here are the Germans, and here are the Russians and we're on the middle.</span> <span id="s2696">We jumped out from this little brook and they were haystacks and we buried ourselves in the haystacks.</span> <span id="s2697">Then from a distance we saw a horse with two riders on it galloping, going about 200 yards away from us, coming from one side of the forest to the other.</span> <span id="s2698">Now this man, he was from a village, and he said to me, "I cannot go out and ask him what's going on because they know me.</span> <span id="s2699">But they don't know you.</span> <span id="s2700">Go and ask them.</span> <span id="s2701">And I know those peasants.”</span> <span id="s2702">He even told me the name.</span> <span id="s2703">His name is Poslusne.</span> <span id="s2704">He said, "I know them because they are from my village.</span> <span id="s2705">I even recognize the horse because I sold them the horse before I left the village.”</span> <span id="s2706">And he recognized.</span> <span id="s2707">Well, I thought he knows.</span> <span id="s2708">I came out from the haystack and I run after them, and I started to yell, Panie Poslusne.</span> <span id="s2709">And this was at night and they, finally, they heard me.</span> <span id="s2710">And they slowed down.</span> <span id="s2711">When they slowed I came closer to them.</span> <span id="s2712">Now I saw it wasn't Poslusne.</span> <span id="s2713">It was two SS man, on one horse.</span> <span id="s2714">And this was from this unit of the horses what they sent them over as a patrol to go to the other side to find out what's going on.</span> <span id="s2715">Here I'm standing there close to them.</span> <span id="s2716">The liberation is almost here.</span> <span id="s2717">Freedom is almost here.</span> <span id="s2718">And I am standing.</span> <span id="s2719">And they jumped out from the horse, both of them, took out their revolvers, pointing at me, and I looked like a peasant.</span> <span id="s2720">I was barefoot.</span> <span id="s2721">And I had a jacket, a long jacket covered, and underneath the jacket I had my arsenal.</span> <span id="s2722">I had two revolvers, with a bayonet, with a hatchet, with a flashlight, bullets, everything I had underneath, but it was covered.</span> <span id="s2723">And when they jumped down, I didn't know what to say...what to start.</span> <span id="s2724">I couldn't show them I speak German, because Polish people didn't speak German.</span> <span id="s2725">So I started to yell and to cry in Polish and I told them what will I do.</span> <span id="s2726">My wife and my children went to the woods with the cows.</span> <span id="s2727">Now they say the Russians are coming and there are rumors the Russians are raping the women and killing the children, taking away the cows.</span> <span id="s2728">What will I do?</span> <span id="s2729">What will I do?</span> <span id="s2730">Please help me.</span> <span id="s2731">Help me.</span> <span id="s2732">And I said to them, "We are four or five years with the Germans.</span> <span id="s2733">Nothing happened to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2734">04:31: Now the Russians are coming, and there are so many rumors.</span> <span id="s2735">And then I figured I'm yelling to them.</span> <span id="s2736">I'm crying, but they don't understand.</span> <span id="s2737">They are Germans.</span> <span id="s2738">Then one of them started to translate in German to the other one what I am saying.</span> <span id="s2739">You see, you say luck, you say miracles.</span> <span id="s2740">Everything had to be, otherwise... So he started to translate.</span> <span id="s2741">When I see that he's translating, so I started to yell a little louder and cry a little more and tell him a little story because he understood.</span> <span id="s2742">And then he stopped me and he spoke to me in a very, very broken Polish.</span> <span id="s2743">Probably he was from Silesia, from Posen, something.</span> <span id="s2744">So he in very broken Polish, he ask me if I am from this village.</span> <span id="s2745">I said, "Yes.”</span> <span id="s2746">So he said to the other one in German, which I understood, he said, "Good, we don't have to go to the other side," because they were afraid to go deeper because they will be killed because they knew the Russians are there.</span> <span id="s2747">So he said, "We will take him to our commandant, and let him question him.</span> <span id="s2748">Maybe he can give us the information we want to know.</span> <span id="s2749">So he told me in Polish not to worry.</span> <span id="s2750">They will take me for questioning and then later they will go with me to find my wife and the children.</span> <span id="s2751">Well, he said it.</span> <span id="s2752">So then they said to me to go in front of them.</span> <span id="s2753">And I went in front of them.</span> <span id="s2754">And they both put back their revolvers.</span> <span id="s2755">And they had rifles on their back and they climbed on their horse.</span> <span id="s2756">They went back on the horse and I started to walk slowly in front of them and they behind me.</span> <span id="s2757">Now I started to realize, ...here the whole war I went through.</span> <span id="s2758">Here the liberation coming.</span> <span id="s2759">Now I have to be shot, because if they will take me over there.</span> <span id="s2760">Now listen, if they will open my vest, they will see.</span> <span id="s2761">How can I survive?</span> <span id="s2762">So what...what should I do?</span> <span id="s2763">I have to do something.</span> <span id="s2764">I always</span></p> <p><span id="s2765">04:33 had a long barrel revolver in my belt.</span> <span id="s2766">I never had it in my holster.</span> <span id="s2767">I had it always ready.</span> <span id="s2768">So by going in the front so a little, I put in my hand and I cocked the revolver.</span> <span id="s2769">I pulled it out slowly, and suddenly I turned around.</span> <span id="s2770">In a split second I emptied it and I shot seven bullets in them and they fell down dead from the horse.</span> <span id="s2771">Because I knew I had to.</span> <span id="s2772">And they fell down.</span> <span id="s2773">The minute I started to shoot on them so bullets, millions of bullets from both sides came in my direction because the Germans were here.</span> <span id="s2774">The Russians were here.</span> <span id="s2775">They didn't know what's going on.</span> <span id="s2776">So they started to shoot.</span> <span id="s2777">So I took the horse as a shield and I started to walk slowly toward the Russian side, and I call...yal...I bent down, and first thing I took out the revolvers again.</span> <span id="s2778">This was very important.</span> <span id="s2779">I put them in my belt to take away, and I went to the side from the Russians.</span> <span id="s2780">I was about hundred feet away from the forest.</span> <span id="s2781">A few jumped out and they surrounded me and they said in Russian I should lift my hands.</span> <span id="s2782">So they spoke to me in Russian.</span> <span id="s2783">I was very relieved and I came in and they asked me what happened.</span> <span id="s2784">So I told them what happened, that the two Germans and I shot them and the revolvers.</span> <span id="s2785">First thing they relieved me...they took away everything I had, and they said, "Let's wait til our commandant comes.”</span> <span id="s2786">About a half a hour later, the commandant came, a young fellow on a horse and he asked me, so I told him.</span> <span id="s2787">He asked me, "Who are you.”</span> <span id="s2788">I said to him, "I have a group of partisans in the other side.</span> <span id="s2789">Again I didn't say Polish or Jewish because you never knew because even then they killed a lot of Jews.</span> <span id="s2790">And those I didn't know they're Ukrainian or Russians, so they and I spoke a little Russian because I was in Russia a few months.</span> <span id="s2791">He was very surprised that I speak Russian.</span> <span id="s2792">So when I told him the whole story except ,first they took the horses.</span> <span id="s2793">Oh, I like the horse.</span> <span id="s2794">This will be my horse.</span> <span id="s2795">They took away.</span> <span id="s2796">So I said, "I'm going back for my group.</span> <span id="s2797">I have there a group about 60 people.”</span> <span id="s2798">He said, "Don't go back to the group, because if you will come back they will probably shoot you, all of you on the way coming out from the German line.”</span> <span id="s2799">He said, "You are already here.</span> <span id="s2800">Stay with us.</span> <span id="s2801">We are...we accepting you.</span> <span id="s2802">We will take you in.</span> <span id="s2803">Come with me.”</span> <span id="s2804">So I even told them, "When I go back to show the people that that I met Russian partisans, why don't you give me your submachine guns.”</span> <span id="s2805">It's called in Russian papetsha.</span> <span id="s2806">"Why don't you give me your papetsha, and I will go up and I will show them that I have met the Russians.”</span> <span id="s2807">He said, "Oh, no.</span> <span id="s2808">When you come back to me, you get it from me.</span> <span id="s2809">But to make sure, to show them that you met the Russians, he took off his hat and he took off the star with the sickle and and hammer and said, "Show them this and this will be proof enough.”</span> <span id="s2810">And he said, "Go and bring them.</span> <span id="s2811">We will wait til morning for you.”</span> <span id="s2812">He asked me, "How long will it take to bring them over.”</span> <span id="s2813">I said, "Maybe 2 hours.”</span> <span id="s2814">He said, "That will be enough time.</span> <span id="s2815">Bring them over.”</span> <span id="s2816">Now when he told me this and when I walked away I was sure he doesn't believe me the story.</span> <span id="s2817">Because he was too lenient and he let me go.</span> <span id="s2818">Now why should I go back?</span> <span id="s2819">Why should I be so stupid go back to the German line and bring over people?</span> <span id="s2820">He probably thought that I am sent out from the German side to find out if there are people, how many, and I was sure that the minute I would turn around, when I went away, he took away my two revolvers from the two Germans but he gave me back mine.</span> <span id="s2821">And I was sure that I would turn around that in the back I will be shot.</span> <span id="s2822">So when I started I walk like I was walking like on air.</span> <span id="s2823">I couldn't move my legs, but I start and farther I went I was more sure for myself and when I was already about 200 feet so I figured well now maybe, I'm safe.</span> <span id="s2824">They will not shoot me.</span> <span id="s2825">And then I started to run.</span> <span id="s2826">I run back to the haystack where my friend was lying there.</span> <span id="s2827">Naturally, he grabbed me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2828">He kissed me.</span> <span id="s2829">He was sorry.</span> <span id="s2830">He thought that I am dead, that I'm shot.</span> <span id="s2831">He didn't know that I killed the Germans.</span> <span id="s2832">So I said, "Let's go.</span> <span id="s2833">This is not for us.”</span> <span id="s2834">So we went the same way and we went where the two Germans were laying dead.</span> <span id="s2835">So going through...so then we helped ourselves to their two rifles because...we took off the two rifles, and we went over the other side.</span> <span id="s2836">We went there to a peasant hut, and we were waiting there a whole night.</span> <span id="s2837">In the morning somebody opened the barn door and I see a Russian soldier comes in with some pot and he came in.</span> <span id="s2838">He wanted to milk a cow to get some milk.</span> <span id="s2839">I jumped down and I asked him, "What's going on?"</span> <span id="s2840">He said, "Well, we liberated this village this night.”</span> <span id="s2841">I grabbed him and I hugged him and I danced around and this was my liberation.</span> <span id="s2842">So the reason why I told you this story, this was the last night.</span> <span id="s2843">Now the last night I would if I wouldn't have the quick mind to turn around to kill them or something like this, I would be dead.</span> <span id="s2844">It so happens that every day something else happened and every day, oh, you had to outsmart somebody or you had to be quick about something.</span> <span id="s2845">And this is the way that mostly survivors survived.</span> <span id="s2846">See, if somebody survived in a camp, he couldn't do anything.</span> <span id="s2847">If he didn't die of typhus, and he didn't die of starvation, he wasn't picked out in a selection to be gassed, he survived because he didn't have to fight himself...by himself to outwit...to do something.</span> <span id="s2848">He had to be strong to wait and not to be gassed.</span> <span id="s2849">But when you were on your own in the woods or like my wife on illegal papers, every day was a challenge.</span> <span id="s2850">Every day you had to do something to live another day.</span> <span id="s2851">Now you were asking me a question.</span> <span id="s2852">I didn't tell you this before.</span> <span id="s2853">Why do I tell all those stories?</span> <span id="s2854">There are people, survivors who don't want to open their mouths, and they will shut up and they don't tell because the pains come back and they cannot sleep nights.</span> <span id="s2855">You don't sleep nights.</span> <span id="s2856">You dream about it.</span> <span id="s2857">The next day you think about it.</span> <span id="s2858">And this is a vicious circle.</span> <span id="s2859">It goes day after day after night.</span> <span id="s2860">I think every survivor survived for a reason.</span> <span id="s2861">I survived for two reasons.</span> <span id="s2862">I had two legacies why I survived.</span> <span id="s2863">And this gave me strength.</span> <span id="s2864">One legacy was when my father was shot (I told you this before) the last words was, "Revenge, revenge, revenge.</span> <span id="s2865">Take revenge.”</span> <span id="s2866">And I wanted to survive.</span> <span id="s2867">I wanted to join a special unit.</span></p> <p><span id="s2868">For this reason, I joined right away the army, and I wanted to join a unit that could give me the possibility of revenge.</span> <span id="s2869">I took revenge as much as I could.</span> <span id="s2870">Looking back, some people say well revenge is not sweet because it doesn't bring anybody to life.</span> <span id="s2871">But if you will ask a person who went through so much and you will say if you have a chance to take revenge maybe not so much for me because I'm alive and this what I went through doesn't mean anything, but for the people who are not alive, the people who are killed.</span> <span id="s2872">And if I took revenge for my father, I did it gladly.</span> <span id="s2873">Now after so many years, we live in America.</span> <span id="s2874">It's a normal life.</span> <span id="s2875">We have to live like human beings, not to be like animals.</span> <span id="s2876">Like in this time everybody was an animal.</span> <span id="s2877">This gave me strength.</span> <span id="s2878">The second strength gave me when my mother was</span></p> <p><span id="s2879">04:40:30 taken to Belzec.</span> <span id="s2880">She somehow sent to somebody a letter to me when I was in the Kolbuszowa camp.</span> <span id="s2881">And she wrote me in the letter and she said, "You are the youngest.</span> <span id="s2882">You are young.</span> <span id="s2883">You are my youngest.</span> <span id="s2884">You are young.</span> <span id="s2885">You are healthy, and you are a witness.”</span> <span id="s2886">"So go on," and she said, "Let the thing that you are an orphan and let it not break you.</span> <span id="s2887">You go on and live.</span> <span id="s2888">Live.</span> <span id="s2889">Go to Palestine and tell it to David.”</span> <span id="s2890">David was my brother.</span> <span id="s2891">"Go to America and tell it to Albert.”</span> <span id="s2892">Albert was my brother.</span> <span id="s2893">"Go in the world and tell it to the world what the Germans did to us.</span> <span id="s2894">How they murdered us.</span> <span id="s2895">What they did to us.”</span> <span id="s2896">And this is a legacy that my mother gave me.</span> <span id="s2897">Not to be quiet.</span> <span id="s2898">To go out and tell and retell everybody the story, and not to let it die.</span> <span id="s2899">Because this what the Germans did, we can talk as much as want.</span> <span id="s2900">We will not even scratch the surface</span></p> <p><span id="s2901">04:41:30 because the cruelty, the barbarism (of) what they did.</span> <span id="s2902">Not only the killing.</span> <span id="s2903">To kill a Jew was a salvation for the Jew.</span> <span id="s2904">This was the best thing they did, because they relieved him from the misery.</span> <span id="s2905">But if you take a town like Warsaw, like other big towns, starvation day after day, the children who are left without their parents, and they had to go out and beg for a crumb of bread and they couldn't get and they died from hunger.</span> <span id="s2906">The cruelties.</span> <span id="s2907">Take a tree.</span> <span id="s2908">You start to cut branches.</span> <span id="s2909">The tree will die.</span> <span id="s2910">Here you took a family.</span> <span id="s2911">You killed a daughter.</span> <span id="s2912">You killed a son.</span> <span id="s2913">You killed a son-in-law.</span> <span id="s2914">You killed a grandchild.</span> <span id="s2915">Now the parent, even if he was alive, he was dead because everything was chopped up.</span> <span id="s2916">So the people have to know about the cruelties, and for this reason the Museum, the books, the telling, the testimonies, everything is important because everybody has to tell a different story.</span> <span id="s2917">And a different story about the cruelties what a human being can do, what a German can do.</span> <span id="s2918">I will never call them Nazi because I don't know who was Nazi.</span> <span id="s2919">A Nazi belonged to the party.</span> <span id="s2920">There were only, not even 2 million, but the whole nation, 99 and a half percent did it.</span> <span id="s2921">And they with their helpers, with their collaborators.</span> <span id="s2922">So for this reason, I will never say the Nazis did it.</span> <span id="s2923">I say the Germans did it.</span> <span id="s2924">With their helpers.</span> <span id="s2925">Helpers, the Poles, the Ukrainians, the Latvians, the Lithuanians.</span> <span id="s2926">They were helping.</span> <span id="s2927">The Hungarians.</span> <span id="s2928">Some countries more, some countries less.</span> <span id="s2929">But the worse thing was in Poland.</span> <span id="s2930">I can never understand how people who lived with us for so many years and were an underdog by the Germans could be so helpful even the Jew who somehow sneaked through the Germans' finger, run away from a transport.</span> <span id="s2931">Run away to a sewer in Warsaw by the opening, a Pole was waiting.</span> <span id="s2932">This I could never understand and I will not understand.</span> <span id="s2933">Sure, there were people who helped.</span> <span id="s2934">But a very small percentage.</span> <span id="s2935">If in Poland there was l percent in Poland who helped Jews, it was a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s2936">04:44</span></p> <p><span id="s2937">Q: Alright.</span> <span id="s2938">Thank you.</span> <span id="s2939">A: Well, I don't know... Q: Let's go back a little.</span> <span id="s2940">A: I beg your pardon.</span></p> <p><span id="s2941">Q: I want to go back.</span> <span id="s2942">Just for a moment.</span> <span id="s2943">I need to ask a couple of questions.</span> <span id="s2944">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2945">Q: Because I'm not always clear on the groups you were with.</span> <span id="s2946">You were with the Jewish group first?</span></p> <p><span id="s2947">A: First, we had the Jewish group.</span> <span id="s2948">Right?</span> <span id="s2949">Q: Then the second group was AK?</span></p> <p><span id="s2950">A: The AK.</span> <span id="s2951">Yes.</span> <span id="s2952">With the AK, I was quite long.</span> <span id="s2953">I was a few months with AK.</span> <span id="s2954">Q: And the third group?</span></p> <p><span id="s2955">A: Was the Russian.</span> <span id="s2956">But you see, with the Russians I didn't stay.</span> <span id="s2957">The Russians I only came to them and I asked them for help.</span> <span id="s2958">I asked them for help to do this thing with this Scharfuehrer, which they agreed.</span> <span id="s2959">So I was with them altogether about 2 weeks.</span> <span id="s2960">Til we prepared those things.</span> <span id="s2961">And then later after, they wanted me to stay with them.</span> <span id="s2962">But I figured the war is closing and closing and I had enough and I wanted to be liberated.</span> <span id="s2963">Then I said to myself I will join the army.</span> <span id="s2964">I don't want to be in the woods anymore.</span> <span id="s2965">But the main thing, the longest time I was with the Jewish group, but unfortunately, there was very, very few left of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2966">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2967">If you can, tell me about when you were poisoned.</span></p> <p><span id="s2968">04:45:</span></p> <p><span id="s2969">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s2970">This was after we were shot by...when I was shot by the Agustins by the two brothers what I killed them.</span> <span id="s2971">And I went to the AK.</span> <span id="s2972">But my brother, as we run away from them, it was a very high snow.</span> <span id="s2973">We stopped on the way by a friendly peasant and he gave us some old clothing and also he gave me a pair of shoes which fitted me.</span> <span id="s2974">But for my brother he didn't have shoes because they didn't fit my brother...the too large foot.</span> <span id="s2975">So we had to run away.</span></p> <p><span id="s2976">And we went through a meadow which was low and it was covered with snow and underneath it was water, but was it covered with a very thin layer of ice.</span> <span id="s2977">And as we walked, he broke the ice and the ice was so sharp that it cut his feet and it cut off the skin.</span> <span id="s2978">He didn't feel it because it was very cold.</span> <span id="s2979">When we came to our group, we saw that his feet are without skin.</span> <span id="s2980">Naturally, we washed.</span> <span id="s2981">We couldn't go to a doctor.</span> <span id="s2982">We washed, and we put in some bandages.</span> <span id="s2983">And he had to put some place to recuperate.</span> <span id="s2984">So we brought him back to the same village where this shooting went on, but to a peasant.</span> <span id="s2985">His name was Avisha...that he used to work for my father.</span> <span id="s2986">He used to bring merchandise to my father.</span> <span id="s2987">And we trusted him.</span> <span id="s2988">And I didn't want to show that I am there.</span> <span id="s2989">Because even my brother would be there, they would be afraid to do something to him I should remain as a witness.</span> <span id="s2990">So my brother...I left him on the roof [attic?]</span> <span id="s2991">in the stable and when he came to milk the cows he told them he's there.</span> <span id="s2992">And he used to bring him every day about 5, 6 o'clock a quart of soup.</span> <span id="s2993">And this was his food that he ate, that he brought him.</span> <span id="s2994">Every evening he brought him a hot quart of soup.</span> <span id="s2995">One day I came over there.</span> <span id="s2996">And he noticed me.</span> <span id="s2997">And I was afraid that he should see me there.</span> <span id="s2998">Even I trusted him, but I figured those two boys were his friends and they belonged to the same group.</span></p> <p><span id="s2999">When he noticed me, the same day, he didn't bring us food.</span> <span id="s3000">And I told him, "I am here, but I want to tell you one thing.”</span> <span id="s3001">I asked him, what's going on in this village?"</span> <span id="s3002">He said, "Nothing, Nothing.”</span> <span id="s3003">And I didn't believe him because it was not nothing.</span> <span id="s3004">I killed two of the best boys in this village.</span></p> <p><span id="s3005">04:48: How could be nothing nothing?</span> <span id="s3006">He didn't tell me this.</span> <span id="s3007">And everybody knew that I did it.</span> <span id="s3008">So when it was dark he didn't bring the food like every evening.</span> <span id="s3009">Usually he brought the food about 5, 6 o'clock.</span> <span id="s3010">It was 7 o'clock.</span> <span id="s3011">He didn't bring the food.</span> <span id="s3012">It was 8 o'clock.</span> <span id="s3013">He came over and he brought a quart, he brought a pot with soup.</span> <span id="s3014">Usually, it was hot.</span> <span id="s3015">This time it was cold.</span> <span id="s3016">And he left.</span> <span id="s3017">Usually, he waited til my brother would finish the soup, and he would take back the pot.</span> <span id="s3018">This time he gave it and he run away.</span> <span id="s3019">He went away.</span> <span id="s3020">So I said to my brother, I said, "Don't eat it because I don't trust it for a few reasons.</span> <span id="s3021">The first thing I'm here with you.</span> <span id="s3022">They know they got us both together.</span> <span id="s3023">The second thing he usually brought it between 5 and 6.</span></p> <p><span id="s3024">Now it's already 8.</span> <span id="s3025">Why so different?</span> <span id="s3026">Always, it was hot.</span> <span id="s3027">Now it's cold.</span> <span id="s3028">He always waited for the empty pot.</span> <span id="s3029">Now he didn't wait.</span> <span id="s3030">He went away.</span> <span id="s3031">So he said, "Oh, we can trust him.</span> <span id="s3032">Don't think that he will do something.”</span> <span id="s3033">I said, "No, I will not eat it.</span> <span id="s3034">And you don't eat it.</span> <span id="s3035">I advise you.”</span> <span id="s3036">He started to eat it.</span> <span id="s3037">And when he start to eat, after a while he started to scream...he said, "I don't feel good.</span> <span id="s3038">I have pains.</span> <span id="s3039">I have cramps.</span> <span id="s3040">I think I'm poisoned.”</span> <span id="s3041">So I poured out the soup.</span> <span id="s3042">I said, "Wait.”</span> <span id="s3043">And I jumped on downstairs the stable, and I started to milk the cow.</span> <span id="s3044">And I milked a full pot of milk and I came up and I said to him, "Drink the milk, the whole thing and then later, try to throw up " So he drink the milk, put in his finger in his mouth and his throat and he threw up.</span> <span id="s3045">I said, "Now, let's go.”</span> <span id="s3046">Now he still had trouble with his feet, but we went down.</span> <span id="s3047">I said, "I want to wait.</span> <span id="s3048">I want to see who is coming for our bodies.”</span> <span id="s3049">So we were waiting there on the opposite side.</span> <span id="s3050">Was very cold.</span> <span id="s3051">And this I remember how cold it was.</span> <span id="s3052">And it took about 20 minutes.</span> <span id="s3053">Four guys came in with flashlights and I saw them going in in the stable and there was a loft, came up the ladder with a flashlight, took a second there.</span> <span id="s3054">They came down and they started to run.</span> <span id="s3055">They run away, and then said to him, "Now, we can go.”</span> <span id="s3056">But I knew...I knew who came so I said to him, "We will wait about a week or two and we will burn their houses.”</span> <span id="s3057">This, Franek Zavishes house I didn't touch.</span></p> <p><span id="s3058">Because he really was nice, and maybe they forced him to do it.</span> <span id="s3059">But others I said, "After a few weeks, we will burn their houses.”</span> <span id="s3060">See they were afraid to come and to shoot because I told them, "Anybody who will come up on the attic and he will show his head, I will blow</span></p> <p><span id="s3061">04:51: his head off.”</span> <span id="s3062">So after the war, after the liberation, I invited this Franek when I was a big shot in Krakow, so I invited Franek to come to Krakow, and he came.</span> <span id="s3063">And I asked him in this time, I said, "Tell me the truth.</span> <span id="s3064">What happened this night?"</span> <span id="s3065">So he tells me there was a doctor who belonged to his group.</span> <span id="s3066">His name was Vosna Volski.</span> <span id="s3067">After they told him that I am coming there, he gave them four pills of poison.</span> <span id="s3068">And the four pills he suppose to put in in our food, but he didn't want to kill us.</span> <span id="s3069">This what he told me.</span> <span id="s3070">He didn't want to kill us.</span> <span id="s3071">He only wanted to threaten us.</span> <span id="s3072">So he only put in one pill.</span> <span id="s3073">And later I find out that one pill could kill 25 people, not two.</span> <span id="s3074">But he wanted to scare us we should run away so he put in only one pill and three he didn't put in.</span> <span id="s3075">This he told me after we were liberated and he came.</span> <span id="s3076">And my wife</span></p> <p><span id="s3077">04:52: was sitting there because I knew her in this time.</span> <span id="s3078">And then then I knew which doctor and how it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s3079">Q: Very briefly in about three minutes.</span> <span id="s3080">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3081">Q: Tell me.</span> <span id="s3082">After liberation, you joined the Polish Army.</span> <span id="s3083">Tell me about that.</span> <span id="s3084">A: After the liberation, the same week, I joined the Polish Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s3085">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3086">A: I went and I joined.</span> <span id="s3087">I didn't have to go, but I joined and I wanted to be a part of the Polish Army, and I volunteered to join the air force.</span> <span id="s3088">Because I wanted they should teach me and I should be a pilot and maybe I will be able to bomb Germany.</span> <span id="s3089">And the school for officers for the air force was in Kuibichov.</span> <span id="s3090">This was in Siberia in Russia.</span> <span id="s3091">So when I waited for a transported, then I met a young Polish officer.</span> <span id="s3092">She was a beautiful, nice girl in that uniform.</span> <span id="s3093">She went through us, and we waited for the transport for the train to come.</span> <span id="s3094">And we started to talk.</span> <span id="s3095">And she said, "What're you doing here?"</span> <span id="s3096">And I told this.</span> <span id="s3097">She said, "Well, you're going to be a pilot.</span> <span id="s3098">It takes 2 years.”</span> <span id="s3099">The war wouldn't last 2 years anymore.</span> <span id="s3100">So why don't you come with me and you join our unit.</span> <span id="s3101">We have a special unit, and if you want to take revenge, you will take plenty of revenge.”</span> <span id="s3102">And I said, "How can I do it.</span> <span id="s3103">I have already the orders to go.”</span> <span id="s3104">She said, "Don't worry.”</span> <span id="s3105">And she took me to her colonel and she showed him the orders.</span> <span id="s3106">He took the orders and he ripped them up and he said, "From now on, you will be with us.”</span> <span id="s3107">And I joined them, and this is how I joined, this is how I met my wife.</span> <span id="s3108">Because after six months, when we had to liberate Krakow, so I was already a big shot in this time and I came to Krakow and then when I find out about my wife and I came to have her killed.</span> <span id="s3109">And this is a different story and this my wife probably will tell the story.</span> <span id="s3110">Because Krakow had to be destroyed completely.</span> <span id="s3111">And my wife was the secretary of the company who made the barricades and before we entered Krakow, we had to find somebody to get the plans to dismantle those barricades and through channels and channels we find out that it's her and three were sent out to get those plans.</span> <span id="s3112">And I was one of the three.</span> <span id="s3113">This was one day before Krakow was liberated.</span> <span id="s3114">So I entered Krakow January the 18th 1945 and officially Krakow was liberated January the 19th.</span> <span id="s3115">And my wife will tell you the rest story.</span> <span id="s3116">I thought she's German.</span> <span id="s3117">I hated her.</span> <span id="s3118">She was beautiful.</span> <span id="s3119">I saw my five sisters in here and we made up that after we get the plans, we'd kill her.</span> <span id="s3120">And then she looked at me.</span> <span id="s3121">When I came in, I started to interrogate her.</span> <span id="s3122">She thought I am the biggest anti-Semitic Pole.</span> <span id="s3123">She said, "You're a snob," but later she told me, "You're a snub nose and you're slavic, slavic face features.”</span> <span id="s3124">But anyway I find out that she's Jewish.</span> <span id="s3125">She find out I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s3126">She was very happy.</span> <span id="s3127">And this was our meeting.</span> <span id="s3128">And we had to still go through in the war...January, February, March, April, May...This was still war.</span> <span id="s3129">And then later in November, we got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s3130">04:55:30</span></p> <p><span id="s3131">Q: When did you come to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s3132">A: We came to the United States January 1947.</span> <span id="s3133">After I was transferred I escaped.</span> <span id="s3134">I was in the German zone in Germany about 6 months, and then we came to the United States.</span> <span id="s3135">We wanted to go to Palestine in this time, but it was impossible.</span> <span id="s3136">So we came to the United States with the thought of going from here to Palestine.</span> <span id="s3137">And this is other story.</span> <span id="s3138">This is the other chapter and another book.</span> <span id="s3139">But we are here, and we are very happy to be in America.</span></p> <p><span id="s3140">America did for me more than I expected.</span> <span id="s3141">I never dreamed that American can do this for me what actually I achieved.</span> <span id="s3142">And now we had a daughter.</span> <span id="s3143">We are very happy.</span> <span id="s3144">My daughter has three little boys.</span> <span id="s3145">And this is the most important thing is to show that Hitler didn't</span></p> <p><span id="s3146">04:56:30 completely succeed.</span> <span id="s3147">He wanted to erase every European Jew in the Jewish race, and we are a continuation.</span> <span id="s3148">Now one I want to tell you.</span> <span id="s3149">After the war, we contemplated...we didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s3150">I was already a Pole.</span> <span id="s3151">I had established position.</span> <span id="s3152">My wife was Polish, an established position.</span> <span id="s3153">And we didn't know.</span> <span id="s3154">She started to study medicine in Poland after the war.</span> <span id="s3155">So we didn't know what should we do.</span> <span id="s3156">Should we become Jews and run away or should we stay and be Poles and maybe to save our future generations the heartache and the problems that we had.</span> <span id="s3157">And we started to think about it.</span> <span id="s3158">What should we do?</span> <span id="s3159">And we decided no.</span> <span id="s3160">Because we cannot do it.</span> <span id="s3161">For two reasons.</span> <span id="s3162">My wife couldn't do it because she had her family and her grandmother, uncles and her sister in Palestine.</span> <span id="s3163">I couldn't do it because, it so happens we spoke yesterday about Kohanim.</span> <span id="s3164">I am from the line of Kohanim.</span> <span id="s3165">Now we know by Jews are very strict to follow male after male, and our lineage goes back til Aaron the high priest, the brother of Moses.</span> <span id="s3166">And I said, "Who am I to cut this chain.</span> <span id="s3167">My father was killed because he was a Jew.</span> <span id="s3168">Maybe his forefathers were killed because they were Jews.</span> <span id="s3169">I have no right to come to me...it reached me after 2...after three and and a half thousand years.</span> <span id="s3170">Because since Aaron is between three and and half thousand years and four
